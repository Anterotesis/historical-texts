 ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT  DIALOGUE II  By Mr  POPE  DUBLIN  Printed by R REILLY For G RISK G EWING W SMITH and G FAULKNER Booksellers MDCCXXXVIII  ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT  DIALOGUE II  A  TIS IS all a Libel  P  xt  n  Sir will say  B  Not' yet my Friend tomorrow 'faith it may  And for that very cause I print to day  How shou'd I fret to mangle ev'ry line  In rev'rence to the Sins of  Thirtynine  Vice with such Giantstrides comes on amain  Invention strives to be before in vain  Feign what I will and paint it e'er so strong  Some rising Genius sins up to my Song  A  Yet none but you by Name the Guilty lash  Ev'n  The Ordinary of  Newgate  who publishes the Memoirs of the Malefactors  Guthry  saves half  Newgate  by a Dash  Spare then the Person and expose the Vice  B  How Sir not damn the Sharper but the Dice  Come on then Satire gen'ral unconfin'd  Spread thy broad wing and sowze on all the Kind  Ye Statesmen Priests of one Religion all  Ye Tradesmen vile in Army Court or Hall  Ye Rev'rend Atheists  A  Scandal name them Who  B  Why that's the thing you bid me not to do  Who starv'd a Mother who forswore a Debt  I never nam'dthe Town's enquiring yet  The pois'ning Dame  A  You mean  B  I don't  A  You do  B  See now I keep the Secret and not you  The bribing Statesman  A  Hold too high you go  B  The brib'd Elector  A  There you stoop too low  B  I fain wou'd please you if I knew with what  Tell me which Knave is lawful Game which not  Must great Offenders once escap'd the Crown  Like Loyal Harts be never more run down  Admit your Law to spare the Knight requires  As Beasts of Nature may we hunt the Squires  Suppose I censureyou know what I mean  To save a Bishop may I name a Dean  A  A Dean Sir no his Fortune is not made  You hurt a man that's rising in the Trade  B  If not the Tradesman who sets up to day  Much less the 'Prentice who to morrow may  Down down proud Satire tho' a Land be spoil'd  Arraign no mightier Thief than wretched  Jonathan Wild  Wild    Or if a Court or Country's made a Job  Go drench a Pickpocket and join the Mob  But Sir I beg you for the Love of Vice  The matter's weighty pray consider twice  Have you less Pity for the needy Cheat  The poor and friendless Villian than the Great  Alas the small Discredit of a Bribe  Scarce hurts the Lawyer but undoes the Scribe  Then better sure it Charity becomes  To tax Directors who thank God have Plums  Still better Ministers or if the thing  May pinch ev'n therewhy lay it on a King  A  Stop stop  B  Must Satire then nor  rise  nor  fall    Speak out and bid me blame no Rogues at all  A  Yes strike that  Wild  I'll justify the blow  B  Strike why the man was hang'd ten years ago  Who now that obsolete Example fears  Ev'n  Peter  trembles only for his Ears  A  What always  Peter Peter  thinks you mad  You make men desp'rate if they once are bad  Else might he take to Virtue some years hence  B  As  S  k  if he lives will love the PRINCE  A  Strange spleen to  S  k    B  Do I wrong the Man  God knows I praise a Courtier where I can  When I confess there  is  who feels for Fame  And melts to Goodness need I SCARBROW name  Pleas'd let me own in  Esher  's peaceful Grove  The House and Gardens of  Esher  in  Surry  design'd by Mr  Kent  Where  Kent  and Nature vye for PELHAM's Love  The Scene the Master opening to my view  I fit and dream I see my CRAGS anew  Ev'n in a Bishop I can spy Desert  Secker  is decent  Rundel  has a Heart  Manners with Candour are to  Benson  giv'n  To  Berkley  ev'ry Virtue under Heav'n  But does the Court a worthy Man remove  That instant I declare he has my Love  I shun his Zenith court his mild decline  Thus SOMMERS once and HALIFAX were mine  Oft in the clear still Mirrour of Retreat  I study'd SHREWSBURY the wise and great  CARLETON's calm Sense and STANHOPE's noble Flame  Compar'd and knew their gen'rous End the same  How pleasing ATTERBURY's softer hour  How shin'd the Soul unconquer'd in the Tow'r  How can I PULT'NEY CHESTERFIELD forget  While  Roman  Spirit charms and  Attic  Wit  ARGYLE the States whole Thunder born to wield  And shake alike the Senate and the Field  Or WYNDHAM arm'd for Freedom and the Throne  The Master of our Passions and his own  Names which I long have lov'd nor lov'd in vain  Rank'd with their Friends not number'd with their Train  And if yet higher the proud List should end  Still let me say No Follower but a Friend  Yet think not Friendship only prompts my Lays  I follow  Virtue  where she shines I praise  Point she to Priest or Elder Whig or Tory  Or round a Quaker's Beaver cast a Glory  I never to my sorrow I declare  Din'd with the MAN of ROSS or my  Sir John Barnard  LORD MAY'R  Some in their choice of Friends nay look not grave  Have still a secret Byass to a Knave  To find an honest man I beat about  And love him court him praise him in or out  A  Then why so few commended  B  Not so fierce  Find you the Virtue and I'll find the Verse  But random Praisethe Task can ne'er be done  Each Mother asks it for her Booby Son  Each Widow asks it for the Best of Men  For him she weeps and him she weds again  Praise cannot stoop like Satire to the Ground  The Number may be hang'd but not be crown'd  Enough for half the Greatest of these days  To 'scape my Censure not expect my Praise  Are they not rich what more can they pretend  Dare they to hope a Poet for their Friend  What  Richlieu  wanted  Louis  scarce could gain  And what young  Ammon  wish'd but wish'd in vain  No Pow'r the Muse's Friendship can command  No Pow'r when Virtue claims it can withstand  To  Cato    Virgil  pay'd one honest line  O let my Country's Friends illumin mine  What are you thinking  A  Faith the thought's no Sin  I think your Friends are out and would be in  B  If merely to come in Sir they go out  The way they take is strangely round about  A  They too may be corrupted you'll allow  B  I only call those Knaves who are so nowâ–ª  Is that too little Come then I'll comply  Spirit of  Arnall  aid me while I lye  Cobbam  's a Coward  Polwarth  is a Slave  And  Lyttleton  a dark designing Knave  St  John  has ever been a wealthy Fool  But let me add Sir  Robert  's mighty dull  Has never made a Friend in private life  And was besides a Tyrant to his Wife  But pray when others praise him do I blame  Call  Clodius    Wolsey  any odious name  Why rail they then if but a Wreath of mine  Oh Allaccomplish'd St  John  deck thy Shrine  What shall each spurgall'd Hackney of the Day  When  Pax  n  gives him double Pots and Pay  Or each newpension'd Sycophant pretend  To break my Windows if I treat a Friend  Then wisely plead to me they meant no hurt  But 'twas my Guest at whom they threw the dirt  Sure if I spare the Minister no rules  Of Honour bind me not to maul his Tools  Sure if they cannot cut it may be said  His saws are toothless and his Hatchets Lead  It anger'd  Turenne  once upon a day  To see a Footman kick'd that took his pay  But when he heard th'Affront the Fellow gave  Knew one a Man of Honour one a Knave  The prudent Gen'ral turn'd it to a jest  And begg'd he'd take the pains to kick the rest  Which not at present having time to do  A  Hold Sir for God's sake where's th' Affront to you  Against your worship what has  S  k  writ  When did  Ty  l  hurt you with his Wit  Or grant the Bard whose Distich all commend    In Pow'r a Servant out of Pow'r a Friend    To  W  le  guilty of some venial Sin  What's that to you who ne'er was out nor in  The Priest whose Flattery bedropt the Crown  How hurt he you he only stain'd the Gown  And how did pray the Florid Youth offend  Whose Speech you took and gave it to a Friend  B  Faith it imports not much from whom it came  Whoever borrow'd could not be to blame  Since the whole House did afterwards the same  Let Courtly Wits to Wits afford supply  As Hog to Hog in Huts of  Westphaly    If one thro' Nature's Bounty or his Lord's  Has what the frugal dirty soil affords  From him the next receives it thick or thin  As pure a Mess almost as it came in  The blessed Benefit not there confin'd  Drops to the third who nuzzles close behind  From tail to mouth they feed and they carouse  The last full fairly gives it to the  House  A  This filthy Simile this beastly Line  Quite turns my Stomach  B  So does Flatt'ry mine  And all your Courtly CivetCats can vent  Perfume to you to me is Excrement  But hear me further  Japhet  'tis agreed  Writ not and  Chartres  scarce could write or read  In all the Courts of  Pindus  guiltless quite  But Pens can sorge my Friend that cannot write  And must no Egg in  Japhet  's Face be thrown  Because the Deed he forg'd was not my own  Must never Patriot then declaim at Gin  Unless good man he has been fairly in  No zealous Pastor blame a failing Spouse  Without a staring Reason on his Brows  And each Blasphemer quite escape the Rod  Because the insult's not on Man but God  Ask you what Provocation I have had  The strong Antipathy of Good to Bad  When Truth or Virtue an Affront endures  Th' Affront is mine my Friend and should be yours  Mine as a Foe profess'd to false Pretence  Who think a Coxcomb's Honour like his Sense  Mine as a Friend to ev'ry worthy mind  And mine as Man who feel for all mankind  A  You're strangely proud  B  So proud I am no Slave  So impudent I own myself no Knave  So odd my Country's Ruin makes me grave  Yes I am proud I must be proud to see  Men not afraid of God afraid of me  Safe from the Bar the Pulpit and the Throne  Yet touch'd and sham'd by  Ridicule  alone  O sacred Weapon left for Truth's defence  Sole dread of Folly Vice and Insolence  To all but Heav'ndirected hands deny'd  The Muse may give thee but the Gods must guide  Rev'rent I touch thee but with honest zeal  To rowze the Watchmen of the Publick Weal  To Virtue's Work provoke the tardy Hall  And goad the Prelate slumb'ring in his Stall  Ye tinsel Insects whom a Court maintains  That counts your Beauties only by your Stains  Spin all your Cobwebs o'er the Eye of Day  The Muse's wing shall brush you all away  All his Grace preaches all his Lordship sings  All that makes Saints of Queens and Gods of Kings  All all bat Truth drops dead born from the Press  Like the last Gazette or the last Address  When black Ambition stains a Publick Cause  A Monarch's sword when mad Vainglory draws  Not  Waller  's Wreath can hide the Nation's Scar  Nor  Boileau  turn the  In his Ode on  Namur  where to use his own words  il a fait un Astre de la Plume blanche qui le Roy porte ordinairement a son Chapeau qui est en effet une espece de Comete fatale a nos ennemis  Feather to a Star  Not so when diadem'd with Rays divine  Touch'd with the Flame that breaks from  Virtue  's Shrine  Her Priestess Muse forbids the Good to dye  And ope's the Temple of Eternity  There other  Trophies  deck the truly Brave  Than such as  Anstis  casts into the Grave  Far other  Stars  than * and * * wear  And may descend to  Mor  ton  from  Stair  Such as on  Dr  Hough  Bishop of  Worcester  HOUGH's unsully'd Mitre shine  Or beam good DIGBY from a Heart like thine  Let Envy howl while Heav'ns whole Chorus sings  And bark at Honour not conferr'd by Kings  Let Flatt'ry sickening see the Incense rise  Sweet to the World and grateful to the Skies  Truth guards the Poet sanctifies the line  And makes Immortal Verse as mean as mine  Yes the last Pen for Freedom let me draw  When Truth stands trembling on the edge of Law  Here Last of  Briton's  let your Names be read  Are none none living let me praise the Dead  And for that Cause which made your Fathers shine  Fall by the Votes of their degen'rate Line  A  Alas alas pray end what you began  And write next winter more  Essays  on  Man  FINIS
