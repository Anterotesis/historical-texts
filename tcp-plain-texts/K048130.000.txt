you but I tremble to think of the dreadful slaughter those poor fellows may be exposed to  Lenox  Dreadful Isn't it glory  AIR IX  LENOX  I  Aspiring thoughts my breast expand  Ah why to me is given a soul  Proudly impatient of command  Yet doom'd by fate to bear controul  Oft at the haughty serjeant's will  A poor recruit thro' chilling morn  I've stood for hours the tedious drill  Sad object of his blows and scorn  II  Nor sunk my youthfull spirits then  Tho' fierce he poiz'd the dread rattan  I thus when taught to conquer men  Suppress'd the feelings of a man  And now the harvests warring

that I may enjoy it in comfort  Tactic  Mary Sinclair and Lenox are honest ladsI know they both love you but as the misery or happiness of marriage will chiefly affect you I leave the choice of a husband entirely to yourself my girl If Lenox is the man love favours him but if Sinclair what he loses in  love he must make up in honorgive him a kiss and a few of my best ruffled shirts and drop a tear and that affair's settled  Sinclair  Farewell  to Lenox  adieu  to Mary  Mary  Oh my heart will break dearest father can't you get him off  Tactic  Child I wish him too well even to attempt it
