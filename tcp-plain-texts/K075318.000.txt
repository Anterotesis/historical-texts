 NATURE in PERFECTION OR  The MOTHER unveil'd  BEING A Congratulatory POEM to Mrs  BRET  upon his MAJESTY's most gracious Pardon granted to Mr RICHARD SAVAGE Son of the late Earl  RIVERS  Mater ait tacta est dea Nomine Matris  Ovid  Utinam modo dicere Possem  Carmina digna dea certe est dea carmine digna  Virg  LONDON  Printed for T GREEN near  Charing Cross  and Sold by J ROBERTS at the  Oxford Arms  in  WarwickLane  MDCCXXVIII Price Sixpence  NATURE in PERFECTION OR  The MOTHER unveiled  LET hireling Poets ply their venal Lays  The Great the Pow'rful and the Rich to praise  Let Malecontents with Satire tickled be  And Lovesick Coxcombs sink in Simile  A diff'rent Theme my Verses shall employ  A Mother's Anguish and a Mother's Joy  And thou O  Bret  the softest of thy Kind  Accept this Picture of a Parent's Mind  If ever am'rous Plaint your Ear could please  Or Love or Pity on your Bosom seize  With fav'ring Smiles a wellmeant Song regard  And Oh forgive an unexperienc'd Bard  If faintly he describe the Bliss or Woe  Which only you who feel it truly know  From that sad Hour when your unhappy Son  Struck thro the Life that forfeited his own  What Doubts what Fears your anxious Soul posses'd  And tore the soft Asylum of your Breast  Oh where for Shelter shall the Afflicted fly  Or where expect a sweeter Sanctuary  Accus'd forlorn the muchlov'd Youth behold  Depriv'd of Freedom destitute of Gold  Gold that from Dungeons Criminals can free  And ev'n in  Newgate  offers Liberty  Prophets of Fate where rav'nous Vulturs ply'd  Cruel as Death as Death unsatisfied  Where Felons Murd'rers Traytors are secur'd  And if not guiltless uncondemn'd immur'd  Where thick built Walls th'imprison'd Wretch deprive  Almost of vital Air while yet alive  A Place which scarce the Grave to which it leads  In Damps in Darkness or in Stench exceeds  How did your Kindness ease this Lot severe  Your Fondness tend him and your Bounty chear  No Glympse of Joy your Pleasures then convey'd  Nor Midnight Ball nor Morning Masquerade  In vain to crouded Drawing Rooms you run  The Court a Desart seems without your Son  If sportive Youth with sparkling Vigour come  You see with secret Pain their opening Bloom  Why was my Son thus to yourself you say  As young and not so fortunate as they  Nor sight of Age your Passion can endure  And must my Son then leave me immature  Still others' Joys you view'd and tasted none  Still others' Griefs were lighter than your own  And still whate'er you hear whate'er you see  Is cause for Plaint and Food for Misery  Your soft Distress your Tenderness of Pain  Can never be describ'd or felt by Man  Your  Anna  dear taught by your matchless Mind  Copies that glorious Frailty of her kind  The Sister's Love in Time of Danger shown  Can only be transcended by your own  In his Defence mov'd your persuasive Tongue  Excus'd the Rash and pleaded for the Young  You Heav'n and Earth sollicite on his Side  No Friend unspoke to and no Art untried  Your Art your Importunity is weak  You move resistless if the Mother speak  How vainly I recall my num'rous Fears  The Pains he cost me in his Infant Years  Was it for this I bore him on my Knees  Was all my Foresight were my Throes for this  Each pleasing Hope that with his Life began  All dash'd preserv'd the Boy but lost the Man  Strike me and spare my Child Oh let me save  The Life by Friendship I by Nature gave  So Birds by Instinct taught supply with Food  And chear with genial Warmth their callow Brood  And oft their kind maternal Breasts expose  To guard their helpless Young from threat'ning Foes  Fearless and fierce unequal Fight maintain  And dye themselves e'er see their Offspring slain  The Doom once past o'er his devoted Head  The Sword  hangs threat'ning by a single Thread  While bent with Chains the Weight he scarcely bore  Which gall'd the Wearer much the Mother more  Who can the Tortures of your Soul declare  Your Noontide Labours and your Midnight Prayer  Let meaner Friends to view the Pris'ner go  Whose slighter Love can bear that Sight of Woe  A Sight too shocking for a Mother's Eye  Which yet your utmost Caution cannot flye  Still to your Mind the darling Youth appears  And racks your Bosom with tormenting Fears  Present wheree'er you move the Phantom seems  And haunts with ghastly Shapes your Morning Dreams  The Scene of Justice to your sleeping Eyes  Stands terribly display'dand now he dies  Thick to your Heart the vital Currents run  You start and waking cryMy Son My Son  Let none object you no Concern reveal'd  Fire oft glows fiercest that is most conceal'd  Great Griefs are speechless petty Sorrow speaks  The Heart which vents its Anguish never breaks  Your Woes the old poetic Tales revive  And Credit to their wildest Fables give  So  Niobe  when in her Presence fell  The boasted Offspring she had lov'd too well  Thro Horror stiff beheld with  stupid  Eye  The last fair Rival of th' Immortals die  While mightier Grief than e'er by Words was shown  Transform'd the silent Mourner to a  Stone  By Nature touch'd his Pardon all desire  And imitate the Virtue they admire  Unite his dire Misfortune to bemoan  And join in Crowds to supplicate the Throne  Who e'er the Mother view'd her Offspring lov'd  His Hundreds He but She her Thousands mov'd  From Breast to Breast contagious Mercy crept  And Fops and Statesmen wonder'd why they wept  Hearts hard before unwonted Yearning know  Ev'n Jaylers melted at a Mother's Woe  But see he lives whose Death you late deplor'd  And angry Justice sheaths her awful Sword  Unhop'dfor Joy th' Imperial Mercy brings  Mercy the best Prerogative of Kings  With Triumph now you see the Tempest o'er  With Raptures mighty as your Grief before  Not so TYRCONNEL welcom'd the Relief  Inferior in his Joy as in his Grief  Stranger to Motions of a Mother's Mind  In Manners diff'rent as in Kindred join'd  Since for your Seed such Kindness you express  Oh may each Child give equal Happiness  With boundless Gratitude your Bosom burns  Your Taste for Pleasures and for Court returns  To Minds transported ev'ry Thing is gay  And  January  's self appears like  May  Each Change of Time in Extacy is lost  Nor Age feels Winter nor  December  Frost  Of bright now brighter shine your lovely Eyes  And wing'd with Joy th' exalted Spirits rise  New Warmth new Vigour to your Veins impart  And dance tumultuous to your beating Heart  But Oh beware and curb th' o'erflowing Tide  For oft the Overfortunate have died  Whom Grief in vain had labour'd to destroy  Surpris'd unequal to Excess of Joy  And ah too far th' unwieldy Joy prevails  For Life itself may sink when Reason fails  Since oft so high your Extacies have grown  You seem'd the Ties of Nature to disown  Lost for a While to Mem'ry you disclaim  A Child so dearly lov'd and Mother's Name  What dang'rous Transport parent Hearts may feel  Let  Ovid  soft the Lady's Poet tell  Thus old  Agave  mad denies her Boy  Possess'd with frantic  Bacchanalian  Joy  Knows not his Form but with distracted Roar  Mistakes her Offspring for a ForestBoar  Runs to compleat his Death exulting on  And slays a Monster while She kills her Son  Soon as the short  Delirium  past you find  And Sense regains it's Empire o'er the Mind  You bless the Hand that eas'd your anxious Cares  And pour for  Brunswick  's House incessant Prayers  Let the King live thus speaks your ardent Zeal  Long live a Parent's Happiness to feel  May Peace for ever bless the sacred Line  That ev'ry Son may live as well as mine  Not equal Gladness o'er your Bosom spread  When first the Infant bless'd your genial Bed  Not half the Mother's Transport did you find  For what is Body's Ease to Ease of Mind  Nor when his Prattling did your Ears engage  And promised Wonders in his riper Age  Nor when the Race of Youth he gayly ran  And rose thro' various Hazards up to Man  As when Great  Caesar  spoke the Royal Word  Which him to Life and you to Peace restor'd  Both by their Sov'reign's Favour born anew  He twice a Son and twice a Mother you  FINIS  BOOKS  Sold by THOMAS GREEN Bookseller at  CharingCross  HISTORY of the Antiquities
