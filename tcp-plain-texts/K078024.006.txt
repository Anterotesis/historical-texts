Boletus  Boletus Cellulosus  According to  Herbst Archiv  it is usually found on plants of this genus It is not scarce in Germany  The vast addition of new species of Insects that  Fabricius  has made in his latter works renders it difficult and in some instances impossible to refer them to the system of  Linnaeus  and though we would at all times more willingly refer any new kind to that system and quote the Fabrician account amongst the synonyms than adopt the new generic distinctions of Fabricius or any other author we must not sacrifice propriety to predilection If Linnaeus himself had noticed many of the newly discovered kinds he must have altered and improved his system to admit them which is a great excuse for Fabricius having made so many genera  The little Insect before us may be referred to the Silpha genus of Linnaeus but as his definition of the Silphae has been subjected to so many objections and amendments of later authors we forbear placing it amongst them Linnaeus has made no distinction between such species as have perfoliated antennae and those with antennae increasing in bulk from the base to the end  Silpha Antennae  extrorsum crassiores  Elytra  marginata  Caput  prominens  Thorax  planiusculus marginatus  Linn Gen Ins  thereby including  S Vespillo  with  S thoracica  and  S obscura  though in an early edition of the  Fauna Suecica S Vespillo  was amongst the  Scarabaei  and the two last with the  Cassidae  Schoeffer  divided the Silphae of Linnaeus into two genera  Silpha  and  Peltis Geoffroy  arranged some of them amongst his  Dermestides  and formed his genus  Peltis  of such as have the thorax and elytra strongly margined and perfoliated antennae  Geoffroy  described our present subject under the name  Tritoma Fabricius  afterwards in his Mantissa arranged it under  Ips  a new genus formed from part of the  Silphae  of Linnaeus and  Dermestides  of Geoffroy In the Entomologia Systematica he has again separated the Ips and made  Mycetophagus  a new genus of fifteen species in which he includes this Insect  To those who have adopted the system of Fabricius it is unne∣cessary to say that the fundamental part of his arrangement is taken from the mouth of the Insect which certainly is objectionable be∣cause that part is dry and very frequently injured or destroyed in Insects that have been long in a cabinet and is very small in most kinds when allve so that though we have followed his arrangement in the generic definition we have been less prolix than a full eluci∣dation of it might require  The figures in the annexed

   This Insect was formerly held in great esteem amongst the English collectors on account of its rarity and has been purchased for their cabinets at a considerable price  Half a guinea was the usual price for a pair of them  The late Mr Bentley who  had been more than twenty years endeavouring to make his cabinet the most complete in England never met with it  About three years since they were taken in great plenty near London both at Battersea and Highgate and have been met with in other places since that time Like the Ephemerae and other gausewing Insects it delights in moist places particularly among the reeds The larva is unknown but we suppose that it lives in that state in the water and which most likely it does not leave till it becomes a winged creature The larva of some species of this genus feed on the smaller kinds of Insects  The wings are the most pleasing objects for the microscope that can be imagined the reticulations and feathered edges are so trans∣parent that they may be examined with the deepest magnifiers which is an advantage few objects of such a size possess The magnified figure is given with the natural size in the annexed plate  Fabricius has erroneously quoted the seventh and eighth figure of the fifth plate of  Schaeffer  's  Icones  which is certainly no other than the common kind Hemorobius perla and which is so often found in gardens

Insect has been confounded with Phalaena lubricipeda by Linnaeus he makes it the variety β after De Geer In this he has been followed by many other authors and though Roesel by giving the larva and pupa of each in two distinct plates evidently thought them different species his observations had no weight with other Naturalists even Fabricius in his  Species Insectorum  gives them  under one specific name In his last work  Entomologia Systematica  he has divided them leaving the P lubricipeda under its former name and giving the specific name Menthrastri to the white sort as had been done in  Wien Verz  Fabricius mentions it as a native of Germany but from the figure of Roesel no doubt can be entertained of its being precisely the same as our English species  The Caterpillars of both sorts are very general feeders they will eat oak fruit trees and wild plants of almost every kind They are common in the summer change to chrysalis about August and appear in the winged state in May and June but there is more than one brood of them in the course of the year so that the time of their appearance is uncertain The Caterpillars change their skins often and change their colours at the same time Those of Phalaena Menthrastri when small are a very light transparent brown then brown with dark stripes It is not black till it is in the last skin and then in many the colour inclines to brown  PLATE CXC SPHINX CELERIO SILVERSTRIPE HAWK MOTH LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae thickest in the middle Wings in general deflexed when at rest Fly slow Morning and evening only

The Sphinx Celerio stands preeminent in the list of the Insects of this country whether we consider its rarity or uncommon beauty Indeed amongst the Insects of this tribe that are brought from remote countries even from Asia which boasts the most splendid species the varieties of Sphinx Celerio are often the most beautiful it must however be owned that in countries where the  climate and luxuriance of the soil contribute to enrich the juices of the plants on which the Insects are nourished they are larger and their colours more vivid than any of the same kind produced in the northern countries of Europe  Several years since Mr Francillon of Norfolkstreet in the Strand had a living specimen of this Insect brought to him it was taken in Bunhillfields buryingground It is still preserved in his cabinet  We have heard of other specimens being taken in this country but the only instance we can quote with confidence is that Mr Latham formerly of Dartford and well known for his scientific researches in natural history has a specimen which was taken at Eltham in Kent Few collections of consequence are without this Insect but they are in general natives of Germany  Roesel has given a figure of this Sphinx with its larva and pupa and as we could never reasonably expect to meet with it in these states in England correct copies of his figures are given in Plate The works of Roesel are not in the hands of many and we are convinced that Plate will be acceptable to most of our readers  Sphinx Celerio is found on the vine  PLATE CXCII PHALAENA HEXAPTERATA SERAPHIM MOTH

   tab    fig    The Sirex genus as it stands in the  Entomologia Systematica  of Fabribius includes only twentysix species these are chiefly Euro∣pean Insects but very few are natives of this country The Sirex Gigas is found in the north of Europe it has been taken in England but very rarely Yeats and Berkenhout mention it as a British species and we have been informed that it is sometimes taken in Scotland It is likely to be met with in Pine forests as the female seems to prefer that wood to deposit her eggs in As no English Entomologist has attempted to describe the peculiar habits of this tribe of Insects and especially of Sirex Gigas the following particulars may be satisfactory to our readers  The extensive forests of Germany furnished the accurate Roesel with many opportunities of finding and observing the metamorphosis of Insects that are rarely to be found in other parts of Europe and this enabled him to favour the world with a particular description and series of figures of all the changes of Sirex Gigas in the  Bom∣byliorum et Vesparum  of his  Insecten Belustigung  His figure of the female Insect agrees with that we have given the male is consi∣derably smaller and has no sting  This is a generical distinction  The sting of the female consists of three parts a sheath which divides into two parts or valves and a fine instrument somewhat resembling a needle it is with this in∣strument it wounds its enemies and the sting is said to cause an excruciating pain The microscope discovers this part to be beset with a number of very minute teeth like the edge of a saw with this sting the creature can pierce the wood of sound trees for we suspect it does not always deposit its eggs in such as are decayed but rather in such as will supply the larva with nourishment when it is hatched The eggs are laid in clusters of two or three hundred together they are of a pale yellow colour about the thirtieth part of an inch in length and shaped like a weaver's shuttle The larva lives in the body of the tree enlarging its habitation as it increases in size for it never leaves the tree till it becomes a winged creature  The larva when full grown is about an inch and a quarter in length and as thick as a goose quill It is a heavy sluggish creature almost cylindrical the head very small and the whole of an uniform pellucid yellowish colour It has a small spine at the end of the body like those by which the larva of some spinges are distinguished this spine is also a striking character in the perfect Sirex In the pupa the form of the winged creature is more visible than in the larva state it is of a browner colour than the larva and the rudiment of the sting and legs are very visible  In the early editions of the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus the sirices are arranged with the ichneumons in one genus but later observations induced Linnaeus to make two genera of them in his last works  Geoffroy  and Schaeffer have added some particulars to the Linnaean generic character these principally relate to the num∣ber of joints in the tarsi  PLATE CXCVIII SCOLOPENDRA FORFICATA APTERA WITHOUT WINGS  GENERIC CHARACTER  The same number of feet as segments of the body

as this little creature may appear to the general reader the Entomologists of this country esteem it a rarity for it was not imagined that England produced any species of its singular genus till lately  Mr Yeats in his Institutions of Entomology mentions two spe∣cies of it that have been caught in this country one by Mr  Hudson  author of the  Flora Anglica  the other by Mr  Grey  It is to be lamented that he does not inform us precisely what were the species We learn that Fulgora Europaea was the Insect taken by Mr Hudson the other seems undetermined  The Fulgora Europaea very much resembles some of the Cicadae in form and size and have therefore been probably overlooked by English collectors of Insects Fabricius describes it as a native of France and Germany but it is very scarce in cabinets of foreign Insects also Perhaps it is not common in any country  This species does not exhibit any prominent features of its sin∣gular genus it has only a small conic hollow projection or lantern on the forepart of the head instead of the large projection that charac∣terise most of the exotic Fulgorae It is not unlikely however that it may possess though in a small degree the astonishing property of diffusing a radiance of light which particularly distinguish  F Lan∣ternarid  of South America  F Candelaria  of China and several other species The light of some of these Insects according to the reports of Naturalists and travellers in foreign countries is suffi∣ciently vivid and constant to answer many purposes Some of the Catholic missionaries assert that they could see distinctly to read and write by the light of one of them and that several of them being fastened together serve to light the Indians when they travel in the night  The rostrum or beak through which the Fulgorae Europaea like others of the same genus sucks its nutriment seems to form a part of the hollow projection in the front of the head the tube lays close to the belly between the six legs To explain the singular structure of this tube or rostrum we have given a front and a profile view of it as it appeared under the lens of a microscope  Our specimen is altogether green except the wings the recticu∣lations of which are also of the same colour and as in Sulzer's figure the clear parts of the wings were strongly tinged with green also  PLATE CCIV  FIG I SPHINX LINEATA LEPIDOPTERA

with yellow and some streaks and spots of red down the back it has also a large black spot on each side every segment the head is black and it has a spine or tail This is the appearance of it in one

Linnaean genera That author described only a small number of the species and was even doubtful whether several that were placed under that division of his system did not more properly belong to some other especially to the ichneumons among which several apterous insects are included  The cause of this uncertainty may be partly attributed to our entire ignorance of their manner of life or transformations Some of the Mutillae have wings and others are without Authors have con∣sidered the apterous Insects as the females and the winged kind as the males which opinion is countenanced by numberless instances in almost every class of Insects Others have however maintained that both males and females were winged and that the apterous In∣sects were neuters presuming in support of such opinion that the Mutillae lived in societies like the Wasps Ants and BeesFrom observations on a number of exotic species of this tribe we have no doubt that the winged Insects are males and the apterous kind females  Yeats alludes to three species of Mutillae that have been found in England but names only the Mutillae Europaea and this is the only kind we have ever found We have taken it on

larva state but as collectors have very rarely reared it from that state it has been difficult to determine its proper food Fabricius mentions lettuce and scabious or devil'sbit The larva is hairy and

of Linnaeus because  it appears to us more characteristic of the creature which should have a lengthened articulated tail terminated in a sharp crooked sting to warrant us in placing it among the Scorpions In the system of Fabricius this forms no part of his generical character but those who are accustomed to depend only on the writings of Linnaeus would be perplexed to reconcile the apparent difference between the Phalangia of that author and the Scorpio of Fabricius  The general appearance of this creature except the want of tail is precisely that of a Scorpion in miniature  Mr Adams in his Essay on the Microscope has figured and de∣scribed a new species of this genus it is smaller and differs in form from our present species he calls it the Lobster Insect We believe Phalangium Cancroides is the largest Insect of the genus found in England that resembles a Scorpion  This Insect is sometimes found in the covers of old books in rotten wood and other damp and decayed substances
