Printed for EDWARD and CHARLES DILLY in the Poultry And T CADELL in the Strand  MDCCLXXI  TO GEORGE COLMAN  Esq  DEAR SIR  WHEN I inscribe this Tragedy to you I mean to pay myself a very high compliment the utmost I could possibly say of you would by no means extend your Reputation but it will do me much honour to declare that so celebrated a writer has distinguished CLEMENTINA with the most essential attention and that so valuable a man has given me leave to sign myself what I truly am  DEAR SIR  His most faithful and most obliged humble servant The AUTHOR  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Author of this Tragedy has printed several lines for the Closet which in the Representation were omitted for the sake of brevityThe chief business of this advertisement however is to acknowledge his obligations to the inimitable performance of Mrs YATES and to thank Mr BENSLEY Mr SAVIGNY and Mr WROUGHTON for their great goodnature in undertaking their respective characters at the short notice of a week when Mr Ross unexpectedly returned the part of  Anselmo  This circumstance obliged Mr B  Y who was cast for  Palermo  to undertake Mr SAVIGNY'S part which was originally  Granville  Mr SAVIGNY taking  Anselmo  and Mr WROUGHTON  Palermo  which had been in his possession above a fortnight and left it no more than barely possible for the utmost diligence of these Gentlemen to exhibit a piece which the public have since been kindly pleased to honour with the most generous approbation  PROLOGUE  By GEORGE COLMAN  Esq  Spoken by Mr BENSLEY  IN these our moral and religious days  Men dread the crying sin of writing Plays  While some whose wicked wit incurs the blame  Howe'er they love the trespass fly the shame  If a new holy war with Vice to wage  Some preacher quits the pulpit for the stage  The Rev  rend Bard with much remorse and fear  Attempts to give his EveningLecture here  The work engender'd to the world must rise  But yet the father may elude our eyes  The parish on this trick of youth might frown  And thus unown'd 'tis thrown upon the Town  At our Director's door he lays the sin  Who sees the Babe relents and takes it in  To swathe and dress it first unstrings his purse  Then kindly puts it out to Youto nurse  Should some young Counsel thro' his luckless star  By writing Plays turn truant to the Bar  Call'd up by you to this High Court of Wit  With non  inventus  we return the writ  No  latitat  can force him to appear  Whose failure and success cause equal fear  Whatever fees his clients here bestow  He loses double in the Courts below  Grave solemn Doctors whose prescribing pen  Has in the trade of Death kill'd many men  With vent'rous quill here tremblingly engage  To slay Kings Queens and Heroes on the stage  The Great if great men write of shame afraid  Come forth  incog  and Beaux in masquerade  Some Demireps in wit of doubtful fame  Tho' known to all the town withhold their name  Thus each by turns ungratefully refuse  To own the favours of their LadyMuse  Woo'd by the Court the College Bar and Church  Court Bar Church College leave her in the lurch  'Tis your's tonight the work alone to scan  Arraign the bard regardless of the man  If Dulness waves her poppies o'er his play  To Critic fury let it fall a prey  But if his art the tears of Pity draws  Ask not his namebut crown him with applause  Dramatis Personae  ANSELMO  Mr SAVIGNY  GRANVILLE  Mr BENSLEY  PALERMO  Mr WROUGHTON  ADORNO  Mr GARDNER  CLEMENTINA  Mrs YATES  ELIZARA  Miss PEARCE  CITIZENS GUARDS  c  SCENE VENICE  TIMEThe Time of Representation  CLEMENTINA A TRAGEDY  ACT I  An Apartment in  ANSELMO  's Palace Enter  CLEMENTINA  and  ELIZARA  CLEMENTINA  DISTRACTION here so soon  ELIZARA  This very hour  Your good your noble yet misguided father  This moment chill'd me with the hated tale  Then seizing eagerly my trembling hand  "Tell Clementina tell your stubborn friend"  Cry'd he in accents positive and stern  "That brave Palermo just return'd from chains  "Chains greatly purchas'd in his country's cause  "Must now receive such welcome such affection  "As suits her virtue and Anselmo's daughter  "Tell her my word's irrevocably giv'n  "And bid her guard the honour of her father"  CLEMENTINA  Why let the storm exert its utmost rage  And burst in thunder on my wretched head  Let this severe this unrelenting father  Cast me a houseless wand'rer on the world  Yet shall my soul with unabating firmness  Deny her sanction to Palermo's claim  O Elizara you who know the cause  The endless cause of Clementina's tears  Who saw the awful tho' the secret rite  That gave this hand now widow'd to Rinaldo  Is there in all the various rounds of woe  A curse so great a pang so exquisite  As this poor breast is singled out to feel  ELIZARA  Indulge not thus a painful recollection  CLEMENTINA  Oh memory ev'n madness cannot lose it  Mangled with wounds amidst unnumber'd foes  My hapless husband for his country fell  Yet the sad story of our loves conceal'd  I was allow'd no privilege of tears  But doom'd to hide the anguish of my heart  And now in all the fulness of despair  To have another forc'd upon me horror  It is not to be borneBut I'm resolv'd  And will devote the remnant of my life  To lost Rinaldo's memory or die  Some little hour before my griefs would end me  ELIZARA  Alas I feel the sorrows of your bosom  With all the ardent sympathy of friendship  And know how souls so delicate as yours  Must spurn th' idea of a second lord  Yet blame no more the sternness of Anselmo  The antient hate too long too idly cherish'd  Between your angry father and Rinaldo's  First urg'd the measure of a private union  A stranger therefore to your grief Anselmo  Claims but the right which custom and which nature  Have long giv'n parents o'er their children's hearts  CLEMENTINA  What claim what right misjudging Elizara  Can tyrant custom plead or nature urge  To force the free election of the soul  Say should affection light the nuptial torch  Or should the rash decision of a father  Doom his sad race to wretchedness for ever  No Elizara custom has no force  Nature no right to sanctify oppression  And parents vainly tell us of indulgence  When they give all but happiness to children  ELIZARA  Trueyet a cruel crisis in your fate  Has much to offer for the good Anselmo  He fondly thinks his daughter disengag'd  Believes too fondly that Palermo's merit  Must touch the gentle bosom of my friend  If then determin'd to reject his choice  At once throw off constraintat once be open  And seal his lips for ever on the subject  By a frank mention of your fatal story  CLEMENTINA  What and expose my dear Rinaldo's kindred  To all the fury of enrag'd Anselmo  The now acknowledg'd ruler of the state  Who tho' renown'd for wisdom and for justice  Yet in the points the cruel points of honour  Is rigid stern and fatally severe  No Elizara tho' these fading eyes  No more must hope to gaze upon Rinaldo  Tho' the soulswelling language of my woes  Falls unregarded on the silent tomb  And boasts no pow'r to call my slaughter'd hero  From the dark dreary mansions of the dead  Still let me guard whatever he held dear  Nor pluck down added ruin on his house  ELIZARA  Anselmo's justice will o'ercome his hatred  Were he inclin'd to make his will his law  Or wish'd for means to gratify resentment  He has the pow'r already but his mind  Superior ever to the thought of wrong  Can feel no passion to disgrace his virtue  CLEMENTINA  The best may err nor will I tempt his rage  The mighty measure of my woe is full  Why then when fate's unmerciful decree  Has curs'd me up to such a height of ill  Why should I shudder at the gathering storm  Or seek for shelter in another's sorrow  I now have no asylum but the grave  Tho' did peace court me from the bow'rs of bliss  My soul would scorn to hear the charmer's voice  If she requir'd me to perform a deed  That either shock'd my justice or my honour  ELIZARA  Then summon all your firmness Clementina  For here Anselmo comes and brings Palermo  O that your terrors for Rinaldo's kindred  May stiil subside and hear the voice of reason  Your soul is ill adapted to disguise  And without cause to disappoint his views  Must be as fatal as to tell him all  CLEMENTINA  They're herelet us retirePalermo's presence  Is now a thousand deathsand tho' prepar'd  With fortitude to actstill Elizara  While I can shun the conflict let me spare  Spare ev'n the feelings of a cruel father  Exeunt  Enter  ANSELMO  and  PALERMO  ANSELMO  Gone so abruptlygone at our approach  And yet my son the crimson hue of virtue  Will always deepen at a lover's sight  Who comes to ask his certain day of transport  And knows the hour of apprehension o'er  PALERMO  'Tis just my lordBut still however lovely  The soft emotion of these gentle terrors  Spreads in the blooming daughters of perfection  Still Clementina might have kindly giv'n  A long lost lover welcome from his bonds  And nobly told him that his ruin'd fortunes  Were ev'n deem'd merit with Anselmo's daughter  ANSELMO  Think not Palermo of your ruin'd fortunes  My Clementina with her father's eyes  Regardless looks on dignity and wealth  And holds the mind preeminent in both  That boasts a bright preeminence in virtue  PALERMO  When sharp adversity has stung the mind  It makes us doubly conscious of neglect  And sure a soul less sensible than mine  Had room to start at Clementina's coldness  Judge then by all that headlong fire of youth  Which once swell'd up your own impassion'd breast  If I could let indifference pass unnotic'd  He never lov'd that bore a slight with temper  Nor ever merited a worthy heart  Who meanly stoop'd contented with a cold one  ANSELMO  No more my sonThis day rewards your suff'rings  For Clementina shall today be yours  And while love courts you with his ripest roses  The golden sun of honourable greatness  Shines out to crown you with his warmest beams  Our native landbut what exceeds all price  Our native liberty shall soon be ours  And soon Palermo nobly shall revenge  On haughty Ferdinand that scourge of earth  The wrongs illfated Venice has sustain'd  The wrongs which heedless of a soldier's glory  Th' imperial plund'rer on my son himself  So poorly meanly infamously heap'd  When in a base exaction for his ransom  He seiz'd his all nor left th' indignant warrior  A home to rest in from the weight of chains  Our French ally the noblyminded Lewis  This hour dispatches an embassador  To give our country renovated being  And burst asunder ev'ry yoke of Spain  PALERMO  The glorious news o'erpays an age of bonds  O for a curse a quick dispatching curse  To blast the ruthless tyrant on his throne  And mark him out thro' all succeeding ages  A dread example to despotic kings  But say and bless me with some certain hope  On what foundation does the royal Lewis  Bid us thus boldly considently look  For instant vengeance and for instant freedom  ANSELMO  That I am yet to learnBut noble still  I ever found him in our various treaties  And therefore cannot will not doubt him now  Sunk by his late distresses Ferdinand  Now mourns his dreams of universal empire  And shrinks in secret at the arms of France  PALERMO  Eternal praises to the God of battles  Yes scepter'd savage we may reach you yer  And boldly tell you in the face of nations  That royal robbers from unerring justice  Demand a double measure of perdition  The needy ruffian in his hour of hunger  Has some excuse for prowling on his neighbour  But when the arm the mighty arm of kings  That shou'd protect all mankind from oppression  Is stretch'd to seize on what it ought to guard  Then heaven's own brand in aggravated fire  Shou'd strike th' illustrious villain to his hell  And war in mercy for a groaning world  ANSELMO  Oh nobly saidOur cause is just and heaven  Fights on our side for late the Spanish troops  In two great fields were wholly overthrown  And fill'd the plains with myriads of their dead  Our navies too tho' some Venetian cities  Lye humbled still beneath the tyrant's yoke  Fill Spain with constant and with just alarms  For such a blaze of unexampled glory  Has crown'd the fleets entrusted to my care  That tho' depriv'd of more than half our realm  We still remain a formidable foe  And rule triumphant o'er the boundless wave  PALERMO  How the bright prospect bursts upon my view  And lifts me up in fancy to the stars  O did the fair the matchless Clementina  View me with eyes less rigidly severe  This one blest hour had madden'd me with rapture  ANSELMO  Again PalermoBut I cease to chide  And go my son to end your doubts for ever  If I know aught of Clementina's heart  'Twill beat in honest unison to mine  And give an added welcome to your claim  Because you've now an added need of fortune  PALERMO  Too generous Anselmo  ANSELMO  Nay no thanks  The man who bears not to a friend distress'd  A double will to ratify engagements  Stands selfconvicted at the bar within  The base assassin of his native honour  Exit  PALERMO  alone  Why did I wound his venerable bosom  With any doubt of Clementina's truth  And yet disquiet hangs about my heart  A secret voice incessantly suggests  That Clementina was not born for me  But let me not anticipate misfortune  When fate has struck 'tis time enough to feel  And he is best prepar'd against the blow  Whose conscious virtue never has deserv'd it  Exit  Scene changes to  CLEMENTINA  'S Apartment  CLEMENTINA  alone  Now Clementinanow the trial comes  Call up th' inherent greatness of your soul  And shew Anselmo shew this rigid sire  That his own firmness animates his daughter  What does he think that force can move my temper  No sacred spirit of my dear Rinaldo  It kindly hov'ring round your wretched wife  You still observe her in this world of woe  Look and applaud her in an hour of terror  Look and behold how faithful to her vows  She braves a sure destruction for your sake  Braves all the stings of poverty and scorn  Her father's fury and her house's hate  To live the ceaseless mourner of your fall  Enter  ANSELMO  ANSELMO  Well ClementinaHave I yet a daughter  CLEMENTINA  Say rather Sirif I have yet a father  ANSELMO  Yes Clementina an unhappy father  Who now implores compassion from his child  I see I see with infinite regret  Your scorn your fix'd aversion to Palermo  And tho' I came determin'd to exact  A strict a rigid instance of your duty  My aching soul quite melted at your tears  Rejects the sterner sentiment of force  And bends the weeping suppliant to a daughter  CLEMENTINA  O could the secret volume of my heart  Be laid this moment openly to view  My father there would read my pride to please him  Let him ask all from Clementina's duty  Which wretched Clementina can perform  Let him do this and he's at once obey'd  But when he asks her to direct her wishes  To turn the mighty current of the mind  And join the streams the everwarring streams  Of boundless love and limitless aversion  There he exceeds her utmost stretch of pow'r  And only gives occasion for her tears  ANSELMO  Look round on all th' accomplish'd sons of Venice  And say who shines superior to Palermo  Take then his hand and bless your doating father  Let us not now in poverty desert him  Nor aid the arrow of a galling need  With the keen dart of disappointed love  No Clementina let us nobly claim  A great alliance with his ruin'd fortunes  And give a bright example to our country  That worth is all things with the truly worthy  CLEMENTINA  Palermo's merits and Palermo's wants  Alike receive my praises and my pity  But venerable Sir if e'er my peace  My soul's dear peace was tender to your thoughts  Spare me O spare me on this cruel subject  Let the brave youth so honour'd with your friendship  Partake your wealth but do not kill your daughter  Do not to give him a precarious good  Doom me to certain wretchedness for ever  I have an equal claim upon your heart  And call as much for favour as Palermo  ANSELMO  A little time sweet soother of my age  Will charm that gentle bosom into rest  And ev'n return Palermo love for love  Then Clementina O my soul's whole comfort  Refuse a kneeling father if you can  Kneels  Here at your feet the author of your being  Who never stoop'd to aught before but heaven  Begs for compassionMust he beg in vain  CLEMENTINA  O mercy mercy Will you kill your daughter  Rise Sir O rise and save me from distraction  ANSELMO  rising  My word my child has never yet been broken  Do not in age expose me to dishonour  Save your poor father at the verge of life  O nobly save him from the guilt of falshood  In this reversal of Palermo's fortunes  The sland'rous tongue of all my house's foes  Will mark me out to universal shame  And tell the world his poverty alone  Has lost the daughter of the base Anselmo  CLEMENTINA  No moreI yieldand am a wretch for ever  ANSELMO  O say not so my heart's supreme delight  Applanding heav'n shall bless your filial virtue  And give your heart that joy you give your rather  My transport grows too mighty to be borne  O let me hasten to the brave Palermo  And raise him from despondency to rapture  Exit  CLEMENTINA  alone  Rinaldo's widow wedded to Palermo  Where shall I now find refuge from reflection  Or how root up the agonizing thought  That brings this horrid marriage to my view  I was prepar'd for all a father's fury  But was not arm'd against a father's tears  How could I see him weeping at my feet  Tost in a whirlwind of contending passions  And yet retain the purpose of my soul  Ev'n if the sainted spirit of my husband  From the bright mansions of eternal day  Beheld the anguish of his struggling heart  It must have kindly prompted me to pity  O this PalermoThis detested union  Married to himThe widow of Rinaldo  Give me ye blessed ministers of peace  Some instant portion of that soothing stream  Which pours a deep oblivion on the mind  And drowns the sense of memory for ever  ACT II  An Apartment in  ANSELMO  's Palace Enter  GRANVILLE  and  ELIZARA  ELIZARA  AND is it possible Do I once more  Behold Rinaldo  GRANVILLE  Yes my Elizara  Yet oh take heed sweet maid alone to know me  For what I seemTh' ambassador of France  As such alone Anselmo has receiv'd me  And such my king confirms meBut declare  How fares my ClementinaHow does she  Support the oft proclaim'd the general tale  That now six moons has rank'd me with the dead  ELIZARA  She bears it like a wife that truly lov'd  But by what miracle again restor'd  Acquaint mefor concurring multitudes  Beheld your fall in battle and reported  That in a pile of greatlyslaughter'd heroes  A Gallic squadron bore you from the field  GRANVILLE  I fell indeed amidst the gen'ral carnage  And lay some hours among the honour'd dead  For whom the vanquish'd France's gen'rous sons  Made one bold effort to obtain a grave  Here a brave youth of that exalted nation  Close by whose side with emulative fire  I sought for Venice on that hapless day  Beheld the man he deign'd to call his friend  And by a kind of miracle restor'd me  Then to the king in terms of warmest weight  Proclaim'd my fancied meritsRoyal Lewis  Received the story with a gracious ear  And pour'd profuse his favours on Rinaldo  ELIZARA  Why then O why distinguish'd thus thus honour'd  Did not Rinaldo sooth his sorrowing friends  And ease the torments of a wife's despair  GRANVILLE  O Elizara how my soul has felt  For all the anguish she was doom'd to suffer  That heaven which knows the greatness of my love  Alone can witnessBut the conquering arms  Of widely wasting Ferdinand cut off  Our commerce with the worldand had not fate  In two late fields propitious smil'd upon us  Rinaldo yet distracted and forlorn  Had drag'd a chain of miserab'le being  Nor known as now he shall th' extatic bliss  Of speaking peace to weeping Clementina  ELIZARA  But whence this transformationWhy conceal'd  Beneath the garb of France does brave Rinaldo  So closely seek to hide himself in Granville  GRANVILLE  For ends of momentIf the charge I bear  Meets as I hope and as I think it ought  A warm reception from AnselmoThen  I come determin'd to avow my marriage  And gracious Lewis will I trust remove  The fatal feuds that shake our angry houses  ELIZARA  But shou'd Anselmo disapprove your charge  What measure then remains to be pursu'd  And what becomes of weeping Clementina  GRANVILLE  There my disguise is suited to assist me  Shou'd he refuse to join the views of France  My orders are that instant to return  And my design to bear off Clementina  ELIZARA  You talk Rinaldo with an air of triumph  Think you the first of our Venetian daughters  Can in a moment thus be borne away  Borne from her palace compass'd round with guards  Surrounding virgins and a watchful father  GRANVILLE  My name conceal'd and all my train instructed  My king's credentials bearing but the title  Which he himself has giv'n me and which yet  Has reach'd no ear of Venice but your own  Can there exist a doubt of my success  Unknownunnotic'dunsuspected quite  A trusty friend shall lead her to the beach  If Clementina like myself disguis'd  Will venture aught to bless her faithful husband  ELIZARA  Rinaldo shou'd pursue a diff'rent course  A course more suited to his worth and honour  Now independent now so rais'd in France  What can you dread from Venice or its leader  Your fortunes now are equal to your birth  Shou'd then your embassy displease Anselmo  Act like yourselfthrow off this dark disguise  And nobly claim your wifeYou know his justice  And know besides he cannot hate you farther  GRANVILLE  Fain gentle maid wou'd I pursue this counsel  And in the face of day assert my right  But if the purport or my public business  Which heaven avert shou'd raise Anselmo's anger  My life once known must expiate my crime  I come I hope to blese the state of Venice  But I come also with a foreign ruler  This you know well is death by law declar'd  Nor cou'd th' ambassador of France preserve  Th' offending subject from the stroke of justice  ELIZARA  May heaven indulgent smile upon your hopes  But oh I dread I dread a disappointment  And see impatience frowning on his brow  Hither Anselmo comesLet me fly hence  And bless my friend with tidings of her lord  Exit  Enter  ANSELMO  with Papers  ANSELMO  Well Sir the views of Lewis are at length  Reveal'd and here I see he speaks them plainly  GRANVILLE  Why sage Anselmo this offended brow  I trust my master's offers have deserv'd  Your highest approbation for they breathe  Nought but attachment and regard for Venice  ANSELMO  Is this the basis of his love for Venice  Has he stood forth a champion for our freedom  Merely himself to tread us into slaves  And sav'd us from the arm of haughty Spain  To make us bear his own oppressive yoke  Go tell your king and tell him from Anselmo  That France and Venice can be friends no more  Tell him to us all tyrants are the same  Or if in bonds the neverconquer'd soul  Can feel a pang more keen than slav'ry's self  'Tis when the chains that crush us into dust  Are forg'd by hands from which we hop'd for freedom  GRANVILLE  And what idea does my business raise  Of slaves or tyrants servitude or chains  'Tis true the gracious Lewis has propos'd  To take the state of Venice to his care  If sage Anselmo her illustrious leader  Approves the scheme of wellconcerted empire  He sees with deep with noblyminded sorrow  How still expos'd to ev'ry pow'rful neighbour  You fall a victim to alternate spoilers  Hence with paternal tenderness he wishes  T' enroll your sons among the sons of France  And make the subjects of his diff'rent realms  One equal common and united people  If this be slav'ry  ANSELMO  'Tis the worst of slav'ry  Tamely to bend Our necks beneath the yoke  And suffer fraud to talk us out of freedom  If we must yield before superior force  Let us at least deserve the name of men  Let us fall nobly if we are to fall  And give the world in characters of blood  Eternal causes to lament our fate  But never one occasion to despise us  GRANVILLE  Far from my bosom be the abject thought  To stoop the servile minister of greatness  Or crouch the advocate for lawless pow'r  The heir myself of heav'ndescended freedom  I wish the same bright heritage to all  And inly scorn a brotherhood with slaves  Yet sure some form your government must know  The reins of state must somewhere be devolv'd  And he who holds them name him as you please  Must be your prince and you must be his subjects  Why then if Lewis solemnly shall swear  To hold your rights inviolably sacred  Still to maintain the spirit of your laws  And never know another line of action  Why should you turn indignantly away  And slight the offer of a mighty monarch  Who knows that form of government is best  Which best secures the welfare of the people  ANSELMO  Because your monarch in this very offer  Seeks to subvert our glorious constitution  Seeks to erect hereditary rule  Where virtue only gives superior rank  And where the genius of descended Rome  Has levell'd all distinctions but in goodness  What is his promise to maintain us free  Sir we'll maintain that freedom for ourselves  And to maintain it we reject your master  The pow'r so safe in his benignant hand  Is safer still retain'd within our own  We know the worth of liberty too well  Ever to cast the blessing basely from us  Or still more basely to survive our honour  GRANVILLE  You need not cast the mighty blessing from you  The king my master wishes for no more  Than such mere title to the realms of Venice  As to his subjects and the world may warrant  A warm exertion of continual care  For this his dear allyAnd mark my lord  shewing a paper  The moment Venice owns him for her sovereign  This instrument confirms the viceroy's office  With all the active rule to great Anselmo  And his heirs for ever  ANSELMO  Am I awake  Or can I trust my reasonPatiencePatience  Are all the bright atchievements of my life  Unable now to save me from disgrace  Thus to the winds I give the vile proposal  tearing the paper  Thus tear the record of imputed shame  Nor let succeeding ages be inform'd  That mortal man has dar'd to doubt my honour  GRANVILLE  No more my lord my king I see has err'd  In off'ring peace and happiness to Venice  Yet let me mourn for you her wretched race  Her slaughter'd sons and violated virgins  For you her shrieking matrons and for you  O ye unconscious wnoffending babes  Driv'n from your humble yet your chearful homes  To timeless graves or everlasting exile  Anselmo dooms you to this dreadful fate  And spurns the friendship offer'd to preserve you  ANSELMO  Eternal curses on the baleful friendship  That seeks to cheat us of our native justice  And did your mean your poorlythinking prince  Suppose Anselmo would betray his country  Hang up his name to everlasting scorn  And sell the brightest birthright of a people  To gain a robber's portion of the plunder  What cou'd repay me for internal peace  Or give distinction where I sold my honour  The wildest prodigal the world can know  Is he who madly casts away his virtue  And tho' he gains a sceptre in return  He's still a wretched loser by the change  GRANVILLE  Enough my lord we end our conf'rence here  Venice 'tis true admires the good Anselmo  And trusts her present safety to his wisdom  Yet if his fellowcitizens shall hear  How light their happiness is held when weigh'd  In glory's grand tho' too romantic scale  Well may they mourn this honourable madness  This dread thro' bright delirium of the mind  Which seeks for safety in assur'd destruction  And blindly murders nations to preserve them  ANSELMO  Whene'er they shew such turpitude of soul  Make them again an offer of your chains  But now the purport of your business o'er  And public character thrown wholly off  In the plain province of a private man  Let me salute the noble lord of Granville  And beg while Venice boasts of such a guest  He'll not disdain the dwelling of Anselmo  GRANVILLE  My lord with equal gratitude and pleasure  I meet your kindness for my little stay  My scarce furl'd sails must quickly court the wind  And bear me back to my expecting master  ANSELMO  Th' assembled senate now requires my presence  My lord farewellI treat you as a friend  I never dealt in ceremony yet and you'll excuse  Th' unpolish'd manners of Venetian sailors  GRANVILLE  The gen'rous frankness of your temper here  Bespeaks a native honesty and wisdom  That makes me doubly anxious for the state  And doubly mourn your harsh reply to Lewis  ANSELMO  Mourn not for us my lorda freeborn people  Can have but two bright objects of ambition  A life of honour or a death of glory  And when for virtuous liberty they fall  They share at least the second greatest blessing  Which heav'n e'er pour'd in mercy on mankind  Exit  GRANVILLE  alone  How I admire his fortitude of soul  And love his pride tho' adverse to my wishes  Once my own bosom vehemently flam'd  With all the phrenzy of his noble zeal  And look'd on death more eligible far  Than ev'n a government of certain bliss  Beneath the reign of any foreign ruler  But I now wake from all this glitt'ring dream  Of fancied virtue and ideal honour  My Clementinal  Enter  CLEMENTINA  CLEMENTINA  My longlost Rinaldo  'Tis he'tis he and Elizara err'd not  The grave has giv'n him backAllseeing heaven  In kind compassion to a wife's despair  By some benignant miracle has rais'd him  And these transported arms again enfold  The best belov'd the most deptor'd of husbands  GRANVILLE  My life's great bliss here let me grow for ever  CLEMENTINA  It is too muchI shall run wild with rapture  How are you sav'd and wherefore thus disguis'd  Yet do not answerpartly Elizara  Has told me of your viewsand 'tis enough  I see you safeThat providence be prais'd  Whose mercy sent you at an hour of dread  To snatch me from destruction  GRANVILLE  O my love  I cannot tell you half of what I feel  Words are too poorYet say my chiefest good  Say do you love with such transcendent truth  That if the kindness of indulging fate  Shou'd point out ways of flying with Rinaldo  To some secure some hospitable coast  Alike propitious to our peace and fortune  Wou'd Clementina wou'd a wife prefer  The fond the ardent bosom of a husband  To the stern mansion of a ruthless father  CLEMENTINA  Wou'd she preferO quickly let him lead her  Thro' dreary wastes and nevertrodden wilds  Where heat cold famine in their dread extremes  At each new footstep strike an added horror  Thro' the noonblaze of fierce autumnal suns  O'er burning desarts instantly conduct her  Or where the stiff'ning nations of the night  In more than winter freeze beneath the pole  Thro' these bear off your faithful Clementina  And tho' a filial anguish drowns her eye  At what her poor her rev'rend father feels  O never question if she loves Rinaldo  GRANVILLE  Thus let me press you to my grateful bosom  Thus speak the raptures of my swelling heart  CLEMENTINA  O I have much to tell you of my sorrows  But what are sorrows nowThe gracious being  Who from a precipice of guilt and woe  In this dread crisis snatch'd me by your hand  O'erpays me tenfold for my past afflictions  And all my tears were ministers of joy  Exeunt  ACT III  ANSELMO'  S Palace Enter  ANSELMO  with a Paper and  ADORNO  ANSELMO  FROM Ferdinand himself  ADORNO  From Ferdinand  ANSELMO  From him AdornoBut observe his words  "Touch'd with the various miseries of Venice  The first of Europe's kings salutes the senate  And offers peace nay friendship to their realms  Peace uncondition'd and eternal friendship"  ADORNO  What has the royal ruffian been inform'd  That France has sued us to become her subject  And does he fearful of our base assent  Fearful his rival shou'd obtain our homage  Give up his own despotic claim upon us  And rather choose to set us wholly free  Than see his foe acknowledg'd for our master  ANSELMO  Too plainPerdition on his recreant head  His motive may be seenToo plain his fears  Wou'd now usurp the guise of highsoul'd virtue  But tho' we know the source of this proposal  Tho' we are certain

ANSELMO  How  PALERMO  Doats on another  ANSELMO  Beware Palermo this capricious temper  Doubt seldom lodges in a noble mind  And he scarce merits to be treated justly  Whose jealous soul on light foundation questions  Th' unsullied lustre of another's virtue  Retract then quick this hasty accusation  And kindly say my hapless child is dead  But dare not once to tell me she is worthless  PALERMO  On light foundation did I doubt my lord  This sharp reproach had been indeed deserv'd  But if incessant coldness if contempt  If open insult for protesting love  And ev'n a noonday fondness for a stranger  Are honest grounds of rational suspicion  Then have I cause for rage and indignation  ANSELMO  By heav'n 'tis false nor shall my child be wrong'd  By any coinage of a dotar  's madness  Her soul superior to the sland'rous charge  Has prov'd its worth to more than Roman greatness  And if she meant not to accept your vows  Her senseher prideher virtue had repuls'd them  Fond of a strangerTell me Sirwhat stranger  What mighty object has alarm'd your fears  And kindled hell's most fiercely blazing fire  The fire of groundless jealousy within you  PALERMO  Why will Anselmo treat me with contempt  And wound the wounded with the darts of scorn  Think you I rave or that my restless brain  Ingenious seeks out sources of misfortune  But what if hid within yon secret arbour  You shou'd yourself detect themwhat if there  You knew them long conceal'd What if you saw  Her alabaster arm as I have seen it  O damning sight thrown round the happy villain  Wou'd you not then with me conclude her lost  And think this ample evidence to prove  The plain perdition of her monstrous falshood  ANSELMO  And were you Sir like me a father  Like me a doating fatherhad your child  Thro' life maintain'd an unsuspected honour  And rose in virtue as she rose in beauty  Wou'd you believe at reason's full meridian  A maid thus pure thus eminently spotless  Cou'd plunge at once in infamy eternal  And set fame fortune happiness at nought  Thro' instant passion for a total stranger  PALERMO  My Lord I come not with an idiot's tale  Or wish Anselmo in an angry mood  Shou'd as an insant chide a thoughtless daughter  No I disdain the thoughtI come to guard  No less his honour than my ownto shew  Our mutual dangerand advise that Granville  May be this moment order'd to his France  As

again behold her as I have done  But that is set in one eternal night  And now my dream of happiness gives way  To sure disgrace and aggravated anguish  Ye fathers tear the feelings from your hearts  Ye mothers drag your infants from the breast  Dash them remorseless on their kindred flint  And kill the embryo savageness within them  They'll else blast all the comforts of your life  And viperlike

'Tis fate alone that marks me out for woe  And I shall never see Rinaldo more  ELIZARA  Persist not thus in unavailing grief  But praise the goodness that preserves your husband  Ev'n now the headstrong multitude enrag'd  At Granville's embassy to change the state  Throng round the palace and in thousands threat  A quick and public measure of revenge  Had he but stay'd another hour a moment  Perhaps Anselmo's ev'n your father's pow'r  Had been too weak tho' exercis'd to save him  CLEMENTINA  What does this do but aggravate my sorrows  But shew how curs'd how doubly curs'd my fate  My cruel fate has mercilessly made me  Conceal'd my husband falls a dreadful victim  To popular resentmentIf acknowledg'd  His country's justice leads him to the scaffold  And flying gracious and

crisis here  Will crown your truth with happiness at last  CLEMENTINA  Go talk of hope to wretches at the stake  To shrieking mothers o'er their insants dead  Go bid the murd'rer while his hands yet

fury down and blast those laws  Which talk of freedom yet enslave the mind  And boast of wisdom while they chain our reason  ANSELMO  Blaspheming monsterstop that impious tongue  Nor thus provoke me longer to commit  Some dreadful deed of honourable phrenzy  Already driv'n beyond a father's patience  I scarce can spare the very life I gave  Hence from my sight then execrable wretch  To urge me farther is to rush on death  And add new horrors to the fate of Granville  CLEMENTINA  Do strike at oncebehold my ready bosom  Yet spare Anselmo my unhappy husband  He is not what he seemsO Sirhe is  My brainmy brainWhen when shall I have rest  My father be consistently severe  Wreak not this cruel murder on my peace  And think that nature sanctifies my person  ANSELMO  He is not what he seemsDeclare who is he  How loss of truth attends the loss of honour  Abandon'd girl your arts are all in vain  Are all unable to prevent his fate  At my request th' assembling senate now  Prepare to hear his crime and will pronounce  His doom directlyNay this wretched tale  Shall ev'n give vengeance wingsaccelerate  His fall and like the dreadful whirlwind sweep  Him to destruction  Exit  CLEMENTINA  Stay Anselmo stay  He isbut that is also certain death  And I myself prepare the horrid axe  If I reveal himWhich way shall I act  The lab'ring globe convulsing to its base  Is downy softness to my mad'ning bosom  I'm all distractionReason drops her rein  And the next step is dreadful desperation  Exit  ACT V  Scene a Prison  Enter  GRANVILLE  in Chains  GRANVILLE  WHERE shall I turnthey have me now secure  Was I however singled out alone  To bear the utmost malice or the stars  I cou'd unshrinking look upon these chains  But when I think what Clementina suffers  When in the eye of agonizing fancy  I paint my wife all weltring in her blood  Or what more deeply damns me in reflection  Suppose her drag'd to hot Palermo's bed  My heart faints instantly with apprehension  And almost dies at bare imagination  Yet gracious fountain of unbounded mercy  Let one blest drop from your exhaustless source  In pity fall and save my Clementina  Save her O save her in the hour of peril  And teach the world that  CLEMENTINA  within  Hear me O Anselmo  I conjure you hear me  GRANVILLE  She's now in danger  The slaves now tear their victim to the altar  She is my wifeBarbarians

Apartment in  ANSELMO  's Palace  Enter  ANSELMO  and  PALERMO  ANSELMO  And yet my good Palermo  My secret soul inclines to hear her too  O did you mark her undissembled anguish  PALERMO  I didI didand felt it most severely  Her burning eye expanding into blood  Stood desperately fix'd while on each cheek  Each pallid cheek a single tear hung quiv'ring  Like early dewdrops on the sick'ning lily  And spoke a mind just verging into madness  ANSELMO  I'll see her once againfor when I weigh  All the nice strictness of her former conduct  When I reflect that to this cursed day  She look'd as if her person wholly mind  In Dian's breast cou'd raise a sigh of envy  I cannot think her utterly abandon'd  Abandon'd too in such a little space  Despise me not Palermofor the father  Still rushes strongly on my aching heart  And fondly seeks for argument to save her  PALERMO  Check not the tender sentiments of nature  But see hermake her if possible disclose  Who Granville truly is since she affirms  He is not what he seems and is her husband  That he's a Frenchman and of noble rank  Appears too plainly from his high commission  But still some secret strongly heaves her soul  And hid beneath this mystery of woe  Who knows how far that secret may not merit  Compassion or excuse  ANSELMO  I'll try at least  I'll act as fits the fondness of a father  Forgive as far as honour can forgive  And if her guilt exceeds a father's mercy  I'll beg of heaven the firmness of a man  Exit  PALERMO  Unhappy gen'rous excellent old man  I cou'd not quench his little ray of hope  And tell him all I thought of Clementina  She is indeed distrestBut pride alone  A disappointed pride and lawless love  Now harrow up her soulHad she an honest  Rational excusea tale that cou'd behold  The lightere now she had discover'd it  This seeming mystery is wholly art  To save this newmade husbandMonstrousmonstrous  Shame rises upon shame and each fresh guilt  Outdamns the former with its deep'ning blackness  Enter  GRANVILLE  bursting from the back Scene  GRANVILLE  I've forc'd a wayInfernal villain turn  Chain'd as I am you shall not fly me now  PALERMO  Why this exceeds my utmost expectation  This is revenge that pays an age of torture  Yes fraudful lord this meeting gives me transport  And long ere now my vengeance had you felt  But that the perjur'd partner of your crimes  Appear'd most guilty and to justice seem'd  Less the seduc'd than infamous seducer  GRANVILLE  Talk not of justice O consummate coward  Talk not of justice littleminded spoiler  When dead alike to sentiment and shame  You seek by forceby force inhuman ruffian  To drag a helpless woman to your bed  And tho' despis'ddetestedexecrated  Attempt assisted by her savage father  To make her yours thro' actual rape and murder  PALERMO  Ere I reply to this injurious charge  Let me tho' fate hangs o'er your guilty head  On equal terms allow you room to answer  Here I unloose your chainsNow hence with me  And fight the cause of this abandon'd woman  Palermo dares you forth to single combat  Palermo too shall arm his vanquish'd foe  Nor ev'n while Venice dooms him to the axe  Once name his crimes to shun the claims of honour  GRANVILLE  HenceWith the promis'd sword alone I'll answer  For tho' my soul thro' all her enmity  Feels a kind something for this gallant anger  In blood alone she'll speak her obligation  Exeunt  Scene changes to a Chamber  Enter  CLEMENTINA  CLEMENTINA  He'll see meendless blessings on his head  YesElizara's counsel was most just  There is no other way to save my husband  If I persist in hiding who he is  He dies beyond a doubtwhereas revealing  The fatal secret tho' replete with horror  May wake the father in Anselmo's bosom  And when he finds his daughter still unsullied  The sudden torrent of surprize and joy  May lead him yet to pity and forgiveness  Enter  ANSELMO  ANSELMO  I come at last unhappy girl to hear  If there's indeed in this mysterious conduct  Aught that can have pretensions to excuse  I come ev'n hoping ardently for motives  To justify an offer of my pardon  For O I wish I wish to find you guiltless  Speak then at once I earnestly conjure you  Give me but room to exercise my fondness  And come again securely to my heart  CLEMENTINA  O Sir restrain restrain this wond'rous goodness  It pierces like a dagger thro' my heart  And shews me doubly what a wretch I was  To wrong so good so excellent a father  Had I at first reveal'd my wretched story  Had I but said who Granville truly is  I see 'twere possible to hope for pity  ANSELMO  Deserve that pity and receive it now  Prove that you are not lostprove that this Granville  Is not the vile seducer of an instant  Shew me but thisand leave a partial father  If you can wipe away the charge of shame  To overlook the crime of disobedience  CLEMENTINA  How cou'd I be a monster so deprav'd  As once to forfeit tenderness like this  O Sirif you can graciously forgive  One faultone fatal faultwretch as I am  We may be happy yet and long long days  Of future joy o'erpay these hours of sorrow  Know then that Granville  ANSELMO  Well  CLEMENTINA  Is not of France  ANSELMO

wonderful events has since  Highrais'd him in the court of France and duty  To an indulgent to a royal master  Join'd with his wishes to behold your daughter  Has led him to this dang'rous embassy  O

hard at once  To conquer our resentmentsHard to take  Those to our hearts whom we have hated deadly  But 'tis such bliss to find you still unspotted  That what before had fir'd my soul to madness  Brings rapture now and cancels disobedience  CLEMENTINA  How shall I speak the feelings of my heart  How sacred Sir repay this wond'rous goodness  ANSELMO  I have a daughter stillRinaldo never  Was lost to worth tho' I abhorr'd his father  Nor shall his country for this first transgression  Forget the merit of his former service  Now you're my child againyour husband lives  Thus thus I bury your offence for ever  Embracing her  And fly to bring Rinaldo to your arms  Exit  CLEMENTINA  O teach me heaven O teach me to express  The strong sensations of my swelling bosom  Do not oppress me with this weight of mercy  And yet destroy my feeble pow'r to thank you  But my Rinaldo my deliver'd lord  Shall speak our mutual praiseJoy boundless joy  And gratitude absorb my little sense  Beyond the reach of recollectionand  Transport grows too exquisite for words  Enter  GRANVILLE  leaning on bis Sword pale and bloody entering he falls against the side of the Scene where be continues some time

me with all  And is he gone so soonO hapless girl  But yet Palermo's not to blameRinaldo  Provok'd his fateHe urg'd him to the combat  And the survivor conscious who has fall'n  Deplores most deeply the disast'rous blow  CLEMENTINA  Hence with his more than crocodile complaining  Hence to th' inferior monster of the Nile  Let him teach tears of yet unfancy'd falshood  There lies my husband slaughter'd by his hand  Heav'n's worst of woesHeav'n's worst of woes upon him  And thinks he now with founds of lamentation  To charm down griefs of magnitude like mine  No here I shake off wretchedness and life  Here I attend my dear Rinaldo's spirit  And leave the world to beings like Palermo  Stabs herself  ANSELMO  O ClementinaO my childmy child  Had you no pity for a weeping father  Was I not curs'd enough enough a wretch  Without this blow to rend my breast asunder  CLEMENTINA  I scarce know what I actmy reason totters  Yet while an interval of sense remains  O see me Sir with

only ask that this unhappy story  To future times may forcibly point out  The dire effects of filial disobedience  Exit  THE END  EPILOGUE  By GEORGE COLMAN  Esq  Spoken by Mrs YATES  FROM Otway's and immortal  Shakespeare  's page  Venice  is grown samiliar to our stage  Here the  Rialto  often has display'd  At once a bridge a street and mart of trade  Here treason threat'ning to lay  Venice  flat  Grave candlesnuffers oft in Senate sat  Tonight in  Venice  we have plac'd our scene  Where I have beenliv'ddiedas you have seen  Yet that my travels I may not disgrace  Let mesince now reviv'ddescribe the place  Nor wou'd the Tour of  Europe  prove our shame  Cou'd every  Macaroni  do the same  The City's selfa wonder all agree  Appears to spring like  Venus  from the sea  Founded on piles it rises from the strand  Like Trifle plac'd upon a silver stand  While many a lesser isle the prospect crowns  Looking like sugar plums or floating towns  Horses and mules ne'er pace the narrow street  Where crouded walkers elbow all they meet  No carts and coaches o'er the pavement clatter  Ladies Priests Lawyers Noblesgo by water  Light boats and gondolas transport them all  Like one eternal party to  Vauxhall  Now hey for merrimenthence gries and sear  The jolly Carnival leads in the year  Calls the young Loves and Pleasures to its aid  A threemonths jubilee and masquerade  With gaiety the throng'd piazza glows  Mountebanks jugglers boxers puppetshows  Mask'd and disguis'd the ladies meet their sparks  While  Venus  bails the mummers of  St Mark's  There holy friars turn gallants and there too  Nuns yield to all the frailties"Flesh is heir to"  There dear Ridottos constantly delight  And sweet Harmonic Meetings ev'ry night  Once in each year the  Doge  ascends his barge  Fine as a  London  Mayor's and thrice as large  Throws a huge ring of gold into the sea  And cries"Thus We thy Sov'reign marry thee  Oh may'st thou ne'er like many a mortal spouse  Prove full of storms and faitbless to thy vows"  One word of politicsand then Pve done  The state of  Venice  Nobles rule alone  Thrice happy  Britain  where with equal band  Three well pois'd states unite to rule the land  Thus in the theatre as well as state  Three ranks must join to make us bless'd and great  King Lords and Commons o'er the nation sit  Pit Box and Gallery rule the realms of wit
