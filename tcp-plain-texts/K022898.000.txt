 OBSERVATIONS ON THE  WESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND  RELATIVE CHIEFLY TO PICTURESQUE BEAUTY  TO WHICH ARE ADDED  A FEW REMARKS ON THE PICTURESQUE BEAUTIES OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT  BY WILLIAM GILPIN M A PREBENDARY OF SALISBURY AND VICAR OF BOLDRE IN NEW FOREST NEAR LYMINGTON  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL JUN AND W DAVIES STRAND    TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY ADDINGTON SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS  DEAR SIR  THOUGH your inquiries and pur∣suits have always been of a much higher nature than the subject of these papers yet I take the liberty of pre∣senting them to you as I am persuaded you do not disapprove in others what the rigid economy of your own time will not suffer you to pursue with much attention yourself  My book would gladly however still offer itself to your notice from some little personal affinity It de∣scribes a country through which you  have often travelled and in which your property chiefly lies  But if this plea have less weight it hath one more from whieh it hath a better hope of procuring a favourable reception The profits of it are in∣tended to lay the foundation of a little fund which you my dear Sir and a few other kind friends have obligingly engaged to countenance at some future period  As to the book itself it has lain by me these twenty years in which time it ought to have gainedand I hope it has gainedsome little advantage One advantage is that I have had op∣portunities of adorning several of the scenes it describes with contrasts taken from other countries which have oc∣casionally fallen in my way It was always a particular amusement to my∣self  and I hope it may be also to others to see how  variously  Nature works up the  same modes  of scenery in different parts of the world  At the same time so long a date hath occasioned some little anachronisms I met with a few improvements in differ∣ent places of later date than the body of the work itself These indeed I might have inserted in notes but I thought the occasion did not require much chronological exactness and therefore blended them with the text  After all my dear Sir to tell you the plain truth in my address to you I consider my book only as a vehicle The fact is I had the vanity to wish it known that I could call one of the most amiable and respectable men I am acquainted with my friend and I hope you will excuse my not commu∣nicating  to you this piece of vanity as I had determined to indulge what I feared you might wish to repress  I beg dear Sir you will believe me to be with the truest esteem respect and affection  Your most obedient and obliged

and sumptuous gardens of Nonsuch where Henry VIII and Elizabeth held their royal revelries cannot now be traced except here and there in the form of a canal or a terrace Impressions made upon the  ground itself  are commonly more lasting than any of the  works of art  which are con∣structed on its surface They are generally more enormous and the materials of no value Thus we have numberless tumuliintrench∣ments moundsand ditches of Roman and Saxon construction which will probably see as many ages as they have already seen while  the architectural remains of those nations are either gone or falling fast into ruin The ruin however of Nonsuch had an earlier date than happens to most great houses The pru∣dent foresight of the duchess of Cleveland to whom Charles II presented it was the cause of its speedy dissolution She feared a re∣sumption and pulling it in pieces sold the materials It is somewhat remarkable that her father Lord Francis Villiers one of the hand∣somest men of his time was killed in the pre∣ceding reign in a skirmish with a party of Cromwell's forces on this very spot  But though the building of Nonsuch was splendid and the gardens sumptuous beyond any of the royal houses of that time the situ∣ation has little merit At this day a situ∣ation is generally the first point attended to as indeed it ought in building a grand house but formerly the very worst situations seem to have been chosen as if on purpose to shew the tri∣umphs of art over nature Indeed our an∣cestors had little taste for the beauties of na∣ture but conceived beauty to reside chiefly in the expensive conceits and extravagances of art in which this palace particularly abounded The body of the edifice formerly stood in a  field across the road opposite to a little farm now known by the name of the  Cherrygar∣den  If it had been carried a quarter of a mile higher where a detached building appendant upon it called the  banquetingroom  formerly stood its situation would have been much bet∣ter It might have commanded a view over a country which is in some parts pleasing  Of the numerous appendages of this sump∣tuous pile nothing remains but a house now modernized which is said to have been formerly the habitation of Queen Elizabeth's maids of honour In the garden was a large chalkpit containing about an acre of ground which has been planted and formed into a pleasing little sequestered scene by Mr Whately late secre∣tary to the treasury who wrote  Observations on Modern Gardening  His brother now possesses that estate which was formerly the demesne of the palace  From Nonsuch we pass through Ewel to Epsom Ewel is chiefly remarkable for a co∣pious spring of limpid water which arising in several parts of the village forms itself into a  considerable stream The baths collected from it are chill and pure in a great degree Ep∣som hath been described by the pen of Toland who exercised the powers of a wan∣ton imagination with more innocence on this subject than on many others All that can now be said of it with truth and it is  now  much improved since the days of Toland is that it is a large pleasant village built in the form of a crescent in an open country and that it contains a few elegant houses Of these the most remarkable is a house belonging to the late Lord Baltimore though it is now neglected and the park thrown into farms  The chief recommendation of Epsom is its situation on the skirts of that open country called Bansteaddowns celebrated for hunting racing cricketmatches and mutton These downs consist of beautiful sweeps of intersecting grounds disfigured indeed here and there by a chalky soil but adorned with rich and very picturesque distances  On these downs stands a huntingseat of Lord Derby's called the  Oaks  which that no∣bleman  brought into repute for it was for∣merly an inn by a very expensive summerevening entertainment which he gave upon his marriage General Burgoyne celebrated both the place and the occasion in a small dramatic piece called the  Maid of the Oaks  Though this little villa is whimsical and sin∣gular it has its beauty It commands about twenty acres in an oblong form In the cen∣tre stands the house which is a kind of tower but yet unfinished One half of the ground is laid out in close walks winding among  oaks  from whence the place has its name the other is a hanging lawn interspersed with fir flow∣ering shrubs and beeches The oaks are or∣dinary and the firs scarcely yet halfgrown but some of the beeches are of the grandest form The whole is surrounded by a sunk fence and like an inchanted island in a desert appears a beautiful spot from every part of the downs in its neighbourhood and has itself a grand view over them as far as the towers of London  From Epsom we proceeded to Leatherhead skirting Lord Suffolk's park at Ashted which  is a pleasant scene including a great variety of ground and some fine oaks and elms within a walled circumference of about two miles The house is not grand but compact and com∣fortable  The house is now rebuilt Sir Robert Howard in Charles the Second's time was the architect of the old house which I thought having often seen it a very good one    SECT II  AT Leatherhead instead of continuing along the great road to Guilford we turned short on the left to take a view of Mr Lock's house at Norburypark which stands about halfway between that town and Dork∣ing on the banks of the Mole Nothing in these parts is so well worth a traveller's at∣tention  The beauties of the Mole itself deserve but little commendation It is a lazy stream and sinking into the ground in some places leaves its channel dry in droughty seasons Its banks however are beautiful in various parts but in no part more so than where Mr Lock's woods and lawns rise loftily above them  On entering the gate from the road and pass∣ing the Mole we wind round the hill on the right towards the house which stands on the  summit removed from the sight as we ap∣proach it though from various parts of the country it is a conspicuous object  Among other wood which adorns this as∣cent is a profusion of box This plant grows here in full luxuriance in its native unculti∣vated state marking the road on the right with great beauty A regular clipt boxwood hedge is an object of deformity but growing wildly as it does here and winding irregu∣larly at different distances along the road it is very ornamental The box itself also is a pleasing object in winter it harmonizes with the ground and in summer with the woods which surround it Box has a mellower a more varied and a more accommodating tint than any evergreen One other circumstance of advantage attends it Almost every species of shrub in a few years outgrows its beauty If the knife be not freely and frequently used it becomes bare at the bottom its branches dispart and it rambles into a form too diffuse for its station But boxwood long preserves its shape and in the wild state in which we found it here is far from regular though its branches which are never large are close  and compact I should however mention holly as having all the picturesque qualities of box except the variety of its tints But in the room of these it throws out its beautiful clusters of coral berries which have a pleasing effect among its dark green polished leaves Like box it grows slowly and alters leisurely  After winding about a mile up the hill we arrive at the house which is encircled with groves of lofty fullgrown beech The  backfront  if I may be allowed an awk∣ward expression for want of a better over∣hangs the steep part of the hill and com∣mands as you survey it from the windows of the house a very grand vale not like the winding rocky vales of a mountainous coun∣try but such as we sometimes find though rarely on so ample a scale among the downy hills of a chalky soil though here the chalk rarely offends This vale is a flat area of cul∣tivated ground about five or six miles in length and one in breadth Sometimes in∣deed though but rarely it takes the form of a lake or bay of the sea which it exactly resem∣bles when it happens to be overspread by a thick white fog such a fog as from its gravity  and the want of air to disturb it sinks to a level like water and like water also describes the prominences of the vale around the bases of the hills  Generally indeed these heavy fogs are mis∣chievous when they float over seamarshes and other moist lands A gentleman once fitted up a house near the coast of Suffolk which was often subject to them It stood on a small eminence in the midst of a rich woody vale the whole surrounded by hills Here the fogs would sometimes appear in an au∣tumnal evening winding along the vale like a river and sometimes like a lake not with that indistinct and vapourish surface which fogs commonly assume but flat clear and trans∣parent forming distinctly all those little in∣dentations which a waterline would have de∣scribed These beautiful exhibitions though frequently presented never failed to please In the mean time the family were all seized with agues fevers and bilious disorders and in three years found out that these beautiful fogs were the cause of their complaints When the master of the scene therefore had just gotten his house and grounds completed he was constrained to leave them  Norbury park however is not subject to this beautiful mischief It is but rarely that its vale is thus filled with a sleeping fog and when it is the house stands so proudly above it that it despises its bad effects  The sidescreen of this vale on the right as you still survey it from the windows consists of a downy hill marked with various large ir∣regular channels and planted with ancient oak and beech Through these woods a walk is conducted along its sloping side from whence you have descending views into the vale be∣low some of which seen through the spread∣ing arms of an oak or a beech as through the frame of a picture have a pleasing effect  The other sidescreen of the vale consists of that boast of Surrey the celebrated Boxhill so called from the profusion of box which flourishes spontaneously upon it This hill from its downy back and precipitous sides ex∣hibits great variety of pleasing views into the lower parts of Surrey and the higher parts of the neighbouring counties But we have here only to do with it as itself an object in a retir∣ing scene in which it fills its station with great beauty discovering its shivering preci∣pices and downy hillocks every where inter∣spersed  with the mellow verdure of box which is here and there tinged as box commonly is with red and orange  This hill and the neighbouring hills on which this beautiful plant flourishes in such profusion should be considered as making a part of the natural history of Britain Asser in his Life of Alfred the Great tells us that Berkshire had its name from a wood  ubi buxus abundantissimè nascitur  No trace of any such wood now remains nor is there perhaps a single bush of indigenous box to be found in the whole country All has been rooted up by the plough If it were not therefore for the growth of box on the Surrey hills whose precipitous sides refuse cultivation it might perhaps be doubted whether box were a na∣tive of England As to the common tradition of the country that it was planted by an earl of Arundel it is certainly fabulous for there are court rolls still existing which mention  the boxwood on the hill  before any such artificial plantation could have taken place  Insignificant as this shrub appears it has been to its owner Sir Henry Mildmay a source of considerable profit It is used chiefly in turning But the ships from the Levant brought such quantities of it in ballast that the wood on the hill could not find a purchaser and not having been cut in years was growing in many parts cankered But the war having diminished the in∣flux of it from the Mediterranean several purchasers began to offer and in the year Sir Henry put it up to auction and sold it for the immense sum of twelve thousand pounds Box at∣tains its full growth in about fifty years in which time if the soil be good it will rise fifteen feet and form a stem of the thick∣ness of a man's thigh The depredations made on Box hill in consequence of this sale will not much injure its picturesque beauty as it will be twelve years in cutting which will give each portion a reasonable time to renew its beauty    The endscreen which shuts in the beautiful vale just described consists of the range of hills beyond Dorking and the rising grounds of Deepden where in a clear day a new house built by the Duke of Norfolk makes a con∣spicuous object A little to the left of Dork∣ing hills the high grounds gradually falling admit a distant catch of the South downs which overhang the sea  Such is the situation of this elegant villa though like all other situations it hath its fa∣vourable and unfavourable lights It is seen to most advantage in an evening As the vale points almost directly south from the house the west is on the right In the evening therefore the woods of that screen are all in  shadow which is flung in one vast mass over the bosom of the vale while the setting sun having just touched the tops of the trees as its rays pass over throws a beautiful light on the guttered sides of Boxhill  This view over the vale beautiful as it is is subject however to inconvenience Every house should if possible overlook its  own do∣mains  as far at least as to remote distance All the intermediate space in which objects are seen more distinctly may suffer great injury from the caprice of different proprietors and in fact this view has in two or three instances suffered injury from the interference of neigh∣bours This is indeed one reason among others why noble palaces with extensive pro∣perty on every side are most adapted to these commanding situations  Norburyhouse pretends only to comfort and convenience except in the drawing room which is an object of great curiosity It is an oblong of feet by The walls are co∣vered with a hard and durable stucco and are painted by Barret The whole room repre∣sents a bower or arbour admitting a  fictitious  sky through a large oval at the top and co∣vered at the angles with trelliswork inter∣woven with honeysuckles vines clustering grapes and flowering creepers of various kinds The sides of the room are divided by slight painted pilasters appearing to support the trel∣lis roof and open to four views That to∣wards the  south  is  real  consisting of the vale inclosed by Boxhill and the hills of Norbury and Dorking which hath been just described The other three are  artificial  Two of them which are the two endviews cover the whole sides of the room from the ceiling to the base  The scene presented on the  west  wall is taken from the lakes of Cumberland It is an exact portrait of none of them but a land∣scape formed from a collection of some of the happiest circumstances which belong to all No real view could present so beautiful and complete a picture A large portion of the lake under a splendid calm is spread before the eye surrounded by mountains perfectly well shaped and stationed Nature is not very nice in the moulds in which she commonly casts these enormous bodies and as they have  various forms of beauty so have they of de∣formity but here we have some of the most pleasing shapes culled out and beautifully grouped Woods are scattered about every part which give these scenes a greater richness than nature hath given to any of the lakes in Cumberland The smaller ornaments also of buildings figures and boats are judiciously introduced and have a good effect All this scenery is contained in various removes of dis∣tance for no part of the lake comes close to the eye The near ground is composed of bold rocks and other rough surfaces with which the banks of lakes commonly abound Among these a wild torrent variously broken pours its waters under the surbase of the room which intercepts it This torrent the painter has managed so well that its spirit and brilliancy produce no lights which interfere with the calm resplendency of the lake but rather con∣trast it  In describing this noble landscape I have thus far considered it chiefly as a  whole  But all its  parts  are equally excellent On the fore∣ground particularly are two birchtrees which are painted with great beauty The roots the bark and the foliage are all admirable  The other grand landscape occupies the  east∣ern  wall of the room It is I think inferior to that on the  west  yet it is a noble work The scene is sylvan and the objects of course less grand The foreground where we admire particularly some beautiful trees is tumbled about in various forms but in the distance it sinks into a rich flat country through which a sluggish stream winding its course dis∣charges itself into the sea The same observ∣ations might be made on this picture which were made on the other with regard to com∣position and the judicious management of the several parts  The  north  side of the room opposite to the windows offers two more landscapes divided by the breast of the chimney which is adorned with a pierglass let into the wall and covered thick with a framework of ho∣neysuckles vines wildroses and various creepers in flower all painted with great beauty These two pictures on the  north  are a continuation of the scene exhibited on the western wall which they unite with the land∣scape on the  east  Clustering vines and wild flowers form a framework to all these beauti∣ful pictures both at the base and along the  trelliswork of the sides so as to give them the resemblance of being seen through the openings of the arbour  With this  unity in the subjects  of these land∣scapes the  light  also and other  particulars  co∣incide The  season  represented is autumn Every where round the room the year is in its wane Each tree and bush is touched with its autumnal hue The  time of the day  is about an hour before the sun sets which after a rainy afternoon is breaking out from the wa∣tery clouds that are scattered before a gentle breeze in too high a region of the air to affect the surface of the lake The rainy clouds which are broken in the  west  hang heavy in the north and give a dark lurid tint to the lake below In the  northeast angle  a ray of sunshine breaking through the gloom gilds a castled cliff but the clouds condensing again fall in a heavy though a partial shower on the landscape in the east  As the sun is represented setting on the  west∣ern  side of the room it is  supposed  to illumine the several objects in  all  the pictures and when the  natural hour  corresponds with the  hour represented  there is a coincidence of  arti∣ficial  and  natural  light All the landscape  both within and without the room appears illumined by the same sun The union too between the  natural  and  artificial  landscape is still farther assisted by a few straggling trees which are planted before the windows with a view to connect the picture with the  country  We dwell the longer on this curious and in∣teresting room as it is the only one of the kind perhaps in England There is a room painted by the celebrated Gasper Poussin at the villa of Monte Dragone near Rome on a plan some∣thing like this but Gasper has paid no atten∣tion to the union of the several  lights  nor to the  characteristic agreement  of the several views  Added to the house is another grand room full of much curiosity It was built by Mr Lock as a painting room for the amusement of his eldest son whose genius taste and know∣ledge in painting contend with our best artists This room is adorned with a rich collection of statues models casts and basreliefs all ex∣cellent in their kind and an adjoining closet is filled with heads hands feet trunks and other parts of the human body so that the whole together is a complete study for a painter  Among the casts is a very fine one of the Venus of Medici It is not common to see so  good a substitute of this figure I have some∣times heard her  attitude  called in question In∣stead of that modest demeanor which is com∣monly ascribed to her I have known her re∣proached for prudery and theatrical affecta∣tion We can in truth say but little for her moral character Her  attitude  however I think may be defended The sculptor I sup∣pose meant her to be viewed with her face to∣wards you In that position she makes the most elegant figure  Shrunk from herself  With fancy blushing  she received the shot of the prophane eye that surprised her as our modern heroes in duel∣ling receive a bullet by instantly drawing her body into a profile In both cases nature teaches the easiest and most commodious pos∣ture  But this collection though it consist chiefly of casts contains some genuine antiques par∣ticularly a Discobolus which is esteemed I be∣lieve the first statue in England It turns on a pivot and exhibits what few statues are able to exhibit  on every side  the justest propor∣tions and the most pleasing attitudes But  what chiefly engages the attention in this sta∣tue is its  expression  It is a great beauty in any figure to appear to have some object in view which always gives animation to it I mean not that strong degree of action which the ancient masters sometimes gave their figures as in the Laocoon the fighting gladia∣tor and the Torso as far as we may judge of that fragment from the swelling of the muscles  Strong expression  no doubt is highly beautiful when it is well executed But I would here only observe the effect of some  easy action  or  expression  in opposition to  none at all  as in the Venus the Belvidere Apollo the lis∣tening Slave or the Farnesian Hercules rest∣ing from one of his labours All these gentle modes of  action  or  expression  are certainly much more beautiful than the uninteresting vacancy of a consul standing erect in his robes Interesting he still may be all I contend for is that such a statue is not  so  interesting as if it had some object in view The Discobolus be∣fore us possesses this beauty in a distinguished manner He has just delivered his quoit and with an eager eye and right arm still ex∣tended is watching its success The expanded hand indicates that the mind is yet in sus∣pence  The right hand in this statue is modern but there is a repetition of this figure in the Musaeum Clementinum at Rome which shews I am informed the hand to have been well copied  His left hand holds another quoit as I suppose each Discobolus had two It is pro∣bable however the statuary might have dis∣posed the left hand to more advantage if he could have described a quoit flying through the air But he thought it necessary in some way to shew in what mode of action his figure was engaged Nature could not have told the story with more expression  This statue is now in the hands of Mr Duncombe of Yorkshire who purchased it of Mr Lock    As the statuary has generally a single figure only to manage there is much artifice necessary to shew who he is or if he be employed what he is about and sometimes this is done very awkwardly We might produce many instances but few perhaps more remarkable than M Angelo's celebrated statue of Moses Unless the original greatly exceed any of the copies we have of it it certainly deserves less praise than it has found The face is incum∣bered with beard and the body with drapery But what I mean to remark at present is the conceit with which the statuary has  charac∣terized  Moses Some symbol was necessary to distinguish him from a Roman consul sitting in his curule chair M Angelo has given him  horns  by which he has turned him into a satyr From whatever silly conceit the  idea  of giving horns to the great Jewish lawgiver originally sprang it is certainly absurd in the last degree to see that  idea realized in marble  How much better might Moses have been cha∣racterized simply by his  rod  and the  two tables of the covenant  which latter well managed might have made a broad contrast with the drapery while in part they might have been covered with it  Among so many copies from the antique it is difficult to forbear remarking that the hair in some of them is very awkwardly expressed I have the Laocoon particularly in view The hair and beard of this statue have an uncom∣monly bad effect for as the face is turned from the eye the locks of hair which are in round curls are confounded with the features themselves presenting a number of small cavi∣ties whose dark shadows diminish the effect of those in the nostrils mouth and eyes which should give character and expression to the face It is a difficult thing no doubt to give  the ease of hair to a block of marble yet it may be done in two ways We have exam∣ples of both The hair may be represented very short just covering the head approach∣ing nearly to baldness as we often see it ex∣pressed or it may be represented in an easy flow This is more difficult yet we some∣times see it well executed and when it is so it is certainly more beautiful than to express the hair in small ringlets as it is in the Lao∣coon and in many other antiques  Before we leave this room I cannot forbear mentioning a head which has a place there with hair of another kind It plainly indeed appeared allied neither to the Greek nor Ro∣man models among which it stood for the mouth was frightfully bad yet the  upper part  of the face was executed with simplicity and had something in it like taste and beauty On inquiry we found it was a great curiosity being the workmanship of a native of Otaheite and seemed a convincing proof that a love for the imitative arts is innate But what particularly struck us in this head was its being adorned with  real hair  which had a still worse effect than the beard of Laocoon The mixture in∣deed of  reality  and  imitation  is very disgusting  and I doubt not would have appeared so on a little more knowledge and experience to the ingenious sculptor of the head himself But we need not wonder at such absurdity in an artist of Otaheite when we see among our∣selves so many shocking statues  painted after the life  and vile waxen images with wigs and drapery things to shudder at rather than to admire The plain marble makes no pre∣tence to any thing but  imitation  It means not to put a  trick  upon us by substituting itself for  real life  But when we look at a waxen figure arrayed in  real drapery  yet with  rigid limbs  and  glazed  and  motionless eyes  that is with every appearance of life about it but mo∣tion in which the very essence of life consists we are shocked The fact is that when the  art of imitation  applied to human life is so perfect as to produce a  real  though  momentary illusion  it presents by its  near approach to life  an image of  death  For the instant we per∣ceive that a figure of this kind wants motion we pursue it to the next stage where motion ceases which is  death  A  representation of a dead body  may be beautiful and pleasing but a figure which presents you with the appear∣ance  of death when you expected life not only disgusts you by the suddenness of the tran∣sition but also from the mind's having been even for a moment imposed on by so paltry a trick  From such effects therefore it seems to fol∣low that an  art calculated to please by an imita∣tion of life  should when applied to the human figure though  necessarily imperfect  be made  intentionally  more so lest by too near an ap∣proach to  life  it should shock us with the idea of  death  Besides the shock which these represent∣ations give to the senses they grossly oppose every idea of taste When we see a stuffed skin in a Museum we expect only an object of curiosity and are satisfied But when a thing of this kind is shewn as an  object of beauty  it sets all taste which in natural objects seeks for nature at defiance and we consider a mummy which aims at nothing but what it is by many degrees the more respectable figure  As we leave this elegant mansion and descend the hill the views are more  picturesque  than those over the valley from the backfront They consist of oblique sweeps of descending  foregrounds every where wellwooded and set off with remote distances This is the  sim∣plest mode of landscape  but where the foreground and distances are good though there is a strong opposition between them they are not unpleasing  A little to the right as we descend from the house the beechwoods consisting of lofty fullgrown trees sweep down to the vale though in less luxuriance as they gradually descend When the descent becomes precipitous the channelled sides of the hill are in many parts bare of vegetation and discover the soil which is not chalk though of a chalky tendency and rather grey than white Patches of earth are mixed with these patches of barren soil in which boxwood grows profusely and here and there where the soil allows a luxuriant beech Down this hill an Alpine road winds into the vale and adds much to its beauty and character It is still rendered more inte∣resting by opening in various parts towards Boxhill which presents its flanks in these partial views with a very mountainlike ap∣pearance The whole scene makes a good Alpine picture  Our remarks on this place should have been more cursory if the plan of the whole the situation and the embellishments of it had not been all uncommon Great houses in general resemble each other so nearly that it is difficult to find among them any characteristic features Here the whole is new  SECT III  FROM Norburypark we returned to Lea∣therhead and passed the Mole again in our way to Guildford The country on the left consists chiefly of open downs which are ra∣ther narrow in this part as they are drawing to a point They are interspersed also with plots of cultivation As these downs are generally high we had from many parts of them a va∣riety of beautiful distances on the right not so expansive as those from Bansteaddowns but more picturesque as they are more within the command of the eye The great beauty of such scenes consists in the richness of their parts in the removal of one distance beyond another discoverable chiefly by lengthened gleams of light and in the melting of the whole into the horizon If a distance be de∣prived of  any  of these characteristics it is im∣perfect but the last is most essentially neces∣sary A  hard edge  of distance checking the view which is often the case when the dis∣tance is not remote is exceedingly disgusting  When the distance indeed is bounded by moun∣tains it falls under other rules of picturesque beauty  Of the elevated situation of these downs much advantage hath been taken Many ele∣gant houses are built upon the edge of them for the sake of the various prospects they com∣mand The whole country indeed from Lea∣therhead almost to Guildford is thus richly adorned Two of the most beautiful of these villas are those belonging to the late Admiral Boscawen and Lord Onslow The latter is esteemed one of the best houses in Surrey The grounds about it seem well disposed but we only rode past them  A little to the left near three parts of the way to Guildford we were directed to look out about half a mile from the road for a beautiful scene called the  Sheepleas  consisting of lawns divided from each other by woody copses We easily found it and were much gratified with the appearance it presented of a simple Arcadian retreat  Few parts of this adorned tract of country between Leatherhead and Guildford through a space of about eleven miles can be called pic∣turesque yet from the variety it affords it is  very amusing One of the great nuisances of the landscape here as well as in other parts of the neighbourhood of London is the formal manner which prevails of lopping trees espe∣cially elms They are entirely deprived of the beautiful ramification of all their lateral branches and you see them every where formed into mere poles with a bush at the top  We  considered them only as objects of deformity but the  skilful woodman  I have heard considers such mutilation as very detri∣mental to the timber One reason given for lopping the elm is that it may be the better converted into a hollow trunk to convey water under ground Elm is the wood chiefly used for this purpose as it continues long sound if it be kept from the air but perhaps not one in fifty of these mutilated trees is converted to this use  Guildford is a town both of antiquity and curiosity but is in no part picturesque It consists of one long street running down pre∣cipitately to the river Wey from whence the road on the other side rises still more ab∣ruptly  It has lately been much eased  In the highest part of the town stands the castle which consists of a heavy tower though in one or two points it is not unpicturesque The Wey is navigable as far as Guildford and beyond it for timber which is brought down the river from the contiguous parts of the country  Floats of timber are among the pleasing ap∣pendages of a river when the trunks are hap∣pily disposed This disposition however I fear must be the result of chance rather than of art It is hardly possible to pack a float pic∣turesquely by design These cumbrous ma∣chines are navigated each by a single man with a pole and as they glide gently down the stream the tremulous reflections they form on the still surface of the water and their contrast with trees bushes and pasturage as they float along are pleasing  But cumbrous as these rafts are they are as nothing compared with those which are often floated down the Rhine In the neighbourhood of Andernach great quantities of timber brought down by various streams from the forests of Germany are there constructed into  a float of vast dimensions Some of these floats are a thousand feet long and ninety broad and are each furnished with five hundred men For the accommodation of such a company a street of cabins is built upon the surface of the float When all is ready and the several men are at their posts many of whom are in rafts and boats both behind and before the float to conduct it properly the pilot stands up and taking off his hat with a loud voice cries out "Let us pray" on which the whole body of the workmen on board fall down on their knees and beg a blessing on the expedition The anchors and cables are then drawn on board and the whole machine is put in motion As it sails majestically down the Rhine it draws all the inhabitants from the towns and villages on the banks of the river to see it pass till it ar∣rive at Dort in Holland the place of its desti∣nation where being broken up the sale of its several parts continues many months and raises often the sum of thirty thousand pounds  See a longer account of these floats in a very ingenious and entertaining work intitled  A Journey through Holland c by Anne Ratcliffe    To these timber floats we may add one of a very singular kind on the Nile constructed of earthen vessels Large jars to preserve water  in dry seasons are in great request in many parts of Egypt These of various sizes are manufactured chiefly in the clayey grounds of the upper parts of the country When the potter has gotten a sufficient number ready for market he begins to form his float In some convenient place near the river he ranges his largest jars empty but wellcorked in rows of a proper length and breadth These he braces tight with flexible twigs and with the same art ranges above them several tiers of smaller jars till he has made up the quantity and kind of goods his market demands Over all he constructs a seat for himself By this time the waters of the Nile whose increase he calculates begin to ripple round his earthen raft which is presently after afloat Hav∣ing victualled it with a bag of parched rice and put on his blue linen shirt and cap he takes his seat and paddles his vessel into the middle of the channel The wondering stranger eyes from the shore this odd spe∣cies of navigation and though assisted by his pocketperspective cannot conceive its con∣struction In the mean time it glides down the stream Neither storms nor rocks it fears with which the Nile is little acquainted and if  it even touch the ground its motion is so gen∣tle and the ooze so soft that its construction is not in the least disturbed Nothing can be more ingenious than to make a cargo of heavy materials its own vehicle at the same time such a float could hardly be an object of beauty  The elegant author of the  Elegy in a Church∣yard  seems to have had a float of this kind in his view in the last lines of the following beau∣tiful description of the Nile  What wonder in the sultry climes that spread  Where Nile redundant o'er his summerbed  From his broad bosom life and verdure flings  And broods o'er Egypt with his watry wings  If with adventurous oar and ready sail  The dusky people drive before the gale  Or on  frail floats  to neighbouring cities ride  That rise and  glitter  o'er the ambient tide  From Guildford to Farnham the form of the country is singular The road is carried through the space of eight miles over a ridge of high ground with a steep descent on each side This grand natural terrace which the country people call the  Hog's back  presents on each hand extensive distances On the  right the distance is very remote consisting of that flat country through which the Wey the Mole and the Thames though none of them objects in the scene flow with almost imper∣ceptible motion On the left the distance is more broken with rising grounds interspersed through various parts of it  Though the distance on neither hand forms a picture except in a few places for want of foregrounds and proper appendages pro∣portioned to the scene yet on both sides we study a variety of those pleasing circumstances which we look for in remote landscape As we draw near the close of this terrace the two dis∣tances unite in one forming a kind of grand amphitheatre in front  Such violent contrasts as these in which lofty grounds break down  precipitately  into extensive plains are rather uncommon in nature as these different modes of country are generally more imperceptibly united We have several scenes however of this kind in different parts of Eng∣land particularly in the view over the vale of Mowbray  See Northern Tour vol ii p  and in that over the vale of Se∣vern  See the Wye p  in both which the union is abrupt  As England however is a country only on a small scale compared with the vast tracts on the continent its scenes are more in miniature Its rivers its lakes its mountains and plains though generally more picturesque as more suited to human vision yet do not strike the imagination with so much grandeur Many instances might be brought from the continent of sublimer effects in all modes of landscape A very abrupt transition from the most mag∣nificent sylvan scenery to entire sterility I met with lately in an account of the productions of Boutan and Thibet communicated in the Phi∣losophical Transactions  Vol lxxix  Where Boutan says the author of those remarks joins the territory of Thibet the boundary is marked by such a line as is perhaps hardly to be seen in any other part of the earth From the eminence where we stood the mountains of Boutan which ranged above us appeared every where beautifully arrayed in wood mantling down to our very feet This view was towards the south When we turned towards the north the eye is received by a vast dreary waste de∣scending far and wide composed of extensive  ranges of hills and plains but from the woody spot where we stood through the whole unbounded distance there is not the least ap∣pearance of vegetation  Farnham consists chiefly of one long tho∣roughfare street and is principally remarkable for its being the summerresidence of the Bishop of Winchester  Farnhamcastle stands high and was form∣erly a fortress of considerable reputation It was built by a Bishop of Winchester in the time of King Stephen when castles were much in fashion and made some figure in the trou∣bled reign of that prince It afterwards figured in the times of Lewis the Dauphin in the in∣surrections of the barons and in the civil wars of the last century During these last trou∣bles it was blown up by Sir William Waller though not with that  picturesque judgment  with which many castles in those times were demo∣lished Very little is left that can make a pleas∣ing picture After the restoration it deposited its military character and was changed again into an episcopal palace by Bishop Morley but it has ever since been neglected The pre∣sent  bishop is the first who has paid any atten∣tion for many generations to Farnhamcastle He has greatly improved the house and has fitted it up in such a manner as will probably make it an object to every future bishop The keep or inner castle is left standing in its ruins and is still a curious piece of antiquity It is surrounded by a deep ditch which toge∣ther with the area of the castle containing about two acres makes an excellent kitchengarden  Behind the house extends a park about four miles in circumference which the bishop found as much neglected and out of order as the house itself It was cut with unlicensed paths the trees were mangled to browze the deer and a cricket ground had so long been suffered that the people conceived they had now a right to it This last was a great nuisance Such a scene of riot and disorder with stands for selling liquor just under the castle windows could not easily be endured The bishop took the gentlest methods he could to remove the nuisance and at length though not without some difficulty got it effected  Having thus removed nuisances from his park he began to embellish it He improved  the surface he laid out handsome roads and walks he planted young trees and protected the old trees from farther ill usage  Across the park runs an avenue a mile long of ancient elms The bishop could not per∣suade himself to remove this monument of an∣tiquity and I think with great judgment hath left it in its old form for though an avenue is neither a pleasing nor a picturesque arrange∣ment of trees yet the grandeur of this gives it consequence and its connection with the an∣tiquity of the castle gives it harmony Here the poet after mourning the loss of other ave∣nues may exult  Ye fallen avenues once more I mourn  Your fate unmerited once more rejoice  That yet a remnant of your race survives  About a quarter of a mile from the house arises in the park an eminence on which stands a keeper's lodge The situation is conspicuous but the object unpleasing A few acres there∣fore around it are inclosed a greenhouse is built to skreen the lodge and walks are cut and adorned with different kinds of curious shrubs in high perfection  From this eminence are several openings into the country particularly one towards  Moorpark where that enlightened genius Sir William Temple retiring in disgust from state affairs when Charles II's politics received a tincture from France cultivated every part of literature with an elegance of taste uncommon at that day His heart lies buried according to his will in a silver urn under a dial in his garden A singularity of this kind in prefer∣ring a garden to a churchyard rather favours the opinion which Bishop Burnet gives us of Temple's religious sentiments  In most of the views from the park at Farn∣hamcastle Crooksburyhill is a distinguished feature which tradition says Sir William Temple always considered as one of the greatest ornaments of his place This shews his love for nature though in laying out his grounds the awkward idea of the times misled both his theory and practice  From the terrace before the castle the view is singular We overlooked the town of Farnham and a tract of country which may properly be called the  vale of hops  for we saw nothing but ranges of that plant which was now in full leaf and made a curious though very unpleasing appearance The hop and the vine in a  natural  state are among the  most picturesque plants Their shoots their tendrils their leaves their fruit are all beauti∣ful but in their cultured state they are perfect samples of regularity stiffness and uniformity which are of all ideas the most alien to every thing we wish in landscape  Nothing shews so much the prejudice of names as the value fixed on Farnham hops Those produced in this parish sell at Weyhill and all the great fairs at a considerably greater price than those which grow even in the next parish though divided only by a hedge To keep up this idea of excellence the Farnham farmers agree every year on a secret mark which they affix to all their own bags The value of the hops spread under our eye from the terrace on which we stood was supposed to be at least ten thousand pounds  SECT IV  FROM Farnham to Alton the road passes through pleasant lanes Holt Forest occu∣pying the left forms an agreeable woody ho∣rizon Sometimes it breaks the line and ad∣vances a little nearer the eye but it generally keeps the same distance and runs along the higher grounds through the space of several miles But though it is higher than the neigh∣bouring country it is itself a tract of level land We rode through it and were much pleased with its woods and lawns  In the midst of it stands a house which formerly belonged to Mr Bilson Legge A very extensive lawn is cleared before it inter∣spersed with combinations of trees and though it is a perfect flat yet the line of its woody boundary being varied and removed to differ∣ent distances by retiring woods the whole has a good effect which is not a little assisted by some handsome trees on the foregroundA flat if it be  very extensive  may convey a  grand  idea but when we have a  small piece  of  flat  ground to improve all we can do unless we vary its surface is to adorn it with wood Surrounded with artful scenery as it is here it may form a landscape in which the eye may find great entertainment The water which adorns this lodge we thought but indifferently managed though we were told it was con∣trived by the late Lord Chatham  From Alton to Alresford and from thence to Winchester we find little that excites atten∣tion The road is in general close till within a few miles of Winchester where the downs begin to open They are heavy uninteresting swells of ground but as we proceeded farther we admired some of the intersections of their vast heaving forms and had at least the plea∣sure of surveying a large tract of country in its original state on which neither Romans Sax∣ons Danes nor Britons seem to have made any impression  More impression has been made on these downs within these last half dozen years than had been made before in as many centuries Large portions of them are now inclosed and thrown into tillage    In a valley among these downs watered by a considerable stream lies Winchester As we descend into it the great church and the  King's House  as it is called are capital features and give it an air of grandeur  The south side of the great church is a piece of heavy unadorned Gothic But this was owing to accident Formerly the buildings of a monastery covered this side of it and the ar∣chitect William of Wickham who could not foresee the dissolution of monasteries thought it of no consequence to adorn a part of his church which could never be seen But when the monas∣tery was removed the defect became glaring Why the tower in the hands of so elegant an architect was left so ill proportioned is a question of surprise It certainly contributes to give the whole building an air of heaviness I doubt whether a spire was ever intended as it was not I believe among the Gothic orna∣ments of that day  The inside however of this cathedral is very grand except about the transept where there seems to have been some awkward con∣trivance The nave which is three hundred  feet in length is perhaps the most magnificent in England But it is injured by some monuments particularly that of the founder which trespass upon it they are placed between the pillars and bulge out into the middle aisle of the nave Indeed I know not whether monu∣ments at all in such churches as pride them∣selves on their architecture can in any shape be considered as ornamental the nave of WestminsterAbbey for instance is injured  as a piece of architecture  by the several monu∣ments introduced into it which like spots of light in a picture injure the  whole  they break in upon its simplicity and grandeur Thus too I doubt whether the introduction of monu∣ments will be any advantage to St Paul's I should fear they might injure the grandeur of the dome which the judicious architect had already adorned as much as he thought con∣sistent with the sublimity of his idea In all cathedrals there are cloisters and other recesses which are the proper situations for monuments and even here every thing should not be ad∣mitted that comes under the name of a monu∣ment and pays the fee Plain tablets may be allowed but when figures and ornaments are introduced they should be such as neither dis∣grace  the sculptor nor the person whom he meant to honour It would be of great advan∣tage also to class monuments as we hang pic∣tures in a room with some view to symmetry and order and if different professions were ranged by themselves it would still make it more agreeable to examine them  The choir of Winchester cathedral is greatly adorned but without any taste The  love of or∣nament  is one of the greatest sources of deform∣ity and it is the more to be lamented as it is very  expensive  and very  universal  It prevails from the churchwarden who paints the pillars of his parishchurch blue and the capitals yel∣low to the artist who gilds and carves the choir of a cathedral A taste of this kind pre∣vails here  In the first place the situation of the organ seems injudicious A view along the whole range of the church no doubt is grand but not I think of consequence to remove the organ into the awkward situation in which it now stands in the middle of one of the sides where it has no correspondent part besides an organ if judiciously adorned is a proper finishing to one end of the choir as the com∣muniontable  and its appendages are to the other  The woodwork in the choir is elegant Go∣thic but it is greatly injured by a blue band spangled with golden stars with which the ground behind it is adorned What the mean∣ing of this strange conceit is I could not con∣jecture  But the decoration of the altarpiece is the most offensive The choir is separated from the chapels beyond it by a lofty screen The tabernacle work of this screen still remaining shews it to have been of the purest Gothic It is divided into twelve compartments which are supposed to have held statues of the twelve apostles But these having been destroyed in the time of the civil wars each Gothic niche is injudiciously filled with a Roman urn  But the projection over the communiontable is still more offensive It is a sort of pent∣house hanging over the table and adorned with festoons of flowers They are said to have been carved by Gibbons and probably were but all the elegant touches of his chisel are destroyed At Hampton Court at Chats∣worth and wherever we have the works of this  master great care has been taken to preserve them in their original purity I believe not even a varnish has been suffered But here they are daubed all over with brown paint to∣tally at variance with every thing around them and as if that were not enough they are also adorned with profuse gilding  Inshrined amidst all this absurdity hangs West's picture of the Resurrection of Lazarus which is by no means in my opinion among the best works of this master The  compo∣sition  did not please me The whole is divided formally into three parts with too little con∣nection among them Jesus and his disciples stand on one side the spectators on the other Lazarus and his sisters occupy the middle Neither is the  effect of light  nor the  harmony of the colouring  more pleasing The colouring particularly which both the story and the situ∣ation of the picture required to be peculiarly modest is inharmoniously glaring The  parts  did not appear to more advantage than the  whole  There is but little of those passions and varied expression which the story is meant to excite In  drawing  Mr West is acknow∣ledged to be a perfect master But there is one thing in the picture which is particularly  displeasing Every painter should so far pro∣vide for the  distant effect  of his picture that no improper or disagreeable idea may be excited in the  general view  of it As you approach this picture without knowing what the subject is a figure at the foot of Lazarus gives the whole too much the appearance of  une femme accouchée  The skreen which separates the choir from the nave and the aisles is beautiful  in itself  but we are astonished that such an artist as Inigo Jones should not see the absurdity of adorning a Gothic church with a Grecian skreen The statues of James I and Charles I however they come there would have been in themselves more pleasing if their unclassical insignia of crowns and sceptres had been re∣moved  The  King's House  was built by Sir Christo∣pher Wren for Charles II It stands on the site of the old castle of Winchester loftily overlooking the city and is I think a beautiful piece of architecture Magnificent it certainly is extending in front above three hundred feet and if it had been completed in the grand style in which it was conceived with its lofty cupola and other appendages its gar∣dens  and parks laid out in ample space behind a noble bridge in front over the ditch and the street opened as was intended to the west end of the cathedral with which its front is parallel it would have been perhaps one of the grandest palaces in Europe The death of Charles put an end to the scheme It had afterwards another chance of being completed having been settled on Prince George of Den∣mark if he had survived Queen Anne Its last tenants were six thousand French prisoners from whose dilapidations it will not speedily recover  It has since been much more respectably occupied by a body of emigrant French priests but is now I believe con∣verted into a barrack    Winchester was not only a regal seat in Saxon times but one of the first towns in Bri∣tain Its history is full of curiosity and the antiquities with which it abounds confirm its history but among its antiquities I recollect no  object of beauty  except an old cross in the high street which is an exquisite piece of Go∣thic architecture and shews that the artists of those days could  adapt their ideas of proportion  as well to works of miniature as of grandeur This little structure rises from a basement of  half a dozen steps with curious open work in a pyramidal form It is ornamented in the richest manner but its ornaments are becom∣ing because they are introduced with propor∣tion uniformity and symmetry If the edges had been gilt and adorned with Chinese bells it would have been ornamented in a taste some∣thing like that employed in the choir of the cathedral  SECT V  FROM Winchester to Salisbury the road still continues along downs the parts of which often fold beautifully over each other This sort of country though in itself unpic∣turesque affords a good study for a landscapepainter It gives him a few large masterly strokes and forms an outline which the ima∣gination fills up About a mile short of Stock∣bridge we had a good distance on the left  As we gain the higher grounds about two or three miles before we reach Salisbury the lofty spire of the cathedral makes its first appearance and fixes the spot to which the road though devious will certainly carry us at last It is amusing to see a destined point before us as we come up to it by degrees It is amusing also to transfer our own motion to that of the object we approach It seems as the road winds to play with us shewing itself here and there sometimes totally disappearing and then rising where we did not expect to find it But the most pleasing circumstance in approaching  a grand object consists in its depositing by de∣grees its various tints of obscurity Tinged at first with the hazy hue of distance the spire before us was but little distinguished from the objects of the vale But as it was much nearer than those objects it soon began to as∣sume a deeper tint to break away from them and leave them behind As we get still nearer especially if a ray of sunshine happen to gild it the sharp touches on the pinnacles shew the richness of its workmanship and it begins gradually to assume its real form  Salisbury is a pleasant town with the sweet accommodation of a stream of limpid water running through every street But the only thing in it worth the attention of a picturesque eye is the great church and its appendages  Salisbury cathedral is esteemed the only pure specimen we have of the early style of Gothic architecture It marks the period when Saxon heaviness began first to give way It wants those light and airy members which we find in the cathedrals of York Canterbury Lincoln and others of a later period but it possesses one beauty which few of them possess that of symmetry in all its parts The spire is esteemed the loftiest structure of the kind in  England It is very light yet its great height especially when seen either from the east or west appears rather disproportioned and in∣deed on the whole I think no spire can be so pleasing an object as an elegant Gothic tower The tower is capable of receiving all the beau∣ties of Gothic ornament Those of many of our cathedrals indeed of many of our parish churches as of Derby for instance are adorned with great elegance but the spire tapering to a point does not present a sufficient surface for ornament The bands round that of Salisbury are rather a deformity nor do I see what Gothic ornaments so tapering a surface is capable of receiving for which reason though a plain wellproportioned spire may happily adorn a neat parish church and make a pic∣turesque object rising among woods or in the horizon I think it is not so well adapted to the rich style of a Gothic cathedral and in∣deed succeeding architects as the Gothic taste advanced in purity laid aside the spire and in general adopted the tower Pinnacles which are purely Gothic are very beautiful and for this reason the tower part or foundation of the spire at Salisbury which is adorned with them is the only part of it that is interesting  If instead of the spire something of a Gothic dome or rich open work had been carried up a moderate height I think it would have been more beautiful As it is the chief idea seems to have been to carry stones higher into the air than they were ever carried before  The inside of Salisbury cathedral is more beautiful than the outside The assemblage of its various parts so harmonious among them∣selves and its simple ornaments though of the rudest Gothic are very pleasing  There is one beautiful circumstance in it which I remember not to have seen with so good an effect▪ in any other cathedral except that of Wells To the east end of the choir St Mary's chapel is attached and appears se∣parated from it only by three large pointed open arches behind the communiontable The internal part of the chapel with its east window and pillars seen through these arches gives the conjunct idea of space and perspec∣tive which is very pleasing  But this cathedral also though in itself a noble piece of architecture has been much in∣jured by what is called  beautifying  The nave of the church and side aisles were painted as if they had been arched with brick Nothing  could be more absurd or disgusting The choir also was coloured with three tints which had a bad effect If the whole had been washed with one uniform stonecolour the natural lights and shades would have been seen to more advantage The prebendal stalls also and the organ were all decorated in the same awkward manner The ceiling too was patched over with circles containing ugly figures of le∣gendary saints and indeed the whole was a profusion of bad taste  To remove all this deformity and beautify the cathedral Mr Wyatt was engaged by the Bishop and Chapter and fully answered the expectation that was raised The figures on the roof are obliterated The whole is washed over with one uniform stonecolour and the ornaments of the Bishop's seat and the preben∣dal stalls are beautiful though rather perhaps in a style of later Gothic than the rest of the church  Across the middle of the choir from wall to wall just under the roof ran a massy beam eighty feet long and four feet square It was a very disgusting incumbrance but as it had rested there beyond the memory of man and was thought to bind the two walls together to  prevent their spreading it had never been touched Mr Wyatt however examined it and being persuaded it had no connection with the walls ventured to remove it and has done it without any bad consequence It was sup∣ported in two or three places by scaffolding and the middle part being sawn and taken away the ends were easily removed  The next question was what should be done with the three large arches which open the view into St Mary's chapel Should they be filled with tracerywork like the east win∣dows of some cathedrals Or should they be left open as they had always been The latter mode which was certainly the better was adopted Tracerywork would have been out of place in this cathedral which was built be∣fore that mode of ornament was introduced Besides a great beauty would have been lost which arises from a perspective view into the chapel  This question being settled another arose A very beautiful altarskreen was constructed out of the ornaments of a little chapel which had formerly been attached to the church and which Mr Wyatt found it necessary to re∣move The question was where should this  skreen be placed Some thought it might be placed best at the end of St Mary's chapel so that it might be seen to advantage through the arches which were to be left open entirely to the bottom In this case the communiontable was to be moveable and to be brought for∣ward into the choir only when it was wanted Others were of opinion that the communiontable should stand fixed where it had ever stood and the skreen which was a very low one should be placed just behind it so as merely to hide the  bases  of the pillars and the pavement of St Mary's chapel permitting at the same time a perspective view into it above the skreen The former of these opinions pre∣vailed though some thought it might have been more  proper  and more in  taste  to have taken the latter It might have been more  proper  because it would have made a separation be∣tween the church and the chapel which is as desirable at one end as the separation made by the skreen and the organ between the choir and nave is at the other Besides the com∣muniontable is a natural adjunct to the choir and could not be removed without making an  improper  break It might also be thought in∣decent by many people and give offence This  separation might likewise have been more in  taste  because the eye not having so good a cri∣terion of distance as would be afforded by see∣ing the  bases  of the pillars and  pavement  of the chapel would have conceived the distance to the eastwindow of the chapel greater than it really is so that the idea being thus in part curtailed would in fact have been enlarged It is an undoubted rule in painting that an  exact delineation  of a grand object injures its sublimity Whatever is discretely left to the imagination is always improved These re∣marks however are founded only in theory and it is possible the skreen may have a better effect where it stands at present  The east window of St Mary's chapel is adorned with a picture of the Resurrection in painted glass Sir Joshua Reynolds gave the design in which though he had represented our Saviour rising he had left the tomb still closed and sealed The Bishop remonstrated that he had given the fact contrary to the truth of Scripture where it is said the seal was broken and the stone removed Sir Joshua however still persisted contending that by not breaking the seal he had made the miracle so much the greater and it was not without  some difficulty that the Bishop got him per∣suaded to correct his design The truth I suppose was Sir Joshua had not fully at first attended to the circumstances of the story and did not care to be at the trouble of altering his picture How far this window in the hands of so eminent a master may be beautiful I know not It was not finished when I was last at Salisbury But if it be not better than the other eastwindow given by Lord Radnor which is esteemed good in its kind it will in my judgment be a disagreeable ornament In∣deed if colours cannot be better blended on glass and harmonized than I ever saw them I own I should never wish to see an historical subject painted in this way The gloom of a painted window in an old cathedral is pleas∣ing but I should desire only ornamental scrawls The best painted windows I remem∣ber to have seen were I believe in the cha∣pel at Magdalen College in Oxford They are single figures and only in clair obscure They are the best because they are the least glaring  The choir of Salisbury cathedral thus im∣proved under the able hands of Mr Wyatt is now one of the most beautiful pieces of Gothic  architecture in England The deformities of the nave and grand aisles I fear will not soon be removed as there is a deficiency in the fund but they greatly call for improvement  Adjoining to the church is a square cloister opening into a chapterhouse In abbies we suppose the cloister was a place for the monks to enjoy exercise under cover But from the connection of this cloister with the chapterhouse we are led to imagine it was intended also as a place for tenants and suitors to wait under shelter till each was called into the chap∣terhouse to settle his respective business The chapterhouse and cloisters are in the same way connected at Gloucester and may probably be so in other cathedrals  The cloister and the chapterhouse at Salis∣bury belong to an age of much better taste in architecture than that of the cathedral itself They are both of very pure and elegant Go∣thic The former is a light airy square of about forty feet on each side The latter is an octagon of fifty feet in diameter with a pointed roof supported by a light column rather per∣haps too light in the centre Nothing in ar∣chitecture I think can be more pleasing than these buildings nor does any thing militate  so much against a servile attachment to the five orders The Greek and Roman architecture no doubt possess great beauty but why should we suppose them to possess  all  beauty If men were left to their own genius and invention as the founders of the Gothic probably were we might it is true have many absurd com∣positions which we have even  now  but we should certainly have greater  variety  and amidst that variety no doubt several new and elegant models But the five orders have drawn the art so much to themselves that it would be heresy in architecture to oppose their canons  Rules we allow must confine  every art  but what rules are necessary to confine  archi∣tecture  except those of  utility symmetry pro∣portion  and  simplicity Utility  respects the pur∣poses for which an edifice is raised  symmetry  the general purity and sameness of the style  proportion  the relation of parts  simplicity  the modesty and propriety of ornaments I know not in which of these requisites the Gothic does not equal the Roman If in any it may be thought to fail it is in the ornamental part  In what taste the private buildings of those times were constructed when Gothic architec∣ture was in its splendor we know not It is probable they were not designed by the emi∣nent professors of the art but by low mecha∣nics according to every man's humour with∣out rule or knowledge Many of them no doubt were inconvenient enough as well as wretchedly adorned But in the  public  buildings of those times there is generally such propriety of ornament that is each ornamental member  arises so naturally from the building itself  and is so much of a  piece with it  which seems to be all we wish in ornament that in the best spe∣cimens of Gothic architecture the eye is no where offended or called aside by the conten∣tion of parts but examines all  whole  and  parts  together in one  general view  In the  interior  perhaps the Gothic architect is com∣monly more chaste than in the  exterior  in which he allows himself more to wanton and indeed seems to have had a worse choice of proper ornaments But in our best compo∣sitions the outside as well as the inside is highly beautiful For myself I freely own I am as much struck with the cathedral of York  or with this cloister and chapterhouse covered as they are with ornaments as with the noble simplicity of the cathedral of St Paul's Each style is beautiful  But in comparing the Gothic and Grecian ornaments in architecture the comparison holds merely with regard to such ornaments as are  fanciful and ideal  In portraying or combin∣ing such ornaments as have  nature for their ori∣ginal  either in human or in animal life the Gothic sculptor is in general miserably de∣ficient He had little knowledge of Nature in  forming  and less of Art in  combining  and yet he is often offending with some gross repre∣sentation of this kind  In the chapterhouse at Salisbury for in∣stance which gave occasion to these remarks amidst all that beautiful profusion of  fancied ornaments  so elegant in themselves and so well adapted to the building to which they are ap∣plied there is likewise a great profusion of historical sculpture The several sides of the room are divided into stalls for the members of the church I believe there are not fewer than fifty and the little angular divisions between the stalls are adorned with basrelief As Go∣thic workmanship it is not bad though it is  very inferior to Roman or modern sculpture There is no idea either of grace or taste or even of proportion in the figures themselves nor in the mode of combining them They all represent scripture stories some of which are very illmanaged In the story of Noah two beasts are looking out of a window in the ark sufficient to load it and Noah himself praying at the poop is sufficient to sink it After the civil wars the parliament commis∣sioners sat in this chapterhouse and have left behind them marks of their rough ideas of re∣ligion At this sculpture they seem to have taken particular offence and have hacked it miserably They began as they entered on the left and for a while erased every thing before them but they seem to have grown tired as they proceeded in their work the middle part therefore is but little injured and the figures on the right are perfect If however the in∣side of this elegant building were washed over with one uniform stonecolour the sculpture obtrudes itself so little on the eye that bad as it is it might easily pass unobserved Both the cloister and chapterhouse are in so decaying a state that it would require a great sum to re∣store them though there is now in the library  an estimate given in about an hundred years ago from which it appears that the whole might then have been completely repaired for l It appears also from another paper in the library of ancient date that the cathedral cost marks in building about twenty eight thousand pounds which is a much larger sum than we should have supposed it could have cost at that early day  Near the cathedral stands the bishop's pa∣lace which till very lately was one of the most gloomy mansions that can well be imagined It was a large incumbered house with about a dozen acres of flat ground by way of garden lying behind it This garden was bisected with a broad canal and confined within an embattled wall Such an assemblage of awk∣ward circumstances are not often united  The present Bishop of Salisbury  Bishop Barrington  has at great expence entirely newmodelled this gloomy palace He has altered the rooms enlarged the windows made a new entrance and given a new appearance to the whole place One great and very expensive improve∣ment was to arch over a wide drain which  was carried along the whole backfront of the palace It was passed at different places by two or three bridges and was such a nuisance that we are surprised it had been suffered so long  As to the flat grounds which were bisected with the canal laid out in vistas and circum∣scribed by an embattled wall it was impossible to do more than to remove a few of the for∣malities of the place and carry a neat gravel walk round it which near the house plays among a few irregular plantations  But one improvement he has introduced which adds a grandeur to the garden beyond what any episcopal seat in England can boast He has brought the cathedral into it in one of its most pleasing points of perspective Be∣tween the palace and the cathedral ran for∣merly a wall which included a piece of ground belonging to the bishops of Salisbury and used as a kitchengarden  This wall and the kitchengarden Bishop Barrington has removed and has not only obtained a  noble object  but he has exchanged the disagreeable appearance of a long straight wall for a very grand boundary to his garden The cloister and chapterhouse are the parts  immediately introduced whose several abut∣ments and projections are pleasing circum∣stances From these rises the body of the cathedral and the spire having here a larger base appears more in proportion  About a mile from Salisbury Old Sarum for∣merly stood Its situation and establishment were both very singular  Imagine the  ridge  of a hill falling into a  plain  from the end of which a part having been artificially separated forms a round knoll of about two thousand feet in diameter Cooped within this narrow compass stood on a still higher knoll in the centre a formidable castle and just below it a cathedral Here also stood the bishop's palace together with the houses of his chapter and the whole was surrounded with immense ditches and ram∣parts which strike us with astonishment even at this daySo close a union between a castle and a cathedral insulated as they were and seated so loftily must have made a very singular appearance though probably they never had much picturesque beauty  Many retainers no doubt there were on so large a foundation but it does not appear that any houses except those of the chapter were admitted within the precincts of the fortress Other appendages seem to have been placed as a suburb under its walls  Here the bishops of Salisbury lived like temporal princes till king Stephen suspecting the bishop of that day was attached to the empress Maud dispossessed him of his castle of Sarum together with two other castles which he held one at Sherborn from whence the see had been removed by William I and the other at the DevizesThe castle of Sarum was given to a Norman earl who held a garrison in it for the king  This became matter of continual contest The clergy and the garrison were at constant variance Once the bishop and his clergy returning from a procession found the gates shut against them  Wearied at length by repeated insults they complained to the pope and at length got a dispensation to remove the see of Salisbury to its present situation This was soon found to be so very convenient in comparison of the old one that it drew the inhabitants of  Old Sarum by degrees after it The castle was left by itself and in a few years it also was deserted and Old Sarum became only a heap of ruins But these ruins deserted as they are preserve a substantial proof of their antient dignity in being represented by two members in parliament  SECT VI  FROM Salisbury our first excursion was to Longford Castle the seat of the earl of Radnor It was built about the time of James the First on a Danish model probably by some architect who came into England with the queen Its form is triangular with a round tower at each corner which gives it a singu∣lar appearance It stands in a vale which approaches nearly to a flat as the Avon which passes through the garden does to stag∣nation Longford Castle therefore borrows little from its situation All its beauty is the result of art which cannot rise beyond what may be called  pleasing  But the principal objects here are the pictures The whole collection is good The following we thought some of the best  A Return from the Chace by Teniers The composition of this master is rarely so good as it is here His colouring is always pleas∣ing  A boy by Rubens  Peter de Jode's family by Vandyck The heads in this picture are perfect copies from Nature  A view of Tivoli  A landscape by Hobima The composition the light and the execution in this picture are all good  Tobias by Spagniolet  Two pictures by Poussin In these as in many of this master's works there is a great deficiency in point of general effect but the classical spirit in which they are painted with the pure taste of design and correctness in the parts will always give value to the works of Poussin These I think are executed with a firmer pencil and more spirited touch than most of his works  A landscape by Ruysdaal  Two small paintings by Callot It is sur∣prising with what smart touches this master enlivens his figures His pictures have all the spirit and precision of his etchings  But the two most admired pictures in this collection are two landscapes by Claude which exhibit the  rise  and  decline  of the Ro∣man empire in a pleasing allegory The for∣mer  is represented by a sunrise and the land∣ing of Eneas in Italy the latter by a sunset and several Roman buildings in ruin No∣thing can exceed the colouring of both these pictures The hazy light of a rising sun and the glowing radiance of a setting one are exactly copied from nature and therefore  nicely distinguished  An eye accurate in the effects of nature will easily discern with which species of light the summit of the wave or the edge of the battlement is tipped And yet Claude has in none of his pictures that I have seen discriminated the  shadows  of the morn∣ing which are certainly much darker than those of the evening He does not indeed appear to have marked the difference between them Nor do we observe that painters in general are more accurate Now and then with Nature before him Claude possibly may give a morningshadow its character but when an effect is very rare it appears to be the result of  imitation  rather than of  prin∣ciple  With regard to  aërial landscape  Claude excelled all masters We are at a loss whe∣ther to admire more the  simplicity  or the  ef∣fect  of his distances  But when we have bestowed this commend∣ation on him we have summed up his merit It all lay in colouring We rarely find an instance of good composition in any of his pictures and still more rarely an exhibition of any grand scene or appearance of Nature As he lived in Italy he had frequent oppor∣tunities of seeing much sublime scenery but as it seldom struck him we cannot help in∣ferring that his genius was not sublime If a Dutch master who has seen nothing but a flat country introduces neither rocks nor cas∣cades nor the sloping sides of hills into his pictures it is no wonder but if a painter who has studied among the Alps and Appen∣nines rejects them it is evident that he has no taste for this species of scenery Claude and Salvator received or might have received their ideas from the same archetypes they were both Italian painters but Claude studied in the Campagna of Rome Salvator among the mountains of Calabria While the one therefore admired the tamer beauties of Na∣ture the other caught fire and rose to the sublime I do not mean to insinuate that Claude painted like a Dutchman but only that his genius was less sublime than Salva∣tor's  It is true the objects he painted are of the  grand species  he saw no other But as he seldom made the best use of them by bring∣ing them forward and producing  grand effects  it is plain he saw them with indifference and we conclude it was much the same to him whether he painted by the side of a stagnant canal at Harlem or under the fall of a cascade at Tivoli In short he seems to have had a knack of colouring certain objects skies and distances in particular and this is accounted for by his residing chiefly in the Campagna As to his figures and foregrounds if they do not disgust the eye it is all we expect His buildings too are often unpleasing and in∣cumbered and seem calculated rather to shew his skill in architecture than in the production of picturesque beautyIt is saying how∣ever much in favour of Claude that he had been bred a pastrycook and that if he did not do all that might have been done he did much more than could have been expected  SECT VII  OUR next expedition from Salisbury was to Stonehenge and Wilton  Stonehenge at a distance appeared only a diminutive object Standing on so vast an area as Salisbury Plain it was lost in the im∣mensity around it As we approached it gained more respect and we could now trace a large ditch round the whole confined within a gentle mound But when we arrived on the spot it appeared astonishing beyond con∣ception A train of wondering ideas imme∣diately crowded into the mind Who brought these huge masses of rock together Whence were they brought For what purpose By what machines were they drawn Or by what mechanic powers erected  Many have attempted to solve such questions as these but none have gone farther than con∣jecture Even the very purpose for which these stones were brought together is not suf∣ficiently ascertained Mr Walpole remarks that whoever has examined this monument  has ascribed it to that class of antiquity of which he himself was most fond This was at least the case of the celebrated Inigo Jones On his return from Italy having nothing but Italian architecture in his head he found out that Stonehenge was a Roman ruin  Many idle things no doubt have been writ∣ten on this subject It is a happy field for conjecture On the whole perhaps the la∣borious inquiries of Dr Stukeley have been at∣tended with the most success for though nei∣ther he nor any man could answer all the in∣quiries which curiosity is apt to make on this subject yet he seems to have contributed more towards a just idea of this wonderful monu∣ment than any other antiquarian He has gone upon principle He has traced it by its  measures  and other data into Druid times and as far as appears conviction follows his researches In his long discussion he may in some parts be whimsical and in many cer∣tainly tedious but allowances should be made for a man full of his subject who of course will see many things which he supposes to be of consequence and which he cannot in few words make apparent to others  Of these stones there are an hundred and forty and by calculation it appears that each of the largest of them would require the strength of an hundred and fifty oxen to move it  The outer circle has been formed by a com∣bination of two uprights and an impost yet each combination of these three stones is de∣tached and without any connection with the rest except that of coinciding in the form of a circle Many of these uprights still remain but only five with the imposts annexed  The inner circle never had any imposts but consisted only of upright stones Ten of these are still standing out of forty of which the ori∣ginal number is supposed to have consisted  Besides these circles there are some internal parts formed of stones placed eliptically some of which also have had imposts These Dr Stukeley conceives to have been the recesses of the priests In this part of the circle also is placed a stone which he supposes to have been an altar  Rough as all this work appears now to be after having been exposed to the storms of two thousand winters it has been originally con∣structed wlth wonderful art All the stones  seem to have been chiseled on the inside espe∣cially with great care and the imposts have all been let into the uprights by mortices and tenons very curiously wrought  But it is not the  elegance of the work  but the  grandeur of the idea  that strikes us The walk between the two circles which is a cir∣cumference of three hundred feet is awfully magnificent at least it would have been so if the monument had been entire To be im∣mured as it were by such hideous walls of rock and to see the landscape and the sky through such strange apertures must have thrown the imagination into a wonderful fer∣ment The Druid though savage in his na∣ture had the sublimest ideas of the object of his worship whatever it was He always wor∣shipped under the canopy of the sky and could not bear the idea of a roof between him and heaven I have known the idea sometimes taken up by pious christians who have con∣fessed they found their minds most expanded when they worshipped in the open air  Stonehenge is supposed to be the grandest structure of the kind that exists We meet with many other Druidical remains of this form though of inferior size But I have  somewhere heard of one in France inferior indeed to Stonehenge in magnificence but su∣perior to it in elegant construction The im∣posts  uniting with each other  form one conti∣nued circle of stone on the top of the uprights which makes a more pleasing appearance than Stonehenge where each impost resting on two uprights stands detached from its neighbour  Wonderful however as Stonehenge is and plainly discovering that the mind which con∣ceived it was familiar with great ideas it is to∣tally void though in a ruinous state of every idea of picturesque beauty and I should sup∣pose was still more so in its perfect one We walked round it examined it on every side and endeavoured to take a perspective view of it but in vain the stones are so uncouthly placed that we found it was impossible to form them from any stand into a pleasing shape  Besides these stones there are others of im∣mense size in different parts of the island though none I believe so large Near Bo∣roughbridge two or three of the largest are found which are known by the name of the  Devil's Arrows  Volney in his Travels through Syria men∣tions three stones of white granite among the  ruins of Balbeck each of which was twelve feet thick and which together extended above fiftyeight yards And in an adjacent quarry he found a stone lying half chiseled which was sixtynine feet long and in breadth and thickness about thirteen It was probably too large to be carried from the spot  Vol ii p    About two miles from Dol in Bretagne in the middle of an orchard Mr Wraxall tells us there is a single stone fixed in the earth of a conic form which is about fortyfive feet high and nearly as many broad It had long puz∣zled the antiquarians of the country and gave rise to various conjectures Some of them however endeavoured to get at its found∣ation There they found it was really a na∣tural production being fixed to a stratum of solid rock several feet below the surface  Tour through France p    The plain on which Stonehenge stands is in the same style of greatness as the temple that adorns it It extends many miles in all direc∣tions in some not less than fifty An eye un∣versed in these objects is filled with astonish∣ment  in viewing waste after waste rising out of each new horizon  Such appears the spacious plain  Of Sarum spread like Ocean's boundless round  Where solitary Stonehenge grey with moss  Ruin of ages nods  The ground is spread indeed as the poet ob∣serves  like the ocean  but it is like the ocean after a storm it is continually heaving in large swells Through all this vast district scarce a cottage or even a bush appears If you ap∣proach within two or three miles of the edge of the plain you see like the mariner within soundings land at a distance houses trees and villages but all around is waste  Regions like this which have come down to us rude and untouched from the beginning of time fill the mind with grand conceptions far beyond the efforts of art and cultivation Impressed by such views of nature our ances∣tors worshiped the God of nature in these boundless scenes which gave them the highest conceptions of eternity Such were the grand ideas of the patriarch as he ranged the wide regions of the east and set up his monumental pile not adorned with vases or statues but a mound of earth a rude pillar which he called  God's House  or some vast heap of stones of a fabric firm as the ground on which it stood like this before us which has seen in succession the ruins of innumerable works of art and will probably remain undiminished till the end of time  All the plain at least that part of it near Stonehenge is one vast cemetary Every where as we passed we saw tumuli or  barrows  as they are called rising on each hand These little mounds of earth are more curiously and elegantly shaped than any of the kind I re∣member elsewhere to have seen They com∣monly rise in the form of bells and each of them hath a neat trench fashioned round its base though in their forms and in the orna∣mental circles at their bases some appear to be of more distinguished workmanship They are of various sizes sometimes of thirty some∣times of forty or fifty yards in diameter From many places we counted above an hundred of them at once sometimes as if huddled toge∣ther without any design in other places rising in a kind of order By the rays of a setting sun the distant barrows are most conspicuously seen Every little summit being tipped with a splendid light while the plain is in shadow  is at that time easily distinguished Most of them are placed on the more elevated parts of the plain and generally in sight of the great temple That they are mansions of the dead is undoubted many of them having been opened and found to cover the bones both of men and beasts the latter of which were pro∣bably sacrificed at the funeral We suppose also that some of them contained the promis∣cuous ashes of a multitude as Virgil describes them  Confusae ingentem caedis acervum  "Nec numero nec honore cremant Tunc undique "vasti  "Certatim crebris collucent ignibus agri  "Tertia lux gelidam coelo dimoverat umbram  "Moerentes altum cinerem et confusa ruebant  "Ossa focis tepidoque onerabant aggere terrae"  Indeed this mode of burial as the most ho∣nourable seems to have been dictated by the voice of nature We meet with it in Homer we meet with it in Herodotus The vestiges of it are found on the vast plains of Tartary and even among the savages of Guinea  That we do not ascribe more antiquity to these temples and cemetaries than rightly be∣longs to them the antiquarian hath shewn by many learned arguments I shall subjoin an∣other  of classic origin from which it will ap∣pear probable that the furniture of these vast plains was exactly the same in Caesar's days as it is now  That chief in the first book of his Com∣mentaries describing the place which was agreed on to be the scene of conference be∣tween him and Ariovistus tells us it was an extensive plain in which was a large artificial mount  Planities erat magna et in ea tumulus terreus satis grandis  I translate  terreus  by the word  artificial  because it certainly implies some∣thing factitious No correct writer speaking of a  natural hill  would use such an epithet It would be a mere redundancy and just as im∣proper as if he had said  Planities erat magna terrea  But in describing an  artificial mount  it is certainly proper because such a mount might have been constructed of other materials besides  earth  That Caesar's  tumulus  was intended also as a memorial for the dead is probable from the common use of the word  tumulus  especially when accompanied with the epithet  terreus  for we know no other use for which these  tumuli terrei  or  artificial mounts  were con∣structed but that of being memorials of the  dead and for this use we know they cer∣tainly were constructed We find Aeneas like∣wise haranguing his troops from a tomb of this kind  Socios in caetum littore ab omni Advocat Aeneas tumulique ex aggere fatur  Having thus settled Caesar's  tumulus terreus  to have been a  barrow  and knowing also from him that the Druids frequented Gaul we are led to believe that his  planities magna  and  Sa∣lisbury Plain  were places of the same kind both of them most probably Druid scenes Caesar indeed mentions but one tumulus on his plain but as he was describing only a parti∣cular spot not the general scene we may easily suppose there might be many other barrows and perhaps a Stonehenge also in the neigh∣bourhood of it  It is probable also as Caesar tells us the Druid discipline was carried originally into Gaul from Britain which was the great source of Druidlearning  Disciplina haec in Britannia reperta atque inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur et nunc qui diligentius eam rem cog∣noscere volunt plerumque illò discendi causâ proficiscuntur  Lib iv  that Salisbury Plain might  have been a scene of great antiquity many years before the time of Caesar  Though Salisbury Plain in Druid times was probably a very busy scene we now find it wholly uninhabited Here and there we meet a flock of sheep scattered over the side of some rising ground and a shepherd with his dog attending them or perhaps we may de∣scry some solitary waggon winding round a distant hill But the only resident inhabitant of this vast waste is the bustard This bird which is the largest fowl we have in England is fond of all extensive plains and is found on several but these are supposed to be his principal haunt Here he breeds and here he spends his summerday feeding with his mate on juicy berries and the large dewworms of the heath As winter approaches he forms into society Fifty or sixty have been some∣times seen together  As the bustard leads his life in these unfre∣quented wilds and studiously avoids the haunts of men the appearance of any thing in mo∣tion though at a considerable distance alarms him I know not that he is protected like the partridge and pheasant by any law but his own vigilance is a better security to him than  an act of parliament As he is so noble a prize his flesh so delicate and the quantity of it so large he is of course frequently the ob∣ject of the fowler's stratagems But his cau∣tion is generally a protection against them all The scene he frequents affords neither tree to shelter nor hedge to skreen an enemy and he is so tall that when he raises his neck to take a perspective view his eye circumscribes a very wide horizon All open attempts therefore against him are fruitless The fowl∣er's most promising stratagem is to conceal himself in a waggon The west country wag∣gons periodically travelling these regions are objects to which the bustard is most accus∣tomed and though he retires at their ap∣proach he retires with less evident signs of alarm than from any thing else It is possible therefore if the fowler lie close in such a con∣cealment and with a long barrelled gun can direct a good aim he may make a lucky shot Sometimes also he slips from the tail of a wag∣gon a couple of swift greyhounds They soon come up with the bustard though he runs well and if they can contrive to reach him just as he is on the point of taking wing an operation which he performs with less expe∣dition  than is requisite in such critical circum∣stances they may perhaps seize him  Some encroachments have been made by the plough within these few years upon Salisbury Plain But these inroads though considerable in themselves bear little proportion to the vast∣ness of these downy grounds The plough is a heavy invader and its perseverance only can produce a visible effect in so vast a scene  Another reason also may operate powerfully in preserving these wide domains in a state of nature The soil is in most places very shal∣low not above five or six inches above a rock of chalk and as the tillage of two or three years exhausts it without more expence than the land will answer it hath been thought but ill husbandry to destroy a good sheepwalk for a bad piece of arable land  But though Salisbury Plain is a remarkable scene in England it is nothing in comparison of many scenes of this kind on the face of the globe in which the eye is carried if I may so phrase it  out of sight  where an extent of land flat like the ocean melts gradually into the horizon Such are many parts of Poland and Tartary The plains of Yedesan on the bor∣ders of Bessarabia are among the most extra∣ordinary  Baron de Tott describes them on his journey to the Cham of Tartary as so im∣mense that he tells us somewhat I think hy∣perbolically the piercing eyes of the Tartars who rode before him could distinguish the heads of the horsemen in the horizon when the  convexity of the earth hid the rest of their bodies  His description is more natural after∣wards when he says he saw the sun rise and set on these plains as navigators do at sea Their singularity consists both in their vastness and in certain regular vallies which bisect them These vallies are distant from each other about ten or twelve leagues and run in parallel lines across the plain They are totally void of the usual ornaments of our vallies va∣riety of ground a foaming rivulet and woody banks they are mere trenches cut out by Nature about twenty yards deep and some∣times a quarter of a mile broad so that as you traverse the plain the eye passes over them like sunk fences and all appears one boundless waste Through the middle of each of these vallies is a muddy rivulet and as there is no elevation of ground it is almost stagnant The course of these rivulets such as it is leads from north to south and at the end of the plain they form  small lakes which communicate with the Black Sea In these vallies the Tartars of Yedesan fix their tents while their numerous herds of horses oxen dromedaries and sheep graze the plains These herds are continually wander∣ing from home in summer especially the larger kinds and the chief employment of the Tar∣tar is to gallop about in quest of them He takes a quantity of roasted millet in a bag mounts his horse and rides till sunset Then if he find not what he sought he clogs his horse and leaves it to graze and as he is al∣ways at home he sups wraps himself in his cloak and sleeps till morning when he begins his search again Having given this general account of the plains of Yedesan Baron Tott speaks of his first day's journey over them The conclusion of it was the nearest valley at about ten leagues distance The sun was now setting and after a long journey  I still saw nothing before me  says he  but a vast melancholy plain when I suddenly felt my carriage descend and looking out I saw a range of tents extending to the right and left We crossed a rivulet over a bad bridge and found three tents on the other side out of the line one of which was intended for me  It was a kind of large hencoop constructed in a circular form with a sort of dome open∣ing at the top and was covered with a felt of camels hair The paling was connected by slips of raw hides and finished with great strength and delicacy  See Memoirs of Baron de Tott vol i p    But of all the plains of which we meet with any account those of the deserts of Arabia are the most forbidding Perhaps no part of the globe of equal circumference is so totally des∣titute of Nature's bounty and of every kind of vegetable furniture  The whole  A wild expanse of lifeless sand and sky  The Tartarean plains just described are bi∣sected with streams and vallies such as they are covered with herbage But the barren∣ness of the Arabian plain in no part inter∣mits The tents horses and camels of the caravan to which the traveller is attached are the only objects he sees If he should fix one end of an immense cord at these tents the other might be carried round along the rim of a boundless horizon without sweeping over any inequality All this vast circle is covered  with grey sand like the ashes of a furnace Over all hangs the canopy of heaven undiver∣sified by a single cloud to break the rays of a scorching sun while a breeze if it can be called such glowing with heat often fills the air with clouds of overwhelming dust or to∣tally destroys its vital spring  Breathed hot  From all the boundless furnace of the sky  And the wide glittering waste of burning sand  A suffocating wind the pilgrim smites  With instant death Patient of thirst and toil  Son of the desert even the camel feels  Shot through his withered heart the fiery blast  In the mean time a universal silence reigns over the whole vast scene None of the chearful sounds of nature are heard neither of beast nor of bird nor even of humming insect All is still as night With such a country as this Moses threatens the people of Israel on their disobedience  The heaven that is over thy head shall be brass and the earth that is under thee shall be iron The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust From heaven shall it come down upon thee till thou be destroyed  Deut xxviii  There is however an appearance in these  deserts taken notice of by Sir John Chardin which is rather picturesque A splendor or vapour is sometimes formed by the repercussion of the rays of the sun from the sand which seems at a distance a vast lake But as the thirsty traveller approaches in hopes of finding water it retires before him or totally disap∣pears  Sir J Chardin's MSS as quoted by Harmer  Q Curtius takes notice of the same effect in one of the marches of Alexander  Thus we see how  differently  Nature works up the  same modes  of scenery and there is great amusement in bringing these several scenes to∣gether and in following her steps through all her similar but varied operations  SECT VIII  HAVING satisfied our curiosity on Salis∣bury Plain and performed the due rites at Stonehenge by pacing its dimensions and counting the stones we proceeded to Wilton The point of Salisbury spire just emerging from the horizon guided us across the open country and as we got into the more cul∣tivated part we turned out of the Salisbury road and fell down into Wilton which lies in a vale on the edge of the plain We can∣not expect a very beautiful scene in the neigh∣bourhood of such a waste Nature's tran∣sitions are generally gradual The true pic∣turesque vale is rarely found in any country but a mountainous one Great plenty of wood and water however give an agreeable air to the vale of Wilton  Wilton was once the capital of all this country to which it gave its name But Salisbury drawing Old Sarum within its vor∣tex drew Wilton also At present this vil∣lage is chiefly remarkable for the splendid pa∣lace of the Earls of Pembroke  Wiltonhouse was formerly an Abbey and felt the full weight of the inquisition set on foot in the reign of Henry the Eighth The ladies of Wiltonabbey were accused of too great an intimacy with the monks of a neigh∣bouring house Stories of this kind were listened to at the time of the dissolution with great attention though often perhaps void of any foundation Both houses however fell together and the demesnes of Wilton were given to the Pembroke family in whose hands they still continue The earl of that day began immediately to turn the abbey into a mansion but the plan was not completed in its present state till late in the reign of Charles I The gardenfront by Inigo Jones is admired by all judges of architecture The portico boasts the hand of Hans Holbein There are some things however yet wanting to give the house an air of magnificence The entrance is particularly awkward and incum∣bered  Since this was written it has been altered    As the morning threatened rain we thought it better to take a view of the garden before we entered the house it occupies the centre  of a wide valley adorned with a river This river was fashioned by the conductors of taste in the last age into an immense canal It is now changed again into an irregular piece of water But though its banks are decorated with rich gardenscenes it still retains enough of formality to suggest the old idea It forms however the grandest view in the garden Salisbury church comes in very happily as an object at the bottom of it and is of sufficient magnitude to shew that it was not constructed for the purpose  Gardenscenes are never  picturesque  They want the bold roughness of nature A prin∣cipal beauty in our  gardens  as Mr Walpole justly observes is the smoothness of the turf but in a  picture  this becomes a dead and uni∣form spot incapable of light and shade and must be broken insipidly by children dogs and other unmeaning figures that is I suppose Mr Walpole means by such figures as commonly frequent gardenscenes which are of all others the most unpicturesque And yet I have been informed that Mr B Wilson made a good landscape even of this scene He took it however from that end which is nearest to Salisbury where he got  a rougher  foreground  than he could find in the garden In a  distance  he might more easily disguise a  gardenscene  Opposite to the house the river Willy enters the canal It is a river only of small dimen∣sions but over it is thrown a magnificent Pal∣ladian bridge  I have sometimes thought the Palladian bridge may be considered as a species of bom∣bast in architecture It is like expressing a plain  sentiment  in a  pompous phrase  Merely to pass a trifling stream a plank with a simple rail is sufficient and in a  pastoral  scene it is all you require In such a scene as  this  indeed a simple plank would be  out of place  You are composing  in heroics  But a certain species of simplicity is required even here and as in all  literary compositions  turgid expressions offend why should they not offend in  every  mode of composition Here we allow a handsome bridge is necessary But why  more  than a bridge What have pillarswallspediments and roofs to do with a bridge A bridge in itself is one of the most beautiful of artificial objects but dressed in this bombast style it offends it offends at least the simplicity of a picturesque eye If you want a cool airy  building to receive the refreshment of a sum∣mer breeze as it passes over the lake erect one in some proper place and if it be well dis∣posed nobody can take offence But let it stand for what it is Do not leave people in doubt whether it is a house or a bridge by  uniting  modes of architecture which are in themselves  distinct  and giving one the orna∣ments that belong to another From these criticisms we except such bridges as are situ∣ated like the Rialto at Venice which connect∣ing the parts of a large city may be allowed to assume a correspondent air of grandeur and may with propriety even be covered with a roof But here no such accommodation is necessary and what is unnecessary is always affected  From the Palladian bridge and banks of the river the ground rises beautifully consisting of a hanging lawn encompassed with wood which is broken into pleasing parts But here though in sight of the Palladian bridge we have another ornament full as much out of  place  as the other was out of  form  On the summit of the hill is erected a tri∣umphal arch with Marcus Aurelius mounted on horseback on the top of it  Now if we only recollect the intention of a triumphal arch we shall see how grotesquely such a fabric is erected here  When a Roman general triumphed it was the custom to raise these arches through which the procession passed to the city and they were sometimes constructed and adorned in a very magnificent manner and left as memo∣rials of the great event on which they were at first erected All this was noble and admir∣ably adapted to the intended purpose But we have here a triumphal arch set upon the top of a hill totally unconnected with any thing near it A triumphal arch would be perhaps too pompous a structure to form a part of the  approach  to the house yet in that capacity it might have been  suffered  it might have had some analogy at least to its situation But as it now stands however good it may be in it∣self it is certainly an absurd ostentatious orna∣ment  The rain coming on obliged us to leave the rest of the garden unseen and drove us into the house It prevented also our seeing the stables which are very grand and what we still regretted more a row of cedars of Liba∣non which are esteemed the finest in England  We saw them afterwards from the windows of the house but probably to some disadvantage as they did not answer the expectations we had formed of them  The grand collection of statues in Wiltonhouse entitle it very deservedly to the attention of every traveller When we enter the great hall we are struck with the profusion of them  At the first view of such a collection it be∣comes matter of wonder how Italy can be so inexhaustible a fund of ancient statues Be∣sides their peopling all the palaces of that coun∣try there is not a cabinet in Europe which is not more or less inhabited by them All come from Italy Italy has been supplying the cu∣rious with antiques for many centuries and they who have money may buy antiques in Italy still  The wonder will in some degree subside when we consider the rage for sculpture which possessed the ancient Romans Statues were the chief ornaments of old Rome and had for ages been collected there by all ranks of people  The conquest of Greece brought them first into repute As they became more admired praetors and proconsuls made them every where  the objects of rapine Not only Greece but the Aegean isles Asia and Egypt were pillaged Statues bassreliefs busts pillars every thing that could be severed from the buildings to which they belonged were swept away to Rome Temples baths porticoes and other public places were first adorned The con∣quered provinces could not supply the demand Artists were called from Greece Parian mar∣ble was imported and statues were erected to the Gods and heroes of Rome as had been erected before to those of Greece  Italusque paterque Sabinus  Vitisator curvam servans sub imagine falcem  Saturnusque senex Janique bifrontis imago  Vestibulo adstabant aliique ab origine reges  Martia qui ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi  The rage for these beautiful ornaments next seized  private persons  Every one who had a consular or a praetorian ancestor wished to see him erected in brass or marble till at length it became as common in Rome to have a like∣ness taken by a statuary as it is in London to have one taken by a portrait painter Artists no doubt there were of all kinds and prices adapted to every rank The mechanic there∣fore as well as the senator might see his house  adorned with himself his wife and his family all sculptured to the life in stone Many of these ignoble statues might in length of time deposit their plebeian forms and visit foreign countries as Scipios Caesars and Octavias It is not every connoisseur who can detect them by their garb  From what has been observed we may easily judge what an inexhaustible fund of an∣tiques Rome and its colonies for the rage spread over all the neighbouring parts of Italy might produce Quantities no doubt of these works are still laid up in those magazines of ruin and rubbish which Goths and other bar∣barous invaders have heaped upon them  The statues busts and bassreliefs which we now survey were chiefly collected by the cardinals Mazarin and Richlieu and the Earl of Arundel in Charles the First's time Addi∣tions have been made since Some I have been told were presented by one of the Dukes of Tuscany to whom an Earl of Pembroke had shewn particular civilities during his stay in England The collection no doubt is very magnificent one of the first perhaps in Eu∣rope if we except royal and classic ground and many of its contents are excellent pieces of  art In general however they may be classed as Martial classes his epigrams into good bad and indifferent It is impossible that in so nu∣merous a collection the whole can be valuable In many of those however which are indiffer∣ent some of the parts may be good and afford useful studies  Among the busts which struck us most on the transient view we were able to give them were those of MiltiadesHannibalPindar AdrianCleopatra the sister of Alexander Lepidus Sophocles Pompey Nerva Labienus Parthicus Semiramis Marcellus the youngerMetellus imberbisDianaLu∣can CaracallaAlcibiadesCecropsVitel∣lius and Galba Pyrrhus of Epire is parti∣cularly fine The air of this bust is very noble and is impressed with the whole character of the hero A collossean bust too of Alexander the Great is striking but the head seems ra∣ther too long Probably it might be covered though I do not recollect the circumstance with a Grecian helmet If so the headpiece and visor connected without a joint when thrown back would make the head too long by the addition of the length of the face  Among the altorelievos we admired two CupidsCurtiusSaturnsome Boys eating grapesUlysses in the cave of CalypsoSa∣turn crowning the ArtsCupid sucking Venus The story of ClaeliaSilenus on his ass GalataeaCupids and BoysA Boy on a seahorseA Victory the composition of which is very goodA Priestess sacrificing in which the animals are particularly fineA Nuptial Vase both the form and sculpture of which are elegant  Among the statues we thought the best were A small Meleager An Amazonian Queen less than the life the attitude and ex∣pression of which are both excellentA dying Hercules part of this group is good particu∣larly the expression of Pean but the principal figure though in miniature is monstrous and the character is unpleasingA Colossean Her∣cules Saturn holding a ChildThe Father of Julius Caesar the attitude of this figure is very nobleMark Anthony the attitude of this too is admirableVenus holding a Vase this figure if looked at on the side opposite the vase is pleasing but on the other side it is awkward A Naiad the upper part of which is beau∣tifulApollo  in the Stonehall the body is better than the handsCleopatra and Caesarion are esteemed we did not see much merit in them There is at least no feminine beauty in Cleopatra The pillar too in the outward court may here be mentioned the whole of which has an elegant appearance and the statue is beautiful  It is not easy to avoid remarking that these antiques might possibly have been arranged in a more judicious manner The  apartments  of a noble house should not suffer their  ornaments  to obtrude  foremost  upon the eye Each apart∣ment should preserve its  own dignity  to which the  ornamental  part should be  subordinate  In every work of art and indeed of nature also it is a breach of the most express picturesque canon if the  parts  engage the eye more than the  whole  The hall therefore the staircase the saloon and other apartments might be adorned with a few busts and statues but to receive the whole collection perhaps a long gallery should have been  professedly  built In this they might have been arranged in  profusion  In constructing such a gallery little orna∣ment would be required Here the  statues  would be the objects not the  room  To  them  therefore the  whole  should be subordinate they would constitute the  whole  Two things in such a gallery should chiefly be considered the colour of the walls and the distribution of the light If the walls were stained with a darkish olivetint they would perhaps shew the statues to the best advantage and yet a lighter tinge might probably give them more softness The experiment might easily be tried  With regard to the  light  it should be high but not vertical If the antiques were ranged on one side of the room the light might be in∣troduced from high windows on the other Such a light would not certainly be the most picturesque as each figure at least when stu∣died would require a side light appropriated to itself But this in a degree might be ob∣tained by the means of curtains  Much of the beauty of such a room would depend on the mode of arranging the antiques The bassreliefs might be put in plain square frames and affixed to the wall the busts might stand on brackets between them or in recesses and the statues might occupy the  front Or perhaps on examining the whole collection together some more happy arrange∣ment might be formed  As nobody in England but the Earl of Pem∣broke could fit up such a gallery it should not perhaps be made entirely a private concern It would be generous and noble to lay it open to artists when well recommended and to let them study in it under proper restrictions It would bring Italy as much as could be into England  But statues are not the only furniture at Wilton it contains many very valuable pic∣tures  Those we admired most were  A Cattlepiece by Rosa of Tivoli Few masters are better acquainted with composition colouring and the distribution of light This picture though not a capital one is an instance of his skill in all these respects  A wholelength of the first Lady of the se∣cond Earl Philip and a halflength of the Countess of Castlehaven both these are by Vandyck and both are excellent  Mrs Kelligrew and Mrs Morton by Van∣dyck the latter we admired very much  Mr James Herbert by Lely  A Carpet and Boar'shead by Maltese The composition is a strange one but the picture is well painted  An old Woman with Fish by Snyders The fish are masterly but the composition is dis∣agreeable  An old Woman reading by Rembrant  Christ taken from the Cross by Albert Du∣rer They who admire the works of the old masters will find a very good one here  A large Fruitpiece with Figures by M An∣gelo delle Battaglio It is a tradition in the family that M Angelo kept this picture in his possession as a favourite piece and that Sir Robert Gere bought it of his widow for three hundred pistoles  Democritus by Spagnolet The style of painting in this picture is admirable but the character of Democritus is bad  Four Children by Rubens For composition and colouring we seldom see a more pleasing picture either by this master or any other  The Virgin with Christ by Cantarini The manner is indistinct but the boy is a beautiful figure  The division of Christ's Garments by Carracci This picture is well painted but the light is illmanaged  The Princess Sophia habited like a Shep∣herdess by Huntorst  A good Virgin by Carlo Dolce  An admirable portrait of Titian by himself  The Woman taken in Adultery by Janeiro The story is not well told but the figures are beautifully grouped  A good Schalken  An old Man selling Plumbs to Children by Francis Hals This is a happy subject to shew pleasure and disappointment in young faces and the painter has been as happy in his expression of them  In one of the rooms I remember meeting with a picture of Pietro Testa which is uncom∣mon There is great spirit in it  But the capital picture at Wilton is the large familypiece by Vandyck Of the excellence of this picture we are told many stories that it is Vandyck's masterpiece that it is celebrated through Europe and that it might have been covered with gold as a price to obtain it This latter is a compliment which I have often heard paid in great houses to favourite pictures and  as the King of France is supposed to be the richest man in Europe he is generally intro∣duced on these occasions as the bidder For myself I own I am not entirely of the King of France's opinion I have examined this pic∣ture with great attention and reluctantly own I cannot bring myself to admire it either in the  whole  or in its  parts  Vandyck's portrait of King Charles I over a chimney at Hamp∣ton Court  I believe it is now removed  which consists only of a single figure I freely own I should prefer to this though it consists of thirteen  Vandyck seldom appears to advantage when he has  several figures  to manage His master Rubens early saw this and desired him to re∣linquish history and apply to portrait He did but here he is again engaged in history that is he has a number of figures at full length to manage in one large piece which extends twenty feet by twelve The compo∣sition of such a work required more skill than he possessed  In the first place there is no attempt at  design  Some little familyscene should have been introduced which might have drawn the figures  into one action  Thus Titian represents  the Cornaro family joining in an act of devo∣tion  This picture belongs to the Duke of Northumberland  Without something of this kind the figures had better have been painted in  sepa∣rate pictures  Composition  too is wanting as well as  design  The figures are illgrouped and produce  no whole  The  colouring  too is glaring Yellow red and blue are the sources when  properly blended  of every harmonious tint but here they stare in raw colours Every gaudy figure stands foremost to catch the eye except the princi∣pal figures which are attired in black The young people are all so richly dressed that it seems as if their father and mother had ordered them to put on their best clothes and come down to be painted and that the painter had drawn them so attired just as he saw them without any distinction or choice of drapery To destroy the harmony still more a large es∣cutcheon of the Pembroke arms hangs in one corner of the picture filled with such a profu∣sion of red and yellow that it catches the eye at once and may properly be called one of the principal figures  If from a  general  view of the picture we proceed to  particulars  I fear our criticisms must  be equally severe Never painter it must be owned had that happy art which Vandyck possessed of turning earths and minerals into flesh and blood Never painter had that happy art of composing a single figure with the chaste simplicity of nature and without affectation or artifice of any kind and some of the figures in this picture are no doubt composed in this style particularly the Earls of Pembroke and Carnarvon But the figures in general when considered apart are far from capital Some of the attitudes are forced you look in vain for Vandyck's wonted simplicity But what disgusts us most is a want of harmony In all pictures whether the faces are old or young the  same coloured light  if I may so express myself should be spread over allthe mellow or the bluish tinge arising from the state of the atmos∣phere whatever it is through which the light is thrown upon them but here this rule is so far from being observed that even allowing the variation of different complexions the faces of all though of one country belong to different climates A yellowfaced boy parti∣cularly among the front figures has a com∣plexion which nothing but a jaundice or an Indian sun could have given him For the  rest some of the carnations are very beautiful particularly the hands of the Countess of Pem∣broke  All this censure however must not be laid to the charge of Vandyck His pencil could never have been guilty of such violence against Nature I have been assured  By the late Lord Orford  that about a dozen years ago this picture was retouched by a painter I think of the name of Brompton I saw it before that time and some years after and as far as my memory serves it was altered much for the worse This may account for most of the faults that may be found with the  carnations  It would have been a happy thought to re∣present the dead children by little cherubs ho∣vering in the air if the picture had had an  em∣blematical  cast In  serious portrait  the thought seems rather out of place  At Wiltonhouse the accomplished Sir Phi∣lip Sidney whose beloved sister was married to the Earl of Pembroke wrote his Arcadia a work of such fancy that although not accom∣modated to the refinement of this age it was greatly admired in the last and went rapidly through eight editions  SECT IX  FROM Wilton we returned to Salisbury and from thence proceeded to Fonthill the seat of Mr Beckford The road conveyed us through lanes along the edge of the plain About Denton the ground lay beautifully the hills descending gently on each side  Fonthill is a noble house situated in a park which contains great variety of ground It takes its name from a woody hill and fountain hard by it from which rises a stream that assists in forming an artificial river decorated by a very sumptuous bridge If the bridge had been more simple the scene about it would have been more pleasing The ground though  artificially formed slopes well  to the river on each side and beyond the bridge opens into a sweet retiring valley  Mr Beckford seems also to have been assi∣duous in making a collection of pictures and in point of numbers he has succeeded A So∣crates by Salvator is most esteemed But though a capital picture it seems illcoloured being a mere yellowish clair obscure nor has Socrates any character I must add however  that I have oftener than once judged falsely on the first sight of Salvator's pictures which have pleased me more on a second view This however is certainly a fault We expect from a good picture as from a good man a favour∣able impression at sight  But if there be few good pictures at Fonthill there is abundance of splendor not without a little dash of vanity and ostentation What is wanting in taste is made up in finery Never house was so bedecked with all the pride of up∣holstery The very plateglass in one room cost fifteen hundred pounds  Since this was written I have been informed that Fonthill hath been much improved particularly that a cathedral hath been built of the full dimensions of a genuine one As Mr Wyatt was the architect it must be a noble edifice and if it be properly stationed it must be a grand decoration    From Fonthill we proceeded through Hen∣don to Stourhead the seat of Mr Hoare along downs overlooking an extensive distance on the left We soon came in sight of the house and plantations adorned with towers stretch∣ing in a line along the horizon The planta∣tions which seemed to stand on a flat ap∣peared in this distant view very regular and  gave us but an unfavourable idea of the place The mystery however of this apparently un∣pleasing situation was unravelled when we came upon the spot  Mr Hoare purchased Stourhead about forty years ago of Lord Stourton who takes his title from a village of that name in the neigh∣bourhood The improved grounds consist of three parallel vallies all of them closed at one end by an immense terrace running several miles in length with little deviation either to the right or left This was the horizontal stretch of unpleasing ground which we saw at a distance The vallies run from it nearly at right angles and were entirely skreened from the eye as we approached  But though Mr Hoare has taken all the three vallies consisting of several miles in cir∣cumference within his improvements he has  adorned  that only which lies nearest his house The other two are planted and cut into rides but the wood is yet young  The house is built on an elegant design by Colin Campbell the architect of Wansteadhouse in Essex It consists of a basement one grand floor and an attic We enter a handsome hall and pass into the saloon which  is a noble room sixty feet in length On each side of these rooms range the apartments  Several good pictures adorn them Those we admired most were  Some Market peasants by Gainsborough Both the figures and the effect of this picture are pleasing  The Conference between Jacob and Esau by Rosa of Tivoli This is a capital picture and abounds with amusement though it is neither painted in the master's best manner nor are the figures wellgrouped  A small landscape by Lucatelli  A Holy Family by Caracci  A landscape by Rembrandt The back∣ground and sky are dark and the figures sit∣ting on the foreground and seen by firelight have a good effect  A Baptist's Head in a Charger by Carlo Dolci  A good copy of Reuben's Boys at Wilton  Elisha restoring the Widow's Son by Rem∣brandt This is esteemed the most capital pic∣ture of the collection but it wants a  whole  and the prophet a  character  From the house we went to view the im∣provements around it That valley near which  the house stands and which I have mentioned as the most adorned contains a very noble scene It is called the valley of  Sixwells  from six heads of the river Stour which arise here and which the Stourton family take for their arms The produce of these springs is col∣lected into a grand piece of water in which and the improvements on its banks consist the beauties of the scene  In the common round we are carried first to the lower parts along the margin of the lake which we cross in a narrow part by a su∣perb wooden bridge and still continuing along the water are amused with a grotto which has more propriety in it than these places com∣monly have Here arises one of the heads of the Stour which a wellcut river God Deus ipse loci pours from his urn  There is another grotto also near this in which the springs are collected into a marble bath It is adorned with the statue of a sleep∣ing nymph under whom you read these lines  Nymph of the grot these sacred streams I keep  And to the murmur of these waters sleep  Ah spare my slumbers gently tread the cave  And drink in silence or in silence lave  Leaving these grottos we ascend the higher grounds and so proceed from one ornamental building to another every where entertained with different views of the lake and its banks  One of these buildings is very beautiful It is called the Pantheon as it is built on some∣thing like the model of the Pantheon at Rome Though it is only the  ornament of a garden  it is a  splendid edifice  The rotunda which is the grand part of it is lighted from the top and is thirtysix feet in diameter To this is added a portico and an apartment on each side The inside of the rotunda is adorned with statues and basrelievos and in the centre stands an excellent Hercules by Rysbrach  This statue was the work of emulation Rysbrach had long enjoyed the public favour without a rival Schemaker first arose as a competitor and afterwards Rubiliac both artists of great merit the latter of uncommon abilities Rysbrach piqued at seeing the ap∣plause of the public divided executed this sta∣tue as a proof of his skill He composed it from the selected limbs of six or seven of the heroes of Broughton's amphitheatre a scene  of diversion at that time in high repute The brawny arms were taken from that chief him∣self the chest from the  coachman  a champion well known in his day by that appellation and the legs from Ellis the painter who took more delight in Broughton's amphitheatre than in his own paintingroom  Having finished our circuit round the gar∣den we were on the whole much pleased There is a greatness in the  design  though some∣times a littleness in the  execution  The build∣ings in general are good but they are too nu∣merous and too sumptuous The giltcross is a very disgusting object Indeed simplicity is every where too much wanting Many of the open∣ings also are forced and the banks of the lake in some places formal the paths are mere zig∣zags the going off of the water and all the ma∣nagement about the head of the lake which is always a business difficult to manage is awk∣ward and perplexed and as to the grounds near the house they are still in the old style of avenues and vistas We saw many things at the same time which pleased us particularly the  line of the lake  in general along its shores the woody skreens that environed it and the  effect of some of the buildings in the landscape  when seen single  especially that of the Pan∣theon On the whole we spent an agreeable summer evening at Stourhead and found more amusement than we generally find in places so highly adorned  The next morning we visited the more dis∣tant parts of Mr Hoare's improvements the other two vallies and the terrace The vallies will be more beautiful as the woods improve at present they are but unfurnished and yet in their naked state we saw more clearly the pecu∣liarity of the ground Three vallies thus closed by an immense terrace is a singular production of nature Some parts of the terrace command a most extensive distance At the point of it where it falls into the lower ground a trian∣gular tower is erected for the sake of the view Over the door is the figure of King Alfred with this inscription  In Memory of Alfred the Great  Who on this summit  Erected his Standard  Against Danish Invaders  He instituted Juries  Established a Militia  Created and exerted  A Naval Force  A Philosopher and a Christian  The Father of his People  The Founder  Of the English Monarchy  And of Liberty  From the tower of Alfred we returned to Stourhead after a ride of at least eight miles through the different parts of Mr Hoare's plantations  SECT X  FROM Stourhead to Froom we passed through an inclosed country which is barren of amusement On our right we left MaidenBradley an old house belonging to the Duke of Somerset and went a few miles out of our road to see Longleat the mansion of Lord Weymouth  Longleat is a noble old fabric the work∣manship of John Padua about the year This architect was much esteemed by the Pro∣tector Somerset whose house in the Strand he built Sir John Thyn who employed him here was one of the Protector's principal offi∣cers The style however of Longleat has more a cast of the Gothic than that of Somer∣setHouse which makes a nearer approach to Grecian architecture  SomersetHouse in the Strand is now pulled down and an expensive edifice for various offices erected in its room  Neither possesses enough of its respective style to be beautiful in its kind The Gothic style perhaps at best is but ill adapted to private buildings We  chiefly admire it when its clustered pillars adorn the walls of some cathedral when its pointed ribs spread along the roof of an aisle or when the tracery of a window occupies the whole end of a choir Gothic ornaments in this style of magnificence lose their littleness They are not considered as  parts  but are lost in  one vast whole  and contribute only to im∣press a  general  idea of richness  We sometimes indeed see the  smaller appen∣dages  of cathedrals decorated very beautifully in the Gothic style as the chapterhouse at Salisbury and that most elegant building at Ely called the  Parishchurcb  But in these buildings the  proportions  chiefly fill the eye for which such ornaments are contrived as have a good effect Ornaments of this kind I have never seen used in any  private house  of Gothic construction Nor indeed are they proper As they are only found in sacred buildings it might perhaps have been esteemed a mode of profaneness to adopt them in pri∣vate structures This idea indeed the Gothic architects themselves seem to have had by never using them but in churches  On the whole the Grecian architecture seems much better adapted to a private dwell∣inghouse  than the Gothic It has a better  assortment  if I may so speak of proper orna∣ments and proportions for all its purposes The Gothic ornaments might dress up a hall or a saloon but they could do little more we should find it difficult to decorate the flat roof of an apartment with them or a passage or a staircase  Nor are the  conveniencies  which the Grecian architecture bestows on  private buildings  less considerable than the beauty of its  decorations  The Gothic palace is an  incumbered  pile We are amused with looking into these mansions of antiquity as objects of curiosity but should never think of comparing them in point of convenience with the great houses of modern taste in which the hall and the saloon fill the eye on our entrance are noble reservoirs for air and grand antichambers to the several rooms of state that divide on each hand from them  Longleat has nothing of the Grecian gran∣deur to recommend it It is a large square building with a court in the middle which is intended to enlighten the inner chambers The whole is certainly a grand pile but it has little beauty and I should suppose less conve∣nience  It is at present however exceedingly in dishabille and the furniture seems to be the relics of the last century The family of the Thynnes cover the walls in great profusion We rarely see so numerous a collection of por∣traits without one that is able to fix the eye  Be the inside of the house and its contents however what they may when we view it seated as it is in the centre of a noble park which slopes down to it in all directions itself a grand object evidently the capital of these wide domains it has certainly a very princely appearance  Somewhere among the woods of this man∣sion was first naturalized the Weymouthpine This species of pine is among the most formal of its brotherhood and yet the planter must consider it in point of variety as an acquisition The patriarchpine Mr Walpole tells us still exists but we did not see it  SECT XI  FROM Longleat we pursued our road through Froom to Wells The first part of our journey presented nothing very inte∣resting As we approached Mendiphills the road divides one branch leading  over  those high grounds the other  under  them We chose the latter which afforded us on the right those hills for a background and on the left an extensive distance in which Glastonbury∣tor as it is called is the most conspicuous fea∣ture  Our approach to Wells from the  natural  and  incidental  beauties of the scene was un∣commonly picturesque It was a hazy even∣ing and the sun declining low was hid be∣hind a deep purple cloud which covered half the hemisphere but did not reach the western horizon Its lower skirts were gilt with daz∣zling splendor which spread downwards not in diverging rays but in one uniform ruddy glow and uniting at the bottom with the  mistiness of the air formed a rich yet modest tint with which Durcotehill projecting boldly on the left the towers of Wells beyond it and all the objects of the distance were tinged while the foreground seen against so bright a piece of scenery was overspread with the darkest shades of evening The whole toge∣ther invited the pencil without soliciting the imagination But it was a transitory scene As we stood gazing at it the sun sunk below the cloud and being stripped of all its splendor by the haziness of the atmosphere fell like a ball of fire into the horizon and the whole radiant vision faded away  Wells is a pleasant town and agreeably situ∣ated The cathedral is a beautiful pile not∣withstanding it is of Saxon architecture The front is exceedingly rich and yet the parts are large In the towers the upper stories are plain and make a good contrast with the rich∣ness of the lower But this circumstance ap∣pears to most advantage when the towers are seen in profile in front there is too much or∣nament In the inside the Saxon heaviness prevails more The choirpart is in better taste and the retiring pillars of the chapel be∣yond  the communiontable produce an un∣usual and very pleasing effect like that at Sa∣lisbury The chapterhouse is an elegant octa∣gon supported by a single pillar One of the parish churches also at Wells is adorned with a very handsome Gothic tower and is itself a beautiful pile  Near Wells is a famous cavern called Okeyhole It lies under Mendiphills which in this place form a beautiful recess adorned with rock and wood A recess of this kind appears of little value to those who are acquainted with mountainous countries but in the south of England it is a novel scene As to the cavern itself it runs about three hundred yards under ground dividing into three large apartments But no cavern that I know except that at Castleton in Derbyshire  See an account of it in Mr G's Northern Tour vol ii p  is worth visiting in a picturesque light Caverns in general are mere holes and have no connection with the ground about them That at Castleton has a grand entrance and the rocky scenery with which it is hung forms a most magnificent approach But in the cavern here there is no  grandeur of this kind so that it contributes little to the beauty of the recess in which it lies  From Okeyhole we returned to Wells and from thence proceeded to Glastonbury the ruins of which had highly raised our expect∣ation  SECT XII  THE ground on which the abbey of Glas∣tonbury stands is higher than the neigh∣bouring district which is a perfect flat inso∣much that tradition says it was formerly co∣vered with the sea If that was the case the ground which the abbey occupies if not an island was at least a peninsula To this day it bears the name of  the Isle of Avelon  and the meadows around it seem plainly to have been washed and relinquished by the sea  The abbey of Glastonbury therefore does not enjoy that choice situation which the ge∣nerality of religious houses possess  Original foundations  like this were generally fixed by accidental causes An escape from a shipwreck a battle a murder the scene of some prince's death with a variety of other circumstances have commonly determined their site so that if they enjoy a good situation it seems to be accidental Those religious houses whose situ∣ation we particularly admire I should conjec∣ture have been chiefly colonies or offsets  from the great religious houses In  these  there might be a  choice of situation  The event which settled the situation of this abbey is firmly attested on the proof of Romish legends When Joseph of Arema∣thea came to preach the Gospel in Britain as it is asserted he did he landed on the Isle of Avelon and fixing his staff in the ground a dry thornsaplin which had been his companion through all the countries he had passed fell asleep When he awoke he found to his great surprise that his staff had taken root and was covered with white blossoms From this miracle however he drew a very natural conclusion that as the use of his staff was thus taken from him it was ordained that he should fix his abode in this place Here therefore he built a chapel which by the piety of succeeding times increased into this magni∣ficent foundation  Of this immense fabric nothing now remains but a part of the  great church St Joseph's chapel  an  old gateway  part of the  abbot's lodge  and the  kitchen  Of the  great church  the south side is nearly entire some part of the east end remains a little of the cross isle and a remnant of the tower  all of the purest and most elegant Gothic The north side was lately taken down and the materials were applied to build a meetinghouse From this defalcation however the ruin as a picturesque object seems to have suffered little In  correspondent  parts if one only be taken away or considerably fractured it may possibly be an advantage But we greatly regret the loss of the west end which was taken down to build a townhall Still more we regret the loss of the tower as the eye wants some elevated part to give an apex to the whole Besides in that part of the tower which remains there is rather a form∣ality Two similar points which have been the shoulders of a Gothic arch arise in equal dimensions and do not easily fall into a pic∣turesque form  St Joseph's chapel  which stands near the west end of the great church is almost entire The roof indeed is gone but the walls have suffered little dilapidation This chapel was probably more ancient than the church as it has evidently a mixture in it of Saxon archi∣tecture but the style is very pure in its kind and the whole is rich and beautiful It is no little addition to its beauty that ivy is spread  about over the walls in such just proportion as to adorn without defacing them  On the southwest of St Joseph's chapel stands the  Gate of strangers  which seems to have been a heavy building void of elegance and beauty Not far from the Gate of strangers and connected with it in design are shewn the foundations of the Linguist's lodge but no part of it unless it be a postern is now left This was a very necessary part of an endow∣ment which was visited by strangers from all parts of the world  The  Abbot's lodge  has been a large building It ranges parallel with the south side of the church and was nearly entire within the me∣mory of man It was a suit of seven apart∣ments on a floor but very little of it is now left In the year it was taken down to answer some purpose of economy though it seems never to have been a structure of any beauty  Hard by the Abbot's lodge stands the  Kitchen  which is to this day very entire and is both a curious remnant of antiquity and a noble mo∣nument of monkish hospitality It is a square building calculated to last for ages Its walls are four feet thick and yet strengthened with  massy buttresses They have indeed an im∣mense roof to support which is still in excel∣lent repair It is constructed of stone and seems to be a work of very curious masonry running up in the form of an octagonal pyra∣mid and finished at the top in a double cupola The under part of this cupola received the smoke in channels along the inside of the roof and the upper part contained a bell which first called the society to dinner and afterwards the neighbouring poor to alms The inside of the Kitchen is an octagon four chimnies taking off the corners of the square It has two doors and measures twentytwo feet from one to the other and a hundred and seventy from the bottom to the top In this Kitchen it is re∣corded that twelve oxen were dressed gene∣rally every week besides a proportional quan∣tity of other victuals  These are all the visible remains of this great house Foundations are traced far and wide where it is conjectured the cloisters ran the monks cells the schools the dormitories halls and other offices The whole together has been an amazing combination of various build∣ings It had the appearance indeed of a consider∣able town containing perhaps the largest so∣ciety  under one government and the most ex∣tensive foundation that ever appeared in Eng∣land in any form Its fraternity is said to have consisted of five hundred established monks besides nearly as many retainers on the abbey Above four hundred children were not only educated in it but entirely maintained Stran∣gers from all parts of Europe were liberally re∣ceived classed according to their sex and na∣tion and might consider the hospitable roof under which they lodged as their own Five hundred travellers with their horses though they generally I should suppose travelled on foot have been lodged at once within its walls While the poor from every side of the country waited the ringing of the almsbell when they flocked in crowds young and old to the gate of the monastery where they received every morning a plentiful provision for themselves and their families all this appears great and noble  On the other hand when we consider five hundred persons bred up in indolence and lost to the commonwealth when we consider that these houses were the great nurseries of superstition bigotry and ignorance the stews of sloth stupidity and perhaps intemperance when we consider that the education received  in them had not the least tincture of useful learning good manners or true religion but tended rather to vilify and disgrace the human mind when we consider that the pilgrims and strangers who resorted thither were idle vaga∣bonds who got nothing abroad that was equi∣valent to the occupations they left at home and when we consider lastly that indiscrimi∣nate almsgiving is not real charity but an avocation from labour and industry checking every idea of exertion and filling the mind with abject notions we are led to acquiesce in the fate of these great foundations and view their ruins not only with a picturesque eye but with moral and religious satisfaction  This great house possessed the amplest reve∣nues of any religious house in England Its ancient domains are supposed  now  to yield not less than an annual income of two hundred thousand pounds I have heard them calcu∣lated at much more  Within a mile of the abbey stands the  Torr  which is by much the highest land in the island of Avelon and had been our landmark through an approach of many leagues The summit of this hill is decorated with a ruin which has its effect though in itself it possesses  no beauty It is a structure of ambiguous in∣tention One tradition supposes it to have been a seamark for which it is well adapted Another makes it an oratory To the abbot it certainly belonged  Here the holy man when Satan led him aside might sometimes ascend and looking round him might see all the country his own houses and villages filled with his vassals mea∣dows covered with innumerable flocks and herds to support the strength of his table rivers and woods abounding with fish and game to furnish its delicacies fields waving with corn to fill his granaries and his cellars and among other sources of luxury no fewer than seven ample parks well stocked with ve∣nison Here was a glorious view indeed His heart might dilate as the vision expanded and if he were not well upon his guard he might easily have mistaken an earthly reverie for holy joy and religious gratitude  Near the bottom of this hill are found great quantities of that species of putrefaction which resembles a coiled serpent or as it is often called an  Ammon's horn  The ruins of Glastonburyabbey occupy a piece of ground about a mile in circumfe∣rence  which has no peculiar beauty but might be improved into a very grand scene if it were judiciously planted and laid out with just so much art as to discover the ruins to the best advantage But such schemes of improvement are calculated only for posterity A young plantation would ill accord with such antique accompaniments The oak would require at least a century's growth before its mossgrown limbs could be congenial with the ruins it adorned  I should ill deserve the favours I met with from the learned antiquarian who has the care of these ruins though he occupies only the humble craft of a shoemaker if I did not at∣tempt to do some justice to his zeal and piety No picturesque eye could more admire these venerable remains for their beauty than he did for their sanctity Every stone was the object of his devotion But above all the appendages of Glastonbury he reverenced most the famous thorn which sprang from St Joseph's staff and blossoms at Christmas On this occasion he gave us the following relation  It was at that time he said when the King resolved to alter the common course of the year that he first felt distress for the honour of  the house of Glastonbury If the time of Christmas were changed who could tell how the credit of this miraculous plant might be af∣fected In short with the fortitude of a Jewish seer he ventured to expostulate with the King upon the subject and informed his Majesty in a letter of the disgrace that might possibly ensue if he persisted in his design of altering the natural course of the year But though his conscience urged him upon this bold action he could not but own the flesh trembled He had not the least doubt he said but the King would immediately send down an order to have him hanged He pointed to the spot where the last abbot of Glastonbury was executed for not surrendering his abbey and he gave us to understand there were men now alive who could suffer death in a good cause with equal fortitude His zeal however was not put to this severe trial The King was more merciful than he expected for though his Majesty did not follow his advice it never appeared that he took the least offence at the freedom of his letter  The death of the last abbot of Glastonbury is indeed a mournful tale as it is represented by the writers of those times and was cal∣culated  to make a lasting impression on the country  This abbot is said to have been a pious and good man careful of his charge kind to the poor and exemplary in his conduct He is particularly mentioned as a man of great tem∣perance which in a cloister was not per∣haps at that day the reigning virtue What was still as uncommon he was a lover of learn∣ing and not only took great care of the edu∣cation of those young men who were brought up in his house but was at the expence of maintaining several of them at the univer∣sities He was now very old and very in∣firm and having passed all his life in his mo∣nastery knew little more of the world than he had seen within its walls  It was the misfortune of this good abbot to live in the tyrannical days of Henry VIII and at that period when the suppression of monasteries was his favourite object Henry had applied to many of the abbots and by threats and promises had engaged several of them to surrender their trusts But the abbot of Glastonbury attached to his house and connected with his fra∣ternity refused to surrender He was consci∣ous of his own innocence and thought guilt  only had to fear from the inquisition that was abroad But Henry whose haughty and im∣perious spirit unused to control soared above the trifling distinctions between innocence and guilt was highly incensed and determined to make an example of the abbot of Glastonbury to terrify others An order first came down for him to appear forthwith before the council The difficulties of taking so long a journey appeared great to an old man who had seldom travelled beyond the limits of his monastery But as there was no redress he got into an easy horselitter and set out In his mode of travelling we see the state and dignity which certainly required some correction of the great ecclesiastics of that age His retinue it is said consisted of not fewer than an hundred and fifty horsemen  The King's sending for him however was a mere pretext The real purpose was to pre∣vent his secreting his effects as it was never intended that he should return Proper per∣sons therefore were commissioned to search his apartments in his absence and secure the wealth of the monastery His steward in the mean∣time who was a gentleman of the degree of a Knight was corrupted to make what discoveries he  could It was an easy matter in those days to procure evidence where it was already deter∣mined to convict In one of the abbot's cabi∣nets some strictures upon the divorce were either found or pretended to be found No∣thing else could be obtained against him  During this interval the abbot who knew nothing of these proceedings waited on the council He was treated respectfully and in∣formed that the King would not  force  any man to do what he wished him to  do freely  However as his Majesty intended to receive his final determination on the spot he was at liberty to return  Being thus dismissed the abbot thought all was now over and that he might be permitted to end his days peaceably in his beloved mo∣nastery  He was now nearly at the end of his jour∣ney having arrived at Wells which is within five miles of Glastonbury when he was in∣formed that a countycourt of what kind is not specified was convened there on that day to which he as abbot of Glastonbury was summoned He went into the court room ac∣cordingly and as his station required was going to take his place at the upper end of it among  the principal gentry of the country when the crier called him to the bar where he was ac∣cused of high treason  The old man who had not the least con∣ception of the affair was utterly astonished and turning to his steward who stood near him asked if he knew what could be the meaning of all this That traitor whispering in his ear wished him not to be cast down for he knew the meaning of it was only to ter∣rify him into a compliance Though the court therefore on the evidence of the paper taken out of his cabinet found him guilty of high treason he had still no idea of what was intended From the court he was conveyed to his litter and conducted to Glastonbury still in suspence how all this would end  When he arrived under the walls of his abbey the litter was ordered to stop and an officer riding up to him bad him prepare for instant death A priest at the same time pre∣sented himself to take his confession  The poor old abbot utterly confounded at the suddenness of the thing was quite unman∣ned He begged with tears and for God's sake they would allow him some little time for recollection But his tears were vain  Might he not then just enter his monastery take leave of his friends and recommend him∣self to their prayers All was to no purpose He was dragged out of his litter and laid upon a hurdle to which a horse being yoked he was drawn along the ground to the Torr and there to make the triumph complete was hung up in his monk's habit and in sight of his monastery It was a triumph however that was attended with the tears and lamenta∣tions of the whole country which had long considered this pious man as a friend bene∣factor and father  How far this shocking story in all its cir∣cumstances of strange precipitancy and wanton cruelty may be depended on considering the hands through which it is conveyed may be matter of doubt thus much however is cer∣tain that if the picture here given of the royal savage of those days be not an exact portrait it bears evidently a striking resemblance  SECT XIII  HAVING given a last look at the pictu∣resque ruins of Glastonbury we left them with regret That pure style of Gothic in which this grand house was composed it is probable gave the keytone in architecture to all the churches in this neighbourhood for it is certain a better taste prevails among them as far as we observed than in any other part of England through which we had travelled  From Glastonbury we took the road to Bridgewater and passed through a very fine country  About three miles beyond Piper's Inn we mounted a grand natural terrace called the heights of Pontic  On the right we had the whole range of Mendip hills which though inconsiderable in themselves made some figure in this view with pleasant savannahs stretching among them Beyond the hills appeared the sea and the island of Steepholms The nearer grounds between this distance and the eye were filled  with ample woods which ranged not in patches here and there dispersed but in one extended surface of tufted foliage for we saw little more from the heights on which we stood than the varied tops of the woods beneath us The whole country I believe is a scene of culti∣vation and the woods little more in fact than hedgerows But one row succeeding another the intermediate spaces are concealed together with all the regularity of that mode of plant∣ing and the whole appears in the distance as one vast bed of foliage  On the left we had the same kind of coun∣try only the hills on this side of Pontic are much superior to those of Mendip on the other Among the savannahs on this side shoot the extensive plains of Sedgmore which stretch far and wide before the eye Here the unfor∣tunate Monmouth tried his cause with his uncle James and all the country was after∣wards the scene of those acts of brutality which Kirk and Jefferies committed and which are still remembered with horror and detestation  This vast distance which we surveyed from the heights of Pontic not only filled the eye with its grandeur as a whole but was every where interspersed with amusing objects which  adorned its several divisions In one part Lord Chatham's obelisk pointed out the do∣mains of Pynsent In another part we were told the rich scenes before us were the woods of Sir Charles Tint The tall spire which arose on the right belonged to the great church at Bridgewater and the several little spots of water glittering under the sunbeams were reaches of the river Parret  Inlaying as with moltonglass the vale  That spread beyond the sight  At the distance at which we stood we could not well unite all these bright spots of the river into a winding course but the imagination easily traced the union  The distances indeed from the heights of Pontic are both grand and picturesque pic∣turesque when thus reduced into parts though in their immensity greatly too extensive for painting The whole scene was a translation of a passage in Virgil bringing before our eyes  Mare velivolum terrasque jacentes  Littoraque et latos populos  We have the same view elsewhere  From the mountain's ridge  O'er tufted tops of intervening woods  Regions on regions blended in the clouds  I cannot forbear contrasting this grand view with a few bold strokes of distance which Moses gives us when he tells us  he went up from the plains of Moab to the top of Pis∣gah from whence the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead unto Dan and all Naph∣tali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all the land of Judah unto the utmost sea and on the south the plain of the valley of Jericho unto Zoar  On Mr Hoare's terrace we had seen the spot where Alfred the Great mustered his scat∣tered troops to oppose the Danes The coun∣try near Bridgewater affords a scene where on another occasion he appeared in a different character  Where the Thone and the Parret join their waters they form between them a piece of ground containing about two acres which is called the Isle of Athelney In Saxon times it was not only surrounded by water but with woods and marshes to a great extent and was in every part of very difficult access Here the gallant Alfred retired in his distresses when he fled before the Danes after the battle of Wilton At first he considered it only as a place of refuge and sustained himself by shoot∣ing  the wild deer with his arrows But by degrees getting together a few of his friends he fortified the island and particularly the only avenue that led to it From hence he often made successful inroads upon the Danish quar∣ters and retreating among the marshes eluded pursuit From hence too in the habit of a minstrel he made that celebrated excursion to their camp in which under the pretence of amusing them with his songs and buffooneries he took an exact survey of their situation He then laid his measures so judiciously and fell upon them with so much welldirected fury that he entirely broke their power during the remainder of his reign In aftertimes when success had crowned his enterprizes he founded a monastery in the island in memory of the protection it had once afforded him But its site which had nothing to recommend it ex∣cept this personal circumstance was in all re∣spects so inconvenient that it never flourished though it existed till the times of the disso∣lution  SECT XIV  THERE is very little in Bridgewater which was our next stage worth a tra∣veller's attention Its great boast is the cele∣brated Blake one of Cromwell's admirals who was born in this town and represented it in se∣veral parliaments  The name of Blake can hardly occur to an Englishman without suggesting respect If ever any man was a  lover of his country  with∣out being actuated by  party  or  any other sinister motive  it was Blake Whether in a divided commonwealth one side or the other should be  cordially chosen  by every citizen is a nice ques∣tion Some of the ancient moralists have held the affirmative But a man may see such errors on both sides as may render a choice difficult This seems to have been Blake's case The  glory of his country  therefore was the only part he espoused He fought indeed under Cromwell but it was merely he would say to  aggrandize Old England  He often dis∣liked the protector's politics With the death  of Charles he was particularly displeased and was heard to mutter that to have saved the King's life he would freely have ventured his own But still he fought on took an im∣mense treasure from the Portuguese beat the Dutch in two or three desperate engagements burnt the Dey of Tunis's fleet awed the pira∣tical States and above all destroyed the Spa∣nish platefleet in the harbour of Santa Cruz which was thought a piece of the most gallant seamanship that  ever  was performed Some things in the mean time happened at home which he did not like particularly Cromwell's treatment of the Parliament but he still fought on and would say to his captains  It is not for us to mind state matters but to keep foreigners from fooling us  What is singular in this com∣mander is that all his knowledge in maritime affairs was acquired after he was fifty years of age He had the theory of his profession as it were by intuition and crowded as many gallant actions into nine or ten years as might have immortalized as many commanders One personal singularity is recorded which gives us a sort of portrait of him When his choler was raised and he was bent on some desperate undertaking it was his custom to twirl his whis∣kers  with his forefinger Whenever that sign appeared those about him well knew some∣thing dreadful was in agitation  Such a  peculiarity  however could not easily be made intelligible in a picture and therefore it is more proper for  history  than  representation  And yet I can conceive a portrait of Blake in this attitude if well managed to have a good effect His fleet might lie in the offing ready to sail At a distance might stand a castle which he meant to attack firing at his fleet and involved in smoke Blake with a few of his officers around him might stand on the foreground occupying the principal part of the picture and ready to embark in a boat which was waiting for them on the strand Blake himself might be represented in the atti∣tude above described throwing a dreadful look at the castle but this dreadful look must be in the hands of a master or it will infallibly become grotesque and caricature After all though this disposition might make a good picture I know not that it would be intelli∣gible enough to make a good portrait  All this coast between Bridgewater and Bristol is low and subject in many parts to overflowing tides In the memorable storm  of November it was a melancholy scene The sea broke over it with great outrage and did surprising damage In many places as you travel through it you see marks set up by the country people to show how far the sea poured in at that time But indeed every part of the Bristol channel is subject to very high tides at all times In Bridgewaterriver it often rises in an uncommon manner and comes forward in such rapid swells that it has been known sometimes to overset ships It affects the river at Bristol also and all the rivers on the coast and if I am not mistaken on the opposite coast likewise  SECT XV  AS we left Bridgewater we drew nearer the sea In our way we passed Sir Charles Tint's plantations which we had before seen as parts of a distance They appeared now stretching to a great extent along the side of a hill and beautifully interspersed with lawns They were adorned with too many buildings which would however have had a better effect if they had not been painted white A seat or small building painted white may be an ad∣vantage in a view but when these white spots are multiplied the distinction of their colour detaches them from the other objects of the scene with which they ought to combine they distract the eye and become separate spots instead of parts of a whole  In the neighbourhood of Sir Charles Tint's lies Enmorecastle the seat of Lord Egmont It is a new building in the form of an old castle A dry ditch surrounds it which you  pass by a drawbridge This carries you into a square court the four sides of which are oc∣cupied by the apartments It is called whim∣sical and no doubt there is something whim∣sical in the idea of a man's inclosing himself in the reign of George the Second in a fortress that would have suited the times of King Ste∣phen But if we can divest ourselves of this idea Enmorecastle seems to be a comfortable dwelling in which there is contrivance and convenience The situation of the stables seems the most whimsical You enter them through a subterraneous passage on the right of the great gate There was no occasion to carry the idea so far as to lock up the horses within the castle If the stables had been placed at some convenient distance nobody who should even examine the castle under its antique idea would observe the impropriety while the inconvenience as they are placed at present is evident to every one who sees them  But if the house be well contrived within it is certainly no picturesque object without The towers which occupy the corners and middle of the curtains are all of equal height which gives the whole an unpleasing  appearance If the tower at the entrance had been more elevated with a watchhouse at the top in the manner of some old castles the re∣gularity might still have been observed and the perspective in every point except exactly in the front would have given the whole a more pleasing form  But even with this addition Enmorecastle would be in a picturesque light only a very indifferent copy of its original The old baronial castle in its ancient state even before it had received from time the beau∣ties of ruin was certainly a more pleasing object than we have in this imitation of it The  form  of Enmore is sacrificed to  conveni∣ence  To make the apartments regular within the walls are regular without Whereas our ancestors had no idea of uniformity If one tower was square and low the other perhaps would be round and lofty The curtain too was irregular following the declivity or pro∣jection of the hill on which it stood It was adorned also with watchtowers here and there at unequal distances Nor were the windows more regular either in form or situation than the internal parts of the castle which they en∣lightened Some jutting corner of a detached  hill was also probably fortified with a project∣ing tower A large buttress or two perhaps propped the wall in some part where the at∣tack of an enemy had made it weak while the  keep  rising above the castle formed gene∣rally a grand apex to the whole Amidst all this mass of irregularity the lines would be broken the light often beautifully received and vari∣ous points of view presented some of which would be exceedingly picturesque Whereas En∣morecastle seen in every point of view pre∣sents a face of  unvaried sameness  Even taken in perspective it affords no variety We see three similar towers with two similar curtains between them on one side and three similar towers with two similar curtains between them on the other On the whole therefore as it obtains no  particular convenience  from its castleform and evidently no  particular beauty  it might perhaps have been as well if the no∣ble founder had built like other people on a modern plan  SECT XVI  FROM Enmorecastle we ascended Quantochills Our views from the heights of Pon∣tic were chiefly  inland  but from the high grounds here as we now approached the sea we were entertained with beautiful coastviews which make a very agreable species of land∣scape  The first scene of this kind was composed of Bridgewaterbay and the land around it We saw indeed the two islands of Flatholms and Steepholms and the Welsh coast beyond them but they were wrapped in the ambiguity of a hazy atmosphere which was of no ad∣vantage to the view Haziness has often a good effect in a picturesque scene The variety of objects shapes and hues which compose an extensive landscape though inharmonious in themselves may be harmoniously united by one general tinge spread over them But here the land bore so small a proportion to the water that as we could not have a  picture  and ex∣pected only  amusement  we wished for more dis∣tinctness  We had it soon for before we left our station a light breeze arising from the west swept away the vapours the distant coast became distinct and many a little white sail appeared in different parts of the channel which had been lost before in obscurity  The  going off  of mists and fogs is among the most beautiful circumstances belonging to them While the obscurity is only  partially  clearing away it often occasions a pleasing contrast be∣tween the  formed  and  unformed  parts of a land∣scape and like cleaning a dirty picture pleases the eye with seeing one part after another emerge into brightness It has its effect also when it goes off more suddenly  The exhibition we just had of the fog's leav∣ing the Welch coast was a  pleasing  one but where there is a  coincidence of grand ob∣jects under such circumstances  the exhibition is often  sublime  One of the grandest I remember to have met with was presented at the late siege of Gibraltar  See Drinkwater's Journal    It was near daybreak on the th of April when a message was brought from the  signalhouse at the summit of the rock that the long expected fleet under Admiral Darby was in sight Innumerable masts were just dis∣cerned from that lofty situation but could not be seen from the lower parts of the castle being obscured by a thick fog which had set in from the west and totally overspread the opening of the straits In this uncertainty the garrison remained some time while the fleet invested in obscurity moved slowly towards the castle In the mean time the sun becoming powerful the fog rose like the curtain of a vast theatre and discovered  at once  the whole fleet full and distinct before the eye The convoy consist∣ing of near a hundred vessels were in a com∣pact body led on by twentyeight sail of the line and a number of tenders and other smaller vessels A gentle wind just filled their sails and brought them forward with a slow and solemn motion Had all this grand exhibition been presented  gradually  the sublimity of it would have been injured by the acquaintance the eye would have made with it during its approach but the appearance of it in all its greatness  at once  before the eye had examined the detail had a wonderful effect  To this account of a grand effect from the clearing away of a fog I shall subjoin another which though of the horrid kind is grand and sublime in the highest degree It is taken from Captain Meares's voyage from China to the northern latitudes of America That navi∣gator having gained the inhospitable coast he was in pursuit of was sailing among unknown bays and gulphs when he was suddenly im∣mersed in so thick a fog that the seamen could not even discern an object from one end of the ship to the other Night too came on which rendered every thing still more dismal While the unhappy crew were ruminating on the va∣riety of distresses that surrounded them about midnight they were alarmed with the sound of waves bursting and dashing among rocks with∣in a little distance of the head of the ship In∣stantly turning the helm they tacked about But they had sailed only a short way in this new direction when they were terrified with the same dreadful notes a second time They altered their course again but the same tre∣mendous sound again recurred At length day came on but the fog continuing as intense as before they could see nothing All they knew was that they were surrounded by rocks on  every side but how to escape they had no idea Once during a momentary interruption of the fog they got a glimpse of the summit of an immense cliff covered with snow tower∣ing over the mast But the fog instantly shut it in A more dreadful situation cannot easily be conceived They had steered in every di∣rection but always found they were landlocked and though they were continually close to the shore on sounding they could find no bottom Their anchors therefore were of no use Four days they continued in this dreadful suspence tacking from side to side on the th the fog cleared away and they had a view at once of the terrors that surrounded them They had by some strange accident found their way into a bay invironed on all sides with precipices of immense height covered with snow and falling down to the water in lofty rocks which were every where perpendi∣cular except in some parts where the constant beating of the surge had hollowed them into caverns The sound they heard was from the waters swelling and rushing into these caverns which absorbing them drove them out again with great fury against the rocks at their mouths dashing them into foam with a tre∣mendous  sound Captain Meares now per∣ceived the passage through which he had been driven into this scene of horrors and made his escape  On reading such accounts as these in a pic∣turesque light one can hardly avoid making a few remarks on the grand effects which may often be produced by what may be called  the scenery of vapour  Nothing offers so extensive a field to the fancy in  invented  scenes nothing subjects even the  compositions of nature  so much to the control and improvement of art It admits the painter to a participation with the poet in the use of the machinery of  uncertain forms  to which both are indebted for their  sublimest images  A  sublime image  is perhaps an incorrect phrase The regions of sublimity are not peopled by  forms  but  hints  they are not enlightened by  sunshine  but by  gleams  and  flashes  The transient view of the summit of a cliff towering over the mast filled the despair∣ing seaman with more terror than if he had seen the whole rocky bay It set his imagi∣nation at work The ideas of  grace and beauty  are as much raised by leaving the image half  immersed in obscurity as the ideas of  terror  Definition which throws a light on philosophic truth destroys at once the airy shapes of fic∣tion Virgil has given more beauty in three words  Lumenque juventae  Purpureum  than he could have done in the most laboured description as Grey likewise has in the two following lines though some cold critic would probably ask for an explanation  O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move  The bloom of young desire and purple light of love  It is by snatches only that you catch a glimpse of such beauties Would you analyse them the vision dissolves in the process and disap∣pears like life pursued to its last retreat by the anatomist You ruin the image by determining its form and identifying its tints  As we proceeded farther along the heights of Quantoc we had views of the promontory of Minehead which forms a more beautiful coast than Bridgewaterbay the land is higher and more varied Here we had still a distinct view of the Bristol channel and the coast of  Wales The sea as is not uncommon hap∣pened to be beautifully variegated It had a reddish hue with a tinge of rainbow green which being mixed together formed different gradations of kindred colours and sometimes going off in purple gave the surface of the ocean a great resplendency  Minehead seems by its situation to confirm what we were told that its harbour was the best and safest in this part of the coast When the great storm of ravaged all these shores with peculiar fury Minehead was the only harbour which could defend it's shipping It is chiefly useful in the Irish trade as it lies in the midway between Ireland and Bristol  In so ordinary a town as Watchet we were surprised to find so handsome a pier But in many of the ports along this coast though inconsiderable in appearance we see a great air of business This little Mediterranean is crowded with skiffs passing and repassing and has a brisk trade within itself in corn metals limestone and other commodities The coast about Watchet is very rocky and the crevices of the rocks are curiously veined with alabaster  which makes a part of the traffic of the place But the stone from which the greatest advan∣tage is derived is a kind of pebble found on the shore when the tide leaves it These peb∣bles burn into lime of so peculiar a texture that when placed under water it assumes its original hardness Even when pulverized and laid upon land it is turned into a kind of hard grit by the first shower of rain In the found∣ation of bridges therefore and all stonework which lies under water the lime of Watchet is exceedingly valued A species of this kind of lime Mr Bryant informs us was in use among the Romans the foundationstones particu∣larly of the great mole at Puteoli were united by this cement  See Bryant's Dissert on the Wind Euroclydon p    From Watchet we pursued our route along the coast The promontory of Minehead still continued the principal feature of the view As we approached it a woody hill which in the distance adhered to the promontory began more and more to detach itself from it and as we came still nearer we discovered a light airy building on its summit which by degrees ap∣peared  to be an unfinished edifice with its scaf∣folding about it In this condition it has pro∣bably a more picturesque effect than it will have when it has completely taken the form which seems to be intended At a distance it had the appearance of the Sibyl's temple at Tivoli the tower is round and the scaffolding annexed the idea of a range of ruined pillars supporting the roof  As we turned a little from the sea Dunstercastle the seat of Mr Lutterell opened before us at about the distance of half a mile and made a striking appearance It is indeed on the whole one of the grandest artificial objects we had met with on our journey Its towers which are picturesque arise near the summit of a woody hill which seems connected with an∣other hill much higher though it is in fact de∣tached from it This apparent union makes the composition more agreable and is of great advantage to the view It takes away that idea of art which an insulated hill would be apt to raise The consequence of this grand object is greatly increased by a  dead flat  between it and the eye  Broken ground  in  itself is more beautiful but a  flat  often carries the eye more directly to a capital object with which also it often very agreably contrasts I speak however undecidedly because some∣times it is otherwise But in the present case we thought the approach by a flat had a good effect  From the terrace of the castle we had a great variety of amusing landscapes though nothing very interesting We obtained a good idea however of the form of the country and found that Dunstercastle which stands high is surrounded though at a considerable dis∣tance by grounds that are much higher In this amusing circle round the walls of the castle we had three distinct species of landscape a  parkscene  a tract of  mountainous country  and a  seacoast  In the time of the civil wars Dunstercastle had a respectable name and was considered as one of the strongest of the King's garrisons in the west When his affairs were in the wane after the battle of Naisby it was fixed on as the best place of refuge for the Prince of Wales but the plague immediately breaking out in the town of Dunster some other place of security was sought for  At Dunster we were told there is a very elegant Gothic church built in the time of Henry VII when it is commonly supposed Gothic architecture was in its purest state though I think it was rather as all arts end in refinement at that period on the decline Whether this church however were of elegant architecture or not the late intelligence we received did not suffer us to examine We had already left the place and when there had conceived the castle to be the only thing worth visiting  From Dunster in our route to Dulverton we had a pleasant ride for half a dozen miles through a winding valley and along the sides of hills on the left which came sloping down with their woody skirts to the road But we soon exchanged these vallies for a naked open country and the woody hills for dreary slopes cut into portions by naked hedges unadorned by a single tree  As we left Dulverton in our way to Tiver∣ton we entered another pleasing valley wooded  thick with oaks which climbed a steep on the right and formed a hanging grove On the left ran the Ex a rapid rockychannelled stream shaded likewise with trees Beyond the Ex the ground rose in a beautiful parkscene in the midst of which stands the house of Sir Thomas Acland  From hence to Tiverton the country affords nothing that is striking We had hills but they were tame and uniform following each other in such quick succession that we rarely found either a foreground or a distance As we mounted one we had another immediately in view At Tiverton are the remains of a castle which was formerly the mansion of the earls of Devonshire  SECT XVII  FROM hence we travelled through the same kind of hilly country towards Barnstaple In our way we turned aside to see Lord For∣tescue's at Castlehill where we did not think we were sufficiently repaid for going so far out of our way Lord Fortescue has improved a large tract of ground but with no great taste or contrivance  The reader will recollect this was written several years ago and that many alterations may since have been made  Into one error he has parti∣cularly fallen that of overbuilding his im∣provements From one stand we counted eight or nine buildings This is the common error of improvers It is a much easier matter to erect a temple or a Palladian bridge than to improve a piece of ground with simplicity and beauty and give it the air of nature One of his buildings an old castle upon a hill from which his place I suppose takes its name stands beautifully Little more I should think in the way of building would have been ne∣cessary  This lofty castle might be object suf∣ficient from almost every part of his improve∣ments  As we approached Barnstaple the view from some of the high grounds is very grand com∣posed on one side of Barnstaplebay and on the other of an extensive vale the vale of Taunton carrying the eye far and wide into its rich and ample bosom It is one of those views which is too great a subject for painting Art confined by the rules of picturesque com∣position must keep within the compass of inch foot and yard But such slender confines cannot rouse the imagination like these exten∣sive scenes of nature The painter jealous of his art will sometimes deny this If the pic∣ture he tells us be well painted the size is nothing His canvas however diminutive has the effect of nature and deceives the eye You are affected says he by a landscape seen  through the pane of a window  Why may you not be equally affected by a landscape  well painted within the same dimensions  It is true the eye is frequently imposed upon It is often  purposely  misled by  tricks  of deception  But it is not under the idea of deception that the  real  artist paints He does not mean to  impose  upon us by making us believe that a picture of a foot long is an extended landscape All he wishes is to give such  characteristic touches  to his picture as may be able to rouse the imagi∣nation of the beholder The picture is not so much the  ultimate end  as it is the  medium  through which the ravishing scenes of nature are excited in the imaginationWe do in∣deed examine a picture likewise by the rules of picturesque composition but  this mode  of examination we are not now considering The rules of composition serve only to make the picture answer more effectually its  ultimate end  We are now considering only the effect which the picture produces on the mind of the spec∣tator by carrying him forcibly and yet will∣ingly with his  eyes open  into those scenes which it describes  It is just the same in every species of paint∣ing The portraitpainter must raise the idea of wit or humour or integrity or good sense or piety or dignity in the character of the per∣son whose portrait he represents or he does nothing In history too unless the picture rouse the imagination to something more than  you see on the canvas it leaves half its work undone You coolly criticise it indeed by  pic∣turesque rules  But that is not all It ought to raise in you those ideas and sentiments which paint cannot express that is it should produce something  in you  which the painter could not produce  on his canvas  On the whole then the  true enjoyment of the picture  depends chiefly on the  imagination of the spectator  and as the utmost the landscapepainter can do is to  excite the ideas  of those de∣lightful scenes which he represents it follows that  those scenes themselves  must have a much greater effect on the imagination than any  re∣presentation  of them which he can give that is the idea must be much more strongly ex∣cited by the  original  than by a  representative  The fact is art is a mere trifler compared with Nature The efforts of both it is true may be called the works of God but the difference lies here In the efforts of  art  God works with those little instruments called  men  he works in miniature But when he works in the grand style of  nature  the elements are his instru∣ments  See the subject of these last pages treated in another view in vol ii of For Scen p    SECT XVIII  THE approach to Barnstable from the lower grounds is as beautiful as from the higher The river the bridge the hills beyond it and the estuary in the distance make all together a good landscape The town itself also situated about nine or ten miles from the sea stands in a pleasant vale shut in by hills forming a se∣milunar cove around it When the tides are high it is almost insulated The flat grounds which lie immediately about it make an agree∣able contrast with the hills Once these grounds were little better than marshes but by proper draining they are now become beautiful mea∣dows In a word Barnstable is the pleasantest town we met with in the west of England  From hence to Torrington the country is uninteresting but between Torrington and Oakhampton it assumed a better appearance In some parts of it we had grand distances in other parts hanging woods particularly a  very noble one belonging to Mr Harris which travelled with us a considerable way on the left and afforded us a view sometimes over it and sometimes through it but at all times pleasing  From Oakhampton we visited the falls of Lidford which compose the most celebrated piece of scenery in this country  Lidford was formerly a town of the first consequence in England In William the Con∣queror's time it was taxed pretty nearly on an equality with London As tin was at that time the staple commodity of the country Lidford might draw its consequence from being one of the principal marts of that metal Here afterwards a stannerycourt was kept The castle in which it was held is still in being It is a large square tower rather out of repair than in ruin Near it stands the parish church and at a distance we had a view of another church loftily seated called Brentor But the falls of Lidford are a mile and half from the castle  In our way we were to pass a bridge which we were informed was thrown over the rocky  sides of two frightful precipices of the river Lid each eighty feet high The idea was ter∣rific and we expected a very grand scene But we were disappointed from the omission of a single circumstance in the intelligence which was that the separation between these two tre∣mendous precipices is little more than the cre∣vice of a rock and in fact we had passed it before we knew we had been upon it It is only seen by looking over the battlements of the bridge If the day be clear you just dis∣cover the river foaming among rocks many fa∣thoms below If not you must be content with listening to its roar The music how∣ever is grand for if the river be full the notes swell nobly from the bottom varied as they are by ascending so narrow and broken a funnel  We were told a story of a London rider who travelled this road in a stormy night and being desirous to escape the rain as quickly as he could pushed his horse with what exertion his whip and spurs could excite The next morning he heard that Lidford bridge had been carried away in the night when he recollected that his horse had made a singular bound in the middle of its course In fact he had seen bet∣ter  in the dark than his master and had saved both his own life and his rider's by springing over the chasm  In the back settlements of Virginia at the bottom of the Allegeny mountains near a place called Stanton there is a specimen of this mode of scenery in a very grand style A valley winds several leagues in length and yet is scarce any where more than a hundred feet wide though in many places it is two hun∣dred and fifty deep It is adorned in various parts with rock and secured by lofty moun∣tains covered with wood This valley through much of its course is little more than the chan∣nel of a considerable river But in one part the rocks approximate so nearly as to form a complete natural arch not only over the river but over the valley itself When Nature  mi∣mics  if I may so speak the works of man for bridges are not a natural production you see the comparative magnificence of her operations not only in their vastness but in the careless simplicity with which they are wrought When the hand of man throws an arch over a river or a chasm he piles up a number of little stones or bricks fixing them with cement carefully and painfully one upon  another in a certain regular shape All is nicety exactness and precision If one stone be fixed awry the whole structure is endan∣gered But when Nature throws an arch her first operation perhaps is to bury deep in the soil one end of some vast diagonal or hori∣zontal stratum of rock flinging the other end athwart over the chasm or if that be not sufficient she unites it perhaps to the fragment of a rock formed in the same manner on the other side of a valley Sometimes she works in a still grander style and forms her arch of one single mass of perforated stone which in  her  way she hews into a vast irregular surface In both operations it is evident a variety of forms must result Sometimes the arch is pointed sometimes it is flat and horizontal and often varied into some nameless form When the grand mass of the edifice is thus reared Nature proceeds to ornament She leaves the cornice and the balustrade to human artists Her ornaments are of a different kind She first spreads the whole over with soil In the American arch here specified the thickness of the soil including the substratum of rock is at least forty feet This is a depth of soil suffi∣cient for trees of considerable size many of  which adorn the arch Among these Nature has planted various shrubs and hanging bushes which are often highly coloured and stream∣ing down wave in the wind in great profusion Then perhaps with one of her broadest pencils she dashes the sides of the rock with a thou∣sand beautiful stains from mosses and other in∣crusted vegetation of various kinds which finish and complete the operation  Thus Nature works as if to mock at Art  And in defiance of her rival powers  By these fortuitous and random strokes  Performing such inimitable feats  As she with all her rules can never reach  Such an arch is the American one we are now surveying which on the authority of an eyewitness I have heard described as a most magnificent structure of the kind Sometimes I understand when the water is low the tra∣veller may walk under it survey its massy abutments and looking up admire its tremen∣dous roof raised at the vast height of at least two hundred feet above his head and frosted over with various knobs and rocky protube∣rances which have stood for ages though they continually threaten ruin When he hath sa∣tisfied his curiosity below he may find a path  which leads him to the top There he meets a commodious road which is the only passage the inhabitants have over the valley He finds also in different parts a rude rocky parapet and if his curiosity carry him farther he may cling to some wellrooted plant and have a perpendicular view to the river below as ter∣rific as the view he had just had over his head He will probably see also on one side the river as it approaches and on the other as it retires Many beauties I doubt not might likewise be pointed out from this station But what I have heard chiefly noticed are the rocky hills which environ the valley and shoot into it here and there in vast promontories covered with stately pines and oaks which perhaps flourished as they now do in the days of Co∣lumbus Let us now return to humbler scenes  The channel of the Lid though contracted at the bridge soon widens both below it and above and would afford many beautiful scenes to those who had leisure to explore them This river rises about three or four miles above Lidford on the edge of Dartmore and flowing through a barren plain finds a small rocky barrier through which it has in a course of ages worn a whimsical passage As it issues  from the check it meets with here it falls about thirty feet into a small dell which was not represented to us as a scene of much beauty But a little farther the banks rise on each side vegetation riots the stream descends by a winding and rapid course and the skreens though small are often beautifully adorned with wood and rock By this time the river approaches the bridge where it is lost in the narrowness of the channel and as I have just observed becomes almost subterranean  From the bridge we proceeded directly to what are emphatically called  the falls of Lid∣ford  which are about three miles below We alighted at a farmhouse and were conducted on foot to the brow of a steep woody hill from which we had a grand view of Lidfordcastle which appeared now at a distance more proudly seated than it seemed to be when we rode past it Of the river we saw nothing but could easily make out its channel under the abutments of grand promontories which marked its course  Having viewed this noble landscape we de∣scended the hill by a difficult winding path and at the bottom found the Lid The appear∣ance which the river and its appendages made  here from the lower grounds were equally pleasing though not so grand as from the higher Indeed no part of this magnificent scenery would be a disgrace to the wildest and most picturesque country  The  fall of the river  which brought us hi∣ther and which is the least considerable part of the scenery for we had heard nothing of these  noble views  is a mere gardenscene The steep woody hilt whose shaggy sides we had descended forms at the bottom in one of its envelopes a sort of little woody theatre ra∣ther indeed too lofty when compared with its breadth if Nature had been as exact as Art would have been in observing proportion Down the central part of it which is lined with smooth rock the river falls This rocky cheek is narrow at the top but it widens as it descends taking probably the form of the stream when it is full At the time we saw it it was rather a spout than a cascade for though it slides down a hundred and eighty feet it does not meet one obstruction in its whole course except a little check in the middle When the springs are low and the water has not quantity enough to push itself forward in one current I have been told it sometimes falls  in various little streams against the irregulari∣ties of the rock and is dashed into a kind of vapoury rain which has a good effect  This cascade it seems is not formed by the waters of the Lid as we had supposed from its name but by a little stream which runs into that river rising in the higher grounds at the distance of about two miles from the cascade  SECT XIX  FROM Lidford we found a cheerful coun∣try to Tavistock In our way we passed Brentor which we had seen at a distance when we first saw the castle of Lidford It is seated on the top of a mountain and was enveloped when we rode past it in all the majesty of darkness In fact it was so much immersed in clouds that we could not even distinguish its form and if we had not seen it before at a distance we should have been at a loss to have known what it was though we should certainly have thought it rather a castle than a church How very lofty its situation is may be supposed from its being a good seamark in opening Plymouth harbour though it stands at the distance of twenty miles from the sea  At Tavistock from the appearance which the river Tavey makes at the bridge it is pro∣bable there may be some beautiful scenes along its banks but we had not time to explore them  As to the abbey though it was once of mi∣tred dignity and though a considerable por∣tion of it still remains we did not observe a single passage that was worth our notice What is left is worked up into barns mills and dwell∣inghouses It may give the antiquarian plea∣sure to reverse all this metamorphosis to trace back the stable to the Abbott's lodge the mill to the refectory and the malthouse to the chapel but the picturesque eye is so far from looking at these deeds of economy under the idea of pleasure that it passes by them with disdain as heterogeneous absurdities  From Tavistock our next stage was to Laun∣ceston through what seemed an unpleasant country But the whole road was involved in so thick a fog that we saw but little of it Where we could have wished the fog to clear up it fortunately did at a place called Ax∣worthy Here we descended a steep winding woody hill through the trees of which we had beautiful views of tufted groves and other ob∣jects on the opposite side At the bottom we found the Tamar a fine stream adorned with a picturesque bridge  The road soon brought us to Launceston the capital of Cornwall which is a handsome town The castle was formerly esteemed one of the strongest fortresses of the west as we may suppose at least from the name it bore which was that of  Castleterrible  During the civil wars of Charles I It continued among the last supports of the royal cause in those parts though it has suffered great dilapi∣dations since that time its remains are still re∣spectable and what is more to the purpose at present they are picturesque The great gate and road up to it and the towers that adorn it make a good picture The stately citadel makes a still better It is raised on a lofty eminence and consists of a round tower en∣compassed by the ruins of a circular wall in which through a wide breach you discover the internal structure to more advantage The construction of this whole fortress is thought to have been very curious and they who wish to have a full account of it may be gra∣tified in Borlase's History of Cornwall  A little to the north of Launceston lies Wer∣rington an estate belonging to the Duke of Northumberland The park contains many beautiful scenes consisting of hanging lawns and woods with a considerable stream the Aire running through it In some parts where the ground is high the views are extensive Many antiquarians suppose this to have been the seat of Orgar Earl of Devonshire whose beautiful daughter Elfrida is the subject of one of the most affecting stories in the English history and one of the purest dramatic com∣positions in the English language  Somewhere in this neighbourhood lived Thomasine Percival at what time I find not but the story of this extraordinary woman is still current in the country She was originally a poor girl and being beautiful had the fortune to marry a rich clothier who dying early left her a welljointured widow A second advan∣tageous match and a second widowhood in∣creased her jointure Being yet in the bloom of youth and beauty her third husband was Sir John Percival a wealthy merchant of Lon∣don of which he was Lord Mayor He also  left her a widow with a large accession of for∣tune Possessed of this accumulated property she retired to her native country where she spent her time and fortune altogether in works of generosity and charity She repaired roads built bridges pensioned poor people and por∣tioned poor girls setting an example which should never be forgotten among the extraor∣dinary things of this country  From Launceston we travelled as far into Cornwall as Bodmin through a coarse naked country and in all respects as uninteresting as can well be conceived Of wood in every shape it was utterly destitute  Having heard that the country beyond Bod∣min was exactly like what we had already passed we resolved to travel no farther in Cornwall and instead of visiting the Land'send as we had intended we took the road to Lescard proposing to visit Plymouth in our return  An antiquarian it is probable might find more amusement in Cornwall than in almost any country in England Even along the road  we saw stones and other objects which seemed to bear marks both of curiosity and antiquity Some of the stones appear plainly to be monu∣mental the famous  Hurlers  we did not see  The naturalist also the botanist and the fos∣silist especially the last might equally find Cornwall a country full of interesting objects Here his search would be rewarded by a great variety of metals fossils stones pebbles and earths  Here too the historian might trace the va∣rious scenes of Druid rites and of Roman and Danish power Here also he might investi∣gate some of the capital actions of the civil wars of the last century and follow the foot∣steps of Fairfax Sir Beville Grenville Lord Hopton and other great commanders in the west The battle of Stratton in which the last of those generals commanded was an action masterly enough to have added laurels to Caesar or the King of Prussia Indeed we could have wished to have gone a few miles farther to the north of this country to have investigated the scene of this action Lord Clarendon has described it so accurately that it can hardly be mistaken It was a hill steep on all sides bordering if I understand him rightly  on a sandy common On the top were en∣camped a body of of the parliament forces with thirteen pieces of cannon under the Earl of Stamford At five o'clock in the morning on the th of May the roy∣alists attacked them with very inferior force in four divisions who mounted four different parts of the hill at once After a wellfought day they all met about three in the afternoon at the top and congratulated each other on having cleared the hill of the enemy and taken their camp baggage ammunition and cannon The scene of so notable an exploit may be still per∣haps pointed out by the inhabitants of the country From Lord Clarendon's description however it may certainly be found  It is probable also that in a picturesque light many of the castles of this county might have deserved attention many of the coasts might have amused us with elegant sweeping lines and many of the bays might have been nobly hung with rockey scenery We should have wished also to have heard the winds howl among the bleak promontories of the Land'send to have seen through a clear evening the light fall indistinctly on the distant isles of Scilly and to have viewed the waves beating  round the rocks of that singular situation Mount St Michael The loss of this last scene we regretted more than any thing else But to travel over desarts of dreariness in quest of two or three objects seemed to be buying them at too high a price especially as it is possible they might have disappointed us in the end Many a time has the credulous traveller gone in quest of scenes on the information of others and has found such is the difference of opinions that what gave his informant pleasure has given him disgust  SECT XX  IN returning from Bodmin we passed over that part of Bradocdowns where Lord Hopton's prowess was again shewn in giving a considerable check to the parliament's forces in those parts This wild heath and much of the neighbouring country is in the same style of dreary landscape with that we had found between Launceston and Bodmin So very undisciplined the country still is that the wild stags of nature in many parts claim it as their own We did not see any of them but we were told they sometimes shew themselves on the high moors about Bodmin and Lescard  And yet these are the lands wild as they are that are the richest of the country They bear little corn it is true but it is very im∣material what the surface produces the har∣vest lies beneath In this neighbourhood some of the richest of the Cornish mines are found and Lescard where we now were is one of the Coinagetowns as they are called Of these towns there are five which are scattered  about the different parts of Cornwall where mines are most frequent After the tin is pounded and washed from the impurities of the mine it is melted separated from its dross and run into large square blocks con∣taining each about three hundred pounds weight In this form it is conveyed to the Coinagetown where it is assayed and stamped This stamp makes it a saleable commodity  We had not however the curiosity to enter any of these mines Our business was only on the surface Great part of this country it is true is in a state of nature which in general is a state of picturesque beauty but here it was otherwise Our views not only wanted the most necessary appendages of landscape wood and water but even  form  We might perhaps have seen this part of Cornwall in an unfa∣vourable light as the sweeping lines of a country depend much for their beauty on the light under which they are seen but to us they appeared heavy unbroken and unaccom∣modating In the wild parts of Scotland where this dreariness of landscape often oc∣curred we had still a distance to make amends for the foregrounds It was rarely that we had not a flowing line of blue mountains  which gave a grandeur and dignity even to an impoverished scene But in these wild parts of Cornwall we sometimes saw a face of coun∣try which is rather uncommon in the wildest scenes of nature without a single beauty to re∣commend it  This dreariness however had begun to im∣prove before we arrived at Lescard Planta∣tions though meagre only arose in various parts and the country assumed somewhat of a more pleasing air particularly on the right towards Lestwithiel The high grounds formed intersections something like a castle appeared on one of them and the woody decorations of landscape in some degree took place  As we left Lescard the country still im∣proved Extensive sides of hills covered with wood arose among the foregrounds and rang∣ing in noble sweeps retired into distance These bursts of sylvan scenery appeared with particular beauty at a place called Brown'swoods Here too we were entertained with an  incidental beauty  The whole sky in front was hung with dark clouds to the very skirts of the horizon Behind us shone the brightest  ray of an evening sun not yet indeed setting but very splendid and all this splendor was received by the tops of trees which rose di∣rectly in front and being opposed to the gloomy tint behind them made a most bril∣liant appearance This is among the most beautiful effects of an eveningsun These effects are indeed as various as the forms of landscape which receive them but nothing is more  richly  enlightened than the tufted foliage of a wood  We now approached the sea at least the river Tamer which is near its estuary and as this coast is perhaps one of the most broken and irregular of the whole island we had se∣veral views of little creaks and bays which being surrounded with wood are often beau∣tiful But they are beautiful at fullsea only at the ebb of the tide each lake becomes an oozy channel  The picturesque beauty of a scene of this kind once cost a poor traveller dear He had long been in quest of a situation for a house and found one at length offered to sale ex∣actly suited to his taste It was a lake scene  in which a little peninsula sloping gently into the water presented from its eminence a pleas∣ing view of the whole Charmed with what he had seen he ruminated in his way home on the various improvements it might admit and fearing a disappointment entered without farther scrutiny into an agreement with the owner for a considerable sum But what was his astonishment when on taking possession his lake was gone and in its room a bed of filthy ooze How did he accuse his rashness and blame his precipitate folly In vain he wished to retract his bargain In vain he pleaded that he had been deceived that he had bought a lake and that in fact the ob∣ject of his purchase was gone  You might have examined it better  cried the unfeeling gentlemen of the law  What have we to do with your ideas of picturesque beauty We sold you an estate and if you imposed upon yourself you have nobody else to blame  From the road as we passed we had a view of Trematoncastle where a stannery court is still kept which had formerly very extensive  privileges  Trematonlaw  is almost to this day an object of reverence among the common people of Cornwall  Soon after Saltashbay opened on the left and on the right Hamoaz harbour with many a gallant ship of war at anchor upon its ample bosom Beyond the Hamoaz rose the hang∣ing lawns and woods of Mount Edgcomb forming a noble background to the scene  At Saltash we had good views of the river Tamer both above and below the town A sweeping bay is formed on each side in many places at least a mile in breadth In both di∣rections the banks are high and the water re∣tires beautifully behind jutting promontories  Having crossed the Tamer at Saltash we had four miles farther to Plymouth Through the whole way we had various views of the the sound Mount Edgcomb Plymouth har∣bour Hamoaz Plymouth town and Plymouth dock From all these views together we were able to collect a clear geographical idea of this celebrated harbour  Two rivers the Tamer and the Plym the first of which is considerable meeting the sea at the distance of about three miles asunder form at their separate mouths two indented bays These two bays open into a third which is the receptacle of both and larger than either The bay formed by the Tamer is called the  Hamoaz  that formed by the Plym is called  Plymouth Harbour  and the large bay into which they both open is called the  Sound  At the bottom of the Sound where the two bays communicate with it lies St Nicolas a large island fortified with a castle and strong works which are intended to defend the en∣trance into both these inlets The entrance into Hamoaz is very intricate for the island can be passed only at that end next Plymouth which makes the passage narrow and winding The entrance at the other end is wide and direct but is defended by a dangerous shelf of hidden rocks the situation of which ap∣pears plainly at lowwater from the ripling of the tide above them The Cornish side of Ha∣moaz is formed by Mount Edgcomb  SECT XXI  PLymouthdock or Docktown as it is often called lies at the entrance of Ha∣moaz and is about two miles distant from the town of Plymouth It is chiefly worth visit∣ing as it is the station of the docks storehouses gunwharfs and other appendages of this noble arsenal which is a wonderful sight to those who have seen nothing of the kind The ci∣tadel too and the victuallingoffice which is close to it the bakehouse also and the slaugh∣terhouse whatever unpleasant ideas may ac∣company the latter are all grand objects of their kind  Among the things which attracted our at∣tention at Plymouthdock were the marble quarries We saw several of the blocks po∣lished and thought them more beautiful than any foreign marble The ground is dark brown the veining red and blue The colours are soft in themselves and intermix agreeably  whereas in the Sienna and other foreign marbles there is often amidst all the richness of their colours a glare and harshness in their mixtures disagreeable to the picturesque eye which always wishes to unite harmony with colouring In the verde antique the tints are sufficiently soft but they are so much the same and broken into such minute parts that they have no effect when exhibited in quantity After all however different kinds of marble are suited to different purposes But I think there are two rules which should direct the choice of all marbles In columns and other large surfaces the parts should be large that is the veins of the marble should be conspicuous I think also that no marble in any situation can be beautiful unless there be a degree of soft∣ness and harmony in it if it be veined for in∣stance the veins should in some parts strike out boldly and in other parts sink and retire as it were into the ground of the marble leaving only slight traces of their colours here and there behind them In both these respects I have thought the columns in the hall at Kid∣delston in Derbyshire models of beauty It will however be understood that when  form  or  inscription  is required veined marble of any kind is improper In some works as in most kinds of ornaments the marble itself is the principal object in others as in statuary and inscription the marble is only the vehicle  With the Plymouth marble in its rough state most of the buildings of the dock are constructed The refuse burns into excellent lime Between Launceston and Kellington I have heard there is a species of marble found almost purely white but as I never heard of its being applied to any use I suppose it is only of a spurious kind  There is also another species of beautiful stone much in use at Plymouth which is of Cornish extraction and is found chiefly on the moors from whence it is called the  Moorstone  The best kind of it is a perfect granite and will bear a polish though the spars some∣times fly off in the operation and leave an un∣equal surface The more friable kind of this stone spangles the road with an excellent bind∣ing gravel  Among the sights of a dockyard the ca∣reening of a ship is not the least picturesque We happened to see an operation of this kind  in great perfection The ship itself lying on one side is a good object Its great lines which in an upright state are too regular take now more pleasing forms and while the roll∣ing volumes of smoke harmonize the whole the fire glimmering sparkling or blazing is some∣times enveloped in these black voluminous eddies and sometimes brightening up breaks through them in transient spiry blazes  But as  light  is best supported by  shade  a conflagration by  night  from whatever cause produced has the grandest effect By day the effect depends chiefly on the smoke aided per∣haps by some accidental objects as it was here by the pitchy side of a vessel But at night the darkness of the hemisphere makes the grandest opposition The light is concen∣trated to one spot only variously broken as it may happen to fall on different objects At the same time it receives the full beauty of gradation The ruddy glow which spreads far and wide into the regions of night gra∣duates as it recedes from its centre and be∣coming fainter and fainter is at last totally lost in the shades of darkness A conflagration therefore by night presents us with the justest  ideas of the great principles of light and shade It gives a  body of light variously broken  and at length dying  gradually away  A common bonfire surrounded by a few figures scattered about it in groups forms often a beautiful scene That passage in which Shakespeare describes the campfires of the French and English gives us a different pic∣ture In that description the fires are  distant  and the  paly flames  just  umber  the faces that watch round them Touched with the pencil they should be marked only as ruddy specks all distinction of feature is lost But round a  bonfire on the spot  you see action and passion distinctly represented the hat waved the agi∣tated body and the lips of the bawling mouth all marked with the strongest effects of light while some of the figures which stand be∣tween the eye and the fire are as picturesquely distinguished by being totally in shade  Grand indeed though dreadful is the con∣flagration of houses especially if those houses have any dignity of form The bursts of fire from windows and doors the illumination of the internal parts of a structure and the va∣ried force of the fire on the different materials it meets with which may be more or less com∣bustible  are all circumstances highly pictu∣resque It may be added also that wind makes a great difference in the appearance of a conflagration and yet I know not whether its most splendid effects are not seen best in a calm  But the operations of war produce still grander effects of this kind The burning of ships is productive of greater ideas and more picturesque circumstances than the burning of houses The very reflections from the water add great beauty But these representations are among the difficult attempts of the pencil Vanderveld who did every thing well and burnt many a ship in a truly picturesque man∣ner failed most in his grandest work the burn∣ing of the Armada  Some parts  of his pic∣tures on this subject at Hampton Court are masterly but in  general  they are but an indif∣ferent collection of Vanderveld's works Pro∣bably the subject was  imposed  on him and when that is the case the painter seldom arrives at the excellence which  his own subjects  pro∣duce It cannot well indeed be otherwise for the  choice of a subject  is in other words  that just arrangement  of it which he conceives ia his own mind both in regard to compo∣sition  and light So that when a subject is  imposed  the arrangement is to  seek  and it is probable he may not easily find one that suits his subject Besides he sets to it without that enthusiasm which should animate his pencil When the Empress of Russia therefore em∣ployed Sir Joshua Reynolds she did well in leaving him to choose his own subject One thing indeed which injures Vanderveld in burning the Armada picturesquely is the num∣ber of fires he is obliged to introduce which can never have so good an effect as one  But among all the grand exhibitions of this kind the siege of Gibraltar furnishes two of the noblest They had every circumstance to recommend them They were grand in their own nature they were connected with great and prosperous events which is a recommend∣ation of any subject and they were actions performed in the night The first relates to the burning of the enemy's batteries by a sally from the garrison the second to the destruc∣tion of the battering ships I shall give them both in the words of a published Journal of that siege in which the effects are well de∣scribed  See Drinkwater's Account of the Siege of Gibraltar p    Nov The batteries were soon in a state for the firefaggots to operate and the flames spread with astonishing rapidity into every part The column of fire and smoke which rolled from the works beauti∣fully illumined the troops and neighbour∣ing objects forming all together a  coup d'ail  not possible to be described  Sept About an hour after mid∣night one of the batteringships was com∣pletely in flames and by two o'clock she appeared one continued blaze from stem to stern Between three and four o'clock six other ships were on fire The light thrown out on all sides by the flames illumined the rock and all the neighbouring objects forming with the constant flashes of our cannon a mingled scene of sublimity and terror  See Drinkwater's Account of the Siege p    The former of these scenes would have made a good picture the latter if repre∣sented should be taken when one ship only was completely in flames with small appear∣ances of fire in some of the others  At the end of the th book of Homer we have the effects of an illumination very pictu∣resquely  detailed Hector  aving driven the Greeks to their intrenchments was prevented by the night from completing his victory Resolving therefore to push it the next morn∣ing instead of retreating to Troy he encamped under its walls in the field of battle where  Unnumbered flames before proud Ilion blaze  And lighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays  The long reflections of the distant fires  Gleam on the walls and tremble on the spires  A thousand piles the dusky horrors gild  And shoot a shadowy lustre o'er the field  Full fifty guards each flaming pile attend  Whose umber'd arms by sits thick flashes send  Homer however has nothing to do with most of these picturesque images They are only to be found in Pope's translation Though it may be fashionable to depreciate this work as a translation it must at least be owned that Pope who was a painter has enriched his ori∣ginal with many of the ideas of his art  But still in all these operations however grand the fire ravages only the  works of man  To see a conflagration in perfection we must see the  elements engaged  Nothing is  eminently grand  but the exertion of an  element  The effect of the  air  is grand when excited by a storm Piles of  earth  or  mountains  are superbly  grand The  ocean  in a storm is still grander and the effect of  fire  when let loose in its full fury carries the idea of grandeur to a still greater height  One of the most astonishing effects of this kind which is any where to be met with may be found in the th volume of the Philoso∣phical Transactions in a letter from Sir William Hamilton It contains the account of an erup∣tion of Mount Vesuvius in the autumn of the year The whole relation is full of grand ideas but the parts of it to which I particu∣larly allude were the  concluding efforts  of the eruption from which I shall select a few cir∣cumstances  The relater who was an eyewitness tells us that on Saturday the th of August as he was watching the agitations of the mountain from the mole of Naples which gave him a distinct view of it a violent storm came on just as the volcano was throwing out some of its fiercest fires The clouds of black smoke sometimes covered great part of the fire at other times disparting presented it in fuller view This awful conjunction of light and shadow was farther assisted by various tints which were produced by lights reverberated  from the clouds and by pale flashes of light∣ning which were continually issuing from them  But the appearance of the volcano the next day was still more sublime About nine o'clock in the morning a loud report issued from the mountain which shook the houses of Por∣tici to such a degree as to alarm the inhabit∣ants for their safety and drive them into the streets Immediately volumes of liquid fire or rather as the relater describes it fountains of redhot lava shot upwards to such an amaz∣ing height that they seemed three times as high as the mountain itself which is computed to rise three thousand feet from the level of the sea Together with these volumes of liquid fire vast clouds of the blackest smoke succeeded each other in bursts intercepting this splendid brightness here and there by masses of the darkest hue  The wind was southwest and though gen∣tle was sufficient to put the smoke into mo∣tion removing it by degrees so as to form be∣hind the fire a vast curtain stretching over great part of the hemisphere To add to the solemnity this black curtain was continually disparted by pale momentary electric fires  In the mean time the other parts of the sky were clear and the stars shone bright The contrast was glorious beyond imagination The splendor which was sufficiently balanced by the shadowy curtain behind it illumined the sea which was perfectly calm far and wide and added much to the sublimity of the scene  Some of the fiery lava being thrown on mount Somna in the neighbourhood of Ve∣suvius its woods were frequently in a blaze This introduced a secondary light very differ∣ent in its tint either from the fiery red of the volcano or the silvery blue of the electric fire  This grand and awful vision in which as sub∣lime  an effect of light and shade  was presented as Nature perhaps ever exhibited before lasted about half an hour  I make no apology for introducing all these grand effects of fire as I never think myself out of sight of my subject when I can lay hold of any picturesque idea  SECT XXII  OUR curiosity having been gratified among the dockyards at Plymouth led us next to visit Mount Edgcomb  The promontory of Mount Edgcomb run∣ning a considerable way into the sea forms as was just observed one of the cheeks of the en∣trance of Hamoazharbour which is here half a mile across The whole promontory is four or five miles long and three broad In shape it is a perfect  dorsum  high in the middle and sloping gradually on both sides towards the sea in some places it is rocky and abrupt  Lord Edgcomb's house stands half way up the ascent on the Plymouth side in the midst of a park containing an intermixture of wood and lawn It makes a handsome appearance with a tower at each corner but pretends only to be a comfortable dwelling  The great object of Mount Edgcomb is the grandeur of the views As we advanced towards the summit of the promontory we saw in various exhibitions on one side all the  intricacies and creeks which form the harbour of Plymouth with an extensive country spreading beyond it into very remote distance and scattered with a variety of objects among which we distinguished the wellknown fea∣tures of Brentor  The other side of the promontory overlooks the Sound which is the great rendezvous of the fleets sitted out at Plymouth though sea∣men speak very indifferently of its anchorage One of the boundaries of this extensive bay is a reach of land running out into pointed rocks the other is a lofty smooth promontory called the Ram'shead The top of this promontory is adorned with a tower from which notice is given at Plymouth by a variety of signals of the number of ships and their quality that appear in the offing  Between the Ram'shead and Mount Edg∣comb is formed a smaller inlet called Causandbay at the head of which lies Kingston Be∣fore this little town rode a large fleet of what appeared to be fishing boats but we were in∣formed that most of them were smuggling vessels  The simplicity of the few objects which form the Sound on one side made a pleasing  contrast with the intricacies of the Plymouthcoast on the other  At the distance of about three leagues from the Ram'shead stands the Edystone lighthouse We could just discern it as it caught a gleam of light like a distant sail  Having viewed from the higher grounds of Mount Edgcomb this immense landscape which is on both sides a mere map of the country and has little  picturesque beauty  espe∣cially on the Plymouth side we descended the promontory and were carried on a lower stage round its utmost limits  The grounds here are profusely planted On that side which overlooks Causandbay the plantations are only young but on the other which consists of at least half the promontory they are wellgrown and form the most pleas∣ing scenes about Mount Edgcomb That im∣mense map as it lay before the eye  in one view  from the higher grounds and appeared vari∣ously broken and scattered was now divided into portions and set off by good foregrounds Some of these views are pleasing but in ge∣neral they are not picturesque A large piece of water full of moving objects makes a part  of them all and this will always present at least an amusing scene  The trees both evergreens and deciduous are wonderfully fine considering their seaas∣pect But chiefly the pinerace seems to thrive and among these the pinaster which one should imagine from its hardy appearance to be indigenous to the soil The woodman would dislike that great abundance of hoary moss which bedecks both it and most of the other plants of this marine scenery but to the picturesque eye the vegetation seems perfect and the moss a beauty It is moss of a pecu∣liar form at least of an unusual growth Its hue is generally cerulean with a strong touch here and there of Naplesyellow mixed with other pleasing tints which being scattered pro∣fusely about the whole plantation give it an uncommon richness In these woods the ar∣butus grows in great perfection and many other shrubs which are generally found only in sheltered situations  Besides a luxuriance of wood a variety of rocky scenery embellished our walk especially about the vertical point of the promontory It is a wellcoloured brown rock which appears  in all forms Nor is it bald and naked but every where garnished with twirling boles and hanging shrubs  Upon the whole though there are many formalities about Mount Edgcomb terraces particularly and vistas near the house a few puerilities also  The reader will recollect when this was written  and too little advantage taken every where of the circumstances which na∣ture has pointed out yet it is certainly a noble situation and very well worth the attention of a traveller  SECT XXIII  AMONG the curiosities of this coast the Edystone lighthouse is not one of the least About three leagues beyond Plymouthsound in a line nearly between startpoint and the Lizard lie a number of low rocks exceed∣ingly dangerous at all times but especially when the tides are high which render them in∣visible On these rocks it had long been thought necessary to place some monitory signal But the difficulty of constructing a lighthouse was great One of the rocks indeed which com∣pose this reef is considerably larger than the rest yet its dimensions are still narrow it is often covered with water and frequently even in the calmest weather surrounded by a swell∣ing sea which makes it difficult to land upon it and much more so to carry on any work of time and labour The uncommon tumult of the sea in this place is occasioned by a pecu∣liarity in the rocks As they all slope and point to the northeast they spread their inclined sides of course to the swelling tides and storms  of the Atlantic And as they continue in this shelving direction many fathoms below the sur∣face of the sea they occasion that violent work∣ing of the water which the seamen call a  ground swell  So that after a storm when the surface of the sea around is perfectly smooth the swells and agitation about these rocks are dangerous From these continual eddies the Edystone de∣rives its name  The first lighthouse of any consequence erected on this rock was undertaken by a per∣son of the name of Winstanley in the reign of King William Mr Winstanley does not ap∣pear to have been a man of solidity and judg∣ment sufficient to erect an edifice of this kind He had never been noted for any capital work but much celebrated for a variety of trifling and ridiculous contrivances If you set your foot on a certain board in one of his rooms a ghost would start up or if you sat down in an elbowchair its arms would clasp around you His lighthouse which was built of wood par∣took of his whimsical genius It was finished with galleries and other ornaments which en∣cumbered it without being of any use It was however on the whole much admired as a very ingenious edifice and Winstanley cer∣tainly  deserved the credit of being the first pro∣jector of a very difficult work He had fixed it to the rock by twelve massy bars of iron which were let down deep into the body of the stone It was generally indeed thought well founded and the architect himself was so con∣vinced of its stability that he would often say he wished for nothing more than to be shut up in it during a violent storm He at length had his wish for he happened to be in it at the time of that memorable storm on the th of November which hath been already mentioned  See pages and  As the violence however of the tempest came on the terrified architect began to doubt the firmness of his work it trembled in the blast and shook in every joint In vain he made what signals of distress he could in∣vent to bring a boat from the shore The ter∣rors of the storm were such that the boldest vessel durst not face it How long he conti∣nued in this melancholy distress is unknown but in the morning no appearance of the lighthouse was left It and all its contents during that terrible night were swept into the sea This catastrophe furnished Mr Gay with the  following simile in his Trivia which was writ∣ten a few years after the event  So when fam'd Edyston's farshooting ray  That led the sailor through the stormy way  Was from its rocky roots by billows torn  And the high turret in the whirlwind born  Fleets bulged their sides against the craggy land  And pitchy ruins blacken'd all the strand  A lighthouse was again constructed on this rock before the conclusion of Queen Anne's reign It was undertaken by one Rudyard who built it also of wood but having seen his predecessor's errors avoided them He followed Winstanley's idea in the mode of fix∣ing his structure to the rock but he chose a plain circular form without any gallery or useless projecting parts for the storm to fasten on To give stability also to his work he ju∣diciously introduced as ballast at the bottom tons of stone In short every precaution was taken to secure it against the fury of the two elements of wind and water which had de∣stroyed the last But it fell by a third Late one night in the year it was observed from the shore to be on fire Its upper works having been constructed of light timber pro∣bably could not bear the heat It happened fortunately that Admiral West rode with a  fleet at that time in the Sound and being so near the spot he immediately manned two or three swift boats Other boats put off from the shore but though it was not stormy it was impossible to land In the mean time the fire having descended to the lower parts of the building had driven the poor inhabitants upon the skirts of the rock where they were sitting disconsolate when assistance arrived They had the mortification however to find that the boats through fear of being dashed in pieces were obliged to keep aloof At length it was contrived to throw coils of rope upon the rock which the men tied round them and were dragged on board through the sea The case of one of these poor fellows who was above years of age was singular As he had been endeavouring to extinguish the fire in the cupola where it first raged and was looking up the melted lead from the roof came trickling down upon his face and shoulders At Plymouth he was put into a surgeon's hands and though much hurt he appeared to be in no danger He constantly however affirmed that some of the melted lead had fallen down his throat This was not believed as it was thought he could not have survived such a  circumstance In twelve days he died and Mr Smeaton says he saw the lead after it had been taken out of his stomach and that it weighed seven ounces  See Mr Smeaton's Account of the Edystone    The next lighthouse which is the present one was built by Mr Smeaton and is con∣structed on a plan which it is hoped will se∣cure it against every danger It is built entirely of stone in a circular form Its foundations are let into a socket in the rock on which it stands and of which it almost makes a part for the stones are all united with the rock and with each other by massy dovetails The ce∣ment used in this curious masonry is the lime of Watchet  See page  from whence Mr Smeaton con∣trived to bring it barrelled up in cydercasks for the proprietors will not suffer it to be ex∣ported in its crude state The door of this in∣genious piece of architecture is only the size of a ship's gunport and the windows are mere loopholes denying light to exclude wind When the tide swells above the foundation of the building the light house makes the odd ap∣pearance of a structure emerging from the waves But sometimes a wave rises above the  very top of it and circling round the whole looks like a column of water till it breaks into foam and subsides  The care of this important beacon is com∣mitted to four men two of whom take the charge of it by turns and are relieved every six weeks But as it often happens especially in stormy weather that boats cannot touch at the Edystone for many months a proper quan∣tity of salt provision is always laid up as in a ship victualled for a long voyage In high winds such a briny atmosphere surrounds this gloomy solitude from the dashing of the waves that a man exposed to it could not draw his breath At these dreadful intervals the two forlorn inhabitants keep close quarters and are obliged to live in darkness and stench listen∣ing to the howling storm excluded in every emergency from the least hope of assistance and without any earthly comfort but what is administered from their confidence in the strength of the building in which they are im∣mured Once on relieving this forlorn guard one of the men was found dead his compa∣nion chusing rather to shut himself up with a putrifying carcase than by throwing it into the sea to incur the suspicion of murder In  fine weather these wretched beings just scram∣ble a little about the edge of the rock when the tide ebbs and amuse themselves with fishing which is the only employment they have ex∣cept that of trimming their nightly fires  Such total inaction and entire seclusion from all the joys and aids of society can only be endured by great religious philosophy which we cannot imagine they feel or by great stu∣pidity which in pity we must suppose they possess  Yet though this wretched community is so small we were assured it is generally a scene of misanthropy Instead of suffering the recol∣lection of those distresses and dangers in which each is deserted by all but one to endear that one to him we were informed the humours of each were so soured that they preyed both on themselves and on each other If one sat above the other was commonly found below Their meals too were solitary each like a brute growling over his food alone  We are sorry to acknowledge a picture like this to be a likeness of human nature In some gentle minds we see the kind affections  rejoice  in being beckoned even from scenes of inno∣cence  mirth and gaiety to mingle the sympa∣thetic tear with affliction and distress But ex∣perience shews us that the heart of man is equally susceptible of the malevolent affections and religion joins in confirming the melan∣choly truth The  picturesque eye  in the mean∣time surveys natural and moral evil under characters entirely different Darken the storm let loose the winds let the waves overwhelm all that is fair and good the storm will be sub∣lime and the catastrophe pathetic while the moral tempest is dreary without grandeur and the catastrophe afflicting without one pictu∣resque idea  The emolument of this arduous post is twenty pounds a year and provisions while on duty The house to live in may be fairly thrown into the bargain The whole together is perhaps one of the least eligible pieces of preferment in Britain and yet from a story which Mr Smeaton relates it appears there are stations still more ineligible A fellow who got a good livelihood by making leathernpipes for engines grew tired of sitting constantly at work and solicited a lighthouse man's place which as competitors are not numerous he  obtained As the Edystoneboat was carrying him to take possession of his new habitation one of the boatmen asked him what could tempt him to give up a profitable business to be shut up for months together in a pillar "Why" said the man  because I did not like con∣finement  SECT XXIV  AT Plymouth we heard much of the scenery upon the Tamer of which we had had a little specimen at Axworthy  See page  We resolved therefore to navigate that river as far as the Weir which is about twentytwo miles above Plymouth and as far as we could have the ad∣vantage of the tide Procuring therefore a good boat and four stout hands from the Ocean man of war then lying in the Hamoaz we set sail with a flowing tide  The river Tamer rises from the mountains of Hartland near Barnstaplebay in the north of Devonshire and taking its course almost due south divides that county from Cornwall No river can be a more complete boundary As it approaches Plymouth it becomes a noble estuary The Hamoaz is esteemed after Ports∣mouth the best station for ships of war upon the British coast This grand bay which was the first scene we investigated on the Tamer is  about a mile in breadth and seven miles in length though the larger ships we observed seldom to anchor above a league from the sea Its banks on each side though rather low are by no means flat They are generally culti∣vated and the shore is finished by a narrow edging of rock  The next view we had of any consequence was the opening towards St German's on the left This is a creek about three leagues in length The woods of Anthony occupy one side of the opening and a house which appeared at a distance in the centre is Ince a seat of the Killigrews  Soon after we came in sight of Saltash which stands high but affords no very pic∣turesque appearance When we crossed the ferry the day before the views of the creek from the hill presented a beautiful scene both above and below the town  See page  but when the eye is stationed  upon  the water the retiring reaches of the river are lost and the landscape is much impaired  Our next scene was the opening of the Tavey into the Tamer Sir Harry Trelaw∣ney's  house was one of the principal objects of this view The distance was composed chiefly of the Dartmore hills The banks of the Tamer were still low and cultivated and bore no proportion to the extent of the water which did not begin to contract itself nor the banks to swell till we had proceeded nine or ten miles up the river  The first scene which in any degree en∣gaged our attention was composed of the woods of Pentilly on the Cornish side The house too is a good object and a building at the bottom of the bank has a picturesque ap∣pearance though its dignity was degraded when we learned it was only a limekiln Lime is the chief commodity of trade on this river employing many large boats in transporting it and the limekilns which we see in many places on its banks are of such noble dimen∣sions that they may at a little distance be mis∣taken for castles without any imputation on the understanding They are among the greatest ornaments of the river The back∣ground of the scenery of Pentilly is a lofty bank adorned with a tower to which belongs a history  Mr Tilly once the owner of Pentillyhouse was a celebrated atheist of the last age He was a man of wit and had by rote all the ri∣baldry and commonplace jests against religion and scripture which are well suited to display pertness and folly and to unsettle a giddy mind but are offensive to men of sense what∣ever their opinions may be and are neither in∣tended nor adapted to investigate truth The brilliancy of Mr Tilly's wit however carried him a degree farther than we often meet with in the annals of prophaneness In general the witty atheist is satisfied with entertaining his  contemporaries  but Mr Tilly wished to have his sprightliness known to  posterity  With this view in ridicule of the resurrection he obliged his executors to place his dead body in his usual garb and in his elbowchair upon the top of a hill and to arrange on a table be∣fore him bottles glasses pipes and tobacco In this situation he ordered himself to be im∣mured in a tower of such dimensions as he prescribed where he proposed he said pati∣ently to wait the event All this was done and the tower still inclosing its tenant remains as a monument of his impiety and prophane∣ness  The country people shudder as they go near it  Religio pavidos terrebat agrestes  Dira locisylvam saxumque tremebant  As we sailed farther up the river we came in view of the rocks and woods of Coteil which are still on the Cornish side and afford some beautiful scenery Here we had grand sweeping hills covered with wood At the bottom of one of them stands a noble limekilncastle which is relieved by a lofty back∣ground  Near the bottom of another stands a small Gothic ruin situated with much picturesque beauty in a woody recess It was formerly a votive chapel built by a chief of the Coteil fa∣mily though some say by one of the Edg∣combs Its founder had engaged on the unsuc∣cessful side during one of the periods of the dubious wars of York and Lancaster His party being beaten he fled for his life and as he was a man of consequence was closely pur∣sued The Tamer opposed his flight He made a short vow to the Virgin Mary threw himself into the river and swam safe to the promontory before which we now lay on our  oars His upper garment which he had thrown off floated down the stream and giving occa∣sion to believe he had perished checked the ardour of pursuit In the mean time Coteil lurked in his own woods till a happier mo∣ment and in the day of security raised this chapel to the holy Virgin his protectress who had the full honour of his escape  We have the story sometimes told other∣wise and given to the times of Charles I but a story of so late a date one should ima∣gine might have been better ascertained than this seems to be and if the chapel have any connection with the story it is much more credible that a votivechapel should have been erected in the th century when we know they were common than in the th when such structures were never heard of  At Coteilhouse we landed which is entirely surrounded with wood and shut out from the river If it were a little opened it might both see and be seen to advantage To the river particularly it would present a good object as it stands on a bold knoll and is built in the form of a castle But it is a deserted mansion and occupied only as a farmhouse Here we re∣freshed ourselves with tea and larded our bread  after the fashion of the country with clouted cream  Round this old mansion grew some noble trees and among them the Spanish chesnut full grown and spread out in huge massy limbs We thought these chesnuts scarce in∣ferior in grandeur to the proudest oaks The chesnut on which Salvator Rosa has hung Edipus is exactly one of them  We had now sailed a considerable way up the Tamer and during the whole voyage had been almost solely obliged to the Cornish shores for amusement But the Devonshire coast as if only collecting its strength burst out upon us at Calstock in a grander dis∣play of lofty banks adorned with wood and rock than any we had yet seen and continued without interruption through the space of a league  But it is impossible to describe scenes which though  strongly marked  have no  peculiar  fea∣tures In Nature these lofty banks are infi∣nitely varied The face of each rock is differ∣ent it projects differently it is naked or it is adorned or if adorned its ornaments are of different kinds In short Nature's variations are as infinite on the face of a rock as in the  face of a man Each requires a distinct por∣trait to characterize it justly while language can no more give you a full idea of one than it can of the other  With the views of Calstock we finished our voyage up the Tamer and though the banks of the river were diversified both with rocks and woods with open and contracted country yet considering the space through which we had sailed and the high commendations we had heard of this river it was on the whole less a scene of amusement than we had expected to find it We had a few grand views but in general the navigators of the Tamer find only some of the common characteristics of a river  Longos superant flexus variisque teguntur  Arboribus viridesque secant placido aequore sylvas  All is beautiful sylvan and highly pleasing but if you ask what we saw we can only say  in ge∣neral  that we saw rocks trees groves and woods In short the whole is amusing but not picturesque it is not sufficiently divided into portions adapted to the pencil  The scenery itself on the banks of the Ta∣mer is certainly good but had it even been better the form of the river could not have  shewn it to much picturesque advantage The reaches are commonly too long and admit lit∣tle winding We rarely trace the course of the river by the perspective of one skreen be∣hind another which in river views is often a beautiful circumstance and yet if one of the banks be lofty broken into large parts and fall∣ing away in good perspective the length of the reach may possibly be an advantage In some parts of the Tamer we had this grand lengthened view but in other parts we wished to have had its continued reaches more con∣tracted  These remarks however it must be observed affect a river only in  navigating  it When we are thus on a  level  with its surface we have rarely more than a foreground at most we have only a first distance But when we take a higher stand and view a remote river lofty banks become then an incumbrance and in∣stead of discovering they hide its winding course When the distance becomes still more remote the valley through which the river winds should be open and the country flat to produce the most pleasing effect  In the immense rivers that traverse conti∣nents these ideas are all lost As you sail up  such a vast surface of water as the Mississippi for instance the first striking observation is that perspective views are entirely out of the question If you wish to examine either of its shores you must desert the main channel and knowing that you are in a river make to one side or the other  As you approach within half a league of one of the sides you will perhaps see stretches of sandbanks or islands covered with wood extending along the shore beyond the reach of the eye which have been formed by de∣predations made on the coast by the river for when the winds rage this vast surface of water is agitated like a sea and has the same power over its shores As the trees of these regions are in as grand a style as the rivers themselves you sometimes see vast excavations where the water has undermined the banks in which im∣mense roots are laid bare and being washed clean from the soil appear twisted into various forms like the gates of a cathedral  Though the banks of the Mississippi we are told are generally flat you frequently see beau∣tiful scenery upon them Among the vast woods which adorn them are many groves of cypresses to which a creeping plant called  the Liane is often attached What kind of flower it bears I have not heard but if it be not too profuse it must be very ornamental hang∣ing from tree to tree and connecting a whole cypressgrove together with rich festoons  These woods are interspersed also with lawns where you see the wild deer of the country feeding in herds As they espy the vessel glid∣ing past they all raise their heads at once and standing a moment with pricked ears in amazement they turn suddenly round and darting across the plain hide themselves in the woods  From scenes of this kind as you coast the river you come perhaps to low marshy grounds where swamps overgrown with reeds and rushes but of enormous growth ex∣tend through endless tracts which a day's sail∣ing cannot leave behind In these marshes the alligator is often seen basking near the edge of the river into which he instantly plunges on the least alarm or perhaps you descry his hide∣ous form creeping along the sedges sometimes hid and sometimes discovered as he moves through a closer or more open path  Contrasts like these between the Tamer and the Mississippi are amusing and set each scene  off to more advantage The Tamer may be called a noble river but what is it in point of grandeur when compared with the Mississippi which at the distance of two thousand miles from the sea is a wider stream than the Tamer where it falls into it On the other hand though the Mississippi no doubt has its beauty yet as a river it loses as much in this respect when compared with the Tamer as it gained in point of grandeur In the Mississippi you seek in vain for the rocky banks and winding shores which adorn the Tamer and are the glory of riverscenery  To these contrasts I shall just add one more As Lord Macartney and his suit in their way to Canton sailed down one of the rivers of China they passed under a rock of grey mar∣ble which arose from the water to the amaz∣ing perpendicular height of six hundred feet It was shagged with wood and continued va∣rying its form but still preserving its immen∣sity through the space of at least two miles In some parts its summit beetled frightfully over the river and gave an involuntary shud∣der to the passenger as he passed under its tre∣mendous shade  SECT XXV  AS we were leaving Plymouth the town was greatly agitated with an account received that morning of the battle of Lexington which happened on the th of April We had been chiefly in company with General Bell of the marines and as a large detachment from that corps was with the troops in America the ge∣neral's house was crowded with people inquir∣ing after their relations and friends while they who looked farther conceived that as blood was now drawn all hope of accommo∣dation was over  We left Plymouth under the impression of these melancholy ideas till a succession of new objects dislodged them By the Ashburton road we took our route to Exeter  About three miles from Plymouth stands Salterham the seat of Mr Parker It is Mount Edgcomb in miniature being situated on a  small peninsula and surrounded not indeed by the sea but by a considerable creek  Mr Parker commands a view of St Ni∣cholas's island Mount Edgcomb and the Ram'shead but though the objects are great they did not appear to us either picturesque in themselves or agreeably combined The ground particularly beyond the creek is ill shaped  The soil of Salterham seems as unkindly to vegetation as Mount Edgcomb is friendly to it and the creek it stands on is entirely for∣saken by the tide at ebb and becomes a mere channel of ooze Perhaps in our remarks here we were too much under the impression of the gloomy ideas we had brought from Ply∣mouth  From Salterham we pursued our route to Ivybridge where as far as we could judge from the appearance of the river we should have met with some beautiful scenery if we had had time to examine it  From hence we proceeded to Ashburton which lies among hills and Chudleigh where  are stonequarries which at a distance have the appearance of a grand range of natural rock Here the bishops of Exeter formerly resided The ruins of the episcopal palace may still be traced  We were but little amused however with any thing we saw in this country The whole of it from Plymouth is but an uninteresting scene Its very appearance on a map shews in some degree its unpicturesque form It is in∣tersected with several rivers which run in val∣lies between opposite hills These hills we were continually ascending or descending When we had mounted one hill we were pre∣sented with the side of another so that all dis∣tance was shut out and all variety of country intercepted A pleasant glade here and there at the dip of a hill we sometimes had but this did not compensate for that tiresome sameness of ascent and descent which runs through the country  At Chudleigh we left the great Exeterroad to see Mamhead and Powderhamcastle In our  way we mounted a sort of grand natural  ter∣race  about seven miles in length and three in breadth though this indeed is a broader sur∣face than we commonly distinguish by that ap∣pellation The name of this eminence is Hal∣downhill  From hence we had a grand extensive and in many parts a picturesque distance consist∣ing first of the whole course of the Ex from Exeter to the sea the city of Exeter the town of Topsham Sir Francis Drake's and Powder∣hamcastle Beyond these objects all of which seemed in the distance to adorn the banks of the river the eye ranged over immense plains and woods hills and vales Of these the vale of Honiton and other celebrated vales made a part But they were mere specks too incon∣siderable for the eye to fix on Distance had pressed all the hilly boundaries of these vales flat to the surface At least it had so dimi∣nished them that the proudest appeared only as a ripple on the ocean The extreme parts of this vast landscape were bounded by the long range of Sedburyhills which were tinged when we saw them with a light ether hue scarce one shade removed from the colour  of the sky the whole immense scene there∣fore without the least interruption from the hills of the country faded gradually into air  A view of this kind gives us a just idea of the surface of the globe we inhabit We talk of its inequalities in a lofty stile Its mountains ascend the skies its vallies sink down into depths profound Whereas in fact its ine∣qualities are nothing when compared with its magnitude If a comprehensive eye placed at a distance from the surface of the earth were capable of viewing a whole hemisphere toge∣ther all its inequalities great as we make them Mount Caucasus the Andes Teneriffe and all the loftiest mountains of the globe would be compressed like the view before us and the whole would appear perfectly smooth To us a bowling green is a level plain but a minute insect finds it full of inequalities  In surveying the windings of the Ex in its course to the sea we are reminded of a sketch by a great master of the course of Aufente It is slightly touched indeed but with great spi∣rit and the distances are particularly well  marked We have it at the end of the seventh Aeneid where the picturesque poet led by his subject to mention some of the countries of Italy gives us this pleasing view  Queis Jupiter Anxurus arvis  Praesidet et viridi gaudens Feronia luco  Qua Saturae jacet atra palus gelidusque per imas  Quaerit iter valles atque in mare conditur Ufens  In this landscape we have first the foreground composed of the Temple of Jupiter Anxur proudly seated and overlooking the neigh∣bouring country  Queis Jupiter Anxurus arvis  Praesidet  The immediate distance consists of the Temple of Feronia marked by a grove which adorns it and a lake lying at its foot  Viridi gaudens Feronia luco  Qua Saturae jacet atra palus  The lake to which the poet gives the epithet  atra  had that deep black clear hue which Claude and Poussin well knew produced often the best effect In the second distance all  co∣lour  is gone and the fading landscape of course takes its aërial tinge It is enough now if a few principal objects are dimly seen A wind∣ing  river is the most distinguishable It is dis∣covered only by its meanders along the plain  Gelidusque per imas  Quaerit iter valles  It has not its course shaped out between high banks but  seeks out  its passage here and there as the small depressions of a flat country allow Beyond all appears the sea but the distance here is so remote that it is not marked with any degree of strength no epithet is applied you can scarce distinguish it from the sky Criticisms of this kind may seem refinement but there is little doubt I think but the poet in composing these lines had some real land∣scape strongly formed in his imagination Chance could not have marked all these dis∣tances so very exactly  Having descended Haldownhill we saw Mamhead the seat of Lord Lisburne and Powderhamcastle though we had no time to examine either  The former from a woody hill which seems to be adorned with much beautiful scenery commands a noble view over the mouth of the Ex The latter stands on a knoll overlooking  a flat park bounded by the same river but with a less amusing view of it The Ex in both these views is a grand tide channel and in the former especially is very beautiful But we saw nothing in the distance either from Mamhead or Powderhamcastle which Haldownhill had not already shewn us though not in all respects perhaps to so much advantage  SECT XXVI  THE city of Exeter which we soon reached is by far the most considerable town in the west of England It is seated rather eminently on the eastern side of the Ex From this river it derives its name which is a corruption of Ex∣cester or the castle on the Ex a name which gives it a title to Roman origin The anti∣quarian however is not obliged merely to ety∣mology for his proof of its antiquity He points out vestiges of Roman masonry in the south gate he finds variety of coins and he measures the length and breadth of the walls which form a parallelogram by Roman feet  Exeter is said to be very regularly built having two large airy streets running through the length and breadth of it and uniting in the centre It appeared to us however very in∣cumbered We were directed from the bridge to the great church through close and disagree∣able alleys The best part of the town we did not see as our time allowed us to examine only the most remarkable buildings  On the north side the highest ground is oc∣cupied by the ruins of Rugementcastle for∣merly the residence of Saxon kings From the terrace of this castle and from the walls of the town we had the same extensive view over the country which we had before from Haldownhill but as we now saw them from a different station and from a lower point they were less grand but more picturesque Hills which were there compressed to the surface began here to arise and take their form in the land∣scape breaking the continued lines of distance and creating new lights and new shades with their varied elevations Towards the mouth of the river we were told a light mist often prevails when the rest of the landscape to∣wards the west is perfectly clear We did not see any appearance of this kind but I should suppose it might frequently produce a good effect not only from the beauty of the mist it∣self but from its clearing away  See page  and leaving some objects distinctly seen and others but ob∣scurely traced  The good Bishop Rundle who was educated in this town speaks with picturesque warmth  of the views from its public walks and the great beauty of the landscape around it The climate he affirms to be so fine that in no part of England trees shoot with more luxu∣riance or fruits ripen to a richer flavour The fig and the grape he says scarce desire better skies  See Letters of the late T Rundle LLD    Few places in England are more renowned in the annals of war than Exeter It was three times besieged by the Danes once by William the Conqueror again by King Stephen a sixth time in the rebellion of Perkin Warbec in the time of Henry VII again in a rebellion which broke out in the reign of Edward VI and two or three times more in the civil wars of Charles I On many of these occasions it was regularly garrisoned and the citizens had nothing to do with its defence But when it rested on  them  they generally behaved with re∣markable spirit Many instances of their gal∣lantry are preserved in history Henry VII was so much pleased with their behaviour in his time that he paid them a visit on purpose to thank them and when he left the town he took his sword from his side and presenting it  to the Mayor desired it might always be car∣ried before him which it has been ever since  The history of the great church at Exeter is remarkable It was four hundred years in building under the direction of several bishops each adding something to complete the design one of them even lengthened the nave of the church by two additional arches Yet not∣withstanding this lapse of time in which the fashion of architecture underwent so much change and notwithstanding the different ar∣chitects employed whose genius and taste must have been very different it is singular that each succeeding bishop hath so attentively pur∣sued the plan of his predecessor that the whole together strikes the eye as a uniform building On examining the parts nicely we may here and there distinguish the opposition of Saxon and Gothic but in general they accord very happily The west front is uncommonly rich and adorned with figures The nave of the church is fitted up for divine service which may be useful but injures the effect  The curious should not forget before he leave the church to see the chalice and sap∣phire ring which were dug out of a bishop's grave when a new pavement was laid about  twenty years ago To what bishop the ring belonged is only guessed but it might be tole∣rably ascertained by a knowledge of the pro∣gress of art which some antiquarians possess Such a knowledge gives the form and work∣manship of these curious remains of antiquity to their proper period If the traveller have a mind also to please his conductor who leads him through the aisles of the church he may tell him he has heard that the great bell called Peter weighs above a thousand pounds more than Great Tom at Lincoln and that the pipes of the organ are wider than those of any organ in Europe Both these accounts he will pro∣bably hear confirmed with great solemnity though the latter of them is a mistake and as to the former both it and its rival at Lincoln are mere handbells compared with the great bell at Moscow which weighs pounds and measures at its mouth above twentyone yards  SECT XXVII  FROM Exeter to Honiton we passed through a rich country yet somewhat flatter than we had met with on the western side of Exeter We found however here and there an emi∣nence which gave us a view of the distances around At Fairmilehill particularly a very  extensive  view opened before us but nothing can make it pleasing as it is  bounded by a hard edge  A distance should either melt into the sky or terminate in a soft and varied moun∣tain line  See page    This high ground which appeared at a  dis∣tance  as a  hard edge  is on the spot a grand ter∣race running eight or nine miles from Honi∣ton to Sidmouth presenting sometimes the sea and sometimes a variety of hills vales and dis∣tances with which the country abounds We had not time however to explore the several beauties of the landscape it overlooks Night came on before we reached Honiton and drew a veil over all the objects of the horizon  At Honiton we intended to sleep but it was ordered otherwise This town having been twice burnt down within these last thirty years the inhabitants take a very effectual me∣thod to prevent the catastrophe a third time by appointing all travellers to the office of watchmen About twelve o'clock a fellow begins his operations with a monstrous handbell and a hoarse voice informing us that all is safe This serenade is repeated every quar∣ter of an hour with great propriety for in that portion of time it may reasonably be sup∣posed the traveller who is ignorant of the in∣stitution and not accustomed to such nocturnal∣din in a countrytown cannot well get his senses composed especially as his ear will naturally lie in expectation of each periodical peal In the mean time the sly inhabitant who is used to these noises of the night enjoys a quiet repose The institution may be good we only wished it had been intimated to us before that we might have had an option in the case  We had now travelled between seventy and eighty miles from Plymouth and found the whole of the country except the little devi∣ation  we made from Chudleigh to examine the scenery about the Ex unvaried and unin∣teresting Like an immense piece of high furrowed land at least as far as Exeter it is continually rising and falling and though it has its beauties yet they are chiefly seen near the coast where its vallies break down and open to the sea and where its estuaries often form very pleasing scenes  The road from Plymouth to Honiton by the  seacoast  was the road we ought to have taken but as it had not been pointed out to us as particularly picturesque we took the upper road merely for want of better information I shall however give the reader a sketch of the  coast  from some hints which I have had on good picturesque authority I have also my∣self seen a great variety of accurate drawings of this coast which have given me a strong idea of its character  SECT XXVIII  FROM Plymouth according to this route you make the first stage to Totness and so far the country wears nearly the same face which it did between Plymouth and Ash∣burton You cross the same rivers ascend the same hills and fall into the same vallies  This is a country however in which the farmer glories though the painter treats it with neglect Here the acre fills the bushel with abundant increase and here the ox does credit to his pasture But though the country abounds in corn and pasturage cyder is its staple The cyder of the South Hams which is the name of a great part of this country is every where famous  At Totness you meet the Dart down which river you may sail about six or seven miles to Dartmouth This little navigation I have heard much extolled as a peculiar scene of beauty but I have heard others on whose judgment I can more rely speak of it with less emotion And yet I can easily imagine  that two people of equally picturesque taste may conceive differently of the same scene They may have different conceptions of beauty though the conceptions of each may be very just or they may examine the same scene under different circumstances A favourable or an unfavourable light makes a greater alter∣ation in any scene than a person unaccustomed to examine nature would easily imagine  At Dartmouth you have a great variety of interesting views The bay which the river forms at its mouth is one of the most beautiful scenes on the coast Both the entrance of the Dart into it and its exit to the sea appear from many stations closed up by the folding of the banks so that the bay has frequently the form of a lake only furnished with shipping instead of boats Its banks are its great beauty which consist of lofty wooded hills shelving down in all directions You would not ex∣pect such scenery on a seacoast but the woods by being well sheltered grow luxuriantly  And yet an eye versed in the various scenes of nature would easily distinguish these bays from the pastoral simplicity of an inlandlake The sea always impresses a peculiar character on its bays The water has a different aspect  its tints are more varied and its surface differ∣ently disturbed Its banks too have a more weatherbeaten and ragged appearance losing generally their verdure within the air of the sea The searock also wants that rich incrus∣tation of mosses and lychens which adorns the rock of the lake and the wood though it grow luxuriantly as it does here shews plainly by its mode of growth that it is the inhabitant of a seagirt clime To this may be added that the appendages of the bay and lake are dif∣ferent A quay perhaps for landing goods an anchor a floating buoy or a group of figures in seamen's jackets are the ornaments of one scene but unknown to the other  The bay in the mean time may be as pic∣turesque as the lake All I mean to point out is that the  character  of each is different and therefore in painting they should not be con∣founded Its  particular value  each receives from the fancy of the spectator As was just observed people may have different concep∣tions of beauty and yet the conceptions of both may be equally just The pastoral simplicity of the lake may please one person and the bustle of the bay another I shall only add that representations of the two scenes are ex∣ceedingly  well suited as companions to each other  At the opening of Dartmouthbay to the sea appears the town of Dartmouth ascending a hill Its castle at the distance of a mile stands close to the water's edge On the other side across the bay rises Kingswere a sort of suburb belonging to the town The winding of the bay and the varied beauty of its banks are seen to great advantage in a walk which carries you from the town of Dartmouth to the castle  All this coast affords excellent fish The sole breeds here in great abundance and the john dory delights in it as its most favourite haunt The Torbayboat often brings this delicious fish to the tables of the luxurious but the epicure who wishes to eat it in per∣fection does not think a journey to these coasts too much At Totness great quantities of salmonpeal are taken in an uncommon mode of fishing The fish are intercepted as the water ebbs by dogs which swim∣ming after the shoal are taught to drive them up the river into close nets provided to receive them  Dartmouth harbour is a very busy scene when a shoal of pilchards enters it as they often do at particular seasons driven in by porpoises which lie off at sea in expectation of them The shoal discovers itself by the tre∣mulous motion of the water and the leaping of the fish here and there on the surface On this appearance every boat that can swim puts off from the shore with nets The whole would make a busy and entertaining water scene if it were well painted  From Dartmouth you return with the tide tide to Totness From thence in the way to Brixham you may visit the grand ruins of BerryPomeroycastle This fortress belonged formerly to a family of the name of Pomeroy which being seated there by the Conqueror kept possession of it during all the various re∣volutions of England till the reign of Ed∣ward VI It was once a formidable place and its ruins are still magnificent The grand gateway remains entire together with a round tower A great part of the wall is standing and many of the chambers may be traced  From hence you proceed to Brixham where the naturalist finds himself puzzled with a well  which ebbs and flows though the waters are not in the least brackish but pure and limpid which seems to indicate they have no commu∣nication with tides  Near Brixham you begin to skirt that cele∣brated inlet of the sea called Torbay It is a grand scene and affords many magnificent views if you have leisure to circle the bay in quest of them  Its general form is semilunar inclosing a cir∣cumference of about twelve miles Its wind∣ing shores on both sides are skreened with grand ramparts of rock between which in the central part the ground from the country forming a gentle vale falls easily to the water's edge Wood grows all round the bay even on its  rocky sides  where it can get footing and shelter but in the  central part  with great lux∣uriance  In this delicious spot stood formerly Torabbey the ruins of which still remain Its situ∣ation was grand and beautiful Wooded hills descending on every side skreened and adorned it both behind and on its flanks In front the bay opening before it spread its circling rocky cheeks like a vast colonade lessening in all the pleasing forms of perspective and receiving  all the variety of light and shade which the sun veering round from morning till evening throws upon them Here a society of monks dwelt in peaceful security The enemy's fleet more than once in former times ravaged the coast and burnt Dartmouth and other towns The abbey feared no mischief All it had to do was to open its hospitable gates and give an asylum to the terrified fugitives of the country  This noble bay has afforded its protection many a time to the fleets of England which in their full array ride safely within its ample bason But it appeared in its greatest glory on the fifth of November when King William entered it with fifty sail of the line and four hundred transports The ships in∣deed were Dutch but a British admiral led the van and a British flag flew at the masthead  From Torbay your next stage is NewtonBushel where crossing the Teign you ride along the banks of that river to Teignmouth In your way you are entertained with a variety of river views But Nature laying aside here in a great degree her rocks and bold shores works with softer materials The banks of the  Teign I understand are rather cultivated than wild though at its mouth it receives the sea with rocks which are both magnificent and beautiful They are covered like the genera∣lity of the rocks on this coast with a profusion of wood  From Teignmouth you skirt the shore to the mouth of the Ex over which you ferry at the bar Here the country grows somewhat bolder but rather in the form of swelling hills These hills likewise are profusely covered with wood which sweeps almost down to the water's edge But as you take a view of them with your back to the sea they appear in still greater magnificence uniting with the woods of the country Those of Powderhamcastle receive them first and beyond these you see rising and stretching into distance the woods of Mamhead in rich though indistinct luxuriance  The Ex is by far the noblest river in this part of the coast It empties a profuse chan∣nel into the sea and forms a bason at its mouth which would be an excellent harbour for a royal navy if it were not obstructed by a bar When the tide flows however ships of con∣siderable burthen advance as far as Topsham and could formerly have proceeded with equal  ease to the walls of Exeter but a little above Topsham the channel of the river is again ob∣structed  The tradition of the country ascribes this obstruction to a quarrel between the Mayor of Exeter and an Earl of Devonshire The earl claimed the first salmon that was taken in the season as an acknowledgment of his juris∣diction over the river The mayor claimed it as a perquisite of his office The earl's claim appears to have been worse founded because instead of appealing to the laws for redress he had recourse to private revenge Both sides of the river were his property and both sides closely wooded with ancient oak These trees he cut down in abundance and threw them into the channel of the river The tide after∣wards carrying up with it great quantities of sand and gravel formed this obstruction by degrees into such a barrier as could never afterwards be removed If this tradition be well grounded we have seldom an instance of revenge in so grand a style Most people who seek gratifications of this kind are satisfied with revenging themselves on the person who had offended them But the Earl of Devon∣shire not only revenged himself on the Mayor  of Exeter but on the whole city and for all future times  About seventy years ago the inhabitants of Exeter cut a new channel for the river and built very expensive locks upon it by means of which they can now bring vessels of some burthen to the town  From the mouth of the Ex the coast affords nothing very interesting till you come to the mouth of the Sid This river opens into the sea between high promontories that on the west is particularly lofty and much broken though not rocky and is represented as afford∣ing many picturesque views But here is no bason opening into the land as in the other rivers of this coast The Sid is a mere rural stream and preserves its character pure to the very shores of the ocean  The valley through which it takes its course is a scene of peculiar construction It forms a gentle descent towards the sea between two steep hills which leave little more room at the bottom than what the road and the river oc∣cupy So that in fact it has hardly the dimensions of a valley but might rather be called a cleft in the higher grounds running down to the sea The hills however which  compose its sides are not like the narrow vallies of a mountainous and rocky country ab∣rupt and broken but consist chiefly of rich pasturage and are covered with flocks and herds They are adorned too with wood and though in their course they now and then wind a little they generally lead the valley in a straight line from north to south  Through this narrow valley you rise slowly near the space of nine miles So long an as∣cent though in all parts gradual raises you at length to a great height At the conclusion of the valley you find yourself on a lofty down from whence you have some of the grandest views which this country rich in distances affords You look chiefly towards the west and take in an amazing compass indeed all the district on both sides of the Ex as far as the sea These high grounds formed that  hard edge  and made that peculiar appearance which we observed in the road between Exeter and Honiton  See page  From these lofty downs you de∣scend gently into Honiton where these two different routes from Plymouth unite  SECT XXIX  AS we left Honiton the obscurity of a hazy morning overspread its vale the pictu∣resque beauty of which we had heard much commended If therefore it possesses any which from the analogy of the country may be questioned we are not qualified to give any account of it A misty morning in gene∣ral gives new beauty to a country but we must catch its beautiful appearance as we do all the other  accidental  appearances of Nature at a proper crisis We left Honiton at too early an hour in the morning to see the full effect of the mist It rather blotted out than adorned the face of the country The most picturesque moment of a misty morning is just as the sun rises and begins its contention with the vapours which obstruct its rays That ap∣pearance we had soon after and in such profu∣sion that it gave a beautiful effect to a land∣scape which seemed not calculated to produce much effect without it  We have a striking picture of a morningsun though unaccompanied by mist in the short account given us of Lot's escape from Sodom We are told  The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar  Descrip∣tive poetry and painting must both have  objects of sense  before them Neither of them deals in  abstracted ideas  But the same objects will not always suit both Images which may shine under the poet's description are not per∣haps at the same time picturesque though I believe every picturesque object is capable of shining as a poetical one The passage before us is both poetical and picturesque A relation of the plain fact would have been neither If the passage had been coldly translated  Lot ar∣rived at Zoar about sunrise  the sense had been preserved but the picture would have been lost As it is translated the whole is imagery The first part of the expression  the sun was risen upon the earth  brings immediately before the eye through the  connection  of the sun and the earth the rays of a morning sun striking the tops of the hills and promontories while the other part of the expression  Lot entered into Zoar  brings before us through the same  happy mode of raising and connecting images a road the gates of the town and the patriarch approaching it Not by the way that we should wish to introduce the  story  of Lot's retreat with any  distinction  into the picture The prin∣cipal part would be the  landscape  and Lot could only be a distant figure to adorn it and in that light unnecessary  History  introduced as the  ornament of landscape  appears absurd In Basson and some other matters such intro∣ductions are frequent We consider there∣fore the passage before us merely as  landscape  and lay little stress on the  figures  Reubens has thrown a fine glow of colouring into a picture on this subject in the possession of the Duke of Marlbrough But Reubens has in∣troduced as he ought the figures on the  foreground  making the landscape entirely an  un∣derpart  I forget whether he has given his picture the full effect it might receive by throwing the back scenery into that grand shade suggested by the words of scripture the  smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace  The atmosphere also might have a good effect tinged with the ruddy glare of fire blended with the smoke  As the mist cleared away and we saw more of the country around its picturesque charms did not increase upon us If the hills and dales however of which the whole country is composed possess little of this kind of beauty they possess what is better the riches of soil and cultivation in a high degree If any val∣lies can be said to  laugh and sing  these certainly may Nothing can exceed either their tillage or their pasturage  Among the beautiful objects we occasion∣ally met with in this country the cattle which every where grazed its rich pastures were worthy of remark Most of those we saw seemed to be of a peculiar breed elegantly and neatly formed rather small generally red growing gradually darker towards the head and shoulders Their horns which are short are tipped with black their coats are fine and their heads small  At Axminster the carpetworks are worth visiting Some of them display a very rich combination of colours but in general they are so gay that furniture must be glaring to be  in harmony with them Of course they are too gay to be beautiful  No carpeting perhaps equals the Persian in beauty The Turkey carpet is modest enough in its colouring but its texture is coarse and its pattern consists commonly of such a jumble of incoherent parts that the eye seldom traces any meaning in its plan The British carpet again has  too much meaning  It often repre∣sents fruits and flowers and baskets and other things which are generally ill represented or awkwardly larger than the life or at least im∣properly placed under our feet The Persian carpet avoids these two extremes It seldom exhibits any  real forms  and yet instead of the disorderly pattern that deforms the Turkey carpet it usually presents some neat and ele∣gant plan within the compartments of which its colours though rich are modest The tex∣ture also of the carpet is as neat and elegant as the ornamental scrawl which adorns it  SECT XXX  FROM Axminster we left the great road to visit Fordabbey  In a sequestered part of the country where Devonshire and Dorsetshire unite lies a cir∣cular valley about a mile and half in diameter  Its sides slope gently into its area in various directions but are no where steep Woody skreens circling its precincts conceal its bounds and in many parts connecting with the trees which descend into the bosom of the valley form themselves into various tufted groves Through the middle of this sweet retreat winds a stream not foaming among broken rocks nor sounding down cataracts but mild like the scene it accompanies and in cadence not ex∣ceeding a gentle murmur From this retreat all foreign scenery is excluded It wants no adventitious ornaments sufficiently blessed with its own sweet groves and solitude  Such  landscape  Needs not the foreign aid of ornament  But is when unadorned adorned the most  This happy retirement was once sacred to religion Verging towards one side of the valley stand the ruins of Fordabbey It has never been of large dimensions but was a model of the most perfect Gothic if we may credit its remains particularly those of a clois∣ter which are equal to any thing we have in that style of architecture This beautiful frag∣ment consists of eight windows with light but∣tresses between them and joins a ruined chapel on one side and on the other a hall or refec∣tory which still preserves its form sufficiently to give an idea of its just proportions To this is connected by ruined walls a massy tower What the ancient use of this fabric was whe∣ther it belonged to the ecclesiastical or civil part of the monastery is not now apparent but at present it gives a picturesque form to the ruin which appears to more advantage by the preeminence of some superior part  See page    At right angles with the chapel runs ano∣ther cloister a longer building but of coarser workmanship and almost covered with ivy The river which enters the valley at the dis∣tance of about half a mile from the ruin takes  a sweep towards it and passing under this clois∣ter opens into what was once the great court and makes its exit through an arch in the wall on the opposite side  This venerable pile  clad in the mossy vest of fleeting time  and decorated all over with variety of lychens streaming weatherstains and twisting shrubs is shaded by ancient oaks which hanging over it adorn its broken walls without encumbering them In short the valley the river the path and the ruins are all highly pleasing the  parts  are beautiful and the  whole  is harmonious  They who have lately seen Fordabbey will stare at this description of it And well may they stare for this description antedates its present state by at least a century If they had seen it in the year they might probably have seen it as it is here described Now alas it wears another face It has been in the hands of  improvement  Its simplicity is gone and miserable ravage has been made through every part The ruin is patched up into an awkward dwelling old parts and new are blended toge∣ther to the mutual disgrace of both The ele∣gant cloister is still left but it is completely  repaired whitewashed and converted into a greenhouse The hall too is modernized and every other part Sashwindows glare over pointed arches and Gothic walls are adorned with Indian paper  The grounds have undergone the same re∣formation The natural groves and lawns are destroyed vistas and regular slopes supply their room The winding path which con∣templation naturally marked out is gone suc∣ceeded by straight walks and terraces adorned with urns and statues while the river and its fringed banks have given way to canals and stewponds In a word a scene abounding with so many natural beauties was never per∣haps more wretchedly deformed  When a man exercises his crude ideas on a few vulgar acres it is of little consequence The injury is easily repaired and if not the loss is trifling But when he lets loose his de∣praved taste his absurd invention and his graceless hands on such a subject as this where art and nature united cannot restore the havoc he makes we consider such a deed under the same black character in matters of picturesque beauty as we do sacrilege and blasphemy in matters of religion The effects of superstition  we abhor Some little atonement however this implacable power might have made in taste for its mischiefs in religion if it had de∣terred our ancestors from connecting their mansions with ruins once dedicated to sacred uses We might then have enjoyed in per∣fection many noble scenes which are now either entirely effaced or miserably mangled  Before we leave these scenes I must relate a story of the monks of Ford which does great credit to their piety It happened in what century tradition says not that a gentleman of the name of Courtney a benefactor to the abbey was overtaken at sea by a violent storm and the seamen having toiled many hours in vain and being entirely spent abandoned themselves to despair  My good lads  said Courtney calling them together and pulling out his watch if watches were then in use  My good lads you see it is now four o'clock At five we shall certainly be relieved At that hour the monks of Ford rise to their de∣votions and in their prayers to St Francis will be sure to rembember me among their benefactors and you will have the benefit of being saved in my company Persevere only one hour and you may depend on  what I say  This speech reanimated the whole crew Some flew to the pump others to the leak all was life and spirit By this vigorous effort at five o'clock the ship was so near the shore that she easily reached it and St Francis got all the credit of the escape  SECT XXXI  FROM Fordabbey we were obliged to re∣turn to Axminster and from thence we set out for Bridport traversing vast cultivated hills from which on the left we had views into the country and on the right over the sea The isle of Portland ranged in the distance many leagues along the shore forming a long white beach which made an uncommon appearance  From Bridport to Dorchester we passed through a more inland country though in other respects similar to the country we had just left The features of it are broad and determined Sweeping hills with harsh edges intersect each other Here and there a bot∣tom is cultivated inclosed and adorned with a farmhouse and a few trees but in general the whole country is an extended down It is every where fed with little rough sheep which have formed it with constant grazing into the finest pasturage Indeed a chalky soil itself which is the substratum of these downs  is naturally inclined to produce a neat smooth surface The several flocks which pasture these wide domains have their respective walks and are generally found within the distance of a mile from each other We saw them once or twice issuing from their pens to take their morning's repast after a hungry night It was a pleasing sight to see such numbers of in∣nocent animals made happy and in the follow∣ing lines it is beautifully described  The fold  Poured out its sleecy tenants o'er the glebe  At first progressive as a stream they sought  The middle field but scattered by degrees  In various groups they whitened all the land  But the progressive motion here described is one of those incidents which is a better sub∣ject for poetry than painting For in the first place a  feeding flock  is seldom well  grouped  they commonly  separate  or as the poet well expresses it  they are scattered by degrees and whiten all the land  Nor are their attitudes varied as they all usually move the same way  progressive like a stream  Indeed the shape of a  feeding sheep  is not the most pleasing as its back and neck make a round heavy line which in contrast only has its effect To see a flock  of sheep in their most picturesque form we should see them reposing after their meal is over and if they are in sunshine they are still the more beautiful In  reposing  they are gene∣rally better grouped and their forms are more varied Some are commonly standing and others lying on the ground with their little ruminating heads in various forms And if the light be strong it spreads over the whole one general mass and is contrasted at the same time by a shadow equally strong which the flock throws upon the ground It may be ob∣served also that the fleece itself is well disposed to receive a beautiful effect of light It does not indeed like the smooth covering of hair allow the eye to trace the muscular form of the animal But it has a beauty of a different kind the flakiness of the wool catches the light and breaking it into many parts yet without destroying the mass gives it a peculiar rich∣ness  We saw another circumstance also in which sheep appear to advantage The weather was sultry the day calm and the roads dusty Along these roads we saw once or twice a flock of sheep driven which raised a consider∣able cloud As we were a little higher on the  downs and not annoyed by the dust the cir∣cumstance was amusing The beauty of the incident lay in the contrast between such sheep as were  seen perfectly  and such as were  in∣volved in obscurity  At the same time the dust became a kind of harmonizing medium which united the flock into one whole It had the same effect on a group of animals which a heavy mist when partial has on landscape But though circumstances of this kind are pleasing in nature we do not wish to see them imitated on canvas They have been tried by Loutherberg who with a laudable endeavour hath attempted many different  effects  but I think in this he has failed He has repre∣sented the dusty atmosphere of rapid wheels But it is an incident that cannot be imitated for as motion enters necessarily into the idea and as you cannot describe motion it is impos∣sible to give more than half the idea It is otherwise with vapour which from the  light mist  to the  sleeping fog  is of a more perma∣nent nature and therefore more adapted to the pencil  The only circumstance which can make a cloud of dust an object of imitation is  distance  as this gives it somewhat of a stationary ap∣pearance  One of the grandest ideas of this kind which I remember to have met with may be found in Zenophon's Anabasis  As Cyrus was approaching Artaxerxes over one of those vast plains which are often found in the east a horseman who had been making observations returned at full speed crying out to the troops as he rode through them that the enemy was at hand Cyrus not suspecting the king to be so near was riding carelessly in his chariot and the troops unarmed were marching negligently over the plain The prince leaping from his chariot presently armed himself mounted his horse called his generals around him and drew up his troops This was scarce done when the historian tells us  a white cloud was seen in the distant ho∣rizon spreading far and wide from the dust raised by so vast a host As the cloud ap∣proached the bottom of it appeared dark and solid As it still advanced it was observed from various parts to gleam and glitter in the sun and soon after the ranks of horse and foot and armed chariots were distinctly seen  As the translation is not  exactly  faithful the critical reader may be better pleased perhaps with the greater simplicity of the original    c  p vol i Edit Glasg    The extended plains of Dorsetshire however desolate they now appear have once been busy scenes The antiquarian finds rich employ∣ment among them for his curiosity To fol∣low him in quest of every heaving hilloc and to hear a discussion of conjectures about the traces of a Danish or a Roman mattoc where the eye of common observation perceives no traces at all might be tedious but he shews us several fragments of antiquity on these plains which are truly curious and convinces us that few places in England have been more considerable in Roman times than Dorchester Poundbury and Maidencastle as they are called are both extraordinary remains of Ro∣man stations the latter especially which en∣compasses a large space of ground Number∣less tumuli also are thrown up all over the downs These were antiquities in the times even of the Romans themselves  But the most valuable fragment on these plains is a Roman amphitheatre about half a mile from Dorchester It is constructed only of earth but it is of so firm a texture that it retains its complete form to this day Its mounds are of immense thickness and seem to be at least twenty feet high The area con∣tains  about an acre of land and is now a corn field There are two openings in the mound opposed to each other which have formerly been gates The circumference without ap∣pears circular to the eye though in fact I believe it is rather oval the inside is  apparently  so The difference of the figure seems to have been occasioned by the swelling of the mound within where the seats have been disposed This piece of antiquity is known by the name of  Maumbery  How much it resembles in form and size the old amphitheatres now sub∣sisting in Italy may be seen from the following description of one near Nice  I made a se∣cond excursion to these ancient ruins and measured the area of the amphitheatre with thread It is an oval figure the longest dia∣meter extending about a hundred and thir∣teen yards and the shortest about eighty In the centre of it was a square stone with an iron ring to which I suppose the wild beasts were tied to prevent their springing upon the spectators Some of the seats re∣main with two opposite entrances consisting each of one large gate and two smaller late∣ral doors arched there is also a consider∣able portion of the external wall but no  columns or other ornaments of architec∣ture  See Smollett's Letters    On comparing the amphitheatre of Dor∣chester with this at Nice we find the form of both exactly similar and no great difference in the size The area of Maumbery is two hundred and eighteen feet by a hundred and sixtythree Dr Stukely calculates that it might have contained about thirteen thousand people At Mrs Canning's execution who was burnt in the middle of this amphitheatre for the murder of her husband it is supposed to have contained in the area and on the mounds at least ten thousand spectators It is surprising that Camden takes not the least notice of this singular piece of antiquity  Dorchester as we may judge from these no∣ble remains was a place of great consideration in Roman times The works of Maidencastle supposed to be capable of receiving fifteen thousand men shew plainly the consequence of this station in a military light and I know not that the erection of an amphitheatre was thought necessary in any other part of Britain at least we have not that I recollect the re∣mains  of any other that is well ascertained except that at Sylchester  The situation of Dorchester is pleasant It stands on a high bank of the Frome and is surrounded with dry sheepdowns on which however the plough has lately made large en∣croachments The town is clean and well built and round it is a variety of pleasant walks which to a certain degree I think should always en∣gage the attention of the magistrate  In the neighbourhood of Dorchester are many gentlemen's seats well worth visiting The woody dips among these downy hills af∣ford naturally very fine situations The only one however which we regretted our not being able to see was Miltonabbey the seat of Lord Milton which lies about three miles from Dorchester The day which we had laid out for seeing it was rainy and we had not time to wait for a better The capital feature of the landscape we were told is a valley winding among hills of various forms and covered with woods which sometimes ad∣vance boldly on projecting knolls and some∣times  retire in bays and recesses We heard also the ruins of the abbeychurch commended as remains of the purest Gothic All these materials are in a high degree picturesque and if they are happily united Miltonabbey must be a very interesting scene To make a good picture composition however is as ne∣cessary as pleasing objects  SECT XXXII  BLANDFORD our next stage lies about sixteen miles from Dorchester and though not a place of such renowned antiquity is perhaps a still more agreeable town It lies within a curve of the river Stour and is plea∣santly seated among meadows and woods If a person wished to retire from business where he might have the conveniences and pleasures of the town and country united his choice might waver between Barnstaple Dorchester and Blandford If he wished to be near the sea he will find a pleasant seacoast at Barn∣staple If airy downs and open country pleased him he might fix at Dorchester But if he loved meadows and woodlands he must make choice of Blandford  This town has been twice burnt almost within the memory of man The last fire which was in the year destroyed it so completely that only twentysix houses re∣mained standing Here we cannot help be∣moaning the singular fate of these western  towns This is the fourth of them we met with Dorchester Crediton and Honiton were the other three which have been totally in a manner destroyed by fire To these might be added Wareham and very lately Mine∣head  Near Blandford stands Eastbury the seat of Lord Melcombe but it did not much attract our curiosity as it is more celebrated for the splendor of the house than the scenery around it  Brianston Mr Portman's seat which is near the town I suppose is a much more pleasing place We were not at his house but saw enough of his woody hill and the variety both of its steep and easy slopes together with the vale and winding river over which it hangs to regret the closing in of the evening upon us before we had finished our walk  From Blandford the country still continues wild and uncultivated yet full of antiquities among which the most celebrated is the found∣ation  of a sort called  Badburyring  It makes a considerable figure as we rode past and seems from its elevation its dimensions and complicated works for it has been fortified with a triple ditch to have been a place of un∣common strength  Some parts of these downs are very pictu∣resque They are finely spread and form ele∣gant sweeps with many pleasant views into a woody country which stretches away to the right They possess indeed all the variety taken notice of by the poet when he speaks of the  pure Dorsetian downs  In boundless prospect spread here shagged with woods  There rich with harvests and there white with flocks  In the last epithet he is rather unhappy for the sheep which graze these plains are so far from being  white  that they are universally washed all over with  redocre  which greatly injures both the pastoral and picturesque idea  Winborn was our next stage from Bland∣ford appearing as we approach it to stand in a wild vale surrounded with wood This town takes its name from one of the most ce∣lebrated  abbies of Saxon times Its form dates its antiquity The great church which is the only part remaining is of the heaviest and earliest species of Saxon architecture If it have no beauty however it hath at least the peculiarity of two contiguous and similar towers on one of which stood once a spire equal in height it is said to that of Salisbury  In this church rests a large collection of royal and noble bones but the tomb most vi∣sited is that of King Ethelred brother to Al∣fred the Great an excellent prince just shewn to his subjects In his early youth he engaged in all the toils and perplexities of government The times were adverse His country was over∣run by the Danes He encountered them in bat∣tle and was mortally wounded His remains were deposited in the chancel of this church where the inscription upon his gravestone one should suppose hath been occasionally re∣paired or it could never have endured the changes of so many hundred years His effi∣gies too in sculptured brass though of miserable workmanship is however better than we can suppose the times of Alfred could produce In a life so short there was little to record but the last great scene of it  S ETHELREDI REGIS WEST SAX∣ONUM MARTYRIS QUI ANNO DOMI∣NI DCCCLXXII XXIII APRILIS PER MANUS DANORUM PAGANORUM OC∣CUBUIT  The whole monument has a monkish air and was probably the production of later times than those of Alfred Mr Gough in his splen∣did publication on sepulchral antiquities sup∣poses from the form of the letters that this in∣scription is not older than the times of the Re∣formation which is perhaps bringing it as much too low as other people are inclined to carry it too high  From Winborn we passed through a heathy barren flat unpleasant country to Pool which lies about nine miles farther This country unpleasant as it is is rendered more so as we approach the town The whole coast is oozy and when the tide ebbs it has the ap∣pearance of a vast swamp with which the heathy flat before us unites in one level sur∣face Nothing under the idea of landscape can be more disagreeable When the tide flows the view is somewhat mended The  water covering the swamp gives some variety to the surface of a dead uninteresting flat  Beyond the water appear the high lands of  the isle  of Purbeck as it is called though it is in fact only a vast promontory running eight or nine miles in the form of a peninsula along the coast It is washed by the river Frome on one side and by the sea on the other Here are dug great quantities of that hard species of stone which takes the name of the country and is of such excellent use in paving Here too are found marbles more beautiful than the marbles of Italy but less valued because more common They are something like the marbles we admired at Ply∣mouth  See page  but I think more variegated The veins running on a brown ground are white red and blue  Seated high on one of the eminences of Purbeck far to the west we saw Corffcastle but the distance was too great to distinguish its features clearly The ruins of it are said to be the most considerable of the kind in Eng∣land It was reduced to this state by the par∣liament at the conclusion of the civil wars  Vast piles of ruin were thrown down into the ditch but the immense massiness of them and the tenacity of the mortar will long preserve them from any farther separation The prin∣cipal facts commemorated in this celebrated castle are the murder of Edward the Martyr by Elfrida the imprisonment of Edward the Second till he was carried to his last horrid confinement at Berklycastle and the long siege it underwent in the civil wars of Charles I defended by Lady Banks wife of Lord Chief Justice Banks to whom it belonged with a garrison only of forty men against an army with artillery  In the king's library in the British Museum  No D III  are a set of maps of the several counties of England which belonged to the old Lord Bur∣leigh and are rendered curious by several of his notes and memoranda written upon their margins To the island of Purbeck he seems to have paid great attention His notes upon it probably have a reference to the Spanish in∣vasion We are not to expect any picturesque remarks from Lord Burleigh but his observ∣ations give us  an idea of the coast  At Stud∣landbay  he observes that forty boats may land but not without danger At Swanage boats may land and retreat at any time of the tide In this bay and Studlandbay six or seven hundred ships of a thousand ton burden may ride safe in any wind Along this coast for three miles there is a good landing Shipman'spool is a creek where the enemy cannot land more than two or three boats Batteragebay is full of rocks and shelves Such also are Worbarrowbay Arestmiss and Lullworthcove But in Worbarrowbay and Shipman'spool five hundred sail of large ships may ride in al∣most every wind  Pool lies on a bay of the sea which is very intricate The body of it is a large and com∣modious harbour but it runs into many little creeks and winding channels which give it the air of a waterlabyrinth When the tide flows the town appears encircled with water and looks like Venice But the shores are so low especially about Brownisland which appears only like a bank that there is little picturesque scenery about the place In some parts when the tide is full and you can get a few trees into the view you have a tolerable Dutch  landscape In general however all is bare and that painter only who can skilfully fill his foreground with figures and marine append∣ages can make a picture of it But few paint∣ers have the art of touching small figures in landscape though many have the misfortune to spoil their pictures by attempting it The  general proportions  even of small figures and their graceful actions for there is a species of  picturesque grace  of which even  clowns  should participate are very hard to hit We judge of the difficulty from the few who have ex∣celled Scot who understood the form of a ship and in his seaviews could give his skies and water not indeed the brilliancy of Van∣derveld yet a clearness which every one could not attain was very deficient in the necessary addition of figures He could not place their heads on their shoulders nor hang on their arms nor set them on their legs nor give them an easy action And yet a few touches will do all thisit is surprising how fewwhen those touches are well understood Vander∣veld could do it Zeeman could do it and yet perhaps neither of these masters under∣stood the anatomy of the human body Nei∣ther of them perhaps could have drawn either  a leg or an arm with accuracy But in draw∣ing a small figure for a landscape accuracy is not required it is enough to understand its  ge∣neral proportion  the  symmetry of its parts  and the  effect of action  To understand the  effect of action  is so exceedingly necessary that nothing hurts the eye more than to see a figure awk∣wardly using its arms and legs Almost any eye can see the impropriety In the manage∣ment of small figures I mentioned Callot two of whose pictures we had seen at Longfordcastle among the most able masters  See page  They who have not an opportunity of seeing his pictures which are scarce may observe the same skill in his prints and yet I should not care to mention this master as a perfect model because with all his excellence there is often a degree of affectation in his attitudes If his figures had been large the eye would have taken quick disgust but in a miniature the ex∣aggeration of posture is less striking  Our route from Pool to Christchurch led us over a heath wilder almost than any we had  yet found but it scarcely lasted four miles It ended in agreeable lanes through a country not unpleasant At least the force of contrast with the country we had just seen gave it a pleasant appearance Here whenever we had an opening on the right we had views of the sea the Isle of Wight and the Needles  From Christchurch we proceeded to Ly∣mington skirting the borders of New Forest But as I have given an account of this coun∣try in another work  See Forest Scenery  I shall pass it over here  SECT XXXIII  AT Lymington we embarked for the Isle of Wight and stood for Cowes As we ap∣proached it the shore soon began to form into two points of land the nearer of which is de∣fended by a small castle the farther seemed high ground and woody  As we drew nearer the bay began to open and as we turned the castlepoint an ample road well secured lay before us full of large shipping The town of Cowes occupied the two sides of the hill on the right and left The harbour is a creek running a considerable way into the country It is formed by the river Medina which comes down from the higher grounds where the island swells into its greatest breadth and is navigable as far as Newport about six miles from the sea  At Cows we landed intending to spend two or three days in the island which we hoped would allow us sufficient time to exa∣mine its picturesque beauties  The form of the Isle of Wight is that of an irregular lozenge From the eastern point to the western it ranges about twentythree miles from the northern to the southern about thir∣teen Through the middle of it in the longer direction runs a track of high land in some parts rather mountainous but of the smooth downy kind fit for the pasturage of sheep From these high grounds we have every where a view of the island and its boundaries of the sea towards the south and towards the north of the coast of Hampshire from which the island is separated by a channel about five or six miles in breadth  The shores of the island on the northern side fall almost every where to the water in easy declivities except just at the western or Needle point where they are broken and pre∣cipitous But all the  back of the island  as the southern coast is commonly called which is washed by the tides of the ocean is worn bare to the naked rock and is in most places bounded against the sea by steep cliffs What depredation the waves in a course of years have made upon it is evident from the frag∣ments of rock which have tumbled from the undermined cliffs and lie scattered along the  shore Many of them are far out at sea and at low water only shew their heads above the waves No part of the British coast is more dangerous to vessels ungoverned and driving in the storm  From Cowes our road led us first to New∣port along the course of the Medina which afforded many happy situations to those who are fortunate enough to have any of its more pleasing reaches within the view of their houses A tide river has always its disadvan∣tages but it has its advantages also It is ge∣nerally once or twice a day adorned with the white sails of little skiffs passing to and fro and at all times with boats or anchoringbarks which have lost the tide and wait for its re∣turn These are picturesque circumstances which an inland river cannot have  Newport is the capital town in the island It grew into repute from its situation on the Medina after Carisbroke the natural capital was deserted It is a large handsome town and its market is often a curiosity As the island is so fertile that it is supposed to produce seven or eight times more grain than  its inhabitants consume the overplus is com∣monly brought to Newport to be shipped off and an hundred laden waggons may sometimes be seen ranged in double lines along the mar∣ketplace The freeschool also which is a handsome room about fifty feet long is worth looking into as it received greater honour than perhaps any schoolroom ever did before When the commissioners from the Parliament treated with King Charles I in the Isle of Wight this room was chosen for the confer∣ence  From Newport we proposed to take a view of the northern coast which extends from Cowespoint to St Helen's and is thought to contain the most beautiful part of the island This might be done in two ways either by riding along the coast and seeing each  par∣ticular  place that was pointed out as most beau∣tiful or by keeping along the higher grounds and taking a  general  view of the whole toge∣ther As we could not do both we chose the latter and soon found we had made the more judicious choice for the ground quickly nar∣rows in that part of the island and we ob∣tained  a good idea of its  general scenery  Mr Grose's house at the Priory and two or three other places we could have wished to have examined more particularly but as we should have been confined within hedges we could have seen little  besides the places we imme∣diately visited  Of the  general appearance  of the landscape on this side of the island some account shall be given at the conclusion of our circuit round it  Part of the high grounds over which we passed is called Ashydown On the loftiest summit of this ridge is placed a seamark When ships are driven by the storm so near the southern coast of the island as to lose sight of this mark of security little hope of safety remains It is hardly possible for them to avoid the rocks  As the high grounds began to decline we verged towards the southern part of the island with an intention to take a view of its rocky boundaries But we had not here the advan∣tageous point of view which we had on the other side The rocky shores which we wished to examine can be seen no where properly but from the sea We could only therefore get a view of them from some particular stands  which commanded a lengthened reach of the coast and such stands occurred but seldom  From the high grounds we descended first to Sandownbay which lies on the south coast and is the only part on this side where it is supposed an enemy could effect a landing It is defended by a fort which takes its name from the bay But the rocks soon commence and continue the guardians of the coast in an almost uninterrupted chain from this place to the very western point of the island  Among the curious parts of this rocky scenery we were carried to  Shanklinchine  a vast chasm winding between two high promon∣tories more than a mile into the country The chasm opens to the sea upon a bed of pebbles where generally a boat or two lie moored and the fisherman's hut stands half way up the pre∣cipice Both sides of the chasm are adorned with rock and both with wood and it is in general a picturesque scene but it has not the beauty of the dells of a mountainous country where the wood is commonly finer and the rocks more adorned and more majestic and where a stream pouring over ledges of rock  or falling down a cascade adds the melody of sound to the beauty of the scene  Near Shanklinchine Mr Stanley built a cottage among the rocks where he enjoyed the seabreezes in the heat of summer It is called  Undercliff  as it is built on a ledge of rock be∣tween the uppercliffs and the sea The view in front is not unpleasing It is a sort of wild rocky valley about half a quarter of a mile across hanging over the sea which ap∣pears abruptly beyond it without the interven∣tion of any middle ground It exhibits gene∣rally a moving picture presenting the track which ships coasting the island commonly take  As it is a  bird'seye  view many of these vessels especially of the smaller size appear with their masts and sails considerably  below the horizon  I mention this circumstance be∣cause in a picture such representations are ra∣ther unpleasing In representing a view of this kind therefore the painter if under a necessity to paint it should always wish to re∣move the vessels he introduces so far into dis∣tance as to raise their masts above the hori∣zon  See this subject treated more at large in the Forest Scenery vol ii p  The larger the vessel is the nearer of course she may approach the eye In the  va∣riety and motion of natural views  we are not so much hurt with these circumstances which have a bad effect in painting and yet a  bird'seye  view  on water  is always less pleasing than  on land  as the variety of ground is more amusing in itself than water and as it carries off the perspective better The  grandeur  which an  extensive view of the ocean  presents is a differ∣ent idea we are speaking here only of its  beauty  If we restrict the masts of ships how∣ever from appearing  below the horizon  we object not to boats and birds in that situation The boat either fishing or in motion the wheeling gull or the lengthened file of seafowl appear often to great advantage  against the bosom of the sea  and being marked with a few strong touches contribute to throw the ocean into perspective  But though the  situation  of  Undercliff  or  Steephill  is pleasing we could not say much for what is called the  cottage  It is covered indeed with thatch but that makes it no more a cot∣tage  than ruffles would make a clown a gen∣tleman or a meally hat would turn a laced beau into a miller We every where see the appen∣dages of junket and good living Who would expect to find a fountain bubbling up under the windows of a  cottage  into an elegant carved shell to cool wine The thing is beautiful but out of place The imagination does not like to be jolted in its sensations from one idea to another but to go on quietly in the same track either of  grandeur  or  simplicity  Easy contrasts it approves but violent interruptions it dislikes  Pleasing ideas no doubt may be executed under the form of a cottage but to make them  pleasing  they should be  harmonious  We some∣times see the  cottage idea  carried so far as to paste ballads on the walls with good effect But we need not restrict what may be called the  artificial cottage  to so very close an imi∣tation of the  natural one  In the  inside  cer∣tainly it may admit much greater neatness and convenience though even here every orna∣ment that approaches  splendor  should be re∣jected Without too though the roof be thatched we may allow it to cover two stories  and if it project somewhat over the walls the effect may be better We should not object to sashed windows but they must not be large and if you wish for a vestibule a common brick porch with a plain neat roof is all we allow We often see the front of a cottage covered with what is called  rough cast  which has a good effect and this may be tinted with a yellowish tinge mixed with lime which is more pleasing than the cold raw tint of lime and ashes But if in the front there is any stonework under the denomination of frize archetrave or ornament of any kind it is too much  The ground about a cottage should be neat but artless There is no occasion to plant cab∣bages in the front The garden may be re∣moved out of sight but the lawn that comes up to the door should be grazed rather than mown The sunkfence the net and the painted rail are ideas alien to the cottage The broad gravel walk too we totally reject and in its room wish only for a simple unaf∣fected one  These things being considered it may per∣haps be a more difficult thing to rear a cottage  with all its proper uniformities than is com∣monly imagined inasmuch as it may be easier to introduce the elegances of art than to catch the pure simplicity of nature  From Steephill we visited a scene of a very different kind Sir Richard Worsley's seat at Appuldercomb Here every thing was  uni∣formly grand  The house is magnificent and it is magnificently furnished Enriched ceilings a few good pictures costly hangings shewy carpets Gobelin chairs and large pierglasses all correspond and yet not in any expensive profusion  Since this has been written I am told the house is adorned with some curious pieces of Greek antiquities    The grounds too which were more the objects of our curiosity are laid out in a stile of greatness equal to the mansion A woody scene rising behind is a beautiful background to the house as well as an excellent shelter from the north In front is spread a magnifi∣cent lawn or rather a park for it is furnished with deer well varied and not illplanted stretching far and wide Its boundary in one  part is confined at the distance of about two miles by a hill running out like a promon∣tory whose continuous horizontal ridge might hurt the eye if it were not crowned with a castle This object seems well executed and is certainly well placed Views of the sea and various parts of the island are judiciously opened from all the higher grounds about the house  SECT XXXIV  FROM this scene of magnificence in splen∣dor we visited another of magnificence in ruin This was Carisbrokecastle an object perhaps the best worth seeing of any in the island Instead of passing on therefore to the Needlecliffs which remained yet unseen we returned to Newport which lies within a short walk of the castle  Carisbrokecastle stands on elevated ground nearly in the centre of the island It is a for∣tress of great antiquity Its towers and battle∣ments have been the care of several princes through a long series of years and we easily mark the style of different ages not only from the dates and arms which are placed in vari∣ous parts of the castle but also in the mode of building Its latest works have the air of mo∣dern fortification They are constructed of earth faced with stone and are carried round the castle as an outwork forming a circum∣ference of about a mile and a half What is properly called the castle stands on somewhat  less than two acres of land It is difficult on the spot to  comprehend  the various parts of this complicated fortress to  describe  it would be impossible Some of the more remarkable parts are commonly shewn We were carried to see Montjoy's tower the walls of which are eighteen feet thick We were conducted also to the top of the Keep from whence we discovered the sea in the three directions of north south and east On the west a hill in∣tercepted it We were shewn also a well as curious for its  depth  as the Keep is for its  height  and were desired to listen to the echoes and  lengthened sound  which even a pin makes when thrown into it There lived lately an appendage to this well which deserved notice also It was an ass which had drawn water patiently from it through the space of forty years  Carisbrokecastle was once the residence of the princes of the country and afterwards of appointed governors when the island became annexed to the crown As the inhabitants had not that ready access to justice which other parts of the kingdom had they sometimes smarted under the despotic power of their go∣vernors Remonstrances were often made to  the crown but it seems to have been a maxim of state especially during the reign of the Tudors to strengthen rather than abridge the power of governors in the remoter provinces and though it was not always a maxim of jus∣tice it was probably a maxim of good policy On the borders of Scotland we have many in∣stances of this delegated tyranny  But though the governors of the island were sometimes apt to overrule law themselves they were careful not to let the inhabitants feel vexations of any law but their own For this reason they would never suffer an at∣torney to settle in the island In the Oglander family are preserved some memoirs of the country written by Sir John Oglander one of their ancestors in which we are told that in the reign of Elizabeth when Sir George Cary was governor of the island an attorney came sneaking into it with a view to settle Sir George hearing of him had him apprehended and ordering bells to be fastened about his legs and a lighted firebrand tied to his back he turned him loose to the populace who hunted him out of the island  See Sir R Worsley's Account of the Isle of Wight    Adjoining to Carisbroke castle is a royal domain called Parkhurst or Carisbrokeforest It contains about three thousand acres and must have been when its woods were lux∣uriant very beautiful It is now a naked scene but we saw its elegant lines with more advan∣tage than if it had been adorned with all its sylvan drapery The deer its ancient inhabit∣ants are now nearly extinct and it is grazed by sheep and little groups of wild horses which are not less ornamental  The great historical circumstance of Caris∣brokecastle is its having been long the prison of distressed majesty Many a mournful tale on this subject the noble historian of those times hath told us He is circumstantial in his relation of the unhappy Charles's imprison∣ment here But in an account of the Isle of Wight collected by an ancestor of the Worsleyfamily and printed though in few hands some circumstances with regard to that event are mentioned which had not come to the ears of Lord Clarendon  That historian tells us through what means this unfortunate prince threw himself into the power of Colonel Hammond who was then governor of the Isle of Wight Ham∣mond  however seems to have been a man of humanity and while his hands were untied was disposed to shew the king every civility in his power Charles took his exercise on horse∣back where he pleased though his motions were probably observed and as the parliament had granted him five thousand pounds a year he lived a few months in something like royal state  But this liberty was soon abridged his chaplains and servants were first taken from him then his going abroad in the island gave offence and soon after his intercourse with any body but those set about him So soli∣tary were his hours during a great part of his confinement that as he was one day standing near the gate of the castle with Sir Philip Warwick he pointed to an old decrepid man walking across one of the courts and said that man is sent every morning to light my fire and is the best companion I have had for many months  All this severe usage Charles bore with pa∣tience and equanimity and endeavoured as much as possible to keep his mind employed He had ever been impressed with serious thoughts of religion which his misfortunes had  now strengthened and confirmed Devotion meditation and reading the scriptures were his great consolation The few books he had brought with him into the castle were chiefly on religious subjects or of a serious cast Among them was Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity This book it is probable he had studied with great attention as it related much to the na∣tional questions of that time in which no man was better versed In his slender catalogue we find also two books of amusement Tasso's Jerusalem and Spencer's Fairy Queen If Charles had  acted  with as much judgment as he  read  and had shewn as much  discernment in life  as he had  taste in the arts  he might have figured among the greatest princes Every lover of picturesque beauty however must re∣spect this amiable prince notwithstanding his political weaknesses We never had a prince in England whose genius and taste were more elevated and exact He saw the arts in a very enlarged point of view The amusements of his court were a model of elegance to all Eu∣rope and his cabinets were the receptacles only of what was exquisite in sculpture and painting None but men of the first merit in their profession found encouragement from  him and these abundantly Jones was his architect and Vandyck his painter Charles was a scholar a man of taste a gentleman and a christian he was every thing but a king The  art of reigning  was the  only art  of which he was ignorant  But though a love for the arts we see has no connection with  political wisdom  yet we cannot so easily give up its tendency to  melio∣rate the heart  This effect we may  presume at least  it had on Charles  To this supposition in favor of the arts it is objected that we often see among professional men very abandoned libertines But I should here wish to suggest a distinction between an  innate love for what is beautiful  and that sort of  mechanical turn  which can happily delineate colour and express an object of beauty The one is seated in the  heart  and the other in the  eye and in the fingers  The  mechanical man  merely following his profession is governed by no idea but that of enriching himself It is not the love of beauty with which he is smitten but the love of money He paints a picture with as little enthusiasm as a blacksmith shoes a horse All this is sordid Whereas the true admirer of art feels his mind thoroughly  impressed with the  love of beauty  He is trans∣ported with it in nature and he admires it in art the substitute of nature The love of beauty may exist without a hand to execute the images it excites It may exist the more strongly perhaps for being only  felt  for the conceptions of genius never rise in value from their being embodied The  embodied form  is always below the  original idea  The beauteous forms of nature and art thus impressed on the mind give it a disposition to happiness from the habit of being pleased from the habit of seeking always for pleasing objects and making even displeasing objects agreeable by throwing on them such colours of imagi∣nation as improve their defects and if a  love for beauty  is not immediately connected with  moral  ideas we may at least suppose that it softens the mind and puts it in a frame to receive them  An intimate acquaintance with the works of art and genius in their most beautiful and amiable forms says an agreeable writer harmonizes and sweetens the temper opens and extends the imagin∣ation and disposes to the most pleasing views of mankind and Providence By con∣sidering nature in this favourable point of  view the heart is dilated and filled with the most benevolent sentiments and then indeed the secret sympathy and connection between the feelings of natural and moral beauty the connection between a good taste and a good heart appears with the greatest lustre  Gregory's Compar View p    We left the unhappy Charles who occa∣sioned these remarks in one of the gloomy mansions of Carisbrokecastle amusing his so∣litary hours with Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity and Spencer's Fairy Queen His exercise was now much abridged He was skilled in horse∣manship and fond of riding But as this was refused he spent two or three hours every morning in walking on the ramparts of the castle Here he enjoyed at least a fine air and an extensive prospect though every object he saw the flocks straying carelessly on one side and the ships sailing freely on the other put him in mind of that liberty of which he was so cruelly deprived  In the mean time he was totally careless of his person He let his beard and his hair grow and was inattentive to his dress  They  who had seen him  says Lord Clarendon  a year before thought his countenance ex∣tremely altered his hair was grey and his appearance very different from what it had been  There is a picture of him at Sionhouse in which the distresses of his mind are strongly characterised on his countenance A person is represented delivering him a letter which may be supposed to contain bad news Charles's features were always composed and serious but here they are heightened with a melancholy air and yet they are marked also with mildness and fortitude It is a very affecting picture as it brings strongly before us the feelings of this amiable prince on the most disastrous events of his life It is painted so much in the manner of Vandyck that it might easily be mistaken for one of his best pictures But it was cer∣tainly painted by Sir Peter Lely who copied after Vandyck when he first came into Eng∣land Vandyck died in the year which was before the troubles of Charles began  During the time of his imprisonment in Carisbrokecastle three attempts were made chiefly by the gentlemen of the island to res∣cue him Lord Clarendon gives us the detail  of two of them but a third which he had heard of he supposes to have been a mere fiction As it is mentioned however in the Worsley papers with every mark of authen∣ticity and as one of the principal conductors of it was a gentleman of that family there seems to be little doubt of its being a fact The following is an abstract of it  By a correspondence privately settled with some gentlemen in the island it was agreed that the king should let himself down by a cord from a window in his apartment A swift horse with a guide were to wait for him at the bottom of the ramparts and a vessel in the offing was to be ready to convey him where he pleased The chief difficulty in the scheme was in the first step The associating gentlemen were doubtful how the king should get through the iron bars of his window But Charles assured them he had tried the passage and did not doubt but it was sufficiently large All things therefore were now prepared the hour was come and the secret sign thrown up to the king's window Charles being ready began the attempt but he soon found he had made a false calculation Having protruded his head and shoulders he could get no far∣ther  and what was worse having made great exertions thus far he could not draw himself back His friends at the bottom heard him groan in his distress but were unable to relieve him At length however by repeated efforts he got himself disengaged but made at that time no farther attempt Afterwards he con∣trived to saw the bars of his window asunder and another scheme was laid but the parti∣culars of this Lord Clarendon details  The treaty at Newport soon followed after which Charles was seized by the army and carried a prisoner to Hurstcastle In his way thither he met Mr Worsley one of the gentlemen who had risked his life for him at Carisbroke Charles wrung his hand with affection and pulling his watch out of his pocket gave it to him saying  That is all my gratitude has to give  This watch is still preserved in the family It is of silver large and clumsy in its form The case is neatly ornamented with filagree but the movements are of very ordinary work∣manship and wound up with catgut I men∣tion these particulars merely for the sake of observing that the arts do not certainly troop in companies together so much as they are  often represented At the time when this clumsy piece of mechanism was made which we may suppose was the work of the best artist of his day architecture and painting were at a height which they have never exceeded The case seems to be this when art has a model before it as painting has nature and archi∣tecture the Grecian orders it soon arrives at perfection But such arts as depend on inven∣tion science and mechanic skill work their way but slowly in a country  In the year on digging a grave in the church of New∣port a leaden coffin was found with this inscription ELISA∣BETH  d  DAUGHTER OF THE LATE KING CHARLES DECEASED SEP  th  MDCL    From Carisbrokecastle we proposed to visit the western parts of the island and took our course as before along the higher grounds through the middle of the country Our road led us near Swanston the seat of Sir Fitzwil∣liam Barrington which seems to be a pleasant scene and afterwards near Westoverlodge the habitation of Mr Holmes where we ob∣served nothing very interesting  A little stream which we cross here falling down to the northern coast forms at Newtown a few miles below one of the best natural har∣bours in the island The streets and vestiges of a considerable town are here traced but scarce a house is standing Whether it was planned and never built or whether it was de∣stroyed and never restored seems to be matter of uncertainty It is the general opinion that it was burnt in some Danish invasion But its being represented in parliament seems rather to indicate its having had a period of later existence  From hence we proceeded to Yarmouth where Henry VIII built a castle to defend the entrance through the Needles between the Isle of Wight and the coast of Hampshire on which coast stands Hurst another castle opposite to that at Yarmouth  Here the island draws nearly to a point The extreme part of it is almost separated from the main body by a creek which runs up from Yarmouth almost to the opposite shore The narrow isthmus is called Freshwatergate Here  we found ourselves among rocks and precipices of wonderful height and had from this stand a view of an extended range of chalky cliffs running along the southern coast of the island Here too we found a perforated cave which in some positions makes a picturesque fore∣ground while the sea appearing through it has a good effect  SECT XXXV  WE had now taken a view of the island from one end to the other and on the whole found ourselves rather disappointed in the chief object of our pursuit which was the picturesque beauty of its scenery  Picturesque beauty  is a phrase but little un∣derstood We precisely mean by it that kind of beauty which  would look well in a picture  Neither grounds laid out by art nor improved by agriculture are of this kind The Isle of Wight is in fact a large garden or rather a field which in every part has been disfigured by the spade the coulter and the harrow It abounds much more in tillage than in pastur∣age and of all species of cultivation cornlands are the most unpicturesque The regula∣rity of cornfields disgusts and the colour of corn especially near harvest is out of tune with every thing else  Yet these  manufactured scenes  are commonly thought to be  picturesque  You rarely meet a description of the beauties of the country in  which some of its  artificial appendages  do not make a part of the landscape And in  poetry  all these circumstances appear with advan∣tage  Sometimes walking not unseen  By hedgerow elms on hillocks green  While the plowman near at hand  Whistles o'er the furrowed land  And the milkmaid singing blithe  And the mower whets his scithe  But however pleasing all this may be in poetry on canvass hedgerow elms furrowed lands meadows adorned with milkmaids and hayfields adorned with mowers have a bad effect  In considering the Isle of Wight in a pic∣turesque light we divide it into three kinds of landscape the  high grounds  the  lower culti∣vated parts  and the  rocky scenes  The  high grounds  which as we just observed run from the eastern to the western point through the middle of the island are the only parts of the country which are in a state of na∣ture and yet even these are not wholly so for large farms have in many parts made in∣croachments upon them and cut them into squares by regular hedges and inclosed sheepwalks Sometimes however from these heights we are able to obtain a sweep of coun∣try  unincumbered with the intrusions of art About Carisbrokeforest particularly for many miles together we see nothing like cultivation  But still the best of these views afford little more than what may be called  extensive fore∣grounds  Of  distant country  we meet with no∣thing in a grand stile notwithstanding our ele∣vation In some parts we find little dips from the higher grounds into woody bottoms and in other parts distances of a few miles in extent over the country below but nothing that is remote enough to assume grandeur  A distance must stretch away many leagues from the eye it must consist of various  inter∣mediate parts  it must be enriched by  numerous objects  which lose by degrees all form and dis∣tinctness and finally perhaps  terminate  in faint purple mountains or perhaps mix with the blue mists of ether before it can pretend to the character of  grandeur  Such were the scenes presented to us from the heights of Pon∣tic and the hills of Quantoc  See pages and  But here we had nothing of this kind A scanty island could not afford them Sometimes indeed  when the foregrounds were happily disposed with the sea beyond them we got a grand and simple seaview  grander  perhaps than the dis∣tances I have just been alluding to as consist∣ing of  fewer parts  but for that reason less  beautiful  and  amusing  The northern coast between Cowes and St Helen's is generally considered as the most beautiful part of the island and it presents no doubt many lawns and woods and a variety of ground which must be ever pleasing but still we have only little pleasant pastoral scenes and these but seldom in any per∣fection for as the whole country is under the discipline of cultivation the picturesque eye is every where more or less offended  To this may be added that there is a great deficiency of wood Though here and there a few plantations about improved scenes make a contrast with the lawns they adorn the country in general is naked and yet even so late as in Charles II's time there were woods in the island so complete and extensive that it is said a squirrel might have travelled in several parts many leagues together on the tops of the trees These woods however are now almost universally cut down  But it is said the island does not depend so much on its  home scenery  Its views over the channel and the Hampshire coast are its pride These views however are far from being the most beautiful of their kind and much less beautiful than we had expected to find them They want the great ingredients of a pleasing  coast view  a  variety of line  and an  extent of distance  Either of these ingredients would be a foundation for beauty but here both are wanting  In the first place a  variety of line  is wanting The line of the opposite coast runs generally in a straight unbroken course for many leagues At least it appears to deviate so little from a straight line that the deviation is lost Where∣as the true beautiful  coast line  breaks away in various irregular curves forming either grand rocky projections or ample bays sweeping from the eye in winding perspective These ideas we had unhappily at this time strong in recollection having just left the shores of the Bristol channel in which they abound The comparison gave additional tameness to the lines of the Hampshire coast  But an  extent of country  might have made some amends for the want of  variety in the lines  We had however no more of this circum∣stance than of the other The whole length of the coast presents only a narrow edging of land Whenever you hear the beauties of it mentioned you always hear  places named  but never a  country described  You are never told for instance that the country forms some ample vale with wooded hills winding on each side or that the scene at first is woody beyond which the country retires into remote distance Nothing of this kind you hear for nothing of this kind exists Instead of this beautiful scenery you are informed you may see Ports∣mouth and Gosport and Lymington and a number of other places which lie near the shore And so you may with a good glass for it is the custom of the island always to con∣template landscape through a telescope  There are indeed times when views on this coast are grander than can be exhibited in any part of the world When the navy of England is forming a rendezvous at Spithead or waiting for a wind at St Helen's every curious per∣son who loves a grand sight would wish for a stand on the islandcoast And indeed the  eastern end of it is generally entertained with some exhibition of this kind even in time of peace for though a fleet of thirty or forty sail of the line is not continually riding near the coast yet generally either some ships of war or two or three frigates are passing or re∣pairing from Portsmouthharbour going out on a cruise or returning from one  These are sights with which the western coasts of the island are not often entertained The telescope there is seldom levelled at fleets or ships of the line Sometimes a solitary frigate with a fair wind or an Indiaman may lead through the Needles and attract the atten∣tion of the western islanders but on that side of the coast they must generally be content with views adorned with skiffs passageboats and fleets of whitingfishers If however they will be content to substitute the  picturesque  in the room of the  grand  they have in these minuter appendages the advantage of their eastern neighbours  Having thus considered the  higher  and  lower  grounds of the Isle of Wight we consider lastly its  rocky scenery  This is seldom an ornament to  the scenes of the island as it is seldom seen from any part of it Sometimes you may get a per∣spective view of a range of rockycoast but in general the rocks of the island make a shew only at sea  See page  and there they are  grand  rather than  picturesque  Their  height  gives them gran∣deur some of them rearing themselves six hundred feet above the level of the water Their  extent  also is magnificent as they range in some places perhaps a dozen miles along the coast But their  form  and  colour  unite in in∣juring their beauty  With regard to their  form  instead of pre∣senting those noble masses and broad sur∣faces of projecting rocks which we see along many of the coasts of England they are broken and crumbled into minute parts The chalky substance of which they are con∣structed has not consistence to spread into an ample surface It shivers too much If I were to describe these rocks therefore in two words I should call them  magnificently little  This however is a disadvantage only on the  foreground At sea  all these frittered parts dis∣solve away and are melted by distance into broad surfaces  But here again the  colour  offends These cliffs are not chalk yet are so like chalk that the fossilist hardly knows what else to call them The painter is in the same dilemma He finds them not white but so nearly white that he hardly knows what other colour to give them Nature has in many parts spread over them a few stains and tints as she seems always studious to remove an offensive glare But on so large a surface this has but a partial effect and the whole coast for many leagues together appears nearly white Now of all hues the painter dislikes white the most as it is the most refractory and unaccommodating to his other tints Of course therefore the cliffs of the Isle of Wight offend him  From this uniformity of colour the rocks of Allumbay should be excepted the strata of which are tinted and marbled with red brown blue and other colours in a beautiful manner This bay is nearly opposite to Hurstcastle and is the most western inlet which is formed on the northern side of the island  There is one circumstance belonging to the western rocks of the Isle of Wight which  though but a trifling one is of a picturesque nature and ought therefore to be mentioned At periodical seasons they are frequented with prodigious flights of seafowl of various kinds Their numbers can only be described by the hyperbolical expression of  darkening the air  They sit commonly when they are not in mo∣tion on the ledges of the cliffs in the cran∣nies of which they breed You see them ranged in black files through a considerable space The report of a gun brings them all out of their recesses and the air which a moment before was still and quiet is now beaten with myriads of busy wings and filled with screams and cries as various as the several tribes from which they issue  We have often rested on our oars under the rocks  says Mr Pennant with much descriptive elegance  attentive to the sounds above our heads which mixed with the solemn roar of the waves swelling into the vast caverns beneath and retiring from them produced a fine effect The sharp note of the seagull the loud scream of the awk together with the hoarse deep peri∣odical croak of the cormorant which serves as a base to the rest often furnished us with  a concert and joined with the wild scenery that surrounded us afforded us a high degree of pleasure  But it is not I think from  novelty  to which Mr Pennant ascribes it that the pleasure arises These notes though dis∣cordant in themselves are in perfect harmony with the wild scenes where they are heard and this makes them chiefly interesting In the views therefore of this rocky coast these flights of birds should never be forgotten as they may well be numbered among its pictu∣resque appendages  Neither fish nor fowl can haunt a coast but the inhabitants find some means of turning them to advantage These airy inmates of such cliffs and precipices as hang beetling many fa∣thoms above the sea one should imagine might pass their lives in full security But man with the hand of art contrives to reach them He fixes an iron crow firm in the ground and tying a rope tight to it he lets himself down with a basket in his hand among the middle regions of the cliffs where the fowls inhabit So bold and sudden an invasion frights them immediately from their recesses With a watch∣ful eye he examines the parts of the rock  from which they chiefly escape and scram∣bling about by the help of his rope he fills his basket with their eggs for which he can al∣ways find a ready market  These birds also furnish  amusement  to all the neighbouring country In summer a number of shooting parties are formed both by land and sea and when the weather is fine you can seldom sail past without falling in with some of them  That man has a right to destroy such ani∣mals as are  noxious  to him is undoubted That he has a right also over the lives of such ani∣mals as are  useful  to him for food and other necessaries is equally unquestioned But whe∣ther he has a right to destroy life for his  amuse∣ment  is another question If he is determined to  act the tyrant  that is to consider  power  as conferring  right  the point is decided Power he certainly has But if he wish to act on authorized and equitable principles let him just point out the passage in his charter of rights over the brute creation which gives him the liberty of destroying life for his  amuse∣ment  On Noah and in him on all mankind  The charter was conferred by which we hold  The flesh of animals in fee and claim  O'er all we feed on power of life and death  But read the instrument and mark it well  The oppression of a tyrannous control  Can find no warrant there  I would not enter on my list of friends  Though graced with polished manners and fine sense  Yet wanting sensibility the man  Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm  The sum is this If man's convenience health  Or safety interfere his rights and claims  Are paramount and must extinguish theirs  Else they are allthe meanest things that are  As free to live and to enjoy that life  As God was free to form them at the first  Who in his sovereign wisdom made them all    I shall conclude these remarks on the nume∣rous flights of seafowl with a passage from Vaillent's Travels in Africa which is the most curious of the kind I have met with On his landing on Dassen island at the mouth of Saldanhabay near the cape of Good Hope he tells us  there rose suddenly from the whole surface of the island an immense ca∣nopy or rather a sky composed of birds of every species and of all colours cormorants seagulls seaswallows pelicans c I believe all the winged tribe of Africa were here assem∣bled All their voices united together formed such horrid music that I was every moment obliged to cover my head to give a little  relief to my ears The alarm which we spread was the more general among these legions of birds as we principally disturbed the females who were then sitting They had nests eggs and young to defend They were like furious harpies let loose against us They often flew so near us that they flap∣ped their wings in our faces and though we fired repeatedly we could not frighten them It seemed almost impossible to dis∣perse the cloud We could not move a step without crushing either eggs or young ones The earth was entirely strewed with them  There is besides these flights of birds ano∣ther picturesque circumstance frequently seen on the coasts of the Isle of Wight which may be mentioned though it is a dreadful one that of shipwrecks As the distresses of man∣kind furnish the choicest subjects for dramatic scenes so do they often for painting And among these no marine subject is equal to a shipwreck in the hands of a master I put it into the hands of a master because I have more frequently seen this subject mismanaged than any other A winter seldom passes in which  the inhabitants of these dangerous coasts are not called together to see some dreadful event of this kind Long experience has taught them to judge when the mischief is inevitable They see that every wave which beats over the perishing vessel drives her nearer some reefs of rocks well known to them though the seaman knows it not Signals can be of no use yet they make what signals they can to point out the danger In a short moment the dreadful crash arrives The labouring vessel now beating among the rocks gives way in every part and the hospitable islanders very unlike their neighbours on the Cornish coast have nothing left but to do every thing in their power to save the miserable people and recover what they can from the wreck  Having now finished our view of the Isle of Wight we returned from the rocks of Freshwater to Yarmouth where we took boat for Lymington  SECT XXXVI  IT has long been a question among natu∣ralists whether the Isle of Wight was ever joined to the coast of Hampshire Its western point has greatly the appearance of having been torn and convulsed Those vast insulated rocks called the  Needles  seem plainly to have been washed away from the shores of the island One of them which was known by the name of  Lot's Wife  a tall spiral rock was undermined and swallowed up by the sea not many years ago and there is every proba∣bility that the rest will follow  What renders this separation of the island from the main still more probable is that the sea makes yearly depredations along that part of the Hampshire coast called  Hordlecliff  which is just opposite to the Needles It has been observed too that there are chalkrocks at the bottom of the water exactly like the Needles all along the channel towards Christchurch  The best  recorded authority  which we have of this early union between the Isle of Wight  and the main is given us by Diodorus Sicu∣lus This writer speaking of the tin trade in Britain informs us that the people of Corn∣wall brought this metal to a certain island called  Ictis  for the sake of its being more easily transported from thence to the Conti∣nent into which island they carried it in carts when the tide ebbed for  Ictis  he says was only an island at full sea  Lib iv p ed Hen    By  Ictis  it is supposed Diodorus meant the Isle of Wight the ancient name of which was  Vectis  a name nearly similar This opinion however has been opposed by some and par∣ticularly by Mr Borlase in his Antiquities of Cornwall who rather supposes the  Ictis  of Dio∣dorus to be some island though he does not well settle where upon the coast of Cornwall But Mr Whitaker in his History of Man∣chester has brought forward the old opinion again with new authority  If then this supposition is at length well grounded we may gather from it these points of information that the Isle of Wight was once a vast promontory running out into the sea like the Isle of Purbeck at this time that  it was then united solidly to the coast of Hampshire at its western point and in all other parts surrounded by the sea but that about two thousand years ago which is somewhat before the time of Diodorus the sea had gained so far upon it that it became insular and peninsular according to the flux and reflux of the tide till at length the sea gaining still far∣ther possession formed it as it is at present into an absolute island  As we entered Lymingtonriver we found a fresh proof of the probability of the ancient union between Vectis and the main The tide was gone and had left vast stretches of ooze along the deserted shores Here we saw lying on the right a huge stump of a tree which our boatman informed us had been dragged out of the water He assured us also that roots of oaks and other trees were often found on these banks of mud which seems still to strengthen the opinion that all this part of the coast now covered with the tide had once been forestland  SECT XXXVII  FROM Lymington we proceeded to South∣ampton but all this part of the country through NewForest as far as to the bay of Southampton hath been examined in another work  Forest Scenery    At Redbridge we crossed the river which flows into Southamptonbay over a long wooden bridge and causeway sometimes co∣vered by the tide Ships of considerable bur∣den come up as far as this bridge where they take in timber from NewForest and other commodities  A little beyond Redbridge at a place called Milbroke a beautiful view opens of South∣ampton Before us lay Southamptonbay spreading into a noble surface of water The town runs out like a peninsula on the left and with its old walls and towers makes a pictu∣resque appearance On the right forming the other side of the bay appear the skirts of NewForest  and the opening in front is filled with a distant view of the Isle of Wight  Southampton is an elegant wellbuilt town It stands on the confluence of two large wa∣ters and when the tide is full is seated on a peninsula It is a town of great antiquity and still preserves its respectable appendages of ancient walls and gates The country around is beautiful  At Southampton we took boat to see the ruins of NetleyAbbey which lie about three miles below on the bay As we approached nothing could be seen from the water the bank is high and woody and skreens every thing beyond it Having landed and walked up the meadows about a quarter of a mile we entered a circular valley which seems to be a mile in circumference and is skreened with wood on every side  I believe much of this wood is now cut down  except that which opens to a part of the river and which has probably once been wooded also In a dip near the centre of this valley stands Netleyabbey As you approach it you see buildings only of the most ordinary species gableends and square  walls without any ornament except a few heavy buttresses  You enter a large square which was for∣merly known by the name of the Fountaincourt The side on which you enter seems to have been once chambered and divided into various offices Such also was the left side of the court where the bakery and ovens may still be traced But in general whatever the rooms have been which occupied these two sides the traces of them are very obscure On the third side opposite to the entrance the court is bounded by the south wall of the great church and along the fourth side range dif∣ferent apartments which are the most perfect of any that remain in this whole mass of ruin  The first you enter seems to have been a dininghall It is twentyfive paces long and nine broad and has been vaulted and cham∣bered above Adjoining to it on the right are the pantry and kitchen You still see in the former the aperture or butteryhatch through which victuals were conveyed into the hall The kitchen of NetleyAbbey is inferior to that of Glastonbury but is a spacious and lofty vaulted room and what is peculiar from one side of it leads a subterraneous passage to the river which some imagine to have been a com∣mon  sewer but it is too ample I should sup∣pose to have been intended for that purpose  At the other end of the dininghall you pass through a small vaulted room into the chapterhouse which is ten paces square This room is beautifully proportioned and adorned on each side by three arches which uniting at the top in ribs support a vaulted roof To this adjoin two smaller rooms from whence there is an entrance to the great church by the cross aisle  The great church has been a very elegant piece of Gothic architecture and is almost the only part of the whole ruin which is pic∣turesque All traces of the aisles and pillars are lost but the walls are entire except half the crossaisle which is gone The east and west windows remain the former has not yet lost all its ornaments and both are very beau∣tiful without as well as within Maundrel tells us that the east windows in all the Christian churches he met with in his travels as far as Tyre which were not fewer than a hundred were left uninjured  Maundrel's Travels p  A similar remark I think may be made on most of the ruined churches in England The fact is singular  but whether it is owing to chance or super∣stition may be doubted In that part of the crossaisle at NetleyAbbey which remains a small part of the stone roof is still left and is a very curious specimen of Gothic antiquity  More of this roof might still have remained if the warnings of Heaven as that renowned antiquarian Brown Willis informs us had taken effect From him we have an anecdote which  he assures us  is founded on fact of a carpenter who once trafficked with the owner of Netley for this elegant roof which he meant to pull down and convert into gain As he retired to rest his slumbers were dis∣turbed with dreadful dreams These having no effect the next night visions appeared venerable old men in Monkish habits with frowning faces and threatening hands Still he pursued his wicked purpose But the next night he had scarce fallen asleep when a mon∣strous copingstone fell plumb upon his head He started with horror and was hardly at length persuaded it was a dream All this having only a momentary effect in the morn∣ing he went to work on the execution of his design No farther warning was given him He had scarce mounted a ladder when a cop∣ingstone fell in earnest from the roof and put  him to instant death Others however it seems have been found notwithstanding this example who have pursued the design for a mere fragment of the roof only now remains  The present possessor pursues an opposite extreme The whole body of the church is now so choaked with ruin and overgrown with thickets and ivybushes that the greatest part of the building is invisible A degree of all these no doubt would be ornamental but like other ornaments when they are too pro∣fusely scattered they offend These ruins are as much obstructed on the outside as they are within We walked round them and could find only two places the two end windows where we could possibly take a view Every other approach is excluded except on the side we entered which least deserves to be exposed This part is so very ordinary that it raises a prejudice at first against the whole and the ruin would be shewn to much more advantage if this side were blocked up with wood and the approach made either by the east or west window of the great church Beyond the ruins are the remains of large stewponds which were formerly appendages of the abbey  SECT XXXVIII  AS we set sail from NetleyAbbey we had a beautiful view of Southampton running from us in a point directly opposite to that view which we had from Redbridge The indentations made by the river Itchin and other creeks are great advantages to the view  From Southampton we took our rout to Winchester through a very beautiful country The first object is an artificial avenue com∣posed of detached groups of fir The idea of an avenue as a connecting thread between a town and a country is a good one We observe however that the beauty of this avenue is much greater as we approach Southampton than as we leave it As we leave it the ave∣nue ends abruptly in a naked country but as we turned round and viewed it in retrospect it united with the woody scene around it which had a good effect A retrospect also  afforded beautiful views over Southampton river and its appendages the town Newforest and the Isle of Wight All this pleas∣ing country appeared under various forms and was often set off with good foregrounds  Having passed the avenue and a few miles of miscellaneous country no way interesting we entered about the sixth stone a forestscene abounding with all the charms of that species of landscape In this we continued three or four miles  From these woody scenes the country be∣comes more heathy but is still diversified with wood and affords many pleasing distances on the right till at length it suddenly dege∣nerates into chalky grounds which are of the same kind as those described in our approach to Winchester  See page    We left Winchester by the Basingstoke road which passes through a country with little pic∣turesque beauty on either hand It becomes by degrees flat and unpleasant and soon dege∣nerates into commonfield land which with its  striped divisions is of all kinds of country generally the most unpleasant  Near Basingstoke stand the ruins of Basinghouse which we cannot pass without feeling a respect for the gallant figure it made beyond that of any fortress of its size in the civil wars of Charles I It was at that time the seat of the Marquis of Winchester who fortified and held it for the king during the greatest part of those troublesome times though it underwent an almost continued blockade Once it was so far reduced by famine as to be on the point of surrendering and its relief by Colonel Gage was considered as one of the most sol∣dierly actions of the war Lord Clarendon has detailed this gallant enterprize at length The outlines of it are these The King was then at Oxford He had been applied to for assistance by the garrison at Basinghouse but it was blockaded by so large a force that all the mili∣tary men about him thought any attempt to relieve it desperate Gage however offered his service and getting together a few volun∣teers well mounted undertook the business On Monday night he left Oxford which is forty miles from Basinghouse came up with the besiegers before daylight on Wednesday  morning forced their lines by an unexpected attack and entered the place with a string of horses laden with provision The enemy soon found how contemptible a number had alarmed them and returning to their posts began to close up the avenues Gage with that readi∣ness of invention which is able to command the crisis of a great action sent orders into the country to provide quantities of provision for a large reinforcement which he hourly ex∣pected This intelligence gave a momentary pause to the motions of the enemy A mo∣ment was all that Gage wanted He issued in∣stantly from the garrison with his small troop of horse and through bye roads got safe to Oxford without interruption Thus relieved Basinghouse continued to baffle all the at∣tempts of the Parliament till the fatal battle of Naseby After that event misfortunes came in with a full tide upon the king Every day brought him some new account of the loss of his garrisons and among other places he had the mortification to hear of the loss of Basinghouse Cromwell himself appeared before it and summoning it in haughty language was answered with scorn The incensed chief fell upon it with a body of his veteran troops car∣ried  it by assault and put the garrison to the swordAmong the few fugitives that escaped was the celebrated engraver Hollar who had been shut up in the castle This event in a picturesque work is a circumstance worth mentioning  From Basingstoke we continued our route to Bagshot Lord Albermarle's house and im∣provements appeared to great advantage con∣trasted by the heath which surrounded them They seemed like an island in the main As we approached Stains the Duke of Cumber∣land's plantations in Windsorpark made a no∣ble appearance  From Stains we crossed the Thames at King∣ston where we entered Surrey  APPENDIX  SINCE this volume went to press Sir Joshua Reynolds's Lectures fell into the author's hands which he had never seen before As they point out two or three mistakes which he had made he thinks it proper to mention them in an Appendix In page speaking of monu∣ments in churches he expresses his doubts whether the  introduction of them will be any advantage to St Paul's which the judicious architect he supposes had already adorned as much as he thought consistent with the sublimity of his idea  In speaking on the same subject Sir Joshua on the contrary in∣forms us that  Sir Christopher Wren left niches in St Paul's on purpose for monuments busts single figures basreliefs and groups of figures  Vol ii p  The author can only say that he does not remember any niches or recesses in St Paul's which gave him ideas of this kind but as what Sir Joshua says is given as  information  and his remark depends only on  supposition  and  recollection  it must of course give way  In page he speak highly of Vandyck's superiority as a  portrait painter  but slightly of  his abilities  in history  A large piece in which Vandyck has many figures to manage he sup∣poses to be a work which required more skill in composition than Vandyck possessed His opi∣nion is formed chiefly on the great familypic∣ture at Wilton which gave occasion to these re∣marks and on two large pictures which he had formerly seen and examined at Houghtonhall in none of which the composition  pleased him  But Sir Joshua Reynolds in his Travels through Flanders tells us that he saw at Mecklin a pic∣ture of the Crucifixion by Vandyck which he thought one of the first pictures in the world and scruples not to say he thinks Vandyck had a genius for historypainting The author can∣not withstand such authority but must withdraw his own opinionor at least keep it modestly to himself  But though he had the mortification to find he differed from Sir Joshua Reynolds in these and a few more particulars he had the pleasure to find they agreed in a number of others Two or three of them belong to the volume before us In page the author observes that he had oftener than once judged falsely on the  first sight  of Salvator's pictures which pleased him more on a second view This however he considers as a fault for we expect from a good  picture as from a good man a favourable im∣pression at sight Sir Joshua's opinion of a good picture is the same He says  it should please at first sight and appear to incite the spectator's attention  Vol i p  In the st page the beautiful effect of easy action in a statue in opposition to none at all is considered and the Venus the Apollo the listening Slave and the Farnesian Hercules resting from one of his labours are instanced All these gentle modes of  action  or  expression  are considered in the passage alluded to as much more beautiful than the uninteresting vacancy of a consul standing erect in his robesHe had the pleasure to see remarks exactly similar to these in one of Sir Joshua's Lectures vol i p  Those works of the ancients  says he  which are in the highest esteem have some∣thing beside mere simplicity to recommend them The Apollo the Venus the Lao∣coon the Gladiator have a certain compo∣sition of action with contrasts sufficient to give grace and energy in a high degree But it must be confessed of the many thousand statues which we have their general charac∣teristic is bordering at least on inanimate in∣sipidity  THE END  A CATALOGUE of Mr GILPIN'S WORKS sold by Messrs CADELL and DAVIES in the Strand  An EXPOSITION of the NEW TESTAMENT intended as an Introduction to
