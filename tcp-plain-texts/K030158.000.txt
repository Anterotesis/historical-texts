 A COMEDY  ACT I  SCENE I  An Antichamber at Sir  GEORGE SPLENDORVILLE  's adjoining a Ball room  Enter  BLUNTLY  meeting a Servant in Livery  Bluntly  COME come is not every thing ready Is not the ballroom prepared yet It is past ten o'Clock  Servant  We have only to fix up the new chandedelier  Bluntly  I'll have no new chandelier  Servant  My master said the last ball he gave the company were in the dark  Bluntly  And if you blind them with too much light they will be in the dark still  Servant  The musicians sir wish for some wine  Blunty  What before the ball begins No tell them if they are tipsy at the end of if it will be quite soon enough  Servant  You are always so cross Mr Blunty when my master is going to have company  Bluntly  Have not I a right to be cross For while the whole house is in good humour if there was not one person cross enough to take a little care every thing would be wasted and ruined through extreme good temper  A man crosses the stage  Here you MisterPray are you the person who was sent with the chandelier  Shopman  Yes sir  Bluntly  Then please to take it back againWe don't want it  Shopman  What is your objection to it sir  Bluntly  It will cost too much  Shopman  Mr Bluntly all the trades people are more frightened at you than at your masterSir George Heaven bless him never cares how much a thing costs  Bluntly  That is because he never cares whether he pays for it or notbut if he did depend upon it he would be very particular Tradesmen all wish to be paid for their ware don't they  Shopman  Certainly sir  Bluntly  Then why will they force so many unnecessary things and make so many extravagant charges as to put all power of payment out of the question  Enter  EVANS  The Tradesman goes off at the opposite Door  Bluntly  How do you do Mrs Evans  Suddenly  Evans  What makes you sigh Mr Bluntly  Bluntly  What makes you smile  Evans  To see all the grand preparations for the ball this evening I anticipate the joy my lady will take here and I smile for  her  Bluntly  And I sigh for my masterI foresee all the bills that will be brought in for this evening's expence and I anticipate the sorrow it will one day be to  him  Evans  But consider Mr Bluntly your master has my lady's fortune to take  Bluntly  Yes but I consider he has your lady to take along with it and I prophecy one will sick by him some time after the other is gone  Evans  For shameMy lady I have no doubt will soon cure Sir George of his extravagance  Bluntly  It will then be by taking away the means Why Lady Caroline is as extravagant as himself  Evans  You are mistakenShe never gives routs masquerades balls or entertainments of any kind  Bluntly  But she constantly goes to them whenever she is invited  Evans  That I call but a slight imprudenceShe has no wasteful indiscretions like Sir George For instance she never makes a lavish present  Bluntly  No but she  takes  a lavish present as readily as if she did  Evans  And surely you cannot call that imprudence  Bluntly  No I call it something worse  Evans  Then although she loves gaming to distraction and plays deep yet she never loses  Bluntly  No but she always winsand  that  I call something worse  A loud rapping at the street door  Evans  Here's the company Will you permit me Mr Bluntly to stand in one corner and have a peep at them  Bluntly  If you please  Rapping again  What spirit there is in that Rat tat tat tatAnd what life frolic and joy the whole house is going to experience except myself As for me I am ready to cry at the thoughts of it all  Exit  Enter  LADY CAROLINE  L Caroline  Here the first of the company I am sorry for it  EVANS  comes forward  Evans what has brought you hither  Evans  I came my lady to see the preparations making on  your  accountfor it is upon your account alone that Sir George gives this grand  fÃª  e  L Caroline  Why I do flatter myself it isBut where is he What is it o'clockIt was impossible to stay at the stupid operaHow do I look I once did intend to wear those set of diamonds Sir George presented me with the other morningbut then I reflected again that if  Evans  Ah my lady what a charming thing to have such a loverSir George prevents every wish he must make the best of husbands  L Caroline  And yet my father wishes to break off the marriagehe talks of his prodigalityand certainly Sir George lives above his income  Evans  But then Madam so does every body else  L Caroline  But Sir George ought undoubtedly to change his conduct and not be thus continually giving balls and entertainmentsand inviting to his table acquaintance that not only come to devour his dinners and suppers but him  Evans  And there are people malicious enough to call your ladyship one of his devourers too  L Caroline  As a treaty of marriage is so nearly concluded between us I think Mrs Evans I am at liberty to visit Sir George or to receive his presents without having my character or my delicacy called in question  A loud rapping  The company are coming is it not strange he is not here to receive them  Exit  EVANS  Enter two Ladies and a Gentleman who curtsy and bow to  LADY CAROLINESIR GEORGE  enters at the opposite door magnificently dressed  Sir George  Ladies I entreat your pardon dear Lady Caroline excuse me I have been in the country all the morning and have had scarce time to return to town and dress for your reception  Another rapping  Enter  MR LUCRE LORD HAZARD LADY BRIDGET SQANDER c  Sir George  Dear Lucre I am glad to see you  Mr Lucre  My dear Sir George I had above ten engagements this evening but they all gave place to your invitation  Sir George  Thank youMy dear Lady Bridget  L Bridget  It is impossible to resist an invitation from the most polished man alive  Sir  GEORGE  bows  What a superb dress  in his hearing as he turns away  and what an elegant deportment  Mr Lucre  After speaking apart with  SIR GEORGE  No I am not in a state to take any part at PharoI am ruin'dWould you believe it Sir George I am not worth a farthing in the world  Sir George  Yes I believed it long ago  Mr Lucre  Now we are on that subjectcould you lend me a hundred pounds  Sir George  Taking out his pocketbook  I have about me only this bill for two hundred  Mr Lucre  That will do as wellI am not circumstantial  Takes it  And my dear Sir George command my purse at any timeall it contains will ever be at your service  Sir George  I thank you  Mr Lucre  Nay though I have no money of my own yet you know I can always raise friendsand by heaven my dear Sir George I often wish to see you reduced to my circumstances merely to prove how much I could and  would  do to serve you  Sir George  I sincerely thank you  Mr Lucre  And one can better ask a favour for one's friend than for one'sself you know for when one wants to borrow money on one's own account there are so many little delicacies to get the better ofsuch as I felt just nowI was as pale as death I dare say when I asked you for this moneydid not you perceive I was  Sir George  I can't say I did  Mr Lucre  But you must have observed I hesitated and looked very foolish  Sir George  I thought for my part that I looked as foolishBut I hope I did not hesitate  Mr Lucre  Nor ever will when a friend applys to you I'll answer for itNor ever shall a friend hesitate when you apply  Lord Hazard  Taking  SIR GEORGE  aside  The obligations I am under to you for extricating me from that dangerous business  Sir George  Never name it  Lord Hazard  Not only name it Sir George but shortly I hope to return the kindness and if I do but live  Sir George  To the company  Permit me to conduct you to the next apartment  Lady Caroline  Most willingly Sir George I was the first who arrived which proves my eagerness to dance  Sir George  Aside to her  But let me hope passion for dancing was not the only one that caused your impatience  As the company move towards the ballroom  Mr LUCRE  and  LORD HAZARD  come forward  Mr Lucre  Oh there never was such a man in the world as the master of this house there never was such a friendly generous noble heart he has the best heart in the world and the best taste in dress  The company exeunt and the music is heard to begin  SCENE II  An Apartment which denotes the Poverty of the Inhabitants  HENRY  and  ELEANOR  discovered  Eleanor  It is very late and very cold too brother and yet we have neither of us heart to bid each other good night  Henry  Nobeds were made for rest  Eleanor  And that noise of carriages and linkboys at Sir George Splendorville's next door would keep us awake if our sorrows did not  Henry  The poor have still more to complain of when chance throws them thus near the richit forces upon their minds a comparison might drive them to despair if  Eleanor  If they should not have good sense enough to reflect that all this bustle and show of pleasure may fall very short of happiness as all the distress  we  feel has not yet thank Heaven reached to misery  Henry  What do you call it then  Eleanor  A trial sent to make us patient  Henry  It may make you so but cannot me Good morning to you  Going  Eleanor  Nay it is night yet Where are you going  Henry  I don't knowTo take a walkThe streets are not more uncomfortable than this place and scarcely colder  Eleanor  Oh my dear brother I cannot express half the uneasiness I feel when you part from me though but for the shortest space  Henry  Why  Eleanor  Because I know your temper you are impatient under adversity you rashly think providence is unkind and you would snatch those favours which are only valuable when bestowed  Henry  What do you mean  Eleanor  Nay do not be angry but every time you go out into this tempting town where superfluous riches continually meet the eye of the poor I tremble lest you should forfeit your honesty for that which Heaven decreed should not belong to you  Henry  And if I did you would despise and desert me  Eleanor  No not desert you for I am convinced you would only take to bring to me but this is to assure you I do not want for any thing  Henry  Not wantNor does my father  Eleanor  Scarcely while we visit him Every time he sees us we make him happy but he would never behold us again if we behaved unworthy of him  Henry  What banish us from a prison  Eleanor  And although it is a prison you could not be happy under such a restriction  Henry  HappyWhen was I happy last  Eleanor  Yesterday when your father thanked you for your kindness to him Did we not all three weep with affection for each other and was not that happiness  Henry  It wasnor will I give up such satisfaction for any enticement that can offerBe contented Eleanorfor your sake and my father's I will be honestNay moreI will be scrupulously proud and that line of conduct which my own honour could not force me to follow my love so  you  and  him  shall compel me toWhen through necessity I am tempted to plunder your blushes and my father's anguish shall hold my handAnd when I am urged through impatience to take away my own life your lingering death and his shall check the horrid suggestion and I will live for you  Eleanor  Then do not ever trust yourself away at least from one of us  Henry  Dear sister do you imagine that your power is less when separated from me Do you suppose I think less frequently on my father and his dismal prison because we are not always together Oh no he comes even more forcibly to my thoughts in his absenceand then more bitterly do I feel his misery than while the patient old man before my eyes talks to me of his consolations hi  in e  al comforts from a conscience pure a mind without malice and a  heart where every virtue occupy a placeTherefore do not fear that I should forget either him or you though I might possibly forget myself  Exit  Eleanor  If before him I am cheerful yet to myself I must complain  Weeps  And that sound of festivity at the house adjoining is insupportable especially when I reflect that a very small portion of what will be wasted there only this one night would be sufficient to give my dear father liberty  A rapping at the door of her chamber on the opposite entrance  Eleanor  Who's there  Mr Blackman  Open the door  without  Eleanor  The voice of our landlord  Goes to the door  Is it you Mr Blackman  Blackman  Yes open the door  Rapping louder  She opens it  BLACKMAN  enters followed by  BLUNTLY  Blackman  What a time have you made me wait I And in the name of wonder why do you lock your door Have you any thing to lose Have not you already sold all the furniture you brought hither And are you afraid of being stolen yourself  ELEANOR  retires to the back of the stage  Bluntly  Is this the chamber  Blackman  Yes Sir yes Mr Bluntly this is it  BLACKMAN  assumes a very different tone of voice in speaking to  BLUNTLY  and  ELEANOR  to the one be is all submissive humility to the other all harshness  Bluntly  This  Contemptuously  Blackman  Why yes sirthis is the only place I have left in my own house since your master has been pleased to occupy that next door while his own magnificent one has been repairingLock yourself up indeed  Looking at  ELEANOR  You have been continually asking me for more rooms Mr Bluntly and have not I made near half a dozen doors already from one house to the other on purpose to accommodate your good familyUpon my hanour I have not now a single chamber but what I have let to these lodgers and what I have absolute occasion for myself  Bluntly  And if you do put yourself to a little inconvenience Mr Blackman surely my master  Blackman  Your master Mr Bluntly is a very good mana very generous manand I hope at least he has found me a very lucky one for good luck is all the recommendation which I in my humble station aspire toand since I have been Sir George's attorney I have gained him no less than two lawsuits  Bluntly  I know it I know also that you have lost him four  Blackman  We'll drop the subjectAnd in regard to this room sir it does not suit you say  Bluntly  No for I feel the cold wind blow through every crevice  Blackman  But suppose I was to have it put a little into repair That window for instance shall have a pane or two of glass put in the cracks of the door shall be stopt up and then every thing will have a very different appearance  Bluntly  And why has not this been done before  Blackman  Would you have me be laying out my money while I only let the place at a paltry price to people who I am obliged to threaten to turn into the streets every quarter before I can get my rent from them  Bluntly  Is that the situation of your lodgers at present  Blackman  YesBut they made a better appearance when they first came or I bad not taken such persons to live thus near to your master  Bluntly  That girl  looking at  ELEANOR  seems very prettyand I dare say my master would not care if he was nearer to her  Blackman  Pshaw pshawshe is a poor creature she is in great distress She is misery itself  Bluntly  I feel quite charmed with miseryWho belongs to her  Blackman  A young man who says he is her brothervery likely he is notbut that I should not enquire about if they could pay my rent If people  will pay me I don't care what they are  Addressing himself to  ELEANOR  I desire you will tell your brother when he comes in that I have occasion for the money which will be due to me tomorrowand if I don't receive it before tomorrow night he must seek some other habitation  Bluntly  Hush Mr Blackmanif you speak so loud you will have our company in the next house hear you  Blackman  And if they did do you think it would spoil their dancing No Mr BluntlyAnd in that respect I am a person of fashionI never suffer any distress to interfere with my enjoyments  Eleanor  Coming to him  Dear sir have but patience a little while longerIndeed I hope you will lose nothing  Blackman  I  won't  lose any thing  Going  Eleanor  Following him  Sir I would speak a single word to you if you will be so good as to hear me  Bluntly  Ay stay and hear her  Eleanor  Looking at  BLUNTLY  But I wish to speak to him by ourselves  Bluntly  Then I'll withdraw  Blackman  What have you to say  In anger  Bluntly  Hear her Mr Blackmanor may none of her sex ever listen to you  Exit  Blackman  If it is only to entreat me to let you continue here I am gone in an instantCome speak quickly for I have no time to loseCome speak speak  Eleanor  But are you resolved to have no pity You know in what a helpless situation we areand the deplorable state of my poor father  Weeping  Blackman  Ay I thought what you had to say farew  l farewel  Eleanor  Lying hold of him  Oh do not plunge us into more distress than we can bear but open your heart to compassion  Blackman  I can't'tis a thing I never did in my life  Going he meets  BLUNTLY  who stops him  Bluntly  Well have you granted her request  Blackman  I would do a great deal to oblige you Mr Bluntlyand if you will only give your word for the trifle of rent owing why I am not so hardhearted but I will suffer her to stay  Bluntly  Well wellI will give my word  Blackman  But remember it is not to be put down  to your master's account but to your ownI am not to give credit  Eleanor  Not am I to lay my brother under an obligation of this nature  To  BLUNTLY  I thank you for your offer sir but I cannot accept it  Blackman  In extreme anger  What do you mean by that  Bluntly  Perhaps she is right  Eleanor  My brother would resent my acceptance of a favour from a stranger  Blackman  Your brother resent A poor man resent Did you ever hear of any body's regarding a poor man's resentment  Eleanor  Nonor a poor woman's prayers  Blackman  Yes I will regard your prayers if you will suffer this gentleman to be your friend  Eleanor  Any acquaintance of your's Mr Blackman I must distrust  Blackman  Do you hear with what contempt she treats us both  Bluntly  But perhaps she is rightat least in treating one of us so I am sure she isand I will forgive her wronging the one for the sake of her doing justice to the other  Enter  HENRY  he starts at seeing  BLACKMAN  and  BLUNTLY  Henry  Who are these  Blackman  "Who are these" Did you ever hear such impertinence  Going up to him  Pray who are you sir  Henry  I am a man  Blackman  Yesbut I am a lawyer  Henry  Whatever you are this apartment is mine not your'sand I desire  you  to leave it  Blackman  But tomorrow it will be mine and then I shall desire you to leave it and force you to leave it  Henry  Eleanor retire to the other chamber am I sorry I left you  Leads her off  Blackman  And I am sorry that I and my friend should come here to be affronted  Bluntly  Mr Blackman I won't be called names  Blackman  Names sir What names did I call you  Bluntly  Did not you call me your friend I assure you sir I am not used to be called names I am but a servant whose character is every thing and I'll let you know that I am  not  your friend  Blackman  Why you blockhead does not your master call himself my friend  Bluntly  Yes my master is a great man and he can get a place without a characterbut if I lose mine I am ruined therefore take care how you miscal me for the future for I assure you I won't bear it I am not your friend and you shall find I am not  Exit  in great anger  BLACKMAN  following  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  An Apartment at  SIR GEORGE SPLENDORVILLE'S  Enter  SIR GEORGE  followed by  BLUNTLY  Sir George  WHAT's o'clock  Rubbing his eyes  Bluntly  Just noon sir  Sir George  Why was I waked so early  Bluntly  You were not waked sirYou rung  Sir George  Then it was in my sleepand could not you suppose soAfter going to bed at five to make me rise at noon  in a violent passion  What am I to do with myself sir till it is time to go out for the evening  Bluntly  You have company to dinner you know sir  Sir George  No it is to supperand what am I to do with myself till that time  Bluntly  Company again to supper Sir  Sir George  Yes and the selfsame company I had last nightI invited them upon Lady Caroline's accountto give her an opportunity of revenge for the money she lost here yesterday eveningand I am all wearinessI am all lassitude and fretfulness till the time arrivesBut now I call to mind I have an affair that may engage my attention a few hours You were giving me an account Bluntly of that beautiful girl I saw enter at Blackman's  Bluntly  Yes sir I saw her late last night in Mr Blackman's houseshe lodges there  Sir George  Indeed In Blackman's house I am glad to hear it  Bluntly  And he has assured me sir that she and her family are in the greatest poverty imaginable  Sir George  I am glad to hear it  Bluntly  They have been it seems above a twelvemonth in London in search of some rich relations but instead of meeting with them the father was seen and remembered by an old creditor who has thrown him into prison  Sir George  I am very glad to hear it  Bluntly  But the young woman Sir has been so short a time in town she has seemingly a great deal of modesty and virtue  Sir George  And I am very glad to hear of that tooI like her the betteryou know I dofor I am  weary of that ready compliance I meet with from the sex  Bluntly  But if I might presume to advise siras you are so soon to be married to her ladyship whom you love with sincere affection you should give up this pursuit  Sir George  And I  shall  give it up Bluntly before my marriage takes placefor short as that time may be I expect this passion will be over and forgotten long before the interval has passed awayBut that brother you were mentioning  Bluntly  I have some reason to think that with all his poverty he has a notion of honour  Sir George  Laughing  Oh I have often tried the effect of a purse of gold with people of honour Have you desired them to be sent for as I ordered  Bluntly  I have Sir  Sir George  See if they are come  Exit  BLUNTLY  Ah my dear Lady Caroline it is you and only you whom I love with a sincere passion but in waiting this long expected event of our marriage permit me to indulge some less exalted wishes  Enter  BLUNTLY  Sir Gorge  Are they come  Bluntly  The young man is in the antichamber sir but his sister is not with him  Speaking to  HENRY  who is without  Please to walk this waymy master desires to see you  Sir George  No no noI do not desire to see him if his sister is not thereZounds you scoundrel what did you call him in for  Enter  HENRY  and bows  SIR GEORGE  looks at him with a careless familiarity  BLUNTLY  leaves the room  Sir George  Young man I am told you are very pooryou may have heard that I am very richand I suppose you are acquainted with the extensive meaning of the wordgenerosity  Henry  After an hesitation  Perhaps not sir  Sir George  The meaning of it as I comprehend is for the rich to give to the poorHave you any thing to ask of me in which I can serve you  Henry  Your proposal is so general I am at a loss what to answerbut you are no doubt acquainted with the extensive meaning of the word  pride  and that will apologize for the seeming indifference with which I receive your offer  Sir George  Your pride seems extensive indeedI heard your father was in prison and I pitied him  Henry  Did you SirDid you pity my father I beg your pardonif I have said any thing to offend you pray forgive itnor let my rudeness turn your compassion away from him to any other object  Sir George  Would a small sum release him from confinement Would about a hundred pounds  Henry  I have no doubt but it would  Sir George  Then take that noteBe not surprisedI mean to dispose of a thousand guineas this way instead of fitting up a theatre in my own house That  giving him the note  is a mere trifle my box at the opera or my dinner I mean to dine alone tomorrow instead of inviting company  Henry  Sir George I spoke so rudely to you at first that I know no other way to shew my humility than to accept your present without reluctanceI do therefore as the gift of benevolence not as the insult of better for une  Sir George  You have a brother have not you  Henry  No Sirand only one sister  Sir George  A sister is it well let me see your father and your brotheryour sister I meandid not you sayyou said a sister did not you  Henry  Yes Sir  Sir George  We'l let me see your father and her they will rejoice at their good fortune I imagine and I wish to be a witness of their joy  Henry  I will this moment go to our lawyer extricate my father and we will all return and make you the spectator of the happiness you have bestowed  Forgive my eagerness to disclose your bounty sir if before I have said half I feel I fly to reveal it to my  father to whom I can more powerfully express my sensationsthan in your presence  Exit  Sir George  That bait has takenand now if the sister will only be as grateful  Enter  BLUNTLY  Bluntly  Dear sir what can you have said to the young man I never saw a person so much affected  Sir George  In what manner  Bluntly  The tears ran down his cheeks as he passed along and he held something in his Land which he pressed to his lips and then to his heart as if it was a treasure  Sir George  It  is  a treasure Bluntlya hundred Guineas  Bluntly  But for which I believe you expect a greater treasure in return  Sir George  Dost think so Bluntlydost think the girl is worth a hundred pounds  Bluntly  If she refuses she is worth a thousand but if the complies you have thrown away your money  Sir George  Just the reverse  Bluntly  But I hope sir you do not mean to throw away any more thusfor although this sum by way of charity may be well applied yet indeed  sirâª I know some of your creditors as much in want as this poor family  Sir George  HowYou are in pay by some of my creditors I suppose  Bluntly  No Sir you must pay them before they can pay any body  Sir George  You are impertinentleave the room instantly and go in search of this sister now while the son is gone to release his fatherTell her her brother is here and bring her hither immediately  Bluntly  But sir if you will only give me leave to speak one word  Sir George  Do speak  Goes to the chimney piece and takes down a pistol  only speak a single syllable and I'll send a ball instantly through your head  Bluntly I am dumb SirI don't speak indeed Sirupon my life I don't I wish I may die if I speak a word  Sir George  Go on the errand I told you and if you dare to return without the girl this is your fate  Holding up the pistol  Bluntly  Yes Sir  Exit  Sir George  Laying the  pistol  on the table  Impertinent puppy to ruffle the temper of a man of fashion with hints of prudence and morality and paying his debtsall this from a servant too The insolent chattering  Enter  BLUNTLY  Bluntly  May I speak now sir  Sir George  What have you to say  Bluntly  Mr Blackman sir  Sir George  Bid him come in  Enter  BLACKMAN  Exit  BLUNTLY  Sir George  Good morning Mr Blackman come sit down  Blackman  Bowing respectfully  I am glad Sir George I have found you alone for I come to speak to you on important business  Sir George  Businessnonot now if you please  Blackman  But I must sirI have been here ten times before and have been put off but now you must hear what I have to say  Sir George  Don't be long thendon't be tedious Mr Blackmanfor I expect a ain short I expect a pretty woman  Blackman  When she comes I will go  Sir George  Very well speak quickly then What have you to say  Blackman  I come to speak upon the subject of your father's will by which you know you run the hazard of losing great part of what he left behind  Sir George  But what am I to do  Blackman  There is no time to be lost Consider that Mr Manly the lawyer whom your father employed is a man who pretends to a great deal of morality and it was he who when your father found himself dying alarmed his conscience and persuaded him to make this Will in favour of a second person Now I think that you and I both together ought to have a meeting with this conscientious lawyer  Sir George  But I should imagine Mr Blackman that if he is really a conscientious man you and he will not be upon good terms  Blackman  Oh people of our avocation differ in respect to conscience Puzzle confound and abuse each other and yet are upon good terms  Sir George  But I fear  Blackman  Fear nothing There are a vast number o  resources in our artIt is so spacious and yet so confinedso sublime and yet so profoundso d  stinct and yet so complicatedthat if ever this person with whom your fortune is divided should be found I know how to envelope her in a labyrinth where she shall be lost again in a hurryBut your father's lawyer being a very honestI mean a very p  rticular man in his professionI have reason to fear we cannot gain him over to our purposeIf therefore  Enter  BLUNTLY  Sir George  My visitor is come as I told you  Blackman  Rising  And I am gone as I told you  Going  Enter  ELEANOR  Blackman  Aside  My lodger ah ah  To her in a whisper  You may stay another quarter  Exit  Sir George  To  Eleanor  I am glad to see youBluntly  Makes a sig  to him to leave the room  Bluntly  Sir  SIR GEORGE  waves his hand and nods his head a second time  Bluntly  S  r  Sti  l affecting not to understand him  Sir George  I  id you go  Angrily  Bluntly  You bid me go sirOh yes sirVery well sirBut indeed sir I did not hear you before sirIndeed I did not  Bows and exit with reluctance which  ELEANOR  observes  Eleanor  Pardon me sirI understood my brother was here but I find he is not  Sir George  He is but this instant gone and will  return immediatelyStay then with me till he comes  Takes her hand  Surely you cannot refuse to remain with me a few moments especially as I hive a great deal to say to you that may tend to your advantage  Why do you c  st your eyes with such impatience on that doo  Goes and locks it  There now you may look at it in vain  Eleanor  For heaven sake why am I locked in  Sir George  Because you should not escape  Eleanor  That makes me resolve I willOpen the door sir  Going to it  Sir George  Nay listen to me Your sentiments I make no doubt are formed from books  Eleanor  No from misfortunesyet more instructive  Sir George  You shall never know misfortune more you nor your relationsBut this moment I presented your brother with a sum of money and he left me with professions of the deepest gratitude  Eleanor  My brotherHas he received money from you Ah he promised me he'd not disgrace his family  Sir George  How Family indeed  Eleanor  I cannot remain here a moment longer Open the door siropen it immediately  Raising her voice  Bluntly  Without  Sir sir siropen the door if you pleaseyou are wanted sir  Sir George  S'death who can want me in such haste  Opens the door

touch heror to stay another moment in the roomBegone  BLUNTLY  looks at  ELEANOR  aside and points to the pistol then bows humbly and retires  Sir George  And now my fair Lucretia  He is going to seize hershe takes up the pistol and presents it  Eleanor  No it's not  myself  I'll kill'Tis you  Sir George  Starting  Nay nay nay lay it  downLay that foolish thing down I beg you will  Trembling

I have  Sir George  I am not joking  Bluntly  Nor am I sir  Sir George  And do not you think I should behave very well if I was to discharge you my service  Bluntly  As well as can be expected sir  Sir George  Why did you break in upon me just now Did you think I was going to murder the girl  Bluntly  No sir I suspected neither love nor murder  Sir George  What then did you suspect  Bluntly  Why sir if I may make bold to speak I was afraid the poor girl might be robbed and of all she is worth in the world  Sir George  Blockhead I suppose you mean her virtue  Smiling with contempt  Bluntly  Why to say the truth sir virtue is a currency that grows scarce in the world nowadays and some men are so much in need of it that they think nothing of stopping a harmless female passenger in her road through life and plundering her or it without remorse though its loss embitters every hour she must afterwards pass in her journey  Enter  HENRY  Henry  Sir George my father liberated from prison by your bounty is come gratefully to offer  Enter  WILFORD  and  ELEANOR  Eleanor  Holding her father by the hand to prevent his going forward  Oh my father whither are you going Turn back turn back

owe to youor how describe those emotions which your goodness at this moment makes me feel  Sir George  In confusion  Very wellvery wellhis all very well  Aside  I wish it was  To him  I am glad I have been of service to you  Wilford  You have been like mercy to us all My daughter's gratitude overflows in tearsBut why my child do you keep apart from us Can you be too timid to confess your obligation  Sir George  Let her alonelet her indulge her humour  Wilford  Speak Eleanor  Sir George  No I had rather she would be silent  Wilford  You offend me by this obstinacy  Eleanor  Going to  WILFORD  and taking his hand  Oh my fatherOh I cannotI cannot speak  Wilford  WhereforeExplain this moment what agitates you thus  Eleanor  You must return to confinement again  Wilford  How  Eleanor  The money that has set you free was given for the basest purposesand by a man as far beneath you in principle as you are beneath him in fortune Disdain the obligationand come my father return to prison  Wilford  YesAnd with more joy than I left it  To  SIR GEORGE  Joy in my daughter's virtuous contempt of thee  To his children  Leave the house instantly  Exit  HENRY  and  ELEANOR  Wilford  Addressing himself to  SIR GEORGE  Your present is but deposited in a lawyer's hands whose word gained my libertyhe shall immediately return it to you while I return to imprisonment  Sir George  If the money is in a lawyer's hands my good friend it may be some time before you get it returned  Going  Wilford  Stay Sir George  he returns  And look me in the face while you insult me  SIR GEORGE  looks on the floor  You cannotI therefore triumph while you stand before me abashed like a culprit Yet be assured unthinking dissipated man that with all your insolence and cruelty towards me and mine I have still the charity to rejoice even for your sake at seeing you thus confounded This shame is at least one trait in your favour and while it revenges my wrongs gives me joy to find you are not a  hardened  libertine  Exeunt  END Of THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  The apartment at  SIR GEORGE SPLENDORVILLE's  where the night has been passed at playSeveral card tables with company playing  SIR GEORGE

Mr Lucre  Fifteen thousand guineas and I have not won one of themOh confusion upon every thing that has prevented me  Sir George  Taking  LADY CAROLINA  aside  Lady Caroline you are the sole person who has profited  by my lossProve to me that your design was not to ruin me to sink me into the abyss of misfortuneprove to me you love me in return for all my tender love to you And  taking up the cards  give me my revenge in one single cut  Lady Caroline  If this is the proof you require I consent  Sir George  Thank youAnd it is for double or quitThank you  She shuffles and cuts  Sir George  Ay it will be minethank youI shall be the winnerthank you  He cutsthen tears the cards and throws them on the floor  DestractionFuries of the blackest kind conspire against me and all their serpents are in my heart Cruel yet beloved woman Could you thus abuse and take advantage of the madness of my situation  Lady Caroline  Your misfortunes my dear Sir Georgemake you blind  Sir George  Taking her again aside  No they have rather opened my eyes and have shown me what you areStill an object I adore but I now perceive you are one to my ruin devotedIf any other intention had directed you would you have thus decoyed me to my follyYou know my proneness to play your own likelihood of success and have palpably allured me to my destruction Un+grateful woman you never loved me but taught me to believe so in order to partake of my prodigality  Do not be suspicious madam the debt shall be discharged within a week  Lady Caroline  With the utmost indifference  That will do sirI depend upon your word and that will do  Exit curtsying  Sir George  Ungratefulcruelshe is gone without giving me one hopeShe even insultsdespises me  Mr Lucre  Coming forward  Indeed my dear friend I compassionate your ill luck most feelingly and yet I am nearly as great an object of compassion on this occasion as yourself for I have not won a single guinea of all your losses if I had why I could have borne your misfortune with some sort of patience  Lady Bridget  My dear Sir George your situation affects me so extremely I cannot stay a moment longer in your presence  Goes to the door and returns  But you may depend upon my prayers  Exit  Lord Hazard  Sir George if I had any consolation to offer it should be at your servicebut you know you are convincedI have merely a sufficiency of consolationthat is of friends and of money to support myself in the rank of life I hold in the world For without thatwithout that rankI sincerely wish you a good morning  Exit  LORD HAZARD  Sir George  Good morning  The company by degrees all steal out of the room except  Mr LUCRE  Sir George  Looking around  Where are all my gueststhe greatest part gone without a word in condolence and the rest torturing me with insulting wishes Here behold here is the sole reliance which I have prepared for the hour of misfortune and what is itwordscomplimentsdesertion and from those whose ingratitude makes their neglect still more poignant  Turns and perceives  Mr LUCRE  Lucre my dear Lucre are not you amazed at what you see  Mr Lucre  No not at all'tis the way of the worldwe caress our acquaintances whilst they are happy and in power but if they fall into misfortune we think we do enough if we have the good nature to pity them  Sir George  And are you one of these friends  Mr Lucre  I am like the rest of the worldI was in the number of your flatterers but at present you have nonefor you may already perceive we are grown sincere  Sir George  But have not you a thousand times desired me in any distress to prove you  Mr Lucre  And you do prove me now do you not Heaven bles  you  Shaking hands with him  I shall always have a regard for youbut for any  thing fartherI scorn professions which I do not mean to keep  Going  Sir George  Nay but Lucre consider the anguish in which you leave meconsider that to be forsaken by my friends is more affecting than the loss of all my fortune Though you have nothing else to give me yet give me your company  Mr Lucre  My dear friend I  cannot  Reflect that I am under obligations to youso many indeed that I am ashamed to see youI am naturally bashful and do not be surprised if I should never have the confidence to look you in the face again  Exit  Sir George  This is the world such as I have heard it described but not such as I could ever believe it to beBut I forgiveI forget all the world except Lady Carolinehere ingratitude fastens to my heart and drives me to despair She on whom I have squandered so muchshe whom I lovedand whom I still love spite of her perfidy  Enter  BLUNTLY  Well Bluntlybehold the friendship of the friends I loved This morning I was in prosperity and had manythis night I am ruined and I have not one  Bluntly  Ruined sir  Sir George  Totally and shall be forced to part with every thing I possess to pay the sum I owe  Of course I shall part with all my servantsand do you endeavour to find some other place  Bluntly  But first sirpermit me to ask a favour of you  Sir George  A favour of me I have no favours now to grant  Bluntly  I beg your pardon siryou have one and I entreat it on my knees  Sir George  What would you ask of me  Bluntly  To remain along with you stillI will never quit you but serve you for nothing to the last moment of my life  Sir George  I have then one friend left  Embracing him  And never will I forget to acknowledge the obligation  Enter  BLACKMAN  Blackman  Pardon mesirI beg ten thousand pardonspray excuse meâª  In the most servile manner  for entering before I sent to know if you were at leisurebut your attendants are all  st asleep on the chairs of your antichamberI could not wake a souland I imagined you yourself were not yet up  Sir George  On the contrary I have not yet been in bed And when I do go there I wi  h never to rise from it again  Blackman  Has any thing unexpected happenedâª  Sir George  YesThat I am ruinedinevitably ruinedBehold  Shewing the cards  the only wreck of my fortune  Blackman  Starting  Lost all your fortune  Sir George  All I am worthand as much more as I am worth  BLACKMAN  draws a chair sits dawn with great familiarity and stares  SIR GEORGE  rudely in the face  Blackman  Lost all you are worth He he he he  Laughs maliciously  Pretty news truly Why then I suppose I have lost great part of what I am worth all which you are indebted to meHowever there is a way yet to retrieve you Butplease to desire your servant to leave the room  Sir George  Bluntly leave us a moment  Exit  BLUNTLY  Well Mr Blackman what is this grand secret  Blackman  Why in the state to which you have reduced yourself there is certainly no one hope for you but in that portion that half of your fortune which the will of your father keeps you out of  Sir George  But how am I to obtain it The lawyer in whose hands it is placed will not give it up without being insured from any future demand by some certain proofs  Blackman  And suppose I should search and  find proofs Suppose I have them already by me But upon this occasion you must not only rely implicitly on what I say but it is necessary you should say the same yourself  Sir George  If you advance no falsehood I cannot have any objection  Blackman  FalsehoodfalsehoodI apprehend Sir George you do not consider that there is a particular construction put upon words and phrases in the practice of the law which the rest of the world out of that study are not clearly acquainted with For instance  falsehood  with  us  is not  exactly  what it is with other people  Sir George  How Is truth immutable truth to be corrupted and confounded by men of the law  Blackman  I was not speaking of truththat we have nothing to do with  Sir George  I must not say so however sir And in this crisis of my sufferings it is the only comfort the only consolatory reflection left me that truth and I will never separate  Blackman  Stick to your truthbut confide in me as usualYou will go with me then to Mr Manly your father's lawyer and corroborate all that I shall say  Sir George  Tell me but what you intend to say  Blackman  I can't do that In the practice of the law we never know what we intend to sayand  therefore our blunders when we make them are in some measure excusableand if I should chance to make a blunder or two I mean any trivial mistake when we come before this lawyer you must promise not to interfere or in any shape contradict me  Sir George  A mere lapse of memory I have nothing to do with  Blackman  And my memory grows very bad therefore you must not disconcert me  Sir George  Come let us begoneI am ready to go with you this moment  Blackman  I must first go home and prepare a few writings  Sir George  But call to mind that I rely upon your honour  Blackman  Do you think Bluntly your servant is an honest man  Sir George  I am sure he is  Blackman  Then to quiet your fears I will take him along with us and you will depend on what he shall say I make no doubt  Sir George  I would stake my being upon his veracity  Blackman  Call him in then and bid him do as I command him  Sir George  Here Bluntly  Enter  BLUNTLY  Mr Blackman has some business with youlisten to him with attention and follow his directions  Exit  Blackman  You know I suppose the perilous situation of your master  BLUNTLY  shakes his head and wipes his eyes  Blackman  Good fellow good fellowand you would I dare say do any thing to rescue him from the misery with which he is surrounded  Bluntly  I would lay down my life  Blackman  You can do it for less Only put on a black coat and the business is done  Bluntly  What's that all Oh if I can save him by putting on a black coat I'll go buy mourning and wear it all my life  Bla  kman  There's a good fellow I sincerely thank you for this attachment to your master  Shaking him by the hand  Bluntly  My dear Blackman I beg your pardon for what I am going to say but as you behave thus friendly on this unfortunate occasion I must confess to youthat till now I always hated youI could not bear the sight of youFor I thought you I wish I may die if I did not one of the greatest rogues in the world I fancied you only waited on and advised my master to make your market of him But now your attention to him in his distress when  all his friends have forsaken him is so kindHeaven bless youHeaven bless youI'll go buy a black coat  Going  Blackman  I have something more to say to you When you have put on this coat you must meet your master and meat Mr Manley's the lawyer and when we are all there you must mind and say exactly what I say  Bluntly  And what will that be  Blackman  Oh something  Bluntly  I have no objection to say something but I hope you won't make me say any thing  Blackman  You seem to doubt me once more sir  Bluntly  No I am doubling you now for the first time for I always thought I was  certain  before  Blackman  And will you not venture to say yes and no to what I shall advance  Bluntly  WhyI think I may venture to say yes to your no and no to your yes with a safe conscience  Blackman  If you do not instantly follow me and do all that I shall propose your master is ruined Would you see him dragged to prison  Bluntly  No I would sooner go myself  Blackman  Then why do you stand talking about a safe conscience Half my clients would have been ruined if I had shewn my zeal as you do Conscience indeed Why this is a matter of law to serve your master in his necessity  Bluntly  I have heard necessity has no lawbut if it has no conscience it is a much worse thing than I took it forNo matter for thatcome alongOh my poor masterI would even tell a  lie  to save him  Exeunt  SCENE II  A lawyer's study  MR MANLY  discovered at his writingdeska Servant attending  Manly  Who do you say

has not yet paid away this money still he refuses to restore it to me though in return I again render up my person  Manly  And why would you do this  Wilford  Because my honourI mean my consciencefor that's the poor man's honouris concerned  Manly  Explain yourself  Wilford  A son of mine received this sum I speak of and thought it  given  him while it was only meant as a purchasea purchase of what we had no right to selland therefore it must be restored to the owner  Manly  And who is he  Wilford  Sir George SplendorvilleI suppose you have heard of him  Manly  He you mean who by the desire of his father's will lately changed his name from Blandford  Wilford  Sir  Manly  The name which some part of the family while reduced had taken  Wilford  Good Heaven Is there such a circumstance in his story  Manly  Why do you ask with such emotion  Wilford  Because he is the man in search of whom I left my habitation in the country to present before him a destitute young woman a near relation  Manly  What relationBe particular in your answer  Wilford  A sister  Manly  I thank you for your intelligence You have named a person who for those three years past I have in vain endeavoured to findBut did you say she was in poverty  Wilford  I did  Manly  I give you joy thenfor I have in my possession a deed which conveys to a lost daughter of Sir George's father the other half of the fortune he bequeathed his sonbut as yet all my endeavours have been in vain to find where she and an uncle to whose care she was entrusted in her infancy are retired  Wilford  Tu  ning to  ELEANOR  Now Eleanor arm yourself with fortitudewith fortitude to bear not the frowns but the smiles of fortune Be humble collected and the same you have ever been while I for the first time inform youyou are not my daughterAnd from this gentleman's intelligence add you are richyou are the deceased Blandford's child and Splendorville's sister  Eleanor  Oh Heavens Do I lose a father such as you to gain a brother such as he is  Manly  To  WILFORD  There can be no mistake on this occasionAnd you if I am not deceived are the brother of the late Mr Blandford Your looks your person your very voice confirms it  Wilford  I have writings in my care shall prove  it beyond a doubt with the whole narrative of our separation when he with his son then a youth embarked for India where I suppose riches soon succeeded poverty  Enter  SERVANT  Servant  Lady Caroline Seymour sir is at the door in her carriage and will not be denied admittance She says she must see you upon some very urgent business  Manly  To  WILFORD  and  ELEANOR  Will you do me the favour to step for a moment into this room Lady Caroline will not stay long I'll not detain you  Exit  WILFORD  and  ELEANOR  Enter  LADY CAROLINE  Lady Caroline  Dear Mr Manly I haven a thousand apologies to makeAnd yet I am sure you will excuse the subject of my visit when you consider  Manly  Your ladyship will please to sit down  He draws chairs and they sit  Lady Caroline  You cannot be ignorant Mr Manlyyou must know the terms of acquaintance on which Sir George Splendorville and I have been for some time pastyou were his father's agent his chief solicitor and although you are not employed by Sir George yet the state of his affairs cannot  not be concealed from youHas he or has he not any inheritance yet to come  Manly  Pardon me madamthough not entrusted by Sir George I will nevertheless keep his secrets  Lady Caroline  That is plainly telling me he is worth nothing  Manly  By no meansSir George in spite of his profusion must still be rich He has preserved his large estate in Wales and as to money I do not doubt but he has a considerable sum  Lady Caroline  Not a guinea I won it all from him last night  Manly  You You who are to become his wife  Lady Caroline  I might had I notbeen thus fortunate But why should I marry him when his riches are mine without that ceremony  Manly  Inconsiderate manwhat will be the end of his imprudence Yet Heaven be praised he has still that fine estate I just now mentioned  Lady Caroline  Indeed he has notthat has belonged to me these three months  Manly  To you  Lady Caroline  YesBought for me under another name by agents and for half its value  Manly  MadmanYet your ladyship must excuse me I know your income stinted and all the  death of the Earl your father where could you raise sufficient to make even half the purchase  Lady Caroline  From Splendorville's own prodigalityfrom lavish presents made to me by him  Enter  SERVANT  Servant  Sir George Splendorville sir desires to speak with youhe is at the door with Mr Blackman  Lady Caroline  Oh Heavens do not let him see me here  She is hastening to the room where  WILLFORD  and his daughter are  Manly  I have company therewalk in here if you please  Shows her another door and she enters  Manly  To the servant  Desire Sir George to walk in  Enter  Sir GEORGE  and  BLACKMAN  Manly  Sir George do me the favour to sit down  He looks coolly on  BLACKMAN  and pointing to a chair says  Good morning  They sit  Sir George  Mr Manly my attorney will let you know the business on which I am come  Blackman  Why yes Mr Manly it is extremely hard that Sir George has for so long a time been kept out of a very large part of his fortune particularly as he has had occasion for it  Sir George  I have had occasion for it I assure you Mr Manly and I have occasion for it at this very time  Mr Manly  But so may the person sir from whom you would take it In a word Sir George neither your lawyer nor you shall prevail on me to give up the trust reposed in me by your father without certain evidence that your sister will never come to make her claim  Blackman  You are not afraid of ghosts are you  Manly  No nor of robbers eitheryou cannot frighten me Mr Blackman  Blackman  Then depend upon it the sister of Sir George can never appear in any other manner than as a spirit For here sir  taking from his pocket a parcel of papers  here are authentic letters to prove her death  SIR GEORGE  looks confused  Manly  Her death  Blackman  Yes her death Here is a certificate from the curate of the parish in which she was buried  Manly  Buried too  Blackman  Yes sir buried Here is also an affidavit from the sexton of the said village signed bys the overseer and churchwardens testifying the fame You see  shewing him the paper and reading at the same time  "Died Anno Domini one thousand  seven hundred and eightynine the seventeenth of June  Mr  MANLY  takes the paper and while he is reading  SIR GEORGE  says apart    Sir George  How near to the brink of infamy has my imprudence led me And s'death my confusion takes from me the power to explain and expose the scoundrel  Mr Manly I will leave you for the present but you shall hear from me shortlywhen this matter shall be accounted for clearlyperfectly to your satisfaction you may depend upon it  Going  Manly  Stay Sir George and  Blackman  Aye Sir George stay and see Mr Manly's  jections wholly removed He seems to doubt the evidence of paper I must therefore beg leave to produce a living witnessthe gentleman whom I appointed to meet me here  Manly  And who is he  Blackman  The apothecary who attended Sir George's sister in her dying illness  Sir GEORGE  starts  Manly  Desire him to walk in by all means What is the matter Sir George you look discomposed  Blackman  Sir George is something nervous Mr Manly and you know the very name of a medical gentleman will affect the nerves of some people  BLACKMAN  goes to the door and leads on  BLUNTLY  dressed in mourning  Sir George  Aside  BluntlyBut I will see the end of this  Manly  Bowing to him  You are an apothecary I think sir  BLUNTLY  looks at  BLACKMAN  Blackman  Yes sir  Bluntly  After seeming inclined to say  No  Yes sir  Manly  Pray sir what disorder took the young lady on whose account you have been brought hither out of the world  BLUNTLY  looks at  BLACKMAN  Blackman  Oh the old disorder I suppose  Bluntly  The old disorder  Manly  And pray wh  t may that be sir  BLACKMAN  offers to reply  Mr Blackman please to let this gentleman speak for himselfWhat is it you mean pray sir by the old disorder  Bluntly  IImeanLove sir  Manly  You will not pretend to say that love was the cause of her death  Bluntly  Confused and hesitating  Thatand a few  its of the gout  Manly  I fear sir you are not in perfect health yourselfyou tremble and look very pale  Blackman  That is because the subject affects him  Manly  Do you then never mention the young lady without being affected  Bluntly  Never sirfor had you seen her as I didumHad you seen herShe was in very great danger from the first but after I attended her she was in greater danger stillI advised a physician to be called in on which she grew worseWe had next a consultation of physicians and then it was all over with her  Sir George  Rising from his chair  Blackman this is too muchall my calamities are inferior to this Desist therefore or  Blackman  To Bluntly  DesistHe cannot bear to hear the pathetic description Consider the lady was his sisterand though he had not the pleasure of knowing heryet poor thing  affecting to weep  poor young woman he cannot help lamenting her lose  Bluntly  No more can Ifor though she was not my relationyet she was my Patient  pretending to weep also  Sir George  I can bear no moreMr Manly you are imposed upon But think not however appearances may be against me that I came here as the tool of so infamous a deceitThoughtlessness Mr Manly has embarrassed my circumstances and thoughtlessness alone has made me employ a villain to retrieve them  Blackman  Mighty fine  Sir George  I have no authority sir to affirm that my sister is not alive and I am confident the account you have just now heard of her death is but an artifice My indiscretions have reduced me nearly to beggary but I will perish in confinementcheerfully perishrather than owe my affluence to one dishonourable action  Blackman  Grief has turned his brain  Manly  Sir George I honour your feelings and as for the feelings of these gentlemen I am extremely happy that it is in my power to dry up their tears and calm all their sorrows  Sir George  Sir  Blackman  How In what way  Manly  Going to the door where  WILFORD  and his niece are  Come forth young lady to the arms of a brother and relieve the anguish of these mourners who are lamenting your decase  ELEANOR  and  WILLFORD  enter  Yes Sir George here is that sister whom those gentlemen assure us is dead and this is the brother of your fatherThese are proofs as convincing I hope as any Mr Blackman can produce  Sir George  She my sister Her pretended father my uncle too  Aside  Blackman you would have plunged me into an anguish I never knew before you would have plunged me into shame  Bluntly  And so you  have  me  Blackman  PshawMr Manly notwithstanding you are these people's voucher this appears but a schemeThese persons are but adventurers and may possibly have about them forgeries such as an honest man like myself would shudder at  Manly  Going to the door  Who's there  Enter Servant  Shew thatthat Mr Blackman out of my house instantly and take care you never admit him again  Blackman  Sir George will you suffer this  Sir George  Aye and a great deal more  Bluntly  Look'ee BlackmanIf you don't fall down upon your knees and beg my pardon at the street door for the trick you have put upon me in assuring me my master's sister was really dead and that I could do her no injury by doing him a service if you don't beg my pardon for this I'll give you such an assault and battery as you never had to do with in your life  Blackman  Beat medo beat meI'll thank you for beating meI'd be beat every hour of the day to recover damages  Exit with  BLUNTLY  Sir George  My sisterwith the sincerest joy I call you by that nameand while I thus embrace you offer you a heart that beats with all the pure and tender affection which our kindred to each other claimsIn you  embracing his uncle  I behold my  father and experience an awful fear mingled with my regard  Wilford  Continue still that regard and even that fearthese filial sentiments may prove important and they shall ever be repaid with my paternal watchings friendship and love  Eleanor  My brother  Sir George  I have been unworthy of youI will be so no more but imitate your excellence Yet when I reflect  LADY CAROLINE  comes softly from the inner apartment and attends to the discourse  Eleanor  My brother do not imagine  Sir George  Leave me leave me to all the agonies of my misconduct Where is my fortune Now  all  irrecoverably goneMy last my only resource is now to be paid to anotherI have lost every thing  Lady Caroline  Coming forward  No Sir George  nothing  since I possess all that was yours  Sir George  How  Lady Caroline  Behold a friend in your necessities a mistress whom your misfortunes cannot drive away but who experiencing much of your unkindness still loves you and knowing your every folly will still submit to honour and obey you  I received your lavish presents but to hoard them for youmade myself mistress of your fortune but to return it to youand with it all my own  Sir George  Can this be real Can I be raised in one moment from the depths of misery to unbounded happiness  Enter  SERVANT  Servant  A young man who says he is Mr Willford's son is called to enquire for him  Manly  Shew him in  SIR GEORGE  and  LADY CAROLINE  retire to the back part of the stage  Enter  HENRY  Wilford  Come Henry and take leave of your sister for ever  Henry  How so sirWhat do you mean To be parted from her would be the utmost rigour of fortune  Manly  The affection with which you speak young gentleman seems to convey something beyond mere brotherly love  Wilford  I some years since revealed to him she was  not  his sister  Eleanor  And he some years since implied it to me Yet in such doubtful terms I knew not which of us had the sorrow not to be your childI now find it is myselfand I aver it to be a sorrow for which all the fortune I am going to possess will not repay me  Sir George  Then my dearest sister indulge the hope you may yet be his daughter This young  man's merit deserves a reward and in  time  he may learn to love you by a still nearer tie than that you have so long known to exist between you nay even by a nearer tie than that of brother  Henry  I am in doubt or what I hearEleanor since our short separation there cannot surely have been any important discovery  Manly  Be not surprisedgreat discoveries which we labour in vain for years to make are frequently brought about in one lucky moment without any labour at all  Sir George  Truefor till this day arose I had passed every hour since my birth without making one discovery to my advantagewhile this short but propitious morning has discovered to mehow to be in future happy  THE END  EPILOGUE
