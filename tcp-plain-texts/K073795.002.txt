THE DUKE OF LEEDS  O these flaws and starts would well become  A woman's story at a winter's fire  Authoriz'd by her grandam  Shakespeare's Macheth  VOL II  LONDON PRINTED FOR AND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF GEORGE CAWTHORN BRITISH LIBRARY STRAND    TALE THE EIGHTH  THE  FORCE OF FRIENDSHIP  OR THE TALE OF MULEYZEYDAN  ADDRESSED TO  THEODORE MAURICE ESQ  ADDRESS TO  THEODORE MAURICE ESQ  DORUS the present lay is thine  The tale to Friendship I consign  To thee who well dost comprehend  The zeal and fervour of a friend  Thou who hast known my infant Muse  Since first she could her gocart use  This  plaything  candidly receive  And smile and censure and forgive  How oft doth memory enjoy  The sports that did our days employ  When gentle HOTCHKIS  UpperMaster of the CharterhouseSchool when the Author was a Student there  held the rule  O'er SUTTON's longrenowned school  THOMAS SUTTON Esq Founder of the Charterhouse  Some age ago whose annals shone  With deathless STEELE and ADDISON  And in our days from BLACKSTONE's  The late eminent Judge BLACKSTONE  name  Have gather'd dignity and fame  For many a trick and many a feat  I love the rev'rend bound'ry yet  And can ev'n now in thought run o'er  The gambols I enjoy'd before  I love it for the lore I gain'd  For all that pleas'd and all that pain'd  For tasks of each denomination  Theme verse night study and translation  Nay to this hour when I engage  With HORACE's or VIRGIL's page  Right mindful I my tribute pay  Of gratitude to  Founder's Day  The  Carthusian building  so called because it was originally a Convent of Carthusian Monks  But chief I love the antique walls  For that each wellknown path recalls  The basis of our friendship laid  Which hath for years stood undecay'd  What tho' awhile th' Atlantic ran  With envious course 'twixt man and man  No time no distance could unbind  The sacred league 'twixt mind and mind  Long may we hail with honest mirth  The place which gave our friendship birth  And in libation to the school  When chatting o'er a social bowl  Through life it seemly may become us  To toast CARTHUSIANA DOMUS  The th of December set apart as a yearly festival in honour of the Founder  THE TALE OF  MULEYZEYDAN  This Tale is founded on an event in the reign of LOUIS XIV of France during a war wherein the Algerines refused to exchange prisoners with him  HIGH on the rampart MULEYZEYDAN stood  Where the broad main Algiers' strong tow'rs o'erlook  Pond'ring awhile with fixed eye the flood  Then to his son his painful silence broke  II  Thou seest my boy yon tall and garish fleet  How proud their streamers flaunt it to the air  There Gallic chiefs in warlike councils meet  And to assail these rugged walls prepare  III  What does their master royal LOUIS claim  Only to set war's wretched captives free  By cartel to conclude the date of shame  And give the valiant air and liberty  IV  The bloody bus'ness of the battle o'er  The clarion mute the falchion thrown aside  The loss of freedom why should they deplore  And saucy taunts of servile guards abide  V  Why daily pore with dim desponding eye  On the worn flint or dampimpaired wall  Or thro' the chink one scanty gleam descry  Of cheering light which God gave free to all  VI  "The bloody bus'ness of the battle o'er"  Each party should accord a full release  Each captivemourner to his friends restore  And with the slaughter bid his suff'rings cease  VII  Yet this our DEY severe of soul denies  His hands refuse to loose the galling chain  But keep th'imprison'd brave to vent their sighs  Far from their home unpitied and in vain  VIII  Nay morehis unrelenting heart commands  What reason manhood tremble but to hear  Soon as the Gallic fleet her ports expands  And with their fatal thunders fills the air  IX  Before each cannon which our tow'rs desends  A captive Frenchman pinion'd shall be plac'd  Thence to be  render'd  to their Christian friends  Or stain with mangled limbs the wat'ry waste  X  And must CHOISEUL the virtuous and the brave  Enrich'd with ev'ry elegance of mind  Among the groupe an undistinguish'd slave  To such a barb'rous sentence be consign'd  XI  CHOISEULwho when I lay as now doth he  An helpless captive to the chance of war  No means to soften my calamity  From thy dear mother's care removed far  XII  CHOISEUL beheld me with compassion's eye  He hasten'd to relieve a stranger's woes  To Nature's ev'ry craving dealt supply  And taught my throbbing heart to feel repose  XIII  When sickness bound me to a restless bed  CHOISEUL's assiduous hand was ever near  At closing night he bound my aching head  And watch'd my wakings with a brother's care  XIV  And shall this man of matchless virtue  sink  To rancour and barbarity a prey  Nolet me snatch him from destruction's  brink  By supplication to our rigid DEY  XV  See where he stands on yonder turret's height  To give the signal for his own decree  And lo indignant frowning at his fate  CHOISEUL first brought for horrid destiny  XVI  "Swift let me fly"before the obdurate chief  Prostrate he plung'd"O spare him spare my friend  "Regard these tears this agony of grief  "And at thy vet'ran's suit his fate suspend  XVII  "Have not we been in war together rear'd  "Ere since our arms a scymitar could wield  "Then by the toils the dangers we have shar'd  "In  watchful  councils and th'ensanguin'd field  XVIII  "Kneeling I thus implore thee grant the life  "Of brave CHOISEUL call back that dreadful morn  "When struggling in the battle's hottest strife  "And by the tide of conquest overborne  XIX  "Thy fav'rite son was rescued by this hand  "From the gigantic Moor's descending sword  "Didst thou not then to whatsoe'er demand  "I might exact accord thy plighted word  XX  "Ne'er did I 'vail me of that service done  "Ne'er ne'er till now for retribution bend  "Then do not pause but grant thy warrior's boon  "Regard thy plighted word and save my friend"  XXI  Fierce from the swelling eyeball of the DEY  Shot forth indignant sparks of hottest ire  As 'twixt the clouds red meteors force their way  And fill the firmament with gleams of fire  XXII  "Is it  too much  to grant this  pious  grace  "One only boon is left me then to ask  "Bind bind  me  to him in a close embrace  "And bid the cannoneer perform his task  XXIII  "See at the fatal point my friend they place  "Best of the good the bravest of the brave  "Thus thus I clasp him in this last embrace  "And perish with the man I could not save"  XXIV  The DEY abhors to give the cruel sign  Down to the platform rushing he descends  Mild drops of mercy on his visage shine  As with amazement he surveys the  friends  XXV  "What sense is this" the alter'd man exclaims  "What warmth unfelt till now pervades my heart  "The wondrous ardour which your souls inflames  "To me its sudden influence doth impart  XXVI  "Untwine that churlish misbeseeming cord  "Live for each other long and happy live  "The mutual transport which I thus afford  "Not to  my promise  but  thy worth  I give  XXVII  "Ye Gallic chiefs take ransomeless the rest  "Bid your bold prows exulting cleave the wave  "The FORCE OF FRIENDSHIP this barbarian breast  "Hath taught to  feel  to  pity  and to  save"  TALE THE NINTH  MUTUAL SELFREPROOF OR THE  TALE OF CADWAL  IN TWO PARTS  The candid mind by acknowledging and discarding its faults has reason and truth for the foundation of all its passions and desires and consequently is happy  SPECTATOR  INTRODUCTION  WHATshall the Muse in labour'd rhymes  Retrace events of former times  And shall no duteous verse attend  On  him  who was my  earliest friend  Forbid it ev'ry feeling good  Obedience love and gratitude  Remembrance bears his image strong  And perfect as when life was young  His image rough his mien austere  His heart kind tender and sincere  Ev'n now he seems to meet my sight  And fancy trembles with delight  Oft when at eve I trace the glade  My mind pourtrays him in the shade  And oft benignant smiles he beams  Presiding o'er my midnight dreams  Still SIRE BELOV'D my fancy fill  Exert thine influence o'er me still  Still through my soul thy virtues stream  And mingle with life's latest dream  Till wing'd for yon aetherial plain  I seek thy lov'd embrace again  THE TALE OF  CADWAL  PART I  I  DARK December was the month  The air was dank and chill  When CADWAL's weary foot had reach'd  The summit of the hill  II  Beneath whose ample verge he wont  To labour at the plough  And to relieve his father's age  Bedew his infant brow  III  When eighteen years had o'er him pass'd  He left his rustic home  Soresmote with grief in distant grounds  And strangerfields to roam  IV  Twelve winters had his exile seen  When lo his bosom burns  Again to clasp his father's knees  And homeward he returns  V  And now descending to the vale  With slow and trembling feet  Reviewing this his native soil  The pulses flutt'ring beat  VI  And now with penetrating eye  He pierces the close dell  Where in his thatchbeshelter'd cot  His Sire did whilom dwell  VII  Yet in his sad and troubled look  Such terror might ye see  As when we almost wish to shun  The thing we wish should be  VIII  He pryed here he pryed there  No cottage could he spy  Nor smallest trace of human tread  Appeared to his eye  IX  No monarch of the feather'd brood  Was heard aloud to crow  Nor laboured ox the vocal air  Awaken with his low  X  In strange amazement and suspense  Awhile benumb'd he stood  Then fell despairing on the earth  And wept and wail'd aloud  XI  His piercing cries an hermit drew  Forth from his lonely cell  Whose pliant sense was quick to feel  Affliction's poignant yell  XII  Compassion held him mute at first  While as he ponder'd him  With fixed eye where nature's floods  Upswelled to the brim  XIII  Then thus"My son your plaints I heard  "They smote me to the heart  "To me without reserve or fear  "The weighty cause impart  XIV  "Deepvers'd in sorrow's plaintive task  "Full many a weary hour  "Right well I know what aggravates  "And what abates its pow'r  XV  "Closepent within restraining bounds  "The river foams and roars  "Tumultuous boils with mighty heaves  "And wounds its kindred shores  XVI  "The load remov'd that choak'd its course  "The violence subsides  "The tumult lessens by degrees  "And smooth the current glides  XVII  "Give then the struggling griefs to flow  "Which thy clogg'd heart oppress  "Each word will take a part away  "And make the burthen less"  XVIII  'Old CADWAL here distraught I seek  'Here CADWAL dwelt of yore  'Here here his quiet cottage rose  'But now is here no more'  XIX  "Old CADWAL seek'st thou Hapless man  "New torments must thou have  "Beneath this venerable elm  "Behold the rustic's grave"  XX  'Oh wretch accurs  d I was the cause  'I 'reft him of his breath  'I robb'd these fields of CADWAL's worth  'I brought him to his death  XXI  'Was he not to his various kin  'Unworthy I alone  'Was he not guardian comforter  'Friend father all in one  XXII  'What honest hind that near him toil'd  'But of his store partook  'Was he not to the needy swain  'As to the mead the brook  XXIII  'Did he not deal to all around  'His smile as well as care  'Not ev'n the sparrow of the hedge  'But in his love had share  XXIV  'And wretch accurs'd I was the cause  'I 'reft him of his breath  'I robb'd these fields of CADWAL's worth  'I brought him to his death'  XXV  "Too rigidly perchance my son  "Thyself thou dost accuse  "And heapest on thy burthen'd heart  "Unnecessary woes  XXVI  "Ah how severe the punishment  "When we ourselves arraign  "And hatred oft and malice 'self  "Inflict a milder pain  XXVII  "Less harshly censure thy offence  "Some youthful warmth I ween  "And give it to mine ear in terms  "Soft candid and serene  XXVIII  "Here on this bank repose awhile  "And bid these tumults cease  "With thine I'll mix my social tears  "And sooth returning peace"  XXIX  'Ah father this thine holy love  'Embitters what I feel  'Unwittingly thou add'st a sting  'To sorrows thou would'st heal  XXX  'Here on this bank what precious hours  'I've known in days of youth  'List'ning the precepts that he gave  'Of wisdom and of truth  XXXI  'Here in the sweetlytranquil eve  'Day's rugged labour done  'He'd tell how good and glorious men  'Life's arduous race had run  XXXII  'What tides of blood had wash'd these lands  'Which we in peace had till'd  'And how the faithful rustic once  'Great ALFRED here conceal'd  XXXIII  'But oh my griefbewilder'd mind  'From reason wanders far  'And with vague fancies idly mocks  'Thy kind thy pious care'  XXXIV  "Heed not my sonuse any means  "That may assuage thy pain  "It is the privilege of woe  "At random to complain  XXXV  "And who of patient sympathy  "The lib'ral largess scant  "Withhold a bounty great I ween  "As Wealth can show'r on Want  PART II  I  'OLD CADWAL here distraught I seek  'Ah me this wayward heart  'That dar'd oppose a father's pow'r  'That dar'd his counsel thwart  II  'But EMMA's charms had won my love  'And made it all her own  'I sought not copious flocks and meads  'I sought Content alone  III  'And oh so sweetly she conform'd  'To all I wish'd or said  'You would have sworn our hearts as twins  'Were for each other made  IV  'And was it holy father say  'Was it a crime to love  'Or to my earlyplighted vows  'Unchang'd and steady prove  V  'MATILDA'S lofty friends in store  'Of riches did abound  'And ample sheaves enrich'd their meads  'And orchards rose around  VI  'And those possessions ev'ry hour  'Were pour'd into mine ear  'To count them o'er my father made  'His morn and ev'ning care  VII  'Sure if he any sailing had  'Twas too fond love for me  'Hence sprang the wish that of her fields  'I should the master be  VIII  'And as he wish'd and as he bade  'O that I could have done  'But EMMA'S charms had won my love  'And made it all her own  IX  'Say father ought I in the church  'Have join'd MATILDA'S hand  'When love and truth that should attend  'Were not at my command  X  'Her spacious granariesto me  'They no allurement were  'My EMMA's lowroof'd dairyhut  'To me was dearer far  XI  'Why after large possessions seek  'My father knew no want  'Of copious tributes from the field  'His barns were nothing scant  XII  'But 'twas his willand oh that I  'That will could have obey'd  'Without the guilt of broken vows  'Or EMMA's peace betray'd  XIII  'Now that my frowardness of heart  'Hath brought him to his end  'For this beside yon hallow'd sod  'In duteous wise I'll bend  XIV  'For this will daily wet the turf  'With my repentant eye  'Nor ever from this solitude  'To fairer refuge fly'  XV  "Son" quoth the sage and cast a look  As chill'd the youth all o'er  While minutes past ere vital warmth  His senses did restore  XVI  "Son" quoth the sage "thy doubts suspend  "Their swelling tumults check  "It is thy father clasps thee thus  "And weeps upon thy neck  XVII  "Long have I held thee in discourse  "With pentup agony  "Now let my gushing tears have way  "They're blessings shower'd on thee  XVIII  "Charm'd with thy duteous excellence  "Thy strength of filial love  "My full forgiveness let these streams  "And warm embraces prove  XIX  "And oh can'st thou forgive the cause  "That drove thee from thy home  "Soresmote with grief in distant grounds  "And strangerfields to roam"  XX  'Can I forgiveOh father such  'Unseemly terms restrain  'Can I forgiveIt is enough  'I see thee once again  XXI  'But said'st thou not beneath yon elm'  "My dearest son I did  "There have I mark'd my chosen spot  "There made my latest bed  XXII  "Of thee berest what booted it  "To tend the furrow'd plain  "Or what from Autumn's fruitful lap  "To heap the ripen'd grain  XXIII  "Whom had I then to cheer my steps  "In Summer's sultry rays  "For whom should then the social hearth  "In winterev'ning blaze  XXIV  "My house my barns I left at large  "To moulder and decay  "Yon humble tenement I rais'd  "My age's only stay  XXV  "Enough for me who meant forlorn  "To pass life's dragging eve  "My task to meditate and pray  "My punishment to grieve  XXVI  "For oh my son too late I felt  "This truth within my heart  "That to compel the filial mind  "Is not a parent's part  XXVII  "And hence this penitential garb  "And hence these silver hairs  "Whose hoary length the sad recluse  "Or pensive hermit wears  XXVIII  'Dear honour'd father droop no more  'Thus on my bended knee  'I crave I claimrenounce thy griefs  'Cast cast them all on me  XXIX  'With

my homely hut she dwells  "My age's comfort she  XXXIV  "Her father dead I fill'd his place  "The guardian of her youth  "I now restore her to thy love  "Thy wishes and thy truth"  XXXV  Young CADWAL waited not for more  But to his EMMA flew  Wherc lock'd awhile in close embrace  Each to the other grew  XXXVI  From incoherent words and sighs  Such wondrous transports brake  Far more than honey'd Eloquence  With all her tongues could speak  XXXVII  And now with strong enquiring look  They search each other's eye  To ask if what they see be true  And doubt the real joy  XXXVIII  Anon the father's quick'ning steps  They greet with bended grace  And with uplifted eyes adore  And bless his rev'rend face  XXXIX  "Now by this hallow'd Eve I vow  Probably  ChristmasEve  as  December  is the

having been through mistake forgotten to be mentioned in the Preface it is proper to do it now It was printed many years ago in a Collection of Letters but was read by so few at that time that the Author has been induced to make it part of this Publication  TALE THE TENTH  RETRIBUTION OR THE  TALE OF DURAND  Blessed is he who considereth the Poor and Needy  PSALMS  ADDRESS TO  MRS B  CHARLOTTE to thee whose gentle breast  Of innate goodness is possest  To thee a friendly Muse appeals  For truth of what her Tale reveals  From  Gallia's  once delightful shore  Thy Sire  The late John Rich Esq Patentee of the Theatre Royal Covent Garden  the sacred  symbol  bore  And oft exulted to expand  The test of an Almighty hand  The wondrous test of bounty giv'n  To humble worth by fav'ring Heav'n  Thy Sire the wellremember'd name  Lays on the Muse a sacred claim  To speak his fascinating pow'r  Who wak'd to glee the scenic hour  The private walk of life endear'd  And many an aching bosom cheer'd  Who liv'd applauded and approv'd  And died regretted and belov'd  This thy dear parent's wellearn'd praise  Deserves the mead of richer lays  Here might the Muse with volant quill  From COWLEY  COWLEY near Uxbridge the seat of the late Mr RICH  pass to sweet  RoseHill  Rose Hill at Hampton in Middlesex the name of Mr BEARD's Villa  With Mem'ry take a random flight  Whirl'd in delirium of delight  Dwell on the name of JOHNNY BEARD  The  friend  who ev'ry spot endear'd  Recording the familiar chat  Oft "here he stray'd" and "there he sate"  Or all beneath yon aged oak  He twirl'd the pun or coin'd the joke  Or lengthen'd out the ev'ning walk  On subjects grave in moral talk  Or cheerly wak'd the rosy morn  With chaunting clear his  early horn  Of more exalted worth the Muse would speak  But needless were the task and words too weak  For his innate benevolence of soul  Fond to dispense the  charitable dole  That energy wherewith he sought the haunt  Of crippled age of malady or want  Mr BEARD might with great propriety and truth have adopted the phrase which that ingenious writer Mr CUMBERLAND has put into the mouth of  Sheva  in his Comedy of the  Jew  "I do not  ta  k  of charity I  feel  it"  And all the virtues which the Muse could find  Lodg'd in the casket of his  consort's  mind  Which scarce a MASON's pen could amply grace  Will be recorded in a  better place  THE TALE OF  DURAND  WITHIN the placid  Isle of France  The  Isle of France  is that peculiar Province wherein the city of  Paris  stands and obtained the name of an  Island  from its situation which lies between the rivers  Seine Marne Oise  and  Aisne  The soil is in general remarkably fertile  Scene once of taste and elegance  When  Paris  from her regal bound  Gave fashions to a world around  DURAND resided frugal swain  And cultur'd his paternal plain  With daily care he dress'd the land  And earn'd his food from Nature's hand  Contented with his humble state  He envy'd not the rich or great  Each morn he rose with decent pride  His comfortable roof he eyed  The garden's growth survey'd with care  Admir'd each useful product there  Now trac'd with an enamour'd look  The sweetlywinding limpid brook  Mark'd where his fertile meads extended  By woods from eastern blasts defended  Then on his grateful knees would fall  And thank the bounteous LORD OF ALL  In his plain heart much room had he  For well plac'd liberality  Bounteous not lavish of his pelf  He lov'd his neighbour as himself  But at distress or hunger's call  He shew'd himself a friend to all  With daily toil his ground he till'd  With constant care each season fill'd  From his own hand each eve he fed  The labour'd ox and weary steed  And with endearing touch approv'd  The labours of the beast he lov'd  JEAN shar'd the drudg'ry of the field  MANON domestic duties fill'd  Dear children of a dearer wife  The gentle sweetners of his life  To Matins and to Vespers true  They paid their Maker homage due  On Sabbathdays with fervent mind  The public worship constant join'd  And in the ev'ning sports were seen  To join the dance upon the green  Such was the custom such the lore  Parisians  us'd in days of yore  But decent pastimes now are done  Rule order nay religion gone  The very name of Sabbath flown  And  Decads  count their time alone  But I digressthe good DURAND  Rich in the tribute of his land  As all the neighb'ring farmers were  Who dwell'd within that Province fair  With honest pride rejoic'd to see  The produce of his industry  One year unwonted in that Isle  Incessant rains oppress'd the soil  The seed ev'n perish'd in its birth  And Nature own'd a general dearth  AVARE with wealth and pride o'ergrown  Who knew no interest but his own  Who never sought the dreary shed  Where Want reclin'd his aching head  Who could rebuke with ruthless low'r  The famish'd stranger from his door  Beheld the dearth with joyous look  And thus the neighb'ring swains bespoke  "Now is the time for us my friends  "To use our stores for wisest ends  "'Tis our's the price to regulate  "And fix it at the highest rate  "Fools only such occasions lose  "And Fortune's proffer'd means a buse  "The thrifty are the truly wise  "Who watch each change with wary eyes  "Each distant means of gain discern  And to their own advantage turn"  DURAND heard all but homeward sped  With musing gait and downcast head  And at the closing hour of rest  The great Creator thus address'd  "Father of All who know'st my heart  "Search and correct each sinful part  "Ne'er may illegal thirst of gain  "Or sordid craft my bosom stain  "If e'er accumulated store  "Make me 'gainst Mis'ry close my door  "For worthier beings oh reserve  "The blessings I should ill deserve  "Of means to succour while possess'd  "If rigour steel my callous breast  "Let me the want I slight endure  "And make me poorest of the poor  "But now while scarcity prevails  "And Nature's wonted bounty fails  "Ought I from treasur'd hoards refuse  "A mod'rate share for general use  "Or added profit dare to grind  "From the afflictions of mankind  "Nowhat thy bounty heap'd on me  "To others I'll distribute free  "And if I act as I profess  "May'st thou the resolution bless"  He spoke and felt the dew of sleep  In soft repose his senses steep  In blissful dreams he pass'd the night  And cheerly hail'd returning light  But cold and dreary look'd the ground  A melancholy blank around  Instead of Autumn's golden grain  A barren Winter seem'd to reign  DURAND beheld his neighbourband  For small supplies make high demand  Yet sanctimoniously he kept  The promise plighted ere he slept  With scorn the profit he declin'd  Wrung "from the affliction of mankind"  At easy rates his grain he shar'd  Nay something to the needy spar'd  Thus in relieving others bless'd  Smil'd and enjoy'd unbroken rest  But mark what miracles appear  To signalize th' ensuing year  Let not the doubting or the bold  Deride the wonders I unfold  For lips that never knew deceit  To me the story did repeat  And made each heart with pleasure thrill  In sweet discoursings at  RoseHill  Th' ensuing Autumn saw the ground  In grain of ev'ry kind abound  Each husbandman with joy beheld  The swelling product of his field  But chief DURANDbefore whose view  Scarce crediting the vision true  Each rising stem was seen to bear  Replete with grain a TRIPLE ear  This was the symbol alluded to in the Address Mr RICH was not only an eye witness to this wonderful production in its state of vegetation but likewise brought several of them to England and shewed them to all his visitors  And none save  his  prolific field  So plenteous a display did yield  The marvel quickly gather'd fame  From distant quarters numbers came  All gaz'd with wonder some with spite  Some with extravagant delight  Tend'ring a gratulating hand  To the lov'd owner of the land  DURAND the merciful and good  In silence breath'd his gratitude  AVARE who mingled in the crowd  Astounded stoodthen thus aloud  "Oft have I dar'd in accents rude  "Deny th' existence of a GOD  "Too oft absurdly dar'd advance  "That  all is the effect of Chance  "But wonders such as  here  are shewn  "Must spring from  Pow'r Divine  alone  TALE THE ELEVENTH  THE TEST OF LOVE OR THE TALE OF  EDWARD AND ORRA  ADDRESS TO  W WILBERFORCE ESQ M P  I  To thee  muchhonour'd  WILBERFORCE  A strangerMuse her tribute pays  And aims thy merits to record  In weak but welldirected praise  II  To thee of right the Tale belongs  Whose pitying heart partakes the pain  Of wretches who in distant lands  Are gall'd with Slav'ry's rankling chain  III  On thy persuasive choice of words  And the mild accents of thy tongue  With mute attention and delight  Oft hath a British Senate hung  IV  To pity woes which we have felt  A  partial  virtue only proves  And he who serves a friend distress'd  But mitigates the heart he loves  V  But who compassionates the fate  Of suff'rers whom he ne'er hath known  This  universal  love displays  This WILBERFORCE is all thine own  VI  Oh had I but the pow'r of verse  Might with a MASON's talents vie  Thy firm disinterested zeal  Oh MISERY's FRIEND should never die  INTRODUCTION  I  THY favours Nature goddess dear  Are not to place or sphere confin'd  To shape complexion or degree  They're dealt at large among mankind  II  Whate'er in station title dress  Bright and respectable we find  Nature the brilliant polish gives  That graces and exalts the mind  III  COLIN by birth decreed to share  The servile labours of the field  Or watch beneath the milker's hand  His herds their steaming fullness yield  IV  When by his few selected friends  Encircled at his homely board  Display'd an elegance of mind  That might have grac'd the proudsst lord  V  COLIN had gracious been and mild  Tho' born o'er Tartars rude to reign  And GEORGE been pious great and good  Tho' born an humble village swain  VI  The attributes to regal sway  A cold obedience may invite  But 'tis the  goodness of his heart  That to obedience adds delight  VII  Natives of  Europe  wherefore boast  The fair complexion of a skin  'Tis not how climates act without  But how great Nature works within  VIII  The beauteous tint which she displays  Engages Wisdom's sober eye  Beyond the fairest outward form  That blooms beneath our milder sky  IX  Nay Love itself hath shone as bright  As pure as tender and as true  Beneath an  Afric's  sable breast  As ever  British  bosom knew  X  How hearts of  Moorish  climes have lov'd  How long how constant and how well  Let EDWARD's and his ORRA's Tale  In plain and simple numbers tell  THE TALE OF  EDWARD AND ORRA  All the principal events whereon this Tale is founded occurred in a private family in the City of London and that so recently as about the middle of the present century  PART I  I  WITHIN  Angola's  regal bounds  On  Afric's  wild and sultry waste  Were JUBA and his ORRA born  And life's brief morn together pass'd  II  Yet on that drear uncultur'd soil  Nature their tender minds impress'd  With early sense of right and wrong  And pour'd her softness o'er each breast  III  Or ere ten years had crown'd their youth  From kin and country were they torn  For sordid ore to slav'ry sold  To strange and diff'rent climates borne  IV  Mates in their infant sports they griev'd  When sunder'd from each other's side  And with their tears a farewel took  As either vessel cut the tide  V  She by the master of her fate  Was landed on  Barbado  s'  Isle  There to a wealthy merchant sold  'Mid groups of fellowslaves to toil  VI  And many a heavy hour she pass'd  As o'er her painful task she hung  And sometimes thought of JUBA lost  And now she wept and now she sung  VII  The music of her plaintive voice  Attracted ev'ry list'ning ear  And her demeanour meek and kind  To each good heart made ORRA dear  VIII  But chief her younger mistress' breast  Her ditties wild to pity mov'd  As through the circuit of the grounds  The gentle ANNA daily rov'd  IX  Some three years more advanc'd in age  Oft would the  British Maiden  stray  Where patient ORRA ply'd her task  To listen to her artless lay  X  At her request the  tender Moor  Was from the field of labour led  From scorching suns and rulers harsh  And to domestic duties bred  XI  Here all she was prescrib'd to learn  With docile cheerfulness attain'd  Unconscious of her own desert  She daily praise and favour gain'd  XII  And when her ev'ning task was o'er  Ofttime would ANNA soothe her forth  To wander in the cedargrove  And learn the story of her birth  XIII  As oft in tears would ORRA tell  Of parents to her heart scarce known  Who sent her into stranger lands  Unbless'd unfriended and alone  XIV  Hence an attachment mutual grew  Nor could a sister's love be more  Than ANNA's susceptible heart  To poor deserted ORRA bore  XV  Here ORRA found a better home  For many a rising happy year  Dear to the equals of her state  Nor less to her superiors dear  XVI  And here fidelity and love  Attach'd and lengthen'd ORRA's stay  Until with mingled smiles and tears  She witness'd ANNA's bridal day  PART II  I  MEANTIME the ship which JUBA bore  To mild  Virginia's  harbour sail'd  There a new master JUBA own'd  Whose desp'rate schemes in traffic fail'd  II  Whether 'twere ign'rance or neglect  Or dissipation thinn'd his gold  But all his hopes were scatter'd wide  Slaves lands and buildings all were sold  III  When for integrity renown'd  And sense above his servile sphere  JUBA so Fate ordain'd allur'd  The notice of the British Peer  IV  Who then by equitable laws  Virginia's  rich plantation sway'd  And in his lord's esteem and love  A daily progress JUBA made  V  For in all knowledge that became  His station an adept he grew  True to the talents Nature lent  And to his master's interest true  VI  Approv'd instructed and belov'd  An easy servitude he wore  And by his lord was still retain'd  When home recall'd to  Britain's  shore  VII  The Peer right noble by descent  But nobler in a gen'rous mind  Lamenting that a virtuous heart  Should be in slavish bonds confin'd  VIII  When settled in his native land  His faithful JUBA thus address'd  Who in his master's cital kneel'd  With sore dismay and doubt oppress'd  IX  "Rise faithful man no longer sigh  "Beneath base Slav'ry's grievous thrall  "Here in this happy land enjoy  "That dow'r our laws afford to all  X  "Henceforth be free  Religion's  hand  "Shall seal thee with a mark divine  "That done thine own assenting will  "And that alone can make thee mine"  XI  He led him to the  sacred font  With newenkindled hopes inflam'd  The holy rituals were perform'd  And JUBA now is EDWARD nam'd  XII  With pride he to his Lord's abode  Return'd and with redoubled zeal  He strove by actions to express  What words were powerless to reveal  XIII  Oft he essay'd in vain to speak  The love and duty of his breast  As oft convulsive sobs and tears  With swelling throes his voice suppress'd  XIV  His  Lord  the painful strugglings felt  Fraught with intelligence refin'd  With smile complacent sooth'd his pain  And in his silence read his mind  XV  First fav'rite in his master's train  Some years in comfort EDWARD liv'd  Nor felt a pain but when his heart  For ORRA's dubious fortune griev'd  XVI  Nor did good EDWARD e'er forget  He wore a  Christian's  sacred sign  But duly sought the  House of Pray'r  And worshipp'd at the  Holy Shrine  PART III  I  TIME that unravels every doubt  Time that allays the keenest smart  That wondrous mysteries unfolds  To vex or please the human heart  II  At this blest prime of EDWARD's youth  Wrought forth a singular event  A sweet return for EDWARD's worth  As by his better angel sent  III  For now unwieldy grown in wealth  Fair ANNA's  parents  strongly yearn  To barter their  Barbadian  lands  And to their native clime return  IV  The lands are sold at mighty price  And now for  England  they prepare  With ORRA in their train to lend  The infant family her care  V  Four daughters now her mistress own'd  Whom ORRA's fond attention rear'd  But none to ORRA's tender heart  Like lovely ANNA was endear'd  VI  Arriv'd in safety they select  A dwelling fit for upstart pride  Hence in contiguous mansions plac'd  EDWARD and ORRA now reside  VII  When bliss to worthy hearts is dealt  Some call it  Fortune's  casual dow'r  Forgive the Muse if she ascribes  Such bliss to a  superior  Pow'r  VIII  EDWARD at sound of ORRA's name  Yearns to engage in converse sweet  When soon comparing past events  Their hearts with mutual rapture beat  IX  Their infant moments they recount  Their separation on the main  And EDWARD pours a show'r of tears  On his dear  playmate  found again  X  No wonder such an early bent  Should to maturer passion rise  They felt alike the kindling flame  And read it in each other's eyes  XI  They plighted love they plighted troth  He vow'd to live for her alone  And soon as fit occasion serv'd  Connubial rites should make them one  XII  But 'midst these secret hours of bliss  A sudden grief smote EDWARD's heart  His  Lord  a rapid fever seiz'd  That baffled medicinal art  XIII  Retir'd to taste his villa's sweets  A blast of noxious ev'ning wind  Convey'd a poison to his veins  And wrought insanity of mind  XIV  Swift to the villa EDWARD flew  He left awhile his ORRA dear  Strong gratitude impell'd his heart  To make his  Lord  his only care  XV  And she with patient smile approv'd  And yielded to the sacred claim  Which bounty lays on gen'rous minds  For ORRA's bosom felt the same  XVI  O could it be that in the hours  To pious offices assign'd  When EDWARD with unceasing care  And with a soreafflicted mind  XVII  Watch'd ev'ry breath his master drew  Felt ev'ry groan that smote his ear  And for returning sense and health  Made ev'ry thought a fervent pray'r  XVIII  In such a season could it be  That ANNA's cruel  parents  strove  By sordid treach'ry to divide  Poor ORRA from her EDWARD's love  XIX  It wasO passion sprung from hell  Unmitigable thirst of gold  To what base deeds dost thou impell  The bosom that's by thee controll'd  XX  Thus ruminated ANNA's  Sire  "Should EDWARD take this ORRA's hand  "Conduct her to the altar's foot  "And once be join'd in nuptial band  XXI  "No remedy were left for me  "A  Christian  made my slave is lost  "A  Christian  's  wife  with him she goes  "And with her all the gold she cost  XXII  "It shall not bethis very hour  "A vessel in the river rides  "Bound straight for  Carolina  's bay  "And only waits for fav'ring tides  XXIII  "Her husband ITomorrow's sun  "Shall be the last of ORRA's stay  "For at the approaching midnight hour  "Shall she be sudden borne away  XXIV  A  man  perchance to gain devote  For ORRA's fate might little grieve  But that his  wife  should yield assent  What gentle female will believe  XXV  Tho' pearly drops from ORRA's eyes  Adown her jetty bosom fell  While in convulsive sobs she cry'd  "O let me bid him one farewel"  XXVI  Yet all was vainnot ORRA's pray'rs  Her years of faithful service spent  Nor lovely ANNA's fond request  Could make the mother's heart relent  XXVII  No rot th' assembled  childrens'  tears  Whom ORRA's tender care had rear'd  Could draw one drop of pity down  'Gainst all her callous breast was sear'd  XXVIII  The word was pass'dthe morrow's sun  Was doom'd the last of ORRA's stay  And at th' ensuing midnight hour  Was faithful ORRA torne away  PART IV  I  Now by his suff'ring master's bed  Some fourteen wretched days had pass'd  Which EDWARD spent in ceaseless moan  Nor left him till he breath'd his last  II  Nor left him  then  but join'd the rites  That laid him in his peaceful home  And bending o'er the coffin'd clay  Shed grateful sorrows in the tomb  III  But what was now his wild surprise  On learning that his Lord's regard  Had for his faithful services  Bequeath'd an annual rich reward  IV  One hundred annual poundshow blest  Might now this worthy couple prove  From slav'ry ORRA might be freed  Or bound alone to him and love  V  Swift to the wonted haunt he flew  To pour the news in ORRA's ear  But like a statue breathless stood  When told  "Your  ORRA is not here  VI  "Ungratefully she left the house  "Where she had foster'd been so long"  He groan'dhe stamp'dhe rent his hair  But mute and motionless his tongue  VII  At length a bursting flood of tears  Gave ease to his o'erloaded breast  And just supplied sufficient strength  Of words to make one short request  VIII  "Where  is she gone"No answer came  To silence all the train were sworn  To keep closelock'd from EDWARD's ear  When how or whither she was borne  IX  But ANNA who lamented sore  Her ORRA thus by craft betray'd  Wrote  "Carolina"  on a card  And to his hands by stealth convey'd  X  He sought and soon a passage gain'd  He saw with joy the streamers spread  And daily chid the loit'ring waves  That all so slow the vessel sped  XI  At length the wish'dfor port is gain'd  He searches each plantation round  Nor till some eight long days are pass'd  Can ORRA's sad resort be found  XII  His eyes discover her at last  Beneath the toil of noontide suns  He folds her in one short embrace  Then to the  Planter  eager runs  XIII  Prostrate upon the ground he falls  Now at his feet submissive kneels  In plaintive terms and broken sighs  His own and ORRA's tale reveals  XIV  Then thus "O give my ORRA back  "Give me my first my only love  "All all the treasure I command  "Would little for her ransom prove  XV  "Or if inhuman you refuse  "This my fond bosom's ardent pray'r  "Receive me in your fields at least  "And let me ORRA'S slav'ry share  XVI  "Again to bondage will I bend  "Again embrace the galling chain  "Let me but toil by ORRA'S side  "I will not murmur or complain"  XVII  This Planter  own'd a noble heart  He rais'd the suppliant with a tear  Then made a kind inviting sign  To ORRA who stood weeping near  XVIII  "The longlov'd fav'rite of thy breast  "From this a stranger's hand receive  "A greater pleasure is not thine  "Than mine in having pow'r to give  XIX  "Unransom'd take her to thy arms  "Nor offer me thy treasur'd ore  "This transport is more wealth to me  "Than either Indies' boasted store"  TALE THE TWELFTH  CHEDDER CLIFTS OR  RAYMOND  ADDRESSED TO  MARIA  Timor minae  Scandunt eodem quo Dominus neque  Decedit aerata triremi  Post equitem sedet atra cura

sweets of Nature shoot around  The modest orchard spreads its pregnant bough  And the ripe apple bends it to the ground  VI  Rich bev'rage yielding to the needy hind  That holds his dwelling in yon claybuilt cot  Who with the treasure of a blameless mind  Adoring GOD abides his lowly lot  VII  The soaming flood which some few minutes past  Roll'd with impetuous course its tide along  Now

And bleat responsive from the echoing rocks  X  Here view the shatter'd carcass of a hare  And list the hoaryheaded peasant's tale  How from the summit's ridge impell'd by fear  Of the fell hounds she plung'd into the vale  XI  And with compassion view the various scars  Which deep indent the honest rustic's face  Nor wonder that with recollected fears  He trembling points to yon tremendous place  XII  Yon rugged brow whence once returning home  'Mid the thickrising vapours of the night  He miss'd his footpath in the treach'rous gloom  And headlong fell from the stupendous height  XIII  Fell

his excellent natural endowments and philanthropic virtues but more generally known to the world by the share he had in the elegant Letters of  Henry and Frances  and many other ingenious publications  pour'd into my list'ning ear  What time we stray'd thro'  Twick'nham  's flow'ry vale  HENRY lamented ever ever dear  XXII  HENRY whose friendship I in youth obtain'd  When Fortune led me to  Hibernia  's shore  From whom full many a moral truth I glean'd  In sweet excursions on the banks of  Nore  Nore  the river which runs through the County of  Kilkenny  THE TALE OF  RAYMOND  The  name  of the country wherein the very singular transactions occurred on which this tale is founded is for obvious reasons concealed The Author presumed therefore he was at liberty to lay the scene wherever his fancy suggested Having while he was projecting his composition visited that stupendous chasm in  Somersetshire  called  Chedder Clifts  he felt himself induced to fix on  that  and the rather for that a rumour then prevailed that a man whose mind was deranged had frequently been seen straying in that romantic solitude  I  NOR birth nor fortune did on RAYMOND frown  A noble stem he in his lineage trac'd  And many a virtuous deed descending down  From honour'd ancestry that lineage grac'd  II  But the large prospect of a father's wealth  Inflam'd with frantic joy his youthful mind  In dissipation he impair'd his health  And prudent counsel scatter'd to the wind  III  The rev'rend parent with afflicted eye  Beheld his boy the race of folly run  And oft lamented with a stifled sigh  And oft in gentle phrase rebuk'd his son  IV  Of riot's bane too soon enamour'd grown  Th' impetuous youth disdains the mild rebuke  Retorts displeasure in resentful tone  Or quits his father with indignant look  V  For Dissipation and its boundless train  Of frantic crimes disgrace his ev'ry hour  Intoxication oft invades his brain  And bids him spurn a doting father's pow'r  VI  That doting father whose indulgent cares  Were all employ'd on this unduteous boy  Whose love too sanguine in his rip'ning years  Had garner'd up a store of fancy'd joy  VII  But now of his abandon'd offspring's vice  And scorn of admonition weary grown  Expostulation mild no more he tries  But loud upbraids him with imperious tone  VIII  The frantic youth his hasty arm uprears  Spite of the duty sons to parents owe  Spite of the rev'rence due to silver hairs  And on his father's temples dash'd a blow  IX  What instant horrors RAYMOND then were thine  Cursing the deed which thine own hand had done  Surprise remorse disgrace at once combine  And all hell's torments thro' thy bosom run  X  He thinks each object deprecates the deed  His mother's portrait to his troubled eye  Appears with indignation to recede  From the dire stroke and frown with agony  XI  The father silent dries the blushing stream  Which down his wounded cheek profusely flows  Within his eye conflicting passions gleam  And with indignant fire his visage glows  XII  For love and pity mingling in his face  To check the rising storm of passion try  As struggling sunny rays attempt to chase  The gath'ring gloom of an incensed sky  XIII  An awful pause ensuedthen turning slow  He shew'd his handkerchief deep stain'd with gore  "Behold this blood" he said "Oh child of woe  "Behold thy workbut see thy sire no more"  XIV  He said and left the room Th' abandon'd son  Stood petrified awhile in cold suspence  Then forth instinctively he seem'd to run  Robb'd of each faculty of sight and sense  XV  Impulsive habit led him to the haunts  Of loose associates and th' unnerving bowl  Where Vice its unrestrained triumph vaunts  O'er ev'ry finer feeling of the soul  XVI  False shortliv'd triumph not the echoed sound  Of mirth tumultuous thro' the spendthrift's hall  Can chase the thoughts that his remembrance wound  But each alluring draught is dash'd with gall  XVII  When sated with the treach'rous bane he tries  To woo the balmy comfort of his bed  "Upon the torment of the mind he lies"  Successive horrors goad his restless head  XVIII  If harrass'd thought a short reprieve enjoy  Enwrapp'd in Slumber's momentary bands  Selfopen'd wide the curtains seem to fly  And by his side his bleeding father stands  XIX  He groans he starts the restless pillow flies  To stalk the room in darkness and despair  Where fancy'd spectres haunt his haggard eyes  Whose yells and screams incessant wound his ear  XX  Sudden he meditates in frantic rage  By suicide to end the date of woe  Doubt fills his mind with fearful black presage  And startled Nature shudders at the blow  XXI  He doubtshe ruminates"Dares RAYMOND die  "Beneath a parent's unrelenting ire  "The danger of a new existence try  "And in the fullness of his crimes expire  XXII  "No Heav'n forbid Despair and Madness hence  "With contrite heart I'll seek my father's door  "Pour the full stream of soft'ning penitence  "And pardon prostrate at his feet implore"  XXIII  Thus pond'ring he resolves His father's door  Against his pray'rs and tears fastclos'd remains  The fatal sentence  "See thy sire no more"  Now with redoubled force his mind arraigns  XXIV  Yet day by day he plies a parent's gate  Again he sues and is again repell'd  Nor wins admittance till approaching  fate  Compels that parent's rigid heart to yield  XXV  He yields and RAYMOND comeswith timid eye  The bed of sickness trembling he surveys  While Conscience whispers in a deepdrawn sigh  "Tis RAYMOND hath cut short a father's days"  XXVI  Halfrais'd the parent cast a solemn look  That penetrated to the culprit's heart  Whose stream of life awhile its seat forsook  And life itself seem'd ready to depart  XXVII  "Approach my son"At that benignant name  Poor RAYMOND falling on his slacken'd knee  Feels sudden warmth re animate his frame  Yet hides his face in speechless agony  XXVIII  Thrice he essay'd forgiveness to implore  The sounds halfutter'd fainted on his tongue  "Cease" said the Sire "thy fruitless aim give o'er  "And hear  me  speakthou wilt not hear me long"  XXIX  "Thou seest me struggling in the pangs of death  "The race of painful life wellnigh is run  "Yet ere I draw the latest gasp of breath  "Hear my last words and heed them well my son  XXX  "A child's inheritance is wholly thine  "Of all I have thou'lt find thyself

bed  XXXVII  While now the fun'ral honours were prepar'd  Distractedly from room to room he stray'd  In ev'ry breeze his father's voice he heard  Of ev'ry sound and ev'ry eye afraid  XXXVIII  The fun'ral rites now summon on he goes  And mingles in the dark sepulchral gloom  Nor quits the hallow'd object of his woes  Till silent laid within his mother's tomb  XXXIX  With one long look he takes his final leave  And inly murmurs "Where is  my  repose  "Ne'er till he's shelter'd in the peaceful grave  "Shall RAYMOND's eyes on shame and sorrow close"  XL  Th' attendant train his falt'ring steps support  And guide reluctant to a dreary home  Where Melancholy keeps her solemn court  And spreads around one universal gloom  XLI  The bed of Death he seeks where in his sight  His father's latest

THE ANECDOTES OF A PRIVATE FAMILY  IN *********SHIRE  Murder tho' it have no tongue will speak  With most miraculous organ  Shakespeare's Hamlet  INTRODUCTION  O Mem'ry in thy magic glass  What

of that alluring face  Her converse sweet again I hear  Her judgment strong conception clear  Her turn for raillery and wit  Impressive elegant and neat  Such was she when her partial praise  With

first design'd  The tribute of a grateful mind  To  her  and  Friendship still  consign'd  PREFACE  As the Author of the following Work does not presume either to support or deny the REALITY of APPARITIONS he chuses to decline all unnecessary suggestions on a subject wherein every person has a right to enjoy his own opinion undisturbed and as it was conceived with a view of instruction and the whole tendency is moral and just he hopes with the generality of readers to pass uncensured for treating them with SO PECULIAR A STORY  If there should remain any overscrupulous or overwitty persons who are inclined peremptorily  to condemn or illiberally to deride him he begs leave to answer them with the sentiments of Mr ADDISON on such subjects and those of LUCRETIUS and JOSEPHUS quoted by him in the second volume of his Spectator  I think a person who is thus terrified with the imaginations of GHOSTS and SPECTRES much more reasonable than one who contrary to the reports of all historians sacred and profane antient and modern and to the traditions of all nations thinks the APPEARANCE of SPIRITS fabulous and groundlessCould I not give myself up to this general testimony of mankind I should to the relations of particular persons who are now living and whom I cannot distrust in other matters of fact  So far Mr ADDISON's own opinionhe then proceeds  LUCRETIUS himself though by the course of his philosophy he was obliged to maintain that the soul did not exist separate from the body makes no doubt of the REALITY OF APPARITIONS AND THAT MEN HAVE OFTEN APPEARED AFTER THEIR DEATH  And further having related from JOSEPHUS a circumstance of this kind which befel GLAPHIRA daughter of ARCHELAUS he closes his discourse thus  The example deserves to be taken notice of as it contains a most certain proof of the IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL and of DIVINE PROVIDENCEIf any man thinks these facts incredible let him enjoy his own  opinion to himself but let him not endeavour to disturb the belief of others who by INSTANCES OF THIS NATURE ARE EXCITED TO THE STUDY OF VIRTUE  To the testimony of this excellent modern writer might likewise be added the many striking uses which have been made and the noble purposes of justice which have been effected through the means of such EXTRAORDINARY APPEARANCES by several of our ancient Poets and particularly by that honour to Nature and Genius our own immortal SHAKESPEARE  THE ADVANTAGES OF  REPENTANCE  The following Tale was given to the Public above twenty years ago unconnected with any other work It had the good fortune to pass through four editions but the whole impression having been long since sold off it is at the earnest request of the Author's friends subjoined to the present collection  DREADFUL the state of him whose harden'd heart  Remorse could never pierce whose early youth  To evil prone hath drank the bitter cup  Of Guilt regardless of the poison misery  Wherewith it is imbrued till all his veins  Are fill'd and bloated with the dang'rous venom  And Health and Ease are flown mature in life  Grown ripe in wickedness and swoln with crimes  Who finds his malady yet dares refuse  The sweet and wholesome draught of Penitence  Which the distemper'd mind's physician Conscience  Even to the worst of men will deign to offer  Him sleepless nights and loaded days weigh down  To blackness and despair to him remembrance  Is as a fiend that watches all his steps  Stands in his path and intercepts his walk  Makes ev'n the rushing wind alarm his sense  As if some power more than natural  Rode on the gale while at the gloom of eve  From room to room through all the house he flies  Scar'd by affrightand seeks alas how vain  A moment's peace At length deep furrow'd age  The herald of his

EDWARD on the sultry plains  Of India had endur'd encreasing woes  And number'd all his moments by afflictions  When the fourth year began to store the earth  With fruits and flow'rs unlimited expanse  And prodigality of bounty EDWARD  Arose one morn cheer'd by refreshing sleep  Which long had been a stranger to his bed  His heart was light within him and his eye  Look'd clear around the dross within his breast  Which lim'd his soul to guilt seem'd purg'd away  He heav'd the soft'ning sigh and as by instinct  Bent low to Heav'na posture new to him  He did not prayhe knew not what to ask  While thus 'twixt doubt and sore dismay suspended  Officious Mem'ry set before his view  An awful register of sad misdeeds  He gaz'd astonish'dhere a dow'rless sister  Upbraided him for leaving her at large  To wander through a false and treacherous world  Without a brother's safeconducting hand  There a weak mother sore oppress'd with age  And poverty let fall a sacred drop  And cried "Thus is it with me"Down he sunk  And in a torrent of religious tears  Let loose the fullness of his swelling heart  Wide fast and copious did they flow as erst  The streams forth delug'd from the harden'd rock  Touch'd and resolv'd by MOSES' holy wand  His pains awhile reliev'd EDWARD aloud  Discharg'd his grief "Ah woe is me thus toss'd  "Upon a foreign shore robb'd of relief  "Of hope no sorrowing sister to condole  "No mother to advise no more I boast  "A feeling friend to share my nearest woe  "And ease me of a part where is the man  "Whom once I wrapp'd close close within my heart  "And call'd his

health and vigour while the draught  Ran fresh within the veins and quicken'd life  He toil'd he prosper'devery moment gave  Some large addition to his store and Heav'n  Indulgent smil'd on all he undertook  Mean while his mother tender good MARIA  On ALBION's Isle left sorrowing pin'd away  In anguish for a son her only stay  In life was lost her daughter's sole defence  Since torn from fortune in their earlier days  His industry alone maintain'd the pair  Whene'er she ventur'd all alone to ope  The volume of her mind she saw him her's  And lost in one sad momentsnatch'd away  As 'twere by sudden fateone hour the board  Smil'd at his presence on the next was blank  And fruitless every eye look'd forth for EDWARD  No traces left of him his course unknown  His motives his distress In vain enquiry  Panted on every various wind to find him  Thus o'er their sorrows did this couple brood  And drank their falling tears when ghastly Poverty  Intruded and with meagre hungry look  Appall'd each comely visage wide he strode  And with a horrid joy cry'd "All is mine"  What hope remains alas for worth distress'd  And modest want unless some noble being  Comes timely like a minister of heav'n  To succour and redress in largess wide  To pour his bounties and prevent the blush  Ere yet it rises on the conscious cheek  Of merit undispos'd unus'd to ask  Such was MARIA's happy lot ah would  The sons of fortune oft'ner deign'd regard  The claims of worth distress'd"casting thereon  Their superflux and shewing Heav'n more just"  See Shakespeare's King Lear  Such was MARIA's lot for young HORATIO  Who long had doated on fair ANNA's charms  Halfwither'd in their bloom stepp'd forth and ask'd  The maiden of MARIA ask'd her hand  With humble diffidence as one who held  Nought in his pow'r to give and all to beg  Yet him the luxury of wealth enrich'd  And plenteous meads enclos'dthe mother blush'd  Blush'd for a dow'rless daughter and refus'd  The lover's ardent suit'till well assur'd  That fond affection long before had tied  Their hearts reciprocal she gave her last  Her only bliss away pour'd forth her blessings  Profusely o'er the newmatch'd

MARIA will not grace  "My home In earliest youth alas I lost  "The name of son the blessing of a parent  "Nor could the ample fortunes thence deriv'd  "Requite me for that lossO be it now  "Repair'd in thee Be thou my guardian parent  "Be witness to my care my love of ANNA  "And share our happiness my second mother"  He staid not for replybut hasty seiz'd  Her hand half yielding half reluctant seiz'd  And led her to his home where every moment  Came wing'd with new delightHis life to ANNA  Was all attentive love to good MARIA  All rev'rence and esteem each word had awe  Each look respect and ev'ry favour grace  He gave as one who knew not that he gave  Or wist not what it meant ANNA enrich'd  With all that love or fortune could bestow  Was happiest of the happy and the mother  Save when the thought of EDWARD hapless youth  Struck on her mem'ry felt a smile return  And joy rekindle in her aged heart  Thus flew twelve years on pleasure's silken wing  And all was comfort peace and happiness  Now had the banish'd man persisting still  In penitence to Heav'n and love of virtue  Accumulated wealth beyond the bounds  Of what his largest hope display'd and yearn'd  Spite of the fears that linger'd round his heart  With ardent wish to seek his native clime  To see if ANNA's youth was yielded up  A prey to lawless love if early sorrow  Had nipt the bud and blasted all the fruit  Whether again 'twere giv'n him to behold  A mother's face to tend and cheer her age  With duteous care and love or to bedew  Her sacred manes with religious tears  This lesson had repentance taught his mind  "Let no weak terrors for thyself withhold  "Thy duteous steps or stop thy bounty's course  "Thy mother may survive and want the pittance  "Thou deal'st to ev'ry stranger thou mays't

sails old Ocean boil'd  Around the cleaving keel so swift the course  That wind and vessel seem'd throughout to vie  In vigour of dispatch hence the fifth moon  Ere quite her course was done one April morn  The hills new ting'd with gold beheld him safe  On English ground Delight unspeakable  To hearts unknown to vice The guileless man  Whom search of foreign wealth provokes or care  Of merchandize incites or hapless state  Disastrous war compels awhile to leave  His native climate and connections dear  At his longwish'd return regaining all  What joys are his He stops and panting asks  His heart if all be true he seems new born  And drinks in frequent gasps of happiness  Large draughts of his own air Not so poor EDWARD  Anxious affright and doubt oppress his heart  And stifle in its birth the rising transport  More weight of years and Grief's deforming hand  Had alter'd ev'ry feature from his visage  The vacant smile of dissipated life  And empty joy was flown while solid sense  And comely reason and discretion fair  Supply'd the placeah unavailing all  To chase his fears Beneath a deep disguise  He veil'd each trace of what he once appear'd  Lest when he saw were such his happy lot  His aged parent strong surprise might seize  Her palsied nerves and Nature quit her hold  The dwelling once familiar to his foot  With trembling hasty step he seeksEach eye  Each passing glance alarms him seems to cleave  His wounded soul and lay each thinking bare  The threshold gain'd while yet his shaking hand  Begg'd for admittance prone he fello'erspent  And to the kind inhabitants appear'd  A breathless corseWith charitable care  They rais'd him up and by appliance meet  Quicken'd the pulse and bade it flow anew  Reviv'd and of his proper course inform'd  O blessings on each kindlytemper'd heart  That thus relieves the stranger on he hastens  To seek while ev'ry conscious fear return'd  A mother's presence She her earliest meal  Dispatch'd had totter'd forth as was her wont  And gain'd her fav'rite seat where each new morn  She gaz'd with new delight and in his works  Ador'd the God of Nature paid her thanks  For joys so far beyond the stretch of hope  Show'r'd on her age and with one pious wish  For EDWARD's virtue and return concluded  Her daily orison For now her mind  By time made pliant had receiv'd the stamp  Of that great necessary means of happiness  Submission to her fatethus flow'd her hours  Tranquil and smooth as glides the summer lake  If chance a sudden sigh a while deform'd  Her sweet serenity of soul 'twas slight  And momentary as the passing breeze  For pure Religion cannot long desert  Her willing votaries but repairs the grace  With added lustre as returning suns  Dispel the transient gloom and bid the stream  Again be smooth and clear Nigh where she sat  Was passiontortur'd EDWARD doom'd to pass  Big with a thousand various apprehensions  These words alarm'd his ear "And if he yet  "Survives O be he worthy of thy care  "'Tis all I beg" He turn'd him to the sound  And sawwhat long he stopp'd not to survey  But on the pinions of distraction flew  Knelt and embrac'd and wept upon a mother  Struck with affrightand "Who art thou" she cried  "That thus'when as he press'd her trembling knee  With couchant face all bath'd in drops of shame  A scar which boyish negligence had thrown  Broad o'er his neck awoke remembrance in her  Too strong to bearScarce had she power to say  "Art thou indeed my longlost joy" A sigh  Which shook and all unnerv'd her aged frame  Burst forth and on the fav'rite seat she dropp'd  Swift to his duteous care the youth arose  And "O forgive my desp'rate haste" he cried  "Forgive my zeal my eagerness of love  "I meant at leisure to disclose myself  "But Nature would not let me"Motionless  She still remain'd "And have I thus destroy'd  "The only means of bliss Forbid it Heav'n  "The dearest purpose of my life" Then ran  And call'd aloud for aid himself unfit  Unknowing how to act Forth from the portal  HORATIO ANNA and domestics burst  Alarm'd and haste instinctively to save  Their mansion's honour from the neighb'ring spring  They draw the happy means Once more her eye  Beam'd on the day tho' faint it stray'd around  With timid glance till on her EDWARD's face  It rested full then from the seat she sprung  As if returning youth new strung her nerves  And in her joy triumphant cry'd "Behold him  "More than I dar'd to ask is now bestow'd  "I have a son again" then eager plung'd  Into his clasping arms and there remain'd  Till fainting Nature

in each other's eye alternate seek  And read the cause of their amaze till EDWARD  His pious mother having sought relief  On the same seat where late she lifeless lay  From passions which too exqui itely press'd  Her shatter'd frame ran frantic in his joy  To ANNA to HORATIO o'er and o'er  He seiz'd them and in wildness of embrace  Seem'd to devour their loves On ev'ry visage  Well as he could

And own'd his rev'rend locks confusion stopp'd  The purport of his tongue his heart was full  But on his knee dropp'd sudden he breath'd forth  From fervent heart a thousand thousand blessings  Silent

Mercy's eye I trust the erring hand  "Of youth and rageand sees thy heart explor'd  "No love of guilt no black intention there  "What voice but his could call Why interrupt  "The pious office which engag'd thy soul  "Doth it not seem to sayBehold I shew  "A greater duty far a nearer claim  "Upon thy charity which undischarg'd  "The rest avail thee lightiy Oh pursue  "The wondrous track obey the great command  "And all may yet be well" "Thou best of friends"  EDWARD return'd with soften'd heart and speech  And eyes that melted in affection's dew  "Thy breath is comfort to my heart thy words  "With all conviction's force assail my sense  "To this great duty will I dedicate  "My future hours and leave the rest to Heav'n  "And if he hath not wholly cast me off  "Nor holds my crime tho' foul inexpiable  "May I when I neglect this earthly task  "His purpos'd mercy forseit" Mild discourse  Thus sooths and cheers their hearts reciprocal  Till in their sight the dear abode appears  Where the forsaken family surmising  Some distant act of goodness call'd the friends  With grace united forth compleated well  The righteous work at home and ere they sent  The guests rejoicing forth surcharg'd with stores  They bless'd the day and bade its due return  With annual rites of charity be hallow'd  EDWARD unsuited now to any converse  But that of his own mind requests his friend  To gloze his absence with some fair excuse  And to his chamber calm and clear retires  The chamber gain'd with care and anxious haste  The door he clos'd forbidding e'en a breath  Of transient air should interrupt his thought  Beside his couch in zeal precipitate  Plunging upon his knees "Almighty Father  "If yet by that dear name I dare invoke thee  "Beam from thy throne of mercy one kind ray  "Of comfort on my breast and teach my heart  "How in my conduct I may best atone  "My former guilt and in my hours to come  "Deserve thy gracious careto all that may  "Find favour in thy sight far as I know  "I here devote meev'ry morn and eve  "My heart shall duly seek theeduly praise  "Thy wondrous pow'r beneficence and mercy  "No day unmark'd by charity shall pass  "But chief th' unhappy whom my fatal hand  "By one dire act Oh pardon pardon pardon  "Made poor and widow'dshe shall never know  "A care while life remains if I have power  "To chase it from her breastmy fortune's stream  "Shall flow unbounded o'er her wants and feed  "Her wither'd heart with plentyto her children  "I'll be another father in my love  "And if thy goodness oh my GOD permit  "A length of days for this my pious purpose  "My gratitude shall bless thee if denied  "Rightwilling I submitin ev'ry thing  "Be prais'd thy justice and thy will be done"  Hearteas'd he rose then to his pillow quick  Repairs and coming night whose thicken'd gloom  He wont not to behold without dismay  Reluctant horror each alarm of soul  That apprehension breeds in conscious guilt  With earnest suit he now invokes in sleep  To shed relief on his much harrass'd sense  His suit was heard and Sleep on downy plumes  Descending soft envelop'd all the man  When to his mental eye the very phantom  Which all so late disturb'd his inmost soul  Once more appear'd but clad in other guise  In the late haggard face distracted fear  And writhing pain and agonizing grief  No more were seen no more the bushy locks  With crimson drops were clotted and uprear'd  Each placid feature seem'd by gentle peace  Becalm'd and Satisfaction's sweetest smile  Beam'd lovely soft Content in meek array  Dwelt on the brow and decent lay the locks  So mild the form Tranquility therein  Seem'd to have fix'd her residence entire  Immoveable eternalThus it spake  While drops of comfort from each sacred breath  Melted on EDWARD's heart as kindly dews  From Heav'n descending soft on newborn flowers  "Repentant soul sleep now a quiet sleep  "My pray'r is heard my wishes are accomplish'd  "Thou now hast made a full redressawake  "To care and grief no more henceforth be guilt  "And pain and sorrow strangers to thy breast  "But Peace with all her train inhabit there  "And Pleasure strew thy paths through mortal life  "Safe be thy course and long smooth be the bed  "Of death and fairest gleams of op'ning bliss  "Shine on thy parting spirit since REFENTANCE  "In neverfailing streams hath wash'd away  "The stains of guilt and well thou hast discharg'd  "Thy debt to JUSTICE CHARITY and GOD"  So spake the form benign nor seem'd to leave  The blessed couch till Morn with rosy hand  Expanded full the golden gates of light  Refresh'd and full of gladness EDWARD rose  First wafted grateful praise with holy zeal  Then sought in haste his friend and o'er and o'er  Revolv'd and repossess'd the vision fair  With wonder and delight each greeting eye  He met with transport new the name of son  He long enjoy'd and from that hour awoke  To care and grief no more thenceforth were guilt  And pain and sorrow strangers to his breast  Peace with her lovely train resided there  And pleasure strew'd his paths through mortal life  Safe was his course and long smooth was the bed  Of death and fairest gleams of op'ning bliss  Shone on his parting spiritfor REPENTANCE  In neverfailing streams  had  wash'd away  The stains of guilt and well he had discharg'd  His debt to JUSTICE CHARITY and GOD  THE END
