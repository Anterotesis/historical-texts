History is given in a Series of Letters written principally in a double yet separate Correspondence  Between two young Ladies of virtue and honour bearing an inviolable friendship for each other and writing not merely for amusement but upon the most  interesting  subjects in which every private family more or less may find itself concerned And  Between two Gentlemen of free lives one of them glorying in his talents for Stratagem and Invention and communicating to the other in confidence  all the secret purposes of an intriguing head and resolute heart  But here it will be proper to observe for the sake of such as may apprehend hurt to the morals of Youth from the more freely written Letters that the Gentlemen tho' professed Libertines as to the Female Sex and making it one of their wicked maxims to keep no faith with any of the Individuals of it who are thrown into their power are not however either Infidels or Scoffers nor yet such as think themselves freed from the observance of those other moral duties which bind man to man  On the contrary it will be found in the progress of the Work that they very often make such reflections upon each other and each upon himself and his own actions as reasonable beings  must  make who disbelieve not a Future State of Rewards and Punishments and who one day propose to reformOne of them actually reforming and by that means giving an opportunity to censure the freedoms which fall from the gayer pen and lighter heart of the other  And yet that other altho' in unbosoming himself to a select friend he discover wickedness enough to intitle him to a general detestation preserves a decency as well in his images as in his language which is not always to be found in the works of some of the most celebrated modern Writers whose subjects and characters have less warranted the liberties they have taken  In the Letters of the two young Ladies it is presumed will be found not only the highest exercise of a reasonable and  practicable  Friendship between minds endowed with the noblest principles of Virtue and Religion  but occasionally interspersed such Delicacy of Sentiments particularly with regard to the other Sex such instances of Impartiality each freely as a fundamental principle of their friendship blaming praising and setting right the other as are strongly to be recommended to the observation of the  younger  part more especially of the Female Readers  The principal of these two young Ladies is proposed as an Exemplar to her Sex Nor is it any objection to her being so that she is not in all respects a perfect character It was not only natural but it was necessary that she should have some faults were it only to shew the Reader how laudably she could mistrust and blame herself and carry to her own heart divested of selfpartiality the censure which arose from her own convictions and that even to the acquittal of those because revered characters whom no one else would acquit and to whose much greater faults her errors were owing and not to a weak or reproachable heart As far as is consistent with human frailty and as far as she could be perfect considering the people she had to deal with and those with whom she was inseparably connected she  is  perfect To have been impeccable must have left nothing for the Divine Grace and a Purified State to do and carried our idea of her from woman to angel As such is she often esteemed by the man whose  heart  was so corrupt that he could hardly believe human Nature capable of the purity which on every trial or temptation shone out  hers    Besides the four principal persons several others are introduced whose Letters are characteristic And it is presumed that there will be found in some of them but more especially in those of the chief character among the men and the second character among the women such strokes of Gaiety Fancy and Humour  as will entertain and divert and at the same time both warn and instruct  All the Letters are written while the hearts of the writers must be supposed to be wholly engaged in their subjects the events at the time generally dubious So that they abound not only with critical Situations but with what may be called  instantaneous  Descriptions and Reflections proper to be brought home to the breast of the youthful Reader as also with affecting Conversations many of them written in the dialogue or dramatic way  "  Much more  lively and affecting says one of the principal characters must be the Style of those who write in the height of a  present  distress the mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty the Events then hidden in the womb of Fate  than  the dry narrative unanimated Style of a Person relating difficulties and dangers surmounted can be the relater perfectly at ease and if himself unmoved by his own Story not likely greatly to affect the Heart of the Reader"  What will be found to be more particularly aimed at in the following Work isTo warn the Inconsiderate and Thoughtless of the one Sex against the base arts and designs of specious Contrivers of the otherTo caution Parents against the undue exercise of their natural authority over their Children in the great article of MarriageTo warn Children against preferring a Man of Pleasure to a Man of Probity upon that dangerous but too commonlyreceived notion  That a Reformed Rake makes the best Husband  But above all To investigate the highest and most important Doctrines not only of Morality but of Christianity by shewing them thrown into action in the conduct of the  worthy  characters while the  unworthy  who set those Doctrines at defiance are condignly and as may be said consequentially punished  From what has been said considerate Readers will not enter upon the perusal of the Piece before them as if it were designed  only  to divert and amuse It will probably be thought tedious to all such as  dip  into it expecting a  light Novel  or  transitory Romance  and look upon Story in it interesting as that is generally allowed to be as its  sole end  rather than as a vehicle to the Instruction  Fault having been found particularly by elderly Readers and by some who have weak Eyes with the Smallness of the Type on which some Parts of the Three last Volumes were printed which was done in order to bring the Work that had extended to an undesirable Length into as small a Compass as possible the present Edition is uniformly printed on the largersized Letter of the three made use of before But the doing this together with the Additions abovementioned has unavoidably run the Seven Volumes into Eight  The Work having been originally published at three different times and a greater distance than was intended having passed between the first publication and the second a Preface was thought proper to be affixed to the third and fourth Volumes being the second publication A very learned and eminent Hand was so kind as to favour the Editor at his request with one But the occasion of inserting it being  temporary  and the Editor having been left at liberty to do with it as he pleased it was omitted in the Second Edition when the whole Work came to be printed together as was for the same reason the Preface to the first Volume  and a short Advertisement to the Reader inserted instead of both That Advertisement being also temporary the present Address to the Reader is substituted in its place  In the Second Edition an ample  Table of Contents  to the  whole  Work was prefixed to the first Volume But that having in some measure anticipated the Catastrophe and been thought to detain the Reader too long from entering upon the History it has been judged adviseable to  add  and that rather than  prefix  to  each  Volume its  particular  Contents which will serve not only as an Index but as a brief Recapitulation of the most material passages contained in it and which will enable the Reader to connect in his mind the perused volume with that which follows and more clearly shew the characters and views of the particular correspondents  An ingenious Gentleman having made a Collection of many of the Moral and Instructive Sentiments in this History and presented it to the Editor he thought the design and usefulness of the Work could not be more strikingly exhibited than by inserting it greatly enlarged at the end of the last Volume The Reader will accordingly find it there digested under proper Heads with References to the Pages where each Caution Aphorism Reflection or Observation is to be found either wrought into the  practice  of the respective correspondents or recommended by them as useful  theory  to the Youth of both Sexes  There was a kind of Necessity to omit in this Volume which contains the Restured Passages and Letters the References to the particular Pages as there were two Editions to be referred to had they been inserted which would have only served to puzzle  nd perplex the Reader And it is humbly presumed that the Sentiments or Maxims are generally of such Importance as to be sound not unworthy of the Observation of the youthful Reader altho' they were not to have the close Relation which they  have  to the History of CLARISSA    Different Persons as might be expected have been of different opinions in relation to the conduct of the Heroine in particular Situations and several worthy persons have objected to the general Catastrophe and other parts of the History Whatever is thought material of these shall be taken notice of by way of POSTSCRIPT at the conclusion of the History for this Work being addressed to the Public as a History of  Life  and  Manners  those parts of it which are proposed to carry with them the force of an Example ought to be as unobjectible as is consistent with the  design of the whole  and with  human nature    ADDENDA TO THE FIRST and SECOND EDITIONS OF CLARISSA  Vol  ii  Edit  i  p    l    after the words  condemning myself  insert  _BUT least of all  This passage is inserted in Vol i p of the d Edit  can I bear that you should reflect upon my Mother What my dear if her meekness should not be rewarded Is the want of reward or the want even of a grateful acknowlegement a reason for us to dispense with what we think our duty They were my Father's lively spirits that first made him an interest in her gentle bosom They were the same spirits turned inward as I have heretofore observed  See Edit i p Edit ii p  that made him so impatient when the cruel malady seized him He always loved my Mother And would not LOVE and PITY  excuseably  nay  laudably  make a good Wife who was an hourly  witness of his pangs when labouring under a paroxysm and his paroxysms becoming more and more frequent as well as more and mote severe give up her own will her own likings to oblige a Husband thus afflicted whose love for  her  was unquestionableAnd if so was it not too natural Human nature is not perfect my dear that the Husband thus humoured by the Wife should be unable to bear controul from anybody else much less contradiction from his children  If then you would avoid my highest displeasure you must spare my Mother And surely you will allow me with her to pity as well as to love and honour my Father  I have no friend but you to whom I can appeal to whom I dare complain Unhappily circumstanced as I am it is but too probable that I  shall  complain because it is but too probable that I shall have more and more cause given me  for  complaint But be it your part if I do to sooth my angry passions and to soften my resentments and this the rather as you know what an influence your advice has upon me and as you  must  also know that the fredoms you take with my friends can have no other tendency but to weaken the sense of my duty to them without answering any good end to myself  I cannot help owning  c  Vol  i  Edit  i  p    l    from the bottom and Edit  ii  p    l    from the bottom after  proposal in

of you for God's sake that you will I think myself very unhappy in having incurred your displeasure No Sister can love a Brother better than I love you Pray  do not put the worst but the best constructions upon my proposals when you have them reported to you Indeed I mean the best I have no subterfuges no arts no intentions but to keep to the letter of them You shall yourself draw up everything into writing as strong as you can and I will sign it And what the  Law  will not do to enforce it my  Resolution  and my  Will  shall So that I shall be worth nobody's address tbat has not my Papa's consent Nor shall any person nor any consideration induce me to revoke it You can do more than anybody to reconcile my Parents and Uncles to me Let me owe this desirable favour to your

will say to it altho' beforehand I can tell you these proposals will not answer the principal end  So down she went But it seems my Aunt Hervey and my Uncle Harlowe were gone away And as they have all engaged to act in concert messengers were dispatched to my Uncle and Aunt to desire them to be there to breakfast in the morning  Monday Night    o'Clock    I AM afraid I shall not be thought worthy  Just as I began to fear I should not be thought worthy of an Answer Betty wrapped at my door and said If I were not in bed she had a Letter for me I had but just done writing the above dialogue and  stept to the door with the pen in my handAlways writing Miss said the bold wench It is admirable how you can get away what you writeBut the Fairies they say are always at hand to help Lovers She retired in so much haste that had I been disposed I could not take the notice of this insolence which it deserved  I inclose my Brother's Letter He was resolved to let me see that I should have nothing to expect from his kindness But surely he will not be permitted to carry every point The assembling of my friends tomorrow is a good sign And I will hope something from that and from proposals so reasonable And now I will try if any repose will fall to my lot for the remainder of this night  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Inclosed in the preceding  YOUR proposals will be considered by your Father and Mother and all your Friends tomorrow morning What trouble does your shameful forwardness give us all I wonder you have  c  Vol  i  Edit  i  p    l    and Edit  ii  p    l    after  airs accordingly  insert  Nevertheless as I said above I will hope better things from those who have not the interest my Brother has to keep open these unhappy differences  Tuesday March    WOULD you not have thought my dear Miss Howe as well as I that my proposal must have been accepted And that my Brother by the last article of his unbrotherly Letter where he threatens to go to Scotland if it should be hearkened to was of opinion that it  would  For my part after I had read the unkind Letter  over and over I concluded upon the whole that a Reconciliation upon terms so disadvantageous to myself as hardly any other person in my case I dare say would have proposed must be the result of this morning's conference And in that belief I had begun to give myself new trouble in thinking this difficulty over how I should be able to pacify Lovelace on that part of my engagement by which I undertook to break off all correspondence with him unless my friends should be brought by the interposition of his powerful friends and any offers they might make which it was rather  his  part to suggest than  mine  to intimate to change their minds  Thus was I employed not very agreeably you may believe because of the vehemence of the tempers I had to conflict with when breakfastingtime approached and my judges began to arrive  And oh how my heart fluttered on hearing the chariot of the one and then of the other rattle thro' the courtyard and the hollowsounding footstep giving notice of each person's stepping out to take his place on the awful bench which my fancy had formed for them and my other judges  That thought I is my Aunt Heryey's That my Uncle Harlowe's Now comes my Uncle Antony And my imagination made a fourth chariot for the odious Solmes altho' it happened that he was not there  And now thought I are they all assembled And now my Brother calls upon my Sister to make  her  report Now the hardhearted Bella interlards her speech with invective Now has she concluded her report Now they debate upon itNow does my Brother flame Now threaten to go to Scotland Now is he chidden and now soothed  And then I ran thro' the whole conference in my imagination forming speeches for this person and that  pro  and  con  till all concluded as I flattered myself in an acceptance of my conditions and in giving directions  to have an instrument drawn to tie me up to my good behaviour While I supposed all agreed to give Solmes a Wife every way more worthy of him and with  her  the promise of my Grandfather's Estate in case of my forfeiture or dying unmarried on the righteous condition he proposes to entitle himself to it with me  And now thought I am I to be ordered down to recognize my own proposals And how shall I look upon my awful judges How shall I stand the questions of some the set surliness of others the returning love of one or two How shall I be affected  Then I wept Then I dried my eyes Then I practised at my glass for a look more chearful than my heart  And now as anything stirred is my Sister coming to declare the issue of all Tears gushing again my heart fluttering as a bird against its wires drying my eyes again and again to no purpose  And thus my Nancy excuse the fanciful prolixity was I employed and such were my thoughts and imaginations when I found a very different result from the hopeful conference  For about Ten o'clock up came my Sister with an air of cruel triumph waving her hand with a light flourish  Obedience without reserve is required of you Clary My Papa is justly incensed that you should  presume  to dispute his will and to make conditions with him He knows what is best for you And as you own matters are gone a great way between this hated Lovelace and you they will believe nothing you say except you will give the  only  instance that will put them out of doubt of the sincerity of your promises  What child are you surprisedCannot you speakThen it seems you had expected a different issue had youStrange that you could With all your acknowlegements and confessions so creditable to your  noted prudence    I was indeed speechless for some time My eyes were even fixed and ceased to flow But upon the hardhearted Bella's proceeding with her airs of insult Indeed I  was  mistaken said I Indeed I wasFor in you Bella I expected I hoped for a Sister  What interrupted she with all your mannerly flings and your despising airs did you expect that I was capable of telling stories for youDid you think that when I was asked my own opinion of the sincerity of your declarations I could not tell them  how far matters had gone between you and your Fellow  When the intention is to bend that stubborn will of yours to your duty do you think I would deceive themDo you think I would encourage them to call you down to contradict all that I should have  invented  in your favour  Well well Bella I am the less obliged to you that's all I was willing to think that I had still a Brother and Sister But I find I am mistaken  Pretty Mopsaeyed soul  was her expressionAnd was it willing to think it had still a  Brother  and  Sister  And why don't you go on Clary mocking my halfweeping accent I thought too I had a  Father  and  Mother two Uncles  and an  Aunt But I am mis taken that's all  Come Clary say this and it will in part be true because you have thrown off their authority and because you respect one vile wretch more than them all  How have I deserved this at your hands Sister But I will only say I pity you  And with that disdainful air too ClaryNone of that bridled neck None of your scornful pity Girl I beseech you  This sort of behaviour is natural to you surely BellaWhat  new  talents does it discover in you But proceedIf it be a pleasure to you proceed Bella And since I must not pity  you  I will pity  myself  For nobody else will  Because you don't said she  Hush Bella interrupting her  Because I don't deserve it  I know you were going to say so I will say as you say in everything and that's the way to please you  Then say Lovelace is a villain  So I will when I think him so  Then you don't think him so  Indeed I don't  You  did not always Bella  And what Clary mean you by that bristling up to meTell me what you mean by that reflection  Tell me why you call it a reflectionWhat did I say  Thou art a provoking creatureBut what say you to two or three duels of that wretch's  I can't tell what to say unless I knew the occasions  Do you justify duelling at all  I do not Neither can I help his duelling  Will you go down and humble that stubborn spirit of yours to your Mamma  I said nothing  Shall I conduct your Ladyship down offering to take my declined hand  What not vouchsafe to answer me  I turned from her in silence  What turn your back upon me tooShall I bring up your Mamma to you Love following me and taking my struggling hand What not speak yet Come my sullen silent dear speak one word to meYou must say  two  very soon to Mr Solmes I can tell you that  Then gushing out into tears which I could not hold in longer they shall be the last words I will ever speak  Well well insultingly wiping my averted face with her handkerchief while her other hand held mine in a ridiculing tone I am glad anything will make thee speak Then you think you may be  brought to speak the  two  wordsOnly they are to be the lastHow like a gentle  Lovyer  from its tender bleeding heart was that  Ridiculous Bella  Saucy Clary changing her sneering tone to an imperious one But do you think you can humble yourself to go down to your Mamma  I am tired with such stuff as this Tell me Bella if my Mamma will condescend to see me  Yes if you can be dutiful at last  I can I will  But what call you dutiful  To give up my own  inclinations  That's something more for you to tell ofin obedience to my Parents commands and to beg I may not be made miserable with a man that is fitter for  anybody  than for me  For  me  do you mean Clary  Why not since you have put the question You have a better opinion of him than I have My friends I hope would not think him too good for  me  and not good  enough  for  you  But cannot you tell me Bella what is to become of me without insulting over me thusIf I must be thus treated remember that if I am guilty of any rashness the usage I meet with will justify it  So Clary you are contriving an  excuse  I find for somewhat that we have not doubted has been in your head a great while  If it were so you seem resolved for  your  part and so does my Brother for  his  that I shall not want one But indeed Bella I can bear no longer this repetition of the worst part of yesterday's conversation I desire I may throw myself at my Father's and Mother's feet and hear from them what their sentence is I shall at least avoid by that means the unsisterly insults I meet with from you  Heyday What is this you Is it you my meek Sister Clary  Yes it is I Bella and I will claim the protection due to a child of the family or to know why I am to be thus treated when I offer only to preserve to myself the Liberty of  refusal  which belongs to my Sex and to please my Parents would give up my  choice  I have contented myself till now to take  secondhand  messengers and  firsthand  insults You are but my Sister My Brother is not my Sovereign And while I have a Father and Mother living I will not be thus treated by a Brother and Sister and their servants all setting upon me as it should seem to make me desperate and to do a rash thingI will know in short Sister Bella  why  I am to be constrained thus What is intended by itAnd whether I am to be considered as a  child  or a  slave  She stood aghast all this time partly with real partly with affected surprize  And is it  you  Is it  indeed  youWell Clary you amaze me But since you are so desirous to refer yourself to your Father and Mother I will go down and tell them what you say Your friends are not yet gone I believe They shall assemble again and then you may come down and plead your own cause in person  Let me then But let my  Brother  and  you  be absent You have made yourselves too much  parties  against me to sit as my judges And I desire to have none of yours or his interpositions I am sure you could not have represented what I proposed fairly I am  sure  you could not Nor is it possible you should be  commissioned  to treat me thus  Well well I'll call up my Brother to youI will indeedHe shall justify himself as well as me  I desire not to see my Brother except he will come  as  a Brother laying aside the authority he has unjustly assumed over me  And so Clary it is nothing to him or to me is it that our Sister shall disgrace her whole family  As how Bella disgrace itThe man whom you thus freely treat is a man of birth and fortune He is a man of parts and nobly alliedHe was once thought worthy of you and I wish to Heaven you had had him I am sure it was not my fault you had not altho' you treat me thus  This set her into a flame I wish I had forborn it O how the poor Bella raved I thought she would have beat me once or twice And she vowed her fingers itched to do soBut I was not worth her  anger  Yet she flamed on  We were heard to be highAnd Betty came up from my Mother to command my Sister to attend herShe went down accordingly threatening me with letting every one know what a violent creature I had shewn myself to be  Tuesday Noon March    I HAVE as yet heard no more of my Sister And I have not courage enough to insist upon throwing myself at the feet of my Father and Mother as I thought in my heat of temper I should be able to do And I am now grown as calm as ever and were Bella to come up again as fit to be played upon as before  I am indeed sorry that I sent her from me in such disorder But my Papa's Letter threatening me with my Uncle Antony's house and chapel terrifies me strangely and by their silence I am afraid some new storm is gathering  But what shall I do with this Lovelace I have just now by the unsuspected hole in the wall  that I told you of in my Letter by Hannah  got a Letter from himSo uneasy is he for fear I should be prevailed upon in Solmes's favour so full of menaces if I am so resenting the usage I receive for how I cannot tell but he has undoubtedly intelligence of all that is done in the family such protestations of inviolable  faith and honour such vows of reformation such pressing arguments to escape from this disgraceful confinementO my Nancy what shall I do with this Lovelace  Vol  ii  Edit  i  p    l    after  absurdities call for  insert  You  This

yourself in my place or in the place of those who are still more indifferent to the case than I can beIf you  can  But altho' I have you not often at advantage I will not push you  Permit me however to subjoin That well may your Father love your Mother as you say he does A Wife who has no Will but his But were there not think you some struggles between them at first gout out of the questionYour

protection of Mrs Howe if farther driven yet he had artfully taken care by means of his agent in the Harlowefamily not only to inflame the family against her but to deprive her of Mrs Howe's and of every other protection being from the first resolved to reduce her to an absolute dependence upon himself See Vol  i  Letter  xxxi  Vol  ii  Edit  i  p    l    and Edit  ii  p    l    after  is my

Edit  i  p    l    and Edit  ii  p    l    after  look sorrowful  insert the following Letters  Mr  HICKMAN  To Mrs  HOWE    Wednesday Mar    Madam  IT is with infinite regret that I think myself obliged by pen and ink to repeat my apprehensions that it is impossible for me ever to obtain a share in the Affections of your beloved Daughter O that it were not too evident to every one as well as to myself even to our very servants that my Love for her and my Assiduities expose me rather to her Scorn Forgive me Madam the hard word than to the treatment due to a man whose proposals have met with your approbation and who loves her above all the women in the world  Well might the merit of my passion be doubted if like Mr Solmes to the truly admirable Miss Clarissa Harlowe I could continue my addresses to Miss Howe's distaste Yet what will not the discontinuance cost me  Give me leave nevertheless dearest worthiest Lady to repeat what I told you on Monday night at Mrs Larkins's with a heart even bursting with grief That I wanted not the treatment of that day to convince me that I am not nor ever can be the object of Miss Howe's voluntary favour What hopes can there be that a Lady will ever esteem as a Husband the man whom as a Lover she despises Will not every act of obligingness from such a one be construed an unmanly tameness of spirit and entitle him the more to her disdainMy heart is full Forgive me if I say that Miss Howe's treatment of me does no credit either to her education or fine sense  Since then it is too evident that she cannot esteem me and since as I have heard it justly observed by the excellent Miss Clarissa Harlowe that Love is not a voluntary passion would it not be ungenerous to subject the dear Daughter to the displeasure of a Mother so justly fond of her and you Madam while you are so good as to interest yourself in my favour to uneasiness And why were I to be even sure at last of succeeding by means of your kind partiality to me should I wish to make the Bestbeloved of my soul unhappy since mutual must be our happiness or misery for life the consequence to both  My best wishes will for ever attend the dear the everdear Lady May her Nuptials be happy They must be so if she marry the man she can honour with her Love Yet I will say that whoever be the happy the thrice happy man he never can love her with a passion more ardent and more sincere than mine  Accept dear Madam of my most grateful thanks for a distinction that has been the only support of my presumption in the address I am obliged as utterly hopeless to discontinue A distinction on which and not on my own merits I had entirely relied but which I find can avail me nothing To the last hour of my life it will give me pleasure to think that had your favour your recommendation been of sufficient weight to conquer what seems to be an invincible Aversion I had been the happiest of men  I am dear Madam with inviolable respect  Your everobliged and faithful humble Servant  CHARLES HICKMAN  Mrs  HOWE  To  CHARLES HICKMAN  Esq  Thursday March    I Cannot but say Mr Hickman but you have cause to be dissatisfiedto be out of humourto be displeasedwith NancyBut upon my word But indeedWhat shall I sayYet this I will say that you  good  young gentlemen know nothing at all of our Sex Shall I tell youBut why should I And yet I will say That if Nancy did not think well of you in the main she is too generous to treat you so freely as she doesDon't you think she has courage enough to tell me She would not see you and to refuse at any time seeing you as she knows on what account you come if she had not something in her head favourable to youFie that I am forced to say thus much in writing when I have hinted it to you twenty and twenty times by word of mouth  But if you are so indifferent Mr HickmanIf you think you can part with her for her skittish tricks If  my  interest in your favourWhy Mr Hickman I must tell you that my Nancy is worth bearing with If she be  foolish  what is that owing to  Is it not to her  Wit  Let me tell you Sir you cannot have the convenience without the inconvenience What workman loves not a sharp tool to work with But is there not more danger from a sharp tool than from a blunt one And what workman will throw away a sharp tool because it may cut his fingers Wit may be likened to a sharp tool And there is something very pretty in Wit let me tell you Often and often have I been forced to smile at her arch turns upon me when I could have beat her for them And pray don't I bear a great deal from herAnd why Because I love her And would you not wish me to judge of your Love for her by my own And would not you bear with herDon't you love her what tho' with another sort of Love as well as I do I do assure you Sir that if I thought you did notWell but it is plain that you don'tAnd is it plain that you don'tWell then you must do as you think best  Well might the merit of your passion be doubted you say if like Mr SolmesFiddlesaddleWhy you are a captious man I thinkHas Nancy been so plain in her repulses of you as Miss Clary Harlowe has been to Mr SolmesDoes Nancy love any man better than you altho' she may not shew so much Love to you as you wish forIf she did let me tell you she would have let us all hear of itWhat idle comparisons then  But it may be you are tired out It may be you have seen somebody elseIt may be you would wish to change Mistresses with that gay wretch Mr Lovelace It may be too that in that case Nancy would not be sorry to change LoversThe  truly admirable  Miss Clarissa Harlowe And the  excellent  Miss Clarissa HarloweGoodlackBut take care Mr Hickman that you do not praise any woman living let her be as admirable and as excellent as she will above your own Mistress No polite man will do that surely  And take care too that you do not make her or me think you are in earnest in your angerJust tho' it may be as anger onlyI would not for a thousand pounds that Nancy should know that you can so easily part with her if you have the Love for her which you declare you have Be sure if you are not absolutely determined that you do not so much as whisper the contents of this your Letter to your own heart as I may say  Her treatment of you you say does no credit either to her education or fine sense Very home put truly Nevertheless so say I But is not hers the disgrace more than yours I can assure you that everybody blames her for it And  why  do they blame herWhy Because they think you merit better treatment at her hands And is not this to your credit Who but pities  you  and blames  her  Do the servants who as you observe see her skittish airs disrespect you for them Do they not at such times look concerned for you Are they not then doubly officious in their respects and services to youI have observed with pleasure that they are  But you are afraid you shall be thought tame perhaps when married That you shall not be thought  manly  enough I warrantAnd this was poor Mr Howe's fear And many a tug did this lordly fear cost us both God knowsMany more than needed I am sureAnd more than ought to have been had he known how to  bear and forbear  as is the duty of those who pretend to have most senseAnd pray which would you have to have most sense the woman or the man  Well Sir and now what remains if you really love Nancy so well as you say you doWhy I leave that to you You may if you please come to breakfast with me in the morning But with no  full heart  nor resenting looks I advise you except you can brave it out That

xxxiv  that Mr Lovelace's motive for sparing his Rosebud was twofold First Because his Pride was gratified by the Grandmother's desiring him to spare her Granddaughter  Many a pretty Rogue  says he  had I spared whom I did not spare had my Power been acknowleged and my Mercy in time implored But the  Debellare Superbos  should be my motto were I to have a new one    His other motive will be explained in the following passage in the same Letter  I never was so honest for so long together  says he  since my matriculation It  behoves me  so to be  Some way or other  my recess  at this little Inn  may be found out and it will then be thought that my Rosebud has attracted me A report in my favour from simplicities so amiable may establish me  c  Accordingly as the Reader will hereafter see Mr Lovelace finds by the  Effects  his expectations from the contrivance he set on foot by means of his agent Joseph Leman who plays as above upon Betty Barnes fully answered tho' he could not know what passed on the occasion between the two Ladies  This explanation is the more necessary to be given as several of our Readers thro' want of due attention have attributed to Mr Lovelace on his behaviour to his Rosebud a greater merit than was due to him and moreover imagined that it was improbable that a man  who was capable of acting so generously as they supposed in  this  instance should be guilty of any  atrocious  vileness Not considering that Love Pride and Revenge as he owns in Vol  i  Letter  xxxi  were ingredients of equal force in his composition and that Resistance was a  stimulus  to him  Vol  iii  Edit  i  p    l    on the words  to take it  add the following Note  Clarissa  This Note is inserted Vol iii p of the d Edition  has been censured as

a due attention to the Story How early as above and in what immediately follows does he remind her of the terms of distance which she prescribed to him before she was in his power  in hopes to leave a door open for the reconciliation with her friends  which her heart was set upon And how artfully does he unrequired promise to observe the conditions which she in her present circumstances and situation in pursuance of Miss Howe's advice would gladly have dispensed withTo say nothing of the resentment which she was under a  necessity  to shew at the manner of his getting her away in order

strides already towards reformation For dost  thou not see that while I have been so assiduously night and day pursuing this single charmer I have infinitely less to answer for than otherwise I should have had Let me see how many days and nights Forty I believe after open trenches spent in the sap only and never a mine sprung yet  By a moderate computation a dozen kites might have fallen while I have been only trying to ensnare this single lark Nor yet do I see when I shall be able to bring her to my lure More innocent days yet thereforeBut reformation for my stalkinghorse I hope will be a sure tho' a slow method to effect all my purposes  Then Jack  thou  wilt have a merit too in engaging my pen since thy time would be otherwise worse employed And after all who knows but by creating new habits at the expence of the old a real reformation may be brought about I have promised it and I believe there is a pleasure to be found in being good reversing that of Nat Lee's madmen  Which none but  good  men know  By all this seest thounot how greatly preferable it is on twenty accounts to pursue a difficult rather than an easy chace I have a desire to inculcate this pleasure upon thee and to teach thee to fly at nobler game than daws crows and wigeons I have a mind to shew thee from time to time in the course of the correspondence thou hast so earnestly wished me to begin on this illustrious occasion that these exalted Ladies may be abased and to obviate one of the objections that thou madest to me when we were last together that the pleasure which attends these nobler aims remunerates not the pains they bring with them since like a paltry fellow as thou wert thou assertedst that all women are alike  Thou knowest nothing Jack of the delicacies of intrigue Nothing of the glory of outwitting the  Witty and the Watchful Of the joys that fill the mind of the inventive or contriving genius ruminating which to use of the different webs that offer to him for the entanglement of a haughty charmer who in her day has given him unnumbered torments Thou Jack who like a dog at his ease contentest thyself to growl over a bone thrown out to thee dost not know the joys of the chace and in pursuing a winding game These I will endeavour to rouse thee to and thou wilt have reason doubly and trebly to thank me as well because of thy present delight as with regard to thy prospects beyond the moon  To this place I had written purely to amuse myself before I was admitted to my charmer But now I have to tell thee that I was quite right in my conjecture that she would set up for herself and dismiss me For she has declared in so many words that such was her resolution And why Because to be plain with me the more she saw of  me  and of  my ways  the less she liked of either  This cut me to the heartI did not cry indeed Had I been a  woman  I should tho' and that most plentifully But I pulled out a white cambrick handkerchief  That  I could command but not my  tears    She finds fault with my protestations with my professions with my vows I cannot curse a servant the only privilege a master is known by but I am supposed to be a trooper  See Vol iii Edit

conditioning with a Father  is a maxim with my Father and with my Uncles If I would have gone Mr Lovelace would have opposed it So I must have been under his controul or have run away  from  him as it is supposed I did  to  him from HarlowePlace In what a giddy light would this have made me appearHad he constrained me could I have appealed to my friends for  their  protection without risquing the very consequences to prevent which setting up myself presumptuously as a middle person between flaming spirits I have run into such terrible inconveniencies  But after all must it not give me great

had warmer dialogues than ever yet we have had At fair argument  I find I need not fear him  See this confirmed by Mr Lovelace Vol iii Edit i and ii p  But he is such a wild such an ungovernable creature  He  reformed that I am halfafraid of him  He again on my declaring myself uneasy at his stay with me here proposed that I would put myself into Lady Betty's protection assuring me that he thought he could not leave me at Mrs Sorlings's with safety to myself And upon my declining to do that for the reasons I gave you in my last  Ibid p  he urged me to make a demand of my Estate  He knew it I told him to be my resolution not to litigate with my Father  Nor would he put me upon it he replied but as the  last  thing But if my spirit would not permit me to be  obliged  as I called it to anybody and yet if my relations would refuse me my own he knew not how I could keep up that spirit without being put to inconveniencies which would give him infinite concernUnlessunlessunless he said hesitating as if afraid to speak outUnless I would take the only method I  could  take to obtain the possession of my own  What is  that  Sir  Sure the man saw by my looks when he came with his creeping  Unless's  that I guessed what he meant  Ah Madam can you be at a loss to know what that method isThey will not dispute with a  man  that right which they would contest with  you    Why said he with a  man  instead of with  him  Yet he looked as if he wanted to be encouraged to say more  So Sir you would have me employ a Lawyer would you notwithstanding what I have ever declared as to litigating with my Papa  No I would not my dearest Creature snatching my hand and pressing it with his lipsexcept you would make  me  the Lawyer  Had he said  me  at first I should have been above the affectation of mentioning a Lawyer  I blushed The man pursued not the subject so ardently but that it was more easy as well as more natural to avoid it than to fall into it  Would to Heaven he might without offending But I  so  overawed him  Overawed  him  Your  See Vol iii Edit i and ii p  notion my dear And so the overawed bashful man went off from the subject repeating his proposal that I would demand my own Estate or impower some man of the Law to demand it if I  would not  he put in impower a happier man to demand it But it could not be amiss he thought to acquaint my two Trustees that I intended to assume it  I should know better what to do I told him when he was at a distance from me and  known  to be so I suppose Sir that if my Father propose my return and engage never to mention Solmes to me nor any other man but by  my consent  and I agree upon that condition to think no more of  you  you will acquiesce  I was willing to try whether he had the regard to  all  my previous declarations which he pretended to have to  some  of them  He was struck all of a heap  What say you Mr Lovelace You know all you mean is for my good Surely I am my own mistress Surely I need not ask your leave to make what terms I please for myself  so long as I break none with you  He hemm'd twice or thriceWhy Madam Why Madam I cannot sayThen pausingand rising from his seat with petulance I see plainly enough said he the reason why none of my proposals can be accepted At  last  I am to be a sacrifice to your Reconciliation with your implacable family  It has always been your respectful way Mr Lovelace to treat my family in this free manner But pray Sir when you call  others  implacable see that you deserve not the same censure  yourself    He must needs say there was no love lost between some of my family and him but he had not deserved of  them  what they had of  him    Yourself being judge I suppose Sir  All the world you yourself Madam being judge  Then Sir let me tell you had you been less upon your defiances they would not have been irritated so much against you But nobody ever heard that avowed despite to the Relations of a person was a proper courtship either to that person or to her friends  Well Madam all that I know is that their malice against me is such that if you determine to sacrifice  me  you may be reconciled when you please  And all that I know Sir is that if I do give my Father the power of a negative and he will be contented with  that  it will be but my  duty  to give it him and if I preserve one to myself I shall break thro' no obligation to  you    Your duty to your capricious  Brother  not to your  Father  you mean Madam  If the dispute lay between my Brother and me at  first  surely Sir a Father may chuse which party he will take  He  may  MadamBut that exempts him not from blame for all that if he take the wrong  Different people will judge differently Mr Lovelace of the right and the wrong  You  judge as you please Shall not others as  they  please And who has a right to controul a Father's judgment in his own family and in relation to his own child  I know Madam there is no arguing with you But nevertheless I had hoped to have made myself some little merit with you so as that I might not  have been the  preliminary sacrifice  to a Reconciliation  Your hopes Sir had been better grounded if you had had my consent to my abandoning of my Father's house  Always Madam and for ever to be reminded of the choice you would have made of that damn'd Solmesrather than  Not so hasty Not so rash Mr Lovelace I am convinced that there was no intention to marry me to that Solmes on Wednesday  So I am told they now give out in order to justify themselves at your expence Everybody living Madam is obliged to you for your kind thoughts but I  Excuse me  good  Mr Lovelace waving my hand and bowing that I am willing to think the best of my Father  Charming Creature said he with what a bewitching air is that saidAnd with a vehemence in his manner would have snatched my hand But I withdrew it being much offended with him  I think Madam my sufferings for your sake might have entitled me to some favour  My  sufferings Sir for  your  impetuous temper set against  your  sufferings for  my sake  I humbly conceive leave me very little your debtor  Lord Madam assuming a drolling air What have  you  sufferedNothing but what you can easily forgive You have been  only  made a prisoner in your Father's house by the way of doing credit to your judgmentYou have  only  had an innocent and faithful servant turned out of your service because you loved herYou have  only  had your Sister's confident servant set over you with leave to teaze and affront you  Very well Sir  You have  only  had an insolent Brother take upon  him to treat you like a slave and as insolent a Sister to undermine you in everybody's favour on pretence to keep you out of hands which if as vile as they vilely report are not however half so vile and cruel as their own  Go on Sir if you please  You have  only  been persecuted in order to oblige you to have a sordid fellow whom you have professed to hate and whom everybody despises The Licence has been  only  got The Parson has  only  been held in readiness The day a near a  very  near day has been  only  fixed And you were  only  to be searched for your correspondencies and still closer confined till the day came in order to deprive you of all means of escaping the snare laid for youBut all This you can forgive You can wish you had stood all This inevitable as the compulsion must have beenAnd the man who at the hazard of his life has delivered you from all these mortifications is the only person you  cannot  forgive  Can't you go on Sir You see I have patience to hear you Can't you go on Sir  I can Madam with  my  sufferings Which I confess ought not to be mentioned were I at last to be rewarded in the manner I hoped  Your  sufferings then if you please Sir  Affrontingly forbidden your Father's house after encouragement given without any reasons they knew not before to justify the prohibition Forced upon a rencounter I wished to avoid the first I ever so provoked wished to avoid And that because the wretch was your Brother  Wretch SirAnd my BrotherThis could be from no man breathing but from him before me  Pardon me MadamBut oh how unworthy to be your BrotherThe quarrel grafted upon an old one when at College he universally known to be the aggressor and revived for views equally sordid  and injurious both to yourself and meGiving life to him who would have taken away mine  Your  generosity  THIS Sir not your sufferings A little more of your  sufferings  if you pleaseI hope you do not repent that you did not murder my Brother  My private life hunted into My morals decried Some of the accusers not unfaulty  That's an aspersion Sir  Spies set upon my conduct One hired to bribe my own servant's fidelity perhaps to have poisoned me at last if the honest fellow had not  Facts  Mr LovelaceDo you want facts in the display of your sufferingsNone of your  Perhaps's  I beseech you  Menaces every day and defiances put into every one's mouth against me Forced to creep about in disguisesand to watch  all hours    And in  all weathers  I suppose SirThat I remember was once your grievance  In all weathers  Sir  See Vol iii Edit i and ii p  And all these hardships arising from yourself not imposed by me  Like a thief or an evesdropper proceeded he And yet neither by birth nor alliances unworthy of  their  relation whatever I may be and am of their admirable Daughter Of whom they every one of them are at least as unworthyThese Madam I call sufferings  Justly  call so if at last I am to be sacrificed to an imperfect Reconciliation  Imperfect  I say For can you expect to live so much as  tolerably  under the same roof after all that is passed with that Brother and Sister  O Sir Sir What sufferings have yours been And all for my sake I warrantI can never reward you for themNever think of me more I beseech youHow can you have patience with meNothing has been owing to your own behaviour I presume  Nothing to your defiances for defiances Nothing to your resolution declared more than once that you  would  be related to a family which nevertheless you would not stoop to ask a Relation of Nothing in short to courses which everybody blamed you for you not thinking it worth your while to justify yourself Had I not thought you used in an ungentlemanly manner as I have heretofore told you you had not had my notice by pen and ink  See Vol iii Edit i and ii p  That notice gave you a supposed security and you generously defied my friends the more for it And this brought upon me perhaps not undeservedly my Father's displeasure without which my Brother's private pique and selfish views would have wanted a foundation to build upon So that all that followed of my treatment and your redundant  Only's  I might thank you for principally as you may yourself for all your  sufferings  your  mighty  sufferings And if voluble Sir you have founded any merit upon them be so good as to revoke it And look upon  me  with my forfeited reputation as the only suffererFor whatPray hear me out Sir for he was going to speak have you suffered in but your pride Your reputation  could not  suffer  That  it was beneath you to be solicitous about And had you not been an unmanageable man I should not have been driven to the extremity I now every hour as the hour passes deploreWith this additional reflection upon myself that I ought not to have  begun  or having begun not  continued  a correspondence with one who thought it not worth his while to clear his own character for  my sake  or to submit to my Father for  his own  in a point wherein every Father ought to have an option  Darkness light Light darkness by my Soul Just as you please to have it O Charmer of my heart snatching my hand and pressing it between both his to his lips in a strange wild way Take me  take me to yourself Mould me as you please I am wax in your hands Give me your own impression and seal me for ever yoursWe were born for each otherYou to make me happy and save a soulI am all error all crime I see what I ought to have done But do you think Madam I can willingly consent to be sacrificed to a partial Reconciliation in which I shall be so great so irreparable a sufferer Anything but  that  Include me in your terms Prescribe to me Promise for me as you pleasePut a halter about my neck and lead me by it upon condition of forgiveness on that disgraceful penance and of a prostration as servile to your Father's presence your Brother absent and I will beg his consent at his feet and bear anything but spurning from him because he is your Father But to give you up upon  cold  conditions Dn me said the shocking wretch if I either will or can  These were his words as near as I can remember them for his behaviour was so strangely wild and fervent that I was perfectly frighted I thought he would have devoured my hand I wished myself a thousand miles distant from him  I told him I by no means approved of his violent temper He was too boisterous a man for my liking I saw  now  by the conversation that had passed what was his boasted regard to my  Injunctions  and should take my measures accordingly as he should  soon  find And with a halffrighted earnestness I desired him to withdraw and leave me to myself  He obeyed and that with extreme complaisance in his manner but with his complexion greatly heightened and a countenance as greatly dissatisfied  But on recollecting all that passed I plainly see that he means not if he can help it to leave me to the liberty of refusing him which I had nevertheless preserved a  right  to do but looks upon me as  his  by a strange sort of obligation for having run away with me  against my will    Yet you see he but touches upon the edges of matrimony neither And that at a time generally when he has either excited one's passions or apprehensions so that one cannot at once descend But surely this cannot be his designAnd yet such seemed to be his behaviour to my Sister  See Vol i Edit i and ii p  when he provoked her to refuse him and so tamely submitted as he did to her refusalBut he dare notWhat can one say of so various a man I am now again out of conceit with him I wish I were fairly out of his power  He has sent up three times to beg admittance in the two last with unusual earnestness But I have sent him word I will first finish what I am about  What to do about going from this place I cannot tell I could stay here with all my heart as I have said to him The Gentlewoman and her Daughters are desirous that I will altho' not very convenient for them I believe neither But I see he will not leave me while I doSo I  must  remove somewhere  I have long been sick of myself And now I am more and more so But let me not lose your good opinion If I do that loss will complete the misfortunes of  Your  CL HARLOWE  Sunday Night    April    I May send to you altho' you are forbid to write to me may I notFor that is not a  correspondence  Is it where Letters are not answered  I am strangely at a loss what to think of this man He is a perfect Proteus I can but write according to the shape he assumes at the time Don't think  me  the changeable person I beseech you if in one Letter I contradict what I wrote in another nay if I seem to contradict what I said in the same Letter For he is a perfect chameleon or rather more variable than the chameleon for that it is said cannot assume  the  red  and the  white  but this man  can  And tho'  black  seems to be his natural colour yet has he taken great pains to make me think him nothing but  white    But you shall judge of him as I proceed Only if I anywhere appear to you to be credulous I beg you to set me right For you are a standerby as you say in a former  See Vol iii Edit i p and Edit ii p  Would to Heaven I were not to play For I think after all I am held to a desperate game  Before I could finish my last to you he sent up twice more to beg admittance I returned for answer that I would see him at my own time I would neither be invaded nor prescribed to  Considering how we parted and my delaying his  audience  as he sometimes calls it I expected him to be in no very good humour when I admitted of his visit and by what I wrote you will conclude that  I  was not Yet mine soon changed when I saw his extreme humility at his entrance and heard what he had to say  I have a Letter Madam said he from Lady Betty Lawrance and another from my Cousin Charlotte But of these more byandby I came now to make my humble acknowlegements to you upon the arguments that passed between us so lately  I was silent wondering what he was driving at  I am a most unhappy creature proceeded he Unhappy from a strange impatiency of spirit which I cannot conquerIt always brings upon me deserved humiliation But it is more laudable to acknowlege than to persevere when under the power of conviction  I was still silent  I have been considering what you proposed to me Madam that I should acquiesce with such terms as you should think proper to comply with in order to a Reconciliation with your friends  Well Sir  And I find all just all right on your side and all impatience all inconsideration on mine  I stared you may suppose Whence this change Sir And so soon  I am so much convinced that you must be in the right in all you think fit to insist upon that I shall for the future mistrust myself and if it be possible whenever I differ with you take an hour's time for recollection before I give way to that vehemence which an opposition to which I have not been accustomed too often gives me  All this is mighty good Sir But to what does it tend  Why Madam when I came to consider what you had proposed as to the terms of Reconciliation with your friends and when I recollected that you had always  referred to yourself  to  approve  or  reject  me according to my  merits  or  demerits  I plainly saw that it was rather a  condescension  in you that you were pleased to ask my consent to those terms than that you were imposing a  new Law  And I now Madam beg your pardon for my impatience Whatever terms you think proper to come into with your Relations which will enable you to honour me with the  conditional  effect of your promise to me these be pleased to consent to And if I lose you insupportable as that thought is to me yet as it must be by my own fault I ought to thank myself for it  What think you Miss HoweDo you believe he can have any view in thisI cannot see any he could have and I thought it best as he put it in so right a manner to appear not to doubt the sincerity of his confession and to accept of it as sincere  He then read to me part of Lady Betty's Letter turning down the beginning which was a little too severe upon him he said for my eye And I believe by the style the remainder of it was in a  corrective  strain  It was too plain I told him that he must have great faults that none of his Relations could write to him but with mingled censure for some bad action  And it is as plain my dearest creature said he that you who know not of any such faults but by surmise are equally ready to condemn meWill not charity allow you to infer that  their  charges are no better groundedAnd that my principal fault has been carelesness of my character and too little solicitude to clear myself when aspersed Which I do assure you is the case  Lady Betty  c  Vol  iii  Edit  i  p    l    from the bottom and Edit  ii  p    l    after  had never erred  insert  A fine Rakish notion and hope And too much encouraged I doubt my dear by the generality of our Sex  This brought on a more serious question or two You'll see by it what a creature an unmortified Libertine is  I asked him If he knew what he had said alluded to a sentence in the best of books  That there was more joy in heaven    He took the words out of my mouth  Over one sinner that repenteth than over ninetyandnine just persons which need no repentance  Luke xv The parable is concerning the Sheep not the Prodigal Son as Mr Lovelace erroneously imagines  were his words  Yes Madam I thought of it as soon as I said it but not before I have read the story of the Prodigal Son I'll assure you And one day when I am settled as I hope to be will write a dramatic piece on the subject I have at times had it in my head and you will be too ready perhaps to allow me to be qualified for it  You so lately Sir stumbled at a word with which you must be better acquainted ere you can be thoroughly master of such a subject that I am amazed you should know anything of the Scripture and be so ignorant of that  See Vol iii Edit i p Edit ii p    O Madam I have read the Bible as a fine piece of antient historyBut as I hope to be saved it has for some few years past made me so uneasy when I have popped upon some passages in it that I have been forced to run to music or company to divert myself  Poor wretch lifting up my hands and eyes  The denunciations come so slapdash upon one so unceremoniously as I may say without even the Byyourleave of a rude London chairman that they overturn one horse and man as St Paul was overturned There's another Scripture allusion Madam The light in short as his was is too glaring to be borne  O Sir do you want to be complimented into Repentance and Salvation  But pray Mr Lovelace do you mean anything at all when you swear so often as you do  By your Soul  or bind an asseveration with the words  As you hope to be saved  O my beloved creature shifting his seat let us call another cause  Why Sir don't  I  neither use  ceremony  enough with you  Dearest Madam forbear for the present I am but in my Noviciate Your foundation must be laid brick by brick You'll hinder the progress of the good work you would promote if you tumble in a whole waggonload at once upon me  Lord bless me thought I what a character is that of a LibertineWhat a creature am I who have risqued what I have risqued with such a oneWhat a task before me if my hopes continue of reforming  such a wild Indian as thisNay worse than a wild Indian for a man who errs with his eyes open and against conviction is a thousand times worse for what he knows and much harder to be reclaimed than if he had never known anything at all  I was equally shocked  at  him and concerned  for  him and having laid so few bricks to speak to his allusion and those so illcemented I was as willing as the gay Inconsiderate to call another cause as he termed itAnother cause too more immediately pressing upon me from my uncertain situation  I said  c  Vol  iii  Edit  i  p    l    on the words  to receive you  add the following Note  The Reader  This Note is inserted in Vol iii p of the d Edition  perhaps need not be reminded that he had

It is easy for me to perceive that my Charmer is more sullen when she receives and has perused a Letter from that vixen than at other times But as the sweet Maid shews even then more of  passive grief  than of  active spirit  I hope she is rather lamenting than plotting And indeed for what now should she plot when I am become a reformed man and am hourly improving in my moralsNevertheless I must contrive some way or other to get at their correspondenceOnly to see the turn of it that's all  But no attempt of this kind must be made yet A detected invasion in an article so sacred  c  Vol  iii

I am willing to think the best of my Father  See before p  "  he gives a description of her air and manner greatly to her advantage and says  I could hardly forbear taking her into my arms upon it in spite of an expected  tempest  So much wit so much beauty such a lively manner and such exceeding quickness and penetration O Belford she must be nobody's but mine I can now account for and justify Herod's command to destroy his Mariamne if he returned not alive from his Interview with Caesar For were I to know that it were but probable that any other man were to have this charming creature even after my death the very thought would be enough to provoke me to cut that man's throat were he a Prince  I may be deemed by this Lady a rapid a boisterous Loverand  she  may like me the less for it But all the Ladies I have met with till now loved to raise a tempest and to enjoy it Nor did they ever raise it but I enjoyed it tooLord send as once happily to London  Mr Lovelace gives the following account of his rude rapture when he seized her hand and put her by his  WILD  manner as she expresses it  Ibid p  into so much terror  Darkness and light I swore were convertible at her pleasure She could make any subject plausible  I was all error she all perfection And I snatched her hand and more than kissed it I was ready to devour it There was I believe a kind of phrensy in my manner which threw her into a panic like that of Semele perhaps when the Thunderer in all his majesty surrounded with ten thousand celestial burningglasses was about to scorch her into a cinder  HAD not my heart misgiven me and had I not just in time recollected that she was not so much in my power but that she might abandon me at her pleasure having more friends in that house than I had I should at that moment have made offers that would have decided all one way or otherBut apprehending that I had shewed too much meaning in my passion I gave it another turnBut little did the Charmer think what an escape either she or I had as the event might have proved from the sudden gust of passion which had like to have blown me into her arms She was born I told her to make me happy and to save a soul  He gives the rest of his vehement speech pretty nearly in the same words as the Lady gives them And then proceeds  I SAW she was frighted And she would have had Reason had the scene been London and that place in London which I have in view to carry her to She confirmed me in my apprehension that I had alarmed her too much She told me that she saw what my boasted regard to her Injunctions was and she would take proper measures upon it as I should soon find That she was shocked at my violent airs and if I hoped any favour from her I must that instant withdraw and leave her to her recollection  She pronounced this in such a manner as shewed she was set upon it and having stept out of the  gentle  the  polite  part I had so newly engaged to act  I thought a ready obedience was the best atonement And indeed I was sensible from her anger and repulses that I wanted time myself for recollection And so I withdrew with the same veneration as a petitioning subject would withdraw from the presence of his Sovereign But Oh Belford had she had but the least patience with meHad she but made me think that she would forgive this initiatory ardor Surely she will not be always thus guarded  I had not been a moment by myself but I was sensible that I had halfforfeited my newlyassumed character It is exceedingly difficult thou seest for an honest man to act in disguises As the Poet says  Thrust Nature back with a pitchfork it will return  I recollected that what she had insisted upon was really a part of that declared will before she left her Father's house to which in another case to humble her I had pretended to have an inviolable regard And when I remembred her words of  Taking her measures accordingly  I was resolved to sacrifice a leg or an arm to make all up again before she had time to determine upon any new measures  How seasonably to this purpose have come in my Aunt's and Cousin's Letters  I HAVE sent in again and again to implore her to admit me to her presence But she will conclude a Letter she is writing to Miss Howe before she will see meI suppose to give an account of what has just passed  CURSE upon her perverse tyranny How she makes me wait for an humble audience though she has done writing some time A Prince begging for her upon his knees should not prevail upon me to spare her if I can but get her to LondonOons Jack I believe I have bit my lip through for vexationBut one day  hers  shall smart for it  Mr Lovelace beginning a new date gives an account of his admittance and of the conversation that followed Which differing only in style from that the Lady gives in the next Letter is omitted  He collects  c  Vol  iii  Edit  i  p    l    after  have them to marry  insert  Nor upon second thoughts  This passage is inserted Vol iii p of the d Edition

insert  They really are every one of them your very great admirers And as for Lord M he is so much pleased with you and with the confidence as he calls it which you have reposed in his Nephew that he vows he will disinherit him if he reward it not as he ought You must take care that you lose not both families  I hear Mrs Norton is enjoined as she values the favour of the  other  family not to correspond either with you or with mePoor creaturesBut they are yourYet they are not your  Relations  neither I believe Had you had any other Nurse I should have concluded you had been changed I suffer by their low maliceExcuse me therefore  You really hold this man to his good behaviour with more spirit than I thought you mistress of especially when I judged of you by that meekness which you always contended for as the proper distinction of the female character and by the love which think as you please you certainly have for him You may rather be proud of than angry at the imputation since you are the only woman I ever knew read or  heard of whose love was so much governed by her prudence But once the indifference of the Husband takes place of the ardor of the Lover it will be  your  turn And if I am not mistaken this man who is the only selfadmirer I ever knew who was not a coxcomb will rather in his day expect homage than pay it  Your handsome Husbands my dear make a Wife's heart ake very often And tho' you are as fine a person of a woman at the least as he is of a man he will take too much delight in  himself  to think himself more indebted to your favour than you are to his distinction and preference of you But no man take your finer mind with your very fine person can deserve you So you must be contented should your merit be underrated since that  must  be so marry whom you will Perhaps you will think I indulge these sort of reflections against your Narcissus's of men to keep my Mother's choice for me of Hickman in countenance with myselfI don't know but there is something in it at least enough to have given birth to the reflection  I think there can  c  Vol  iii  Edit  i  p    l    and Edit  ii  p    l    after  anything of the matter  insert  We have all our Defects We have often regreted the particular Fault which tho' in venerable characters we must have been blind not to see  I remember what you once said to me and the caution was good Let us my Nancy were your words Let us who have not the same failings as those we censure guard against  other  and  greater  in ourselves Nevertheless I must needs tell you that my Mother has vexed me a little very lately by some instances of her jealous narrowness I will mention one of them tho' I did not intend it She wanted to borrow Thirty Guineas of me  only  while she got  a Note changed I said I could lend her but Eight or Ten Eight or Ten would not do She thought I was much richer I could have told her I was much cunninger than to let her know my Stock which on a Review I find Ninetyfive Guineas and all of them most heartily at your service  I believe your Uncle Tony put her upon this wise project for she was  out of cash  in an hour after he left her If he did you will judge that they intend to distress you If it will provoke  you  to demand your own in a legal way I wish they would since their putting you upon that course will justify the necessity of your leaving them And as it is not for your credit to own that you were tricked away contrary to your intention this would afford a reason for your going off that I should make very good use of You'll see that I approve of Lovelace's advice upon this subject I am not willing to allow the weight to your answer to him on that head which perhaps  ought  to be allowed it  See Vol iii Edit i p and Edit ii p    You must be the less surprised at the inventions of this man because of his uncommon talents Whatever he had turned his head to he would have excelled in or been or done things extraordinary He is said to be revengeful A very bad quality I believe indeed he is a devil in everything but his footThis therefore is my repeated advice Provoke him not too much against yourself But unchain him and let him loose upon your Sister's vile Betty and your Brother's Joseph Leman This is resenting  low  But I know to whom I write or else I would go a good deal  higher  I'll assure you  Your next I suppose  c  Vol

follows Vol iii p of the d Edition    May it plese your Honner  Sat Apr    THIS is to let your Honner kno' as how I have been emploied in a bisness I would have been excused from if so be I could For it is to gitt evidense from a young man who is of late com'd out to be my Cuzzen by my Granmother's side and but lately come to live in these partes about a verry vile thing as younge master calls it relating to your Honner God forbid I should call it so without your leafe It is not for so plane a man as I be to tacks  my betters It is consarning one Miss Batirton of Notingam a very pritty crature belike  Your Honner got her away it seems by a false Letter to her macking believe as howe her Shecuzzen that she derely loved was coming to see her and was tacken ill upon the rode And so Miss Batirton set out in a Shase and one sarvant to fet her Cuzzen from the Inne where she laid sick as she thote And the sarvant was tricked and braute back the Shase but Miss Batirton was not harde of for a month or so And when it came to passe that her frends found her oute and would have prossekutid your Honner your Honner was gone abroad And so she was broute to bed as one may say before your Honner's return And she got colde in her lyininn and lanquitched and soon died And the child is living but your Honner never troubles your Honner's hedd about it in the least And this and some such other matters of verry bad reporte Squier Solmes was to tell my young Lady of if so be she would have harde him speke before we lost her sweet company as I may say from heere  See Vol ii Edit i p Edit ii p    I hope your Honner will excuse me But I was forsed to tell all I harde because they had my Cuzzen in to them and he would have said he had tolde me So could not be melelymouthed for fere to be blone up and plese your Honner  Your Honner helped me to a many ugly stories to tell against your Honner to my younge Master and younge Mistriss butt did not tell me about this  I most humbelly

plesed to tell me if as how there be any danger to your Honner's life from this bisness for my Cuzzen is actlie hier'd to go down to Miss Batirton's frendes to see if they will stur in it For you must kno' your Honner as how he lived in the Batirton family at the time and could be a good evidense and all that  I hope it was not so verry bad as Titus says it was for hee ses as how there was a Rape in the case betwixt you at furste and plese your Honner and my Cuzzen Titus is a very honist younge man as ever brocke bred This is his carackter and this made me willinger to owne him for my Relation when we came to talck  If there should be danger of your Honner's life I hope your Honner will not be hanged like as one of us common men Only have your hedd cut off or so And yet it is pitty such a hedd should be lossed But if as how it shoulde be prossekutid to that furr which God forbid be plesed natheless to thinck of youre fethful Joseph Leman before your hedd be condemned for after condemnation as I have been told all will be the King's or the Shreeve's  I thote as how it was best to acquent your Honner of this and for you to let me kno' if I could do anything to sarve your Honner and prevent mischef with my Cuzzen Titus on his coming back from Nottingam before he mackes his reporte  I have gin him a hinte already For what as I sed to him Cuzzin Titus signifies stirring up the coles and macking of strief to make rich gentilfolkes live at varience and to be cutting of throtes and suchlike  Verry trewe sed little Titus And this and plese your Honner gis me hopes of him if so be your Honner gis me directions sen' as God kno'es I have a poor a verry poor invenshon only a willing mind  to prevent mischef that is the chief of my aim and always was I bless my GodEls I could have made mutch mischef in my time as indeed any sarvant may Your Honner natheless praises my invenshon every nowandthen Alas and plese your Honner what invenshon should suche a plane man as I have But when your Honner sets me agoing by  your  fine invenshon I can do well enuff And I am sure I have a hearty good will to deserve your Honner's faver if I mought  Two days as I may say off and on have I been writing this long Letter And yet I have not sed all I would say For be it knone unto your Honner as how I do not like that Capten Singelton which I told you of  in my two last Letters  He is always laying his hedd and my young Master's hedd together and I suspect much if so be some mischef is not going on between them And still the more as because my eldest young Lady semes to be joined to them sometimes  Last week my young master sed before my fase  My harte's blood boiles over Capten Singelton for revenge upon this  And he called your Honner by a name it is not for such a won as me to say what Capten Singelton whispred my younge Master being I was by So younge Master sed  You may say anything before Joseph for althoff he looks so seellie he has as good a harte and as good a hedd as any sarvante in the worlde nede to have  My conscience touched me just then But why shoulde it when all I do is to prevente mischeff and seing your Honner has so much patience which younge Master has not so am not affeard of telling your Honner anything whatsomever  And furthermore I have suche a desire to desarve your Honner's bounty to me as mackes me let nothing pass I can tell you of to prevent harm And too besides your Honner's goodness about the Blew  Bore which I have so good an accounte ofI am sure I shall be bounden to bless your Honner the longest day I have to live  And then the Blew Bore is not all neither sen' and plese your Honner the pretty Sowe God forgive me for gesting in so serus a matter runs in my hedd likewise I believe I shall love her mayhap more than your Honner would have me for she begins to be kind and goodhumered and listens and plese your Honner licke as  if she was among beans  when I talke about the Blew Bore and all that  Prayey your Honner forgive the gesting of a poor plane man We common fokes have our joys and plese your Honner lick as our betters have and if we be sometimes snubbed we can find our underlings to snub them agen And if not we can get a Wife mayhap and snub her So are Masters some how or other oursells  But how I try your Honner's patienceSarvants will show their joiful hartes tho'ff but in partinens when encouredg'd  Be plesed from the prems's to let me kno' if as how I can be put upon any sarvice to sarve your Honner and to sarve my deerest younge Lady which God grant For I begin to be affearde for her hearing what pepel talckTo be sure your Honner will not do her no  harme  as a man may say But I kno' your Honner must be good to so wonderous a younge Lady How can you help itBut heere my conscience smites me that  but for some of my stories which your Honner taute me my old Master and my old Lady and the two old Squiers would not have been abell to be half so hardharted as they be for all what my young Master and young Mistress sayes    And here is the sad thing they cannot come to clere up matters with my deerest young Lady because as  your Honner has ordered it  they have these stories as if bribed by me out of your Honner's sarvant  which must not be known for fere you should kill'n and me too and blacken the briberAh your HonnerI doute as that I am a very vild fellow Lord

of reppentance hereafter being but a younge man if I do wrong thro' ignorrens your Honner being a grate man and a grate wit and I a poor crature not worthy notice and your Honner able to answer for all But howsomever I am  Your Honner's fethful Sarvant in all dewtie  JOSEPH LEMAN  April    and    Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOSEPH LEMAN    Monday April    Honest Joseph  YOU have a worse opinion of your invention than you ought to have I must praise it again Of a plain man's head I have not known many better than yours How often have your forecast and discretion answered my wishes in cases which I could not foresee not knowing how my general directions would succeed or what might happen in the execution of them You are too doubtful of your own abilities honest Joseph that's your fault But it being a fault that is owing to natural  modesty  you ought rather to be  pitied  for it than  blamed    The affair of Miss Betterton was a youthful frolick I love dearly to exercise my invention I do  assure you Joseph that I have ever had more pleasure in my Contrivances than in the End of them I am no sensual man but a man of spiritOne woman is like another  You understand me Joseph  In Coursing all the sport is made by the winding Hare A barndoor Chick is better eating  Now you take me Joseph  Miss Betterton was but a Tradesman's daughter The family indeed were grown rich and aimed at a new Line of Gentry and were unreasonable enough to expect a man of my family would marry her I was honest I gave the young Lady no hope of that for she put it to me She resented Kept up and was kept up A little innocent Contrivance was necessary to get her outBut no Rape in the case I assure you JosephShe loved me I loved her Indeed when I got her to the Inn I asked her no questions It is cruel to ask a modest woman for her consent It is creating difficulties to both Had not her friends been officious I had been constant and faithful to her to this day as far as I knowFor then I had not known my Angel  I went not abroad upon  her  account She loved me too well to have appeared against me She refused to sign a paper they had drawn up for her to found a prosecution upon And the brutal creatures would not permit the midwife's assistance till her life was in danger and I believe to this her death was owing  I went into mourning for her tho' abroad at the time A distinction I have ever paid to those worthy creatures who died in Childbed by me  I was ever nice in my Loves These were the rules I laid down to myself on my entrance into active life To set the mother above want if her friends were cruel and if I could not get her an husband worthy of her To shun common women A piece of justice I owed to innocent Ladies as well as to myself To marry off a former mistress if possible  before I took to a new one To maintain a Lady handsomely in her lyingin To provide for the Little one if it lived according to the degree of its mother To go into mourning for the mother if she died And the promise of this was a great comfort to the pretty dears as they grew near their times  All my errors all my expences have been with and upon women So I could acquit my conscience acting thus honourably by them as well as my discretion as to point of fortune  All men love women And find me a man of more honour in these points if you can Joseph  No wonder the Sex love me as they do  But  now  I am strictly virtuous I am reformed So I have been for a long long time Resolving to marry as soon as I can prevail upon the most admirable of women to have me I think of nobody else It is impossible I should I have spared very pretty girls for her sake Very true Joseph So set your honest heart at restYou see the pains I take to satisfy your qualms  But as to Miss BettertonNo Rape in the case I repeat Rapes are unnatural things And more  rare  than are imagined JosephI should be loth to be put to such a streight I never was Miss Betterton was taken from me against her own will In that case her friends not I committed the Rape  I have contrived to see the Boy twice unknown to the Aunt who takes care of him loves him and would not now part with him on any consideration The Boy is a fine Boy I thank God No Father need be ashamed of him He will be well provided for If not I would take care of him He will have his Mother's fortune They curse the Father ungrateful wretches but bless the BoyUpon the whole there is nothing vile in this matter on my side a great deal on the Bettertons  Wherefore Joseph be not thou in pain either  for  my  head or for  thy own  neck nor for the Blue Boar nor for thy pretty Sow  I love your jesting Jesting better becomes a poor man than qualmsI love to have you jest All we say all we do all we wish for is a jest He that makes life itself not so is a sad fellow and has the worst of it  I doubt not Joseph but you have had your joys as you say as well as your betters May you have more and more honest JosephHe that grudges a poor man joy ought to have none himself Jest on therefore Jesting I repeat better becomes thee than qualms  I had no  need  to tell you of Miss Betterton Did I not furnish you with stories enough without hers against myself to augment your credit with your cunning masters Besides I was loth to mention Miss Betterton her friends being all living and in credit I loved her too for she was taken from me by her cruel friends while our joys were young  But enough of dear Miss Betterton  Dear  I say for death  endears  Rest to her worthy soulThere Joseph off went a deep sigh to the memory of Miss Betterton  As to the journey of little Titus I now recollect the fellow by his name Let that take its course A Lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago no process begun in her lifetime refusing herself to give evidence against me whilst she livedPretty circumstances to found an indictment for a Rape upon  As to your young Lady the everadorable Miss Clarissa Harlowe I always courted her for a Wife Others rather expected marriage from the vanity of their own hearts than from my promises For I was always careful of what I promised You know Joseph that I have gone beyond my promises to  you  I do to everybody And why Because it is the best way of shewing that I have no grudging or narrow  spirit A promise is an obligation  A just man will keep his promise A generous man will go beyond it  This is my rule  If you doubt my honour to your young Lady it is more than she does She would not stay with me an hour if she did Mine is the steadiest heart in the world Hast thou not reason to think it soWhy this squeamishness then honest Joseph  But it is because thou  art  honest So I forgive thee Whoever loves my divine Clarissa loves me  Let James Harlowe call me what Names he will For his Sister's sake I will bear them Do not be concerned for me Her favour will make me rich amends His own vilely malicious heart will make his blood  boil over  at any time And when it does thinkest thou that I will let it touch my conscience And if not  mine  why should it touch  thine  Ah Joseph Joseph What a foolish teazer is thy conscience Such a conscience as gives a plain man trouble when he intends to do for the best is weakness not conscience  But say what thou wilt write all thou knowest or hearest of to me Ill have patience with everybody Why should I not when it is as much the desire of my heart as it is of thine to prevent mischief  So now Joseph having taken all this pains to satisfy thy Conscience and answer all thy doubts and to banish all thy fears let me come to a  new point    Your endeavours and mine which were designed  by roundabout ways  to reconcile all even against the wills of the most obstinate have not we see answered the end we hoped they would answer but on the contrary have widened the unhappy differences between our families But this has not been either your fault or mine It is owing to the black pitchlike blood of your venomoushearted young Master  boiling over  as he owns that our honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated  Yet we must proceed in the same course We shall tire them out in time and they will propose terms and when they do they shall find how reasonable mine shall be little as they deserve from me  Persevere therefore Joseph honest Joseph persevere and unlikely as you may imagine the means our desires will be at last obtained  We have nothing for it now but to go thro' with our work in the way we have begun For since as I told you in my last my Beloved mistrusts you she will blow you up if she be  not  mine If she  be  I can and will protect you and as if there will be any fault in her opinion it will be rather mine than yours she  must  forgive you and keep her husband' secrets for the sake of his reputation Else she will be guilty of a great failure in her duty So now you have set your hand to the plough Joseph there is no looking back  And what is the consequence of all this One labour more and that will be all that will fall to your lot at least of consequence  My beloved is resolved not to think of Marriage till she has tried to move her friends to a Reconciliation with her You know they are determined not to be reconciled She has it in her head I doubt not to make me submit to the people I hate and if I did they would rather insult me than receive my condescension as they ought She even owns that she will renounce me if they insist upon it provided they will give up Solmes So to all appearance I am still as far as ever from the happiness of calling her mine Indeed I am more likely than ever to lose her if I cannot contrive some way to avail myself of the present critical situation and then Joseph all I have been studying and all you have been doing will signify nothing  At the place where we are we cannot long be private The lodgings are inconvenient for us while  both together and while the refuses to marry She wants to get me at a distance from her There are extraordinary convenient lodgings in my eye in London where we could be private and all mischief avoided When  there  if I  get  her thither she will insist that I shall leave her Miss Howe is for ever putting her upon contrivances That you know is the reason I have been obliged by your means to play the family off at HarlowePlace upon Mrs Howe and Mrs Howe upon her DaughterAh Joseph Little need for your fears for my Angel  I  only am in dangerBut were I the free liver I am reported to be all this could I get over with a wet finger as the saying is  But by the help of one of your hints I have thought of an Expedient which will do everything and raise your reputation tho' already so high higher still This Singleton I hear is a fellow who loves enterprising The view he has to get James Harlowe to be his

violent and unyielding You two might indeed have raqueted the Ball betwixt you as you say But Mr Hickman by his gentle manners  seems formed for you if you go not too far with him If you do it would be a tameness in him to bear it which would make a man more contemptible than Mr Hickman can ever deserve to be made Nor is it a disgrace for even a brave man who knows what a woman is to vow to him  afterwards  to be very obsequious  beforehand    Do you think it is to the credit of Mr Lovelace's character that he can be offensive and violent Does he not as all such spirits must subject himself to the necessity of making submissions for his excesses far more mortifying to a proud heart than those condescensions which the highspirited are so apt to impute as a weakness of mind in such a man as Mr Hickman  Let me tell you my dear that Mr Hickman is such a one as would rather bear an affront  from  a Lady than offer one  to  her He had rather I dare say that she should have occasion to ask  his  pardon than he  hers  But my dear  you have outlived your first passion  and had the second man been an angel he would not have been more than indifferent to you  My motives for suspending  c

And of her urging his absence from the safety she was in from the situation of the house except she were to be traced out by his visits  I was confoundedly puzzled  says he  on this occasion and on her insisting upon the execution of a tooready offer which I made her to go down to Berks to bring up my Cousin Charlotte to visit and attend her I made miserable excuses and fearing that they would be mortally resented as her passion began to rise upon my saying Charlotte was delicate which she took strangely wrong I was obliged to screen myself behind the most solemn and explicit declarations  He then repeats those declarations to the same effect with the account she gives of them  I began  says he  with an intention to keep my Life of Honour in view in the declarations I made her but as it has been said of a certain orator in the House of Commons who more than once in a long speech convinced himself as he went along and concluded against the side he set out intending to favour so I in earnest pressed without reserve for Matrimony in the progress of my harangue which state I little thought of urging upon her with so much strength and explicitness  He then values himself upon the delay that his proposal of taking and furnishing a house must occasion  He wavers in his resolutions whether to act honourably or not by a merit so exalted  He values himself upon his own delicacy in expressing his indignation against her friends for supposing what he pretends his heart rises against them for presuming to suppose  But have I not reason  says he  to be angry with her for not praising me for this my delicacy when she  is so ready to call me to account for the least failure in punctilio However I believe I can excuse her too upon this generous consideration For  generous  I

Collateral credit in that to the Old one  Whence she always calls Mrs Sinclair  Mamma  tho' not succeeding to the trust  She is just come to pass a day or two and then to return to her surviving guardian's at Barnet  Miss Partington has suitors a little hundred her Grandmother an Alderman's Dowager having left her a great additional fortune and is not trusted out of her guardians house

wisdom to keep thy brothervarlets from blundering for as thou must have observed from what I have written we have the most watchful and most penetrating Lady in the world to deal with A Lady worth deceiving But whose eyes will pierce to the bottom of your shallow souls the moment she hears you open Do thou therefore place thyself between Mowbray and Tourville Their toes to be played upon and commanded by thine if they go wrong Thy elbows to be the ministers of approbation  As to your general behaviour No hypocrisy I hate it So does my Charmer If I had studied  for it I believe I  could  have been an hypocrite But my general character is so well known that I should have been suspected at once had I aimed at making myself too white But what necessity can there be for hypocrisy unless the generality of the Sex were to  refuse  us for our immoralities The best of them love to have the credit of reforming us Let the sweet souls try for it If they fail their intent was good That will be a consolation to them And as to  us  our work will be the easier our sins the fewer Since they will draw themselves in with a very little of our help and we shall save a parcel of cursed Falshoods and appear to be what we  are  both to Angels and Men Mean time their very Grandmothers will acquit us and reproach them with their  Selfdo Selfhave  and as having  erred against knowlege  and ventured against  manifest appearances  What folly therefore for men of our character to be hypocrites  Be sure to instruct the rest and do thou thyself remember not to talk obscenely You know I never permitted any of you to talk obscenely Time enough for that when ye grow old and can ONLY talk Besides ye must consider Prisc's  affected  character my Goddess's  real  one Far from obscenity therefore do not so much as touch upon the double Entendre What as I have often said cannot you touch a Lady's heart without wounding her ear  It is  necessary  that ye should appear worse men than myself You cannot help appearing so you'll say Well then there will be the less restraint upon youThe less restraint the less affectationAnd if Belton begins his favourite subject in behalf of  keeping  it may make me take upon myself to oppose him But fear not I shall not give the argument all my force  She must have some curiosity I think to see what sort of men my companions are She will not expect any of you to be saints Are ye not men born to  considerable fortunes altho' ye are not all of ye men of parts Who is it in this mortal life that  wealth does not mislead  And as it gives people the  power of being mischievous  does it not require great virtue to forbear the use of that power Is not the devil said to be the god of this world Are we not children of this world Well

laid her under a necessity to deny or comply with the urgent request of so fine a young Lady who had engaged to honour me at my Collation on condition that my Beloved would be present at it  To be obliged to appear before my friends as what she was not She was for insisting that I should acquaint the women here with the truth of the matter and not go on propagating stories for her to countenance making her a sharer in my guilt  But what points will not perseverance carry especially when it is covered over with the face of yielding now and Parthianlike returning to the charge anon Do not the Sex carry all their points with their men by the same methods Have I conversed with them so freely as I have done and learnt nothing of them Didst thou ever know that a woman's denial of

CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Sunday April    MR Lovelace in his last Letters having taken notice of the most material passages contained in this Letter the following Extracts from it are only inserted  She gives pretty near the same account that he does of what passed between them on her resolution to go to church and of his proposal of St Paul's and desire of attending her She praises his good behaviour there as also the discourse and the preacher Is pleased with its seasonableness Gives particulars of the conversation between them afterwards and commends the good observations he makes upon the sermon  I am willing  says she  to have hopes of him But am so unable to know how to depend upon his seriousness for an hour together that all my favourable accounts of him in this respect must be taken with allowance  Being very much pressed I could not tell how to refuse dining with the Widow and her Nieces this day I am better pleased with them than I ever thought I should be I cannot help blaming myself for my readiness to give severe censures where reputation is concerned Peoples ways humours constitutions education and opportunities allowed for my dear many persons as far as I know may appear blameless whom others of different humours and educations are  too apt to blame and who from the same fault may be as ready to blame  them  I will therefore make it a rule to myself for the future never to judge peremptorily on first appearances But yet I must observe that these are not people I should chuse to be intimate with or whose ways I can like Altho' for the stations they are in they may go thro' the world with tolerable credit  Mr Lovelace's behaviour has been such as makes me call this so far as it is passed an agreeable day Yet when easiest as to him my situation with my friends takes place in my thoughts and causes me many a tear  I am the more pleased with the people of the house because of the persons of rank they are acquainted with and who visit them  Sunday Evening  I AM still well pleased with Mr Lovelace's behaviour We have had a good deal of serious discourse together The man has really just and good notions He confesses how much he is pleased with this day and hopes for many such Nevertheless he ingenuously warned me that his unlucky vivacity might return But he doubted not that he should be fixed at last by my example and conversation  He has given me an entertaining account of the four gentlemen he is to meet tomorrow night  Entertaining  I mean for his humorous description of their persons manners  c  but such a description as is far from being to their praise Yet he seemed rather to design to divert my melancholy it than to degrade them I think at bottom my dear that he must be a goodnatured man but that he was spoiled young for want of check or controul  I cannot but call this my circumstances considered an happy day to the end of it Indeed my dear I think I could prefer him to all the men I ever knew were he but to be always what he has been this day  You see how ready I am to own all you have charged me with when I find myself out It is a difficult thing I believe sometimes for a young creature that is able to deliberate with herself to know when she loves or when she hates But I am resolved as much as possible to be determined both in my hatred and love by  actions  as  they  make the man worthy or unworthy  She dates again on Monday and declares herself highly displeased  c  Vol  iii  Edit  i  p    l    after  than a Lady dele  the next Paragraph and read  To pursue the comparison  This passage is inserted Vol iii p of the d Edit  If the disappointment of the captivated Lady be very great she will threaten indeed as I said She will even refuse her sustenance for some time especially if you entreat her much and she thinks she gives you concern by her refusal But then the Stomach of the dear sullen one will soon return 'Tis pretty to see how she comes to by degrees Pressed by appetite she will first steal perhaps a weeping morsel by herself then be brought to piddle and sigh and sigh and piddle before you nowandthen if her viands be unsavoury swallowing with them a relishing tear or two Then she comes to eat and drink to oblige you Then resolves to live for your sake Her exclamations will in the next place be turned into blandishments her vehement upbraidings into gentle murmuringsHow  dare  you Traitorinto How  could  you dearest She will draw you to her instead of pushing you from her No longer with unsheathed claws will she resist you but like a pretty playful wanton Kitten with gentle paws and concealed talons tap your cheek and with intermingled smiles and tears and caresses implore your consideration for her and your  constancy  All the favour she then  has to ask of youAnd this is the time were it given to man to confine himself to one object to be happier every day than other  Now Belford were I to go no farther than I have gone with my beloved Miss Harlowe how shall I know the difference between  her  and  another  bird To let her fly now what a pretty jest would that be How do I know except I try whether she may not be brought to sing me a fine song and to be as well contented as I have brought other birds to be and very shy ones too  But now let us reflect a little upon the confounded partiality of us human creatures I can give two or three familiar and if they were  not familiar  they would be  shocking  instances of the cruelty both of men and women with respect to other creatures perhaps as worthy as at least more innocent than themselves By my Soul Jack there is more of the Savage in human nature than we are commonly aware of Nor is it after all so much amiss that we sometimes avenge the more innocent animals upon our own species  To particulars  How usual a thing is it for women as well as men without the least remorse to ensnare to cage and torment and even with burning knittingneedles to put out the eyes of the poor feather'd songster Thou seest I have not yet done with birds which however in proportion to its bulk has more life than themselves for a bird is all soul and of consequence has as much feeling as the human creature When at the same time if an honest fellow by the gentlest persuasion and the softest arts has the good luck to prevail upon a mew'dup lady to countenance her own escape and she consents to break cage and be set a flying into the allchearing air of liberty Mercy on us what an Outcry is generally raised against him  Just like what you and I once saw raised in a paltry  village near Chelmsford after a poor hungry fox who watching his opportunity had seized by the neck and shouldered a sleekfeathered goose At what time we beheld the whole vicinage of boys and girls old men and old women all the furrows and wrinkles of the latter filled up with malice for the time the old men armed with prongs pitchforks clubs and catsticks the old women with mops brooms fireshovels tongs and pokers and the younger fry with dirt stones and brickbats gathering as they ran like a snowball in pursuit of the windoutstripping prowler all the mongrel curs of the  circumjacencies  yelp yelp yelp at their heels completing the horrid chorus  Remembrest thou not this scene Surely thou must My imagination inflamed by a tender sympathy for the danger of the adventurous marauder represents it to my eye as if it were but yesterday And dost thou not recollect how generously glad we were as if our own case that honest Reynard by the help of a lucky stile over which both old and young tumbled upon one another and a winding course escaped their brutal fury and flying catsticks and how in fancy we followed him to his undiscovered retreat and imagined we beheld the intrepid thief enjoying his dearearned purchase with a delight proportioned to his past danger  I once made a charming little savage severely repent the delight she took in seeing her tabby favourite make cruel sport with a pretty sleek beadeyed mouse before she devoured it Egad my Love said I to myself as I sat meditating the scene I am determined to lie in wait for a fit opportunity to try how  thou  wilt like to be tost over  my  head and be caught again How  thou  wilt like to be patted from me and pulled to me Yet will I rather give life than take it away as this barbarous quadrupede has at last done by her prey And after all was over between my girl and  me I reminded her of the incident to which my resolution was owing  Nor had I at another time any mercy upon the daughter of an old Epicure who had taught the girl without the least remorse to roast Lobsters alive to cause a poor Pig to be whipt to death to scrape Carp the contrary way of the scales making them leap in the stewpan and dressing them in their own blood for sawce And this for luxurysake and to provoke an appetite which I had without stimulation in my way and that I can tell thee a very ravenous one  Many more instances of the like nature could I give were I to leave nothing to thyself to shew that the best take the same liberties and perhaps worse with some sort of creatures that we take with others all  creatures  still and creatures too as I have observed above replete with strong life and sensible feeling If therefore people pretend to mercy let mercy go thro' all their actions I have read somewhere  That a merciful man is merciful to his beast    So much at present for those parts of thy Letter in which thou urgest to me motives of compassion for the Lady  But I guess at thy

man she had to deal with  For altho' she could not be supposed to know so much of his designs as the Reader does by means of his Letters to Belford yet she was but too well convinced of his faulty morals and of the necessity there was from the whole of his behaviour to her to keep such an encroacher as she frequently calls him at a distance In Vol  iii  Edit  i  p    Edit  ii  p    the Reader

Example  and therefore in her trials and distresses must not be allowed to dispense with those Rules which perhaps some others of her Sex in her delicate situation would not have thought themselves so

neglected education as it is matter of so much regret to  herself  Else there would not be much in it as the Low and Illiterate are the most useful people in the commonwealth since such constitute the labouring part of the public and as a Lettered Education but too generally sets people above those servile offices by which the business of the world is carried on Nor have I any doubt that there are take the world thro' twenty happy people among the Unlettered to one among those who have had a School Education  This however concludes not against Learning or  Letters since one would wish to lift to some little distinction and more genteel usefulness those who have capacity and whose Parentage one respects or whose services one would wish to reward  Were my mind quite at ease I could enlarge perhaps not unusefully upon this subject for I have considered it with as much attention as my years and little experience and observation will permit  But the extreme illiterateness and indocility of this maid are surprising considering that she wants not inquisitiveness appears willing to learn and in other respects has quick parts This confirms to me what I have heard remarked That there is a  docible Season  a Learningtime as I may say for every person in which the mind may be led step by step from the lower to the higher year by year to improvement How industriously ought these Seasons as they offer to be taken hold of by Tutors Parents and other friends to whom the cultivation of the genius of children and youth is committed since once elapsed and no foundation laid they hardly ever return And yet it must be confessed that there are some genius's which like some fruits ripen not till late And Industry and Perseverance will do prodigious thingsBut for a learner to have those first rudiments to master at twenty years of age suppose which others are taught and they themselves might have attained at ten what an uphill labour  These kind of observations you have always wished me to intersperse as they arise to my thoughts But it is a sign that my prospects are a little mended or I should not among so many more interesting ones that my mind has been of late filled with have had heart'sease enough to make them  Let me give you my  reflections  on my more hopeful prospects  I am now in the first place better able to account for the delays about the house than I was before  Poor Mrs FretchvilleTho' I know her not I pity herNext it looks well that he had apprised the women before this conversation with them of his intention to stay in this house after I was removed to the other By the tone of his voice he seemed concerned for the appearance this new delay would have with me  So handsomely did Miss Martin express herself of me that I am sorry methinks that I judged so hardly of her when I first came hitherFree people may go a great way but not all the way And as such are generally unguarded precipitate and thoughtless the same quickness changeableness and  suddenness  of spirit as I may call it may intervene if the heart be not corrupted to recover them to thought and duty  His reason for declining to go in person to bring up the Ladies of his family while my Brother and Singleton continue their machinations carries no bad face with it and one may the rather allow for  their  expectations that so proud a spirit as his should attend them for this purpose as he speaks of them sometimes as persons of punctilio  Other reasons I will mention for my being easier in my mind than I was before I overheard this conversation  Such as the advice he has received in relation to Singleton's mate which agrees but too well with what you my dear wrote to me in yours of May the th  His not intending to acquaint  me  with it  His cautions to the servants about the sailor if he should come and make enquiries about us  His resolution to avoid violence were he to fall in either with my Brother or this Singleton and the easy method he has chalked out in this case to prevent mischief since I need only  not to deny  my being his But yet I should be exceedingly unhappy in my  own opinion to be driven into such a tacit acknowlegement to any new persons till I am so altho' I have been led so much against my liking to give countenance to the belief of the persons below that we are married  I think myself obliged from what passed between Mr Lovelace and me on Wednesday and from what I overheard him say to consent to go with him to the Play and the rather as he had the discretion to propose one of the Nieces to accompany me  I cannot but acknowlege that I am pleased to find that he has actually written to Lord M  I have promised to give Mr Lovelace an answer to his proposals as soon as I have heard from you my dear on the subject  I hope that in my next Letter I shall have reason to confirm these favourable appearances Favourable I must think them in the wreck I have suffered  I hope that in the trial which you hint may happen between  me  and  myself  as you  See before p  express it if he should so behave as to oblige me to leave him I shall be able to act in such a manner as to bring no discredit upon myself in your eye and that is all now that I have to wish for But if I value him so much as you are pleased to suppose I do the trial which you imagine will be so difficult to me will not I conceive be upon getting from him when the means to effect my escape are lent me but how I shall behave when got from him and if like the Israelites of old I shall be so weak as to wish to return to my Egyptian bondage  I think it will not be amiss notwithstanding the present favourable appearances that you should perfect the scheme whatever it be which you tell me you have thought of in order to procure for me an asylum in case of necessity Mr Lovelace is certainly a deep and dangerous man and it is therefore but prudence  to be watchful and to be provided against the worst Lord bless me my dear how am I reducedCould I ever have thought to be in such a situation as to be obliged to stay with a man of whose honour by me I could have but the  shadow  of a doubtBut I will look forward and hope the best  I am certain that your Letters are safeBe perfectly easy therefore on that head  Mr Lovelace will never be out of my company by his goodwill otherwise I have no doubt that I am mistress of my

look into herself and endeavour to detect herself who from such an high Reputation left to proud and presumptuous Self should by one thoughtless step be brought to the dreadful situation I am in  Let me however look forward To despond would be to add sin to sin And whom have I to raise me up whom to comfort me if I desert  myself  Thou O Father who I hope hast not yet deserted hast not yet cursed

BELFORD  Esq  AND now that my Beloved seems secure in my net for my project upon the vixen Miss Howe and upon her Mother In which the officious prancer Hickman is to come in for a dash  But why upon her Mother methinks thou askest who unknown to herself has only acted by thy impulse thro' thy agent Joseph Leman upon the folly of old Tony the Uncle  No matter for that She believes she acts upon her own judgment and deserves to be punished for pretending to judgment when she has noneEvery living soul but myself I can tell thee shall be punished that treats either cruelly or disrespectfully so adored a LadyWhat a plague is it not enough that she is teazed and tormented in person by me  I have already broken the matter to our three confederates as a  supposed  not a  resolvedon  case indeed And yet they know that with me in a piece of mischief Execution with its swiftest feet is seldom three paces behind Projection which hardly ever limps neither  MOWBRAY is not against it It is a scheme he says worthy of us And we have not done anything for a good while that has made a noise  BELTON indeed hesitates a little because matters go wrong between him and his Thomasine and the poor fellow has not the courage to have his sore place probed to the bottom  TOURVILLE has started a fresh game and shrugs his shoulders and should not  chuse  to go abroad at present  if I please  For I apprehend that from the  nature  of the project there will be a kind of necessity to travel till all is blown over  TO ME one country is as good as another and I shall soon I suppose chuse to quit this paltry Island except the mistress of my fate will consent to cohabit at  home  and so lay me under no necessity of  surprising her into foreign parts  TRAVELLING thou knowest gives the Sexes charming opportunities of being familiar with one another A very few days and nights must now decide all matters betwixt me and my fair Inimitable  DOLEMAN who can act in these causes only as chambercounsel will inform us by pen and ink his right hand and right side having not yet been struck and the other side beginning to be sensible of all that shall occur in our absence  As for THEE we had rather have thy company than not for altho' thou art a wretched fellow at contrivance yet art thou intrepid at execution But as thy present engagements make thy attendance uncertain I am not for making thy part necessary to our scheme but for leaving thee to come after us when abroad I know thou canst not long live without us  The project in short is thisMrs Howe has an elder Sister in the Isle of Wight who is lately a widow and I am well informed that the Mother and Daughter have engaged before the latter is married to pay a visit to this Lady who is rich and intends Miss for her heiress and in the interim will make her some valuable presents on her approaching Nuptials which as Mrs Howe who loves money more than anything but herself told one of my acquaintance would be  worth fetching    Now Jack nothing more need be done than to hire a little trim vessel which shall sail a pleasuring backward and forward to Portsmouth Spithead and the Isle of Wight for a week or fortnight before we enter upon our parts of the plot And as Mrs Howe will be for making the best bargain she can for her passage the master of the vessel may have orders as a  perquisite allowed him by his owners to take what she will give And the Master's name be it what it will shall be  Ganmore  on the occasion for I know a rogue of that name who is not obliged to be of any country any more than we  Well then we will imagine them on board I will be there in disguise They know not any of ye foursupposing the scheme so inviting that thou canst be one  'Tis plaguy hard if we cannot  find  or  make  a storm  Perhaps they will be seasick But whether they be or not no doubt they will keep their Cabin  Here will be Mrs Howe Miss Howe Mr Hickman a Maid and a Footman I suppose and thus we will order it  I know it will be hard weather I  know  it will And before there can be the least suspicion of the matter we shall be in sight of Guernsey Jersey Dieppe Cherbourg or anywhither on the French coast that it shall please us to agree with the winds to blow us And then securing the footman and the women being separated one of us according to lots that may be cast shall overcome either by persuasion or force the maidservant That will be no hard task and she is a likely wench I have seen her often One Mrs Howe nor can there be much difficulty there for she is full of health and life and has been long a Widow Another  That  says the princely Lion must be  I  the saucy Daughter who will be too much frighted to make great resistance  Violent  spirits in that Sex are seldom  true  spirits'Tis but where they  can  And after beating about the coast for three or four days for recreation's sake and to make sure work and till we see our sullen birds begin to eat and sip we will set them all ashore where it will be most convenient sell the vessel To Mrs Townsend's agents with all my heart or to some other  Smugglers or give it to Ganmore and pursue our travels and tarry abroad till all is hushed up  Now I know thou wilt make difficulties as it is thy way while it is mine to conquer them My other vassals made theirs and I condescended to obviate them As thus I will thine first stating them for thee according to what I know of thy phlegm  What in the first place wilt thou ask shall be done with Hickman who will be in full parade of dress and primness in order to shew the old Aunt what a devilish clever fellow of a Nephew she is to have  WhatI'll tell theeHickman in good manners will leave the women in their Cabinand to shew his courage with his breeding be upon deck  Well and suppose he is  Suppose he isWhy then I hope it is easy for Ganmore or anybody else myself suppose in my peajacket and great watchcoat if any other make a scruple to do it while he stands in the way gaping and staring like a novice to stumble against him and push him overboardA rich thoughtIs it not Belford He is certainly plaguy officious in the Ladies correspondence and I am informed plays double between Mother and Daughter in fear of both Dost not see him JackI dopopping up and down his wig and hat floating by him and paddling pawing and dashing like a frighted mongrel I am afraid he never ventured to learn to swim  But thou wilt not drown the poor fellow wilt thou  No noThat is not necessary to the projectI hate to do mischiefs supererogatory The skiff shall be ready to save him while the vessel keeps its course He shall be set on shore with the loss of wig and hat only and of half of his little wits at the place where he embarked or anywhere else  Well but shall we not be in danger of being hanged  for three such enormous Rapes altho' Hickman should escape with only a bellyful of seawater  Yes to be sure when caughtBut is there any likelihood of thatBesides have we not been in danger before now for worse factsAnd what is there in being only in  danger  If we actually were to appear in open day in England before matters are made up there will be greater likelihood that these women will  not  prosecute than that they  will  For my own part I should wish they  may  Would not a brave fellow chuse to appear in court to such an arraignment confronting women who would do credit to his attempt The country is more merciful in  these  cases than in  any others  I should therefore like to put myself upon my country  Let me indulge a few reflections upon what thou mayst think the  worst  that  can  happen I will suppose that thou art one of us and that all five are actually brought to tryal on this occasion How bravely shall we enter a court  I  at the head of you dressed out each man as if to his weddingappearanceYou are sure of all the women old and young of your sideWhat brave fellowsWhat fine gentlemen There goes a charming handsome manmeaning me to be sureWho could find in their hearts to hang such a gentleman as that whispers one Lady sitting perhaps on the right hand of the Recorder I suppose the scene to be in London While another disbelieves that any woman could  fairly  swear against  me  All will croud after  me  It will be each man's happiness if ye shall chance to be bashful to be neglected I shall be found to be the greatest criminal and my safety for which the general voice will be engaged will be yours  But then comes the triumph of triumph that will make the accused look up while the accusers are covered with confusion  Make room thereStand byGive back  One receiving a rap another an elbow half a score a push apiece  Enter the slowmoving hoodedfaced downlooking Plaintiffs  And first the Widow with a sorrowful countenance tho' halfveil'd pitying her Daughter more than herself The people the women especially who on this occasion will be fivesixths of the spectators reproaching herYou'd have the conscience would you to have five such brave gentlemen as these hanged for you know not what  Next comes the poor maidwho perhaps had been ravished twenty times before and had not appeared now but for companysake mincing simpering weeping by turns not knowing whether she should be sorry or glad  But every eye dwells upon MissSee see the handsome gentleman bows to her  To the very ground to be sure I shall bow and kiss my hand  See her confusion See She turns from him Ay that's because it is in open court cries an arch oneWhile others admire herAy that's a girl worth venturing one's neck for  Then we shall be praisedEven the Judges and the whole crouded Bench will acquit us in their hearts and every single man wish he had been me The women all the time disclaiming prosecution were the case to be their own To be sure Belford the sufferers cannot put half so good a face upon the matter as we  Then what a noise will this matter makeIs it not enough suppose us moving from the Prison to the Sessionshouse  Within these few years past a passage has been made from the Prison to the S  ssions house whereby malefactors are carried into court without going thro' the street Lovelace's triumph on their suppos  d march shews the wisdom of this alteration  to make a noble heart thump it away most gloriously when such an one finds himself  attended to his tryal by a parade of guards and officers of miens and aspects warlike and unwarlike himself their whole care and their businessweapons in their hands some bright some rusty equally venerable for their antiquity and inoffensiveness others of more authoritative demeanour strutting before with fine painted staves shoals of people following with a Which is he whom the  young  Lady appears againstThen let us look down look up look round which way we will we shall see all the doors the shops the windows the signirons and balconies garrets gutters and chimneytops included all whitecapt blackhooded and periwigg'd or cropear'd up by the  Immobile Vulgus  While the floating  streetswarmers  who have seen us pass by at one place run with stretchedout necks and strained eyeballs a roundabout way and elbow and shoulder themselves into places by which we have not passed in order to obtain another sight of us every street continuing to pour out its swarms of latecomers to add to the gathering snowball who are content to take descriptions of our persons behaviour and countenances from those who had the good fortune to have been in time to see us  Let me tell thee Jack I see not why to judge according to our principles and practices we should not be as much elated in our march were this to happen to us as others may be upon any other the most  mobattracting  occasionSuppose a Lord Mayor on his  Gawdy  suppose a victorious General or Embassador on his public EntrySuppose as I began with the  lowest  the  grandest  parade that can be supposed a CoronationFor in all these do not the royal guard the heroic trainedbands the pendent clinging throngs of spectators with their waving heads rolling toandfro from housetops to housebottoms and streetways as I have above described make the principal part of the Rareeshew  And let me ask thee If thou dost not think that either the Mayor the Embassador or the General would not make very pitiful figures on their Gala's did not the trumpets and tabrets call together the Canaille to gaze at themNor perhaps should We be the most guilty Heroes neither For who knows how the Magistrate may have obtained his gold chain While the General probably returns from cutting of throats and from murders sanctified by custom only Caesar we are told  Pliny gives this account putting the number of men slain at See also Lipsius  de Constantia    had won at the age of Fiftysix when he was assassinated fifty pitched battles had taken by assault above a thousand towns and slain near men I suppose exclusive of those who fell on his own side in slaying them Are not you and I Jack innocent men and babes in swadling cloths compared to Caesar and to his predecessor in heroism Alexander dubbed for murders and depredation  Magnus  The principal difference that strikes me in the comparison between us and the Mayor the Embassador the General on  their  Gawdies is that the mob make a greater noise a louder huzzaing in the one case than in the other which is called  acclamation  and ends frequently in  higher  taste by throwing dead animals at one another before they disperse in which they have as much joy as in the former part of the triumph While they will attend us with all the marks of an awful or silent at most only a whispering respect their mouths distended as if set open with gags and their voices generally lost in goggleeyed admiration  Well but suppose after all we are convicted what have we to do but in time make over our estates that the sheriffs may not revel in our spoils There is no fear of being hanged for such a crime as this while we have  money  or  friends  And suppose  even the worst that two or three were to die have we not a chance each man of us to escape The devil's in 'em if they'll hang Five for ravishing Three  I know I shall get off for onewere it but for familysake And being a handsome fellow I shall have a dozen or two of young maidens all dressed in white go to Court to beg my lifeAnd what a pretty shew they will make with their white hoods white gowns white petticoats white scarves white gloves kneeling for me with their white handkerchiefs at their eyes in two pretty rows as Majesty walks thro' them and nods my pardon for their sakesAnd if once pardoned all is over For Jack in a crime of this nature there lies no appeal as in a murder  So thou seest the worst that can happen should we  not  make the Grand Tour upon this occasion but stay and take our tryals But it is most likely that they will not prosecute at all If not no risque on our side will be run only taking our pleasure abroad at the worst leaving friends tired of us in order after a time to return to the same friends endeared to us as we to them by absence  This Jack is my scheme at the first running I know it is capable of improvementFor example I can land these Ladies in France whip over before they can get a passage back or before Hickman can have recovered his fright and so find means to entrap my Beloved on boardAnd then all will be right and I need not care if I were never to return to England  Memorandum To be considered ofWhether in order to complete my vengeance I cannot contrive to kidnap away either James Harlowe or Solmes or both A man Jack

there is a sorry fellow in the world who has presumed to question whether the prize when obtained is worthy of the pains it costs me Yet knows with what patience and trouble a birdman will spread an acre of ground with gins and snares set up his stalkinghorse his glasses plant his decoybirds and invite the feathered throng by his whistle and all his prize at last the reward of early hours and of

years and views But then is not a fine woman the noblest trifle that ever was or could be obtained by manAnd to what purpose do we say  obtained  if it be not in the way we wish forIf a man is rather

particulars of our conversation in the  circumrotation  we took while in the coachShe had received a Letter from Miss Howe yesterday I presumed  She made no answer How happy should I think myself to be admitted into their correspondence I would joyfully make an exchange of communications  So tho' I hoped not to succeed by her consent and little did she think I had so happily in part succecded without it I thought it not amiss to urge for it for several reasons Among others that I might account  to her for my constant employment at my pen in order to take off her jealousy that  she  was the subject of thy correspondence and mine And that I might justify  my  secrecy and  uncommunicativeness  by her  own    I proceeded thereforeThat I loved Familiarletterwriting as I had more than once told her above all the species of writing It was writing from the heart without the fetters prescribed by method or study as the very word  Correspondence  implied Not the heart only the  soul  was in it Nothing of body when friend writes to friend the mind impelling sovereignly the vassalfingers It was in short friendship recorded friendship given under hand and seal demonstrating that the parties were under no apprehension of changing from time or accident when they so liberally gave testimonies which would always be ready on failure or infidelity to be turned against themFor my own part it was the principal diversion I had in her absence But for this innocent amusement the distance she so frequently kept me at would have been intolerable  Sally knew my drift and said She had had the honour to see two or three of my letters and of Mr Belford's and she thought them the most entertaining that she had ever read  My friend Belford I said had a happy talent in the Letterwriting way and upon all subjects  I expected my Beloved would have been inquisitive after our subjects But lying perdue as I saw not a word said she So I touched upon this article myself  Our topics were various and diffuse Sometimes upon literary articles She was very attentive upon this sometimes upon the public entertainments sometimes amusing each other with the fruits of the different correspondencies we held with persons abroad with whom we had contracted friendships sometimes upon the foibles and perfections of our particular friends sometimes upon our own present and future  hopes sometimes aiming at humour and raillery upon each otherIt might indeed appear to savour of vanity to suppose my Letters would entertain a Lady of her delicacy and judgment But yet I could not but say that perhaps she would be far from thinking so hardly of me as sometimes she had seemed to do if she were to see the Letters which generally passed between Mr Belford and me I hope Jack thou hast more manners than to give me the lye tho' but in thy heart  She then spoke After declining my compliment in such a manner as only a person could do who deserved it she said For her part she had always thought me a man of sense A man of sense Jack What a niggardly praiseAnd should therefore hope that when I wrote it exceeded even my speech For that it was impossible be the Letters written in as easy and familiar a style as they would but that they must have that advantage from sitting down to write them which prompt speech could not always have She should think it very strange therefore if my Letters were barren of sentiment and  as  strange if I gave myself liberties upon  premeditation  which could have no excuse at all but from a thoughtlessness which itself wanted excuseBut if Mr Belford's Letters and mine were upon subjects so general and some of them equally she presumed instructive and entertaining she could not but say that she should be glad to see any of them and particularly those which Miss Martin had seen and praised  This was put close  I looked at her to see if I could discover any tincture of jealousy in this hint that  Miss Martin  had seen what I had not shewn to  her  But she did not look it So I only said I should be very proud to shew her not only those but all that passed between Mr Belford and me but I must remind her that she knew the condition  No indeed with a sweet lip pouted out as saucy as pretty implying a lovely scorn that yet can only be lovely in youth so blooming and beauty so divinely distinguished  How I long to see such a motion again  Her  mouth only can give it  But I am mad with LoveYet eternal will be the distance at the rate I go on Now fire now ice my soul is continually upon the  hiss  as I may say In vain however is the trial to quenchwhat after all is unquenchable  Pry'thee Belford forgive my nonsense and my Vulcanlike metaphorsDid I not tell thee not that I am  sick  of Love but that I am  mad  with it Why brought I such an angel into such a house into such company And why do I not stop my ears to the Sirens who knowing my aversion to wedlock are perpetually touching that string  I was not willing to be answered so easily I was sure that what passed between two such young Ladies friends so dear might be seen by everybody I had more reason than anybody to wish to see the Letters that passed between her and Miss Howe because I was sure they must be full of admirable instruction and one of the dear correspondents had deigned to wish my entire reformation  She looked at me as if she would look me thro' I thought I  felt  eyebeam after eyebeam penetrate my shivering reinsBut she was silent Nor needed her eyes the assistance of speech  Nevertheless a little recovering myself I hoped that nothing unhappy had befallen either Miss Howe or her Mother The Letter of yesterday sent by a particular hand she opening it with great emotion seeming to have expected it soonerwere the reasons for my apprehensions  We were then at Muswellhill  A pretty country within the eye  to Polly was the remark instead of replying to  me    But I was not so to be answeredI should expect some charming subjects and characters from two such pens I hoped everything went on well between Mr Hickman and Miss Howe Her Mother's heart I said was set upon that match Mr Hickman was not without his merits He was what they Ladies called a SOBER man But I must needs say that I thought Miss Howe deserved a husband of a very different cast  This I supposed would have engaged her into a subject from which I could have wiredrawn somethingFor Hickman is one of her favouritesWhy I can't divine except for the sake of opposition of character to that of thy honest friend  But she cut me short by a look of disapprobation and another cool remark upon a distant view and  How far off Miss Horton do you think that clump of trees may be  pointing out of the coachSo I had done  Here endeth all I have to write concerning our conversation on this our agreeable airing  We have both been writing  c  Vol  iv  Edit  i  p    l    and Edit  ii  p    l    add the following paragraph  'Tis true I have owned more than once that I could have liked Mr Lovelace above all men I remember the debates you and I used to have on this subject when I was your happy guest You used to say and once you wrote that men of his cast are the men that our Sex do not  naturally  dislike While I held that such were not however  that  might be the men we  ought  to like But what with my Relations precipitating of me on one hand and what with his unhappy character and embarrassing ways on the other I had no more leisure than inclination to examine my own heart in this particular And this reminds me of a passage in one of your former Letters  which I will transcribe tho' it was written in raillery  May it not be  say you  See Vol i p of both Editions    that you have had such persons to deal with as have not allowed you to attend to the throbs or if you had them a little nowandthen whether having had two accounts to place them to you have not by mistake put them to the wrong one  A passage which altho' it came into my mind when Mr Lovelace was least exceptionable yet that I have denied any efficacy to when he has teazed and vexed me and given me cause of suspicion For after all my dear Mr Lovelace is not wise in all his ways And should we not endeavour as much as is possible where we are not attached by  natural  ties to like and dislike as reason bids us and according to the merit or demerit of the object If Love as it is called is allowed to be an excuse for our most unreasonable follies and to lay level all the fences that a careful education has surrounded us by what is meant by the doctrine of subduing our passionsBut O my dearest friend am I not guilty of a punishable fault were I to love this man of errors And has not my own heart deceived me when I thought I did not And what must be that Love that has not some degree of purity for its object I am afraid of recollecting some passages in my Cousin Morden's Letter  See Vol iii Edit i p seq and Edit ii p seq  And yet why fly I from subjects that duly considered might tend to correct and purify my heart I have carried I doubt my notions on this head too high not for practice but for  my  practice Yet think me not guilty of Prudery neither for had I found out as much of myself before or rather had he given me heart'sease enough before to find it out you should have had my confession sooner  Nevertheless let me tell you  c  Vol  iv  Edit  i  p    l    and Edit  ii  p    l    after the words  Miss Howe's Smuggling scheme  insert  My conscience I should think ought not to reproach me for a contrivance which is justified by the contrivances of two such girls as these One of whom the more excellent of the two I have always with her own approbation as I imagine proposed for my imitation  But here Jack is the thing that concludes me and cases my heart with adamant I find by Miss Howe's Letters that it is owing to  her  that I have made no greater progress with my blooming Fairone She loves me The Ipecacuanha contrivance convinces me that she loves me Where there is Love there must be confidence or a desire of having  reason  to confide Generosity founded on my supposed generosity has taken hold of her heart Shall I not now see since I must be for ever unhappy if I marry her and leave any trial unessayed what I can make of her Love and her newlyraised confidenceWill it not be to my glory to succeed And to hers and to the honour of her Sex if I cannot Where then will be the hurt to either to make the trial And cannot I as I have often said reward her when I will by marriage  'Tis late or rather early  c  Vol  iv  Edit

and open still more agreeable prospects Mean time be assured that there cannot possibly be any good fortune befal me which I shall look upon with equal delight to that I have in your friendship  My

act of Religion I thought it as I told thee once a most agreeable sight to see Rich and Poor all of a  company  as I might say assembled once a week in one place and each in his or her best attire to worship the God that made them Nor could it be a hardship upon a man liberally educated to make  one  on so solemn an occasion and to hear the harangue of a man of Letters tho' far from being the principal part of the Service as it is too generally looked upon to be whose studies having taken a different turn from his own he must always have something new to say  She shook her head and repeated the word  New  But looked as if willing to be satisfied for the present with this answer To be sure Jack she means to do great despight to his Satanic Majesty in her hopes of reforming me No wonder therefore if he exerts himself to prevent her and to be revengedBut how  came this inI am ever of party against myself One day I fansy I shall hate myself on recollecting what I am about at

revenge whenever I meditate treason against so sovereign a virtue Conscience is dead and gone as I told thee so it cannot be that A young Conscience growing up like the phoenix from the ashes of the old one it cannot be surely But if it were it would be hard if I could not overlay a young Conscience  Well then it must be LOVE I fansy LOVE itself inspiring Love of an object so adorableSome little attention possibly paid too to thy whining arguments in her favour  Let LOVE then be allowed to be the moving principle and the rather as LOVE naturally makes the Lover loth to disoblige the object of its flame and knowing that an offence of the  meditated  kind will be a mortal offence to her cannot bear that I should think of giving it  Let LOVE and me talk together a little on this subjectBe it a  Young Conscience  or  Love  or  Thyself  Jack thou seest that I am for giving every whiffler audience But  this  must be the last debate on this subject for is not her fate in a manner at its crisis And must not my next step be an irretrievable one tend it which way it will  AND now the debate is over  A thousand charming things for LOVE is gentler than CONSCIENCE has this little urchin suggested in her favour  He pretended to know both our hearts And he would have it that tho' my Love was a prodigious strong and potent Love and tho' it has the merit of many months faithful service to plead and has had  infinite difficulties to struggle with yet that it is not THE RIGHT SORT OF LOVE  Right sort of Love  A puppyBut with due regard to your deityship said I what merit has she with YOU that  you  should be of her party Is  hers  I pray you a  right sort of Love  Is it  Love  at all She don't  pretend  that it is She owns not your sovereignty What a dl moves  You  to plead thus earnestly for a rebel who despises your power  And then he came with his  If  's and  And  'sAnd it would  have been  and  still  as he believed would be Love and a Love of the exalted kind if I would encourage it by the  right sort of Love  he talked of And in justification of his opinion pleaded her own confessions as well those of yesterday as of this morning And even went so far back as to my Ipecacuanhaillness  I never talked so familiarly with his godship before Thou mayest think therefore that his dialect sounded oddly in my ears And then he told me how often I had thrown cold water upon the most charming flame that ever warmed a Lady's bosom while yet but young and rising  I required a definition of this  right sort  of Love He tried at it But made a sorry hand of it Nor could I for the soul of me be convinced that what he meant to extol was LOVE  Upon the whole we had a notable controversy upon this subject in which he insisted upon the  unprecedented merit  of the Lady Nevertheless I got the better of him for he was struck absolutely dumb when waveing her present perverseness which yet was a sufficient answer to all his pleas I asserted and offered to prove it by a thousand instances  impromptu  that Love was not governed by  merit  nor could be under the dominion of  prudence  or any other  reasoning power  And that if the Lady were capable of Love it was of such a sort of Love  as he had nothing to do with  and which never before reigned in a female heart  I asked him What he thought of her flight from me at a time when I was more than half overcome by the  right sort of Love  he talked ofAnd then I shewed him the Letter she wrote and left behind her for me with an intention no doubt absolutely to break my heart or to provoke me to hang drown or shoot myself to say nothing of a multitude of declarations from her defying his power and imputing all that looked like Love in her behaviour to me to the persecution and rejection of her friends which made her think of me but as a last resort  LOVE then gave her up The Letter he said deserved neither pardon nor excuse He did not think he had been pleading for such a  declared  rebel And as to the rest he should be a betrayer of the rights of his own sovereignty if what I had alleged were true and he were still to plead for her  I swore to the truth of all And  truly  I swore Which perhaps I do not always do  And now what thinkest thou must become of the Lady whom LOVE itself gives up and CONSCIENCE cannot plead for  Vol  v  p  dele  paragr  penult  and read  I sent up the Letter to my Beloved by Mrs Bevis with a repeated request for admittance to her presence upon it But neither did this stand me in stead I suppose she thought it would be allowing of the consequences that were naturally to be expected to follow the obtaining of this instrument if she had consented to see me on the contents of this Letter having refused me that honour before I sent it up to herNo surprising herNo advantage to be taken of her inattention to the nicest circumstances  And now Belford I set out upon business  Vol  v  p    l  penult  after  a merry evening  insert  Thou wilt be curious to know what the  persons  of  these women are to whom I intend so much distinction I think I have not heretofore mentioned anythingcharacteristic of their persons  Mrs  Moore  is a widow of about Thirtyeight a little mortified by misfortunes but those are often the merriest folks when warmed She has good features still and is what they call much of a gentlewoman and very neat in her person and dress She has given over I believe all thoughts of our Sex But when the dying embers are raked up about the halfconsumed stump there will be fuel enough left I dare say to blaze out and give a comfortable warmth to a halfstarved by stander  Mrs  Bevis  is comely that is to say plump a lover of mirth and one whom no grief ever dwelt with I dare say for a week together about Twentyfive years of age Mowbray will have very little difficulty with her I believe for one cannot do everything one's self And yet sometimes women of this free cast when it comes to the point answer not the promises their chearful forwardness gives a man who has a view upon them  Miss  Rawlins  is an agreeable young Lady enough but not beautiful She has sense and would be thought  to know the world  as it is called but for her knowlege is more indebted to  Theory  than  Experience  A mere whiptsyllabub knowlege this Jack that always fails the person who trusts to it when it should hold to do her service For such young Ladies have so much dependence upon their own understanding and wariness are so much above the cautions that the less opinionative may be benefited by that their presumption is generally their overthrow when attempted by a man of experience who knows how to flatter their vanity and to magnify their wisdom in order to take advantage of their folly But for Miss Rawlins if I can add  Experience  to her  Theory  what an accomplished person will she beAnd how much will she  be obliged to me and not only  she  but all those who may be the better for the  precepts  she thinks herself already so well qualified to give Dearly Jack do I love to engage with these  preceptgivers  and  examplesetters    Now Belford altho' there is nothing striking in any of these characters yet may we at a pinch make a good frolicky halfday with them if after we have softened their wax at table by encouraging viands we can set our women and them into dancing Dancing which all women love and all men should therefore promote for  both  their sakes  And thus when Tourville sings Belton fiddles Mowbray makes rough love and I smooth and thou Jack wilt be by that time well enough to join in the chorus the devil's in't if we don't mould them into what shape we pleaseour own women by their laughing freedoms encouraging them to break thro' all their customary reserves For Women to Women thou knowest are great darers and incentives not one of them loving to be outdone or outdared when their hearts are thoroughly warmed  I know at first the difficulty will be the  accidental  absence of my dear Mrs Lovelace to whom principally they will design their visit But if we can exhilarate them they won't then wish to see her and I can form twenty accidents and excuses from one hour to another for her absence till each shall have a subject to take up all her thoughts  I am really sick at heart for a frolick  c  Vol  v  p    l    after  in their traces  insert  I AM just come from these Sorceresses  I was forced to take the Mother down for she began with her Hoh Sirs with me and to catechize and upbraid me with as much insolence as if I owed her money  I made her fly the Pit at last Strange wishes  wished we against each other at her quitting it  What were they  I'll tell theeShe wished me married and to be jealous of my Wife and my HeirApparent the child of another man I was even with her with a vengeance And yet thou wilt think that could not well be  As how  As how Jack Why I wished her Conscience come to lifeAnd I know by the gripes  mine  gives me every halfhour that she would then have a cursed time of it  Sally and Polly gave themselves high airs too Their first favours were thrown at me Women to boast of those favours which they were as willing to impart first forms all the difficulty with them as I to receive how whimsical I was upbraided with Ingratitude  Dastardice  and all my difficulties with my angel charged upon myself for want of following my blows and for leaving the proud Lady mistress of her own will and nothing to  reproach herself with  And all agreed that the arts used against her on a certain occasion had too high an operation for them or me to judge what her will  would have been  in the arduous trial And then they blamed one another as I cursed them all  They concluded that I should certainly marry and be  a lost man  And Sally on this occasion with an affected an malicious laugh snapt her fingers at me and pointing two of each hand forkedly at me bid me remember the lines I once shewed her of my favourite  Jack  Dryden as she always familiarly calls that celebrated Poet  We women to new joys unseen may move  There are no prints left in the paths of Love  All goods besides by public marks are known  But those

their affections would not have made such a rout as my Beloved has done about such an affair as that we were assembled upon Young Ladies as I have observed on an hundred occasions fear not half so much for  themselves  as their Mothers do for them But here the Girls were forced to put on grave airs and to seem angry because the Antiques made the matter of such high importance Yet so lightly sat anger and fellowfeeling at their hearts that they were forced to purse in their mouths to suppress the smiles I nowandthen laid out for While the Elders having had Roses that is to say Daughters of

cage How would I make her flutter and fly aboutTill she left a feather upon every wire  Had I begun there I am confident as I have heretofore said that I should not have had half the difficulty with her as I have had with her charming friend For these passionate girls have high pulses and a clever fellow may make what sport he pleases with their  unevennesses  Now too high now too low you need only to provoke and appease them by turns to bear with them and forbear to teaze and ask pardon and sometimes to give yourself the merit of a sufferer from them then catching them in the moment of concession conscious of their ill usage of you they are all your own  But these sedate contemplative girls never out of temper but with reason when that reason is given them hardly ever pardon or afford you another opportunity to offend  It was in part the apprehension that this would be so with my dear Miss Harlowe that made me carry her to a place where I believed she would be unable to escape me altho' I were  not  to succeed in my first attempts Else widow Sorlings's would have been as  well for me as widow Sinclair's For early I saw that there was no credulity in her to graft upon No pretending to whine myself into her confidence She was proof against amorous persuasion She had  reason  in her Love Her penetration and good sense made her hate all compliments that had not truth and nature in them What could I have done with her in any other place And yet how long even  there  was I kept in awe in spite of  natural incitement  and  unnatural instigations  as I now think them by the mere force of that native dignity and obvious purity of mind and manners which fill every one with reverence if not with  holy love  as thou callest it the moment he sees herElse thinkest thou not it was easy for me to be a  fine gentleman  and a  delicate  Lover or at least a  specious  and  flattering  one  Lady Sarah and Lady Betty finding the treaty upon the success of which they have set their foolish hearts likely to run into length are about departing to their own Seats having taken from me the best security the nature of the case will admit of that is to say  my word  to marry the Lady if she will have me  And after all methinks thou askest Art thou still resolved to repair if reparation be put into thy power  Why Jack I must needs own that my heart has nowandthen some retrograde motions upon thinking seriously of the irrevocable ceremony We do not easily give up the desire of our hearts and what we imagine essential to our happiness let the expectation or hope of compassing it be ever so unreasonable or absurd in the opinion of others  Recurrings  there will be hankerings that will on every but remotelyfavourable incident however before discouraged and beaten back by ill success pop up and abate the satisfaction we should otherwise take in  contrariant  overtures  'Tis ungentlemanly Jack  man to man  to lye  But Matrimony I do not  heartily  lovealtho' with a CLARISSAYet I am in earnest to marry her  But I am often thinking that if now this dear creature suffering time and my penitence my relations prayers and Miss Howe's meditation to soften her  resentments  Her  revenge  thou hast prettily distinguished away and to recall repulsed inclination should consent to meet me at the altarHow vain will she then make all thy eloquent periods of execrationHow many charming interjections of her own will she spoil And what a couple of old Patriarchs shall we become going on in the millhorse round getting sons and daughters providing Nurses for them first Governors and Governesses next teaching them lessons their Father never practised nor which their Mother as her Parents will say was much the better for And at last perhaps when life shall be turned into the dullysober Stilness and I become desirous to forget all my past Rogueries what comfortable reflections will it afford to find them all revived with  equal  or probably  greater  trouble and expence in the persons and manners of so many young Lovelaces of the Boys and to have the Girls run away with varlets perhaps not half so ingenious as myself clumsy fellows as it might happen who could not afford the baggages one excuse for their weakness besides those disgraceful ones of  Sex  and  Nature  O Belford who can bear to think of these things Who at my time of life especially and with such a byas for mischief  Of this I am absolutely convinced that if a man ever intends to marry and to enjoy in peace his own reflections and not be afraid of retribution or of the consequences of his own example he should never be a Rake  This looks like Conscience don't it Belford  But being in earnest still as I have said All I have to do  c  Vol  vi  p    l    after  can

women in  England  Her late Husband could not stand in the matrimonial contention of  Who should  but tipt off the perch in it neither knowing how to yield nor how to conquer  A charming encouragement for a man of intrigue whee he has reason to believe that the woman he has a view upon has no Love for her Husband What good Principles must that Wife have who is kept in against temptation by a sense of her duty and plighted faith where affection has no hold of her  Pr'ythee let's know very particularly how it fares with poor Belton'Tis an honest fellowSomething more than his Thomasine seems to stick with him  Thou hast not been preaching to him Conscience and Reformation hast thouThou shouldst not take liberries with him of this sort unless thou thoughtest him absolutely irrecoverable A man in ill health and cropsick cannot play with these solemn things as thou canst and be neither better nor worse for themRepentance Jack I have a notion should be set about while a man is in health and spirits What's a man fit for Not to begin a new work surely when he is not himself nor master of his facultiesHence as I apprehend it is that a deathbed repentance is supposed to be such a precarious and ineffectual thing  As to myself I hope I have a great deal of time before me since I intend  one day  to be a Reformed man I have very serious reflections nowandthen Yet am I halfafraid of the truth of what my Charmer once told me that  a man cannot repent when he will  Not to hold it I suppose she meant By fits and starts I have repented a thousand times  Casting my eye over the two preceding paragraphs I fansy there is something like contradiction in them But I will not reconsider them The subject is a very serious one I don't at present quite understand it But now for one more airy  Tourville Mowbray and myself  c  Vol  vi  p    l    after  to be of them  insert  To what Lovelace shall we attribute the tenderness which a  reputed  Father frequently shews to the children of another manWhat is that I pray thee which we call  Nature  and  Natural Affection  And what has man to boast of as to sagacity and penetration when he is as easily brought to cover and rear and even to love and often to prefer the product of another's guilt with his Wife or Mistress as a hen or a goose the eggs and even  young  of others of their kind  Nay let me ask If  instinct  as it is called in the animal creation does not enable them to distinguish their own much more easily than we with our boasted  reason  and sagacity in this nice particular can do  If some men who have Wives but of doubtful virtue considered this matter duly I believe their inordinate ardor after gain would be a good deal cooled when they could not be certain tho' their  Mates  could for whose children they were elbowing bustling gripeing and perhaps cheating those with whom they have concerns whether friends neighbours or  more  certain nextofkin by the Mother's side however  But I will not push this notion so far as it might be carried because if propagated it might be of  unsocial  or  unnatural  consequence since women of virtue would perhaps be more liable to suffer by the mistrusts and caprices of  badhearted  and  foolishheaded  Husbands than those who can screen themselves from detection by arts and hypocrisy to which a woman of  virtue cannot have recourse And yet were this notion duly and generally considered it might be attended with no bad effects as good education good inclinations and established virtue would be the principally soughtafter qualities and not money when a man not byassed by mere personal attractions was looking round him for a partner in his fortunes and for a mother of his future children which are to be the heirs of his possessions and to enjoy the fruits of his industry  But to return to poor Belton  If I have occasion for your assistance  c  Vol  vi  p    l    after  a life misspent  insert  It will be your turns byandby every man of ye if the justice of your country interpose not  Thou art the only Rake we have herded with if thou wilt not except myself who hast preserved entire thy health and thy fortunes  Mowbray indeed is indebted to a robust constitution that he has not yet suffered in his health but his Estate is dwindling away year by year  Threefourths of Tourville's very considerable fortunes are already dissipated and the remaining fourth will probably soon go after the other three  Poor Belton we see how it is with himHis only felicity is that he will hardly  live  to want  Thou art too proud and too prudent ever to be destitute and to do thee justice hast a spirit to assist such of thy friends as may be reduced and  wilt  if thou shouldst then be living But I think thou must much sooner than thou imaginest be called to thy accountknocked on the head perhaps by the friends of those whom thou hast injured for if thou escapest this fate from the Harlowe family thou wilt go on tempting danger and vengeance till thou meetest with vengeance and this whether thou marriest or not For the nuptial life will not I  doubt till age join with it cure thee of that spirit for intrigue which is continually running away with thee in spite of thy better sense and transitory resolutions  Well then I will suppose  thee  laid down quietly among thy worthier ancestors  And now let me look forward to the ends of Tourville and Mowbray Belton will be crumbled into dust before thee perhaps supposing thy early exit has saved them from gallows intervention  Reduced probably by riotous waste to consequential want behold them refuged in some obscene hole or garret obliged to the careless care of some dirty old woman whom nothing but her poverty prevails upon to attend to perform the last offices for men who have made such shocking ravage among the young ones  Then how miserably will they whine thro' squeaking organs Their big voices turned into puling pitybegging lamentations Their nowoffensive paws how helpless thenTheir nowerect necks then denying support to their aching heads those globes of mischief dropping upon their quaking shoulders Then what wry faces will they make their hearts and their heads reproaching each other Distended their parched mouthsSunk their unmuscled cheeksDropt their underjawsEach grunting like the swine he had resembled in his life Oh what a vile wretch have I beenOh that I had my life to come over againConfessing to the poor old woman who cannot shrive them Imaginary ghosts of deflowered Virgins and polluted matrons flitting before their glassy eyes And old Satan to their apprehensions grinning behind a lookingglass held up before them to frighten them with the horror visible in their own countenances  For my own part  c  Vol  vi  p    l    after  when disappointed  insert  There was Miss DORRINGTON Perhaps you know her not who ran away with her Father's groom because he would not let her have a halfpay officer with whom her passions all up she fell in love at first sight as he accidentally passed under her window  There was Miss SAVAGE she married her Mother's coachman because her Mother refused her a journey to Wales in apprehension that Miss intended to league herself with a remote Cousin of unequal fortunes of whom she was not a little fond when he was a visiting guest at their house for a week  There was the young widow SANDERSON who believing herself flighted by a younger Brother of a noble family Sarah Stout like took it into her head to drown herself  Miss SALLY ANDERSON You have heard of her no doubt being checked by her Uncle for encouraging an address beneath her in spite threw herself into the arms of an ugly dog a shoemaker's Apprentice running away with him in a pair of shoes he had just fitted to her feet tho' she never saw the fellow before and hated him ever after And at last took Laudanum to make her forget for ever her own folly  But can there be a stronger instance in point than what the unaccountable resentments of  such  a Lady as Miss Clarissa Harlowe afford us Who at this very instant  c  Vol  vi  p    l    after  word of command  insert  Mowbray and Tourville each intend to give thee a Letter and I leave to those rough varlets to handle thee as thou deservest for the shocking picture thou hast drawn of their last ends Thy own past guilt has stared thee full in the face one may see by it and made thee in consciousness of thy demerits sketch  out these cursed outlines I am glad thou hast got the old fiend to hold the glass before thy own face so soon Thou must be in earnest surely when thou wrotest it and have severe convictions upon thee For what a hardened varlet must he be who could draw such a picture as this in sport  As for thy resolution of repenting  c  Vol  vi  p    l antepenult after  pride truly spiritual  insert  One of my Loves in Paris was a Devotée She took great pains to convert me I gave way to her kind endeavours for the good of my soul She thought it a point gained to make me profess  some  Religion The Catholic has its conveniencies I permitted her to bring a  Father  to me My Reformation went on swimmingly The  Father  had hopes of me He paplauded her zeal So did I And how dost think it endedNot a girl in England reading thus far but would guessIn a word very happily For she not only  brought  me a Father but  made  me one And then being satisfied with each other's conversion we took different Routes She into Navarre I into Italy Both well inclined to propagate the good lessons in which we had so well instructed each other  But to return One consolation  c  Vol  vi  p    l ult after  against me to thee  insert  But thou seest Jack by her refusal of money from Hickman or Miss Howe that the dear Extravagant takes a delight in oddnesses chusing to part with her cloaths tho' for a song Dost think she is not a little touched at times I am afraid she is A little spice of that insanity I doubt runs thro' her that she had in a stronger degree in the first week of my operations Her contempt of life her proclamations her refusal of matrimony and now of money  from her most intimate friends are sprinklings of this kind and no other way I think to be accounted for  Her Apothecary is a good honest fellow I like him much But the silly dear's harping so continually upon one string dying dying dying is what I have no patience with I hope all this melancholy jargon is owing entirely to the way I would have her to be in And it being as new to her as the Bible beauties to thee no wonder she knows not what to make of herself and so fansies she is breeding death when the event will turn out quite the contrary  Thou art a sorry fellow in thy remarks on the education and qualification of Smarts and Beaux of the Rakish order if by thy  We's  and  Us's  thou meanest thyself or me For I pretend to say that the picture has no resemblance of Us who have read and conversed as we have done It may indeed and I believe it does resemble the generality of the fops and coxcombs about town But That let them look to for if it affects not me to what purpose thy random shotIf indeed thou findest by the new light darted in upon thee since thou hast had the honour of conversing with this admirable creature that the cap fits thy own head why then according to the  Qui capit  rule e'en take and clap it on And I will add a string of Bells to it to complete thee for the forehorse of the idiot team  Altho' I just now said a kind thing or two for this fellow Hickman yet I can tell thee I could to use one of my noble Peer's humble phrases  eat him up without a corn of salt  when I think of his impudence to salute my charmer  twice  at parting And have still less patience with the Lady herself for presuming to offer her cheek or lip Thou sayest not which to him and to press his clumsy fist between her charming hands An honour worth a King's ransom and what I would giveWhat would I not give to haveAnd then he in return to press  her as thou sayest he did to his stupid heart at that time no doubt more sensible than ever it was before  By thy description of their parting I see thou wilt be a delicate fellow in time My Mortification in this Lady's displeasure will be thy exaltation from her conversation I envy thee as well for thy opportunities as for thy improvements And such an impression has thy concluding paragraph made upon me that I wish I do not get into a Reformationhumour as well as thou And then what a couple of lamentable puppies shall we make howling in recitative to each other's discordant music  Let me improve upon the thought and imagine that turned Hermits we have opened the two old Caves at Hornsey or dug new ones and in each of our cells set up a death's head and an hourglass for objects of contemplationI have seen such a picture But then Jack had not the old penitent fornicator a suffocating long grey beard What figures would a couple of brocaded or lacedwaistcoated toupets make with their sour screw'd up halfcock'd faces and more than halfshut eyes in a kneeling attitude recapitulating their respective rogueries This scheme were we only to make trial of it and return afterwards to our old ways might serve to better purpose by far than Horner's in the Country Wife to bring the pretty wenches to us  Let me see The Author of Hudibras has somewhere a description that would suit us when met in one of our Caves and comparing our dismal notes together This is it Suppose  me  described  He sat upon his rump  His head like one in doleful dump  Betwixt his knees his hands apply'd  Unto his cheeks on either side  And by him in another hole  Sat stupid  Belford  cheek by jowl  I know thou wilt think me too ludicrous I think myself so It is truly to be ingenuous a forced put For my passions are so wound up that I am obliged either to laugh or cry Like honest drunken Jack Daventry Poor fellowWhat an unhappy end was hisThou knowest I used to observe that whenever he rose from an entertainment which he never did sober it was his way as soon as he got to the door to look round him like a carrierpigeon just thrown up in order to spy out his course and then taking to his heels he would run all the way home tho' it were a mile or two when he could hardly stand and must have tumbled on his nose if he had attempted to walk moderately This then be my excuse in this my unconverted estate for a conclusion so unworthy of the conclusion to thy third Letter  What a length have I runThou wilt own that if I pay thee not in quality  c  Vol

up thy brotherbears at Hockley in the Hole to the music of a Scots bagpipe Methinks I see thy clumsy sides shaking and shaking the sides of all beholders in these very attitudes thy fat head archly beating time on thy porterly shoulders right and left by turns as I once beheld thee practising to the hornpipe at Preston Thou remembrest the frolick as I have done an hundred times for I never before saw thee appear so much in character  But I know what I shall get by thisOnly that notable observation repeated That thy outside is the worst of thee and mine the best of me And so let it be Nothing thou writest of  this sort  can I take amiss  But I shall call thee seriously to account  c  Vol  vii  p    to Mr Lovelace's Letter add the following  POSTSCRIPT    Charlotte in a whim of delicacy is displeased that I send the inclosed Letter to youThat her handwriting forsooth should go into the hands of a single man  There's encouragement for thee Belford This is a certain sign that thou mayst have her if thou wilt And yet till she had given me this unerring demonstration of her glancing towards thee I could not have thought it Indeed I have often in pleasantry told her that I would bring such an affair to a bear But I never intended it because she really is dainty girl And thou art such a clumsy fellow in thy person that I should have as soon have wished her a Rhinoceros for an husband as thee But poor little dears they must stay till their time's come They won't have this man and they won't have that man from Seventeen to Twentyfive But then afraid as the saying is that  God has forgot them  and finding their bloom departing they are glad of whom they can get and verify the fable of the Parson and the Pears  Vol  vii  p    l    after  with my Letter  insert  One word more as to a matter of  erudition  which you greatly love to hear me  start  and  dwell upon  Dr Lewen once in  your  presence as you  my good Patron  cannot but remember in a  smartish  kind of debate between  him  and  me  took upon him to censure the  parenthetical  style as I call it He was a very learned and judicious man to be sure and an ornament to  our Function  But yet I must needs say that it is a style which I greatly like and the good Doctor was then past his  youth  and that time of life of  consequence when a  fertile imagination  and  rich fancy  pour in ideas so fast upon a writer that parentheses are often wanted and that for the sake of  brevity  as well as  perspicuity  to save the reader the trouble of reading a passage  more than once  Every man to his talent as I said before We are all so apt to set up our  natural byasses  for  general standards  that I wondered  the less  at the worthy Doctor's  stiffness  on this occasion He  smiled at me  you may remember SirAnd whether I was right or not I am sure I  smiled at him  And  you  my  worthy Patron  as I had the satisfaction to observe seemed to be of  my Party  But was it not strange that the  old gentleman  and  I  should so widely differ when the  end  with  both  that is to say  perspicuity  or  clearness  was the sameBut what shall we say  Errare est hominis sed non persistere  I think I have nothing to add  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  I left them  insert  As to what thou sayest of thy charming Cousin let me know if thou hast any meaning in it I have not the vanity to think myself deserving of such a Lady as Miss Montague And should not therefore care to expose myself to her scorn and to thy derision But were I assured I might avoid both these I would soon acquaint thee that I should think no pains nor assiduity too much to obtain a share in the good graces of such a Lady  But I know thee too well to depend upon anything thou sayest on this subject Thou lovest to make thy friends the object of ridicule to Ladies and imaginest from the vanity and in this respect I will say littleness of thine own heart that thou shinest the brighter for the foil  Thus didst thou once play off the rough Mowbray with Miss Hatton till the poor fellow knew not how to go either backward or forward  Vol  vii  p  dele  the two first paragraphs of Colonel Morden's Letter and read  I SHOULD not my dearest Cousin have been a fortnight in England without either doing myself the honour of waiting upon you in person or of writing to you if I had not been busying myself almost all the time in your service in hopes of makeing my Visit or Letter still more acceptable to you acceptable as I have reason to presume either will be from the unquestionable Love I ever bore you and from the esteem you always honoured me with  Little did I think that so many days would have been required to effect my wellintended purpose where there used to be a Love so ardent on one side and where there still is as I am thoroughly convinced the most exalted Merit on the other  I was yesterday with Mr Lovelace  c  Vol  vii  p  dele  the Paragraph beginning  Mr Brand's RecantationLetters  c and insert  Mr  BRAND  To Mr  JOHN WALTON    Sat Night Sept    Dear Mr  WALTON    I AM obliged to you for the very  handsomely penned  and  elegantly written  Letter which you have sent me on purpose to do  justice  to the  character  of the  younger  Miss Harlowe And yet I must tell you that I had reason  before that came  to  think  and to  know  indeed that we were  all wrong  And so I had employed the  greatest part  of this  week  in drawing up an  apologetical Letter  to my worthy  Patron  Mr John Harlowe in order to set all  matters  right  between  me  and  them  and  as far as I could  between  them  and  Miss  So it required little more than  connexion  and  transcribing  when I received  yours  and it will be with Mr Harlowe aforesaid  tomorrow morning  and this and the copy of that will be with you on  Monday morning    You cannot imagine how sorry I am that  you  and Mrs Walton and Mrs Barker and  I myself  should have taken matters up so lightly judging alasaday by appearance and conjecture where  character  and  reputation  are concerned Horace says truly  Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum  That is  Words once spoken cannot be recalled  But Mr Walton they may be  contradicted  by  other  Words and we may confess ourselves guilty of a  mistake  and express our  concern  for being  mistaken  and resolve to make our  mistake  a  warning  to us for the  future  And this is all that  can be done  and what every  worthy mind will do  and what nobody can be  readier to do  than  we four undesigning offenders  as I see by  your Letter  on  your part  and as you will see by the  inclosed copy  on  mine  which if it be received as I  think it ought  and as I  believe it will  must give me a  speedy  opportunity to see you when I  visit the Lady  to whom as you will see in it I expect to be sent up with the  olivebranch    The matter in which we all  erred  must be owned to be  very nice  and Mr Belford's  character considered appearances  ran very strong  against the Lady  But all that this serveth to shew is  That in doubtful matters the wisest people may be mistaken  for so saith the  Poet    Fallitur in dubiis hominum solertia rebus  If you have an  opportunity  you may as if  from yourself  and  unknown to me  shew the inclosed to  Mr Belford who you tell me  resenteth  the matter very heinously but not to let him  see  or  hear read  those words  that relate to him  in the paragraph at the  bottom of the second page  beginning  But yet I do insist upon it  to the  End  of that paragraph for one would not make one's self  enemies  you know And I have  reason to think  that this Mr  Belford  is as  passionate  and  fierce  a man as Mr Lovelace What pity it is the Lady could find no  worthier a Protector  You may paste those lines over with  blue or black paper  before he seeth it and if he insisteth upon taking a copy of my Letter for he or anybody that  seeth it  or  heareth it read  will no doubt be glad to have by them the copy of a Letter so full of the  sentiments  of the  noblest writers  of  antiquity  and  so well adapted  as I will be bold to say they are to the  point in hand  I say if he insisteth upon taking a copy let him give you the  strongest assurances  not to suffer it to be  printed  on  any account  and I make the same request to you that  you  will not For if anything be to be made of a  man's works  who but the  author  should have the  advantage  And if the  Spectators  the  Tatlers  the  Examiners  the  Guardians  and other of our polite papers make such a  strutting  with a  single verse  or so by way of  motto  in the  front  of  each day's  paper and if other  authors  pride themselves in  finding out  and  embellishing  the  titlepages  of their  books  with a  verse  or  adage  from the  classical writers  what a figure would  such a Letter as the inclosed make  so full fraught with  admirable precepts  and  àpropos quotations  from the  best authority  I have been told that a  certain noble Lord  who once sat himself down to write a  pamphlet  in behalf of a  great minister  after taking  infinite pains  to  no purpose  to find a  Latin motto  gave commission to a friend of  his  to offer to  any one  who could help him to a  suitable one  but of one or two lines a  hamper  of claret  Accordingly his Lordship had a  motto found him  from  Juvenal  which he  unhappily mistaking  not knowing  Juvenal  was a  poet  printed as a prose  sentence  in his  titlepage    If then  one  or  two  lines were of so much worth A  hamper of claret  No  less  of what  inestimable value  would  such a Letter as mine  be deemedAnd who knoweth but that this noble Pr who is now  i e  At the time this Letter was written  living if he should happen to see  this Letter  shining with such  a glorious string of jewels  might give the  writer a scarf  in order to have him  always at hand  or be a  means  some way or other to bring him into  notice  And I will be bold to say  bad  as the  world  is a man of  sound learning  wanteth nothing but an  initiation  to make his  fortune    I hope my good friend that the Lady will not  die  I shall be much  grieved  if she doth and the more because of mine  unhappy misrepresentation  So will  you  for the  same cause  So will her  parents  and  friends  They are very  rich  and  very worthy  Gentlefolks  But let me tell you  bytheby  that they had carried the matter against her  so far  that I believe in my heart they were glad to  justify themselves  by  my report  and would have been  less pleased  had I made a  more favourable one  And yet in  their hearts  they  dote  upon her But now they are all as I hear inclined to be  friends with her  and  forgive her  her  Brother  as well as  the rest    But their  Cousin  Col Morden a  very fine Gentleman  hath had such  high words  with them and they with him that they know not how to  stoop  lest it should look like being frighted into an  Accommodation  Hence it is that  I  have taken the greater liberty to  press the Reconciliation  and I hope in  such good season  that they will all be  pleased  with it For can they have a  better handle  to save their  pride  all round than by my  Mediation  And let me tell you inter nos  betwixt ourselves very proud they all are    By this  honest means  for by  dishonest ones  I would not be  Archbishop of Canterbury  I hope to please everybody to be  forgiven  in the  first place  by  the Lady  whom being a  lover of learning  and  learned men  I shall have great  opportunities  of  obliging  For when she departed from her Father's house I had but just the honour of her  notice  and she seemed  highly pleased  with my  conversation  and  next  to be  thanked  and  respected  by her  parents  and  all her family  as I am I bless God for it by my  dear friend  Mr John Harlowe Who indeed is a man that professeth a  great esteem  for  men of erudition  and who with  singular delight  I know will run over with me the  Authorities  I have  quoted  and  wonder  at my  memory  and the  happy knack  I have of recommending  mine own sense of things  in the words of the  greatest sages of antiquity    Excuse me my good friend for this  seeming vanity  The great Cicero you must have heard I suppose had a  much greater  spice of it and wrote a  long Letter begging  and  praying  to be  flattered  But if I say  less of myself  than other people who know me  say of me  I think I keep a  medium  between  vanity  and  false modesty  the latter of which oftentimes gives itself the  lye  when it is  declaring off  the  compliments  that  everybody  gives it as its due An hypocrisy as well as folly that I hope I shall for ever scorn to be guilty of  I have  another reason  as I may tell to you my  old schoolfellow  to make me wish for this  fine Lady's recovery  and  health  and that is by some distant intimations I have heard from Mr John Harlowe that it is  very likely  because of the  Slur  she hath received that she will chuse to  live privately  and  penitently  and will probably when she cometh into  her  Estate  keep a  Chaplain  to direct her in her  devotions  and  penitence  If she doth who can stand a  better chance  than  myself  And as I find by  your  account as well as by  everybody's  that she is innocent as to  intention  and is resolved never to think of Mr  Lovelace more  Who knoweth  what  in time  may happen  And yet it must be after Mr  Lovelace  's  death  which may possibly sooner happen than he  thinketh  of by means of his  detestable courses  For after all a man who is of  public utility  ought not for the  finest woman  in the world to lay his  throat  at the  mercy  of a man who boggleth at nothing  I beseech you let not this hint  go farther  than to  yourself  your  Spouse  and Mrs  Barker  I know I may trust my  life  in  your hands  and  theirs  There have been let me tell ye  unlikelier  things come to pass and that with  rich widows  some of  quality  truly whose choice in their  first marriages  hath perhaps been guided by  motives of convenience  or  mere corporalities  as I may say but who by their  second  have had for their view the  corporal  and  spiritual  mingled which is the most eligible no doubt to  substances  composed  of both  as  men  and  women  are  Nor think Sir that should such a thing come to pass  either  would be  disgraced  since  the Lady  in  me  would marry a  Gentleman  and a  Scholar  And as to  mine own honour  as the  Slur  would bring her  high fortunes  down to an  equivalence  with my  mean ones  if  fortune  only and not  merit  be considered so hath not the  life  of  this Lady  been  so tainted  either by  length of time  or  naughtiness of practice  as to put her on a  foot  with the  cast Abigails  that tootoo often God knoweth are thought good enough for a  young Clergyman  who perhaps is drawn in by a  poor benefice  and if the  wicked one  be not  quite worn out  groweth poorer and poorer upon it by an  encrease of family  he knoweth not whether  is most his  or his  noble ignoble  I should say  patron's    But all this  apart  and  in confidence    I know you made at school but a small progress in  languages  So I have restrained myself from  many illustrations  from the  classics  that I could have filled this Letter with as I have done the inclosed one And being at a  distanc  I cannot  explain  them to you as I  do to my friend  Mr John Harlowe who after all is obliged to  me  for pointing out to  him  many  beauties  of the  authors I quote  which otherwise would lie concealed from  him  as they must from every  common observer  But this too  inter nos  For he would not take it well to  have it known Jays  you know old Schoolfellow  Jays  you know  will strut in peacocks feathers    But whither am I running I never know where to end when I get upon  learned topics  And albeit I cannot compliment  you  with the  name of a learned man  yet are you  a sensible man  and  as such  must have  pleasure  in  learned men  and in  their writings    In this confidence Mr Walton with my  kind respects  to the good Ladies your  Spouse  and  Sister  and in hopes for the  young Lady's sake  soon to follow this long long epistle  in person  I conclude myself  Your loving and faithful friend  ELIAS BRAND  You will perhaps Mr Walton wonder at the meaning of the  lines drawn under many of the words and sentences  UNDERSCORING we call it and were my Letters to be printed those would be put in a  different character  Now you must know Sir that  we learned men  do this to point out to the readers who are not  so learned  where the  jet of our arguments lieth  and the  emphasis  they are to lay upon  those words  whereby they will take in readily our  sense  and  cogency  Some  pragmatical  people  have said that an author who doth a  great deal of this  either calleth his readers  fools  or tacitly condemneth  his own style  as supposing his meaning would be  dark  without it or that all his  force  lay in  words  But all of those with whom I have conversed in the learned way  think as I think  And to give a very  pretty  tho'  familiar illustration  I have considered a a page distinguished by  different characters  as  verdant field  overspread with  butterflowers  and  daisies  and other summerflowers These the poets liken to  enamelling  Have you not read in the poets of  enamelled meads  and so forth  Mr  BRAND  To  JOHN HARLOWE  Esq  Sat Night Sept    Worthy Sir  I AM under no  small concern  that I should unhappily be the  occasion  I am sure I  intended  nothing like it of  widening differences  by  light misreport  when it is the  duty  of one of  my function  and no less consisting with my  inclination  to  heal  and  reconcile    I have received two Letters to set me  right  One from a  particular acquaintance  whom I set to enquire of Mr Belford's character and that came on Tuesday last informing me that your  unhappy Niece  was greatly injured in the account I had had of her for I had told  him  of it and that with very  great concern  I am sure apprehending it to be  true  So I  then  set about writing to you to  acknowlege  the  error  And had gone a good way in it when the second Letter came a very  handsome one  it is both in  style  and  penmanship  from my friend Mr Walton tho' I am sure it cannot be  his inditing  expressing his sorrow and his Wife's and his Sisterinlaw's likewise for having been the cause of  misleading me  in the account I gave of the said  young Lady  whom they  now  say upon  further  enquiry  they find to be the  most unblameable  and  most prudent  and it seems the most  pious  young Lady that ever once committed a  great error  as to be sure  hers was  in leaving such  worthy Parents  and  Relations  for so  vile a man  as Mr Lovelace But what shall we sayWhy the divine Virgil tells us  Improbe Amor quid nonmortalia pectora cogis  For  my part  I was but too much afraid for we have  great opportunities  you are sensible Sir at the  University  of knowing  human nature  from  books  the  calm result  of the  wise mens wisdom  as I may say  Haurit aquam cribro qui discere vult sine libro  uninterrupted  by the  noise  and  vanities  that will mingle with  personal conversation  which in the  turbulent world  is not to be enjoyed but over a  bottle  where you have an  hundred foolish things  pass to  one that deserveth to be remembred  I was but too much afraid  I say  that so  great a slip  might be attended with  still greater  and  worse  For  your  Horace and  my  Horace the most charming writer that ever lived among the  Pagans  for the  lyric kind of poetry  I mean for to be sure  Homer  and  Virgil  would  otherwise  be  first  named  in their way  well observeth and who understood  human nature  better than he  Nec vera virtus cum semel excidit  Curat reponi deterioribus  And  Ovid  no less wisely observeth  Et mala sunt vicina bonis Errore sub illo  Pro vitio virtus crimina saepe tulit  Who that can draw  knowlege  from its  fountainhead  the works of the  sages of antiquity  improved by the  comments  of the  moderns  but would  prefer  to  all others the  silent quiet life  which  contemp  aire men  lead in the  seats of learning  were they  called out according to their  dedication  to the  vice  and  instruction  of the world  Now Sir  another  favourite poet of min  S not the  less a favourite  for being a  Christian    us that it is the custom of  some  when in a  fa  to throw the blame upon the backs of  others    Hominum quoque mos est  Quae nos cunque premunt alieno imponere tergo  MANT  But I tho' in this case  misled wellintendedly  nevertheless both in the  misleaders  and  misled  and therefore entitled to lay hold of that plea if  anybody  is so entitled will not however be classed among such  extenuators  but contrarily will always keep in mind that verse which  comforteth in mistake  as well as  instructeth  and which I quoted in my last Letter  Errare est hominis sed non persisiere  And will own that I was very  rash  to take up with  conjectures  and  consequences  drawn from  probabilities  where especially the  character  of so  fine a Lady  was concerned  Credere fallaci gravis est dementia famae  MANT  Notwithstanding Miss Clarissa Harlowe I must be bold to say is the  only young Lady  that ever I heard of or indeed read of that  having made such a false step  so  soon  of  her own accord  as I may say  recovered  herself and conquered her  Love of the deceiver  A great conquest indeed and who flieth him and resolveth to  die  rather than to be his which now to her neverdying  honour  I am well assured is the caseAnd in  justice  to her I am now ready to take to myself with no small vexation that of Ovid  Heu patior telis vulnera facta meis  But yet I do insist upon it that all  that part  of my  information  which I took upon mine own  personal enquiry  which is what relates to Mr  Belford  and  his character  is  literally true  for there is not anywhere to be met with a man of a more  libertine character  as to  women  Mr  Lovelace  excepted than he beareth  And so Sir I must desire of you that you will not let  any blame  lie upon my  intention  since you see how ready I am to  accuse myself  of too lightly giving ear to a  rash information  not knowing it so to be however For I depended the more upon it as the  people I had it from  are very  sober  and live in the  fear of God  And indeed when I wait upon you you will see by their Letter that they must be  conscientious  good people Wherefore Sir let me be entitled from  all your good family  to that of my lastnamed poet  Aspera confesso verba remitte reo  And now Sir what is much more becoming of my  function  let me instead of appearing with the  face of an accuser  and a  rash censurer  which in my  heart  I have not  deserved  to be thought assume the character of  a reconciler  and propose by way of  penance  to myself for my  fault  to be sent up as a  messenger of peace  to the  pious young Lady  for they write me word  absolutely  and I believe in my heart  truly  that the  Doctors  have  given her over  and that she  cannot live  Alas alas what a sad thing would that be if the  poor bough  that was only designed as I  very well know  and am  fully assured to be bent should be broken  Let it not dear Sir seem to the  world  that there was anything in your  resentments  which while meant for  reclaiming  were just and fit that hath the  appearance  of  violence  and  fierce wrath  and  inexorability  as it would look to some if carried to extremity after  repentance  and  contrition  and  humiliation  on the  fair offender's  side For all this while it seemeth she hath been a  second Magdalen  in her  penitence  and yet not so bad as a  Magdalen  in her  faults  faulty nevertheless as she hath been once the Lord knoweth  Nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur optimus ille est  Qui minimis urgetur  saith Horace  Now Sir if I may be named for this  blessed  employment For  Blessed is the peacemaker  I will hasten to London and as I know Miss had always a  great regard  to the  function  I have the honour to be of I have no doubt of making myself acceptable to her and to bring her by  sound arguments  and  good advice  into a  liking of life  which must be the  first step  to her  recovery  For when the  mind  is  made easy  the  body  will not  long suffer  and the  love of life  is a  natural passion  that is soon  revived  when fortune turneth about and smileth  Vivere quisque diu quamvis egenus aeger  Optat  OVID  And the sweet Lucan truly observeth  Fatis debentibus annos  Mors invita subit  And now Sir let me tell you what shall be the  tenor  of my  pleadings  with her and  comfortings  of her as she is as I may say a  learned Lady  and as I can  explain  to her  those sentences  which she cannot so readily  construe herself  And this in order to convince  you  did you not already  know  my  qualifications  how well qualified I  am  for the  Christian Office  to which I commend myself  I will IN THE FIRST PLACE put her in mind of the  common course of things  in this  sublunary world    in which  joy  and  sorrow sorrow  and  joy  succeed one another by  turns  in order to convince her that her griefs have been but according to  that  common course of things  Gaudia post luctus veniunt post gaudia luctus  SECONDLY I will remind her of her own notable description of  Sorrow  when she was once called upon to distinguish wherein  Sorrow Grief  and  Melancholy  differed from each other which she did  impromptu  by their  effects  in a truly admirable manner to the high satisfaction of every one I myself could not by  study  have distinguished  better  nor more  concisely  SORROW said she  wears  GRIEF  tears  but MELANCHOLY  sooths    My inference to her shall be that since a happy Reconciliation will take place  Grief  will be banished  Sorrow  dismissed and only sweet  Melancholy  remain to  sooth  and  indulge  her  contrite heart  and shew to all the world the penitent sense she hath of her great error  THIRDLY That her  Joys  Joy  let me here observe my dear Sir by way of Note is not absolutely inconsistent with  Melancholy  a  soft gentle Joy  not a  rapid  not a  rampant Joy  however but such a  Joy  as shall lift her  temporarily  out of her  soothing Melancholy  and then  let her down gently  into it again for  Melancholy  to be sure her  reflection  will generally make to be herstate  when restored to health and favour will be the greater the deeper her griefs were  Gaudia quae multo parta labore placent  FOURTHLY That having  really  been guilty of a  great error  she should not take  impatiently  the  correction  and  anger  with which she hath been treated  Leniter ex merito quicquid patiare ferundum est  FIFTHLY That  Virtue  must be established by  Patience  as saith Prudentius  Haec virtus vidua est quam non patientia firmat  SIXTHLY That in the words of Horace she may  expect better times  than of late she had  reason  to look for  Grata superveniet quae non sperabitur hora  SEVENTHLY That she is really now in  a way  to be  happy  since according to  Ovid  she  can count up all her woe  Felix qui patitur quae numerare potest  And those comforting lines  Estque serena dies post longos gratior imbres  Et post triste malum gratior ipsa salus  EIGHTHLY That in the words of Mantuan her  Parents  and  Uncles  could not  help loving her  all the time they were  angry at her  Aequa tamen semper mens est amica voluntas  Sit licet in natos facies austera parentum  NINTHLY That the  ills she hath met with  may be turned by the  good use  to be made of them to her  everlasting benefit  for that  Cum furit atque ferit Deus olim parcere quaerit  TENTHLY That she will be able to give a  fine lesson  a  very  fine lesson to all the  young Ladies  of her  acquaintance  of the  vanity  of being  lifted up  in  prosperity  and the  weakness  of being  cast down  in  adversity  since no one is so  high  as to be above being  humbled  so  low  as to  need to despair  For which purpose the advice of  Ausonius    Dum fortuna juvat caveto tolli  Dum fortuna tonat caveto mergi  I shall tell her that Lucan saith well when he calleth  adversity the element of patience  Gaudet patientia duris  That  Fortunam superat virtus prudentia famam  That while weak souls are  crushed by fortune  the  brave mind  maketh the fickle deity afraid of it  Fortuna fortes metuit ignavos premit  ELEVENTHLY That if she take the advice of  Horace    Fortiaque adversis opponite pectora rebus  it will delight her  hereafter  as  Virgil  saith to  revolve her past troubles  Forsan haec olim meminisse juvabit  And to the same purpose  Juvenal  speaking of the  prating joy  of mariners after all their  dangers are over  Gaudent securi narrare pericula nautae  Which suiting the case so well you'll forgive me Sir for  popping down  in  English metre  as the  translative impulse  pardon a new word and yet we  scholars  are not fond of  authenticating new  words came upon me  uncalled for  The Seaman safe on shore with joy doth tell  What cruel dangers him at sea befell  With  these  Sir and an  hundred more  wise  adages  which I have always at my  fingers end  will I when reduced to  form  and  method  entertain Miss and as she is a  wellread  and I might say but for this  one  great error a  wise  young Lady I make no doubt but I shall  prevail  upon her if not by  mine own arguments  by those of  wits  and  capacities  that have a  congeniality  as I may say to  her own  to take heart  Nor of the laws of fate complain  Since tho' it has been cloudy now 't clears up again  Oh what  wisdom  is there in these  noble classical authors  A  wise man  will upon searching into them always find that they speak  his  sense of  men  and  things  Hence it is that they so readily occur to  my memory  on every occasionTho' this may look like  vanity  it is too true to be omitted And I see not why a man may not  know those things of himself  which  everybody  seeth and  saith of him  who nevertheless perhaps know not  half so much as he  in other matters  I know but of  one objection  Sir that can lie against my going and that will arise from your kind  care  and  concern  for the  safety of my person  in case that  fierce  and  terrible man  the wicked Mr Lovelace of whom every one standeth in fear should come cross me as he may be resolved to try once more to  gain  a  footing  in  Miss's affections  But I will trust in  providence  for  my safety  while I shall be engaged in a  cause so worthy of my function  and the  more  trust in it as he is a  learned man  as I am told  Strange too that so  vile a Rake  I hope he will never see this should be a  learned man  that is to say that a  learned man  should find  leisure  to be a  Rake  Altho' possibly a  learned man  may be a  sly sinner  and take opportunities  as they come in his way  Which however I do assure you  I never did    I repeat That as he is a  learned man  I shall  vest myself  as I may say in  classical armour  beginning  meekly  with him for Sir  bravery  and  meekness  are qualities  very consistent with each other  and in no persons so shiningly  exert  themselves as in the  Christian priesthood  beginning  meekly  with him I say from Ovid  Corpora magnanimo satis est prostrâsse leoni  So that if I should not be safe behind the  shield  of  mine own prudence  I certainly should behind the  shields  of the  everadmirable classics  Of  Horace  particularly who being a  Rake  and a  jovial Rake  too himself must have great weight with all  learned Rakes    And who knoweth but I may be able to bring even this  Goliath in wickedness  altho' in  person  but a  little David  myself armed with the  slings  and  stones  of the  antient sages  to a due sense of his errors And what a victory would that be  I could here Sir pursuing the allegory of David and Goliath give you some of the  stones Hard arguments  may be called  stones  since they  knock down  a  pertinacious opponent  which I could  pelt him with  were he to be wroth with me and this in order to take from you Sir all apprehensions for my  life  or my  bones  but I forbear them till you demand them of me when I have the honour to attend you in person  And now my dear Sir what remaineth but that having shewn you what yet I believe you did not doubt how  well qualified  I am to attend the Lady wi  h the  olivebranch  I beg of you to dispatch me with it  out of hand  For if she be so  very ill  and if she should not live to receive the grace which to my knowlege all the  worthy family  design her how much will that grieve you all And then Sir of what avail will be the  eulogies  you shall all peradventure join to give to her memory For as Martial wisely observeth  Post cineres gloria sera venit  Then as  Ausonius  layeth it down with  equal propriety  that  those favours which are speedily conferred are the most graceful and obliging    And to the same purpose Ovid  Gratia ab officio quod mora tardat abest  And Sir whatever you do let the  Lady's pardon  be as  ample  and as  chearfully given  as she can  wish for it  that I may be able to tell her that it hath your  hands  your  countenances  and your  whole hearts  with itFor as the Latin verse hath it and I presume to think I have not weakened its sense by my humble advice  Dat bene dat multum qui dat cum munere vultum  And now Sir when I survey this long Letter  And here by way of Note permit me to say that no  sermon  I ever composed cost me half the  pains  that this Letter hath done But I know your great  appetite  after as well as  admiration  of the  antient wisdom  which you so justly prefer to the  modern  And indeed I join with you to think that the  modern  is only  borrowed  as the  moon  doth its light from the  sun  at least that we  excel  them in nothing and that our  best cogitations  may be found generally speaking more  elegantly  dressed and expressed by  them    albeit I see it enamelled as a  beautiful meadow  is enamelled by the  spring  or  summer flowers  very glorious to behold I begin to be afraid that I may have tired you and the more likely as I have written without that  method  or  order  which think constituteth the  beauty  of  good writing  Which  method  or  order  nevertheless may be the  better excused  in a  familiar epistle  as this may be called you pardoning Sir the  familiarity  of the  word  But yet not altogether  here  I must needs own because this is a  Letter  and  not a Letter  as I may say but a kind of  short  and  pithy Discourse  touching upon  various  and  sundry topics  every one of which might be a  fit theme  to enlarge upon even to volumes If this  Epistolary Discourse  then let me call it should be pleasing to you as I am inclined to think it will because of the  sentiments  and  aphorisms  of the  wisest of the antients  which  glitter thro' it  like so many  dazling  sunbeams  I will at my leisure work it up into a  methodical Discourse  and perhaps may one day print it with a  dedication  to my  honoured patron  if Sir I have  your  leave  singly  first but not till I have thrown out anonymously two or three  smaller things  by the success of which I shall have made myself of  some account  in the  Commonwealth of Letters  and afterwards in my  Works  Not for the  vanity  of the thing however I will say but for the  use  it may be of to the  public  for as one well observeth  Tho' glory always followeth virtue yet it should be considered only as its shadow    Contemnit laudem virtus licet usque sequatur  Gloria virtutem corpus ut umbra suum  A very pretty saying and worthy of all mens admiration  And now  most worthy Sir  my very good friend and patron referring the whole to  yours  and to your  two Brothers  and to  young Mr Harlowe  's consideration and to the wise consideration of good  Madam Harlowe  and her excellent Daughter  Miss Arabella Harlowe  I take the liberty to subscribe myself what I  truly am  and  ever shall delight to be  in  all cases  and at  all times    Your and their most ready and obedient as well as faithful Servant  ELIAS BRAND  Vol  vii  p    l    from the bottom after  whose more transient  insert  Now Lovelace let me know if the word  Grace  can be re'd from my pen without a sneer from thee and thy associates I own that once it sounded oddly in  my  ears But I shall never forget what a grave man once said on this very wordThat with him it was a  Rake's  Shibboleth  See Judges xii  He had always hopes of one who could bear the mention of it without ridiculing it and ever gave him up for an abandoned man who made a jest of it or of him who used it  Don't be disgusted  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  thy wise consideration  insert  Mr Belford returns a very serious Answer to the preceding Letter  which appears not    In it he most heartily wishes that he had withstood Mr Lovelace whatever had been the consequence in designs so elaboratelybase and ungrateful and so long and steadily pursued against a Lady whose merit and innocence entitled her to the protection of every man who had the least pretences to the title of a  Gentleman  and who deserved to be even  the Public Care    He most severely censures himself for his false notions of Honour to his Friend on this head and recollects what the Divine Lady as he calls her said to him on this very subject as related by himself in his Letter to Lovelace Vol VI p to which Lovelace also both  Instigator  and  Accuser  refers and to his own regret and shame on the occasion He distinguishes however between an irreparable injury intended to a CLARISSA and one designed to  such  of the Sex as contribute by their weakness and indiscretion to their own fall and thereby entitle themselves to a large share of the guilt which accompanies the crime  He offers not he says to palliate or extenuate the crimes he himself has been guilty of But laments for Mr Lovelace's own sake that he gives him with so ludicrous and unconcerned  an air such solemn and useful Lessons and Warnings Nevertheless he resolves to make it his whole endeavour he tells him to render them efficacious to himself And should think himself but too happy if he shall be enabled to set him such an example as may be a means to bring about the Reformation of a man so dear to him as he has always been from the first of their acquaintance and who is capable of thinking so rightly and deeply tho' at present to such little purpose as makes his very Knowlege add to his Condemnation  Vol  vii  p    l    after  pursue his vengeance  insert  And the rather as thro' an absence of six years high as just report and the promises of her early youth from childhood had raised her in his esteem he could not till now know one half of her excellenciesTill now that we have lost for ever lost the admirable creature  But I will force myself from the subject  c  Vol  vii  p    l    from the bottom after  all the authority with her that dele  the rest of that and the following Paragraph and read  A Mother ought to have Miss Howe is indeed a woman of fine sense but it requires a high degree of good understanding as well as a sweet and gentle disposition of mind and great discretion in a child when grown up to let it be seen that she mingles  Reverence  with her  Love  to a Parent who has talents visibly inferior to her own  Miss Howe is  open generous noble  The Mother has not any of her fine qualities Parents in order to preserve their childrens veneration for them should take great care not to let them see anything in their conduct or behaviour or principles which they themselves would not approve of in others  Mr Hickman has however this consideration to comfort himself with that the same vivacity by which  he  suffers makes Miss Howe's own  Mother  at times  equally sensible  And as he sees enough of this beforehand he will have more reason to blame himself than the Lady should she prove as lively a Wife as she was a Mistress for having continued his addresses and married her against such threatening appearances  There is also another circumstance which goodnatured men who engage with even lively women may look forward to with pleasure a circumstance which generally lowers the spirits of the Ladies and  domesticates  them as I may call it And which as it will bring those of Mr Hickman and Miss Howe nearer to a par that worthy gentleman will have  double  reason when it happens to congratulate himself upon it  But after all  c  Vol  vii  p    l penult after  will confirm this dele  the four following Paragraphs and read  In her dress she was elegant beyond imitation and generally led the fashion to all the Ladies round her without seeming to intend it and without being proud of doing so  She was rather tall than of a midling stature and had a dignity in her aspect and air that bespoke the mind that animated every feature  This  native  dignity as I may call it induced some superficial persons who knew not how to account for the reverence which involuntarily filled their hearts on her appearance to impute pride to her But these were such as knew that they should have been proud of any  one  of her perfections Judging therefore by their own narrowness they thought it impossible that the Lady who possessed  so many  should not think herself superior to them all  Indeed I have heard her noble aspect found fault with as indicating pride and superiority But people  awed and controuled tho' but by their own consciousness of inferiority will find fault right or wrong with those of whose rectitude of mind and manners their own culpable hearts give them to be afraid But in the bad sense of the word Miss Clarissa Harlowe knew not what pride was  You may if you touch upon this subject  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  to condemn it  insert  Once I remember in a large circle of Ladies every one of which I among the rest having censured a generally reported indiscretion in a young LadyCome my Miss Howe said she for we had agreed to take each other to task when either thought the other gave occasion for it and when by blaming each other we intended a  general  reprehension which as she used to say it would appear arrogant or assuming to level  more properly  let  me  be Miss Fanny Darlington Then removing out of the circle and standing upHere I stand unworthy of a seat with the rest of the company till I have cleared my self And now suppose me to be her let  me  hear your charge and do  you  hear what the poor culprit can say to it in her own defence And then answering the  conjectural  and  unproved  circumstances by circumstances as  fairly  to be supposed  favourable  she brought off triumphantly the censured Lady and so much to every one's satisfaction that she was led to her chair and voted a double rank in the circleas the reinstated Miss Fanny Darlington and as Miss Clarissa Harlowe  'Very few persons she used to say would be condemned or even accused in the circles of Ladies were they present It is generous therefore nay it is but just said she to take the part of the absent if not flagrantly culpable'  But tho'  Wisdom  was her  birthright  as I may say yet she had not lived years enow to pretend to so much  experience  as to exempt her from the necessity of  sometimes altering her opinion both of persons and things But when she found herself obliged to do this she took care that the particular instance of mistaken worthiness in the person should not narrow or contract her almost universal charity into general doubt or jealousy An instance of what I mean occurs to my memory You must everywhere  c  Vol  vii  p  dele  the four last lines and p    line    after  caution and prudence  insert  Indeed when she was convinced of  any  error or mistake however seemingly derogatory to her judgment and sagacity no one was ever so acknowleging so ingenuous as she  'It was a merit she used to say next in degree to that of having avoided error frankly to own an error And that the offering at an excuse in a blameable matter was the undoubted mark of a disingenuous if not of a perverse mind'  But I ought to add on this head of her great charity where character was concerned and where there was  room  for charity that she was always deservedly severe in her reprehensions of a  wilful  and  studied  vileness How could she then forgive the wretch by whose  premeditated  villainy she was entangled  If you mention  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  with him than before  insert  And yet his behaviour before her was too specious to have been very exceptionable to a woman who had a less share of that charming delicacy and of that penetration which so much distinguished her  In obedience  c  Ibid  l    from the bottom after  discard him for ever  insert  She was an admirable mistress of all the graces of elocution The hand she wrote for the neat and  free cut of her letters like her mind solid and above all  flourish  for its fairness evenness and swiftness distinguished her as much as the correctness of her orthography and even punctuation from the generality of her own Sex and left her none amongst the most accurate of the other who excelled her  Her ingenuity  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  all natural beauty  insert  Then stiffened and starched Let  me  add into dry and indelectable affectation  one sort  of these scholars assume a style as rough as frequently are their manners They spangle over their productions with  metaphors  They rumble into  bombast  The  sublime  with them lying in  words  and not in  sentiment  they fansy themselves most exalted when least understood and down they sit fully satisfied with their own performances and call them MASCULINE While a  second  sort aiming at  wit  that wicked misleader forfeit all title to  judgment  And a  third  sinking into the  classical pits  there poke and scramble about never seeking to shew genius of their own all their lives spent in commonplace  quotation  fit only to write  Notes  and  Comments  upon other peoples  Texts  all their pride that they know those beauties of two thousand years old in another tongue which they can only  admire  but not  imitate  in their own  And these truly must be learned men and despisers of our  insipid  Sex  But I need not mention the exceptions which my beloved friend always made and to which I subscribe in favour of men of sound learning true taste and extensive abilities Nor in particular her respect even to reverence for gentlemen of the cloth Which I dare say will appear in every paragraph of her Letters whereever any of the Clergy are mentioned Indeed the pious Dr Lewen the worthy Dr Blome the ingenious  Mr Arnold and Mr Tompkins gentlemen whom she names in one article of her will as learned Divines with whom she held an early correspondence well deserved her respect since to their conversation and correspondence she owed many of her valuable acquirements  Nor were the little slights she would nowandthen following as I must own my lead put upon such  mere  scholars And her stupid and pedantic Brother was one of those who deserved those slights as despised not only  our Sex  but all such as had not had their opportunities of being acquainted with the  Parts of Speech  I cannot speak low enough of such and with the dead Languages owing to that contempt which some affect for what they have not been able to master for she had an admirable facility in learning languages and re'd with great ease both Italian and French She had begun to apply herself to Latin and having such a critical knowlege of her own tongue and such a foundation from the two others would soon have made herself an adept in it  And one hint  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  what she acquires dele  the two next Paragraphs and read  'All that a woman  can  learn she used to say expatiating on this maxim above the useful knowlege proper to her Sex  let her learn  This will shew that she is a good housewife of her time and that she not a narrow or confined genius But then let her not give up for these those  more necessary  and therefore not  meaner  employments which will qualify her to be a  good Mistress  of a family a  good Wife  and a  good Mother  For what can be more disgraceful to a woman than either thro' negligence of  dress  to be found to be a  learned Slattern  or thro' ignorance of  housholdmanagement  to be known to be a stranger to domestic oeconomy'  Then would she instance to me two particular Ladies one of which while she was fond of giving  her  opinion in the company of her Husband and of his learned friends upon doubtful or difficult passages in Virgil or Horace knew not how to put on her cloaths with that necessary grace and propriety which should preserve to her the love of her Husband and the respect of every other person While the other affecting to be thought as learned as men could find no better way to assert her pretensions than by despising her own Sex and by dismissing that characteristic delicacy the loss of which no attainment can supply  She would have it indeed sometimes from the frequent ill use learned Women make of that respectable acquirement that it was no great matter whether the Sex aimed at anything but excelling in the knowlege of the beauties and graces of their mothertongue And once she said that this was field enough for a woman and an ampler was but endangering her family usefulness But I who think our Sex inferior in nothing to the other but in want of opportunities of which the narrowminded mortals industriously seek to deprive us lest we should surpass them as much in what they chiefly value themselves upon as we do in all the graces of a fine imagination could never agree with her in  that  And yet I was entirely of her opinion that those women who were solicitous to obtain that knowlege or learning which they supposed would add to their significance in sensible company and in their attainment of it imagined themselves above all domestic usefulness deservedly incurred the contempt which they hardly ever failed to meet with  Perhaps you will not think it amiss  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  who saw her in it dele  that and the following Paragraph and read  Her Grandfather in honour of her dexterity and of her skill in all the parts of the dairymanagement as well as of the elegance of the offices allotted for that use would have his Seat before known by the name of  The Grove  to be called  The Dairyhouse  She had an easy convenient and graceful habit made on purpose which she put on when she employed herself in these works and it was noted of her that in  the same hour  that she appeared to be a most elegant Dairymaid she was when called to a change of dress the finest Lady that ever graced a circle  Her Grandfather Father Mother Uncles Aunt and even her Brother and Sister made her frequent visits there and were delighted with her silent ease and unaffected behaviour in her works for she always out of modesty chose rather the  operative  than the  directive  part that she might not discourage the servant whose proper business it was  Each was fond of taking a regale from her hands in her  Dairyhouse  Her Mother and Aunt Hervey generally admired her in silence that they might not give uneasiness to her Sister a spiteful perverse unimitating thing who usually looked upon her all the time with speechless envy Nowandthen however the pouting creature would suffer extorted and sparing praise to burst open her lips though looking at the same time like Saul meditating the pointed javelin at the heart of David the glory of his kingdom And now methinks I see my Angelfriend too superior to take notice of her gloom courting her acceptance of the milkwhite curd from hands more pure than that  Her skill and dexterity in every branch of family management seem to be the only excellence of her innumerable ones which she owed to her family Whose narrowness immensely rich and immensely  carking put them upon indulging her in the turn she took to this part of knowlege while her elder Sister affected dress without being graceful in it and the Fine Lady which she could never be and which her Sister was without studying for it or seeming to know she was so  It was usual with the one Sister when company was expected to be half the morning dressing while the other would give directions for the whole business and entertainment of the day and then go up to her dressingroom and before she could well be missed  having all her things in admirable order  come down fit to receive company and with all that graceful ease and tranquillity as if she had had nothing else to think of  Long after  her  hours perhaps of previous preparation having passed down would come rustling and bustling the tawdry and aukward Bella disordering more her native disorderliness at the sight of her serene Sister by her sullen envy to see herself so much surpassed with such little pains and in a sixth part of the time  Yet was this admirable creature mistress of all these domestic qualifications without the least intermixture of narrowness She knew how to distinguish between  Frugality  a necessary virtue and  Niggardliness  an odious vice And used to say  'That to define Generosity it must be called the happy medium betwixt parsimony and profusion'  She was the most graceful  Reader  I ever knew She added by her melodious voice graces to those she found in the parts of books she re'dout to her friends and gave grace and significance to others where they were not She had no tone no whine Her accent was always admirably placed The emphasis she always forcibly laid as the subject required No buskinelevation no tragedypomp could mislead her and yet poetry was poetry  indeed  when she re'd it  But if her voice was melodious when she  re'd  it was all harmony when she  sung  And the delight she gave by that and by her skill and great compass was heightened by the ease and gracefulness of her air and manner and by the alacrity with which she obliged  Nevertheless she generally chose rather to hear others sing or play than either to play or sing herself  She delighted to give praise where deserved Yet she always bestowed it in such a manner as gave not the least suspicion that she laid out for a return of it to herself tho' so universally allowed to be her due  She had a talent of saying uncommon things in such an easy manner that everybody thought they could have said the same and which yet required both genius and observation to say them  Even severe things appeared gentle tho' they lost not their force from the sweetness of her air and utterance and the apparent benevolence of her purpose  We form the truest judgment of persons by their behaviour on the  most familiar  occasions I will give an instance or two of the correction she favoured me with on such a one  When  very young  I was guilty of the fault of those who want to be courted to sing She cured me of it at the first of our happy intimacy by her own  example  and by the following correctives occasionally yet privately enforced  'Well my dear shall we take you at your word Shall we suppose that you sing but indifferently Is not however the  act of obliging  the company so worthy preferable to the  talent of singing  And shall not young Ladies endeavour to make up for their defects in  one part  of education by their excellence in  another  '  Again  'You must convince us by attempting to sing that you  cannot  sing and then we will rid  you not only of  present  but of  future  importunity'  An indulgence however let me add that but  tolerable  singers do not always wish to meet with  Again  'I know you will favour us byandby and what do you by your excuses but raise our expectations and enhance your own difficulties'  At another time  'Has not this accomplishment been a part of your  education  my Nancy How then for  your own  honour can we allow of your excuses'  And I once pleading a cold the usual pretence of those who love to be entreated  'Sing however my dear  as well as you can  The greater the difficulty to you the higher the compliment to the company Do you think you are among those who know not how to make allowances You  should  sing my Love lest there should be anybody present who may think your excuses owing to affectation'  At another time when I had  truly  observed that a young Lady present sung better than I and that therefore I chose not to sing before that Lady'Fie' said she drawing me on one side  'Is not this pride my Nancy Does it not look as if your principal motive to oblige was to obtain applause A generous mind will not scruple to give advantage to a  person of merit  tho' not always to  her own  advantage And yet she will have a high merit  in doing that  Supposing this excelling person absent who my dear if your example spread shall sing after  you  You know every one  else  must be but as a foil to you Indeed I must have you as much superior to other Ladies in these  smaller  points as you are in  greater  '  So she was pleased to say to shame me  She was as much above Reserve  c  Vol  vii  p    l    from the bottom after  the sweet instructress dele  the two next Paragraphs and read  She had a pretty hand at drawing which she obtained  with a very little instruction Her time was too much taken up to allow tho' to so fine an art the attention which was necessary to make her greatly excel in it And she used to say  'That she was afraid of aiming at  too many  things for fear she should not be tolerable at  anything  '  For her years and her opportunities she was an extraordinary judge of Painting In this as in everything else  Nature  was her  Art  her  Art  was  Nature  She even prettily performed in it Her Grandfather for this reason bequeathed to her all the family pictures Charming was her fancy Alike sweet and easy was every touch of her pencil and her pen Yet her judgment exceeded her performance She did not practise enough to excel in the executive part She could not in everything excel But upon the whole she knew what every subject required according to the nature of it In other words was an absolute Mistress of the  shouldbe    To give a familiar instance for the sake of young Ladies she untaught observed  when but a child  that the Sun Moon and Stars never appeared at once and were therefore never to be in one piece That bears tygers lions were not natives of an English climate and should not therefore have place in an English landschape That these ravagers of the forest consorted not with lambs kids or fawns Nor kites hawks and vulturs with doves partridges and pheasants  And alas she knew before she was nineteen years of age by fatal experience she knew that all these beasts and birds of prey were outdone in treacherous cruelty by MAN Vile barbarous plotting destructive MAN who infinitely less excuseable than those destroys thro' wantonness and sport what those only destroy thro' hunger and necessity  The mere pretenders to those branches of Science which she aimed at acquiring she knew how to detect  and all from  Nature Propriety  another word for Nature was as I have hinted her Law as it is the foundation of all true judgment But nevertheless she was always uneasy if what she said exposed those pretenders to knowlege even in their  absence  to the ridicule of lively spirits  Let the  modern  Ladies who have not any one of her excellent qualities whose whole time in the short days they generally make and in the inverted night and day where they make them longer is wholly spent in dress visits cards plays operas and musical entertainments wonder at what I have written and shall further write And let them look upon it as an incredible thing that when at a maturer age they cannot boast one of her perfections there should have been a Lady so young who had so many  These must be such as know not how she employ'd her time and cannot form the least idea of what may be done in those hours in which they lie  enveloped with the shades of death  as she used to call sleep  But before I come to mention the distribution she usually made of her time let me say a few words upon another subject in which she excelled all the young Ladies I ever knew  This was her skill in almost all sorts of fine Needleworks Of which however I shall say the less since possibly you will find it mentioned in some of the Letters  That piece which she bequeaths  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  and not presents dele  to the words  against playing high  and read  As to her diversions the accomplishments and acquirements she was mistress of will shew what they must have been She was far from being fond of  Cards  the fashionable foible of modern Ladies Nor as will be easily perceived from what I have said and more from what I shall further say had she much time for  Play She never therefore promoted their being called for and often insensibly diverted the Company from them by starting some entertaining subject when she could do it without incurring the imputation of particularity  Indeed very few of her intimates would propose Cards if they could engage her to read to talk to touch the keys or to sing when any new book or new piece of music came down But when company was so numerous that conversation could not take that agreeable turn which it oftenest does among four or five friends of like years and inclinations and it became in a manner necessary to detach off some of it to make the rest better company she would not refuse to play if upon castingin it fell to her lot And then she shewed that her disrelish to cards was the effect of choice only and that she was an easy mistress of every genteel game played with them But then she always declared against playing high Except for trifles  c  Vol  vii  p    l    from the bottom after  what is our neighbour's dele  the four next Paragraphs and read  She was exceedingly charitable the only one of her family that knew the meaning of the word And this with regard both to the souls and the bodies of those who were the wellchosen objects of her benevolence She kept a list of these whom she used to call  her Poor  entering one upon it as another was provided for by death or any other way But always made a reserve nevertheless for unforeseen cases and for accidental distresses And it must be owned that in the prudent distribution of them she had neither Example nor Equal  The Aged the Blind the Lame the Widow the Orphan the unsuccessful Industrious were particularly the objects of it and the contributing to the schooling  of some to the putting out to trades and husbandry the children of others of the labouring or needy poor aod setting them forward at the expiration of their servitude were her great delights as was the giving good books to others and when she had opportunity the instructing the poorer sort of her honest neighbours and Father's tenants in the use of them  'That charity she used to say which provides for the  morals  as well as for the  bodily wants  of the poor gives a double benefit to the  Public  as it adds to the number of the  hopeful  what it takes from that of the  profligate  And can there be in the eyes of that God she was wont to say who requires nothing so much from us as acts of beneficence to one another a charity more worthy'  Her Uncle Antony when he came to settle in England with his vast fortune obtained in the Indies used to say  'This girl by her charities will bring down a blessing upon us all'  And it must be owned they trusted pretty much to this presumption  But I need not say more on this head nor perhaps was it necessary to say so much since the charitable bequests in her Will sufficiently set forth her excellence in this branch of duty  She was extremely moderate in her diet  '  Quantity  in food' she used to say was more to be regarded 'than  quality  That a full meal was the great enemy both to study and industry That a wellbuilt house required but little repairs'  By this moderation in her diet she enjoyed with a delicate frame of body a fine state of health was always serene lively chearful of course And I never knew but of one illness she had and that was by a violent cold caught in an open chaise by a sudden storm of hail and rain in a place where was no shelter and which threw her into a fever attended with dangerous symptoms that no doubt were lightened by her temperance but which gave her friends  who  then  knew her value infinite apprehensions for her  In her Commonplacebook she has the following note upon the recollection of this illness in the time of her distress  'In a dangerous illness with which I was visited a few years before I had the unhappiness to know this ungrateful man Would to Heaven I had died in it my Bed was surrounded by my dear Relations Father Mother brother Sister my two Uncles weeping kneeling round me then put up their vows to Heaven for my recovery and I fearing that I should drag down with me to my grave one or other of my sorrowing friends wished and prayed to recover for  their  sakesAlas how shall Parents in such cases know what to wish for How happy for them and for me had I then been denied to their prayers But now am I eased of that care All those dear Relations are living stillBut not one of them such as they think has been the heinousness of my error but far from being grieved would rejoice to heat of my death'    In all her Readings and in her Conversations upon them she was fonder of finding beauties than blemishes and chose to applaud both Authors and Books where she could find the least room for it Yet she used to lament that certain writers of the first class who were capable of exalting virtue and of putting vice out of countenance too generally employed themselves in works of  imagination only  upon subjects  merely speculative disinteresting  and  unedifying  from which no useful moral or example could be drawn  But she was a severe Censurer of pieces of a  light  or  indecent  turn which had a tendency to corrupt the morals of youth to convey polluted images or to wound religion whether in itself or thro' the sides of its professors and this whoever were the authors and how admirable soever the execution She often pitied the celebrated Dr Swift for so employing his admirable pen that a pure eye was afraid of looking into his works and a pure ear of hearing anything quoted from them 'Such authors' she used to say  'were nor  hones  to their own talents nor grateful to the God who gave them'  Nor would she on these occasions admit their beauties as a palliation on the contrary she held it as an aggravation of their crime  that they who were so capable of  mending the heart  should in any places shew a  corrupt one  in themselves which must weaken the influences of their good works and pull down with one hand what they built up with the other  All she said and all she did was accompanied with a natural ease and dignity which set her above affectation or the suspicion of it insomuch that that degrading fault so generally imputed to a learned woman was never laid to her charge For with all her excellencies she was forwarder to  hear  than  speak  and hence no doubt derived no small part of her improvement  Altho' she was well read in the English French and Italian Poets and had read the best translations of the Latin Classics yet seldom did she quote or repeat from them either in her Letters or Conversation tho' exceedingly happy in a tenacious memory principally thro' modesty and to avoid the imputation of that  affectation  which I have just mentioned  Mr Wyerley once said of her she had such a fund of knowlege of her own and made naturally such fine observations upon persons and things being capable  by the Egg  that was his familiar expression  of judging of the  BIRD that she had seldom either room or necessity for foreign assistances  But it was plain from her whole conduct and behaviour that she had not so good an opinion of herself however deserved since whenever she was urged to give her sentiments on any subject altho' all she thought fit to say was clear and intelligible yet she seemed in haste to have done speaking Her reason for it I know was twofold That she might not lose the benefit of other peoples sentiments by engrossing the conversation and lest as were her words she should be praised into  loquaciousness  and so forfeit the good opinion which a person always maintains with her friends who knows when she has said enough It was finally a rule with her  'to leave her hearers  wishing her to say more rather than to give them cause to shew by their  inattention  an uneasiness that she had said so much'  You are curious to know  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  Age and Sex  insert  Her Sex  did I say What honour to the  other  does this imply When one might challenge the proudest Pedant of them all to say he has been  disciplined  into greater improvement than she had made from the mere force of genius and application But it is demonstrable to all who know how to make observations on their acquaintance of both Sexes arrogant as some are of their superficialities that a Lady at Eighteen take the world thro' is more prudent and conversable than a man at Twentyfive I can prove this by Nineteen instances out of Twenty in my own knowlege Yet how do these poor boasters value themselves upon the advantages their education gives them Who has not seen some one of them just come from the University disdainfully smile at a mistaken or illpronounced  word  from a Lady when her  sense  has been clear and her sentiments just and when he could not himself utter a single sentence fit to be repeated but what he borrowed from the authors he had been obliged to study as a painful exercise to slow and creeping parts But how I digress  This excellent young Lady used to say  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  dispensed with her rules  insert  in mere indulgence to my foibles and idler habits for I also tho' I had the benefit of an example I so much admired am too much of a  Modern  Yet as to  morning Risings  I had corrected myself by such a precedent in the summertime and can witness to the benefit I found by it in my health as also to the many useful things I was

impatience in my temper to observe such a regularity in accounting between me and myself I satisfied myself in a  Lump Account  as I may call it if I had nothing greatly wrong to reproach myself with when I looked back on a past week as she had taught me to do  For she used indulgently to say  'I do not think ALL I do necessary for another to do Nor even for myself But when it is more pleasant to me to keep such an account than to let it alone why may I not proceed in my supererogatoriesThere can be no harm in it It keeps up my attention to accounts which one day may be of use to me in more material instances Those who will not keep a  strict  account seldom long keep  any  I neglect not more useful employments for it And it teaches me to be covetous of Time the only thing of which we can be  allowably  covetous since we live but once in this world and when gone are gone from it for ever'  She always reconciled the necessity under which these  interventions  as she called them laid her of nowandthen breaking into some of her appropriations saying  'There was good sense and good manners too in the common lesson  When at Rome do as they do at Rome  And that to be easy of persuasion in matters where one could oblige without endangering virtue or worthy habits was an Apostolical excellency since if a person conformed with a view of making herself an interest in her friend's affecti  ns in order to be heeded in greater points it was imitating his example who  became all things to all men that he might gain some  '  Nor is it to be doubted had life been spared her that the sweetness of her temper and her chearful piety would have made Virtue and Religion appear so lovely that her example would have  had no small influence upon the minds and manners of those who would have had the honour of conversings with her  O Mr Belford  c  Vol  vii  p  dele  the two last paragraphs and read  And still the less as the inconsolable Mother rested not till she had procured by means of Colonel Morden large extracts from some of the Letters that compose this History which convinced them all that the very correspondence which Clarissa while with them renewed with Mr Lovelace was renewed for  their sakes  more than for  her own  That she had given him no encouragement contrary to her duty and to that prudence for which she was so early noted That had they trusted to a discretion which they owned she had never brought into question she would have extricated them and herself as she once proposed  See Vol I p  to her Mother from all difficulties as to Lovelace That she if any woman ever could would have given a glorious instance of a passion conquered or at least kept under by Reason and by Piety the man being too immoral to be implicitly beloved  The unhappy Parents and Uncles from the perusal of these Extracts too evidently for their peace saw That it was entirely owing to the avarice the ambition the envy of her implacable Brother and Sister and to the senseless confederacy entered into by the whole family to compel her to give her hand to a man she must despise or she had not been a CLARISSA and to their consequent persecutions of her that she ever thought of quitting her Father's house And that even when she first entertained such a thought it was with intent if possible to procure for herself a private asylum with Mrs Howe or at some other place of safety but not with Mr Lovelace nor with any of the  Ladies of his family tho' invited by the latter from whence she might propose terms which ought to have been complied with and which were entirely consistent with her dutyThat tho' she found herself disappointed of the hopedfor refuge and protection she intended not by meeting Mr Lovelace to put herself into his power all that she aimed at by taking that step being to endeavour to pacify so fierce a spirit lest he should as he indeed was determined to do pay a visit to her friends which might have been attended with fatal consequences but was spirited away by him in such a manner as made her an object of pity rather than of blame  These Extracts further convinced them all that it was to her unaffected regret that she found that Marriage was not in her power afterwards for a long time and at last but on one occasion when their unnatural cruelty to her on a new application she had made to her Aunt Hervey to procure mercy and pardon rendered her incapable of receiving his proffer'd hand and so obliged her to suspend the day intending only to suspend it till recovered  They saw with equal abhorrence of Lovelace and of their own cruelty and with the highest admiration of her That the majesty of her virtue had awed the most daring spirit in the world so that he durst not attempt to carry his base designs into execution till by wicked potions he had made her senses the previous sacrifice  But how did they in a manner adore her memory How did they recriminate upon each other when they found that she had not only preserved herself from repeated outrage by the most glorious and intrepid behaviour in defiance and to the utter confusion of all his Libertine notions but had the fortitude constantly and with a noble disdain to reject HimWhomWhy the Man she once could have loved kneeling for pardon and begging to be permitted  to make her the best reparation then in his power to make her that is to say by Marriage His fortunes high and unbroken She his prisoner at the time in a vile house Rejected by all her friends upon repeated application to them for mercy and forgiveness rejectedMercy and forgiveness and a last blessing afterwards imploring and that as much to lighten their future remorses as for the comfort of her own pious heartYet tho' savagely refused on a supposition that she was not so near her End as was represented departed forgiving and blessing them all  Then they recollected that her posthumous Letters instead of reproaches were filled with comfortings That she had in her Last Will in their own way laid obligations upon them all obligations which they neither deserved nor expected as if she thought to repair the injustice which selfpartiality made some of them conclude done to them by her Grandfather in his Will  These intelligences and recollections were perpetual subjects of recrimination to them Heightened their anguish for the loss of a child who was the glory of their family and not seldom made them shun each other at the times they were accustomed to meet together that they might avoid the mutual reproaches of Eyes that spoke when Tongues were silent Their stings also sharpened by time what an unhappy family was This Well might Colonel Morden in the words of Juvenal challenge all other miserable families to produce such a growing distress

MARTIN and POLLY HORTON had abilities and education superior to what creatures of their cast generally can boast of and as their Histories are nowhere given in the preceding Papers in which they are frequently mentioned it cannot fail of gratifying the reader's curiosity  as well  as answering the  good ends  designed by the publication of this Work to give a brief account of their Parentage and manner of Trainingup preparative to the vile courses they fell into and of what became of them after the dreadful exit of the infamous Sinclair  SALLY MARTIN was the Daughter of a substantial Mercer at the Court end of the town to whom her Mother a Grocer's Daughter in the city brought a handsome fortune and both having a gay turn and being fond of the fashions which it was their business to promote and which the wives and daughters of the uppermost tradesmen especially in that quarter of the town generally affect to follow it was no wonder that they brought up their Daughter accordingly Nor that she who was a very sprightly and readywitted girl and reckoned very pretty and very genteel should every year improve upon such examples  She early found herself mistress of herself All she did was right All she said was admired Early very early did she dismiss blushes from her cheek She could not blush because she could not doubt And silence whatever were the subject was as much a stranger to her as diffidence  She never was left out of any party of pleasure after she had passed her Ninth year and in honour of her prattling vein was considered as a principal person in the frequent Treats and Entertainments which her parents fond of luxurious living gave with a view to encrease their acquaintance for the sake of their businese Not duly reflecting that the part they suffered her to take in what made for their interest would probably be a means to quicken the appetites and ruin the morals of that Daughter for whose sake as an only child they were solicitous to obtain wealth  The CHILD so much a Woman what must the WOMAN be  At Fifteen or Sixteen she affected both in dress and manners to ape such of the quality as were most Apish The richest silks in her Father's shop were not too rich for her At all public diversions she was the leader instead of the led of all her female kindred and acquaintance tho' they were a third older than herself She would bustle herself into a place and make room for her more bashful companions through the frowns of the first possessors at a crouded theatre leaving every one near her amazed at her selfconsequence wondering she had no servant to keep place for her whisperingly enquiring who she was and then sitting down admiring her fortitude  She officiously made herself of consequence to the most noted Players who as one of their patronesses applied to her for her interest on their Benefitnights She knew the  Christian  as well as  Sur  Name of every pretty fellow who frequented public places and affected to speak of them by their former  Those who had not obeyed the call her eyes always made upon all of them for notice at her entrance or before she took her seat were spoken of with haughtiness as Jack's or Tom's while her  favourites with an affectedlyendearing familiarity and a prettiness of accent were Jackeys and Tommys and if they stood very high in her graces Dear Devils and Agreeable Toads  She sat in judgment and an inexorable judge she was upon the actions and conduct of every man and woman of quality and fashion as they became the subjects of conversation She was deeply learned in the scandalous Chronicle She made every character every praise and every censure serve to exalt herself  She should scorn to do so or so  Or  That was ever her way  and  just what she did or liked to do  and judging herself by the vileness of the most vile of her Sex she wiped her mouth and sat down satisfied witli her own virtue  She had her Chair to attend her whereever she went and found people among her  Betters  as her pride stooped to call some of the most insignificant people in the world to encourage her visits  She was practised in all the arts of the Cardtable A true Spartan girl and had even courage occasionally to wrangle off a detection Late hours turning night into day and day into night were the almost unavoidable consequence of her frequent play Her parents pleased themselves that their Sally had a charming constitution And as long as she suffered not in her health they were regardless of her morals  The Needle she hated And made the constant subjects of her ridicule the fine works that used to employ and to keep out of idleness luxury and extravagance and at  home  were they to have been of no other service the women of the last age when there were no Vauxhalls Ranelaghs Marybones and suchlike places of diversion to dress out for and gad after  And as to Familymanagement her parents had not required any knowlege of that sort from her and she considered it as a qualification only necessary  for hirelings and the lowborn and as utterly unworthy of the attention of a modern fine Lady  Altho' her Father had great business yet living in so high and expensive a way he pretended not to give her a fortune answerable to it Neither he nor his Wife having set out with any notion of frugality could think of retrenching Nor did their Daughter desire that they should retrench They thought glare or ostentation reputable They called it living  genteelly  And as they lifted their heads above their neighbours they supposed their credit concerned to go forward rather than backward in outward appearances They flattered themselves and they flattered their girl and she was  entirely  of their opinion that she had charms and wit enough to attract some man of rank of  Fortune  at least And yet this Daughter of a MercerFather and GrocerMother could not bear the thoughts of a creeping Cit encouraging herself with the few instances  comparatively  few which she had always in her head as  common ones  of girls much inferior to herself in station talents education and even fortune who had succeededas she doubted not to succeed Handsome Settlements and a Chariot that tempting gewgaw to the vanity of the middling class of females were the least that she proposed to herself But all this while neither her parents nor herself considered that she had appetites indulged to struggle with and a turn of education given her as well as a warm constitution unguarded by sound principles and unbenefited by example which made her much better qualified for a Mistress than a Wife  Her Twentieth year to her own equal wonder and regret passed over her head and she had not had one offer that her pride would permit her to accept of A girl from Fifteen to Eighteen her beauty then beginning to blossom will as a new thing attract the eyes of men But if she make her face cheap at public places she will find that  new  faces will draw more attention  than  fine  faces constantly seen Policy therefore if nothing else were considered would induce a young Beauty if she could tame her vanity just to shew herself and to be talked of and then withdrawing as if from discretion and discreet it will be to do so expect to be  sought after  rather than to be thought to  seek for  only reviving nowandthen the memory of herself at the public places in turn if she find herself likely to be forgotten and then she will be new again But this observation ought young Ladies always to have in their heads that they can hardly ever expect to gratify their vanity and at the same time gain the admiration of men worthy of making partners for life They may in short have many admirers at public places but not one Lover  Sally Martin knew nothing of this doctrine Her beauty was in its bloom and yet she found herself neglected  'Sally Martin the Mercer's Daughter she never fails being here'  was the answer and the accompanying observation made to every Questioner Who is that Lady  At last her destiny approached It was at a Masquerade that she first saw the gay the handsome Lovelace who was just returned from his travels She was immediately struck with his figure and with the brilliant things that she heard fall from his lips as he happened to sit near her He who was not then looking out for a Wife was taken with Sally's smartness and with an air that at the same time shewed her to be equally genteel and selfsignificant and signs of approbation mutually passing he found no difficulty in acquainting himself where to visit her next day And yet it was some mortification to a person of her selfconsequence and gay appearance to submit to be known by so fine a young gentleman as no more than a Mercer's daughter So natural is it for a girl brought up as Sally was to be occasionally ashamed of those whose folly had set her above herself  But whatever it might be to Sally it was no disappointment to Mr Lovelace to find his Mistress of no higher degree because he hoped to reduce her soon to the lowest condition that an unhappy woman can fall into  But when Miss Martin had informed herself that her Lover was the Nephew and presumptive Heir of Lord M she thought him the very man for whom she had been so long and so impatiently looking out and for whom it was worth her while to spread her toils And here it may not be amiss to observe that it is very probable that Mr Lovelace had Sally Martin in his thoughts and perhaps two or three more whose hopes of marriage from him had led them to their ruin when he drew the following whimsical picture in a Letter to his friend Belford not inserted in the preceding Collection  'Methinks says he I see a young couple in courtship having each a design upon the other The girl plays off She is very happy as she is She cannot be happier She will not change her single state The man I will suppose is one who does not  confess  that he desires not that she  should  She holds ready a net under her apron he another under his coat each intending to throw it over the other's neck she over his when her pride is gratified and she thinks she can be sure of him he over hers when the watchedfor yielding moment has carried consent  too far  And suppose he happens to be the more dextrous of the two and whips his net over her before she can cast hers over him how I would fain know can she be justly entitled to cry out upon cruelty barbarity deception sacrifices and all the rest of the exclamatory nonsense with which the pretty fools in such a case are wont to din the ears of their conquerors Is it not just thinkest thou when she makes her appeals to gods and men that both gods and men should laugh at her and hitting her in the teeth with her  own felonious intentions bid her sit down patiently under her deserved disappointment'  In short Sally's parents as well as herself encouraged Mr Lovelace's visits They thought they might trust to a discretion in her which she herself was too wise to doubt Pride they knew she had And that in these cases is often called discretion Lord help the Sex says Lovelace if they had not PrideNor did they suspect danger from that specious air of sincerity and gentleness of manners which he could assume or lay aside whenever he pleased  The second Masquerade which was no more than their third meeting abroad completed her ruin from so practised tho' so young a deceiver and that before she well knew she was in danger For having prevailed on her to go off with him about Twelve o'clock to his Aunt Forbes's a Lady of honour and fortune to whom he had given reason to expect her  future Niece  the only hint of Marriage he ever gave her he carried her to the house of the wicked woman who bears the name of Sinclair in these Papers And there by promises which she understood in the favourable sense for where a woman loves she seldom doubts enough for her own safety obtained an easy conquest over a virtue that was little more than nominal  He found it not difficult to induce her to proceed in the guilty commerce till the effects of it became too apparent to be hid Her Parents then in the first fury of their disappointment and vexation for being deprived of all hopes of such a Soninlaw turned her out of doors  Her disgrace thus published she became hardened and protected by her seducer whose favourite Mistress she then was she was so incensed against her Parents for an indignity so little suiting with her pride and the head they had always given her that she refused to return to them when repenting of their passonate treatment of her they would have been reconciled to her  And becoming the favourite Daughter of her Mother Sinclair at the persuasions of that abandoned woman she practised to bring on an abortion which she effected tho' she was so far gone that it had like to have cost her her life  Thus unchastity her first crime murder her next her conscience became seared and young as she was and fond of her deceiver soon grew indelicate enough having so thoroughpaced a Schoolmistress to do all she could to promote the pleasures of the man who had ruined her scrupling not with a spirit truly diabolical to endeavour to draw in others to follow her example And it is hardly to be believed what mischiefs of this sort she was the means of effecting woman confiding in and daring woman and she a creature of specious appearance and great art  A still viler wickedness if possible remains to be said of Sally Martin  Her Father dying her Mother in hopes to  reclaim  her as she called it proposed to her to quit the house of the infamous Sinclair and to retire with her into the country where her disgrace and her then wicked way of live would not be known and there so to life as to save appearances the only virtue she had ever taught her besides that of endeavouring rather to delude than to be deluded  To this Sally consented but with no other intention as she often owned and gloried in it than to cheat her Mother of the greatest part of her substance in revenge for consenting to her being turned out of doors long before and by way of reprisal for having persuaded her Father as she would have it to cut her off in his last Will from any share in his fortune  This unnatural wickedness in half a year's time she brought about and then the Serpent retired to her obscene den with her spoils laughing at what she had done even after it had broken her Mother's  heart as it did in a few months time A severe but just punishment for the unprincipled education she had given her  It ought to be added that this was an iniquity of which neither Mr Lovelace nor any of his friends could bear to hear her boast and always check'd her for it whenever she did condemning it with one voice And it is certain that this and other instances of her complicated wickedness turned early Lovelace's heart against her and had she not been subservient to him in his other pursuits he would not have endured her For speaking of her he would say Let not any one reproach  us  Jack  There is no wickedness like the wickedness of a woman  Ecclus xxv    A bad education was the preparative it must be confessed And for this Sally Martin had reason to thank her Parents As they had reason to thank themselves for what followed But had she not met with a Lovelace she had avoided a Sinclair and might have gone on at the common rate of wives so educated and been the Mother of children turned out to take their chance in the world as she was so many lumps of soft was fit to take any impression that the first accident gave them neither happy nor making happy everything but useful and well off if not extremely miserable  POLLY HORTON was the Daughter of a gentlewoman well descended whose Husband a man of family and of honour was a Captain in the Guards  He died when Polly was about Nine years of age leaving her to the care of her Mother a lively young Lady of about Twentysix with a genteel provision for both  Her Mother was extremely fond of her Polly but had it not in  herself  to manifest the true the genuine fondness of a Parent by a strict and guarded education dressing out and visiting and being visited by  the gay of her own Sex and casting out her eye abroad as one very ready to try her fortune again in the married state  This induced those airs and a love to those diversions which make a young widow of so lively a turn the unfittest Tutress in the world even to her own Daughter  Mrs Horton herself having had an early turn to Music and that sort of Reading which is but an earlier debauchery for young minds preparative to the grosser at riper years to wit Romances and Novels Songs and Plays and those without distinction moral or immoral she indulged her Daughter in the same taste and at those hours when they could not take part in the more active and lively amusements and  Killtimes  as some call them used to employ Miss to read to her happy enough in her own imagination that while she was diverting her own ears and sometimes as the piece was corrupting her own heart and her childs too she was teaching Miss to read and improve her mind for it was the boast of every teatable halfhour  That Miss Horton in propriety accent and emphasis surpassed all the young Ladies of her age  And at other times complimenting the pleased Mother  Bless me Madam with what a surprising grace Miss Horton readsShe enters into the very spirit of her subjectThis she could have from nobody but you  An intended praise but as the subjects were would have been a severe  satire  in the mouth of an enemy While the fond the inconsiderate Mother with a delighted air would cry  Why I cannot but say Miss Horton does credit to her Tutress  And then a  Comehither my best Love  And with a kiss of approbation  What a pleasure to your dear Papa had he lived to see your improvements my Charmer  Concluding with a sigh of satisfaction her eyes turning round upon the circle to take in all the silent applauses of theirs  But little thought the fond the foolish Mother what the plant would be which was springing up from these seeds Little imagined she that her own ruin as well as her child's was to be the consequence of this fine education and that in the same illfated hour the honour both of Mother and Daughter was to become a sacrifice to the intriguing Invader  This the laughing girl when abandoned to her evil destiny and in company with her Sister Sally and others each recounting their settingsout their progress and their fall frequently related to be her education and manner of trainingup  This and to see a succession of Humble Servants buzzing about a Mother who took too much pride in addresses of that kind what a beginning what an example to a constitution of tinder so prepared to receive the spark struck from the steely forehead and flinty heart of such a Libertine as at last it was their fortune to be encountered by  In short as Miss grew up under the influences of such a Directress and of books so light and frothy with the inflaming additions of Music Concerts Opera's Plays Assemblies Balls and the rest of the rabble of amusements of the modern life it is no wonder that like early fruit she was soon ripened to the hand of the insidious gatherer  At Fifteen she own'd she was ready to fansy herself the Heroine of every Novel and of every Comedy she read so well did she enter into the  spirit  of her subject She glowed to become the object of some Hero's flame and perfectly longed to begin an intrigue and even to be  run away with  by some enterprising Lover Yet had neither  Confinement  nor  Check  to apprehend from her indiscreet Mother Which she thought absolutely necessary to constitute a Parthenissa  Nevertheless with all these fine modern qualities did she complete her Nineteenth year before she met  with any address of consequence One half of her admirers being afraid because of her gay turn and but middling fortune to make serious applications for her favour while others were kept at distance by the superior airs she assumed and a third sort not sufficiently penetrating the foibles either of Mother or Daughter were kept off by the supposed watchful care of the former  But when the man of intrepidity and intrigue was found never was Heroine so soon subdued never Goddess so early stript of her celestials For at the Opera a diversion at which neither she nor her Mother ever missed to be present she beheld the specious Lovelace beheld him invested with all the airs of heroic insult resenting a slight affront offered to his Sally Martin by Two gentlemen who had known her in her more hopeful state one of whom Mr Lovelace obliged to sneak away with a broken head given with the pommel of his sword the other with a bloody nose neither of them well supporting that readiness of offence which it seems was a part of their  known  characters to be guilty of  The gallantry of this action drawing every bystander on the side of the Hero  O the brave man  cried Polly Horton aloud to her Mother in a kind of rapture  How needful the protection of the Brave to the Fair  with a softness in her voice which she had taught herself to suit her fansied  high  condition of life  A speech so much in his favour could not but take the notice of a man who was but too sensible of the advantages which his fine person and noble air gave him over the gentler hearts who was always watching every female eye and who had his ear continually turned to every affected voice for that was one of his indications of a proper subject to be attempted  Affectation of every sort  he used to say  is a certain sign of a wrongturned head of a faulty judgment And upon such a basis I seldom build in vain    He instantly resolved to be acquainted with a young creature who seemed so strongly prejudiced in his favour Never man had a readier invention for all sorts of mischief He gave his Sally her Cue He called her  Sister  in their hearing And Sally whisperingly gave the young Lady and her Mother in her own way the particulars of the affront she had received making herself an Angel of Light to cast the brighter ray upon the character of her heroic Brother She particularly praised his known and approved courage and mingled with her praises of him such circumstances relating to his birth his fortune and endowments as left him nothing to do but to fall in love with the enamoured Polly  Mr Lovelace presently saw what turn to give to his professions  So brave a man yet of manners so gentle  hit the young Lady's taste Nor could she suspect the heart that such an aspect cover'd  This was the man the very man  she whispered to her Mother And when the Opera was over his servant procuring a coach he undertook with his specious Sister to set them down at their own lodgings tho' situated a quite different way from his And there were they prevailed upon to alight and partake of a slight repast  Sally pressed them to return the favour to her at her Aunt Forbes's and hoped it would be before her Brother went to his own seat  They promised her and named their evening  A splendid entertainment was provided The guests came having in the interim found all that was said of his name and family and fortune to be true Persons of so little strictness in their own morals took it not into their heads to be very inquisitive after his  Music and dancing had their share in the entertainment These opened their hearts already halfopened by Love The  Aunt  Forbes and the Lover's Sister  kept  them open by their own example The Hero  sung vowed promised Their gratitude was moved their delights were augmented their hopes increased their confidence was engaged all their appetites up in arms the rich wines cooperating beat quite off their guard and not  Thought  enough remaining so much as for suspicion Miss detach'd from her Mother by Sally soon fell a sacrifice to the successful Intriguer  The widow herself half intoxicated and raised as she was with artful mixtures and inflamed by Love unexpectedly tendered by one of the libertines his constant companions to whom an  Opportunity  was contrived to be given to be alone with her and that closely followed by  Importunity  fell into her Daughter's error The consequences of which in length of time becoming apparent grief shame remorse seized her heart her own indiscretion not allowing her to arraign her Daughter's and she survived not her delivery leaving Polly with child likewise Who when delivered being too fond of the gay Deluder to renounce his company even when she found herself deluded fell into a course of extravagance and dissoluteness ran through her fortune in a very little time and as an high preferment at last with Sally was admitted a quarterpartner with the detestable Sinclair  All that is necessary to add to the History of these unhappy women will be comprised in a very little compass  After the death  c  Vol  vii  p    l    from the bottom on the words  deny it him  add the following Note  Several worthy persons have wished that the heinous practice of Duelling had been more forcibly discouraged by way of Note at the Conclusion of a work designed to recommend the  highest and most important Doctrines of Christianity  It is humbly presumed that those persons  have not sufficiently attended to what is already done on that subject in Vol  ii  Letter  x  and in Vol  vii  Letters  lxixxciiixcivxcv  Vol  vii  p    add the following  POSTSCRIPT  in which several Objections that have been made as well to the Catastrophe as to different Parts of the preceding History are briefly considered  The foregoing Work having been published at three different periods of time the Author in the course of its publication was favoured with many anonymous Letters in which the Writers differently expressed their wishes with regard to the apprehended catastrophe  Most of those directed to him by the gentler Sex turned in favour of what they called a  Fortunate Ending  Some of the fair writers enamoured as they declared with the character of the Heroine were warmly solicitous to have her made happy And others likewise of their mind  insisted that Poetical Justice  required that it should be so And when says one ingenious Lady whose undoubted motive was goodnature and humanity it must be concluded that it is in an author's power to make his piece end as he pleases why should he not give pleasure rather than pain to the Reader whom he has interested in favour of his principal characters  Others and some Gentlemen declared against Tragedies in general and in favour of Comedies almost in the words of Lovelace who was supported in his taste by all the women at Mrs Sinclair's and by Sinclair herself  'I have too much  Feeling  said he  See Vol IV p  There is enough in the world to make our hearts sad without carrying grief into our diversions and making the distresses of others our own'  And how was this happy ending to be brought about Why by this very easy and trite expedient  to wit by reforming Lovelace and marrying him to ClarissaNot however abating her one of her trials nor any of her sufferings for the sake of the sport her distresses would give to the  tenderhearted  reader as she went along the last outrage excepted That indeed partly in compliment to Lovelace himself and partly for delicacysake they were willing to spare her  But whatever were the fate of his work the Author was resolved to take a different method He always thought that  sudden Conversions  such especially as were left to the candour of the Reader to  suppose  and  make out  had neither  Art  nor  Nature  nor even  Probability  in them and that they were moreover of very  bad  example To have a Lovelace for a series of years glory in his wickedness and think that he had nothing to do but as an act of grace and favour to hold out his hand to receive that of the best of women whenever he pleased and to have it thought that Marriage would be a sufficient amends for all his enormities to others as well as to her he could not bear that Nor is Reformation as he has shewn in another piece to be secured by a fine face by a passion that has sense for its object nor by the goodness of a Wife's heart or even example if the heart of the Husband be not graciously touched by the Divine Finger  It will be seen by this time that the Author had a great end in view He has lived to see Scepticism and Infidelity openly avowed and even endeavoured to be propagated from the  Press  The great doctrines of the Gospel brought into question Those of selfdenial and mortification blotted out of the catalogue of christian virtues And a taste even to wantonness for outdoor pleasure and luxury to the general exclusion of domestic as well as public virtue industriously promoted among all ranks and degrees of people  In this general depravity when even the Pulpit has  lost great part of its weight and the Clergy are considered as a body of  interested  men the Author thought he should be able to answer it to his own heart be the success what it would if he threw in his mite towards introducing a Reformation so much wanted And he imagined that if in an age given up to diversion and entertainment he could  steal in  as may be said and investigate the great doctrines of Christianity under the fashionable guise of an amusement he should be most likely to serve his purpose remembring that of the Poet  A verse may find him who a sermon flies  And turn delight into a sacrifice  He was resolved therefore to attempt something that never yet had been done He considered that the Tragic poets have as seldom made their heroes true objects of pity as the Comic theirs laudable ones of imitation And still more rarely have made them in their deaths look forward to a  future Hope  And thus when they die they seem totally to perish Death in such instances must appear terrible It must be considered as the greatest evil But why is Death set in shocking lights when it is the universal lot  He has indeed thought fit to paint the death of the wicked as terrible as he could paint it But he has endeavoured to draw that of the good in such an amiable manner that the very Balaams of the world should not forbear to wish that their latter end might be like that of the Heroine  And after all what is the  Poetical Justice  so much contended for by some as the generality of writers have managed it but another sort of dispensation than that with which God by Revelation teaches us He has thought fit to exercise mankind whom placing here only in a state of probation he hath so intermingled good and evil as to necessitate us to look forward for a more equal dispensation of both  The Author of the History or rather Dramatic Narrative of Clarissa is therefore well justified by the  Christian System  in deferring to extricate suffering Virtue to the time in which it will meet with the  Completion  of its Reward  But we have no need  c  Vol    p    l  dele Thus far Mr Addison  and read  This subject is further considered in a Letter to the Spectator  See Spect Vol VII N  o      'I find your opinion says the author of it concerning the  lateinvented  term called  Poetical Justice  is controverted by some eminent critics I have drawn up some additional arguments to strengthen the opinion which you have there delivered having endeavoured to go to the bottom of that matter  'The most perfect man has vices enough to draw down punishments upon his head and to justify Providence in regard to any miseries that may befal him For this reason I cannot think but that the instruction and moral are much finer where a man who is virtuous in the main of his character falls into distress and sinks under the blows of fortune at the end of a Tragedy than when he is represented as happy and triumphant Such an example corrects the insolence of human nature softens the mind of the beholder with sentiments of pity and compassion comforts him under his own private affliction and teaches him not to judge of mens virtues by their successes  A caution that our Blessed Saviour himself gives in the case of the Eighteen persons killed by the fall of the tower of Siloam Luke xiiia  I cannot think of one real hero in all antiquity so far raised above human infirmities that he might not be very naturally represented in a Tragedy as plunged in misfortunes and calamities The Poet may still find out some prevailing passion or indiscretion in his character  and shew it in such a manner as will sufficiently acquit Providence of any injustice in his sufferings For as Horace observes the best man is faulty tho' not in so great a degree as those whom we generally call vicious men  Vitiis nemo sine nascitur optimus ille  Qui minimis urgetur    'If such a strict  Poetical Justice proceeds the Letterwriter  as some gentlemen insist upon were to be observed in this art there is no manner of reason why it should not extend to heroic Poetry as well as Tragedy But we find it so little observed in Homer that his Achilles is placed in the greatest point of glory and success tho' his Character is morally vicious and only  poetically  good if I may use the phrase of our modern Critics The  Aeneid  is filled with innocent unhappy persons Nisus and Euryalus Lausus and Pallas come all to unfortunate ends The Poet takes notice in particular that in the sacking of Troy Ripheus fell who was the most just man among the Trojans  'Cadit Ripheus justissimus unus  'Qui fuit in Teucris servantissimus aequi  'Diis aliter visum est  'The gods thought fitSo blameless Ripheus fell  'Who lov'd fair Justice and observ'd it well'  'And that Pantheus could neither be preserved by his transcendent piety nor by the holy fillets of Apollo whose priest he was  'Nec te tua plurima Pantheu  'Labentem pietas nec Apollinis infula texit  Aen II  'Nor could thy piety thee Pantheus save  'Nor ev'n thy priesthood from an early grave  'I might here mention the practice of antient Tragic Poets both Greek and Latin but as this particular  is touched upon in the paper abovementioned I shall pass it over in silence I could produce passages out of Aristotle in favour of my opinion And if in one place he says that an absolutely virtuous man should not be represented as unhappy this does not justify any one who should think fit to bring in an absolutely virtuous man upon the stage Those who are acquainted with that author's way of writing know very well that to take the whole extent of his subject into his divisions of it he often makes use of such cases as are imaginary and not reducible to practice  'I shall conclude  says this gentleman  with observing that tho' the  Spectator  abovementioned is so far against the rule of  Poetical Justice  as to affirm that good men may meet with an unhappy Catastrophe in Tragedy it does not say that ill men may go off unpunished The reason for this distinction is very plain namely because the best of men as is said above have faults enough to justify Providence for any misfortunes and afflictions which may befal them but there are many men so criminal that they can have no claim or pretence to happiness The  best  of men may deserve punishment but the  worst  of men cannot deserve happiness'  Mr Addison as we have seen above tells us that Aristotle in considering the Tragedies that were written in either of the kinds observes that those which ended unhappily had always pleased the people and carried away the prize in the public disputes of the Stage from those that ended happily  Our fair Readers  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  chasle and virtuous  insert  These are the great authorities so favourable to the stories that end unhappily And we beg leave to reinforce this inference from them That if the temporary sufferings of the Virtuous and the Good can be  accounted for and justified on Pagan principles many more and infinitely stronger reasons will occur to a Christian Reader in behalf of what are called unhappy Catastrophes from the consideration of the doctrine of  future rewards  which is everywhere strongly enforced in the History of Clarissa  Of this to give but one instance an ingenious Modern distinguished by his rank but much more by his excellent defence of some of the most important doctrines of Christianity appears convinced in the conclusion of a pathetic  Monody  not long ago published in which after he had deplored as a man  without hope  expressing ourselves in the Scripture phrase the loss of an excellent Wife he thus consoles himself  Yet O my soul thy rising murmurs stay  Nor dare th' Allwise Disposer to arraign  Or against his supreme decree  With impious grief complain  That all thy fullblown joys at once should fade  Was his most righteous Will And be that Will obey'd  Would thy fond love his grace to her controul  And in these low abodes of sin and pain  Her pure exalted soul  Unjustly for thy partial good detain  Norather strive thy grov'ling mind to raise  Up to that unclouded blaze  That heav'nly radiance of eternal light  In which enthron'd she now with pity sees  How frail how insecure how slight  Is ev'ry mortal bliss  But of infinitely greater weight than all that has been above produced on this subject are the words of the Psalmist  'As for me says he  Psalm lxxiii  my feet were almost gone my steps had wellnigh slipt For I was envious at  the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked For their strength is firm They are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other menTheir eyes stand out with fatness They have more than their heart could wishVerily I have cleansed mine heart in vain and washed my hands in innocence for all the day long have I been plagued and chastened every morning When I thought to know this it was too painful for me Until I went into the sanctuary of God then understood I their endThou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory'  This is the Psalmist's comfort and dependence And shall man presuming to alter the common course of nature and so far as he is able to elude the tenure by which frail mortality indispensably holds imagine that he can make a better dispensation and by calling it  Poetical Justice  indirectly reflect on the  Divine  The more pains have been taken to obviate the objections arising from the notion of  Poetical Justice  as the doctrine built upon it had obtained general credit among us and as it must be confessed to have the appearance of  humanity  and  goodnature  for its supports And yet the writer of the History of Clarissa  c  Vol  vii  p    l    after  Heaven only could reward  insert  We shall now according to expectation given in the  Preface  to this Edition proceed to take brief notice of such other objections as have come to our knowlege For as is there said  'This work being addressed to the Public as an History of  Life  and  Manners  those parts of it which are proposed to carry with them the force of Example ought to be as unobjectible as is consistent with the  design of the whole  and with  human Nature  '  Several persons have censured the Heroine as too  cold in her love too haughty and even sometimes provoking But we may presume to say that this objection has arisen from want of attention to the Story to the Character of Clarissa and to her particular Situation  It was not intended that she should be  in Love  but  in Liking  only if that expression may be admitted It is meant to be everywhere inculcated in the Story for  Examplesake  that she never would have married Mr Lovelace because of his immoralities had she been left to herself and that her ruin was principally owing to the persecutions of her friends  What is too generally called  Love  ought perhaps  as  generally to be called by another name  Cupidity  or a  Paphian Stimulus  as some women even of condition have acted are not words too harsh to be substituted on the occasion however grating they may be to delicate ears But take the word  Love  in the gentlest and most honourable sense it would have been thought by some highly improbable that Clarissa should have been able to shew such a command of her passions as makes so distinguishing a part of her Character had she been as violently in Love as certain warm and fierce spirits would have had her to be A few Observations are thrown in by way of Note in the present Edition at proper places to obviate this Objection or rather to bespeak the  Attention  of hasty Readers to what lies obviously before them For thus the Heroine anticipates this very Objection expostulating with Miss Howe on her contemptuous treatment of Mr Hickman which far from being guilty of the same fault herself she did on all occasions and declares she would do whenever Miss Howe forgot herself altho' she had not a day to live  'O my dear says she that it had been my Lot as I was not permitted to live single to have met with a man by whom I  could  have acted generously and unreservedly  'Mr Lovelace it is now plain in order to have a pretence against me taxed my behaviour to him with stiffness and distance You at one time thought me guilty of some degree of Prudery Difficult situations should be allowed for which often make seeming occasions for censure unavoidable I deserved not blame from  him  who made mine difficult And if I had had any other man to deal with than Mr Lovelace or had he had but half the merit which Mr Hickman has you my dear should have found that my Doctrine on this subject should have governed my Practice'  See this whole Letter  Vol VII p  see also Mr Lovelace's Letter N  o  cxi Vol VII p  seq  where just before his Death he entirely acquits her conduct on this head  It has been thought by some worthy and ingenious persons that if Lovelace had been drawn an  Infidel  or  Scoffer  his Character according to the Taste of the present worse than Sceptical Age would have been more natural It is however too well known that there are very many persons of his Cast whose actions discredit their belief And are not the very Devils in Scripture said to  believe  and  tremble  But the Reader must have observed that great and it is hoped good Use has been made throughout the Work by drawing Lovelace an Infidel only in  Practice  and this as well in the arguments of his friend Belford as in his own frequent Remorses when touched with temporary Compunction and in his last Scenes which could not have been made had either of them been painted as  sentimental  Unbelievers Not to say that Clarissa whose great Objection to Mr Wyerley was that he was a Scoffer must have been inexcuseable had she known Lovelace to be so and had given the least attention to his Addresses On the contrary thus she comforts herself when she thinks she  must be his  'This one consolation however remains He is not an Infidel an Unbeliever Had he been an Infidel there would have been no room at all for hope of him but priding himself as he does in his fertile invention he would have been utterly abandoned irreclaimable and a Savage  See Vol IV p  '  And it must be observed that Scoffers are too witty in their own opinion in other words value themselves too much upon their profligacy to aim at concealing it  Besides had Lovelace added ribbald jests upon Religion to his other liberties the freedoms which would then have passed between him and his friend must have been of a nature truly infernal And this farther hint was meant to be given by way of inference that the man who allowed himself in those liberties either of speech or action which Lovelace thought shameful was so far a worse man than Lovelace For this reason is he everywhere made to treat jests on sacred things and subjects even down to the Mythology of the Pagans among Pagans as undoubted marks of the illbreeding of the jesters obscene images and talk as liberties too shameful for even Rakes to allow themselves in and injustice to creditors and in matters of  Meum  and  Tuum  as what it was beneath him to be guilty of  Some have objected to the meekness to the tameness as they will have it to be of the character of Mr Hickman And yet Lovelace owns that he rose upon him with great spirit in the interview between them once when he thought a reflection was but implied on  Miss Howe  See Vol VI p  and another time when he imagined  himself  treated contemptuously  See Vol VI p  Miss Howe it must be owned tho' not to the credit of her own character treats him ludicrously on several occasions But so she does her Mother And perhaps a Lady of her lively turn would have treated as  whimsically any man but a Lovelace Mr Belford speaks of him with honour and respect  Vol VI p  So does Colonel Morden  Vol VII p  And so does Clarissa on every occasion And all that Miss Howe herself says of him tends more to his reputation than discredit  Vol II p and Vol III p  as Clarissa indeed tells her  See Vol II p    And as to Lovelace's treatment of him the Reader must have observed that it was his way to treat every man with contempt partly by way of selfexaltation and partly to gratify the natural gaiety of his disposition He says himself to Belford  Vol VI p    'Thou knowest I love him not Jack and whom we love not we cannot allow a merit to perhaps not the merit they should be granted'  'Modest and diffident men' writes Belford to Lovelace in praise of Mr Hickman  'wear not soon off those little precisenesses which the confident if ever they had them presently get over'  But as Miss Howe treats her Mother as freely as she does her Lover so does Mr Lovelace take still greater liberties with Mr Belford than he does with Mr Hickman with respect to his person air and address as Mr Belford himself hints to Mr Hickman  Vol VII p  And yet he is not so readily believed to the discredit of Mr Belford by the Ladies in general as he is when he disparages Mr Hickman Whence can this partiality arise  Mr Belford had been a Rake But was in a way of reformation  Mr Hickman had always been a good man  And Lovelace  confidently says  That the women love a man whose regard for them is founded in the knowlege of them  See Vol V p    Nevertheless it must be owned that it was not proposed to draw Mr Hickman as the man of whom the Ladies in general were likely to be very fond Had it been so  Goodness of heart  and  Gentleness of manners great Assiduity  and  inviolable  and  modest  Love would not of themselves have been supposed sufficient recommendations He would not have been allowed the least share of  preciseness  or  formality  altho' those defects might have been imputed to his reverence for the object of his passion But in his character it was designed to shew that the same man could not be everything and to intimate to Ladies that in chusing companions for life they should rather prefer the honest heart of a Hickman which would be all their own than to risque the chance of sharing perhaps with scores and some of those probably the most profligate of the Sex the volatile mischievous one of a Lovelace In short that they should chuse if they wished for durable happiness for rectitude of mind and not for speciousness of person or address Nor make a jest of a good man in favour of a bad one who would make a jest of them and of their whole Sex  Two Letters however by way of accommodation are inserted in this edition which perhaps will give Mr Hickman's character some heightening with such Ladies as love spirit in a man and had rather suffer by it than not meet with it  Women born to be controul'd  Stoop to the Forward and the Bold  Says WallerAnd Lovelace too  Some have wished that the Story had been told in the usual narrative way of telling Stories designed to amuse and divert and not in Letters written by the respective persons whose history is given in them The Author thinks he ought not to prescribe to the taste of others but imagined himself at liberty to follow his own He perhaps mistrusted his talents for the narrative  kind of writing He had the good fortune to succeed in the Epistolary way once before A Story in which so many persons were concerned either principally or collaterally and of characters and dispositions so various carried on with tolerable connexion and perspicuity in a series of Letters from different persons without the aid of digressions and episodes foreign to the principal end and design he thought had  novelty  to be pleaded for it And that in the present age he supposed would not be a slight recommendation  But besides what has been said above and in the  Preface  on this head the following opinion of an ingenious and candid Foreigner on this manner of writing may not be improperly inserted here  'The method which the Author has pursued in the History of Clarissa is the same as in the Life of Pamela Both are related in familiar Letters by the parties themselves at the very time in which the events happened And this method has given the author great advantages which he could not have drawn from any other species of narration The minute particulars of events the sentiments and conversation of the parties are upon this plan exhibited with all the warmth and spirit that the passion supposed to be predominant at the very time could produce and with all the distinguishing characteristics which memory can supply in a History of recent transactions  'Romances in general and Marivaux's amongst others are wholly improbable because they suppose the History to be written after the series of events is closed by the catastrophe A circumstance which implies a strength of memory beyond all example and probability in the persons concerned enabling them at the distance of several years to relate all the particulars of a transient conversation Or rather it implies a yet more improbable confidence and familiarity between all these persons and the author  'There is however one difficulty attending the Epistolary method for it is necessary that all the characters should have an uncommon taste for this kind of conversation and that they should suffer no event nor even a remarkable conversation to pass without immediately committing it to writing But for the preservation of the Letters  once written  the author has provided with great judgment so as to render this circumstance highly probable  This quotation is translated from a CRITIQUE on the HISTORY of CLARISSA written in French and published at Amsterdam The whole C  itique is rendered into English and inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine of June and August The author has done great honour in it to the History of Clarissa and as there are Remarks published with it answering several objections made to different passages by that candid Foreigner the Reader is referred to the aforesaid Magazines for both  '  It is presumed that what this gentleman says of the difficulties attending a Story thus given in the Epistolary manner of writing will not be found to reach the History before us It is very well accounted for in it how the two principal Female characters come to take so great a delight in writing Their subjects are not merely subjects of amusement but greatly interesting to both Yet many Ladies there are who now laudably correspond when at distance from each other on occasions that far less affect their mutual welfare and friendships than those treated of by these Ladies The two principal gentlemen had motives of gaiety and vainglory for their inducements It will generally be found that persons who have talents for familiar writeing as these correspondents are presumed to have will not forbear amusing themselves with their pens on less arduous occasions than what offer to these These FOUR whose Stories have a connexion with each other out of a great number of characters which are introduced in this History are only eminent in the Epistolary way The rest appear but as occasional writers and as drawn in rather by necessity than  choice from the different relations in which they stand with the four principal persons  Vol  vii  p    l    after  the principal characters  insert  Some there are and Ladies too who have supposed that the excellencies of the Heroine are carried to an improbable and even to an impracticable height in this History But the education of Clarissa from  early childhood  ought to be considered as one of her very great advantages as indeed the foundation of  all  her excellencies And it is hoped for the sake of the doctrine designed to be inculcated by it that it will  She had a pious a wellre'd a not meanlydescended woman for her Nurse who with her milk as Mrs Harlowe says  See Vol IV p  gave her that nurture which no other Nurse could give her She was very early happy in the conversationvisits of her learned and worthy Dr Lewen and in her correspondencies not with him only but with other Divines mentioned in her last Will Her Mother was upon the whole a good woman who did credit to her birth and her fortune and  both  delighted in her for those improvements and attainments which gave her  and them in her  a distinction that caused it to be said that when she was out of the family it was considered but as a common family  See Vol VII p See also her Mother's praises of her to Mrs Norton Vol I p  She was moreover a Country Lady and as we have seen in Miss Howe's character of her  See Vol VII p  took great delight in rural and houshold employments tho' qualified to adorn the brightest circle  It must be confessed that we are not to look for  Clarissa's  among the  constant frequenters  of Ranelagh and Vauxhall nor among those who may be called  Daughters of the Cardtable  If we do the character  of our Heroine may then indeed be justly thought not only improbable but unattainable But we have neither room in this place nor inclination to pursue a subject so invidious We quit it therefore after we have  repeated  that we  know  there are  some  and we  hope  there are  many  in the British dominions or they are hardly anywhere in the European world who as far as  occasion  has called upon them to exert the like  humble  and  modest  yet  steady  and  useful  virtues have reached the perfections of a Clarissa  Having thus briefly taken notice of the most material objections that have been made to different parts of this History it is hoped we may be allowed to add That had we thought ourselves at liberty to give copies of some of the many Letters that have been written on the other side of the question that is to say in approbation of the Catastrophe and of the general Conduct and Execution of the work by some of the most eminent judges of composition in every branch of Literature most of what has been written in this Postscript might have been spared  But as the principal objection with many has lain against the length of the piece we shall add to what we have said above on that subject in the words of one of those eminent writers  'That  If  in the History before us  c  '  TO THE

HEADS  Adversity Affliction Calamity Misfortune  _GREAT allowance ought to be made for the warmth of a spirit embitter'd by undeserved disgraces  People in Misfortune are apt to construe even unavoidable accidents into sligh  s or neglects  Adversity is the state of trial of every good quality  People in Adversity should endeavour to preserve laudable customs that so if sunshine return they may not be losers by their trials  When Calamities befal us we ought to look into ourselves and  f  ar    Misfortunes are often sent to reduce us to a better reliance than that we have been accustomed to fix upon  No one is out of the reach of Misfortune No one therefore should glory in his prosperity  Be a person's Provocations ever so great her Calamities ever so heavy she should always remember that she is God's creature and not her own  Persons in Calamity when they wish for death should be sure that they wish for it from proper motives Worldly Disappointments will not of themselves warrant such wishes  Adversity will call forth graces in a noble mind which could not have been brought to light in prosperous fortune  People in Affliction or Distress cannot be hated by generous minds  People who thro' Calamity are careless of their health will not perhaps be able to escape death when they would wish to do so  In the school of Affliction we are taught to know ourselves to compassionate and bear with one another and to look up to a better state  The unhappy never want enemies  The person who makes a proper use of Calamity may be said to be in the direct road to glory  Persons who labour under  real  Evils will not puzzle themselves with  conjectural  ones  Calamity is the test of integrity  Distress makes the humbled heart diffident  Calamity calls out the fortitude that distinguishes a spirit truly noble  Certainty in a deep Distress is more eligible than suspense    See  Consolation  Advice and Cautions to Women  EVery one's eyes are upon the conduct the visits the visitors of a young Lady made early independent  Encroaching and designing men make an artillery of a woman's hopes and fears and play it upon her at their pleasure  Artful men frequently endeavour to entangle thoughtless women by bold supposals and offers and if not checked to reckon upon silence as concession  Women should be cautious how they give up their own Sex in conversation with the other in articles that relate to delicacy  Women however prudent and reserved should be careful that they do not give the man they intend to encourage reason to think that they balance on other competitions  Men who want to get a woman into their power seldom scruple the means  A woman who lends an ear to a Seducer may by  gentle  words be  insensibly  drawn in to the perpetration of the most  violent  acts  When women once enter themselves as Lovers there is hardly any receding  The man can have no good design who affects to a meekspirited woman an anger which is evidently manageable  A daughter ought to look upon a man who would tempt her to go off with him clandestinely as the vilest and most selfish of seducers  The woman who will correspond with a known Libertine indirectly defies him to do his worst  A woman who is above flattery and despises all praise but that which flows from the approbation of her own heart is  morally speaking  out of the reach of seduction  Women ought to be careful not to give cause to the man they love to think lightly of them for favours granted even to himself which may be supposed to spring from natural weakness  Women ought not to think gentleness of heart despicable in a man  That man's natural disposition is to be suspected whose politeness is not regular nor constant nor wrought into habit but appears only in fits starts and sailles  An acknowleged Love sanctifies every little freedom and little freedoms beget great ones  To give a woman an high opinion of her own sagacity is the measure that a designing man often takes to bring her to his will  I love when I dig a pit  says Lovelace  to have my prey tumble in with secure feet and open eyes for then a man can look down upon her with an Oho charmer how came you there  A woman in courtship for her own sake should so behave to the man she intends to marry as to shew the world that she thinks him worthy of respect  Libertines consider all those of the Sex over whom they obtain a power as fair prize  There seldom can be  peculiarity  in the Love of a rakish heart  If a woman be not angry at indecent pictures or verses shewn her by a Libertine but smiles at them she may blame herself if she suffer from his afterattempts  Even innocent freedoms are not to be allowed to a Libertine  To be punished by the consequences of our own choice what a moral  insultingly says Lovelace  lies there  A judgment may be generally formed of the reading part of the Sex by their books  The man who complains of the distance a Lady keeps him at wants to come  too near    One concession to a man is but a prelude to another  The confidence which a woman places in a man for his respectful behaviour to her ought to be withdrawn the moment that she sees in him an abatement of that reverence or respect which b  gat her confidence  A man who means honourably will not be fond of treading in crooked paths  How vain a thing is it for a woman who has put herself into the power of a man to say what the  will  or will  not  do  How can a woman who treating  herself  unpolitely gives a man an opportunity to run away with her expect him to treat her politely  The man who makes a flagrant tho' unsuccessful attempt and is forgiven or expostulated with meets with encouragement to renew it at an opportunity which he may think more favourable  Women of penetration falling  accidentally  into company with a Libertine and his associates will make them reflectingglasses to one another for her own service  One devious step at first setting out frequently leads a person into a wilderness of doubt and error  The man who is backward in urging a Lady to give him her hand at the Altar ought not to press her to favour him with it at public entertainments  Libertines in order the better to carry on their designs upon the unwary of the Female Sex  particularly against those who are prudish  frequently make pretences to  Platonic Love    If a woman suffers her Lover to see she is loth to disoblige him let her beware of an encroacher  The Libertine who by his specious behaviour has laid asleep a woman's suspicion and caution is in the way to complete all his views  If a woman will keep company with a man who has reason to think himself suspected by her  I am sure says Lovelace  it is a very hopeful sign  Women are apt to allow too much to a kneeling Lover  Nine parts in ten of women who fall  says Lovelace  owe their disgrace to their own vanity or levity or want of circumspection and proper reserve  Libertines  equally tyrannical and suspicious  expect that a wife should have no will no eyes no love no hate but at their direction  Travelling together gives opportunities of familiarity betwe  n the Sexes  says Lovelace Women therefore should be choice of the company they travel with  Women should be early taught to think highly of their Sex for pride  as Lov  lace says  is an excellent substitute for virtue  A woman of the brightest talents who throws herself into the power of a Libertine brings into question those talents as well as her discretion not only with himself but with his lewd companions to whom in secret triumph he will be proud to shew his prize  A modest woman fallen into gross company should avow her correctives by her eye and not affect ignorance of meanings too obvious to be concealed  A woman who has put herself into the power of a designing man must be satisfied with very poor excuses and pretences for delay of marriage  Want of power is the only bound that a libertine puts to his views upon any of the Sex  A fallen woman is the more inexcuseable as from the cradle the Sex is warned against the delusions of men  Men presume greatly on the liberties taken and laughed off in Romping  A Lady conscious of dignity of person should mingle with it a sweetness of manners to make herself beloved as well as respected by all who approach her  A man who insults the modesty of a woman as good as tells her that he has seen something in her conduct that warranted his presumption  A man who has offered the last indignity to a woman yet expects forgiveness from her must think  her  as weak as  be  is wicked  The woman who behaves with disrespect either to her accepted Lover or to her Husband gives every vain man hope of standing well with her  Clarissa apprehends that Lovelace might have ground to doubt her conduct from having been able to prevail upon her to correspond with him against paternal prohibition and the light of her own judgment  The nicest circumstances cannot be too nice to be attended to by women who are obliged either to converse or correspond with free livers  A woman who when attempted descends to  expostulation  lets the offender know that she intends to forgive him  A man whatever are his professions always thinks the  worse  of a woman who forgives him for making an attempt on her virtue  A man who offers indecencies to a woman depends for secrecy and forgiveness upon his own confidence and her bashfulness  The woman who takes any indirect steps in favour of a libertine if she escape  present  illtreatment from him intitles herself when his Wife to his future jealousy and censure  She who puts herself out of a natural protection is not to expert miracles in her favour  The woman who hopes to reclaim a Libertine  may  have reason to compare herself to one who attempting to save a drowning wretch is drawn in after him and perishes with him  Men take great advantages of even women of character who  can bear their free talk and boasts of Libertinism without resentment  Chastity like piety is an uniform grace If in look if in speech a girl give way to undue levity depend upon it  says Lovelace  the devil has already got one of his cloven seet in her heart  That woman must be indeed unhappy whose conduct has laid her under obligations to a man's silence  A bold man's effrontery in company of women must be owing to his low opinion of them and his high one of himself  A  good  woman who vows duty to a wicked man knowing him to be such puts to hazard her eternal happiness  How dreadfully sunk is the woman who supplicates for marriage to a man who has robbed her of her honour and who can be thankful to him for doing her such poor justice  How must such a one appear before  his  friends and  her own  divested of that noble confidence which arises from a mind unconscious of deserving reproach  How does she subject herself to the violator's upbraidings and to his insults of generosity and pity exerted in her favour  It must cut to the heart a thoughtful Mother whose Husband continues in his profligate courses to look round upon her Children with the reflection that she has given them a Father destin'd without a miracle to perdition  It would be as unpardonable in a Lady  says Lovelace in the true Libertine spirit  to break her word with me as it would be strange if I kept mine to her In Lovecases I mean for as to the rest I am an honest moral man  If a woman is conscious of having shewn weakness to a man wh  has insulted her modesty she may then come to a composition with him and forgive him  I never knew a man  says Miss Howe  who deserved to be thought well of for his morals who had a slight opinion of our Sex in general  If a woman consents to go off with a man and he prove ever so great a villain to her she must take into her own bosom  the whole reproach and  a share of his guilty baseness  Offences against women and those of the most heinous nature constitute and denominate the  Man of Gallantry    The pen next to the needle of all employments whether for improvement or amusement is the most proper and best adapted to the genius of women  The woman who neglects the  useful  and the  elegant  which distinguishes her own Sex for the sake of obtaining the learning which is supposed peculiar to men incurs more contempt by what she foregoes than she gains credit by what she acquires  The practical knowlege of the domestic duties is the principal glory of a woman  The woman who aims at more than a knowlege of the beauties and graces of her mother tongue too often endangers her family usefulness  Young Ladies should endeavour to make up for their defects in one part of their education by their excellence in another    See the articles  Courtship Duty Husband and Wife Libertine Marriage Parents and Children Reflections on Women Vows  Air and Manner Address  AIR and Manner are often more expressive than words  That Address in a man for which he is often most valued by a woman is generally owing to his assurance  A concession should be made with a grace or not at all  What a  mere  personal advantage is a plausible Address without morals  A specious address frequently abates even a  justly  conceiv'd displeasure  There is a Manner in speaking that may be liable to exception when the words without that Manner will bear none  Anger Displeasure  ANger and disgust alter the property at least the appearance of things  People hardly ever do anything in Anger of which they do not repent  A person of hard features should not allow himself to be very angry  We should not be angry at a person's  not  doing that for us which he has a right either to do or to let alone  Faulty people should rather be sorry for the occasion they have given for Anger than resent it  Nothing can be lovely in a man's eye with which he is displeased  An angry or offended man will not allow to the person with whom he is displeased the merit which is his due  Angry people should never write while their passion holds  Anger unpolishes the most polite  The Displeasure of friends is to be borne even by an innocent person when it unquestionably proceeds from love  An innocent person may be thankful for that Displeasure in her friend which gives her an opportunity of justifying herself  But then it is ungenerous in a displeased friend not to acknowlege and ask excuse for the mistake which caused the Displeasure the moment he or she is convinced  People of little understanding are most apt to be angry when their sense is called into question  See  Passion  Apprehensions Fear  THE tender mind drawn in to pursue an irregular adventure will be rendy to start at every unexpected appearance  The most apprehensive beginnings often make the happiest conclusions  The certainty even of what we fear is often more tolerable than the suspense  The very event of which we are most apprehensive is sometimes that which we ought to wish for  Threateners where they have an opportunity to put in force their threats are seldom to be feared  It is better in a critical and uncertain situation to apprehend without cause than to subject one's self to surprize for want of forethought  Evils are often greater in  Apprehension  than in  reality    An earnest disavowal of Fear often proceeds from Fear  Few men fear those whom they do not value  Beauty Figure  COmeliness not having so much to lose as Beauty has will hold when Beauty will evaporate or fly off  Personal advantages are oftener snares than benefits  Tho' Beauty is generally the creature of fancy yet are there some who will be Beauties in every eye  A good Figure or Person in man or woman gives credit at first sight to the choice of either  Men m  re especially ought to value themselves rather for their intellectual than personal qualifications  The pretty fool in all she says in all she does will please we know not why  Who would grudge the pretty fool her day  When her butterfly flutters are over she will feel in the general contempt she will meet with the just effects of having neglected to cultivate her better faculties  While the discreet matron who from youth has maintained her character will find solid veneration take place of airy admiration and more than supply the want of the latter  A lovely woman whether angry or pleased will appear lovely  That cruel distemper which often makes the greatest ravages in the finest faces is not always to be thought an evil  Goodness and generosity give grace and lustre to Beauty  Blushes Blushing  A Distinction is to be made between the confusion which guilt will be attended with and the noble consciousness that overspreads the face of a fine spirit on its being thought capable of an imputed evil  Silence and Blushes are now no graces  says Lovelace  with our fine Ladies  Harden'd by frequent public appearances our modern fine Ladies would be as much ashamed as men to be found guilty of blushing  Lovel  The woman who at a gross hint puts her fan before her face seems to be conscious that her Blush is not quite ready  Lovel      See  Modesty  Censure Character  THE world illnatur'd as it is said to be is generally more just in giving Characters speaking by what it  feels  than is usually imagined  Those who complain most of the Censoriousness of the world perhaps ought to look  inward  for the occasion oftener than they do  A wrong step taken by a woman who aims to excel subjects her to more severe censures from the world whose envy she has excited than that world would cast on a less perfect character  Characters very good or extremely bad are seldom justly given  We should be particularly careful to keep clear of the faults we censure  Hasty  Censurers subject themselves to the charge of variableness in judgment  We should always make allowances for the Characters whether bad or good that are given us by interested persons  Many of those who have escaped censure have not merited applause  Where reputation is concerned we should not be in haste to censure  We should never judge peremptorily on first appearances  Good people  or rather these who affect to be thought good says Lovelace  are generally so uncharitable that I should not chuse to be good were the consequence to be that I must think hardly of everybody else  Every man and woman  says Lovelace  is apt to judge of others by what they know of themselves  A man who proves base to the confidence a woman places in him justifies the harshest censures of such of his enemies as would have persuaded her to reject him  Character runs away with and byasses all mankind  In the very Courts of Justice character acquits and condemns as often as fact and sometimes in spite of fact  Lovel  It is not always just to censure according to events  Difficult situations make seeming occasions for censure unavoidable  Censoriousness and narrowness generally prevail with those who affect to be thought more pious than their neighbours  Very few Ladies would be condemned or even accused in the circles of Ladies were they present  Human depravity it is feared will oftener justify those who judge harshly than those who judge favourably yet will not good people part with their charity  Nevertheless it is right to make that charity consist with caution and prudence  Charity Beneficence Benevolence  BEnevolent spirits are sufficiently happy in the noble consciousness that attends their Benevolence  'Tis a generous pleasure in a Landlord to love to see all his tenants look fat sleck and contented  That spirit ought not to have the credit of being called bountiful that reserves not to itself the power of being just  In cases where great good is wished to be done it is grievous to have the will without having the power  True Generosity is Greatness of soul it incites us to do more by a fellowcreature than can be strictly required of us  Innocent and benevolent spirits are sure to be considered as aliens and to be made to suffer by the genuine sons and daughters of earth  A beneficent person diverted from her course by calamity will resume it the moment she can and go on doing good to all about her as before  The power of conferring benefits is a godlike power  A truly generous and beneficent person will in a sudden distress find out the unhappy before the sighing heart is overwhelmed by it  A prudent person will suit her Charities to the person's usual way of life  Persons bless'd with a  will  should be doubly careful to preserve to themselves the  power  of doing good  The honest industrious labouring poor whom sickness lameness or unforeseen accidents have reduced ought to be the principal objects of our Charity  Small helps will set forward the sober and industrious poor An ocean of wealth will not be sufficient for the idle and proffigate  It is not Charity to relieve the dissolute if what is given to them deprive the worthy poor of such assistance as would set the wheels of their industry going  That Charity which provides for the  morals  as well as for the bodily wants of the poor gives a double benefit to the public as it adds to the number of the hopeful what it takes from that of the profligate  Can there be in the eyes of that God who requires nothing so much from us as acts of beneficence to one another a Charity more worthy than that of providing for the souls as well as the bodies of our fellowcreatures  See  Generosity  Church Clergy  THE Church is a good place to begin a reconciliation in if people mean anything by their prayers  says Lovelace    Who that has views either worldly or cruel can go to Church and expect a blessing  It is a juster satire upon human nature than upon the Cloth if we suppose that those who have the  best  opportunities of being good are less perfect than others  Professional  as well as  national  reflections are to be avoided  The Church ought to be the only marketplace for women and domestic excellence their capital recommendation  A good Clergyman must love and venerate the Gospel he teaches and prefer it to all other learning  The young Clergyman who throws about to a Christian audience scraps of Latin and Greek from the Pagan Classics shews something wrong either in his heart or head or in both  A general contempt of the Clergy  even Lovelace confesses  is a certain sign of a man of free principles    See  Conscience Death Religion  Comedies Tragedies Music Dancing  LIbertines afraid to trust themselves with serious and solemn reflections run to Comedies in order to laugh away compunction and to find examples of men as immoral as themselves  Very few of our Comic Performances give good examples  Mr  Lovelace  Mrs  Sinclair Sally Martin Polly Horton  Miss  Partington  love not Tragedies They have hearts  too feeling  There is enough in the world  say they  to make the heart sad without carrying grief into our diversions and making the distresses of others our own  Libertines love not any Tragedies but those in which they themselves act the parts of tyrants and executioners  The woes of others well represented will unlock and open a tender heart  Lovel  The female heart expands and forgets its forms when its attention is carried out of itself at an  agreeable  or affecting Entertainment  Lovel  Women therefore should be cautious of the company they go with to public Entertainments  Music and other maidenly amusements are too generally given up by women when married  Music  says Lovelace  is an amusement that may be necessary to keep a young woman out of more active mischief  Wine is an opiate in degree How many women  says Lovelace  have been taken at advantage by wine and intoxicating viands  Dancing is a diversion that women love but they ought to be wary of their company  Women to women when warm'd by Dancing Music  c  are great darers and provokers  Persons who sing and play tolerably yet plead inability wish not always to be believed  Condescension  COndescension that proceeds from force or even from policy may be often discovered to be forced by observing the eyes and lips  Condescension is not meanness iv On the contrary the very word implies dignity  There is a glory in yielding of which a violent spirit can hardly judge  By Gentleness and Condescension a requester leaves favourable impressions upon an angry person which on cooler reflection may bring the benefit denied at the time  That Condescension which has neither pride nor insult in it gives a grace to the person as well as to the action which demonstrates it  Conscience Consciousness  PErsons of Conscience will be afraid to begin the world unjustly  A woman who by surprize or otherwise is brought to swerve loses all that noble selfconfidence which otherwise would have given her a visible superiority over her tempter  How uneasy are our reflections upon every doubtful occurrence when we know we have been prevail'd upon to do a wrong thing  It is a satisfaction to a worthy mind to have borne its testimony against the vile actions of a bad one  Selfcomplacency is  necessary  to carry a woman thro' this life with tolerable satisfaction to herself  The look of every person will be construed as a reproach by one who is conscious of having capitally erred  As to the world and its censures  says Clarissa  however desirous I always was of a fair same I never thought it right to give more than a second place to the world's opinion  A pure intention void of all undutiful resentments is what must be my consolation  says Clarissa  whatever others may think of the measures I have taken when they come to be known  Consolation  THose who have not deserved illusage have reason to be the easier under it  Who would not with patience sustain even a great evil could she persuade herself that it might most probably be dispensed in order to prevent a still  greater  How much lighter on reflection will the same evils sit on the heart of one who has not brought them upon herself than upon one who has  There is one common point in which all shall meet err widely as they may  Patience and perseverance overcome the greatest difficulties  If a person in calamity can consider herself as called upon to give an example of patience and resignation she will find her mind greatly invigorated  All nature and everything in it has its bright and gloomy side We should not always be thinking of the worst  My mind  says Clarissa to Lovelace and Tomlinson  is prepared for adversity That I have not deserved the evils I have met with is my Consolation  There must be a world after this to do justice to injured innocence and to punish barbarous perfidy  We often look back with pleasure on the heaviest griefs when the cause of them is removed  No one ought to think the worse of herself for having suffered what she could not avoid  Temporary evils may be borne with because they are  but  temporary  None are made to suffer beyond what they  can  bear and therefore  ought  to bear  We know not the methods of Providence nor what wise ends it may have to serve in its seemingly severe dispensations  A patient and innocent sufferer will look to a world beyond this for its reward  Many happy days may persons greatly unhappy live to see if they will not heighten unavoidable accidents into guilty despondency  We should in an heavy evil comfort  ourselves  as we would in the like circumstances comfort  others    This world is designed but for a transitory state of probation A good person considering herself as travelling thro' it to a better will put up with all the hardships of the journey in hopes of an ample reward at the end of it  Had I  says Clarissa drawing near her end  escaped the evils I labour under I might have been taken in the midst of some gay promising hope when my heart had beat high with desire of life and when the vanity of this earth had taken hold of me  What happiness on reflection does that person enjoy who has not acted unworthy of herself in the time of trial and temptation  All the  troubles  of this world as well as its joys are but of short duration  Things the most grievous to human nature at the time often in the event prove the happiest for us  We remember those we have  long  lost with more pleasure than pain  Solemn impressions that seem to  weaken  the mind may by proper reflection be made to  strengthen  it  Where there is a reliance made on Providence it seldom fails to raise up a new friend for every old one that falls off  There is often a  necessity  for a considerate person's being unhappy in order to be happy  Good motions wrought into habits will yield pleasure at a time when nothing else can  Persons enured to afflictions and who have lived in constant hope of a better life and have no flagrant vices to reproach themselves with are the fittest comforters of friends in distress  When a man has not great good to comfort himself with it is right  says Lovelace  to make the best of the  little  that may offer  There never was any discomfort happen'd to mortal man but some little ray of Consolation would dart in if the wretch was not so  much  a wretch as to  draw  instead of  undraw  the curtain to keep it out    See  Adversity Conscience Death Grief Human Life Religion  Controul Authority  NO extraordinary qualifications are to be expected from a man who never as a child was subject to Controul  Young Ladies on whom parental Controul is known to fit heavily give a man of intrigue room to think that they want to he parents themselves  Lovel  A generous mind will then only be jealous of Controul when it imagines its laudable friendships or its generosity are likely to be wounded by it  A man by seeming afraid of Controul often subjects himself to it  People awed and controuled tho' but by their own consciousness of inferiority will find fault right or wrong with those of whose rectitude of mind and manners their own culpable hearts give them to be afraid    See  Duty Parents and Children  Covetousness Avarice  A Covetous man acts as if he thought the world made for himself only  Covetous people may bear with every one's ill word since they are so solicitous to keep what they prefer to every one's good word  The difference between obtaining a same for generosity and incurring the censure of being a miser will not prudently managed cost fifty pounds a year  Amiser's heir may at a small expence obtain the reputation of generosity  When was an ambitious or covetous mind satisfied with acquisition  A prodigal man generally does more injustice than a covetous one  What man or woman who is covetous of wealth or of power desires either for the sake of making a right use of it  Time is the only thing of which we can be allowably covetous since we live but once in this world and when gone are gone from it for ever  See  Self  Courtship  REverence to a woman in  Courtship  is the less to be dispensed with as generally there is but little of it shewn  afterwards    A very ready consent often subjects a woman to contempt  If a man cannot make a woman in Courtship own herself  pleased  with him it is as  much  and oftentimes  more  to his purpose to make her  angry  with him  Lovel  That disgust must be sincere which is conceived on a first visit and confirmed in every after one  A woman who shews a very great dislike to the  Lover  whom afterward she is induced to  marry  had need to have a double share of prudence to behave unexceptionably to her  Husband    He who perseveres in his addresses to a woman whose aversion or dislike to him he has no reason to doubt wants the spirit that distinguishes a man  Very few people in Courtship see each other as they are  Our Courtshipdays are our best days Favour destroys Courtship distance encreases it  Miss Howe    A woman in Courtship has reason to resent those passions in her Lover which are predominant to that he pretends to have for her  One of the greatest indignities that can be cast on a woman in Courtship is for a man to be so profligate as to engage himself in lewd pursuits at the time he pretends his whole heart to be hers  A woman accustomed to be treated with obsequiousness will expect obsequiousness to the end of the Courtship chapter  says Miss Howe    The man who expresses high respect to a woman is entitled if not to  acceptance  to  civility    A wise man will not discourage that discretion in a  mistress  which will be his glory and security in a  wife    The woman who in Courtship treats haughtily or ill the man she intends to have gives room for the world to think either That she has a mean opinion of him and an high one of herself  Or That she has not generosity enough to use moderately the power which his great affection gives her  Such a woman gives reason to free livers to suppose and to presume upon it that the man to whom she intends to give her hand has no share in her heart  And if she shew that regard to him  after  marriage of which she shewed none  before  it will be construed as a compliment to the  Husband  made at the expence of the  Wife  's and even of the  Sex  's delicacy  Such a one will teach the world say  her  example to  despise  the man whom when her Husband she would wish it to  respect    To condescend with dignity to command with kindness and sweetness of manners are points to be aimed at by a wise woman in Courtship  She should let her Lover see that she has generosity to approve of and reward a wellmeant service  That she has a mind that lifts her above the little captious follies which some attribute to the Sex  That she resents not if ever she has reason to be displeased thro' pride or with petulance  That by insisting on little points she aims not to come at or to secure great ones perhaps not proper to be carried  Nor leaves room to suppose that she thinks she has so much cause to doubt her own merit as to make it needful to put her Lover upon disagreeable or arrogant trials  But lets reason be the principal guide of her actions  And then she will hardly ever fail of that respect which will  make her judgment  after  marriage consulted sometimes with a preference to a man's own at other times as a delightful confi  mation of his  When  judgment  is at a loss to determine the choice of a Lady who has several Lovers  fancy  may the more allowably predominate  Women cannot put the question to a Lover Whether he mean honourably or not in his address without affronting their own virtue and personal graces  They should therefore never admit of the address of a Libertine  The woman who in Courtship uses ill the man she intends to have reflects not on the obligations her pride is laying her under to him for his  patience  with her    See  Advice to Women Husband and Wife Libertine Love Marriage Parents and Children Reflections on Women Vows  Credulity  WOmen are sometimes drawn in to believe against

probably exert itself on their fellowcreatures when at years of maturity  Let the parents of such a child expect a Lovelace  When we reflect upon the cruelties daily practised upon such of the animal creation as are given us for food or which we ensnare for our diversion we shall be obliged to own  says even Lovelace  that there is more of the savage in human nature than we are aware of  Infinite

by the sword of injured friendship is the most dreadful of all Deaths next to Suicide  Resignation in Death and reliance on the Divine mercies give great comfort to the friends of the dying  A good conscience only can support a person in a sensible and gradual Death  It is a choice comfort at the winding up of our short story  says Clarissa  to be able to say  "I have rather  suffered  injuries

young woman of Delicacy would be thought to have  inclinations  so violent that she could not conquer them or a  will  so stubborn that she would not at the entreaty and advice of her friends attempt the conquest  Punctilio is out of doors the moment a Daughter clandestinely quits her Father's house  How inexcuseable are those giddy creatures who in the same hour leap from a parent's window to an Husband's bed  Numberless are the reasons that might be given why a woman of the least Delicacy should never think of going off with a man  A woman who goes off with a man has no room either to practise Delicacy herself or to expect it from the man  A consent in some nice Lovecases were better taken for granted than asked for  Few very few men are there who have Delicacy enough to enter into those parts of the female character which are its glory and distinction  Overniceness may be underniceness  Men  need not  give indelicate hints to women on subjects that relate to themselves  Lovel  A man who is gross in a woman's company  adds he  ought to be knock'd down with a club  Delicate women make delicate women and also decent men  There are points so delicate that it is a degree of

Delicacy    See  Advice to Women Courtship Duty Libertine Love Marriage Men and Women  c  Despondency Despair  IF we despond there can be no hope of cure  To despond is to add sin to sin  When a

despair  says Belton  that God's  justice  cannot let his  mercy  operate for my comfort    See  Consolation  Deviation  TO condemn a Deviation and to follow it by as great a one what is it but to propagate a general corruption  The Deviation of a person of eminence is more inexcuseable than that of a common person  In unhappy situations it will be difficult even for worthy persons to avoid sometimes departing from the simple truth  How necessary is it then for such persons to be careful that they do not by their own inconsideration involve themselves in difficulties  Worthy persons if inadvertently drawn into a Deviation will endeavour instantly to recover their lost ground that they may not bring error into habit  A criminal Deviation in one friend is likely to cast a shade upon the other  To the pure every little Deviation  says Lovelace  seems offensive  One devious step at first setting out frequently leads a person into a wilderness of doubt and error  When we are betrayed into a capital Deviation lesser Deviations will hardly be avoidable  She who is too ready to excuse a wilful Deviation in another renders her own virtue suspectable  Jam Harl    See  Guilt Human Nature  Dignity Quality  UPon true Quality and hereditary Distinction if sense be not wanting honours and affluence sit easy  If we assume a Dignity and disgrace not by arrogance our assumption everybody will treat us with respect and deference  Hereditary Dignity conveys more disgrace than honour to descendents who have not merit to adorn it  Gentleman  is a title of distinction which a Prince may not deserve  The first Dignity ought to be accompanied with the first merit  Grandeur  says Lovelace  always makes a man's face shine in a woman's eye  People who are fenced in either by their Years or Quality should not  says Lovelace  take freedoms that a man of spirit ought to resent from others  True Dignity admits not of pride or arrogance  Some men have a native Dignity in their manner which will procure them more regard by a look than others can obtain by the most imperious commands  The man who is good by choice as well as by education has that  Quality  in himself  that true Dignity  which ennobles human nature and without which the most dignified by birth or rank are ignoble  Women who will not assume some little Dignity and exact respect from men will render themselves cheap and perhaps have their modesty and diffidence repaid with scorn and insult  Miss Howe      See  Advice to Women Courtship Delicacy Libertine  c  Double Entendre  IT is an odious thing in a man to look sly and leering at a woman whose modesty is invaded by another by indecent hints or Double Entendre  What a grossness is there in the mind of that man who thinks to reach a Lady's heart by wounding her ears  Wellbred men who think themselves in virtuous company will not allow in themselves such liberties of speech as tho' not free enough for open censure are capable of conveying impure images to the heart  Men who go out of their way to hint free things must either be guilty of absurdity meaning nothing or meaning something of rudeness  Obscenity is so shameful even

 All that hoops are good for  says Miss Howe  is to clean dirty shoes and to keep fellows at distance  The mind is often indicated by outward Dress  Homely persons the more they endeavour to adorn themselves the more they expose the defects they want to hide  If women  says Lovelace  would make themselves appear as elegant to an Husband as they were desirous to appear to him while a Lover the  Rake  which all women love would last longer in the  Husband  than it generally does  A woman who would preserve a Lover's respect to her person will be careful of her appearance before him when in dishabille  Full Dress creates dignity augments consciousness and keeps at distance an encroacher  An elegant woman in her earliest hour will for  her own  pleasure be as nice as others in full dress  Elegant Dress contributes greatly to keep passion alive  Dress gives great advantage to women who have naturally a genteel air and have been well educated  Persons who thro' misfortunes chuse not to dress should not however give up neatness  A Fop takes great pains to hang out a  sign  by his Dress of what he has in his  shop    A clumsy Beau seems to owe himself a double spite making his ungracefulness appear the more ungraceful by his tawdriness in Dress  Lovel  Singularity of Dress shews something wrong in the mind  Plain Dress for an ordinary man or woman implies at least modesty and procures kind quarter even from the censorious  The Fashion or Dress that becomes one person frequently misbecomes another  Nature and Ease should be the guides in Dress or Fashion  ibid    See  Advice to Women Delicacy Dignity  Duelling  A Man of honour cannot go to law for verbal abuses given by people entitled to wear swords  Duelling is so fashionable a part of brutal bravery that a good man is often at a loss so to behave as to avoid incurring either mortal guilt or general contempt  Those who throw contempt upon a good man for chusing rather to pass by a verbal injury than imbrue his hands in blood know not the measure of true magnanimity  'Tis much more noble to forgive and much more manly to despise than to resent an injury  A man of spirit should too much disdain the man who is capable of doing him wilfully a mean wrong to put his life upon equal value with his own  What an absurdity is it in a man to put it in the power of one who has done him a  small  injury to do him as it may happen and those who love him an irreparable one  What a flagrant partiality is it in those men who can  themselves  be guilty of crimes which they justly hold unpardonable in their nearest female relations  Yet cannot commit them without doing such injuries to other families as they think themselves obliged to resent unto death when offered to their own  An innocent man ought not to run an equal risk with a guilty one  He who will arrogate to himself the province of the Almighty who has declared  that vengeance is His  ought to tremble at what may be the consequence  May it not in case of the  offended  person's giving the challenge be suitable to the Divine justice to punish the  presumptuous innocent  by the hand of the  selfdefending guilty  reserving him for a future day of vengeance  Life is a short stage when longest If Heaven will afford a wicked man time for repentance who shall dare to deny it him  The conscience of the offender when it shall please God to strike it shall be sharper than an avenger's sword  Duelling is not only an usurpation of the Divine prerogative but it is an insult upon magistracy and good government  'Tis an impious act 'tis an attempt to take away a life that ought not to depend upon a private sword  An act the consequence of which is to hurry a soul all its sins upon its head into perdition endangering also that of the poor triumpher since neither intend to give to the other that opportunity for repentance which each presumes to hope for himself  Where shall the evil of Duelling stop Who shall avenge on the avenger  Who would not wish that the aggressor should be still the  guilty  aggressor  Often has the  more  guilty been the vanquisher of the  less  guilty    See  Guilt Libertine  Duty Obedience  A Good child will not seek to exculpate herself at the expence of the most revered characters  If we suffer by an act of Duty or even of generosity we have this comfort on reflection that the fault is in others not in ourselves  Altho' our parents or friends should not do everything for us that we may wish or expect it becomes us nevertheless to be thankful to them for the benefits they have actually conferred on us  A good child upon ill terms with her parents tho' hopeless of success should leave no means unattempted to reconcile herself to them were it but to acquit herself to herself  A sufferer may not be able to forbear complaining of the ill treatment she meets with from her parents but it may go  against her to have even the person to whom she complains take the same liberties with them  The want of reward is no warrant for us to dispense with our Duty  The merit of Obedience consists in giving up an inclination  In reciprocal Duties the failure on one side justifies not a failure on the other  Prudence and Duty will enable a person to overcome the greatest difficulties  Where is the praiseworthiness of Obedience if it be only paid in instances where we give up nothing  If a passion  can  be conquered it is a sacrifice a good child owes to indulgent parents especially if they would be unhappy if she made not such a sacrifice  No independency of fortune can free a child from her filial Duty  Nor ought any change of circumstances to alter her notions of Duty  A Duty exacted with too much rigour is often attended with fatal consequences  The Duty of a child to her parents may be said to be anterior to her very birth  What is the precise stature or age at which a good child may conclude herself absolved from her filial Duty  A good person cannot look with indifference on any part of a vow'd Duty  A worthy person will make it her prayer as well as her endeavour that whatever trials she may be called upon to undergo she may not behave unworthily in them and may come out amended by them  A Daughter who chearfully gives up an inclination to the judgment of her parents may be said to have laid them under obligation to her  Can a fugitive Daughter enjoy herself while her parents are in tears  Other peoples not performing their Duty is no excuse for the neglect of ours  says even Lovelace    The world is too apt to set itself in opposition to a general Duty  General Duties ought not to he weakened by our endeavouring to justify a single person if faulty however unhappily circumstanced  There is no merit in performing a Duty  A dutiful Daughter gives an earnest of making a dutiful and obliging Wife  Duty upon principle will oblige to an uniformity of Duty in every relation of life  Rigour makes it difficult for sliding virtue to recover itself    See  Parents and Children  Education  ENcouragement and approbation bring to light talents that otherwise would never have appeared  There is a docible season a learningtime in youth which suffered to elapse and no foundation laid seldom returns  Some genius's like some fruits ripen not till late  Industry and perseverance in study will do prodigious things  What an uphill labour must it be to a learner who has those first rudiments to master at twenty years of age which others are taught at ten  Parents ought to cultivate the minds of their Daughters and inspire them with early notions of reserve and distance to men  Lovel  It is not enough that a youth be put upon doing acts of beneficence he must be taught to do them from proper motives  A pious end and a crown of glory are generally the natural fruits of a virtuous Education  The person who aims at acquiring too many things will hardly excel in any  Improvement must attend upon those who are more ready to hear than to speak    See  Advice to Women Duty Parents and Children  Example  PErsons distinguished by their rank or their virtues are answerable to the public for their conduct in material points  Persons of prudence and distinguish'd talents seem to be sprinkled thro' the world to do credit by their example to religion and virtue  No one should plead the errors of another in justification of his own  Persons who are fond of being thought of as examples should look into themselves watch and  fear    Dearly do I love  says Lovelace speaking of Miss Rawlins  to engage with the Preceptgivers and Examplesetters  The Example at church of persons conspicuous for virtue rank and sense gives an high credit to religion    See  Religion Virtue  Expectation  THere is more joy in Expectation and preparation than in fruition  be the pursuit what it will    Mankind cheat themselves by their raised Expectations of pleasure in prospect  Very seldom is it that high Expectations are so much as tolerably answered  The joys of Expectation are the highest of all our joys  Eyes  A Weeping Eye indicates a gentle heart  Sparkling Eyes  says Lovelace  when the poetical tribe have said what they will of them are an infallible sign of a rogue or toom for a rogue in the heart  The Eye is the casement at which the heart generally looks out  Lovel  Many a woman who will not shew herself at the door has tipt the sly the intelligible wink from the window  Lovel    See  Tears  Faults Folly Failings Error  A Man who gives the world cause to have an ill opinion of him ought to take the consequence of his own Faults  Who ever was in Fault Self being judge  What an hero or heroine must that person be who can conquer a constitutional fault  It is not enough for a person convicted of a Fault to own it if he amend it not  An enemy wishes not a man to be without the Faults he upbraids him with  A woman who gives better advice than she takes doubles the weight of her own Faults  Faults which arise from generous attachments are not easily detected  No man has a right to be displeased at freedoms taken with him for Faults which he is not ashamed to confess  It ought to be our care that whatever Errors we fall into they should be the Faults of our judgment and not of our will  Great Faults and great Virtues are often found in the same persons  Repetition of Faults revives the remembrance of Faults forgiven  When we are drawn into an Error we should take care to make as few people as possible suffer by the consequence of it  One Crime is generally the parent of another  It is kind to endeavour to extenuate the Fault of one who is more ready to reproach than to excuse herself  Wicked men will often abuse people for the consequence of their own Faults  Worthy minds should not be more ready to fly from the rebuke than from the Fault  We may be mortified by a calamity brought upon ourselves but this rather for the calamity's than the Fault's sake  People are apt to make allowances for such Faults in others as they will not amend in themselves  Persons who will not be at the pains of correcting constitutional Faults or Failings frequently seek to gloss them over by some nominal virtues  See  Guilt  Favour  FAvours are ask'd by some with an air that calls for rejection  To exalt the person we favour above his merit is but to depreciate him  A worthy mind will not ask a Favour till it has considered whether it is fit to be granted  In our expectations of Favours we should divest ourselves of  self  so far as to leave to others the option they have a right to make  Awe reverence and apprehended prohibition make a Favour precious  Lovel  To request a Favour is one thing to challenge it as our due is another  A petitioner has no right to be angry at a repulse if he has not a right to demand what he sues for as a debt  The grace with which a Favour is conferred may be as acceptable as the Favour itself  Flattery Compliments  IF we have power to oblige our Flatterers will tell us anything sooner than what they know we dislike to hear  Complimental flourishes are the poison of female minds  Hyperbolic Compliments are elevated absurdities  A man who flatters a woman hopes either to find her a fool or to make her one  It is not always wrong to take the man at his word who pretending to depreciate himself lays out for a compliment  Undue compliments ought to be looked upon as affronts to the understanding of the person to whom they are addressed  Women by encouraging Flatterers teach men to be hypocrites yet at other times stigmatize them for deceivers  Lovel  Great men do evil and leave it to their Flatterers to find a reason for it afterwards  Officious persons are always at hand to flatter or sooth the passions of the affluent  Many persons endeavouring to avoid the imputation of Flattery or Hypocrisy run into rusticity or illmanners    See  Advice to Women  Fond Fondness  THE woman must expect to bear slights from the  husband  of whom she was too visibly fond as a  lover    Fondness spoils more wives than it makes grateful  Solmes    The fond mother ever makes an harden'd child  Coy maids make fond wives  says Mr Solmes    The Fondness of a wife to an husband whom in courtship she despised for mental imperfections must be imputed either to dissimulation or to very indelicate motives  We are apt to be fond of anybody that will side with us when we are oppressed or provoked  Fondness and Toying between a married pair before company  Lovelace  himself condemns not only as indiscreet but as indecent and scandalous  Single Ladies who shew too visible a Fondness for a man discharge him from all complaisance  Single Ladies should never be witnesses to those freedoms between fond husbands and wives tho' ever so much the wife's friends which they would not have offered to themselves  Lovel  Forgiveness Pardon  MAny a young offender against modesty and decency has been confirmed a libertine by a too easy forgiveness  An easy Forgiveness where a person  ought  to be forgiven will encrease the obligation with a mind not ungenerous  A negative Forgiveness is an ungracious one  The person who would exact a promise of Pardon tacitly acknowleges that he deserves it not  May those be forgiven  prays Clarissa in the height of her calamities  who hinder my Father from forgiving me and this shall be the harshest thing relating to them that falls from my pen  An accidental and unpremeditated error carries with it the strongest plea for Forgiveness  Tell Mr  Lovelace nobly says Clarissa  that I am endeavouring to bring my mind to such a frame as to be able to pity him and that I shall not think myself qualified for the state I am aspiring to if after a few struggles more I cannot  forgive  him too  Nothing can be more wounding than a generous Forgiveness  The easy Pardon perverse children meet with when they have done the most rash and undutiful thing they can do occasions many to follow their example  To be forgiven by injured Innocents is necessary  Lovelace think  to the divine Pardon  Men are less unforgiving than women  Lovel  Friendship  TRUE Friendship admits not of reserve  Friendship should never give a byass against judgment  How shall we expect to avoid the censure of our enemies if our Friends will not hold a lookingglass before us to let us see our imperfections in it  Friend should judge Friend as an indifferent person would be supposed to judge of him  It is natural for the person who has the misfortune of losing old Friends to be d  sirous of making new ones  Such a difference in temper and constitution in two young Ladies as exclud  s all imaginary rivalship may be the cement of a firm Friendship between them  The part of a true Friend is to sooth or conciliate rather than to stimulate or provoke the anguish of a complaining spirit ill at ease w  th her nearest relations  A Brother may not be a Friend but a Friend will always be a Brot  r  An ingenuous and worthy mind will say with  Clarissa    "Spare me not  because  I am your Friend but rather for that very reason spare me not"  No true Friend can ask to be relieved from a distress which would involve a Friend in as deep a one  But if with a small inconvenience to ourselves we could relieve our Friend from a great one I would not  says Miss Howe  admit the refuser into the outermost fold of my heart  To be displeased with a Friend for telling us our faults is putting ourselves into the inconvenient situation of royalty and out of the way of amendment  Veneration is hardly compatible with that sweet familiarity which is necessary to unite two persons in the bands of Friendship  The person who has been mi  led as obliged as well in prudence as in generosity and justice that her own error may not spread to caution a trulybeloved Friend not to fall into the like  Freely to give reproof and thankfully to receive it is an indispensable condition of true Friendship  An apology made for an honest and friendly freedom is a sort of civil affront  It is kind  tho' it may be difficult  to conceal from a dear Friend those griefs which cannot be relieved  Misfortunes give a call to discharge the noblest offices of Friendship  Great minds carry their Friendship beyond accidents and ties of blood  Fervent Friendships seldom subsist between two sisterbeauties both toasts  There is a consentaneousness in some minds which will unite them stronger to each other in a few hours than can be done in years with some others whom yet we see not with disgust  An active spirit in one Friend and a passive one in the other is likely to make their Friendship durable  A great error ought less to be excused in one we value than in one to whom we are indifferent  True Friendship will make a person careful to shun every appearance that may tend to debase it by selfish or sordid views  No Friendship but what is virtuous can be worthy of that sacred name  There are Friendships that are only bottledeep  Friendships with gay people who became intimate because they were gay the reason for their first intimacy ceasing will fade  The Friendship of gay people and of free livers ought more properly to be called  C  mpanionship    Ladies conspicuously worthy givesignificance to those whom they honour with their intimacy  The ties of pure Friendship are more binding and tender than those of nature  It is disgraceful to be thought to be the intimate Friend of a profligate and incorrigible man  There is an exalted pleasure in intellectual Friendship that cannot be tasted in the gross fames of sensuality  Warmth becomes Friendship when our Friend is struggling with undeserved calamity  I have no notion  says Miss Howe  of coolness in Friendship be it disguised or distinguished by the name of  Prudence  or what it will  It is not every one who has a soul capable of Friendship  One day profligate men will be convinced that what they call Friendship is chaff and stubble and that nothing is worthy of that sacred name that has not virtue for its base  The good opinion we have entertain'd of a person we have once thought worthy of it is not to be lightly given up  Friendship generally speaking is too fervent a flame for female minds to manage  Col Morden    A light that but in few of their hands burns steady and often hurries the Sex into flight and absurdity and like other extremes is hardly ever durable  Col Morden    Ma  riage which is the highest state of Friendship generally absorbs the most vehement Friendship of female to female  What female mind is capable of two fervent Friendships at the same time  The following are the requisites according to  Col Morden  of fervent and  urable female Friendship to wit That both should  like Clarissa and Miss Howe  have enlarged hearts a good education and minds thirsting after virtuous knowlege  That they should be nearly of equal fortunes in order to be above that dependence on each other which frequently destroys the familiarity that is the cement of Friendship  That each should excel in different ways that there might not be room for either to envy the other  That each should be something in the other to fear as well as to love  That it should be an indispensable condition of their Friendship each to tell the other of her failings and to be thankful for the freedom taken  That the one should be by  nature  gentle the other  made so  by her love and admiration of her Friend  Gaming  GAming is equaly a waster of time and tal  nts  Except for trifles what prudent person would submit to Chance what they are already sure of  It is making my friends a very ill compliment  says Clarissa  to suppose they wish to be possessed of what belongs to me and I should be very unworthy if I desir'd to make myself a title to what is theirs  High Gaming is an immorality a sordid vice the child of avarice and a direct breach of that commandment whch forbids us to covet what is our neighbour's  Generosity Generous Minds  REserves are painful to open and free spirits  Generous Minds are rather to be invited than intimidated  A generous spirited woman to be happy should take care not to marry a sordid man  A generous mind will love the person who corrects her in love the better for the correction  The tenderest and most generous minds when harshly treated frequently become the most inflexible  Generosity engages the nobleminded as strongly as Love  Undue displeasure when appearing to a generous Mind undue will procure to the supposed offender high amends  Nobleminded persons in the exertion of their munificence silently reproach the rest of the world  Tho' a generous person may wish she had not been laid under obligations for a benefit unrequestedly conferr'd on herself or her dependents yet she cannot but love the obliger the more for the exertion of a spirit so like her own  A generous person highly praised will endeavour to deserve the good opinion of the applauder that she may not at once disgrace his judgment and her own heart  A truly generous and candid Mind will often make excuses for other people in cases where it would not have allow'd of one for itself  A generous Mind cannot abuse a generous confidence  A truly generous Spirit will in requisite cases give advice against itself  A frank or openminded person at once where he likes mingles Minds and is forward to dissipate diffidences  A generous Spirit cannot enjoy its happiness without communication  The person who has the advantage in an argument and is incapable on insult or triumph upon it will disappoint envy and subdue illwill  True Generosity is more than Politeness it is more than good Faith it is more than Honour it is more than Justice since all these are but duties  The Man who would be thought generous must first be just  A generous Mind will not take pleasure in vexing even those by whom it has been distress'd  Leave should not be waited for to do a right a just a generous thing if it be in one's power to do it  It may be very generous in one person to offer what ir would be ungenerous in another to accept  A person of a Mind not ungenerous will rather be sorry for having given an offence than displeased at being amicably told of it  Generous Minds are always of kin  A generous Mind must be uneasy when it is laid under obligations which are beyond its power to return  Love and Gratitude will not be narrow'd down to mere familyconsiderations  It is generous to take the part of an absent pe  son if not flagrantly culpable  Generosity is the happy medium between parsimony and profuseness  A generous Mind will not scruple to give advantage to a person of merit tho' not always to her own advantage    See  Friendship Goodness  Goodness Grace  A Good person will not wilfully incur the censure even of an adversary  A good man need not be afraid that his conduct should be pry'd into  Goodness is greatness  A good person far from being guilty of a falshood will not have recourse to equivocation  People  says Lovelace  who act like Angels ought to have Angels to deal with  How great a satisfaction is it to a good mind to be able to reflect that it has rather  suffered  than  offered  wrong  A good man will not make the slumbers of a worthy woman uneasy  A worthy person will be always ready to draw favourable conclusions on the actions and words of others  A good person will wish to make every one happy even to her very servants  Goodness and generosity of sentiments give grace and lustre to beauty  A good woman will have other views in living than the common ones of eating sleeping dressing visiting  c  Goodness must be uniform  The word Grace is the Rake's Shibboleth There are no hopes of one who can make a jest of it or of him who uses it  A goodnatured and polite person will not expose even pretenders to science in their absence to the ridicule of lively spirits    See  Friendship Virtue  Gratitude Ingratitude  IT is Ingratitude and Tyranny in a woman to use a man the wors  for his respect to her  A thankful spirit is the same as a joyful one  We must be greatly sensible of the Ingratitude of those we love  To take advantage of an innocent creature's good opinion to her own detriment or ruin is the most ungrateful wickedness that can be committed by man  Particular instances of Ingratitude in another to us should not be permitted to narrow and contract our charity into general doubt or jealousy  Grief Sorrow Grievances  WHen grievances are to be enumerated slight matters are often thrown in to make weight that otherwise would not have been complained of  That silence wants not either merit or amiableness which is owing to the person's being afraid of discovering by his  voice  the depth of his concern  What a poor passive machine is the body when the mind is disordered  Sorrow makes an ugly face odious  Lovel  Those who mourn for a lost friend will find their Grief very much abated when they are themselves attacked by a dangerous or painful illness  Lovel  Grief  says Lovelace  is a slow worker and gives time to pop in a little joy between its sullen fits  It is the humble silent Grief that only deserves pity  How anxiously do we pray for the life of a dear child in its illness which when grown to maturity we have reason to wish had not been granted to our prayers  Those who fly from home to avoid an heavy scene labour under more distress in the intermediate suspense than they could have were they to be present at it  Seasonable and necessary employments should be found out to amuse and to divert persons suffering under violent Grief or loss of dearest friends  It is natural for us in every deep and sincere Grief to interest in it all we know  Grief  for the loss of friends  may be mellowed by time into remembrances more sweet than painful  See  Adversity Consolation  Guilt Vice Wickedness Evil Habits Evil Courses  HAbits are not easily changed  Vice is a coward and will hide its head when steadily oppo  ed by an advocate for virtue  What must be the force of evil Habits in a man who  thinks  r  ght yet disgraces his knowlege by  acting wrong  The guilty eye will sink under an examining one that is innocent  The Guilty less bear the detecting truth than the innocent do the degrading falshood  Bad men take more pains to be wicked than it would cost them to be good  The sun shines alike upon the bad and the good but the guilty mind it cannot illuminate  Every vice generally brings on its own punishment  The injured will often sweetly sleep when the injurer cannot close his eyes  There can hardly be a greater punishment hereafter  says Lovelace reflecting on his last outrage on Clarissa  than that which I at this instant experience in my own remorse  What a dejection must ever fall to the lot of  Guilt says Lovelace on Clarissa's behaviour in the Penknife Scene  were it given to  Innocence  always thus nobly to exert itself  Many people are deterred from Evil rather by the fear of detection than by principle  To plunder a wreck and to rob at a fire are the most barbarous of all villainies  Sins presumptuously committed against knowlege and against warning are the most unpardonable of all others  Those who cannot stand the shock of public shame ought to be doubly careful that they incur not private Guilt that may bring them to it  Guilt when detected is literally speaking its own punisher even in this world since it makes the haughtiest spirits look like miscreants  Evil Courses can no longer yield pleasure than while thought and reflection can be kept off    See  Innocence Ingratitude Libertine Remorse Repentance  Happiness Content  IT is happy for a person to leave the world possessed of every one's love  Happiness and Riches are two things and very seldom meet together  Were we perfect which no one  can  be we could not be happy in this life even in the usual acceptation of the word unless those with whom we have to deal and more especially those who have any controul over us were governed by the principles by which we ourselves are directed  To  know  we are happy and not to leave it to afterreflection to look back upon the preferable Past with an heavy and self accusing heart is the highest of human felicities  What an happiness must that man know who moves regularly to some laudable end and has nothing to reproach himself with in his progress to it  The Heiress to Content is the richest heiress that can be sought after  See  Friendship Generosity Goodness  Health  SOund Health will make the soul and body pleased with each other  Poverty is the mother of Health  Temperance will give Health and Vigour to an originally tender constitution  Health disposes us to be pleased with ourselves and then we are in a way to be pleased with every one else  In Health every hope rises upon us every hour presents itself to us on dancing feet  What Mr Addison says of Liberty may with still greater propriety be said of Health for what is Liberty itself without Health  It makes the gloomy face of Nature gay  Gives beauty to the Sun and pleasure to the Day  Men of very strong bodily Health seldom know how to pity the sick or infirm  See  Physic Vapours  Heart Humanity  HE that wants an heart wants everything  A wrong head may be convinced but who can give an Heart where it is wanting  The person who wants a feeling Heart wants the highest joy in this life Yet is saved many griefs by that defect  Where the Heart in all important cases involuntarily as may be said misgives its misgivings ought generally to be attended to as if the impulses of Conscience  It is more to a man's praise to shew a kind Heart than a cunning head  Persons of Humanity will not be ashamed on proper occasions to shew by their eyes that they have feeling Hearts  Women should make it a rule to judge of the Heart of a man as he is or is not affected by the woes of others whether real or represented  He who can place his pride in a barbarous insensibility is ignorant of the principal glory of the Human Nature  Who can be happy  says Lovelace  and have a feeling Heart yet he who has it not must be a Tyger and no Man  Even those people who have bad Hearts will have a veneration for those who have good ones  What the unpenetrating world call Humanity is often no more than a weak mind pitying itself  Lovel  A capacity of being moved by the distresses of our fellowcreatures is far from being disgraceful to a manly Heart  Sweet is the pain which generous natures feel for the distresses of others  A kind Heart is a greater blessing to its possessor than it can be to any other person who may receive benefit from it    See  Friendship Generosity Goodness  Honesty  WHat a praise is it to Honesty that every man pretends to it even at the instant that he knows he means to be a knave  Honesty is the chief pride of the low In the high the love of power of grandeur of pleasure mislead and induce a paramount pride which too often swallows up the more laudable one  What is there in this dull word or thing call'd Honesty  asks Lovelace  that even I cannot help thinking the temporary emanation of it in such a man as Tomlinson amiable  It is so much every one's duty to be honest that no one has merit in being so every honest man therefore may call himself honest without the imputation of vanity  See  Goodness  Human Life  THE plainest path in our journey thro' life is  as acknowleges Lovelace  the safest and the best  In all human affairs the convenient and inconvenient the good and the bad are so mingled that there is no having the one without the other  As Human Life is chequerwork a person of prudence will set so much good against so much bad in order to strike a balance  When can creatures who hold by so uncertain a tenure as that of Mortality be said to be  out of danger  This is one of those common forms of speech that prove the frailty and the presumption of poor mortals at the same time  What are ten twenty or thirty years to look back to in the longest of which periods forward we shall all perhaps be mingled with the dust from whence we sprung  What is even the longest Life that in high health we wish for what as we go along but a Life of apprehensions sometimes for our friends and oftener for ourselves  And at last when arrived at the old age we covet one heavy loss or deprivation having succeeded another we see ourselves stripped as may be said of every one we lov'd and exposed as uncompanionable poor creatures to the flights of jostling youth who want to push us off the stage in hopes to possess what we have  And superadded to all our own infirmities every day encreasing of themselves enough to make the Life we wish for the greatest disease of all  To wish for an exemption from all infelicities were to wish for that which can never happen in this world and what perhaps ought not to be wish'd for if by a wish we could obtain it since we are not to live always  See  Consolation  Human Nature  NAture gives us relations that choice would not have made such  What a world is this one half of

byas which it would give a person pain to contend with  It is but shaping the bribe to the taste and every one has his price  Lovel  The clown as well as his betters practises what he censures and censures what he practises  In every human breast some one passion generally breaks thro' principle and controuls us all  Lovel  In some things we all err  Those who err on the unfavourable side of a Judgment are like to be in the right five times in six So vile a thing is Human Nature  says Lovelace    See  Detraction  Humility  HUmility must be the ornament of an high condition  Persons of Humility and Affability by their sweetness of manners insensibly draw people into their sentiments  All human excellence is but comparative There may be persons who excel us as much as we fansy we

the instruction which a man should be qualified to give  The heart not the figure of a man is what should determine a woman in the choice of an Husband  Sobriety in a man is a great point to be secured since so many mischiefs happen thro' excess  As obedience is made a part of the matrimonial vow a woman should not teach a man by a failure in that to dispense with perhaps  more  material parts of his  The principal views of a good Wife in adorning her person should be to preserve her Husband's affection and to do credit to his choice  A married woman should be even  fearful  of attracting the eyes of any man but those of her Husband  A gloomy spirit in an Husband will swallow up a chearful one in his Wife  Greatness of soul is required in a woman of sense and generosity to make her in her heart for bear to despise a lowminded Husband  Husbands are often jealous of their authority and consequence with women who have wit  A Wife is the keeper of her Husband's honour  A Wife's faults in the world's eye bring more disgrace upon the Husband than even upon herself  The Wife by infidelity may do more injury to the Husband than the Husband can to the Wife  Handsome Husbands often make a Wife's heart ake  Handsome Husbands think the women they marry under obligation to them  An Husband and Wife may be too much of one temper to agree  Two persons of tempers not comparatively bad may be very unhappy if they will be both out of humour at one time  It is a most affecting thing to be separated by death from a good Husband and left in destitute circumstances and that not by  his  fault  A wise man will rather endeavour to inspire a consciousness of dignity in the heart of his Wife than to depress and humble her in her own eyes  Prudence virtue and delicacy of mind in a Wife do a man more honour in the eyes of the world than the same qualities in himself  A good woman will be as delicate of her Husband's honour as of her own  A good Wife will think it her duty to lay up out of her own separate provision if not a too scanty one for the family good and for accidents  A tyrant Husband  says Lovelace  makes a dutiful Wife  The virtue of a woman who has a bad Husband is always in danger  A proud and bad spirit cannot bear a superiority of talents in a Wife tho' she and all her excellencies are his in full property  A bountifultemper'd Wife should take care that by doing  more  than justice to others she does not  less  than justice by her Husband  To bear much with some Wives is to be under a necessity to bear more  Husbands and Wives who live together in good understanding give to strangers an almost unerring proof of the goodness of their hearts  Happy is the marriage where neither Man nor Wife has any wilful or premeditated evil  or low cunning  to reproach each other with  What good principles  says Lovelace  must that Wife have who  in temptation  preserves her faith to a man who has no share in her affections  It is impossible that a man of a cruel nature of a sportive invention and who has an high opinion of himself and a low one of the Female Sex should make a tender and good Husband  A prudent Wife will conquer by yielding  Women should consider that a man who is made uneasy at home can divert himself abroad which a woman cannot so easily do without scandal  The managing Wife if prudent may lay a seeming obligation on a me  k or goodnatured Husband by the performance of no more than her duty  See  Advice to Women Courtship Marriage  Hypocrisy  THE man who has actually prevail'd with a woman to threw herself into his power has no occasion for Hypocrisy  What an Hyaena is the woman who will put her handkerchief to her eye oftener than she wets it  A text of scripture is often  Lovelace says  a cloak for an Hypocrite  See  Human Nature  Illwill Envy Hatred Malice Spite  WHom we fear more than love we are not far from hating  Illwill if it cannot find occasions of disgust will make them  Merit and excellence are the fuel that keeps envy alive  Envy and Illwill often extend their malignancy to the whole families of the hated person  Illwill has eyes ever open to the faulty side as goodwill or love is blind even to real imperfections  Hatred is an enemy even to the common forms of civility  Projects form'd in Malice and founded in Selfishness ought to be disappointed  Hatred misrepresents all things  Spiteful people will sometimes shew gaiety and favour to one they value not merely to vex another with whom they are displeased  Absence heightens Malice  Hatred and Anger are but  temporary  passions in worthy minds  Where the ear is open to accusation accusers will not be wanting  Imagination  THE Female Sex have great advantages over the other in all the powers that relate to the Imagination  Persecution and Discouragement depress ingenuous minds and blunt the edge of lively imaginations  Whatever we strongly imagine is at the time more than imaginary altho' it may not appear so to others  Warm Imaginations are not without a mixture of Enthusiasm  Fancy or Imagination be the subject either joyous or grievous is able to outgo fact  People of strong imaginations are generally distinguished from people of judgment by their peculiar flights and whimsies  Inclination  Persons may be drawn in against inclination till custom will make an Inclination  Some people need no greater punishment than to be permitted to pursue their own Inclinations  Whatever our hearts are in  says Lovelace  our heads will follow  It is the art of the Devil and of Libertines to suit temptations to Inclinations  See  Libertine Love  Indiscretion Inconsiderateness Presumption  THE Indiscretions of a reputedly prudent person are a wound to Virtue  A great and w  lful Indiscretion not only debases a person in her own eyes but weakens her authority and influence over others  It is one of the cruellest circumstances that attend the faults of the Inconsiderate that she makes all who love her unhappy and gives joy only to the enemies of her family  Presumption join'd to Inexperience is often the ruin even of wellmeaning persons  A worthy mind drawn into an Indiscretion will have as much concern for the pain given by it to those she loves as for the disgraces brought upon herself  See  Advice to Women  Infidel Scoffer  THere can be no hope of a man of profligate life whose vices have taken root in Infidelity  Those who know least are the greatest Scoffers  says Belford    Scoffers generally censure without knowlege laugh without reason and are noisy and loud on things of which they know the least  Belf    See  Guilt Religion  Innocence  AN innocent man may despise obloquy  An innocent person doubted will not fear his tryal  Innocence according to its company had better have a greater mixture of the serpent with the dove than it generally has  Lovel  Happy is the person who can say with Clarissa  "I should be glad that all the world knew my heart Let my enemies sit in judgment upon my actions fairly scann'd I tear not the result"  "Let them even ask me my most secret thoughts and whether the revealing of them make for me or against me I will reveal them"  An innocent person being apt to judge of others hearts by his own is the easiest to be imposed upon  See  Goodness Virtue  Insolence  THE man who can fawn and creep to those by whom he hopes to be a gainer will be insolent and overbearing to those on whom he can have no such view  Indoor Insolents who frighten women children and servants are generally cravens among men  Insolent controul more effectually subdues a female spirit than kindness and concession  Some people act by others as if they thought patience and forbearance necessary on  one side  to be upon good terms together but always take care rather to  owe  than to  lay  the obligation  People who find their anger has made them considerable will seldom be pleased  Concessions made to ungenerous spirits serve only to confirm them in their insolence  Insolence is the parent of meanness  See  Guilt Libertine  Judgment  AN error  against  Judgment is infinitely worse than an error  in  Judgment  In order to form a Judgment of the tempers of men with whom we incline to have a close connexion we should attend to their behaviour upon slight disappointments or provocations and then we shall be able perhaps to decide what is to be ascribed to art in them and what to nature  She who acts up to the  best  of her Judgment at the time she is called upon to act has the less to blame herself for tho' the event should prove unfavourable  The eye and the heart when too closely allied are generally at enmity with the Judgment  To judge of the reasonableness of the conduct and resentment of others we ought to put ourselves exactly in their situations  Justice Injustice Right Wrong  IN an unjust donation the giver and receiver  the latter knowing it to be so  are both culpable  There is a Right and Wrong in everything let people put what gloss they will upon their actions  A woman may then doubt the Justice of her cause wh  n those who loved her and are not principals in the point in debate condemn her  A man reflects upon himself and upon the company he has kept if he treats common instances of Justice Gratitude and Benevolence as extraordinary  Libertine as I am thought to be  says Lovelace  I never will attempt to bring down the measure of Right and Wrong to the standard of my own actions  Those who take advantage of the necessities of their fellowcreatures in order to buy anything cheaper than the real worth are no better than robbers for the difference  There never was a woman so criminal who had not some to justify and side with her  In all Recommendations the good and convenience of  both  parties should be consulted  If reflections are justly thrown upon us we ought instead of resenting to profit by them  If unjust we ought to despise them and the reflector too since it would be inexcuseable to strengthen by anger an enemy whose malice might be disarmed by contempt  Justice no less than Mercy is an Attribute of the Almighty  Keepers Keeping  A Man may keep a woman but not his estate  Rakes who despise matrimony often become the dupes of lowbred women who govern them more absolutely than a wife would attempt to do  Keepers who are in possession of estates by legal descent will not wish that their Fathers had despised Matrimony as they do  Ought not Keepers to have the same regard for posterity as their Fathers had  How can anything be expected but riot and waste from creatures who know the uncertain tenure by which they hold and who have an interest quite different from that of their Keepers  Many considerations withhold a wife from infidelity to a man's bed that cannot weigh with a mistress  Men who keep women as little know how to part with them as if they were married to them  Men will bear many things from a kept mistress which they would not bear from a wife  Kept women who are generally lowborn loweducated creatures can make no other returns for the partnership in a man's fortunes into which they are lifted but the libidinous ones which a man cannot boast of but to the disgrace of both  A Keeper as he advances into years will find his appetite to Libertinism go off and that the regular familylife will be more and more palatable to him  Many considerations respecting himself and his illegitimate children should weigh with a man who keeps a mistress and despises wedlock  The man who is capable of fondness to his offspring and has a feeling heart will marry  The natural fruits of treading in crooked paths are dangers disgrace and a toolate repentance  Keepers are often the cullies of their own Libertinism sliding into the married state will their wellworn doxies which they might have enter'd into with their ladies or superiors  See the remarkable story of Tony Jenyns a noted Keeper  vol iv p  And of Mr Belton and his Thomasine  vol iv p  Old men imagining themselves under obligation to their young paramours seldom keep anything from their knowlege  A consuming malady and a consuming mistress  as in Belton's case  are dreadful things t  struggle with in the last stage of life  Hardly ever was there a Keeper that made not a Keeperess  In the last stage of a Keeper's life the Mistress's more favoured gallant has been sometimes his Physician the dying man's Will has been ready made for him and Widow's weeds have been provided the moment he is departed in order to establish a marriage    See  Libertine  Law Lawyer  THE Law asserts not itself until it is offended  Old Practisers in the Law value themselves too much for dispatch upon their skill as draughtsmen  The Lawyers who for the sake of a paltry fee undertake to make black white and white black endeavour to establish iniquity by quirks and to rob the innocent And are as base  Lovelace says  as his and old Sinclair's vile implement Dorcas  The Law is a word that carries in it natural terror to a guilty mind  No wonder it should  says Lovelace  since those who will damn themselves to procure ease and plenty in the world must tremble at everything that seems to threaten their methods of obtaining that ease and plenty  It is but glossing over one part of a story and omitting another  says Lovelace  that will make a bad cause a good one  Learning  A Letter'd education too generally sets the children of the poor above those servile offices by which the business of the world is carried on  Take the world thro' there are twenty happy people among the unletter'd to one among those who have had a schooleducation  Yet who would not wish to lift to some little distinction and genteel usefulness the person he desires to reward  The little words in the Republic of Letters like the little folks in a nation are the most useful and significant  A man of the deepest Learning may hear something from even a mean preacher that he knew not before or at least that he had not considered in the same light  The early Learning of women which chiefly consists in what they pick up from inflaming Novels and improbable Romances contributes greatly to enervate and weaken their minds  Libertine Rake  THE man wants but an opportunity to put in practice the crimes he is not ashamed to have imputed to him  A Libertine Lover if preferred to a virtuous one is more likely to justify the  dislike  of his opposers than the  choice  of his favourer  Rakes are more suspicious than honest men  Libertines by the frailty of those women they have triumphed over judge of the whole Sex  "  Once subdued and always subdued  " is an article in the Rake's Creed  A Libertine who is a man of sense and knowlege must have taken great pains to suppress many good motions and reflections as they arose in his mind or levity must be surprisingly predominant in it  The chief pleasure of a Libertine must arise from the pain the suspense the anguish of mind which he gives to the heart of a woman he pretends to love  A Libertine believes that no woman can be chaste or virtuous from principle  Every woman who favours a Libertine confirms him in his bad opinion of the Sex  If a woman loves a Libertine how will she bear the thought of sharing her interest in him with half the town and those perhaps the dregs of it  Prayers tears and the most abject submission are fuel to the pride of a Libertine  Fortunes squander'd estates mortgaged or sold and posterity robb'd are too often the result of a marriage with a Libertine  A Libertine familiarized to the distresses he occasions is seldom betrayed into a tenderness foreign to his nature  A Libertine will be more ashamed of shewing compassion by a weeping eye than of the most atrocious crimes  Libertines  as well as women love them  have not the ardors  Miss Howe says  that honest men have  Libertines are generally more severe exactors of implicit obedience and rigorous virtue than other men  No man who can think but of half the plagues that pursue an intriguing spirit would ever quit the foreright path  A man who when old would enjoy in peace his own reflections  Lovelace confesses  should never be a Rake  The friendships and intimacies of Libertines are only calculated for strong life and health  What an ungrateful what an unmanly what a meaner than reptile pride is his whose delight is in the ruin of a person who confides in his honour and whom he ought to protect  Men of gallantry and intrigue are the instruments of Satan to draw poor souls into those subtile snares which at last will entangle their own feet  Libertines are infinitely worse animals than beasts of prey since these destroy thro' hunger and necessity only those from wantonness and sport    See  Advice to Women Courtship Cruelty Men and Women Parents and Children Vows Wit  Little Spirits Meanness Narrowness  SOME Persons have Meanness in their very pride and their Narrowness goes hand in hand with it  Like little Souls will find one another out as well as like great ones  Little Spirits will always accommodate themselves to the tempers of those they want to work upon  Grudging and narrow Spirits know not how to confer a benefit with that grace which gives the principal merit to a beneficent action  One Meanness is not to be justified by another  To be afraid of little Spirits is to encourage insults  Meanness must ever be the portion of the man who is detected in acting vilely  Tame Spirits will ever be imposed upon  There is a malignancy in Litte Minds which makes them wish to bring down the worthy to their own level  Nothing subjects the human mind to so much Meanness as the consciousness of having dore wilful wrong to our fellowcreatures  People of narrow Spirits will praise generous ones because they find it to their purpose that all the world but themselves should be openminded  Narrowminded persons judging by their own hearts impute pride and ostentation to worthy persons as their motives to good actions    See  Covetousness Partiality Self  Love  THE Love which has not taken root deep enough to shoot out into declaration will not be brought forward by the blighting winds of anger or resentment  Love takes deepest root in the steadiest minds  Gratitude is not always to be construed into Love  That Lion Love is not to be turned into a Lapdog  Prodigies tho' they obtain our admiration never attract our Love  Love to look back upon must appear to be a very foolish thing when it has brought a person born to affluence into indigence and laid a generous mind under obligation and dependence  What is commonly called Love is a narrow circumscribed selfish passion and where the object of it is unworthy a passion too ignoble for a pure mind to encourage  Pride and vanity are often the source of Love  A person truly in Love will be wholly engross'd by one object  Love will acquit where Reason condemns  A prudent person will watch over the first approaches of Love  'Tis a degree of impurity in a woman to love a sensual man  Great encouragement must be given to Love to make it unconquerable  Unrequited  or slighted  Love frequently turns to deepest hate  Love delights to tame the lionhearted  What a worse than Molochdeity is Love if it expects an offering to be made to its shrine of reason duty and discretion  Love is a passion that often begins in folly or thoughtlessness and to carried on with perveseness  Love is as busy as a Monkey and as mischievous as a Schoolboy  says Miss Howe    Violent Love is a fervor like all other fervors that lasts but a little while  Love is generally founded on mere notional excellences  Time and discretion will enable a woman to get over a first passion  Love that deserves the name obliges the Lover to seek the satisfaction of the beloved object more than his own  True Love is ever accompanied with fear and reverence  A quarrel  says Miss Howe  has sometimes its conveniencies in Love And more or less  adds Lovelace  all Lovers quarrel  Love is a fleeting thing little better than a name where morality or virtue does not distinguish the object of it  Silent awe the humble doubting eye and even the hesitating voice are the natural indications of true and respectful Love  True Love is fearful of offending  Weakness  Lovelace says  is the  true  name for Love  All the world is ready to excuse a fault owing to Love because all the world is apt to be misled by it  Love was ever a traitor to its harbourer  Lovel  Love is not naturally a doubter  That avow'd Love which is follow'd by marriage however headstrong and indiscreet will have more excuses made for it than generally it ought to find  It is all over with  reasoning  Ladies  Lovelace says  when once Love gets into their heads  Platonic Love is Platonic Nonsense  A first passion thoroughly subdued often makes the man a rover the woman a tyranness  If Love is allowed to be an excuse for the most unreasonable follies what is meant by the doctrine of  subduing our passions  What must be that Love which has not some degree of purity for its object  A  worthy  woman who consents to marry need not be urged explicitly to declare her Love  The proof of true Love is respect not freedom  Love is an encroacher Love never goes backward Nothing but the highest act of Love can satisfy an  indulged  Love  Love and Compassion are hard to be separated  Love is seldom the friend of Virtue  Lovel  Love humanizes the fiercest spirits  Love is a fire that if play'd with will burn the fingers  Love hardly ever was under the dominion of prudence or of any reasoning power  Lovel  What  once  a woman hopes in Lovematters she  always  hopes while there is room for hope  Lovel  Respectful Love is an inspirer of actions worthy of itself  As the graces of the  mind  are improveable in every added year of life which will impair the transitory ones of  person  upon what a firm basis does that man build his Love who admires a woman for the former more than for the latter  Love will draw an Elephant thro' a keyhole  Love not always admits of an air of even  due  dignity to the object of it  A first Love overcome makes a person indifferent to a second  Love at first Sight  WE wish in compliment to our own sagacity to be confirmed in our firstsighted impressions  But few firstsighted impressions ought to be encouraged  Shall it be said of any young Lady that the powers of fancy are too hard for her duty and prudence  All women from the Countess to the Cookmaid are put into high good humour with themselves when a man is taken with them at first sight  Lovel  And be she ever so plain she will find twenty good reasons to defend the judgment of such a man  Lover  WHEN a Lover is easy he is sure  The Lover gains a great point when he can bring a young Lady to correspond with him privately and against prohibition  Lovers disposed to write upon a plaintive subject will often make their Ladies cruel when they only  ought  to be so and  are not Lovel  The tempers of Lovers whether gentle or ungentle are to be found out by the manner of their address in courtship  The man who shews tenderness for the calamities of others gives a moral assurance that he will make a good husband  A woman can have but small hopes of a Lover over whom his own  worthy  relations can have no influence  The small still voice of supplication denotes and becomes the modest Lover  A Lady can hardly ever esteem as an husband the man whom as a Lover sh  despises  How pleasantly can a false Lover pass his time while the gentle bosom of a Lady heaves with pity for his supposed sufferings for her  A blustering braving Lover cannot deserve encouragement  A Lover has not a right to be displeased with a Lady on her side of the solemnity  It is better for a Lady that her Lover should go away displeased with her than that he should leave her dissatisfied with herself  A generous Lover must seek to oblige the object of his Love in every thing essential to her honour and peace of mind  When people set out wrong together it is very difficult to avoid recrimination  The more ardent the man is while a  Lover  the more indifferent very probably will he be when an husband  Lovers chuse to be alone and are ashamed to have even a child present to witness to their foolish action and more

the nuptial preparations and the pride of becoming the mistress of a family  It is neither just nor honest to marry where there can be no Love  Women should be allowed to judge of the person with whom

ill compliment to herself when she changes her condition for  superfluities  if she has not superior or stronger motives  Honeymoon lasts nowadays but a fortnight  Ant Harlowe    A prudent man will not wish to marry a woman who has not an heart to give  How much easier and pleasanter is it for a woman to obey the man of her choice than one she would not have had could she have avoided it  No matter whom that woman marries who has a slight notion of the matrimonial duty  That woman who accompanies to the Altar a man to whom she is averse will find it difficult afterwards if she prefers her own peace of mind to avoid the necessity of playing the hypocrite with him  Those who marry from motives of convenience and duty are generally more happy than those who marry for Love  Persons of discretion  says Miss Howe  are apt to  consider  too much to marry  Invectives against Marriage are a reflection upon the laws and good order of society and upon a man's own ancestors and are more inexcuseable in m  n  f family than in others  A choice made by what is called Love is seldom durably happy because Love generally exalts the object above its merits and makes the Lover blind to faults which on a nearer intimacy are so obvious that both parties often wonder how they could be so grossly cheated  It is absolutely necessary to complete happiness in the married State  says Lovelace  that one should be a fool But then that fool should know the other's superiority otherwise the obstinate one would disappoint the wise one  A man of spirit would not marry a Princess if he

Stings of conscience from a wrong behaviour in a first Marriage may possibly make the faulty person tolerable in a second  It is the most cruel of fates for a woman to be forced to marry a man whom she in her heart despises  The  queernesses  which old Antony Harlowe says he has seen in families where the man and wife lived upon the best terms made him loth to marry  Marriage is a state that ought not to be entered into with indifference on either side  Large settlements in Marriage make a woman independent and a rebel of course  Lovel  In unequal Marriages those frequently incur censure

fighting against a Lover frequently fight for him  Daughters  says James Harlowe  are chickens brought up for a stranger's table  Most unhappy is the situation of that  worthy  Child who is obliged in her own defence to expose a Parent's failings  It is impolitic in Patents to join two people in one interest whom they wish for ever to keep asunder  Tho' the parental authority should be deemed sacred yet Parents should have reason in what they do  Where the heart of a Child is sought to be engaged the eye ought not to be disgusted  A worthy Daughter would rather wish to appear amiable in the eyes of her own Friends and Relations than in those of all the world besides  Disgraceful treatment will often bring about the very end which it is intended to frustrate  In family contentions when every expedient to bring about a reconciliation is tried whatever be the event the person so trying has the less to blame herself for  How great must be the comfort of that young Lady in an unhappy marriage who can reflect that she followed the advice of her Friends and owes not her unhappiness to her own headstrong will  The difference between the hard usage a Child receives from a severe Parent and the obsequious regard paid to her by a flattering Lover is enough to make her run all risks with the latter in order to get out of the hands of the former  Parents sometimes make not those allowances for Youth which when young they wished to be made for themselves  Parents must not always expect that  advice  should have the same force upon their Children as  experience  has upon themselves  In giving advice and remonstrating Parents and Guardians should proceed by patient reasoning and gentleness that they may not harden where they wish to convince  Unkind circumstances on the Parent's part and heedlese ones on the Child's in a debate where both mean well will make small differences great ones  A Parent by forcing a Child to marry the man she hates may occasion an utter dissipation of the Child's morals and of consequence her everlasting perdition  Aversion in a Child should be distinguished from wilfulness  To endeavour to force a free mind is to dishonour it  Strings that are overstrained must either be relaxed or break  The time may come for a Child to consider as the highest benefit to herself those measures of a Parent which at present she may think grievous  The more obstinate a Child is in her opposition to a Parent's will the more will a Patent be apt to think his authority concerned to carry his point  If Parents by appeals or otherwise needlesly expose a Child she will be apt to think that do what she will she cannot incur more disgrace than she already labours under  Harsh and cruel treatment humbles a Child and makes her seem  cheap  in her own eyes  Is she not I then in the way to become the easy prey of a man whom otherwise she would have despised  It is better for a good Child to be able to say her Parents were unkind to  her  than that she was undutiful to  them    The exertion of a seasonable lenity may save a penitent Child from utter destruction  The Father and Mother who would secure to themselves the undivided love of their Children should avoid such durable contentions with each other as would distress their Children which side to take when they would be glad to reverence both  A good Parent must have greater pain in the  necessary  restraint of an headstrong Daughter than she can give to such a Daughter  At every age on this side matrimony it will be found that a Parent's wings are the must effectual safeguards of Daughters from the villainous birds of prey that hover round them  A Parent for a failure in her own duty is not answerable to her Child  Reverence is too apt to be forgot by Children when Parents forget what belongs to their own characters  Parents and Children when separated and seeing each other but seldom like other lovers shew their best sides to each other  The bad qualities in which fond Parents too often indulge the  r Children when infants not seldom at riper years prove the plague of their hearts  It is as necessary to direct Daughters in the choice of their female companions and to watch against the intrigues of womenservants as it is to guard them against the designs of men  Lovel  Parents the most indulgent in their own natures often from the errors of a Child incur the censure of hardheartedness  Doubly faulty is that Child therefore who by a rash action not only disgraces herself but depreciates the most revered characters  What confusion of mind must attend the reflections of a child who from the most promising outsetting has brought ruin on herself and distress on her Friends  The voice of nature must at last be heard in favour of a Child truly penitent  When a Daughter is strongly set upon a point it is better for a Mother if the point be of no high consequence to make herself of her party than violently to oppose her  Parents should take care that they do not weaken their authority by a needless exertion of it  What an enormity is there in that crime of a Child which can turn the hearts of Parents before indulgent against her  The resentment which Children and even the World may ascribe to cruelty in an offended Parent may be owing to excess of love and disappointed hopes  It is to be hoped  says Miss Howe  that unforgiving Parents were always good dutiful and passive Children to  their  Parents  Parents who would cure a Child's impatience of spirit should not betray a want of temper in themselves  Children depending on the weakness of their Parents tempers too often harden their own hearts  While Parents  think  a Child in fault as they have a right to judge for themselves they ought to have great allowances made for them especially it till their displeasure took place they had always been kind and indulgent  Good Children make their Parents happy in  each other  as well as in  them  bad Children unhappy in both  When the nearest Friends give up an unhappy Child every one is ready to propagate slander against her  A good Child will be careful of making a party against even harsh and severe Parents  It requires an high degree of understanding and discretion in a Daughter when grown up to let it be seen that she mingles reverence with her love to a Parent who has talents visibly inferior to her own  Parents in order to preserve their Childrens veneration for them should take great care not to let them see anything in their conduct behaviour or principles which they themselves would not approve of in others  Such Parents as have a visible narrowness of heart must needs weaken their own authority with Children of spirit    See  Advice to Women Courtship Controul Duty Marriage Love Lover  Partiality Impartiality  MEN frequently give advice to others when consulted with an indirect view to something similar in their own case  Goodwill or Love is often blind to real imperfections  We are apt to praise our benefactors because they are  our  benefactors as if everybody did right or wrong as they obliged or disobliged  us    We should endeavour to judge of ourselves and of everything that affects us as we may reasonably imagine others will judge of us and of our actions  Were each person to tell his own story and to be believed there would not be a guilty person in the world  No one should plead the errors of another in justification of his own  Human nature sensible of its own defects loves to be correcting but chuses rather to turn its eye outward than inward  We often look into ourselves with a resolution not fairly to try but to acquit ourselves  It is difficult for a woman to subscribe to a preference against herself in lovecases tho' ever so visible  Poor arguments will do when brought in favour of what we like  An artful man bringing a case home to the passions or interest of his judges will be likely to succeed where he ought not  That cause must be well tried where the offender takes his seat upon the same bench with the judge  Whatever qualities we  wish  to find in one we love we are ready to find  Partiality to Self is a dangerous misleader  An impartial spirit having run into a punishable error will not forgive itself tho' its friends should forgive it  Those least bear disappointment who love most to give it  Many men are apt to take their measures of right and wrong from what they themselves  are  and cannot help  being    So aukwardness may be a perfection with the aukward  It is difficult to go out of ourselves to give a judgment

The manners and Passions of men and women are to be seen in miniature during their childhood  If the irascible passions cannot be overcome how shall those be subdued to which bad habit joined to greater temptation gives stronger force  It is easy to make a passionate spirit answer all our views upon it  Turbulence and obsequiousness used in turn keep a woman's passions alive and at last tire her into nonresistance  Miss Howe    People in a Passion tho' within a few yards of each other hollow like travellers got out of their way and wanting to get into it again  How universally engaging it is  says Lovelace  to put a woman of sense in a Passion let the reception given to the ranting scenes in Plays testify  Those Passions in women which they take no pains to subdue may have one and the same source  and tendency  with those which hurry on the headstrong and violent of the other Sex to the commission of the most atrocious crimes  Passion gives bodily strength Fear takes it away  Passion distorts the features and makes even an handsome person ugly  The Passions of the gentle tho' slower to be moved than those of the quick are generally the most flaming when raised  It is both impudent and imprudent  says Lovelace  for a wife to be in a Passion  Passion and illwill are dreadful misrepresenters  Violence of Passion is too often admitted as a plea  at least as an extenuation  for violence and indecency of action both by the female sex and by the world  To be able to arrest a woman's Passion in the height of its career  on an offence given to her modesty  is  says Lovelace  a charming presage  A woman of a violent Spirit is often in more danger from an artful man than one of a steadier disposition  Passionate women have high pulses  says Lovelace  and a clever fellow will make what sport he pleases with them  Who can account for the workings and ways of a passionate and disappointed woman  Lovel  Passion has different ways of working in different bosoms as humours

Violent Spirits  Patience Impatience  PErsons unaccustomed to controul are impatient of controul  If afflictions are sent for corrective ends Impatience may lead into more punishable errors  An impatient spirit subjects itself to deserved humiliation  When a point is clear and selfevident it is difficult to find Patience on being obliged to enter into an argument in proof of it  Patience and perseverance are able to overcome the greatest difficulties  No man ought to be impatient at imputations he is not ashamed to deserve  An innocent man  will not  be outrageous upon reports made to his disadvantage a guilty man  ought not    The injured has a right to upbraid the injurer ought to be patient  Persons who by their rashness have made a breach in their duty should not enlarge it by their Impatience  Impatience is generally the child of selfpartiality  The person who is employed as a mediator should not be himself overready to take offence  People new to misfortune are often too easily moved to Impatience  It is not just for two friends more than for man and wife to be out of Patience at one time  In a deep distress a man of an impatient spirit is apt to think that every face and even the face of nature should wear the marks of that woe which affects him  Pedants Colleges  YOuths raw from the Colleges are not fit prescribers to the gentler Sex  Colleges are too often

worse with physical ones  Lovel  Those who treat contemptuously the professors of the art of healing generally treat higher institutions as lightly  Clarissa    Sharp or acute mental organs frequently whet out the bodily ones  A generous physician where he is hopeless of doing good will put on the Friend and lay aside the Doctor  When physical men  says Belford  are at a loss what to prescribe to their patients they enquire what it is they best like or are most diverted with and forbid them that  Physicians to do credit to their skill will sometimes make a slight disease important  Lovel  We

A skilful operator will endeavour to be intelligible and if honest to make every one a judge of his practice  Generally  says Belford  when the Physician enters the air is shut out  Quantity in diet is more to be regarded than quality  A full meal is a great enemy both to study and industry  A worthy Physician will pay a regular and constant attendance upon his patient watching with his own eyes every change and every new symptom of his malady  He will vary his applications as indications vary  He will not fetter himself to rules laid down by the fathers of the art who lived many hundred years ago when diseases and the causes of them as also the modes of living and climates and accidents were different from what they are now  He should not be greedy of fees but proportion his

calamities in a like situation might have been our own  Disgraces brought on persons by themselves ought not to be pitied  In our attendances on a dying person we pity him for what he suffers and we pity ourselves for what we must one day in like manner suffer and so are doubly affected  The Pity which a rash child often meets with when she has  brought upon herself an irreparable evil should generally be transferred to her parents and friends  Pity from one often begets Pity from another whether the occasion for it be either strong or weak  God wants not anything of us for Himself He enjoins us works of mercy to one another as the means to obtain  His  mercy  The brave and the wise know both how to pity and excuse    See  Generosity Goodness Magnanimity  Politeness Travelling  POliteness constrained and not free is to be suspected  A person may not be polite and yet not characteristically unpolite  A manly sincerity and openness of heart are very consistent with true Politeness  Politeness is on the man's part necessary to gain a footing in a woman's heart But Miss Howe questions whether a little intermingled insolence is not necessary to keep that footing  A man's morality is often the price paid for travelling accomplishments  A polite man respecting a Lady will not treat contemptuously any of her relations  Men of parts and fortune frequently behave as if they thought they need not be gentlemen  Men in years too often think their age a dispensation from Politeness  Nothing can be polite that is not just or good    See  Dress  Political Precepts  A

only  where due shame if not principle would mend the world  It is a degree of affectation to decline joining in the due Praise of our own children because they are our own  Those who are accustomed to Praise will not be proud of it  A person too fond of Praise is apt to be misled by it  Those are generally most proud of Praise who least deserve it  Praise reproaches when applied to the undeserving  Praise will beget an emulation in a generous mind to deserve or to continue to deserve it  Those who praise with warmth the laudable actions of another where they themselves are not

EArlybegun Antipathies are not easily eradicated  Those we dislike can do nothing to please us  An extraordinary Antipathy in a young Lady to a particular person is generally owing to an extraordinary

thing  The contempt a proud great person brings on himself is a counterbalance for his greatness  It is sometimes easier to lay a proud man under obligation than to get him to acknowlege it  Pride ever must and ever will provoke contempt  There may be such an haughtiness in submission as may entirely invalidate the submission  A Person who distinguishes not may think it the mark of a great spirit to humour his Pride even at the expence of his politeness  It is to be feared there are more good and laudable actions owing to Pride than to Virtue  Pride and meanness are as nearly allied to each other as the poets tell us wit and madness are  Nothing more effectually brings down a proud spirit than a sense of lying under pecuniary obligations  Pride when it is native will shew itself sometimes in the midst of mortifications  Pride frequently eats up a man's prudence  Pride is an infallible sign of weakness or something wrong either in the heart or head or in both  It is possible for a person to be proud in supposing she has no Pride  We ought not to value ourselves on talents we give not to ourselves  How contemptible is that Pride which stands upon diminutive observances and gives up the most important duties  Some women have from Pride what others  more laudably  have from principle The Lord help the Sex  says Lovelace  if they had not Pride  Pride or Arrogance invites mortification  Haughty spirits when they are convinced that they have carried their resentments too high frequently want but a good excuse to condescend  Pride in man or woman is an extreme that hardly fails sooner or later to bring forth its mortifying contrary  Persons of accidental or shadowy merit may be proud but inborn worth must be always as much above conceit as arrogance  There is but one pride pardonable that of being above doing a base or dishonourable action    See  Humility Insolence Little Spirits  Procuress Profligate Woman  PEople at vile houses by producing sometimes to

vanity of  mere  human Prudence  A prudent and good Person who has been a little misled will do all in her power to recover as soon as possible her lost path  To avoid the supposed disgrace of retractation a prudent person will be backward to give her opinion in company of persons noted for their superior talents  A wise woman despising the imputation of prudery on one hand and coquetry on

bluster and make it roar when and at whom they please  Miss Howe    Women where they favour will make the slightest and even but a  fansy'd  merit excuse the most glaring vice  Women who have the rougher manners of men may be said to have the souls of men and the bodies of women  Women love to engage in knighterrantry themselves as well as to encourage it in men  A Rake  says Lovelace  has no reason to be an hypocrite when he has found his views better answered by his being known to be a Rake  How greedily do the Sex swallow praise  Lovel  Lovelace calls upon the Female Sex to account for the preference given by many  modest  women as they are accounted to a  Rake  when the most  impudent  of Rakes  says he  love  modesty  in a  woman    It concerns every woman  instructively says Lovelace  to prove by her actions that this preference is not owing to a  likeness  in  nature    There is  Lovelace says  such a perverseness in the Sex that when they ask your advice they do it only to know your opinion that they may oppose it  Women  says Lovelace  love to be called cruel even when they are kindest  The best of the Sex  says Lovelace  wish to have the credit of reforming a Rake and so draw themselves in with a very little of our help  Rakes and Libertines are the men  Miss Howe says  that women do not naturally dislike  Opposition and contradiction give vigour to female spirits of a warm and romantic turn  Women love Rakes  says Lovelace  because Rakes know how to direct their uncertain wills and to manage them  Nothing on earth is so perverse as a woman when she is set upon carrying a point and has a meek man or one who loves his peace to deal with  Lovel  Had I found that a character for virtue had been generally necessary to recommend me to the Sex I would  says Lovelace  have had a greater regard to my morals than I have had  When you would have a woman report a piece of intelligence  says Lovelace  you must enjoin her to keep it as a secret  Women love to have their Sex and their favours appear of importance to men  Lovel  Most of the fair Romancers have in their early womanhood chosen Lovenames  says Lovelace    Many a sweet dear  adds he  has answered me a Letter for the sake of owning a name which her godmother never gave her  An innocent woman  Lovelace says  who has been little in the world knows not what strange stories every woman living who has had the least independence of will could tell her  The whole Sex love plotting and plotters too  says Lovelace    Women like not novices  Lovel  They are pleased with a love of the Sex that is founded in the  knowlege  of itReason good  He proceeds to give the reasons in the same style very little to the credit of the Sex    Women are the greatest triflers in the creation  rudely

loveaffairs  The Sex love busy scenes  Lovel  A woman will create a storm rather than be without one  Lovel  Most unhappy is the Woman who is obliged to live in tumults which she neither raised nor can controul  Women are used to cry without grief and to laugh without reason  Lovel  Any  woman  says Lovelace  could I make good because I could make her  fear  me as well as  love  me  All women are born to intrigue and practise it more or less  Lovel  In loveaffairs women are naturally expert and much more quickwitted than men  Lovel  Friendship in women when a man comes in between the pair of friends is given up like their music and other maidenly amusements  Lovel  The mother who would wish her daughter to have one man would sometimes better succeed if she proposed another  Lovel  It is a common fault of the Sex  according to Lovelace  to aim at being young too long  Secrets of love and secrets of intrigue  Lovelace says  are the strongest cements of womens friendships  All women  says Lovelace  are cowards at heart They are only violent where they may  Women  says Lovelace  love those best whether men women or children who give them most pain  Girls who are never out of temper but  with  reason when that is given them hardly ever pardon or afford another opportunity of offending  Lovel  Vestals  says Lovelace  have been often warmed by their own fires  Revenge and obstinacy will make the best of women do very unaccountable things  Lovel  Women rather than not put out both the eyes of a man they are mortally offended with will put out one of their own  Lovel  Vile men owe much of their vileness even to women of character who hardly ever scruple to accompany and converse with them tho' they have been guilty of ever so much baseness to others  Women being generally modest and bashful themselves are too apt to consider that quality in the men which is their own principal grace as a defect and  finely  do they judge when they think of supplying that defect by chusing a man that cannot be ashamed  Ladies  Lovelace hints  often give denials only to be persuaded to comply in order to reconcile themselves to themselves  No woman is homely in her own opinion    See  Advice to Women Courtship Love Libertine Marriage Men and Women  Reformation Conviction Conversion  A Man can hardly be expected to reform who resolves not to quit the evil company he has been accustomed to delight in  Pretences to instantaneous Convictions are to be suspected  Conviction is half way to amendment  To reform by an enemy's malevolence is the noblest revenge in the world  Very few convictions arise from vehement debatings  The first step to Reformation is to subdue sudden gusts of passion and to be patient under disappointment  The most abandon'd of Libertines generally mean one day to reform  Should they not therefore even as Libertines resolve against atrocious guilt were it but to make their future compunction less pungent  Reformation cannot be a sudden work  There is more hope of the Reformation of a man of sense than of a fool  But this is a delusive hope and has been the cause of great mischief  for who thinks not the man she loves a man of sense The observations that follow are more the truth and deserve to be well considered  A man who errs with his eyes open and against conviction is the worse for what he knows  The man of parts and abilities who engages in a baseness knowing it to be so is less likely to be reclaimed than one who errs from want of knowlege or due conviction  Women think that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits  as Lovelace himself observes  is a much easier task than in the nature of things it can be  For Mr Belford's scheme of Reformation see Vol  vii p  Little hope can there be of reclaiming a man who is vile from premeditation  To what a bad choice is many a worthy woman betray'd by that false and inconsiderate notion raised and propagated no doubt by the author of all delusion  That a reformed Rake makes the best Husband  Belf  Little do innocents think what a total revolution of manners what a change of fixed habits nay what a conquest of a bad nature and what a portion of divine grace is required to make a profligate man a good husband a worthy father and a true friend from PRINCIPLE  It is an high degree of presumption for a woman to suppose her own virtue so secure as that she may marry a profligate in hopes to reclaim him  The sincerity of that man's Reformation is hardly to be doubted who can patiently bear being reminded of his past follies and when he can occasionally express an abhorrence of them    See  Goodness Religion Repentance  Religion Piety Devotion Sabbath  A Good man will not easily be put out of countenance  by scoffers  when the cause of Virtue and Religion is to be vindicated  There are men who think themselves too wise to be religious  There is something beautifully solemn in Devotion  says even Lovelace    The Sabbath  says he  is a most excellent institution to keep the heart right  It is a fine sight  adds he  to see multitudes of wellappearing people all joining in one reverent act an exercise how worthy of a rational being  If as religion teaches us we shall be judged in a great measure by our benevolent or evil actions to one another what must be the condemnation of those who have wilfully perpetrated acts of the most atrocious violence upon their innocent fellowcreatures  Libertines are generally for making a Religion to their practices  a wickedness which nevertheless Lovelace disclaims    Religion will teach us to bear inevitable evils with patience  Altho' I wish not for life  says Clarissa  yet would I not like a poor coward desert my  post  when I can maintain it and when it is my duty to maintain it  I will do everything I can  continues she  to preserve my life till God in mercy to me shall be pleased to call for it  Religious considerations timely enforced will prevent the heart from being seized with violent and fatal grief  Disappointments may bring on an indifference to this life but a truly pious resignation to death requires a better and deeper root  Enthusiasts often depreciate the Scriptures they mean to extol by abused and indiscriminate applications  Even a Lovelace disclaims as illmanners jesting upon Religion or religious men  A person of innate piety cannot think of shortening her own life whatever her calamities may be even by  neglect  much less by  violence    Our best prayer in affliction in doubtful or critical situations is That God's will may be done and that we may be resigned to it  Religion is the only refuge of an heart labouring under heavy and unmerited calamities  Religion enjoins us not only to forgive injuries but to return good for evil and Clarissa blesses God for enabling her to obey its dictates  Persons of Piety cannot permit resentment passion or anger to appear or have place in the last disposition of their secular affairs  God will have no rivals in the hearts which he sanctifies  Persons of Education and Piety will distinguish themselves as such even in their anger  It is a great mistake to imagine that Piety is not intirely consistent with goodnature and goodmanners  Religion if it has taken proper hold of the heart is  says Lovelace  the most chearful countenancemaker in the world  Sourness and moroseness indicate but a noviceship in Piety or Goodness  Lovel See  Goodness Virtue  Remorse  THE troubles of the injured are generally at an end when the injury is committed but when the punishment of the injurer will be over who can tell  Lovel  How often  says Lovelace  do we end in occasions for the deepest Remorse what we began in wantonness  The Remorse that is brought on merely by disappointment cannot be lasting  Nothing  says Lovelace  but the excruciating pangs which the condemned soul feels at its entrance into the eternity of the torments we are taught to fear can exceed what I now feel and have felt for this week past  What a dreadful thing is afterreflection upon a perverse and unnatural conduct  Heavy must be the reflections of those who on the loss of a worthy friend have acts of unmerited unkindness to that friend to reproach themselves with  Repentance Contrition  WHat is it that men propose who put off Repentance and Amendment but to live to  sense  as long as sense can relish and to reform when they can sin no longer  That Contrition for a guilt under which the guilty till detected was easy is generally to be ascribed to the detection and not to a due sense of the heinousness of the guilt  Repentance I have a notion  says Lovelace  should be set about while a man is in good health and spirits  What is a man fit for  not a new work surely  when he is not himself nor master of his faculties  Lovel  Hence as I apprehend it is that a deathbed repentance is supposed to be such a precarious and ineffectual thing  Lovel  As to myself  proceeds he  I hope I have a great deal of time before me since I intend  one day  to be a reformed man  Lovelace lived not to repent  I have very serious reflections nowandthen yet am I afraid of what I was once told that a man cannot repent when he will Not to hold it I suppose is meantI have repented by fits and starts a thousand times  Lovel  Laugh at me if thou wilt  says Belford  but never never more will I take the liberties I have done but whenever I am tempted think of Belton's dying agonies and what my own may be  The most hopeful time for Repentance is when the health is sound when the intellects are untouched and while it is in a person's power to make some reparation to the injured or misled  Reparation should always follow Repentance  That Repentance which precedes the suffering that follows a wrong step must generally be wellgrounded and happy  Repentance to such as have lived only carelesly and in the omission of their regular duties is not so easy a task nor so much in their power as some imagine  No false colouring no glosses does a truly penitent man aim at    See  Remorse Religion  Reprehension Reproof Correction  THE Reproof that favours more of the cautioning friend than of the satirizing observer always calls for gratitude  Reproofs to be efficacious should be mild gentle and unreproaching  How much more eligible is it to be corrected by a real friend than by continuing either blind or wilful to expose one's self to the censure of an envious and perhaps malignant world  The correction that is unseasonably given is more likely to harden or make an hypocrite than to reclaim  A bad man reprehends a bad man with a very ill grace  Persons reprehending others should take care that altho' they may not be guilty of the faults they condemn they are not guilty of others as great  The benevolence of our purpose should be very apparently seen in all our Reprehensions  See  Censure  Reputation  THE man who is careless of his Reputation must be so either from an abandon'd nature or from a consciousness that he deserves not the world's good opinion  It is just that a man should bear to be evilspoken of who sets no value upon his Reputation  The man who has been always chary of his Reputation has an excellent security to give to a woman for his good behaviour to her    See  Men and Women  Resentment  PErsons who have carried their resentments too high are not easily brought to retract or forgive  If an injury be not wilfully done or avow'd to be so there can be no room for lasting Resentment  The man who would resent as the highest indignity the imputation of a wilful falshood ought surely to be above the guilt of one  The presence even of a disliked person takes off the edge of Resentments which absence frequently whets and makes keen  Women who when treated with indecency have nothing to reproach themselves with may properly resent  Resentment and revenge ought ever to be separated  That Resentment which is express'd with calmness and without passion is most likely to last  Passion refuses the aid of expression sometimes where the Resentment  prima facie  declares expression to be needless    See  Anger Passion Revenge  Respect Reverence  PErsons who deserve Respect will meet with it without needing to require it  Persons who would exact Respect by an haughty behaviour give a proof that they mistrust their own merit and seem to confess that they  know  their actions will not attract it  Familiarity destroys Reverence but not with the prudent the grateful and the generous  Persons in years expect the Reverence due to their years yet many of them having not merit are ashamed of the years which can only intitle them to Reverence  A studied Respectfulness or complaisance is always to be suspected  Even a wicked man will revere a woman that will withstand his lewd attempts  It shall ever be a rule with me  says Miss Howe  that he that does not regard a woman with some degree of Reverence will look upon her and sometimes treat her with contempt    See  Advice to Women Courtship Love Men and Women  Revenge  REvenge grafted upon disappointed Love is generally the most violent of all our passions  The highest Revenge a low female spirit can take is to prevent her rival's having the man she loves and procuring her to be obliged to marry the man she hates  Even the ties of relationship in such a case lose all their force  Revenge will not wipe off guilt  What Revenge can be more effectual and more noble than a generous and well distinguished forgiveness  See  Resentment  Satire  TRUE Satire must be founded in goodnature and directed by a right heart  When Satire is personal and aims to expose rather than to amend the subject of it how tho' it were to be  just  could it be useful  Friendly Satire may be

become public in the pride of shewing either their consequence or sagacity  Health and spirits  but not discretion or decency  allow busy people to look out of themselves into the affairs of others  Secrets to the prejudice of the innocent ought not to be kept  There may be occasions where a breach of confidence is more excuseable than to keep the Secret  Lovel  I believe I should have kill'd thee at the time if I could  says Lovelace to Belford  hadst thou betray'd me to my Fairone But I am sure  now  that I would have thank'd thee for preventing my baseness to her and thought thee more a

Selfish  A man's own interest or convenience is a poor plea if there be no better on which to found expectations of favour from another  The address which is persisted in against the undoubted inclination of the beloved object is too selfish to be encouraged  What a low selfish creature must that child be who is to be rein'din only by the hope of what a parent can or will do for her  The selfish heart never wants an excuse for not doing the  good  it has no inclination to do  It is very low and selfish to form our judgments of the general merits of others as they are kind or reserved to ourselves  There must be great Selfishness and meanness in the love of a man who can wish a young creature to sacrifice her duty and conscience to oblige him  The man who has no other plea for a woman's favour but that of his loving her builds only on a compliment made to her Selflove by his own Selfishness  To serve one's self and punish a villain at the same time is serving both public and pr  e  Lovel  Selflove will mo  t probably give those who advise with us on their most intimate concerns an interest in our hearts whether they deserve it or not  Self is a grandmisleader  That man or

loath what we once lov'd  When sickness comes free livers look round them and upon one another like frighted birds at the sight of a kite just ready to souse upon them  Sickness enervates the mind as

person to enjoy the present without being overanxious about the future  A thoughtful woman who has given her lover an undue power over her will be apt to behold him with fear and look upon herself

person who is vain of  exterior  advantages gives cause to doubt his  interior    The outside of a vain man generally runs away with him  Some persons are not able to forego the ostentation of sagacity tho' they sacrifice to it the tenderness due to friendship and charity  Men who have a Conceit of their own volubility love to find ears to exert their talents upon  Men of parts may perhaps think they have a privilege to be vain yet they have the least occasion of any to be so since the world is ready to find them out and extol them  The man who is disposed immoderately to exalt himself must despise everybody else in proportion  The man who in conversation takes  knowingly  the wrong side of an argument shews Vanity in the high compliment he pays to his own abilities  Men vain of their learning and acquirements parading with one another before the other Sex may probably have women present who tho' sitting in smiling silence may rather despise than admire them  The man who wants to be thought wiser or better or abler than he is does but provoke a scrutiny into his pretensions which seldom ends to his advantage  He that exalts himself insults his neighbours who are then provoked to question even the merit which otherwise might have been allow'd to be his due  A too great consciousness of superiority often brings on contempt  Old bachelors when they like a woman frequently think they have nothing to do but to  persuade themselves  to marry  Affectation  will make a woman seem not to understand indecent freedoms of speech in men but modesty if the freedoms are gross will make her resent them  It is generally the conscious overfulness of Vanity or Conceit that makes the vain man most upon his guard to conceal his Vanity  Lovel  Opinionative women are in danger when they meet with a man who will magnify their wisdom in order to take advantage of their folly  Lovel  Selfsufficiency makes a weak person the fittest of all others for the artful and

Curser punish as he speaks he would be a fiend  The Almighty gives not his assent to rash and inhuman Curses  To pray for those that curse us is to perform a duty and thereby to turn a Curse into a

Romancewriters often put a youthful mind upon the scent for an object to exert its fancy upon  In other words  Often create beauty and place it where nobody else can find it  Romancewriters never forget to give their Heroine a Cleanthe a Violetta a Clelia or some such prettynamed confidante an old nurse at least to help them out at a dead lift  Unnatural similies drawn by poetical lovers to illustrate beauty rather depreciate than exalt it  A person may not be a bad critic tho' not himself a very excellent Writer  Our poets  Mr Belford says  hardly know how to create a distress without horror murder and suicide and think they must shock your souls to bring tears from your eyes  Female words tho' of uncertain derivation have generally very significant meanings  Early familiar Letterwriting is one of the greatest openers and improvers of the mind that man or woman can be employed in  It is to be lamented that many eminent Writers who are capable of exalting virtue and of putting vice out of countenance throw away their time upon subjects merely speculative disinteresting and unedifying  The ingenious authors of pieces of a light or indecent turn which have a tendency to corrupt the morals of youth to convey polluted images or to wound religion are dishonest to their own talents and ungrateful to the God who gave them those talents  Youth  Little inducement has an headstrong Youth to correct a temper which gives him consequence at home  Young persons should be careful in giving advice to a young friend in cases where passion and prudence are concerned  Young persons whose minds are not engaged by acts of kindness and condescension will be put upon contrivances  Youth is the time of life for imagination or fancy to work in A Writer therefore who would wish to please a judicious eye will lay by his works written at that time till experience shall direct the fire to glow rather than blaze out  Youth not qualified to judge for itself it often above advice  Young folks are sometimes very cunning in finding out contrivances to cheat themselves  It is a most improving exercise as well with regard to style as to morals to accustom ourselves early to write down everything of moment that befals us  There is not so much bravery in youthful choler as young men imagine  In company where there are strangers it is right for young gentlemen who would wish to be thought well of to hear every one speak before they allow themselves to talk    See  Duty Education Learning Wit Writers  TABLE TO THE PRECEDING SENTIMENTS  A  ADversity Affliction Calamity
