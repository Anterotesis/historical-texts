Ireton  S  r  Tho Fairfax  Robert Devereux  Earl of Pembroke  MEMOIRS AND REFLECTIONS UPON THE REIGN and GOVERNMENT OF King  CHARLES  the I  st  AND K  CHARLES  the II  d  Containing an ACCOUNT of several remarka∣ble Facts not mentioned by other Historians of those Times Wherein the Character of the ROYAL MARTYR and of King CHARLES II are Vindicated from Fanatical Aspersions  Written by Sir RICHARD BULSTRODE Resident at  Brussels  to the Court of  Spain  from King CHARLES II and Envoy from King JAMES II till the Revolution  Now First Published from his Original MANUSCRIPT  LONDON  Printed by  N MIST  for  Charles Rivington  at the  Bible  and  Crown  in St  Paul  s Churchyard  TO THE READER  W  HEN the Posthumous Pieces of any Author have for some Years lain in Obscurity and at last come into the World the Publisher for his own Reputation is obliged to satisfy the Publick that they are the genuine Productions of that Pen to which his Title Page pretends to ascribe them  THAT these MEMOIRS may fall un∣der no Suspicions of being spurious it is necessary that I should account for  their coming into my Possession When I was last Year in  Paris  it was my good Fortune to contract some Acquain∣tance with a younger Son of Sir  Richard Bulstrode  who then resided there as Governour in the Family of the young Earl of  Fingal  I had not long enjoy'd the Honour of his Conversation before he frankly gave me the Copy of these MEMOIRS with free Liberty to make them publick to the World and assured me they were all wrote by the Hand of Sir  Richard  his Father The Town is therefore indebted to this Gentleman's Generosity and are to look upon me as an Agent that labours to be faithful in acquitting my self of a Charge intrusted to me  I SHOULD have thought it a neces∣sary Piece of Justice to have made a Character of Sir  Richard Bulstrode  a Part of this Preface but find all that is re∣quisite on this Head is already done by  Whitlock Bulstrode  Esq  likewise a Son of the Author and who has obliged the Publick with a Volume of his Father's  Essays Printed in  Octavo  in the Year where the Reader may be enter∣tained with a preliminary Account how well Sir  Richard  was qualify'd both for an Author and Statesman  IF these Sheets could stand in need of any other Proof of their being ge∣nuine than the Assertion I have given from whose Hands I received them I could not desire a stronger concurring Testimony than those Essays Every Judge who will do himself the Plea∣sure of a Comparison will find both those and the MEMOIRS penn'd in the same Style and with the same Cast of Thought and Spirit of Language The Contents being Matter of Fact they should neither be partial nor of a Par∣ty yet if some will think he reflects too severely let them consider he wrote at a Time when Faction and Presbytery had undone his Royal Master and left a very poor Prospect of the Kingdom it self escaping from their Rancour  Nath Mist  AN Alphabetical Index

streightened with Fears to run for Shelter to what their Fancy presents as an Instru∣ment of their Ease and Reme∣dy but he that hath Time to deliberate unless he places his Hopes upon something that is like to ease his Pain by making his Afflictions less or his Pa∣tience  more deserves that Misery he groans under But Afflictions which come by God's Appointment represent the Sadness of Morta∣lity and become Monuments of Mens Piety and Devotion In the unnatural War which the Subjects of King  Charles  I began against their most lawful Sovereign contrary to all Solemnies of Christianity and of all that is called Good I was then very young and in a Labyrinth not knowing well which Way to go but at last I resolved to go to  Whitehall  with some Gentlemen of the  InnerTemple  be∣ing then newly come thither from  Cambridge  where I had been bred in  PembrokeHall  I was brought up to  London  by my Father from  Coventry  where we then dwelt We were all brought into the King's Presence by the Lord Chamberlain and had the Honour to kiss the King's Hands who took our Coming very kind∣ly and at the same time told us he hoped he should have no need of our Service  About this Time the King and the Laws who by God and Man respectively are appoin∣ted the sole Protectors of Innocence and Truth had themselves I thought the greatest need of a Protector and when I consider'd our King's Case in the Beginning of his Troubles methought it was much like to that of King  David  who was vexed with a Civil War both by his Son  Absalom  and by his own People But the Case of our King was worse than that of King  David  for the Text says his Enemies kept about him  like Bees  and were extinct there was  some Honey with them but our King's Ene∣mies came about him like Hornets where there was all Sting and no Honey And indeed the King's Case was rather like that of  Isaac  ready to be sacrificed the Wood was prepared the Fire kindled the Knife was lift up and the Hand was striking and if the King's loyal Sub∣jects had not been something like  Abraham  too having out of Hope believed in Hope we had been as much without Comfort as we were in outward Appearance without Remedy Indeed I then saw such unparallel'd Revolutions in our  English  Monarchy as I hope will never be imi∣tated and will be scarce credited in AfterAges whereupon I have thought it worth my Time to give some Account of those great and strange Transactions wherein I was personally engag'd which are still fresh in my Memory having faithfully served King  Charles  I from the Year which Civil War ended not till in the most deplorable Murder of the best of Kings whose Cause at last God so owned and so vindicated his Honour that never Prince was more truly lamented nor his Posterity by divine Providence more wonderfully reesta∣blished without the Assistance of any foreign Power tho' his rebellious Subjects used all possible Diligence which either Wit or Malice could invent to extirpate the Royal Family both Root and Branch  I presume the Duty of my publick Employ∣ments abroad under King  Charles  II and King  James  II will in some Measure plead my Excuse  for giving some Relations of the War of King  Charles  I which have not yet been mention'd and of those sudden Changes and violent Re∣volutions happen'd in the last Age and being now grown old to all worldly Pleasures after many long and faithful Services to the Crown and being wholly unacquainted with the Know∣ledge of Riches or with the Cares of increasing them or the Fears of losing them and finding little Taste in common Conversation I have spent my latter Years in writing some Memoirs Poems and other Discourses to shew that I have not spent my last Days in Idleness and Vanity and that since I can no longer live in an active Life I may not die an unprofitable Servant And yet I have but small Inclination to write when the Number of Scribblers in this last Age hath given the World a Surfeit by the mischievous Liberty of Writing where∣by great Advantage hath been taken to corrupt People with false Notions of Government which hath destroyed Millions of Men by engaging them in such a Rebellion as no Age or Nation can equal under Pretence of Reli∣gion and Law And tho' at first it did not break out into Blood but was carried on for some time with Paper Skirmishes yet at last it grew too strong for both and according to the usual Practice when any Rebellion was hatch∣ing they that designed it immediately cry'd out  Hannibal ad Portas  and that what they did was to preserve their Religion Laws Li∣berties and Properties when none of them were  in Danger and when they most flattered their Sovereign and called God to witness the Purity of their Intentions even then they were prepa∣ring their Weapons to murder him And as it is seen in natural Bodies that Fatness of Diet doth for the most Part lay the Foundation of Maladies which cannot be expell'd by the most skillful Physician without the Use of some ex∣traordinary Medicines so in our Body Poli∣tick we were bless'd with long Peace with Riches and Plenty the Product of it and by the propitious Influence of our King when we thus flourished we went only to throw away those blessed Fruits of Peace so that the whole Body Politick was quickly out of Order And tho' perhaps there were some Errors and Irre∣gularities in the Government yet they pro∣ceeded not from any Pravity of Disposition in the King nor from any Principles of Arbitrary Government it being confessed by the King's greatest Enemies that he was indued with the best and purest Morals of any Prince that ever held the  English  Scepter But his People thought that some evil Counsellours did capti∣vate him at their Pleasure and did thrust his Majesty into Actions prejudicial to himself and the common Good upon which they were in∣vited by that rebellious Parliament to take Arms under the plausible Shew of Reformation and Liberty when many of them in the Simplici∣ty of their Hearts never had the least Intenti∣on of abridging the King of any of his just Pre∣rogative but only to restrain some Excesses in  Government which they really thought were the Excrescences of sovereign Power and were rather Burthens than Ornaments of his royal Diadem Indeed his very Example would have had a greater Influence upon his Subjects than the strictest Laws He was so great a Lover of Justice and so great a Justiciar himself that no Temptations could dispose him to a wrongful Action unless it were so disguised to him that he believed it to be just and yet I cannot but confess that a Prince's Fame in this World depends more upon his wise Administration than upon his private Morality and good Life The Goodness of his Government depends chiefly upon those that advise him who are to yield unto their Prince all the Reputation ari∣sing from their good Counsels and never to in∣tercept the Honour of them from the King It being an infallible Maxim That he is not the worst King that is the worst Man but he who hath the worst Counsellours and Instruments under him  The Laws of  England  making them the on∣ly Persons obnoxious to be arraigned and puni∣shed being in the King's Confidence and in the Head of his Affairs these should have been pitched upon to answer criminally for all those things which were then called Miscarriages the Law having mark'd them out as Offenders and as Offerings of Attonement for the King's Faults were he guilty of any but instead of this the King whom all the Laws of the Land and the Constitution it self hold not only un∣punishable  but innocent was elected as the ScapeGoat to have the Offences of his Mini∣sters and the subordinate Tools of the Govern∣ment transmitted and laid upon him  Thus Rebels are never without some Pretext to palliate their Actions and rather than fail will make their Vizard of Religion which if true is a Setler not a Stickler in Government She confirms Men in Obedience and does not en∣courage them in Rebellion It is a great Mi∣stake indeed to think Peace is well enough preserved if the Sword be not drawn and think it not War because we do not take the Field whereas we may as well call it Health when there is a dangerous Fermentation in the Blood because the Patient hath not taken his Bed For certainly where there is not a firm Trust between the King and his People from a due Obedience to his Laws and Government and a steady Care not to remove the ancient Landmarks not to disturb those Constitutions which the Wisdom of our Ancestors hath set∣led in order to preserve the whole Frame of the Government upon the old Foundations When any of these fail the Kingdom must needs fall into Confusion as was miserably seen in the Time of this unhappy Prince  But to find the Beginning of these Evils we must look back as far as Queen  Elizabeth  where we shall discover the Presbyterians con∣triving what they have since put in Execution to the eternal Scandal of the  English  Nation Their Religion hath always been imperious  turbulent and bloody and hath embroil'd all Places with Rebellion where it once got Foot∣ing from its first Rise at  Geneva  to its Re∣move into  France  from thence into  Holland  so into  Scotland  and from thence to its Arrival in  England  They are impatient of any kind of Government Theocracy it self would not please them for they conclude against all Governments From their first Institution they shewed their Hatred against Monarchs and they still glory to have had a principal Part in most of the Commotions of Christendom since they took up the Work of Reformation and by their frequent Insurrections in  England  they gave the first Occasion of saying  Rex Angliae Rex Diabolorum  The rest of Schismaticks are but their Spawn  Calvin  first founded his Presbytery and Treason For when they at  Geneva  had in his Absence expell'd their lawful Prince he not only encourag'd but confirm'd what they had done at his Return Presbytery never was received into any State where it did not embroil never any Man was possessed with it whom it did not strangely transform with Moroseness all their Writings are stuff'd with reproachful Language against the sacred Persons of Princes with Dethroning Principles and Kingkilling Doctrines as may be seen in  Calvin  's  Institutions  in that of  Junius Brutus  in  Vindiciae contra Tyrannos  written by  Beza  and  Knox  's  Appellation to the People  and  Buchanan  's  Jus Regni apud Scotos  which he had the Impudence to dedicate to King  James    in which Book and others of their Writings they say The People are the Original of all just Power and that wicked Kings for their Misgovernment may be put to Death by their Subjects An impious Principle justly con∣demn'd and fitted only for the Mouth of a  Ravilliac  History tells us that in the Reigns of Queen  Elizabeth  King  James  and King  Charles  I the Presbyterians were always grum∣bling and murmuring against the Times their whole Practice being to deprive God of his Glory the Prince of his Honour and the Peo∣ple of their Senses affirming the Condition of  England  was miserable In the Beginning of Queen  Elizabeth  the Pulse of the People began to beat high by the Instigation of the Presby∣terians towards an Aristocratical Government under a Kingly Title and the malicious Ene∣mies of the Church and State did then begin to appear but that watchful Queen was soon alar∣med and so asserted her Prerogative that she kept all in their Duty She declared and pro∣tested publickly that no Trouble should arrive to the  Roman  Catholicks for any Difference in Religion which did much abate the Opposition which might possibly have been made by them hoping for fair Quarter under her Government She knew well that a King or Queen of  Eng∣land  how sovereign soever could not establish a new Religion in their Kingdom without the Authority and Countenance of a Parliament and therefore to win the Bishops and the rest of the  Roman  Catholicks in Parliament at  least to Obedience she was content to use Poli∣cy with them and would qualify the Style of Supreme Head of the Church and State to that of Supreme Governour which tho' it al∣ter'd not the Sense yet it abused many into a Belief or Conceit that the Queen pretended not so much Primacy Ecclesiastick as the King her Father had done who was the first King of  England  that ever gave Cause to try the ad∣mirable Patience and Obedience of his Catho∣lick Subjects who took not Arms against their Sovereign and had no other Weapons but  Praeces Lachrymae  the Prayers and Tears of the Church for their Refuge  Indeed Queen  Elizabeth  was so careful that the Parliament could make no Impression upon her Sovereignty and tho' the Cry of Persecu∣tion was pretty loud and that the Enemies of Church and State were troublesome to her yet by her constant Resolution she was not over∣borne by any Faction and finding it easier to crop them in the Bud than to pull them up by the Roots she took the right Course with them by putting the Schismaticks under the Statute of Recusancy equal with the  Roman  Catholicks whereby she quieted All and often declared in Parliament That both Houses had only Au∣thority to advise and consent to what they thought was for the common Good and Benefit of her Subjects And wherever the Prince is not jealous of Underminers and active to pre∣serve the establish'd Government there will never want Spirits to attempt a Change and  make Religion a Shelter for their Rebellion It is certain the  English  have always loved those Princes best who grounded their Power in the Affections of their People who ruled them by their old Laws and used such moderate Power as was consistent with their Government rather than such as aim'd at any Change which might tend to subvert their ancient Constitution and seldom any Prince hath miscarried who con∣stantly pursued the publick Good and directed all his Counsels to his Country's Ease but those Princes have been full of disastrous Troubles who have obstinately adhered to a Few against the Whole and have conferred that Affection to particular Persons which should be exten∣ded to the universal Body of the People  The Truth is the Excellency of Queen  Eli∣zabeth  's Government was that at her first Coming to the Crown she found a Council of able Ministers which in the last Age were not seen which she continued who managed the publick Affairs with such prudent Conduct that their Counsels and Actions as they were either Gown or Sword Men gave great Satisfaction and had great Influence upon the whole Nation But her Successor King  James  was not so wary who came to the Crown under many Difficulties for the Mixture of a Stranger Nation formerly upon no good Terms with  England  the Subjection of it to a Stranger Prince whose Nature and Disposition being unknown could not but prove of very ill Con∣sequence who let that ill Humour in the Peo∣ple  imbibe so fast that it soon bred in them a violent Contumacy against the Prerogative And this King  James  minding his Pleasures more than his Business his Favourites were more esteemed than his Statesmen who there∣upon permitted his Favourite  Scotchmen  coming out of a poor mountainous Country into a rich Soil to make a Harvest of the Crown Reve∣nue and when handsom Mr  Villiers  was brought into Favour for Handsomness went a great Way in our Court he came suddenly to have so prodigious an Ascent upon the King that he entirely disposed of all his Favours and did whatever he pleas'd  In the Beginning of this King's Government the King had no great Choice of excellent Men and Mr  Villiers  's Ascent was so quick that it seem'd rather a Flight than a Growth and he was such a Darling of Fortune as if he had been born a Favourite being Supreme the first Month he came to Court However he was very unfortunate in the Election of his Depen∣dants few of his Servants being qualified enough to advise him and were intent only of grow∣ing rich under him and not upon their Ma∣ster's being as Good as Great And if this great Favourite had been so happy as to have had but one faithful Friend that Person might have done great Service to both his Masters even to Father and Son In King  James  the Father's Time he took the Prince of  Wales  into  Spain  contrary to the King's Opinion who yet submitted to him and upon a particular  Discontent of his own broke the intended Marriage and brought back the Prince to the great Satisfaction both of King and People which Action was so highly approved in the last Parliament of that King that the Duke of  Bucks  was called The Saviour of the People and the Earl of  Bristol  then Ambassador at  Madrid  was recalled and Articles exhibited against him by the Duke and by his Interest was kept out of the House of Lords Now all that happen'd in  Spain  is here very well worth relating which I have had from a very sure Hand which hath been kept private from many  The Earl of  Bristol  was employ'd Ambassador in  Spain  by King  James  to treat of the Marri∣age with the then  Infanta  of  Spain  The King of  Spain  being zealous for the  Roman  Catholick Religion insisted to procure some Favours for the  English Roman  Catholicks which related no farther than to a Freedom of Religion for the  Infanta  her Servants and the Children of the Marriage and her Ecclesiasticks and Reli∣gious which could not be done without the King's particular Licence and Dispensation to which the King assented But this Affair being longer delayed the  Spanish  King urged farther in Favour of the  English Roman  Catholicks in general but the Manner and Way of doing it was to be left to his Majesty's Wisdom Where∣upon King  James  and Prince  Charles  both signed and King  James  for farther Satisfaction did by the Lord  Conway  his then Secretary of State dated  Aug  declare and engage  That his said Majesty would cause a present Suspension under the Great Seal of  England  of all those penal Laws whereunto his  Roman  Catholick Subjects were before subject and under the same Great Seal would give a Dispen∣sation and Toleration to all his  Roman  Catho∣lick Subjects as well Priests as temporal Per∣sons The Marriage not taking Effect and Animosities happening betwixt the Duke of  Buckingham  and the Earl of  Bristol  the Earl before King  James  's Death having been impea∣ched in Parliament yet he wrought so with the House of Commons as to impeach the Duke who then prevailed with his present Majesty that the Impeachment of the Earl should be first try'd in the same Parliament thereby to cause the Earl to forbear Prosecution of his Charge against the Duke or to invalidate his Testimony One of the Articles charged against the Earl of  Bristol  was  That he counselled and perswaded King  James  to grant and allow the Papists free Toleration and silencing all Laws made against them  But the Earl positively de∣nied this Article and said it was only decla∣red  That he would dispense with the Laws which imported no more than a Permission to ex∣ercise their Religion in private Houses and to suspend the Execution of the Laws against them for a time all which the King had Power to do  But to grant a free Toleration imports an Al∣lowance of publick Worship and the silencing all Laws against them might import a total Repeal  which the King did not claim a Right  to do himself  When the Impeachment was brought into the Lords House the Earl of  Bristol  did put in his Answer to it and posi∣tively denied that he had counselled any thing in the Matter charged and declared fully what was done and what was signed by the late King  James  and King  Charles  as also the Decla∣ration made by the Lord  Conway  by the King's Order and added  That the Duke of  Buckin∣gham  being then the greatest Minister of State and Favourite to King  James  did advise all things in the Affair That the Lord  Conway  certainly signed the Declaration  The Earl wanted neither Wit nor Courage to charge the Duke with Crimes as distasteful as he could find any and he spared not the Lord  Conway  who was the Duke's Friend and must have been the best Witness to save the Duke in case the Charge had been prosecuted The Parliament then sit∣ting was as diligent to enquire into Misde∣meanours as much displeased with the Duke and as little fond of the Lord  Conway  then Secretary of State and were as much enclined to enquire into the too much advancing or stretching the King's Prerogative to the Preju∣dice of the Subject and against the Laws as any Parliament which ever sat in  England Yet neither did the Parliament or the Earl of  Bri∣stol  charge any thing against the Duke or the Lord  Conway  for advising to dispense with Pe∣nal Laws nor did the Parliament prosecute the Earl of  Bristol  upon the Impeachment against him  tho' he was thereby particularly charged  for advising the King to dispense with the Penal Laws  Now if King  James  and King  Charles I  did pass any Act of Parliament as some affirm to bar themselves or the Crown of this Right the same could be only intended as to the ordi∣nary Exercise of that Right  but not to the ex∣traordinary where the publick Good requires the same should be exercised The King's Pro∣ceedings were to be thus intended and not otherwise which was proved by the King's continual Exercise of that Power in the Suspen∣sion of Penal Laws never questioned or com∣plained of but still submitted unto and admit∣ted as legal  as namely those touching the Im∣portation of  French  Wines  And it was clear by his Majesty's Practice for many Years that he thought it both reasonable and legal to con∣tinue the Dispensations by which his Majesty suspended many Laws without any Oppo∣sition  About this Time a War was declared with  Spain  which was carried on by the violent Humour of the Duke whose Power was so great that he govern'd all without a Rival which Preheminence he managed very unthrif∣tily disposing of all Places to his own Relati∣ons where there was no Advantage or Profit to be had  This Partiality shewed the Duke's Weakness and was much unbecoming the Great∣ness of the King his Master whose Honour should shine upon the whole Body of his People as the Sun sheds his Influence warming all Parts of the Earth  And where Kings shew them∣selves  partial to a Party they are usually served by the worst of the People and are often forced to protect the Bad against the Good as we have often seen in our late Revolutions Not that Subjects repine that Princes should have Friends with whom they may communicate their Thoughts and unbend their Cares nor to see such better'd by their Favours which is warranted by the Example of the best of Kings who must sometimes recreate themselves and not be always upon their Thrones which would too much weary them Greatness must be set aside sometimes the better to be relished But Subjects do behold with Indignation Men to be exalted who abuse their Prince's Favours and by false Representations traduce all others that they may ingross the Prince to themselves with∣out Regard to the King's Honour when their par∣ticular Advantage or Safety is in Question Such Ministers are generally hated and the People commonly reach their Heads at last Wise Prin∣ces should never protect such Ministers for when Princes bring Projectors into the Administration of their Affairs who are Inventers of new Taxes they bring an Odium upon their Master and the Ignorance of such Men brings more Necessities upon the Prince than their Arts of raising Mo∣ney can supply None but wanting Princes employ such Men who sometimes can skin over a Sore which after breaks out with greater Rancour Whereas wise Statesmen would by wholesom Counsel obviate the Danger in its Growth and restrain their King's extravagant  Bounty before he hath nothing left to give For the Bounty of a Prince often frights Men from meddling in their Affairs I know Li∣berality is counted the proper Virtue of a Prince it being much better for him to be pro∣fuse than avaritious Prodigality having the Resemblance of something more noble than Avarice and really it is less odious and they that gain by it make it pass for a Virtue but perhaps it is more prejudicial to Posterity and no less dangerous than the other Extreme For if a King give away his whole Kingdom he cannot satisfy all that ask no nor all that think they deserve much from him It is then more convenient to give with Reason and ne∣ver to draw so near the Bottom but that Princes may always have wherewith to gratify Persons of Merit and above all they should take espe∣cial Care that their Liberality be exercised without Oppression of their People to avoid Murmuring which may produce Rebellion Wise Kings should never give till their Coffers are full for the Measures of Bounty ought to be taken from the Plenty of the Giver as well as the Merit of the Receiver And Kings seldom hurt themselves by giving what is actually in their Keeping for Reward of particular Merit but giving things they never had as King  James  I actually did to his Favourites of which they know not the Value is the Ruin of Princes Treasure and consequently of their Affairs For the Necessities of wanting Princes make them repeat Taxes which loses them the  Affection of their Subjects and Thrift hath ever been esteemed a Point of good Wisdom in Kings who should stand firm against all parti∣cular Suits so that no Case upon what Grace soever may break the Rule for if one strong Sheep breaks the Hedge a Hundred little ones will follow And therefore the first thing a King should learn to say is  No  and that so re∣solutely as never to be asked twice nor once importunately For one extravagant Gift to one raises the Market to every Man else and the unlimited Bounty of a wanting Prince makes him a Beggar tho' he have a vast Reve∣nue And that Prince who will give more to Importunity than Merit may as reasonably forbid his Subjects doing well upon Penalty of being undone by it Where Princes give be∣cause they are importun'd and where the less useful Part of the People have most Credit with their King this shews the Way to get every thing is to be good for nothing and tho' the servile Part of Mankind are apt to extol not only generous Princes but those that are pro∣fuse yet if we consider the Story of the  Roman  Empire we shall find their Decadence took its Rise principally from this profuse Temper and that their Prodigality drove them to Want and made them oppress and become odious to their People by their frequent Taxes But we need not now make Laws against giving too much Princes are not so free in this Age and we want no Overseer of that kind in our Court at  St Germaine  's where we live upon Alms  The good Emperor  Marcus Aurelius Antoni∣nus  in his Nature very bountiful having given the People a larger Donative than usual was yet so frugal of the publick Money that upon an Expedition against the  Scythians  he would not draw any Sum from the Treasury without first asking Leave of the Senate affirming that he had nothing in particular and not so much as the House he lived in And being another Time pressed by his Army for a Donative after a signal Victory he refused it saying  The more I give the young Soldiers the more I must oppress their Parents  And therefore the  Romans  well answer'd one of their Emperors demanding double Taxes  O Emperor if thou wilt have double Taxes we must have double Harvests  Kings are Fathers of their Country but unless they keep their own Estates they are such Fathers as the Sons maintain which is against the Order of Nature and the less a Father depends upon his Children the more he is certainly respected  The Love of Subjects is not obtained by Mo∣ney but by wise Government and good Con∣duct and all People even Soldiers reverence their Prince more who keeps something in his Power to give than he who gives all away Ex∣pectation and Hope carrying Men farther than the Sense of past or present Benefits and good Princes desire to make their People easy King  Charles  I of  England  never refused to ease his People of any Grievance and passed more Acts of Grace for the Benefit of his Subjects than  any five Kings or Queens had done before him He granted an Act of Triennial Parliament and the perpetuating of them was an Act unparal∣lel'd by any of his Predecessors And good Sub∣jects should never think it just that the King's Condition should be worse by bettering theirs But our good King counted himself undimini∣shed by his largest Concessions thinking by them to gain the Love of his People being perswaded he could not grant too much nor distrust too little to Men that being professed∣ly his Subjects pretended singular Piety and religious Strictness But our King was much mistaken for no Fountain of Royal Bounty was able to satisfy their  Corban  of Religion And it is sure had that good King yielded less he had been opposed less and had he denied more he had been more obeyed Princes should therefore take Care of running with the Stream for chusing a crooked Course for fear of the Torrent is not commonly very dangerous  The Honour of a King consists chiefly in doing good to the universal Body of his People which good  Charles  aim'd at there being no∣thing so glorious for a Prince as to let his Peo∣ple enjoy Ease and Plenty and not to enrich a few Persons with the Spoils of a whole Coun∣try  Henry  IV of  France  said he hoped so to order Matters that every Man in his Kingdom might have a boil'd Capon for his Dinner Cer∣tainly no Apothegm so much by the Ancients commended could so well become the Mouth  of a great King as this wellnatur'd Saying and it is probable had he lived he would have made good his Word which would have been a more durable Triumph to his Fame than all his great Victories and his Example who by his Frugality brought the Crown of  France  out of Debt is to be preferred to that of  Henry  III of  France  who harassed his whole Kingdom to build up four or five great Fami∣lies whereby he left behind him so many con∣spicuous Monuments of his Folly and Weak∣ness And our King  James  I followed the Measures of  Henry  III in his most extravagant Bounties which caused the then Lord Treasu∣rer to put upon a long Table where the King was to pass by that Morning a large Sum of Money in Silver which the King had given to one of his Favourites the Night before The King being much surprized with the Sight having never seen so much Money before to∣gether asked the Treasurer who was behind him what that Money was for who said it was for such a Person naming him to whom the King had given it To which the King presently replied with his usual Oath it was much more than any Man could deserve from him and commanded the Treasurer to pay him only one Quarter of it This made the King more careful of his future Bounties tho' I may truly say that this King tho' to his own Pre∣judice had more Compassion of other Mens Necessities than of his own Coffers for in Li∣berality he exceeded by many Degrees all the  Kings that ever went before him And it had been much better for King  Charles  his Succes∣sor if his Liberality had not been so great for by that means he left his Successor much indebted which prov'd infinitely prejudicial both to the King and Kingdom  Now whosoever hath read King  James  's Works will find therein most rational and po∣litick Discourses of the Nature of Government and the good Temper of the  English  Monarchy where there is no unnatural Swelling of Power nor Liberty for these two are like Heat and Moisture where they are well mix'd every thing prospers but where they are single they are destructive and our true lawful Govern∣ment in  England  is like our Climate where there are sometimes unquiet loud Winds which tho' troublesome yet they clear the Air and much of Mens Healths is owing to them Ab∣solute Power is a Plant that will not grow up∣on  English  Ground those who have attempted to cultivate it in that Soil have hastned their own Ruine All Men must confess that King  James  's Discourses in Parliaments were admira∣ble but the practical Part was wanting for his remiss and loose Government was a great Cause of our following Disorders For finding no Money could be raised to supply his Necessi∣ties and extravagant Bounties but by Parlia∣ment he therefore still caressed them thinking that Way to prevent the ill Humour which lay in the Stomach of the Nation which then be∣gan to shew it self more publickly and he  would often say he was but One King that in his House of Commons were near Five Hun∣dred and whilst he liv'd in  Scotland  his Presbyterian Subjects so much teazed and so often imprisoned him that he had as good al∣most been one of the Kings of  Brentford  as King of  Scotland  However this King con∣tented with those Dominions which he had by an undisputed Succession coveted nothing more from his Neighbours nor had other Thoughts or Wishes besides those of the common Peace and Repose of Christendom and had therefore a just Motto given to his Arms  Beati Pacifici  He had so much Cunning that he still held well with his Parliaments and desired to be beloved rather than feared by them For Pow∣er without Love hath a terrifying Aspect and the Worship paid to it is like that which the  Indians  give out of Fear to wild Beasts and Devils And as he that fears God only because he is Almighty wishes there was no God so he that fears the King only because he can punish wishes there was no King and therefore a King cannot take too much Care to keep himself up For if a King lets his People slip from him he is no longer really their King but the People may let a King fall and still re∣main a People  In this Conjuncture after Twenty Two Years peaceably reigning in  England  King  James  I died leaving his Son then King  Charles  his Successor ingag'd in a War with  Spain  by Ad∣vice of Parliament without Supplies to sup∣port  it and left his own Debts great by his immoderate Bounty to which a great Addition was made upon King  Charles  's coming first to the Crown and many Inconveniencies were then submitted to for Supply contrary to for∣mer Laws and Miscarriages in Government escaped in the Beginning of this King's Reign which happened thro' the ill Counsel of some Men driving on their own private Ends and the Peevishness of some others envying the Publick should be managed without them join'd with the insuperable Necessities of State rather than from any Propensity in the King who was free from any Injuriousness or Op∣pression of his People  The Duke of  Buckingham  was at this time received into an admired Intimacy and Dearness by the King and a Marriage was soon conclu∣ded with the Princess  Henrietta Maria  of  France  and the Duke was sent thither to con∣duct her to the King A little after this a Par∣liament was called the House of Commons upon their first Assembly pressed for Redress of Grievances and against Recusants and they gave the King two Subsidies which did not answer his Wants and Expectations nor at all satisfy and the King finding the Parliament more stiff than he expected he soon dissolved them that sowre Humour against Kingly Pre∣rogative being then very predominant in the House of Commons and the Duke who in the last Parliament of King  James  was stiled The Saviour of the People in bringing Home  the then Prince of  Wales  was now called The Destroyer of the People and more cry'd down than he was before cry'd up and was named the Corrupter of the King and principal Cause of all Disorder who had betrayed the Subjects Liberties and his ill Management was made the Pretext for not assisting the King in Parlia∣ment as the State of the King's Affairs then required who used all possible Means to satis∣fy a discontented People but could not The late Parliament before their Dissolution de∣clared the King had sent Ships into  France  to assist the  French  King against his Protestant Subjects at  Rochel  which was by the Duke's Interest without acquainting the Council of State which much exasperated the People who complain'd that the Duke had not made the Match with  Spain  out of a particular Spleen against the  Conde d'Olivares  and had made it with  France  upon much harder Terms  The Duke being hereupon questioned in Par∣liament made a plausible Answer However the House of Commons resolved against any farther Supply except the two Subsidies they had given without Redress of Grievances After the Dissolution of this first Parliament some provisional Acts of State were made to supply the Defects in Law and a Proclama∣tion was published against Catholicks to give the People some Satisfaction and a Fleet was sent out by the Duke against  Cadiz  but retur∣ned with ill Success  In  February  following a second Parliament was called and the King was soon after crowned The Lord Keeper then made a Speech to the Parliament declaring the King's Love to them striving whether he should be a greater King or a better Man and that they were called to make good Laws and execute Justice The House of Commons presently fell upon Grie∣vances the Miscarriage of the  Cadiz  Voyage the Misemployment of the King's Revenue and reflected much upon the Duke and several bold Speeches were made against him and great Animosities still continued betwixt the Duke and the Earl of  Bristol  The King demands of the Parliament a present Supply and desired they would rather redress than inquire into Grievances The House of Commons exhibi∣ted Articles against the Duke desiring he might have no more Access to the King and agreed upon a Remonstrance against the Duke and pray'd the King not to dissolve them The Duke being much transported with this Usage prevailed with the King to dissolve them and fell into such Anger against some principal Members that they were imprisoned or disgra∣ced soon after Dissolution From this time the People were generally apprehensive of an arbi∣trary Government and were much unsatisfied with the excessive Greatness of the Duke who had a greater Ascendant upon his new Master the present King than upon his Predecessor which was much wondred at that the same Person should be the prime Favourite both to  Father and Son which bred a great Distemper of Humours in the Court which soon descen∣ded into the Country and the Displeasure to the Favourite soon seized their Duty to their Prince Kings raise some Men so high as to overtop All and keep them under but it is dangerous to bestow too much upon one Man for there is no Man fitting to be a King but he that is a King and when Kings are immo∣derate in bestowing their Power it many times brings much Woe to the People much Danger to the Person in Power and not seldom much Sorrow to the King himself And a wise Prince will not oblige his Courtiers who are Birds of Prey to disoblige his Subjects who are Beasts of Burthen It was indeed look'd upon as a rare Felicity and seldom known that the Duke should be in greater Favour with the Son than he was with the Father For the new King from the Death of the old King even to the Death of the Duke himself discover'd the most entire Confidence and even Friendship to the Duke that ever King shewed to any Subject all Preferments were given by him all his Friends and Kindred to that Degree in Honour Riches or Offices as the Duke thought fit all his Enemies discountenanced as he appointed But it was strange that he should so suddenly fall from the greatest Heighth of popular Esti∣mation to the lowest Depth of Calumny and Reproach by perswading the King to dissolve Parliaments which proved most pernicious to the Duke himself for in the first Parliament  of this King tho' most of the same Persons were chosen who so passionately adhered to him be∣fore the Affection they had then for him even of the same Men was turned into Animosity against him and that in so high a Nature that all the Actions of his Life were ript up Votes and Remonstrances passed against him as an Enemy to the Publick and his ill managing of the King's Grace and Favour to him made the Ground of their Refusal to give the King that Supply which he expected and was highly ne∣cessary for the King in that Conjuncture Here all the People's Discontents were laid up∣on the Duke in respect of the mighty Share he had in his Majesty's Favour and Affection and that he managed his Power to the Eclipse of all other great Men and moulded the Court to the Advantage principally of his own Family thinking thereby to strengthen himself instead of endeavouring to mollify the Misunderstan∣dings betwixt the King and his People which was his true Interest But the Duke's Want of Experience having never seen or felt the Re∣verse of Fortune made him too great an En∣terprizer to succeed in what he so unadvisedly undertook and so precipitately and for his own Satisfaction and upon his single Discon∣tent first ran the late King into a War with  Spain  which proved both fruitless and bur∣thensome to him And thus the Throne was endanger'd by him whose Obligation and true Interest it was to uphold it and King  Charles  did not only succeed to his Royal Father's  Crown but Troubles who was left involved in most strange Intrigues and Difficulties the Counsels of his Ministers being not then con∣ducted according to those Rules and Measures of Policy which the Circumstances and Necessities of the King's Affairs required which if they had been well managed had easily prevented the cruel Rebellion which afterwards followed  Thus we see Princes cannot be secure when leading Men in their own Courts fall into Fa∣ction and when there is most need of Concord and Unity Mens Minds are then most disuni∣ted and contrary to ancient Prudence when  England  wanted the best the worst Men were set at the Head of Business and our then most unhappy King was by Diversity of Counsels drawn oftentimes from his own Judgment which was better than theirs and was forced many times to court those he hated and to frown upon those whose Abilities and faithful Services to the Crown he secretly approved which is usually the Fate of such Princes who are drawn into Streights either by their Pre∣decessors or their own Negligence and at this time the greatest Part of the King's Counsel where wholly taken up in the Improvement of their own Fortunes or Gratification of their Pleasures which they earnestly affected and had so much to do for themselves that they wholly neglected the King's Affairs and those which were most able were frighted from meddling in them and when those Ministers whose Steadiness of Judgment and Directness  of Application to their Master's and the King∣dom's Honour and Advantage estrange them∣selves from Court it abates Mens Confidence in the successful Course of Affairs  The King being put to these Streights Ton∣nage and Pondage were levied by Order from the Board and likewise Loan Money and Be∣nevolence taken and the Duke finding the King somewhat unsatisfied with the  French  King and that the Queen's Servants were sending Home his Grace soon changed the Scene and caused the King to declare War against  France  and went in Person to the Isle of  Rhee  to assist the  Rochellers  against their King but he was there defeated and this Repulse was more un∣fortunate than that of  Cadiz  But in  March  following another Parliament was call'd and the King spake to them to expedite Business shewed them the common Danger moved for a Supply and told them plainly if they did not do their Duty he should be obliged to use other Mea∣sures which would not be so pleasing to them But however the House of Commons fell upon Grievances before Supply and after many Debates and some Conferences the Petition of Right was setled by Act of Parliament and several other Acts passed and then the Parlia∣ment was prorogued till  October  In this Interval the Duke resolved upon a second Attempt against  France  and was prepa∣ring for it at  Portsmouth  but was prevented by his sudden Murder which gave the King much Sorrow and Trouble And as the Duke during  Life was unfortunate in publick Affairs so his sudden Death produced a Change in all Counsels it being first generally agreed that the King should make a Peace with both Crowns since the War could not be carried on without Supplies and the Parliament was far∣ther prorogued till  January  which was ill taken And Kings of  England  will never do well to fence with the Inclinations of their Parliaments or Discontents of their People they must shew they have no other Interests but those of their Subjects in general for Par∣tiality in a Prince produces HeartBurnings to see some few lifted up high wallowing in Wealth and Pleasures while the People groan under heavy Taxes A Government is never well establish'd but in the Hearts of the Sub∣jects nor so hard to be shaken as when the Generality of the People as well as the Nobi∣lity are intirely satisfied which they will ne∣ver be till they see Men chosen into Offices by being fit for them and continued for dischar∣ging well and rewarded for extraordinary Me∣rit and punished for remarkable Faults In such Cases the King discharges the Severity of all Punishments upon the Parliament and com∣mits no Force upon the Gentleness of his own Nature when his Subjects see that no Ten∣derness of their Prince nor Corruption of his Ministers can preserve them from paying what they owe to any Forfeits of their Duty nor indeed can any Prince do Justice to those that serve him well without punishing those that  serve him ill since that is to make their Con∣ditions equal whose Deserts are different And therefore Kings should not only consent to but encourage any Inquiries a Parliament shall make into the Miscarriages of Ministers and join willingly with them therein But whether at that Time that the Parliament would have questioned the Duke of  Buckingham  they did then proceed from a steady Intention of a general Good or from some particular Animosities against the Duke or from some accidental Distempers from which the greatest and best Assemblies are not always free is still a great Question especially when such Assem∣blies have continued long together For then they will spy out and look after Miscarriages and Grievances rather than supply their law∣ful King and Sovereign 'Tis certainly true when Kings of  England  meet often with their Parliaments and agree with them they may command what they please But if a King's Revenue be such as to enable him to live without his Parliament he will be more free for the Meeting and long Sitting of Parliaments is dangerous for usually when publick Busi∣ness is ended nay many times before they have ended it they fall upon Grievances and enter into Factions to the great Prejudice of both King and Kingdom as hath been often seen and therefore  Posning  's Law was a good Pro∣vision against long Sitting of Parliaments However when Parliaments resolve to go upon Grievances Kings should never interpose to  secure their Favourites from answering Crimes which are alledged against them in Parliament as was intended against the Duke before the Parliament was prorogued for it lays an Im∣putation upon the Prince as being privy to their Actions and fixes also a Scandal upon the Person accused that he is generally thought guilty of all things laid to his Charge And this Course which was taken in the Beginning of King  Charles  's Government of Proroguing and Dissolving Parliaments rendred the Duke of  Buckingham  's Power more formidable be∣cause it was thought unlimited and tho' he was esteemed but as an Idol set up by King  James  and was therefore more contemptible to the People yet at the same time they thought the present King stood in Awe of him and was afraid to pull down that Favourite who was grown so formidable by his Power and the Number of his Followers and Adhe∣rents but such topheavy Buildings which have no solid Foundation in them of Merit are soon blown down and let bad Men have never so much seeming Greatness and Power they are seldom dangerous to wise Princes who will never hinder them from being brought to Punishment by a timely Sacrifice and no Man ever yet saw a Tumult to defend them And if this great Favourite the Duke had not been so soon murdered he had certainly been made a Victim to the Publick by the Parliament And when this Parliament met in  January  they were very troublesome fell upon Grievan∣ces  and made some Assaults against the Prero∣gative and were preparing some Accusations against the Lord Treasurer  Weston  And tho' the King sent the Black Rod for the Commons to come to the House of Lords they locked the Door of their House and not only refused Entrance to the Black Rod but forced the Speaker to his Chair till they had adjourned the House to a Day thinking thereby not to be dissolved before the Day of their Adjourn∣ment However the King went in Person to the House of Lords without calling the Com∣mons and dissolved the Parliament affirming that some Vipers in the House of Commons were the Cause of his dissolving them and at the same time very much courted and commen∣ded the Lords and after this Dissolution some of those Members who had carried them∣selves very insolently were committed to seve∣ral Prisons and the King to satisfy his People published a Proclamation shewing the Causes of dissolving those three Parliaments  In the Year Prince  Charles  was born at whose Birth great Rejoicing was thro' the whole Kingdom and in the King went to  Scotland  and was there Crowned with great Solemnity At his Return in ShipMoney was raised with great Care and Equality by Letters written from the PrivyCouncil to every HighSheriff and tho' this Pill was gilded it would not be swallowed but great Discontents were express'd at an Imposition never before practised and against Law But yet this was  done by the Advice and solemn Agreement of all the Judges except two  Hatton  and  Crook  who argued against it However they subscri∣bed for the King's doing it neither did the Judges do so much in this as was done in the Parliament of  H  VIII when it was agreed that the Legislative Power should be in the King and his Council in Intervals of Parliament and that the King's Proclamation should be of equal Force with an Act of Parliament And this was thought fit by the Parliament as being a dangerous thing that the King should be at Disadvantage for Want of Power in Case of sudden Exigencies And therefore there was Reason that the King should steer with a shor∣ter Rudder that his Care might meet with every Turn of Providence which might otherwise suddenly overturn the good Government of the Nation And it was then also declared in Par∣liament that if the Motions at home should wait upon the Debates in Parliament things must needs come short in Execution and the Affairs of the Nation extremely suffer And tho' this was but a temporary Law during the then present Condition of Affairs yet in the and of the same King another Law was made to confirm what was done before with a Power granted to the King and Council to change and alter as they should think fit And certainly the same Reason held as strong du∣ring the troublesome and impetuous Reign of King  Charles  tho' he thought not convenient to demand any such Power  The Opinion of  the Judges was subscribed in these Words fol∣lowing  We are of Opinion that when the Good and Safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned and the whole Kingdom in Danger your Maje∣sty may by Writ under the Great Seal of  Eng∣land  command all your Subjects of this King∣dom at their Charge to provide and furnish such Number of Ships with Men Victuals and Ammunition and for such Time as your Majesty shall think fit for the Defence and Safeguard of the Kingdom from such Peril and Danger and that by the Law your Majesty may compel the doing hereof and in Case of Refusal or Refractoriness we are also of Opinion that your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the Danger and when and how the same is to be prevented and avoided  The King did nothing herein but what he was advised to do by his Judges who were al∣ways esteemed the King's learned Council in the Law and if any thing was amiss in this Particular the Advisers were to answer for it which they did and some of them were suffici∣ently punished for it But whether they were punished deservedly or not is yet a Question Soon after the King's Return from  Scotland  Bishop  Laud  succeeded Archbishop  Abbot  in the See of  Canterbury  who being very powerful with the King advised the Setling the Church Government in  Scotland  as it was in  England  that there might be an Uniformity of Church Discipline in both Kingdoms and the King  sent down his Orders accordingly with a new Service Book of CommonPrayer with Com∣mand to be read in all the Churches But ma∣licious and designing Men who desire Innova∣tions in State do most commonly begin their first Attempt upon the Church as was seen in  Scotland  by their Commotions upon this Occa∣sion when they were at that time by God's Mercy to us and the King's Care over us in perfect Peace with all the Nations upon Earth The King by the Marquess of  Hamilton  his Commissioner did all he could to quiet those Troubles yet nothing would do for the  Scots  made a Covenant together and declared never to renounce it but prepared for War and from thence sprung the true Fountain of all our en∣suing Miseries in  England  This kind of Presby∣terian Government which was then established in  Scotland  had found good Reception in some of the  Gallican  and  Belgian  Churches and which  Beza  used his utmost Endeavours to plant in  England  But wary Queen  Elizabeth  stood fix'd and could not be brought to any Unsettlement of the ancient Discipline of Epis∣copacy But in  Scotland  this new Form prospe∣red by the Artifices of  Buchanan  and  Knox  and during King  James  's Minority they threw down Bishops and setled Presbytery and used their King as they pleased  About this Time the short Parliament of drew near the King being then at  York  was preparing to return to  London  It was then considered whether the Earl of  Strafford  should stay with the Army or go with the King to  London  The Earl shewed many substantial Reasons for his not going and knowing how much the  Scots  were incensed against him and how great an Interest they would have in the Parliament That by his Absence he would not be so much in their Mind and that if any thing should be objected against him he might the better avoid and retire from any Danger and be better able to do the King Service else∣where when the King's Occasions should require it as he much feared they would but no Ar∣guments could prevail but the King continued earnest for his going with him and assured him in the Word of a King if he should be questioned he would so defend him that a Hair of his Head should not be touched and so the Earl resolved to submit to the King's Commands tho' he foresaw his own Destruction in it  In  April  the Parliament met when  Glanville  was chosen Speaker A Message was soon sent by the King to the House of Commons for Supplies shewing the intolerable Indignities and Injuries of the  Scots  who had not only common Ties of Nature Sovereignty and Bounty upon that Nation with his late royal Father but had twice gratified the active Spi∣rit among them so far that he had preferred the Desires of that Party before his own Inte∣rest or Honour and his royal Bounty to them had emboldened them to ask and act beyond all Bounds of Modesty and Gratitude which made the King more scandalized at their coming into  England  contrary to his Will and with the Forfeiture of so many Obligations of Duty to him It is true that when they first entered  England  Success crowned their Work being thought a wise and resolute Nation who after an unbloody War for above one Year returned laden with Spoils and great Riches and were most liberally rewarded as well for going out as coming into  England  But God's Justice was in the End discovered through all their Preten∣tions of Religion in which they wrapt up their wicked Designs who built their Piety upon the Ruines of Loyalty and made Bankrupt of their Allegiance to set up a quicker Trade for Re∣ligion Upon this Account the King as he had good Reason was very angry with them and declared if the House of Commons would assist him suitable to the Exigency of his Affairs he would not only quit his Claim to ShipMo∣ney but would give them full Satisfaction in all their just Demands which Message was much approved by both Houses and many Con∣ferences were held whether the Supply or the Subjects Grievances should precede The Lords voted for the first but the Commons for the latter however the Difference was soon unhappily decided by a voluntary Mistake in old Sir  Henry Vane  then Secretary of State who was ordered by the King and Council to demand six Subsidies and he demanded twelve which was so highly unreasonable that many were much displeased but all were inclined to have given six which was no usual Gift  Sir  Henry Vane  escaped not without great Censure for demanding Double to his Com∣mission but it was really believed this Mi∣stake was purposely done to raise the House to Animosities which took Effect for the House would not consent to what he demanded but insisted upon their Grievances which made the King so desperate that he forthwith dissol∣ved the Parliament The Counsel given to dissolve them was generally disliked because the Differences between the King and this Par∣liament might have been cemented by the Lords and the  Scots  Troubles by this Parliament appeased which grew wider by this Breach and the Odium of this was laid upon Archbi∣shop  Laud  who was thought to be more busy in temporal Matters than he ought and be∣ing too full of Fire tho' a just good Man his too much Zeal for the Church made him per∣swade the King to the Sitting of the Convoca∣tion which ought not to have been done af∣ter Dissolution of the Parliament The King then caused a Guard to be set about  Westmin∣ster  while the Convocation sat who setled the Discipline of the Church and would not alter the Government by Bishops and they granted a Benevolence to the King of Four Shillings in the Pound for six Years towards his Expe∣dition against the  Scots  wherein the Archbi∣shop was very active The  Scots  were at this time come into a warmer Climate than their own and Petitioned the King for Redress of their Grievances in several Articles All good  Men inveighed sufficiently against them whilst others approved of their Proceedings There was at this time a strange Spirit of Division in the Opinions of Men of these Affairs too many not only favouring but joining with the  Scotch  Covenanters who presented their De∣mands How their Army should be maintained till the Treaty was ended and Peace secured and so they had a great Allowance But the King's best Subjects said the King should rather have put All to the Issue of a Battle than to give such Terms to most rebellious Subjects But the King saw plainly that divers Officers of his own Army and even the private Soldi∣ers had no Mind to fight against the  Scots  which made the King conclude the Treaty with them The Earl of  Montrose  who had great Alliances in  Scotland  came then into  England  to serve the King but by the Marquess of  Hamilton  's Cunning who betrayed the King in all the  Scotch  Affairs  Montrose  was slighted and neglected whereupon he went back to the Covenanters but being soon weary of them he wrote to the King professing his great Loy∣alty and Service to his Majesty which Letter was taken out of the King's Pocket at Night by the Marquess of  Hamilton  and sent to the Covenanters  About this Time a Resolution was taken by the King and Council to call another Parlia∣ment the great Necessity of the King's Affairs then obliging him to it The Court Party la∣boured much to bring in their Friends but  those that were most esteemed at Court had least Respect and Interest in the Country and it was not a little strange to see what a Spirit of Opposition was in the Hearts of most Men to the Court's Proceeding So that very few of the King's Party were chosen Members of Par∣liament And indeed the highest Danger in  England  comes from the Power of the People to elect their Representatives for they will be such as are of their own Complexion and which will stand by them in all their Designs against the Government for clipping the Wings of Monarchy and restraining the King's lawful Prerogative which was the true Reason why the King broke so many Parliaments but at last being wearied and overborne he was necessita∣ted to give Way to their Meeting in which by several Encroachments upon the Royal Prerogative their long Sitting and Suc∣cess in their Rebellion brought their lawful Sovereign at last to the Block as will be seen in the Sequel of these  Memoirs  This Long Parliament was convened to meet  November  a most ominous Day for the Parliament met that Day in  H  VIII which began with the Fall of Cardinal  Wolsey  and therefore Archbishop  Laud  was desired to get their Meeting adjourned for some Days But the good Man took no Notice of those things At their first Meeting the King told them he was resolved to put himself freely upon the Love and Affection of his Subjects and left it intirely to them where to begin  promising them Redress of Grievances and de∣sired that all Suspicion of each other should be laid aside The House of Commons after establishing Committees fell upon Grievances and many sharp Speeches were made upon that Subject The King passed the Bill for the Tri∣ennial Parliament and thereby declared his great Confidence in them and the extraordina∣ry Favour he did his Subjects by passing that Bill The House of Commons fell presently upon the Earl of  Strafford  whom they accu∣sed of High Treason and desired he might be secured which was done accordingly and great Preparations made for his Trial in  WestminsterHall  before the Lords and one of the sharpest Managers of the Evidence against his Lordship says That  No Man ever acted a Part on such a Theatre with more Wisdom Elo∣quence and Constancy and with greater Reason Judgment and Temper and with a better Grace  than that great Lord and excellent Person did so that he moved the Hearts of all his Auditors some few excepted to great Pity and Remorse His Lordship told them it was hard that Pu∣nishment should precede Promulgation of a Law to be punished by a Law subsequent to the Fact was never heard of till that time that there should no Mark be set by which the Offence might be known no Admonish∣ment given to avoid it was a Case extreme hard The King heard all the Tryal and after went to the House of Lords and sent for the Commons and did passionately desire the Par∣liament  not to proceed severely against the Earl of  Strafford  assuring them in the Word of a Christian that he could not in Conscience con∣demn him and added that neither Fear nor any other Respect should make him go against his Conscience However the Bill of Attain∣der passed both Houses and a Bill not to pro∣rogue adjourn or dissolve the Parliament without Consent of both Houses Thus when Men seek to limit and confine the King to their Reason they must needs have a secret Aim to share with him or usurp upon him in his Pow∣er and Dominion For good Men in Parliament will propose nothing to their King nor expect any thing from their King but what he will be as ready to give them as they are to receive from him  The King was much perplexed at the sending to him these two Bills and sent for some of his Bishops and others of his intimate Counsel∣lours to have their Advice what Measures to take who advised him to pass the Bills And the Earl of  Strafford  being informed of the King's great Perplexity wrote to the King de∣siring him to pass the Bill against him saying his Consent would acquit the King before Al∣mighty God Whereupon the King passed the Bill and sent Mr Secretary  Carleton  to ac∣quaint the Earl with it who not believing without some Astonishment that the King would have passed the Bill he rose from his Chair and lifting up his Eyes to Heaven clapp'd his Hand upon his Breast and said with some  Passion  Put not your Trust in Princes nor in the Sons of Men for there is no Truth in them  which he had some Reason to say because the King had engaged him to come to  London  con∣trary to his own Sentiment and had faithfully assured him in the Word of a King that in Case he should be attack'd in Parliament he would so defend him that a Hair of his Head should not be touched And now by this un∣expected Message he had Notice given him of his Death to which he really believed the King would never have consented which made him break out in that Expression with some more than ordinary Movement believing his Letter to the King would have made him more firm in his Resolution Great Reflections were made upon the King's passing these two Bills the one against his most faithful Servant and the other against himself The first took away the Life of that great Statesman the other his own Life both Bills being signed at the same Time and with the same Pen The King had great Remorse for what he had done and the next Day sent a Letter to the Lords written with his own Hand by the Prince of  Wales  to inter∣cede for the Earl's Life but nothing would prevail tho' it was confidently affirmed by some that the Earl's Life was promised the King to encourage him to pass the Bill But now the Lords would not consent to his Maje∣sty's Desire And thus fell this noble Earl who for natural Parts and Abilities for Im∣provement of Knowledge by Experience in  greatest Affairs for Wisdom Fidelity Obe∣dience and Gallantry left no Equal behind him A little after this to satisfy the King in somewhat the House of Commons granted an Act for Tonnage and Pondage which the King took before as due by his Prerogative but now as a Gift from his People  The Parliament then adjourned till Winter it being thought fit the King should go into  Scot∣land  the People there beginning to shew their Discontents more publickly where the King being in Person might better redress their Grie∣vances as they call'd them The King then granted every thing they desired without ask∣ing any Questions till they declared they had no more to ask the King having entirely fulfil∣led their Desires and as the Phrase then went  He parted a contented King from a contented People  For from the Time of the King's co∣ming among them he had fully complied with all they desired both for the publick Govern∣ment and their private Advancements The Kingdom of  Scotland  within it self enjoyed perfect Peace and Tranquillity and the King was confident the Affections of the  Scots  could not be corrupted believing they were sensible of their former Breach of Duty and willing to repair it by any Service and that their Gene∣ral  Lesly  had made great Acknowledgments and Professions of Duty to his Majesty and would be always ready and willing to serve him About the End of  November  this Year the King returned well satisfied from  Scotland  and was  upon his Arrival most sumptuously entertained by the City of  London  The King then went to the Parliament and made a Speech to both Houses wherein he told them he made as much Haste to them as his Affairs in  Scotland  permitted and that he had left that Nation in a most peaceable and con∣tented Condition And yet he was no sooner gone from them but they subscribed their Co∣venant raised an Army against their lawful King made  Lesly  their General to join with their dear Brethren in  England  who were then hatching a Rebellion against their King who then told them in Parliament That tho' he did not find  England  so well setled as he expected being full of Jealousies and Alarms of De∣signs and Plots yet he doubted not of his Sub∣jects good Affections by his Reception at his Return And added That he was so far from repenting what he had done for them that he was willing and ready to pass any thing more that might justly be desired for their Liberties Properties and Maintenance of their Religion and desired them not to be discontented at their own Happiness nor to be without Sense of their natural Allegiance And that having got∣ten the Opinion of being good Patriots for their Country they should not be inveigled into Steps of Disloyalty nor to use such Measures as would disturb the Throne The King also re∣commended to them the Business of  Ireland  where it seems a Rebellion broke out during his Absence in  Scotland  and the King offered  to go thither in Person to prosecute those Re∣bels but the Parliament would not agree to it Now he that governs three Kingdoms com∣posed of three several Nations whose Religi∣on Manners and Language are different and whose Passions and Interests are contrary to each other must keep a constant severe Hand over them For to think of governing them as King  Charles  I did by a gentle and obliging Temper was as impossible as to think of put∣ting six wild Horses to a Coach and to drive them without Whip or Reins And whoever hath read the pious Meditations of King  Charles  hath there found by his own Words that he condescended against his own Judgment and Conscience to settle Presbytery in  Scot∣land  and it appeared soon after how unhap∣py this King was in his too kind and tender Condescensions to the  Scots  which occasioned all those Troubles he had in the North of  Eng∣land  The Presbyterians called God to witness that nothing was so dear to them as the Honour and Safety of the King and at the same time they conspired against both They seemed won∣derfully sollicitous for his Life and Safety when they were complotting how to entrap him They told us their dear Liberties and Proper∣ties hung upon the Thread of the King's Life and yet at that Instant they were resolved to cut that Thread off But the good Christians of old did not use this Method they prayed for their Princes and Governours when most bar∣barously and unjustly provoked to the contrary  so that no Christian died as a Rebel or Traytor in all the early Persecutions of Christianity for several Centuries The Presbyterians made it their Business by their libellous Pamphlets and other wicked Arts not only to make the King's Government odious his faithful Subjects suspected but also to excite a Hatred to his Royal Person and made use of the Name of  Popery  to carry on all their wicked Designs being the common Engine they have always play'd against the Government For it hath been observed that the Prerogative never so suffered no great Statesman was ever disgra∣ced nor the Liberties of the People ever wounded but a dreadful Outcry of  Popery  hath still preceded and if any durst shew his Fidelity to Monarchy by opposing their Anti∣monarchical Projects he was presently blasted with the Name of a  Court  or a  Church Papist  And when they could not undermine the Go∣vernment by Fraud they would overthrow it by main Force and always had those in great Estimation who made the biggest Noise for Religion and made no Scruple of involving three Kingdoms in Misery and Confusion They strained at Conformity but swallowed down Rebellion they stumbled at the Rails before the Altar but leap'd over Dethroning their King whom they murdered first in his Reputation by calling him Tyrant whose Fault was only his Clemency and then they murdered him in his Person  I remember well what  Josephus  says in his  Antiquities Lib    Cap  That the  Pharisees  were a bold Sect that would swear Allegiance to  Caesar  but were inveterate Enemies to Kings and would not stick to make Attempts upon their Lives And the Difference betwixt those  Pharisees  and ours is that they were  Jewish  Fanaticks and ours are Christian  Jews  which appears by their Principles who say the King holds not his Power  Jure Divino  but is the People's Trustee and to them accountable A Doctrine which leads to the Destruction of all Kings What our Blessed Saviour told his Dis∣ciples that  the Times were coming when they that killed them should think they did God good Service  was seen about this Time when Chur∣ches were pulled down for God's Glory when Religion was called  Popery  and Monarchy  Tyranny  when Atheists would reform Religion Bankrupts secure Property and Army Officers guard Liberty When the Property of Nobi∣lity and Gentry was held to be destructive of Liberty and it was a dangerous thing for Men to have any Sense of their Duty and Allegiance But alas those that foment such Animosities and Divisions do more Mischief to their Coun∣try than foreign Enemies No Fears of Arbi∣trary Government can justify no Zeal for Re∣ligion can sanctify such Proceedings To live and die with their King is the highest Professi∣on a Subject can make and he serves his Coun∣try best who well serves his King And truly I am perswaded that many Men entred into  our  English  Rebellion who little thought of any such thing at their first setting out but were easily drawn in by entering into the So∣ciety of evil Men and were not guilty of such black Intentions and were led away with the common Error and false Presumptions that no∣thing was at the Bottom but to settle the true Interest of the Nation and so fight for the King and Parliament together which they thought was their Duty but being once engaged they went rashly farther than they at first intended But a true Christian Zeal will not suffer us to transgress the strict Bounds of our Duty both to God and the King whatever flattering Pro∣spect of Advantage it may give  Omne in prae∣cipiti vitium stetit  When Men once espouse an ill Party like those running down a Hill they cannot stop when they will and I really believe that some Proselytes were made who at first abhorred the Thoughts of Treason and Rebellion but were merely seduced by the Insi∣nuation and Address of some busy Factors for Sedition and Rebellion And therefore wise Men should take Care of listning to any Suspi∣cion of their Prince and not to hear with Pleasure any scandalous Reflections of him for he that can with Content hear his King vilified will soon think him not fit to be a King And tho' we do not think at first to be turning Re∣bels yet whatsoever is at first but a Tending to∣wards it proves so at last there being more Danger that the Beginnings of Vice should corrupt us than any Hope that a sound Dispo∣sition  should correct the Influence of such a Vice  At this Time a great Diffidence began betwixt the Court and the Country Party in Parliament and the Disadvantage lay altogether on the King's Side who had then such Counsellours as did not do their Duty and so the Head and Members of our Monarchy entred into Distrust of each other which filled the Kingdom with Confusions Miseries and infinite Desolations The King had then no Counsellours about him or at least did not trust them that had the least Consideration for his Honour or Friendship for them that sat at the Helm of Affairs and the King had no Counsellours but those that made false Steps There was no honest Man that durst speak his Conscience to the King for fear of his Ruine and those that the King thought most true to him betrayed him every Hour and his very Whispers in his Bedcham∣ber were presently conveyed to them against whom those Whispers were So that the King had very few to whom he could breathe his Plaints that were not suborned against him or averse to his Opinions And that King can ne∣ver be a great Monarch who hath not just and wise Counsellours by whom he must inform his Reason and guide his Actions and use the Service and Industry of the best and wisest Men  It was about this Time that the Parliament avowed publickly that the Power was entirely in them and that the King being sever'd from  them had no Royal Power in him and the House of Commons did then petition the King touching their Privileges declaring the King ought to take no Notice of any Debate in either House of Parliament but by Information from them nor be displeased with any Debate be∣fore it was presented to him the Members of Parliament being the sole Judges of their own Errors in Matters depending before them Many Members thought the Petition was too rough but the general Fate of things then drove that Way to increase the Jealousy be∣twixt the King and his People and the Parlia∣ment declared they would not proceed in any Affairs till they had a satisfactory Answer to their Petition The King before any Answer given withdraws to  Hampton Court  which in∣creases the Discontents in Parliament who sent a Committee to him at  Hampton Court  to tell the King plainly that the whole Frame of Go∣vernment was out of Order and a Remon∣strance was prepared by the Parliament very roughly penn'd both for Matter and Expressi∣ons in it wherein were mentioned all the Mi∣stakes Misfortunes Illegalities and Defaults of Government with an Enumeration of all Grievances and not one single Error in Go∣vernment omitted nor any passionate Exercise of Power from the Death of King  James  till that time and that they had no Hopes of set∣ling the Distractions of the Kingdom by rea∣son of the evil Counsellours and malignant Party that were about the King And when this  Remonstrance was read in the House some mo∣derate Members did then protest against it and were sent to the  Tower  for it but they were soon after released Soon after this the King came again to  Whitehall  and being informed that some Members of Parliament had private Meetings and Correspondence with the  Scots  and countenanced the late Tumults which came from the City to  Whitehall  and which caused the King's Removal to  Hampton Court  The King upon this Information gave a War∣rant to seal up their Trunks Studies and Pa∣pers upon which the Commons having Notice passed several Votes against it and justified their Members Whereupon the King exhibi∣ted Articles against the five Members which were named for endeavouring to subvert the fundamental Laws and Government and to deprive the King of his Regal Power The King taking Notice that the House of Com∣mons would defend their Members went sud∣denly the next Morning with his Guard of Pensioners entered the House of Commons stept into the Speaker's Chair and look'd round the House for the Members who having had Notice of the King's Coming were gone the King said he was sorry for the Occasion of his Coming thither having sent the Day before a Sergeant at Arms to apprehend some that were accused of High Treason whereunto he expe∣cted Obedience and not a Message as they had sent him and he said no King was ever more careful of their Privileges but that  in Cases of HighTreason no Person had a Privilege and therefore commanded the Spea∣ker to send them to him who replied that he had neither Eyes to see nor Tongue to speak in that Place but as the House should direct him And so the King returned to  Whitehall  This Action of the King's was look'd upon as a great Breach of their Privileges and was judged extreamly prejudicial to the King and much to his Enemies Advantage and was thought ve∣ry strange by those who had any Knowledge in publick Affairs that the King was advised to so an intemperate an Action and many Excuses were made for it and said it was done by Wo∣mens Counsel that the King should not suffer himself to be so baffled which provoked him to it Many of the King's Friends resented his going to the House as a Motion rising rather from Passion than Reason being not guided with such Discretion as the Touchiness of those Times required Upon this the House of Commons frame a Declaration That the King's Coming to the House in a warlike Manner to the Terror of the Parliament was a high Breach of their Privileges and inconsistent with their Liberty and that they could not sit safely without a Guard for which they had been Suitors to the King but could not obtain it Upon this great Tumults were in the City and at  Westminster  and as the King went through the City great Tumults flocked about his Coach beseeching him to agree with his Parliament The King being in Danger of these Tumults was coun∣selled  to remove again to  Hampton Court  which he did and took with him the Queen Prince of  Wales  and the Duke of  York  which was much wondred at by prudent Men that the King should leave the Place of his Residence which brought great Disadvantage upon himself and his Affairs But the Fear of those with him and his own Fears for them occasioned by the Tumults with the Hopes that by his Absence the Heat of the Parliament might in some Measure abate were alledged to ex∣cuse his Majesty's Retiring But on the other Side no Reason can be given for Rebellion but Pretences for where Monarchy is setled as in  England  the Respect due to it could not be violated without being guilty of a kind of Sacrilege it being not only a Resemblance of that Power which God hath given the King but a Participation of that Power which none can resist without the Breach of God's Com∣mand But People at this time were willing to be led blindfold by their own Representa∣tives rather than be guided by their Prince and a few subtle Heads in a House of Commons are dangerous when they oppose the Royal Autho∣rity and are backed by the Multitude Some Men softly instill the Venom of their Princi∣ples and bring about their Ends by insinua∣ting themselves into publick Affairs and their Complaints sometimes seem plausible that they may gain Proselytes to their Faction who may not mean so ill as their Leaders do For with what plausible Pretences were many Thousands  first engaged in the War against King  Charles  What more plausible than to engage in a War for the Defence of King and Parliament It is the Constitution of our Government and we were happy if we had well understood it where our Laws are propounded by our selves in Parliament and ratified by our Kings which is our proper Freedom as  Englishmen  and from the due Execution of those Laws arises our Safety But cunning and ambitious Men in the House of Commons who framed the Platform of all our Miseries fixed the odious Name of  Malignants  upon all those that adhered to the King and the known Laws and who would not run to the same Excess of Madness and Re∣bellion with them And I well remember the time when Parliament Soldiers plundered the Houses and took away the Horses of honest Countrymen who liv'd peaceably at Home only because they were call'd Malignants and that Name did warrant the Plunder The Ef∣fects of these Complaints brought that Civil War upon us in and the Decoy to en∣gage Men then was to fight for King and Par∣liament but the War ended in the Ruine of both when Subjects bathed their Swords in the Blood of their King a Murder committed by the Mockery of Justice never to be forgot∣ten and yet never to be mentioned without Horror and Detestation 'Tis true that Offen∣ces are given and taken in all Governments Kings sit uneasy on their Thrones where their People are tumultuous and Religion is disgra∣ced  and God hath exercised our  English  Na∣tion with a various Face of Afflictions in the last Age Our Fears and Jealousies did even anticipate our Miseries and we oftentimes brought real Miseries upon our selves by hast∣ning to prevent the fancied ones But when cunning Men design against the Government they live under 'tis plain they would be Go∣vernours themselves and they murmur at Mer∣cies as  Israel  did at  Manna  and their Hearts open and shut according to their own Rules when they strain at Gnats and swallow Ca∣mels like the  Neopolitan  Shepherd who going to his Confessor at  Easter  nothing so much troubled his Conscience as that he had tasted a little Cream the  Lent  before but he had often robbed and murdered Passengers in the Mountains which troubled not his Conscience because his Father and Grandfather had fol∣lowed that Trade before  The Truth is the Power of King  Charles  after his strange Condescension to let the Par∣liament sit as long as they pleased was little more than imaginary The Crown of  England  gives no proper Strength to them that wear it if personal Force be not proportioned to their Station which if it reached as far as Prero∣gative it would be a mighty Advantage for then a Monarch might be sure but as this unhappy King's Case stood his Empire consi∣sted chiefly in his Submission to other Mens Wills which was in a Manner but reigning by Courtesy And therefore the Affections of  the People is generally the strongest but not the best Title as we have often seen and felt in  England  in the last and this Age Where∣fore all Degrees of Inferiority should be ten∣derly used for if they be trampled upon they will certainly grow sowre and stubborn believing they have a Right to be always well used And the least Grievances suggest muti∣nous Thoughts in them and they presently run up their Pedigree to  Adam  saying  In the Beginning it was not so  And thus the House of Commons served King  Charles  being full of dutiful Affections and Expressions and abounded with large Promises of what Demon∣strations of Duty they would shortly make him in acknowledging his Royal Favour and Prote∣ction to be a great Blessing to them and Pre∣servation of their Liberties and Privileges when any of which were infringed they were found humbly to appeal to his Justice for Redress the Rights and Privileges of Parliament not be∣ing only their Birthright and Inheritance but of the whole Kingdom one of which Privileges undoubtedly was that the whole Right of the Revenue upon the Book of Rates was the People's and proceeded only from his Subjects Gifts and then they inflicted severe Penalties upon those that should presume for the future to collect them or to raise any Money but as the Parliament should grant and appoint By which Means the King was exposed to all the Dangers that might happen either at Home or Abroad and also deprived of the Possibility of  supporting the Government it self and was thereby reduced to a more helpless Condition than the meanest of his Subjects by their un∣worthy Votes and unwarrantable Proceedings Thus the House of Commons served the King and did then farther declare that tho' the Power of the Militia was wholly in the King yet the Power of the Money was solely in them and that without the Power of the Mo∣ney to pay the Soldiers the Power of the Militia could be of little Force So that unless the King and the House of Commons agreed the Sword must be left in the Scabbard They then also declared That the King's Coming to the House and the Speech he made there was a great Breach and therefore desired he would name the Persons that advised and induced him to that Action that they might be punished this being the only Way to procure a firm Con∣fidence and Amity betwixt the King and his People  In Answer to this the King conjured them by all the Obligations of Love Duty and Obedience to remove all their Doubts and Fears and that doing so he did not doubt but God would render him a Great and Glorious Prince and them a free and happy People But to all these Offers he had most unsuitable Returns so that then the King perceived plain∣ly that the House of Commons were by De∣grees stealing so much Power into their own Hands that they did not care what remained in his For they had got the Art of imposing  upon the People's Understandings against their own Reason and perswaded them they were in Danger of Invasion when the King was not only in Peace with all Christendom but even those Princes that were in War desired his Assi∣stance And his Majesty was so moved with those odious Imputations which had most per∣nicious Effects upon the Minds of his People that he was forced to comply with many things contrary to his Judgment to obviate greater Inconveniencies which were likely to rise against him by those false and scandalous Sug∣gestions And therefore he often answered their seditious and undutiful Expressions with too much Gentleness and Condescension thinking that Way to undeceive them and thereby to restore them to their Understandings before they could be awakened to their Duty due to their Sovereign the King believing he was to stoop to all Arts and Means for that Purpose But herein he was ill advised and took false Measures for tho' the Proceedings of the House of Commons and the Tumults raised by them were the highest Affront to his Majesty yet the House of Peers was then in a tractable Temper and with a little Patience might have been brought to blast all the Extravagancies of the House of Commons But other Resoluti∣ons were then taken which proved fatal to the King and Kingdom It is true the Votes and Affronts of the House of Commons were great and the Tumults also but the House of Lords was then well disposed and if managed by the  King with a little Patience the Higher House had blasted all the Extravagancies of the Low∣er House which at that Time were the At∣tempts of Persons in Despair and the Strug∣lings of Men at the last Gasp And if the King would have been only a Spectator of the Di∣vision between the two Houses and so have encouraged the Lords who were firm to the King the Commons would have been brought within their due Limits but the King thought by his Gentleness and easy Carriage to recover his Subjects to their Sobriety before they would be apprehensive of their Duty and by that Way undid all The Truth is the King's Passing the Bill against the Bishops was a great Weakening of his Party not only by losing so many Voices in the Lords House but it much influenced those whose Minds were then in Suspense to see Foundations shaken Besides they that knew well the King's Disposition did believe nothing could have prevailed with him to pass so Antimonarchical an Act and there∣fore could never after be sure the King would deny any thing that was importunately asked And so either some withdrew themselves from those Consultations that they might decline the Danger of Envy by contradicting them or else suffered themselves patiently to be car∣ried on by the Stream and to agree to any thing that was lustily attempted But truly I think nothing ought to discourage publick Spirits from contributing all they can to the Firmness of such Counsels as they esteem most just and safe  for the publick Good and not to withdraw themselves upon any Pretence Certainly the King was here overperswaded to agree with the Parliament in this Act against Bishops that so for the future he might be able to deny them nothing and this Condescension of his Maje∣sty was very surprizing to the whole Kingdom and much blamed by all but only those who had a Hand in perswading the King to it  It was then indeed a sad Prospect to see the melancholy Condition the King was in sunk in a few Days from the Heighth of all Great∣ness which made his Enemies before to fear him to such a Degree of Lowness that his own Servants durst hardly come near him He then perceived when it was too late that his Granting more than ever Prince had done had encouraged the People to ask more than ever Subjects had demanded and yet the King de∣clared if he knew the particular Grounds of his Subjects Fears he would most gladly apply suitable Remedies and desired they would not out of Apprehension of possible Dangers throw his Majesty and themselves into real and present Inconveniencies and that they would pursue such Methods as might restore Felicity both to King and People The King farther assured the House of Commons That he would satisfy all their just Demands by retracting any thing he had done which seemed but to intrench upon their Privileges and hoped they would have the same Regard to his Honour and Reputation with that of his Subjects But whatsoever the  King said or promised signified little with the Parliament For then both Houses declared they were the supreme Judicature of the King∣dom and when they had declared what the Law of the Land was to have it disputed or contradicted tho' by the King's Command was a Breach of Privilege and not to be obey∣ed which was to declare in plain Terms that a Vote of the two Houses was obligatory to all without tho' against his Majesty's Con∣sent which Resolve did absolutely annull the Laws of the Land and Liberty of the Subject and let all sober Men see that the fatal Period of both was near an End and that a Founda∣tion was then laid for Anarchy which soon followed  But I must not forget to say that a little be∣fore the War was declared the Queen went with the Princess  Mary  her Daughter to the Prince of  Orange  her Husband and was ac∣companied by the King to  Dover  from whence the King returned to  Greenwich  and sent for the Prince of  Wales  and the Duke of  York  to go with him towards  York  where he was well received The Parliament sent after him the nineteen Propositions which were treated on and refused by the King But I will not omit one Passage at  Greenwich  before the King left it which was somewhat strange and ominous which was thus The King commanded his Statue to be carried from  Greenwich  Garden into the Magazine In the Carriage of it the Face being upwards a Swallow or some other  Bird flying over it dunged in the Face of the King's Statue which was wiped off immediate∣ly by those that carried it but notwithstanding all Endeavours it could not be gotten off but turned into Blood This Statue was made at  Rome  by the famous Statuary Signor  Bernino  and when the King's Picture was brought to him by which he was to make the Statue with po∣sitive Directions to conceal whose Picture it was Signor  Bernino  after having look'd some∣time very stedfastly upon it said he had never seen any Picture whose Face shewed so much Greatness and withal such Marks of Sadness and Misfortune which proved too true in all its Circumstances for never any King kept greater State or Order in his Court and was more majestick in keeping up his Dignity till at last he was made a sad Spectacle both to Men and Angels before his own Palace  But leaving this Digression it is Time to tell you that both Houses declared the King∣ly Prerogative which was before lodged in the Crown tho' with some Limitations was now no more there but in the two Houses of Par∣liament Whereas by the Constitution of the  English  Government the King is singly Sove∣reign and no Power on Earth coordinate with him And as Almighty God is the absolute So∣vereign of all Princes so imperial Princes as the Kings of  England  are esteemed are abso∣lute next and immediately under God to whom alone they are accountable And there∣fore those that set the Laws above the Maker  of them or subordinate Magistrates above the Fountain of the first Power usurp upon the original Founder and take upon them to re∣move the unchangeable Foundations of Power it self For there is no longer any Govern∣ment where the Inferior incroaches upon the Superior and confounds the Relations of Kings and Subjects in that Anarchical Whimsey of imagining that Kings are to govern by Contract and Subjects to obey accordingly Whereas no Man can shew that there ever was an Origi∣nal Contract between former Kings and the People of  England  besides that which was implied in the Constitution and the very Sup∣position of one is repugnant to all our Laws and expressly opposite to the Words and Sense of many of our Statutes there being nothing more irreconcileable and contradictory than a Contract by which our Kings are made judici∣ally accountable to their People or censurable for Miscarriages in their Government when several Acts of Parliament do not only declare our Kings to be unaccountable but make it High Treason to take up Arms against them upon any Pretence whatsoever And to ima∣gine it either lawful or practicable to question and depose Kings without a Liberty of taking up Arms against them is a Contradiction that none will pretend to reconcile who are not Lunatick or deeply Hypochondriacal And as for that Contract in our first Constitution it only declares the Ends for which our Princes were to Rule  viz  The Safety Peace and  Prosperity of their People to teach and instruct them that they were to govern by Laws but it no way promises that they should be accoun∣table to their People or arraigned by their Subjects leaving them for that only responsible to God and in no manner punishable but by the Stings of their own Consciences  For who can say to the King what doest thou  About this Time the War was openly decla∣red against the King after his being refused Entrance into  Hull  whereupon he went to  York  The Earl of  Essex  was named General for the Parliament the Earl of  Bedford  Ge∣neral of the Horse The Lord  Kimbolton Sta∣pleton Balfour  and  Ramsey  General Officers for the Parliament Whereupon the King na∣med the Earl of  Lindsey  Lord Chamberlain of  England  to be his Lieutenant General Prince  Rupert  Cousin to the King General of the Horse Sir  Jacob Astley  Major General of the Foot and Lord  Wilmot  Commissary General of the Horse  Thus the War was began and the King by a very unhappy Accident was obliged to de∣clare before he was in any Condition for Action The Occasion This Collonel  Goring  Gover∣nour of  Portsmouth  declared for the King before the King was ready to march to his Suc∣cour Upon some private Suspicion the Par∣liament had of  Goring  he was sent for and examined and upon his Confession of some things relating to the Army the Lords  Wilmot Ashburnham  and  Pollard  all three Members  were expelled the House of Commons and sent to several Prisons but  Peircy  and  Jermyn  who were also Members accused escaped This Confession of  Goring  gave him a great Reputa∣tion with the Parliament who sent him back to his Government with Money to pay the Sol∣diers and to take Care of his Government By his great Dexterity he perswaded the King that he was not only sorry for the Fault he had com∣mitted but that he would soon redeem it by some signal Service to the King and he managed him∣self with such Address that he received Three Thousand Pounds from the Queen to fortify the Garrison when it should be necessary for him to declare for the King and at the same time he received a great Supply from the Parliament for Payment of the Garrison that it might be kept for their Service Some time after upon some new Information he was sent for again and appeared in the House and justified himself with so much Innocence and Unaffected∣ness that the House of Commons after an Apology for the Trouble they had given him commanded him to return to his Government and to take great Care for the Safety of the Place which was of much Importance to them and consented to all he proposed in behalf of the Garrison In the mean time he assured his Majesty by those that were employed be∣tween them that in a short time he should be in a Condition to declare for the King when the King should require it but by the Sequel we shall find he was obliged to do it much  sooner than he was prepared for it tho' no sooner than he had Reason to expect it It seems when the Lord  Kimbolton  received his Commission to be Lieutenant General of the Horse for the Parliament  Goring  was appointed to be his MajorGeneral But  Goring  wrote to his Lordship desiring he might be excused for his Attendance upon the Army till it was rea∣dy to march that he might be present in his Garrison till some Fortifications were perfected that were necessary for that important Place Upon which the Lord  Kimbolton  prevailed with the Earl of  Essex  that  Goring  should not be sent for till they were ready to enter upon Action and at last upon several Instances from the Lord  Kimbolton  to General  Goring  to come away after several Excuses he told him he was advised by Counsel that it was dange∣rous to leave the Place without the King's Leave having received the Command of that Place from him Hereby the King received a consi∣derable Reputation that so important a Place as  Portsmouth  with so considerable an Officer as Collonel  Goring  had declared for him But his declaring before the King was ready or the Garrison in Condition to sustain a Siege was the Cause of the King's Resolution of setting up his Standard and the Loss of  Portsmouth  which soon happened gave a great Disorder to the King's Affairs For the Parliament sent forthwith to besiege it and  Goring  was obliged to surrender it upon very good Articles for himself going into  France  with the Money he  had received on both Sides without making good his Promise to either But this his Car∣riage was much resented by all the King's Friends and more particularly by those who were expelled the House If his Conscience and Integrity had equalled his Wit and Courage he had been one of the most eminent Men of the Age he lived in But he could not resist Temptations and was a Man without Scruple and loved no Man so well but he would cozen him and afterwards laugh at him as he did at the Lord  Kimbolton  and of all his Qualifica∣tions which were many Dissimulation was his Masterpiece in which he so much excelled with his great Dexterity seeming Modesty and Unaffectedness that in this Concern of  Ports∣mouth  he cozened the House of Commons twice where were many Persons not easily to be deceived neither were they ashamed to be cozened twice by him who was so perfect a Master in that Art of Deceiving  Upon this Incident the King published a Declaration wherein all the insolent and re∣bellious Actions of both Houses were recited forbidding all his Subjects from paying any Obedience to them and requiring all that could bear Arms to be present to serve him at  Nottingham  the th of  August  following on which Day he intended to set up his Royal Stan∣dard where all his good Subjects were obliged to attend Many thought his Majesty had better have set it up at  York  But the Inclina∣tion the King had to be near  London  and his  Hopes of great Effects from  Portsmouth  which proved vain made him prefer  Notingham  and the Earl of  Cumberland  was left Commander in Chief of  Yorkshire  assisted with Sir  Thomas Glemham  Most Persons in  Yorkshire  were very faithful to the King except the Lord  Fairfax  and his Son who were to be made Prisoners the Seizing of them had probably prevented the Mischief which soon after broke out in those Parts but the King being always ill ill advised could not admit they should be made Prisoners The King came to  Nottingham  some Days before his Standard was set up and hearing some Regiments by Order from the Earl of  Essex  were marching to  Coventry  the King hastened thither with some Troops of Horse well armed and got thither the Day before the Parliament's Forces However the Gates were shut against him and some of his Servants kill'd from the Walls The King had no Remedy for this Affront but lodged that Night at  Stonely Abbey  at Sir  Thomas Lee  's The next Day the King's Body of Horse being near the Enemy at  Southam  who were not above Twelve Hundred Foot with one Troop of Horse in a free Campagne yet they retired without being charged Commissary  Wilmot  then commanded the King's Horse and several Reflections were made upon his not charging them About this time I was with the Earl of  Northampton  at  Warwick  having left  Coventry  some Months before where I resided with my Father being then very young and went with two Horses  and one of his Men to the Earl of  Northam∣pton  who was Lord Lieutenant of  Warwick∣shire  with whom I was when he first put the Commission of Array in Execution at  Coleshill  eight Miles from  Coventry  towards  Bermingham  From thence we went to  Warwick  in Hopes to have surprized that Castle but Sir  Edward Peito  was gotten into it before and had Orders to keep it for the Lord  Brook  whose Castle it was and his Lordship was then employed by the Par∣liament to settle the Militia in  Warwickshire  The Castle was strong and well scituated the River  Avon  running by it Our Endeavours for taking it were to little Purpose for we had only two small Pieces of Cannon which were brought from  Compton House  belonging to the Earl of  Northampton  and those were drawn up to the Top of the Church Steeple and were discharged at the Castle to which they could do no Hurt but only frighted them within the Castle who shot into the Street and killed several of our Men The King as I said before being repul∣sed from  Coventry  hastened back towards  Not∣tingham  and the Earl of  Essex  drawing near us with his Army being then at  Southam  my Lord of  Northampton  with his Troop of Gentlemen which were numerous marched towards  Wor∣cester  where we met Prince  Rupert  with some Troops of Horse with whom we joined and drew up in the Fields not far from  Powych  Bridge upon the  Severn  where we stood very quietly for some time being informed that the Earl of  Essex  was marching after us We had  not been long in this Posture before some Troops of Horse commanded by Collonel  Nathaniel Fiennes  who lay on the other Side  Powych  Bridge expecting to meet the Vanguard of  Essex  's Army passed the Bridge and having passed the Defiles he drew up his Troops not far from ours which the Prince gave him Time to do but then the Prince charged and routed them and sent them back over the Bridge in great Confusion and Disorder In this Action we took several Prisoners amongst whom was one Collonel  Sandys  who was mortally woun∣ded and died some Hours after Major  Dou∣glass  and several others were killed upon the Place This was the first Action I was ever in and being upon an unruly Horse he ran away with me amongst the Enemy while we pursued them to the Bridge in which Hurly I lost my Hat but my Horse's Courage being somewhat abated I stopp'd him before we came to the Bridge and so returned with our own Troops We retired that Evening into the City of  Wor∣cester  where being refreshed we marched that Night towards  Ludlow  where we stayed some time and from thence we went to  Shrewsbury  where we stay'd till the King came thither with his Army which much increased in those Quarters by several Regiments newly raised in those Parts for the King The next Day after our leaving  Worcester  the Earl of  Essex  came thither with his Army and made that City his Head Quarters for some time The King stay'd at  Shrewsbury  till his Army was well recruited  and then Resolutions were taken to march to∣wards  London  in Hopes to get thither before the Earl of  Essex  who was then with the Par∣liament Army about  Worcester  and  Warwick  While the King stay'd about  Shrewsbury  his Army was modelled into several Regiments of Horse Foot and Dragoons which in all made a considerable Body The Horse were put into several Brigades the Foot into Tertia's as they were then called and we had Three or Four Regiments of Dragoons Our chief Want was Arms for most of the Regiments which were raised in  Wales  were very ill armed However they were brave and resolute to serve their King with such Arms as they had or could get in their March and our Army increa∣sed daily by many coming to us from all Parts as we marched From  Shrewsbury  we marched thro' Part of  Staffordshire  and  Warwickshire  I was then with the Earl of  Northampton  in his own Troop which consisted of One Hun∣dred Gentlemen of Quality The Lord  Com∣pton  eldest Son to the Earl was the Right∣hand Man Sir  Charles Compton  his second Son was Cornet and Mr  Arden  a Gentleman of one of the most ancient Families in  War∣wickshire  was Lieutenant to the Earl We were then put into the Prince of  Wales  's Re∣giment of Horse which consisted of six gallant Troops besides the Servants The Prince of  Wales  's own Troop commanded by Sir  Thomas Byron  who was Collonel of the Regiment with Sir  Thomas Daniel  Lieutenant and Mr  Mettham  of  Yorkshire  Cornet The Duke of  York  's Troop commanded by the Lord  Aubigny  Brother to the Duke of  Richmond  The Earl of  Newcastle  's Troop commanded by his Bro∣ther Collonel  Cavendish  The Earl of  Lindsey  's Troop commanded by his Son the Lord  Willoughby  of  Eresby  The Earls of  Northam∣pton  and  Westmoreland  commanded each their own Troop and all the Servants of the whole Regiment were put into one Troop comman∣ded by Captain  Davison  an old experienced LowCountry Soldier who was recommended for that Employ by the old Earl of  Nor∣thampton  We marched thro' a great Part of  Warwick∣shire  and came under  Wormington  Hills on  Saturday  in the Evening the Twenty Second Day of  October  The King lodged that Night at Sir  William Chancie  's at  Ratott  Bridge and Prince  Rupert  at the Lord  Spen∣cer  's at  Wormleighton  The Prince of  Wales  's Regiment in which we were was quartered in two or three Villages under  Wormington  Hills When it was dark we saw several Fires not far from us and sending out a Party to see we were soon informed that the Earl of  Essex  was there with his whole Army and quartered at  Keinton  a MarketTown Whereupon our whole Regiment drew into the Fields and had Provi∣sions brought us from the Villages and we forthwith gave Notice to the King and Prince  Rupert  and soon after we received Orders to be upon our Guard all Night and to be the  next Morning by Eight at the Rendezvous upon  Wormington  Hills The King with the Prince of  Wales  and Duke of  York  came soon after and Prince  Rupert  who called a general Council of War where it was debated whether to march towards  London  or to march back and fight the Enemy whom we saw from the Hill embattelling their Army in the Bottom near  Keinton  To march from them was thought dishonourable as if we feared them and they would be sure to follow and give us continual Trouble in our March when we should not perhaps find so good Occasion to fight them and so it was resolved that we should go down the Hill and attack them Whereupon great Preparations were made and Precautions taken for descending the Hill which was very steep and long and had been impracticable if the Enemy had drawn nearer to the Bottom of it but we saw by the Ranging their Army that they intended to stay there for us having a good Market Town by them and not far from  Warwick  In the first Place it was resolved that Collonel  Washington  with his Regiment of Dragoons should descend the Hill and possess some Inclosures and Briars on the right Hand of our Army and a forlorn Hope of Six Hun∣dred Horse were ordered likewise to descend be∣fore the Army and the Carriage Horses of the Cannon were put behind the Carriages excepting a Horse or two before and the Foot were orde∣red to descend as well as they could The King was that Day in a black Velvet Coat lin'd  with Ermin and a Steel Cap covered with Vel∣vet He rode to every Brigade of Horse and to all the Tertia's of Foot to encourage them to their Duty being accompanied by the great Officers of the Army His Majesty spoke to them with great Courage and Chearfulness which caused Huzza's thro' the whole Army I take the Liberty here to remember one Pas∣sage which was remarkable It seems that very Morning before the Army descended the Hill the Duke of  Lenox  being returned from his Travels waited then upon the King by whom his Grace was very well received and caressed He brought with him one Mr  Scroop  who had accompanied him After this Gentle∣man had kissed the King's Hand as also that of the Prince of  Wales  and Duke of  York  the Duke of  Lenox  told the King that the Gen∣tleman's Father was Sir  Gervase Scroop  who had a good Estate had raised a Foot Regiment in  Lincolnshire  to serve his Majesty and was then in the Army but very angry with his Son and would not see him or be reconciled to him because he went with the Duke of  Lenox  without his Father's Consent and had spent much more Money than he allowed him The Duke of  Lenox  therefore prayed the King to make them Friends Whereupon the King sent for the Father and told him it was his Plea∣sure he should be reconciled to his Son who being then present demanded upon his Knees his Father's Blessing whereupon the Father gave it him and said thus to his Son  I am  now going down the Hill to serve the King and if I be killed I have left you my Son enough to spend  And the Son presently answered  And if I be killed I shall leave you enough to pay for me  And so the Father and Son went down the Hill together and it so happened that the Son saved his Father's Life who ha∣ving received many Wounds was stript and left for dead and was brought off the next Morning by his Son in one of the King's Coaches who lived some Years after always very kind to his Son and left him a very good Estate I have presumed to add this Particular because I have had great Obligations to that Family and upon King  Charles  II's Restora∣tion he was made Knight of the  Bath  by the Name of Sir  Adrian Scroop  And I was then one of the Gentlemen that brought him to the King when his Majesty put the Red Ribband about him But leaving this Digression let us turn again to the King's Army which about Ten in the Morning began to descend the Hill the Foot getting down several Ways which the Horse could not do by reason of the Hill's Steepness When the whole Army was down and drawn into Order the King desired the Earl of  Lindsey  who was his Lieutenant General that he would permit General  Ruthen  an old  Scotch  Officer and who had long served under  Gustavus Adolphus  the late King of  Sweden  and had been a Lieutenant General in his Ar∣my to draw up his Majesty's Army that Day and to command it being an old experienced  General to which the Earl of  Lindsey  being wholly made of Obedience willingly complied and said he would serve the King that Day as Collonel of the King's Royal Regiment of Foot Guards which he did accompanied by his Son the Lord  Willoughby  of  Eresby  The Enemy had all the Morning to draw up their Army in a great plain Field which they did to their best Advantage by putting several Bodies of Foot with Retrenchments and Can∣non before them and all their Foot were lined with Horse behind them with Intervals betwixt each Body for their Horse to enter if need required and upon their right Wing were some Briars covered with Dragoons and a little be∣hind on their left Wing was the Town of  Keinton  which supplied them with Provisions and where their Baggage and Carriages were  Our whole Army was drawn up in a Body the Horse Three deep in each Wing and the Foot in the Center Six deep The Prince of  Wales  's Regiment was on the right Wing which was commanded by Prince  Rupert  and Collo∣nel  Washington  was with his Dragoons upon our Right In the Center was the Infantry com∣manded in chief by General  Ruthen  and un∣der him by Sir  Jacob Astley  The Earl of  Lindsey  marched on Foot in the Head of the Regiment of the Royal Foot Guards with his Son the Lord  Willoughby  and Sir  Edmond Verney  carried the Royal Standard The left Wing of our Horse was commanded by Com∣missary General  Wilmot  with Collonel  Fielding  and some other principal Officers and Collonel  George Lisle  with Lieutenant Collonel  Ennis  were in the left Wing with a Regiment of Dra∣goons to defend the Briars on that Side and we had a Body of Reserve of Six Hundred Horse commanded by the Earl of  Carnarvon  When our Army was drawn up at the Foot of the Hill and ready to march all the Generals went to the King who intended to march with the Army and desi∣red he would retire to a rising Ground some Di∣stance from thence on the Right with the Prince of  Wales  and Duke of  York  having his Guard of Pensioners on Horseback with him from whence he might see the Issue of the Battle and be out of Danger and that otherwise the Army would not advance towards the Enemy To which the King very unwillingly was at last perswaded  Just before we began our March Prince  Rupert  passed from one Wing to the other gi∣ving positive Orders to the Horse to march as close as was possible keeping their Ranks with Sword in Hand to receive the Enemy's Shot without firing either Carbin or Pistol till we broke in amongst the Enemy and then to make use of our FireArms as need should require which Order was punctually observed The Enemy stayed to receive us in the same Po∣sture as was formerly declared and when we came within Cannon Shot of the Enemy they discharged at us three Pieces of Cannon from their left Wing commanded by Sir  James Ram∣sey  which Cannon mounted over our Troops without doing any Hurt except that their se∣cond  Shot killed a QuarterMaster in the Rear of the Duke of  York  's Troop We soon after engaged each other and our Dragoons on our Right beat the Enemy from the Briars and Prince  Rupert  led on our right Wing so furi∣ously that after a small Resistance we forced their left Wing and were Masters of their Can∣non and the Prince being extreamly eager of this Advantage which he better knew how to take than to keep was not content with their Cannon and keeping their Ground but eager∣ly pursued the Enemy who fled on the other Side of  Keinton  towards  Warwick  And we of the Prince of  Wales  's Regiment who were all scattered pursued also till we met with two Foot Regiments of  Hambden  and  Hollis  and with a Regiment of Horse coming from  Warwick  to their Army which made us hasten as fast back as we had pursued In this Pursuit I was wounded in the Head by a Person who turned upon me and struck me with his Poleaxe and was seconding his Blow when Sir  Thomas Byron  being near he shot him dead with his Pistol by which Means I came back In fine by meeting these three Regiments we were obli∣ged to return back to our Army and then found our great Error in leaving our Foot naked who were rudely handled by the Enemy's Horse and Foot together in our Absence who fell principally upon the King's Royal Regiment of Foot Guards who lost Eleven of Thirteen Colours the King's StandardBrearer Sir  Ed∣mond Verney  killed and the Royal Standard  taken which was presently retaken by Cap∣tain  John Smith  who was Knighted for it that Night by the King under the Standard Royal and made a Baronet with the usual Ceremonies and had afterwards a large Medal of Gold gi∣ven him with the King's Picture on the one Side and the Banner on the other which he always wore to his dying Day in a large green watered Ribband cross his Shoul∣ders He was afterwards killed at the Battle of  Alresford  in  Hampshire  in the Year which was called  Cheriton  Fight with the Lord  Bernard Stewart  Brother to the Duke of  Rich∣mond  and several others Sir  Robert Walsh  an  Irishman  who also pretended that he was very instrumental in regaining the Standard did also in the same Manner wear a green Rib∣band with a Medal but whether it was given him by Order or how he came by it I do not know tho' I have often seen him wear it In this Battle of  Edgehill  as it was always called during our Pursuit of the Enemy the Earl of  Lindsey  was mortally wounded and taken Pri∣soner with his Son the Lord  Willoughby  who killed the Man that wounded his Father who died in the Earl of  Essex  's Coach as he was carrying to  Warwick  Now when we returned from following the Enemy the Night came soon upon us whereas in all Probability we had gained the Victory and made an End of the War if we had only kept our Ground after we had beaten the Enemy and not left our Foot naked to their Horse and Foot And  to add to our Misfortune a careless Soldier in fetching Powder where a Magazin was clapt his Hand carelessly into a Barrel of Powder with his Match lighted betwixt his Fingers whereby much Powder was blown up and many kill'd The Night then soon parted both Armies and both Sides pretended to the Victory but since we retired up the Hill from whence we came down and left the  Champ de Battaile  to the Enemy I think we had no great Reason to brag of a Victory For the King with a great Part of the Army marched that Night up to  Wormington  Hills it being a hard Frost and very cold But that which made us think we had the Victory was that whereas the Earl of  Essex  was commanded to hinder our getting to  London  before him by this Battle we were nearest  London  and might have been there much before the Earl of  Essex  if we had taken right Measures So that it may be said of this Battle  Victus uterque fuit Victor uterque fuit  There is always great Difference in Relation of Battles which is usually according to the Interest of the Rela∣tors when it is certain that in a Battle the next Man can hardly make a true Relation of the Actions of him that is next him for in such a Hurry and Smoke as in a set Field a Man takes Notice of nothing but what relates to his own Safety So that no Man give a clear Account of particular Passages  On  Monday  Morning being next after the Battle several Parties were sent down to view  the Dead the greatest Part of the Enemy having retired in the Night to the Town of  Keinton  which was near them and Mr  Adrian Scroop  having seen his Father fall being much woun∣ded desired the Duke of  Lenox  to speak to the King that one of his Coaches might go with him to bring up his Father's Body which being granted he found his Father stript with several very dangerous Wounds and that he was alive Whereupon he lapt him up in his Cloak and brought him in the Coach where he was presently dressed by the King's Chirur∣geons and by their Care and Skill was cured and lived many Years after tho' he had seven∣teen Wounds and had died upon the Place but that the Coldness of the Weather stopp'd the Bleeding of his Wounds which saved also se∣veral other Mens Lives that were wounded We rested all  Monday  upon the Hill to put our Army in Order and seeing the Enemy as we thought were preparing to retire Prince  Rupert  was resolved that  Monday  Night to go down the Hill at a Place called  SunRising  a Mile on our left Hand and to fall upon the Enemy in their Retreat and on  Tuesday  Morning ve∣ry early the Prince with a strong Detatch∣ment of Horse and Dragoons fell into  Keinton  where he found all Houses full of wounded and sick Men with divers Officers and several Waggons loaded with Muskets and Pikes and all Sorts of Ammunition preparing to follow the Army which was marched towards  War∣wick  These Arms were extreamly wanting in  our Army and were a very good Supply for some Hundreds of  Welchmen  were so brave that they had no Arms but Pitchforks and such like Tools and many only with good Cudgels yet they went down the Hill as eagerly to fight as the best armed Men among them And in∣deed most of the Gentry in North  Wales  most willingly ingaged for the King and raised what Men they possibly could for his Service while the King stayed in  Shropshire  and the Gentry of that Country did in a most particular Man∣ner shew their Zeal for his Majesty's Service there being scarce a Family of any Consideration in any of those Counties that was not ingaged for the King as the  Salisburies  the  Mostyns  the  Trevors  the  Thelwells  and several others whose Families I have forgotten But this I certainly knew that none served the King with greater Loyalty and Affection than all the Gentry of North  Wales  wherein the Family of  Bulkeley  must not be forgotten who were always very eminent for the King's Service  After this Battle of  Edgehill  it was resolved the King should hasten to  London  and that if he could get thither before the Earl of  Essex  with his Army the King would be certainly well received and in all Probability make an End of the War of which the Parliament was in such Fear that several Expresses were sent to the Earl of  Essex  to make all possible Haste with his Army to  London  and prevent the King's Coming before him But our King trifled away his Time in taking  Banbury  and  Broughton House  which belonged to the Lord  Say  Places of very little Consideration and so marched very slowly towards  London  where the Earl of  Essex  with his Army arrived before him tho' the King's Army was much nearer  London  after the Battle of  Edgehill  if right Use had been made of it By Judgment of most the Victory in this Battle was the King's because he gain'd his Point a clear Passage for his Way to  London  of which the Parliament was so sensible that not only reiterated Orders were sent to hasten the Earl of  Essex  's March but all the Shops both in  London  and  Westmin∣ster  were shut up the next Day after the Battle that the People might be in a better Readiness to defend themselves and the Parliament  But alas the King retarded his March of which the Earl of  Essex  taking hold got be∣tween the King and  London  and in this our March towards  London  the Parliament sent a Petition to the King in a much humbler Strain than their former Messages to the King used to be which Petition the King liked well and re∣solved to reside at his Castle of  Windsor  there to receive the Parliament's Propositions But News being then brought to the King that  Essex  was advanced towards him and had possessed the Passes of  Windsor Kingston  and  Acton  and that if  Essex  should also take  Brentford  the King would be wholly surrounded and depri∣ved either of moving or subsisting Whereupon a Council of War was called and Resolutions taken that the King's Army should advance to  Brentford  where at the first we found con∣siderable Opposition The Prince of  Wales  's Regiment of Horse where I was being drawn up behind a great Hedge where the Enemy had planted some Cannon which we saw not till they played so fast upon us that we lost some Men and were obliged to draw off and retire for our better Security and upon our Foot's coming up we beat the Regiments of  Hambden  and  Hollis  out of the Town took several Prisoners and Arms and sunk two great Barks in the River of  Thames  with many Sol∣diers And as two other Regiments came up to their Succour they were also beaten and we took some Colours and Cannon and were in∣tire Masters of  Brentford  until the Night but then finding the Earl of  Essex  with his Army was drawn out upon  Turnham Green  with the Trained Bands of the City and that the Ene∣my's Army was double to the King's and that most of our Ammunition was spent it was therefore thought fit by the Council that the King should retreat Whereupon the King re∣tired that Night to the Lord  Cottington  's House near  Hounslow  and we marched the next Day by  Colebrook  towards  Reading  and  Oxford  the first of which Places was garrisoned and  Oxford  was the King's Head Quarters where he made his Residence I can give this Relation with Certainty being present in all that March and in the Actions at  Brentford  till the King's Return to  Oxford  and then the Earl of  Nor∣thampton  was commanded to  Banbury  which  was given him for Winter Quarters with Or∣ders to raise a Regiment of Horse  This Advance of the King's Army towards  London  when a Treaty of Peace was proposed both by the Parliament and the City of  London  in a milder Strain than they had ever done be∣fore was by many thought imprudent to make the Breach wider and divers Reflections were made upon it However the King sent Word to the Houses that he intended to settle his Court at such a Distance from them as might take away all Misapprehensions Hereupon the City petition the King professing their Grief for his Distrust of them and declare their Loy∣alty to him And the Parliament finding the general Inclinations of the People for Peace resolved to send some Propositions to the King which not being accepted the Treaty was soon broken off But then another Treaty was pro∣posed in  March  following and new Commissi∣oners named which were only the Earl of  Northumberland  with four of the House of Commons who had free Access to the King who used them with great Civility and Favour and treated personally with them because their Instructions were very strict and tied them up to treat with none but the King himself where they often attended and had Access at all Times when they desired it and were allowed a very free Debate with his Majesty In this Trea∣ty the King shewed his great Parts and Abilities Strength of Reason and Quickness of Appre∣hension with much Patience hearing what was  objected against him wherein he allowed the Commissioners all Freedom and when he dif∣fered from them in Opinion he would tell them by your Favour my Lord  Northumber∣land  who was the chief of the Commissioners I am not of your Opinion or I think other∣wise and would himself sum up their Argu∣ments and give a clear Judgment upon them The King's great Unhappiness was that he had a better Opinion of others Judgment than of his own tho' weaker than his own and of this these Commissioners at that time had a sad Experience to their great Trouble  It seems in this Treaty they so pressed his Majesty with their best Reasons and Arguments to grant what they desired that the King was so fully satisfied with their Reasons that he abso∣lutely agreed to what they proposed and promi∣sed to give them their Answer the next Morning according to their Desires but because it was then late and past Midnight he deferred to give his Answer in Writing till the next Morning and commanded them to wait upon him accor∣dingly The Commissioners hereupon went to their Lodging full of Joy in Hopes to receive the Answer agreed upon but instead of what they expected and was promised by the King he gave them a Paper quite contrary to what was concluded between them the Night before The Commissioners did most humbly expostu∣late with his Majesty and pressed him upon his Royal Word and the ill Consequences they feared would follow upon this new Paper To  which the King told them he had altered his Mind and that the Paper he gave them was his Answer which he was resolved to make upon their last Debate and they could obtain no other Answer from him which gave them much Sadness and Trouble After this sad Rencoun∣ter which the Commissioners did not expect they enquired of some of the King's particular Counsellours how the King came to change his Mind who said that after the King had left his Council and was undressing some of those Gentlemen about him whose Interest was for Continuance of the War and hearing what Answer the King had promised never left pressing the King till they had perswaded and prevailed with him to change his former Reso∣lution and to order his Answer to be drawn as then delivered which being intimated to the Commissioners they used their utmost En∣deavours to disswade the King from sending this Answer fearing it would break the Treaty but they could not prevail the Answer was sent and upon the Parliament's receiving it they fortwith recalled their Commissioners and the Treaty ended unsuccessfully having lasted from the Beginning of  March  till the Middle of  April  This Relation I had from one of the Commissioners my Cousin German who I am sure wished well to the King and desired no∣thing more than a good Peace between the King and his People And this Gentleman was after accused in the House of Commons by a Lord who was at the Time of the Treaty with the  King in  Oxford  but soon after deserted the King and went to the Parliament and accused that Commissioner to have had several private Conferences with the King unknown to the rest of the Commissioners and if that Person had not been powerfully supported and high∣ly defended by Mr  Denzell Hollis  who was also a Commissioner that other Person had been ruined by that Lord's false Accusation who quite lost his Reputation by it Thus we see a good King was unhappily misled by those about him which caused him often to refuse those things to which he should chearfully have consented and freely have condescended to many things which he should have denied to the last It is certain a Prince should esteem nothing more precious than his Word nothing more sacred than his Promise which made  Francis  I of  France  say That if Faith was to∣tally banished out of the World it should be found in his Word Indeed a Prince should be careful of promising any thing that may be of Damage to him and where the Thing pro∣mised cannot without good Reason bind to the Performance and whether what the King pro∣mised to those Commissioners were of that sort I will not undertake to determine  When the King had settled his Court at  Oxford  recruited his Army and fortified his Garrisons in all Parts he gave  Banbury  and that Part of the Country to the Earl of  Nor∣thampton  who was commanded to raise a Re∣giment of Horse which was given to the Lord  Compton  his eldest Son and Sir  Charles  his second Son was made Lieutenant Collonel of it To Sir  William Compton  his third Son was given the Castle of  Banbury  One Troop in his Regiment of Horse was given to Captain  James Chamberlain  Brother to Sir  Thomas  who was then High Sheriff of  Oxfordshire  To Captain  James Chamberlain  were given the two Villages of Upper and Lower  Heigford  opposite to  North  and  Steeple Aston  in  Oxfordshire  for his Quarters while he raised the said Company Mr  Herbert Jeffries  of  Herefordshire  was his Lieutenant and I was his Cornet This Com∣pany was soon raised and the first Time the Captain went out with it he was killed near  Northampton  by one Captain  Lawson  About the same time Mr  Herbert Jeffries  was sent for by his Uncle Sir  Herbert Price  upon Mr  Jef∣fries  's Father being drowned in passing the Ri∣ver  Wye  Whereupon Mr  Jeffries  came no more back and the Troop of Horse fell to my Lot where I continued not long for the Lord  Wentworth  who was MajorGeneral of the Horse by the Death of Sir  Thomas Byron  was also made Collonel of the Prince of  Wales  's Regiment and being very inquisitive to find out a young active Man to be his Adjutant I was recommended to his Lordship by Mr  Hat∣ton Farmer  Son to Sir  William Farmer  of  Eu∣ston  in  Northamptonshire  who was at that time Cornet to the Prince of  Wales  The great Dif∣ficulty was whether I should quit my Troop to be his Lordship's Adjutant To which I was  advised by many assuring me by that Employ∣ment I should know more of the War in one Year than being a Captain all my Lifetime and so I quitted my Company with the good Will of the Earl of  Northampton  after I had been at the Battle of  Middleton Cheney  near  Banbury  where we beat the Parliament Troops Upon the quitting my Troop Mr  George Chamberlain  another Brother of Sir  Thomas  was made Captain of it and I had not been long with my Lord  Wentworth  before my Lord  Wilmot  being Lieutenant General of the Horse desired me to be his Adjutant which his Lord∣ship could not refuse the Lord  Wilmot  being his superior General Officer and in that Sta∣tion I remained with my Lord  Wilmot  to his great Satisfaction till his Disgrace in  Cornwall  as shall be said hereafter  During this Year I was Adjutant to my Lord  Wilmot  when he defeated  Waller  at  RoundwayDown  near the  Devizes  took his Cannon Ammunition and Baggage with some Foot Colours and Standards and  Wallet  himself escaped to  Bristol  By this Loss of  Waller  's the King was Master of all the West  Bristol  and  Exeter  being soon after delivered and if the King had then marched to  London  he had in all Probability made an End of the War But he was ill if not maliciously perswaded to besiege  Gloucester  which was the only Place left to the Parliament in these Parts The King had Intentions of Storming it but fear∣ing to lose the best Part of his Infantry in that  Action and being assured it could not be re∣lieved made the King lose much Time and the Opportunity of taking it For the Earl of  Essex  soon raised an Army in  London  for its Relief to prevent which Prince  Rupert  and the Lord  Wilmot  were sent with all the Horse to stop his Passage or at least to retard his March through  Oxfordshire  And tho' the Prince had then a brave Army and was most commonly in a Race Campagne and that we still marched before  Essex  to eat up the Provisions and to attend his Motions yet we took no Advantage of him nor was his Design of raising the Siege of  Gloucester  prevented tho' it was then in the last Extremity When  Essex  came upon the Brow of the Hills not far distant from  Glou∣cester  he discharged some Cannon to give them Notice of his Coming and the King hereupon raised the Siege without any Loss or Impeach∣ment from the Town Thus when the King's Affairs were in a prosperous Condition he trifled away Time to no Purpose in that unfor∣tunate Siege When  Essex  had put the City of  Gloucester  in Order and left them Cannon and Ammunition he marched unexpectedly to  Tewksbury  which he surprized and sent from thence great Stores of all Sorts of Provision which the King sent thither from his Camp and  Essex  likewise took in  Tewksbury  two Re∣giments of Horse with divers Officers com∣manded by Sir  Nicholas Crisp  from whence he marched towards  London  by the way of  Hun∣gerford  and  Newbury  where was the first  New∣bury  Fight but since I was not present in that Battle I will not pretend to give a Relation of it Only this I may say truly that we staked there Pearls against Pebbles and lost some Men there of great Consideration tho' the Enemy lost more Soldiers and were obliged to quit their Station and in this Year the King was so successful that the Parliament began to despair and the prevailing Party in the House of Commons were ready to truss up Bag and Baggage But  Essex  's Success at  Gloucester  chan∣ged the Scene of publick Affairs and the King returned to  Oxford  It was about this time that the Earls of  Bedford  and  Holland  deserted the Parliament and came to  Oxford  to submit themselves to the King But they not being received nor countenanced as they expected they both returned again to the Parliament When the King ought most certainly to have received them well and to have used them kindly for Encouragement to others But our unfortunate Prince was still advised to take false Measures in Affairs that most nearly concer∣ned him Upon their first Coming there was a Debate in Council by the King's Order how they should be received Some thought his Ma∣jesty should receive them very graciously and with kind Expressions of his Acceptance of their Return to his Service and that the Behaviour of all others towards them should be such as might make them think themselves very wel∣come without taking Notice of any thing for∣merly done amiss by them But others of a  contrary Judgment would not have them ad∣mitted into the King's Presence Betwixt these Extremes others were of Opinion they should neither be neglected nor courted but admitted to kiss the King and Queen's Hands But the Reason of old  Fabius  ought to have been consi∣dered which he gave in the Case of  Cossius Altinius  who after the Battle of  Cannae  de∣serted the  Romans  and fled to  Hannibal  and when the Condition of the  Romans  mended he came again to them Hereupon many thought he should be esteemed as a common Enemy and sent back to  Hannibal  as a perfidious Person but  Fabius  reprehended their Severity as unrea∣sonable who judged in the Heat of War as in the Time of Peace and told them their chief Care ought to be that none of their Friends should forsake them and next that they who had forsaken them might return to their Obedience and Protection and be well used Which Method should have been taken with these two Earls which had prevented their Return and encouraged others to follow them  But it was the unhappy Temper of those who were often called to Council in this King's Time that Resolutions taken upon full Debate were seldom prosecuted with equal Resolution but often changed upon new and short Debates and many Counsellours were irresolute and un∣constant and full of Objections which much hindred good Resolutions And the great Mis∣fortune was that the King most commonly  considered more the Person that spoke as he was in his Grace or Prejudice than the Coun∣sel it self and always suspected or at least trusted less to his own Judgment than he ought to have done which rarely deceived him so much as that of other Men And if in the Case aforementioned he had followed his own Judgment he had received and used those Lords very kindly But at this time the King's Affairs were in a flourishing Condition and it was the unlucky Temper of the King's Party to be the most desperately cast down upon the least ill Success and upon any good to be the most elated and therefore were of Opinion against receiving those Lords with any Civility believing they returned to the King because the Parliament's Affairs were at that time but in a tottering Condition  The King having successfully settled military Affairs the last Year and the Parliament fear∣ing a farther Encrease of them called to their Assistance their Brethren the  Scots  in Pursu∣ance of their wicked League and Covenant which second Voyage of theirs into  England  brought that Deluge of Mischiefs which after∣wards followed for in the Beginning of the Year the King's Affairs begun to change Face for  Essex  and  Waller  were soon recruited at  London  and by the Help of other associa∣ted Counties they raised two powerful Armies marched into  Oxfordshire  hovering about the King's Head Quarters who not liking such Neighbours had a Mind to draw them from  thence and therefore left  Oxford  Upon this the Enemy was ordered to follow the King leaving his evil Counsellours unmolested in  Oxford  contrary to what they had always till then pretended that their Design was only to remove the evil Counsellours but now it plainly appeared that their Design was against the King's sacred Person since both Armies followed him which being too great to conti∣nue long together they separated and  Essex  was perswaded by the Lord  Roberts  and others to reduce the Western Counties to the Obedi∣ence of the Parliament and that  Waller  with his Army should attend the King's Motions who was marching as the Enemy thought to∣wards  Wales  But the King gave  Waller  the Goby and having gotten before him was marching to  Daventry  in great Diligence ha∣ving left a strong Guard of Dragoons at  Cro∣predy  Bridge a Pass over the  Charwell  between both Armies  Waller  being on the other Side the River waiting the King and perceiving the Guard was drawn off from  Cropredy  Bridge and that the Van of the King's Army was much before their Rear the Van having marched faster than was necessary so that the Rear of the King's were but then come to their Ren∣dezvous and were not advanced so far as the Bridge which the King's Guard had quitted  Waller  taking this Advantage passed over a great Part of his Army at this Bridge under the Command of Collonel  Weems  who was General of the Artillery with several Cannon  of  Weems  's Invention being more easy of Car∣riage and this great Detachment of  Waller  's Army was drawn up just in the Way where the Rear of the King's Army was to pass which was commanded by the old Earl of  Cleveland  who was of Necessity obliged to fight the Ene∣my before he could get to the Van of the King's Army the whole Army of  Waller  being drawn up on the other Side the River to pass the Bridge in Case  Weems  succeeded of which  Waller  doubted not having passed over many more Troops than the Earl of  Cleveland  had in the Rear However the Earl behaved him∣self so well in that Engagement that after a very sharp Dispute the Enemy was beaten and forced over  Cropredy  Bridge to join their Army Many were killed upon the Place and many Prisoners taken with all their Cannon and Ammunition and amongst the Prisoners  Weems  a  Scot  and the King's sworn Servant being made MasterGunner of  England  a con∣siderable Employment and besides he had a good Sum of Money given him for the Inven∣tion of making those Leather Cannon After the Battle he was was brought before the King and had the Impudence to tell his Majesty in his  Scotch  Tone That in good Faith his Heart was always towards his Majesty This Victory was not obtained without some Loss on our Side for Sir  William Boteler  and Sir  WilWilliam Clark  both Collonels of Horse were killed and much regretted being brave Men We had there a Regiment of Dragoons com∣manded  by Collonel  Hooper  who signalized himself upon this Occasion so well that tho' he was of a mean Education and small Extra∣ction yet such particular Notice was taken of him by the Earl of  Cleveland  who gave so good an Account of his Service that Day that the King gave him the Honour of Knighthood by the Name of Sir  Thomas Hooper  to encou∣rage others to follow his Example This De∣feat made  Waller  hasten to  London  for Recruits and the King taking Advantage of his Retreat turned again with his Army and marched with great Diligence after the Earl of  Essex  who was gone into the West  While the King was upon his March he had an Account that  York  was besieged by the  Scots  who were joined with  Fairfax  and  Man∣chester  upon which Information the King sent Orders to Prince  Rupert  to join with the Mar∣quess of  Newcastle  's Army to raise that Siege which the Prince did but not content with that he would needs follow the Enemy with whom he fought upon  MarstonMoor  four Miles from  York  and had defeated the Enemy disordered their main Battle possess'd their Cannon and forced their three Generals out of the Field but being too furious in pursuing his Advantage and his Soldiers too busy in Pillaging  Cromwell  who then commanded the Horse under  Manchester  having rallied toge∣ther some Troops charged the Prince and pressed him so hard that he changed the whole Fortune of the Day and forced the Prince to a  disorderly Flight and gained an entire Victory and took Prisoners Major General  George Porter  Sir  Charles Lucas  Collonel  Tybiard  and seve∣ral others This Defeat was infinitely preju∣dicial to the King's Affairs in the North the Loss of  York  soon following it and many Re∣flections were made upon the Prince's Fighting which he should not have done his Business only having been to raise the Siege of  York  Hereupon the Marquess of  Newcastle  with several other eminent Officers in the North being highly dissatisfied with the Prince quit∣ted  England  and went to  Hamburgh  whereby the whole North was soon after lost The King having received an Account of this De∣feat in his March hastened the more after  Essex  and being come into a Race Campagne in  Cornwal  three or four Miles only from the Ene∣my and General  Goring  being newly come from the North after the Defeat of  MarstonMoor  and was then with the King in the Head of his Army the Van of which was that Day commanded by the Lord  Wentworth  Major General and the Lord  Wilmot  Lieutenant General brought up the Rear of the Army with his own Brigade and being ready to go to Prayers Mr  Elliot  of the King's Bedcham∣ber came to his Lordship and told him the King would speak with him To which the Lord  Wilmot  replied  You see I am just going to Prayers I will serve God first and then I shall serve the King the better after and will presently wait upon the King after Prayers  Which being ended as his Lordship was mar∣ching up to the King Sir  Edward Sydenham  KnightMarshal came riding down the Hill with several Gentlemen and told the Lord  Wilmot  that the King commanded him to be his Prisoner His Lordship being somewhat surprized with this Message turned his Horse and I asked him what Service he would com∣mand me To which his Lordship presently replied  I can command you nothing being a Prisoner but I pray you acquaint the Lord  Wentworth  with my present Condition  which I did who was much surprized with it and so were all the other General Officers to whom I told it and they all concluded it was the Ef∣fect of General  Goring  's coming to the King The Lord  Wentworth  forthwith alighted with several other principal Officers to consider what Measures to take in so sudden and unex∣pected a Change and were all much unsatisfied believing General  Goring  to be the Cause of whom they had no good Opinion since his Examination in Parliament at the Beginning of the War when he was Governour of  Ports∣mouth  which he soon delivered and made good Conditions for his going into  France  after he had received Money on both Sides and resto∣red to neither Upon this Consideration the General Officers of Horse were so far from be∣ing satisfied with the Change that they pre∣sently drew up an Address to the King which was penned by Mr  Adrian Scroop  the Substance of which was as I well remember as followeth  That they the Lord  Wentworth  and other Ge∣neral Officers of the Army having had the Honourlong to serve his Majesty under the Command of the Lord  Wilmot  were so well and intimately acquainted with all his Concerns relating to the Army that they were confident he could be guilty of no Crime but what they must know and that finding his Lordship suddenly disgraced and fallen into his Majesty's Displeasure they there∣fore most humbly begged his Majesty would gra∣ciously please to let them know what Fault the Lord  Wilmot  had committed that they might free themselves from it or most humbly implore the King's Pardon for it  This Address was presented to the King by the Lord  Wentworth  accompanied with several General Officers and others of the Army I was then present when the King having first read the Address to him∣self gave this verbal Answer which I heard the King say  That if the Lord  Wilmot  had continued to command his Army of Horse his Crown could not have long stood upon his Head  and he assured the Lord  Wentworth  and those Officers with him that when the Business was over with the Earl of  Essex  with whom he was now engaged we should all know what Fault the Lord  Wilmot  had committed That in the  Interim  his Majesty was well satisfied of their Loyalty who had presented that Address and commanded them to go to their several Brigades and Regiments and to obey General  Goring  whom he had made General of all his Cavalry  Hereupon General  Goring  went to the Head of the Horse to command a Thousand to be drawn out but not finding the Lord  Went∣worth  nor the Adjutant General he returned to the King and complained he could find no General Officer or Adjutant to draw out a Party Whereupon the King asked for me who every Night brought his Majesty the List of the Quarters and sent  Tomkins  an Equerry to find me and bring me to his Majesty which he soon did and the King commanded me to go with General  Goring  and obey his Orders And accordingly I forthwith drew out a De∣tachment of One Thousand Horse under the Conduct of Collonel  Richard Nevil  of  Billing∣beer  in  Berkshire  The General was pleased with my Diligence in so soon drawing out the Detachment and commanded me to come with him and told me he made me that Day his Adjutant and that I being the first Man that the King had recommended to him he would take particular Care of me and assured me that whenever Collonel  Scrimsour  an old  Scotch∣man  that was AdjutantGeneral died he would make me AdjutantGeneral which hap∣pened soon after and then I was made Adju∣tantGeneral of all the Horse that were or should be raised in the Kingdom of  England  Dominion of  Wales  and the Town of  Berwick  upon  Tweed  for so my Commission ran But leaving this Digression I must not omit to tell that General  Goring  being advanced to the Top of the Hill about two Miles before our Army  had there a perfect View of the Enemy who were then about  Lestwythiel  He stopp'd then and sent me back in great Haste to the King to tell him in what Posture the Enemy was desiring the King to advance with his Army without Delay and that he would make good the Post where he was which would be very advantageous for his Majesty's Army In the mean time that I went from General  Goring  to the King he commanded Collonel  Nevil  to send a Party towards  Buconnock  the Lord  Mohun  's House where perhaps a further Dis∣covery might be made of the Enemy Where∣upon Collonel  Nevil  sent out a Party under the Command of Monsieur  Gascoigne  a  Florentine  who meeting some CountryMen he asked them if they knew any thing of the Enemy Who told him if he made Haste to the Lord  Mohun  's House he would find there some of the Parlia∣ment Officers at Dinner not believing the King's Army was so near them Whereupon the Party hastened thither and surprized se∣veral Officers whom they brought Prisoners for which Service and some others after he was Knighted and known by the Name of Sir  Bernard Gascoigne  and was made Major to General  Goring  's Regiment of Horse and served not only to the End of the War in very good Esteem but was also at the Rising in  Essex  and condemned to be shot to Death at  Colche∣ster  with Sir  Charles Lucas  and Sir  George Lisle  but being a Foreigner he was reprieved and saved And now I will tell the Reasons  why I appointed Collonel  Nevil  to command this Detachment of a Thousand Horse tho' it was not his Turn to go Whilst the Address from the Lord  Wentworth  and the General Officers was making to the King his Lordship commanded me to go to such Collonels of Horse in the Army to desire their Agreeing and Sign∣ing to the Address And when I told Collonel  Nevil  of it he said he was as great a Servant to the Lord  Wilmot  and had as good an Opi∣nion of him as any Person in the Army well knowing that his Lordship had long and faith∣fully served the King but yet whoever the King should set over him he would obey And added that he thought not fit at that Time especially to dispute the King's Commands when they were going to attack the Enemy and that therefore he would have no Hand in the Address and desired the Lord  Wentworth  to excuse him And it was upon this Considera∣tion that I chose Collonel  Nevil  to command that Detachment tho' I knew it was not his Turn to go in which he acted to the Gene∣ral's great Satisfaction who had ever after a great Esteem and Value for him  At my Return to the King with the Message of General  Goring  the King forthwith marched with his Army towards him who not only made good the Post where he was but upon the Earl of  Brentford  's drawing and advancing farther who then commanded the Army in chief under the King and reviewing the Sci∣tuation of  Essex  's Army which then began to  retire towards  Foy  the King's Army did there∣upon advance nearer the Enemy and the King's General Head Quarters were settled at  Bucon∣nock  the Lord  Mohun  's House and Sir  Richard Greenvil  was ordered with some Regiments of Foot to fix them at the Lord  Roberts  's House a strong Quarters opposite to the King's on the other Side the Valley at the Head of which Valley a strong Guard of Horse was ordered to be constantly kept to keep in the Enemy our whole Army being encamped on both Sides the Valley which prevented the Enemy from making any Excursion that Way But because the rest of  Cornwal  behind the Enemy was open it was thought necessary to send a strong Detachment thither to stop their Passage on that Side Whereupon General  Goring  was sent with the greatest Part of the Horse to St  Blase  Bridge which was the only Passage by which the Ene∣my could enlarge their Quarters on that Side Sir  Thomas Basset  a  Cornish  Man was likewise sent thither with his Tertia of Foot and I was with his Excellency The Enemy by this Disposition of our Army finding they were encompassed on all Sides and that it was im∣possible to break through with their whole Ar∣my without apparent Ruine resolved to chuse the least Evil and that their Horse being about Two Thousand should attempt in the Night to break thro' the Valley between both Armies which succeeding they might march with great Diligence and pass the River at  Saltash  before our Army could overtake them  and so get to  Plymouth  and that  Essex  should take Shipping at  Foy  and meet his Horse at  Plymouth  and that Major General  Skippon  who commanded the Infantry should stay with them to defend them as long as he could and at last make Articles for them being caught in a Net This Resolution being taken it was put in Execution the next Night and Gene∣ral  Goring  being at St  Blase  a Soldier from the King's Quarters for Orders brought a Letter without any Seal written in great Haste by the King himself in these Words  Goring the Enemy have this Night past broke thro' our Quarters with their Horse after some Resistance made by our Horse Guard commanded by  Cleve∣land  who was not able to hinder their Passage being near five times his Number They were like to have surprized Sir  Edward Waldgrave  's Brigade in their Passage but he having some Notice of their March prevented them They are gone in great Haste without Bag or Bag∣gage towards  Saltash  commanded by Sir  Wil∣liam Balfour  Some of our Horse are gone to stop their Passage at  Saltash  if it be possible You must therefore immediately march after them with all your Horse and leave  Butler  with the Foot to keep St  Blase  Bridge  The General got his Army together forthwith and marched after the Enemy with great Diligence but was told by some Troops that followed them from the King's Quarters that it was impossible to overtake them they being returned upon that Account Upon this Information which the  General had from some considerable Officers who had followed the Enemy to no Purpose his Excellency thought fit to return and sent the Horse to their Quarters and went to tell the King he had been able to do nothing of what he had commanded The General then stayed with the King where Orders were forth∣with given concerning the Enemy's Infantry and upon Assurance that the Earl of  Essex  with the Lord  Roberts  and several others were gone by Sea to  Plymouth  and that their Foot Army began early in the Morning to retire towards  Foy  in Hopes to find Ships there to transport them to their General  Essex  at  Ply∣mouth  The King's Army hereupon being in their Rear pressed them so close that they were forced to fight from Hedge to Hedge be∣ing in an inclosed Country and tho' they were many times put to a disorderly Retreat how∣ever they fought till the Night parted us The next Morning early Major General  Skippon  sent Collonel  Butler  to desire a Parly which being accepted and Hostages delivered the Treaty began that Morning in the King's Quar∣ters and Articles were soon agreed upon all Arms Cannon and Ammunition to be delive∣red with their Carriages We took Fifty Pieces of Brass Cannon Three Hundred Barrels of Powder with Match and Ball proportionable Seven Hundred Carriages between Nine and Ten Thousand Arms and many common Sol∣diers deserted and those who stayed marched off only with Sticks in their Hands but all  Collonels and Field Officers were on Horseback with their Swords only with Major General  Skippon  in the Head of the Army who carried his Loss with a very good Grace and they were to be conducted to  Winchester  Collonel  Thomas Bulstrode  my Cousin Ger∣man had there a Foot Regiment and I pre∣vailed with General  Goring  that if I could disengage him from that Service he should be well received and have the same Command in our Army And in order to this I accompa∣nied him two Days and shewed him all the Kindness I could and used my best Endeavours to take him off from that Party but he was so bigotted and seduced by the Zealots of that Army that I could prevail nothing with him who told me plainly he was resolved to suffer with his Brethren as he called them rather than to quit them or accept of any Employ∣ment I could offer him And added that his Father was Governour of  Aylesbury  and had raised at his own Expences two Regiments for the Parliament and that he was resolved to run the same Fortune with the rest of his Com∣rades and therefore desired I would not press him farther in that against which he had taken a final Resolution and so I left him as I found him wilful stubborn and full of rebellious Principles  This Defeat of their Army in  Cornwal  was certainly of very great Consequence for tho' their Horse escaped yet most of their Foot were destroyed by their long and tedious March  thro' an Enemy's Country wanting Provisions and Necessaries especially thro'  Cornwal  and  Devonshire  which were great Enemies to them and all our Army of Horse marching at the same time near them towards  Oxford  and our Infantry followed so that the Country People would scarce give them Provisions for Money They found the same also in  Dorsetshire  the Country People being usually for the strongest Party and the King's Affairs at that time run very smoothly And tho' the Parliament Offi∣cers did always lessen their Defeats and enlarge their Victories yet this Loss of theirs was so visible that it gave great Reputation to the King's Affairs and many scurvy Reflections were made upon  Essex  's leaving the Army which did proceed as was publickly said ei∣ther out of Fear or Cowardice neither of which was believed by thinking Men knowing that the Earl of  Essex  durst fight and had fought and very well deserved of the Parliament be∣fore and therefore they were rather of Opi∣nion that  Essex  finding more of their Inten∣tions who managed the great Design in the House of Commons than was at first imparted to him he saw no Way would bring the leading Members in both Houses to a Compliance with the King in those peaceable Propositions his Majesty made to them by his Letters not only after  Waller  's Defeat at  Cropredy  but after his signal Victory in  Cornwal  than by keeping things as near as his Excellency could in an equal Ba∣lance However it was generally known that  there were great Designs against  Essex  many being very desirous to remove him from his Sta∣tion of General upon their Jealousy that he was too much inclined to Peace tho' we found no such thing from him neither had the Parlia∣ment any Reason to believe it for by raising the Siege of  Gloucester  which  Essex  had done with great Dexterity he did the Parliament so great Service that they could never sufficiently acknowledge it that Siege having been one of the greatest Misfortunes that happened to King  Charles  during the War and those who advised the King to it either thro' Ignorance or Malice did more Mischief to the King's Affairs than the greatest of his Enemies For if the King had marched towards  London  when he sat down before  Gloucester  he had in all hu∣man Appearance made an End of the War But this King was very ill served in his Wars thro' too much Fire and Heat in some of his Generals by their frequent Factions among themselves wherein the King found Difficulty enough to reconcile them even where he was in Person and divers sudden Changes were made afterwards which proved very disadvan∣tageous to the King This was the Time when really those that wished well to the King yet sacrificed his Security to their Animosities against each other without any Design of Treachery but to the King's irreparable Da∣mage A Time in which Want of Discretion produced as much Mischief as the most plain Villainy for the King suffered as much by  the Faction of his Counsellours by their not foreseeing what was evident and by their Jea∣lousies of what was not like to be they often deliberated too long without Resolution and as often resolved without deliberating and ne∣ver executed rigorously what was resolved up∣on and all went to wreck by Negligence In∣advertency and Dejection of Spirit It was in this Year that the Queen was delivered at  Exeter  of the Princess  Henrietta Maria  who was put into the Hands of the Lady  Dalkeith  after which the Queen took Shipping at  Pen∣dennis  Castle in  Cornwal  and arrived safely in  France  Before the King left  Buconnock  in  Cornwal  several Addresses were made to him in the Lord  Wilmot  's Behalf but the Lord  Digby  being then Secretary of State still delayed the Business the Lord  Wilmot  in the mean time being first sent Prisoner to  Exeter  from thence to  Barnstable  At last upon the King's being daily importuned in that Affair the Lord  Digby  gave this Answer from the King and that they were to expect no other which was as follows  That upon the Earl of  Essex  's marching into  Cornwal  it was resolved at a Cabinet Council where the Lord  Wilmot  was That the King should write with his own Hand to the Earl of  Essex  offering him what Conditions he pleased if he would lay down his Arms come to the King and leave his Army to the King's Mercy and it was precisely ordered by the King in Coun∣cil that no Person should take Notice of that  Letter or send any Message to the Earl of  Essex  That notwithstanding this particular Command of the King's the Lord  Wilmot  bid him that carried the Letter to remember his Service to the Earl of  Essex  desiring he would lay hold of the Opportunity then offered assu∣ring him the King should make good his Word and that he    the Lord  Wilmot  would take Care the Courtiers should not hinder it nor car∣ry things as they had done  Upon this Answer the Officers gave over their Pursuit of any farther Addresses and the Lord  Wilmot  was no farther questioned but went into  France  at the End of the War and was the chief Person that saved the Life of King  Charles  II after his Defeat at  Worcester  and carried him safe into  France  and was in great Esteem with that King even to his Death and his Disgrace under King  Charles  I was look'd upon purely as an Effect of the Power General  Goring  had at that time with the King who had certainly all  Wilmot  's Faults but wanted his Regularity and preserving his Respects with the Officers  Wilmot  always shut Debauchery out of his Bu∣siness never neglected that and so rarely mis∣carried in it  Goring  had a sharper Wit and much a keener Courage and Presence of Mind in Danger in which  Wilmot  could not behave himself so well and therefore warily declined it as he did near  Southam  at the Beginning of the War when the King was near  Coventry  before his Standard was set up and for missing that Opportunity of Fighting his Lordship  was much blamed  Wilmot  never drank when he was within Distance of an Enemy and  Goring  seldom or never refused it and could not resist Temptations and therefore he had always much Company and few Friends and he loved no Man so well but he would cozen him and then laugh at him for being cozened  About this Time General  Goring  was sent for with his Forces to the King and upon his first coming lying at  Bampton in the Bush  he defeated the Enemy which gave him such Re∣putation that he was sent into the West with full Power as Generalissimo and General of all the Horse of  England  His Excellency then went to  Taunton  and besieged it which Place was reduced to some Necessity when Collonel  Graves  came to relieve it Whereupon the Ge∣neral drew up the Hills whilst  Graves  put some Recruits and Provisions into the Town At the same time the General sent Sir  John Digby  Major General of the Horse with a great Detachment to fall upon Collonel  Graves  in his Retreat in which Action Sir  John Dig∣by  had good Success and took many Prisoners But being shot in the Arm he was sent to  Bridg∣water  to be cured but his Arm gangrened and he there died to the great Regret of the Army and of all that knew him So soon as  Graves  was retired General  Goring  drew down his Army again to besiege  Taunton  which put the Garrison into greater Consternation than before believing the King must have had some extraordinary Success which made our Gene∣ral  take those Measures We pressed them so hard that we were like to be soon Masters of the Place but that an unlucky Accident hap∣pened of Sir  William Courtney  's and Collonel  Thornhill  's falling foul upon each other in∣stead of the Enemy which was a great Misfor∣tune and tho' the Governour  Blague  defen∣ded the Place very bravely we were likely to be Masters of it in a very little time  But I must not forget that after the Defeat in  Cornwal  the King staying some time in the Western Parts  Essex  got together another Ar∣my and being joined with  Waller  and  Man∣chester  was then so strong that he hoped to take his Revenge and encompass the King who was then going to  Oxford  taking  Newbury  in his Way  Essex  with his Army had made his Rendezvous in  Aldermarston  Park belonging to Sir  Humphrey Foster  from whence he came more suddenly upon us than we expected which put us into some Confusion They attacked us at the same time in several Places with diffe∣rent Success being much stronger than we and when they could not prevail in one Place they attack'd us in another hoping in the End to surround us So that there was fighting at the same time in several Places in most of which the Enemy prevailed and we retired and were upon the Defensive in all Parts Upon the West Side of  Spine  they pressed us very hard where young Sir  John Greenvil  was posted up∣on a high Rising Ground with some Foot and Cannon with a small Retrenchment before him  General  Goring  being then on that Side and see∣ing the Enemy intended to attack that Place with Horse and Foot to prevent which he resolved to charge their Horse with the Earl of  Cleveland  's Brigade which was then drawn up on that Side which was done accordingly But the Earl of  Cleveland  engaging his Person too far was there taken Prisoner and then a great Body of the Enemy's Foot advanced in good Order upon Sir  John Greenvil  forced him from that Post with the Loss of some Men and Cannon and himself wounded in the Head with a Sword in this Action Upon this Success the Enemy pursued furiously and the Fight continued very hot the Enemy still advancing Where∣upon I was commanded by General  Goring  to bring up the Queen's Regiment of Horse which was then in Reserve commanded by Sir  John Cansfield  who charged them so home that he stopp'd their Career and obliged them to re∣treat which gave some breathing Time to our Troops on that Side but in this Action Sir  John Cansfield  had one of his Legs shot and broken And while we were thus fighting on that Side of  Spine Manchester  with his Ar∣my attacked Mr  Doleman  's House at  Shaw  below the Castle where there was a sharp En∣gagement all that Afternoon and the Garden was warmly attacked and as well defended by the Collonels  Lisle  and  Thelwell  with the Help of Sir  Thomas Hooper  's Dragoons and a little before the Evening Sir  John Brown  with the Prince's Regiment of Horse charged the Ene∣my  so briskly that he obliged them to retreat up the Hill with the Loss of some Colours and two Field Pieces of Cannon Thus the Fight continued on all Sides till the Night parted us The King stayed in the Field till Midnight that all our Cannon were drawn within the Walls of  Dennington  Castle for their Security and then General  Goring  with most of the Army marched that Night towards  Oxford  without any Alarm from the Enemy who durst not follow us and the King went to  Bristol  The next Day after our Retreat  Essex  possess'd himself very quietly of  Newbury  making little Doubt of taking  Dennington  Ca∣stle which was thrice summoned and as often stormed but without Success and finding it would be a Work of Time and nothing was to be got there but Blows he retired with his Army and quitted  Newbury  to which Place General  Goring  soon came again relieved the Castle with what was wanting and brought off all our Cannon  The Parliament finding that  Newbury  was quitted not only without but against their Order and all the Cannon brought away from  Dennington  Castle tho' the Parliament Armies were more than double to the Number of the King's they were much displeased at the Pro∣ceedings of  Essex  which being joined with great Aspersions of his ill Conduct in  Cornwal  made the Parliament resolve to new model their Army which they would do with great Policy by Degrees that the less Notice might be taken  of it In order to this they first made a Selfdenying Ordinance as they called it that after such a prefixed Time which was then declared no Member of either House of Par∣liament should enjoy any Office either Civil or Military  The Winter following this Year General  Goring  was quartered at  Bruton  in  Somersetshire  at Sir  Charles Berkeley  's a great inclosed Coun∣try where the Villages were thick and great Store of Forage For Horse Sir  William Waller  was then quartered at  Salisbury  in  Wiltshire  where the Villages are thin standing only in the Valleys some Distance from each other General  Goring  taking this Advantage sent out Parties almost every Night to beat up the Enemy's Quarters in  Wiltshire  which was done with such good Success that in a short time we took many Prisoners and Colours which occa∣sioned  Waller  to write this ensuing Letter to General  Goring Noble Lord God's Blessing he on your Heart you are the jolliest Neighbour I have ever met with I wish for nothing more but an Opportunity to let you know I would not be behind in this kind of Courtesy In the mean time if your Lordship please to release such Prisoners as you have of mine for the like Num∣ber and Quality that I have of yours I shall esteem it as a great Civility being your Lord∣ship's most Humble and Obedient Servant  William Waller  This Letter was brought by a Trumpeter who had been often with us and was well known to us and was a good pleasant Droll and whilst we were at Dinner in the General's Quarters a Party of Horse returned with five Colours and several Prisoners of Collonel  Popham  's Regiment whose Quarters were beaten up the Night before Upon this the General sent for the Trumpeter into the Room where we were at Dinner to shew him the Colours and the principal Prisoners Whereupon the Trumpeter pressed his Excellency to dispatch him back with his Answer fearing if he should stay longer that  Waller  himself might be taken before he the Trumpeter could reach  Salisbu∣ry  and so he was dispatched with this Answer from the General  That if Sir  William Waller  had Authority and could nominate two Officers of Quality of his Army to meet two Officers of the like Quality of General  Goring  's Army at any convenient Place between both Armies they should be empowered to exchange all Priso∣ners on both Sides of equal Quality from the  LandsEnd  in  Cornwal  to  Portsmouth  in  Hamp∣shire Which Sir  William Waller  willingly ac∣cepted and accordingly named Collonel  Ennis  his Adjutant General and Major  Butler  who was Major to  Waller  's own Regiment and desired  Shaftsbury  might be the Place of Meeting To this the General willingly consented and sent a Pass by the same Trumpeter for the Persons na∣med by Sir  William Waller  and at the same time nominated me with Sir  Bernard Gascoigne  Ma∣jor  to his own Regiment Commissioners from his Excellency And accordingly a Pass was sent us forthwith from Sir  William Waller  and the Time appointed for our Meeting at  Shafts∣bury  to which Place we all came the same Day with our Servants and Trumpeters with each The Country People believing we were appoin∣ted to make a Peace flocked in great Numbers to  Shaftsbury  where we stayed fifteen Days to release all Prisoners of Quality on both Sides from the  LandsEnd  in the West to  Portsmouth  Sir  William Waller  sent us a great Present of Wines which came from  London  believing we could have none such elsewhere We then appointed all our Prisoners to be brought to  Wareham  in  Dorsetshire  and all the Prisoners of the Parliament's Side to be brought to  ChristChurch  in  Hampshire  and Sir  Bernard Gascoigne  went to  Wareham  to receive our Prisoners and Major  Butler  went to  ChristChurch  to receive the Parliament's Collonel  Ennis  returned to  Salisbury  and I came back to  Bruton  to give the Generals an Account of what we had done  Now the King having often sollicited the Parliament for Peace even after both his Victories at  Cropredy  Bridge and in  Cornwal  and the Parliament seeing the general In∣clination of the People and City of  London  bend that way that they might seem at least to have the same Desires for the Good of the Na∣tion tho' it plainly appeared they otherwise intended the Parliament with the Consent of the Commissioners for  Scotland  present some  Propositions to the King which they desire may be treated on at  Uxbridge  To which Treaty the King soon agreed when it was well known the Parliament never intended to come to an Agreement by their most irrational and unjust Demands which they knew the King could neither in Reason Honour or Consci∣ence grant and so the Treaty was soon bro∣ken to the King's great Dissatisfaction who then clearly saw the Parliament was resolved to prosecute the War against him to the last Extremity  About this time the great Designs against  Essex  began to appear who was much suspected by those who designed to destroy both Govern∣ment Ministry and Magistracy and resolved to remove the Earl of  Essex  from his Command and took Resolutions to put the Selfdenying Ordinance in Execution But  Essex Manche∣ster  and  Denbigh  forthwith surrendered their Commissions the same did likewise the Earl of  Warwick  their Admiral they being all fully perswaded by the Parliament's Procee∣ding that they intended to perpetuate them∣selves and the usurped Government of the three Nations and to make themselves a free State under a Presbyterian Government But the Parliament were much mistaken in their Policy and were soon deprived of their main Design and quickly lost all that Dominion which they so eagerly desired and so long ga∣ped for it being presently snatched out of their Hands by the Independent Party who were  newly sprung up out of their own Bowels For notwithstanding their SelfDenying Ordinance  Cromwell  was dispensed with to hold his Com∣mand of Lieutenant General to Sir  Thomas Fairfax  who was made General of their new modelled Army whose first Rendezvous was at  Windsor  where they did their own Business and quite ruined the King's  The first Success by this new modelled Ar∣my was performed by  Cromwell  who wasting the Country with a Body of Horse fell unex∣pectedly upon a Party at  Islip  Bridge comman∣ded by the Earl of  Northampton  who were defeated and some Prisoners taken and the Remainder pursued to  Bleckington House  four Miles from  Oxford  where Collonel  Windebank  was settled for some time with a small Party of Horse and Foot  Cromwell  presently summo∣ned the House which had only a Wall about it the Governour forthwith surrendered it and had Articles to retire to  Oxford  where be∣ing called to a Council of War he was con∣demned and shot to Death for delivering it so soon to a Party of Horse only when he might have had speedy Assistance from  Oxford  which was but four Miles from  Bleckington  About this time General  Goring  was at the Siege of  Taunton  of which he was in great Hopes soon to be Master at least he made us all believe so when he received Letters from the King some Days before his taking of  Lei∣cester  commanding him to quit the Siege of  Taunton  and hasten to him with his Army  fearing the Enemy would be too strong for him To which I wrote the General's Answer to the King having kept the Copy of it which was to this Effect  That he was certain in few Days to be Master of  Taunton  and should leave that Country free from any Enemy excep∣ting  Lyme  which was then and had been for some Time blocked up whereas if he should leave the Siege the Enemy would be Masters of that Country and therefore he most humbly prayed the King to forbear any Engagement and to be upon the Defensive upon the River of  Trent  which he might very well do till the Siege of  Taunton  was ended and then he would bring his Army to serve the King to his best Advantage and he did again desire the King to keep at a Distance and not engage  But the taking of  Leicester  being a great Loss to the Parliament and of such Advantage to the King that his Majesty then wrote to the Queen that he might without being too much sanguine af∣firm that since the Rebellion began his Affairs were never in so hopeful a Way and indeed the Parliament was then likewise of the same Opi∣nion But this Letter from the General being intercepted by  Fairfax  caused his sudden Ad∣vance from his Rendezvous at  Brickhill  to send in great Haste for  Cromwell  who was gone into the Isle of  Ely  upon whose Return a Resolu∣tion was taken to engage the King forthwith to a Battle before the Loss of  Taunton  and that General  Goring  should arrive with his Army Now the King not having Advice from Ge∣neral  Goring  by his Letter being intercepted and both his and his Soldiers Spirits being much heightened by taking of  Leicester  and the King hearing the Enemy was advancing to∣wards him a Council was forthwith called at Midnight where it was resolved to give the Enemy Battle the next Day to which the King then prepared and had in all Appearance gained a Victory if Prince  Rupert  who was some∣time before made Lieutenant General of all the King's Armies in Place of the Earl of  Brentford  had not after his usual Manner having defeated the Enemy's left Wing pursued furiously so far as to leave the Foot naked who were severely fallen upon by the Enemy's Reserve of Horse who had put them in great Disorder and the whole Army was almost to∣tally broken before the Prince came back to to their Relief tho' the King in Person to the great Hazard of his Life did all that possibly could be done by Valour in rallying his Horse and endeavouring to maintain the Battle but seeing all lost the King was forced to fly to∣wards  Leicester  for his own Safety leaving the Enemy wholly Masters of the Field The Loss of all was Prince  Rupert  's pursuing the Horse which he had beaten whose natural Heat and Impatience was such that he could not endure the Enemy in View nor would he believe the Enemy had Courage to endure his Charge and thus the Army was engaged be∣fore the Cannon was turned or the Ground made choice of upon which they were to fight  So that Courage was only to be relied on where all Conduct failed However if the King had then gone directly into the West where he had an Army ready formed and People generally devoted to his Service instead of amusing him∣self about forming a new Army in Countries worn out with the Oppression of his own Troops and the Licence of their Governours he might have given the Enemy a great Interruption if not restored his Affairs Thus this fatal Battle of  Naseby  fought the th of  June  proved the entire Ruine of all the King's Affairs The King after this Battle fled from Place to Place not well knowing which Way to turn himself At last he came to  Newark  where he received a new Mortification from his Subjects then in Arms for him much sharper than any he had received from the Enemy which he suffered with more Grief and Perplexity of Mind Prince  Rupert  and Prince  Maurice  after the Loss of the West and  Bristol  were at  Belvoir  Castle where the King commanded them to stay and not to follow him to  Newark  but contrary to the King's Commands they both came thither and Prince  Rupert  told his Ma∣jesty he was come to give an Account of the Loss of  Bristol  and to clear himself from those Imputations that had been cast upon him for the Surrender of that Place Tho' the King was displeased with the Prince's coming thither contrary to his Orders he was yet resolved to hear Prince  Rupert  's Defence who had promi∣sed the King to hold  Bristol  at least four Months  and yet gave it up almost in as few Days And he told Prince  Rupert  that he did really be∣lieve the Prince had no Design against his Ser∣vice and that he would command a Declaration to be drawn up by which the Prince should be absolved from any Disloyalty either in that or any other Action of the War but that in Truth he could not absolve him of Indiscretion in the Delivery of  Bristol  The King resolved to retreat from  Newark  towards  Oxford  because the Enemy were on the North Side of  Trent  but he imparted his Resolution to none except to two or three of the nearest Trust about him and finding great Differences grow betwixt Sir  Richard Willis  the Governour and the Gentlemen of the Country who were firm to him and whose Interest alone had preserved that Place and finding no Way to preserve that Garrison but by Removal of the Gover∣nour he sent for him into his Bedchamber and after many gracious Expressions of the Sa∣tisfaction he had received in his Service he told him his Design was to go that Night and to take him with him and to make him Captain of his Guards in Place of the Earl of  Litch∣field  who was lately killed near  Chester  and would leave Collonel  Bellasis  Governour there who being allied to most of the Gentry of the adjacent Counties would be more acceptable to them and that he could not give a more ample Justification of his Services and of his Satis∣faction in them than by the Honour and Trust he conferred upon him Sir  Richard Willis  appeared much troubled and excused his taking the other Command as a Place of too great Honour and that his Fortune could not maintain him in that Employment and said his Enemies would triumph in his Removal The King told him he would take Care and provide for his Support and so went out of his Chamber to Church and after his Return being at Dinner Prince  Rupert  Prince  Mau∣rice  Lord  Gerard  and Sir  Richard Willis  with about Twenty Officers of the Garrison came into the PresenceChamber where Sir  Richard Willis  addressed himself to the King and told him it was the publick Talk of the Town that he was disgraced and turned out from his Government and Prince  Rupert  added Sir  Richard Willis  was to be removed from his Go∣vernment for no other Fault but for being his Friend The Lord  Gerard  said it was a Plot of the Lord  Digby  who was a Traitor and he would prove him to be so The King was so much surprized at these extravagant and insolent Discourses that he rose from Dinner in great Disorder and retiring into his Bed∣chamber he called Sir  Richard Willis  to follow him who answered loudly that he had re∣ceived a publick Injury and expected a publick Satisfaction This so provoked his Majesty that with much greater Indignation than ever he was seen possessed with he commanded them to depart his Presence and to come no more into it and this with such Circumstances in his Looks and Gesture as well as Words that  they appeared no less confounded and departed the Room ashamed of what they had done Yet so soon as they came to the Governour's House they sounded to Horse intending to be presently gone but soon after they sent to the King for Passes who gave them such as they desired and sent them and declared Collonel  Bellasis  Governour of  Newark  but forgot at the same time to have hanged up Sir  Richard Willis  for his insolent Carriage towards his Sovereign  After this the King went to  Oxford  sent several Messages for Peace and for a present Treaty that he would come to  London  and put himself into their Hands But nothing would be accepted And tho' he tried to deal with the Independants yet it was in vain the King's ill Success run on in a continued Series in this Year he lost more in three Months than he had gotten before in three Years The  French  seemed glad of these Disorders amongst us Cardinal  Richlieu  having had an implacable Malice and Hatred to  England  ever since the Isle of  Rhee  Voyage and the declared Protecti∣on of  Rochel  against the King and he being now dead and Cardinal  Mazarin  in his Place an  Italian  who seemed very kind to the Queen but yet gave very little and ordinary Supplies that he might a little continue the Struggle but he was more sollicitous to keep a good Corre∣spondence with the Parliament and to profess a Neutrality betwixt the King and the Parlia∣ment by means of  Don Alonzo de Cardinas  the  Spanish  Ambassador who made all his Ad∣dresses to the Parliament But that which put a Period to all our King's Hopes was the De∣feating the Lord  Astley  near  Stow in the Wold  who was taken Prisoner with several other Offi∣cers and were all either killed or dispersed as they were coming from  Worcester  to  Oxford  which hindred the King from drawing any other Troops into the Field and being now in the Ebb of his good Fortunes he thought it in vain to expect a Treaty with his Parliament who in the Height of his good Success would listen to no Reason Yet to satisfy his Friends who were generally inclined to Peace he sent a Message to his Parliament full of tender Ex∣pressions setting forth his deep Sense of the Nation's Miseries by these civil Distractions amongst them and conjured them as they would answer it to Almighty God in that Day when he should make Inquisition for Blood which had or might be spilt in that unnatu∣ral War and as they tendred the Preservation of their Religion by all the Bonds of Duty and Allegiance to their King of Compassion for their bleeding Country or Charity to them∣selves to dispose their Hearts to a true Sense and to employ their Faculties to a more serious Endeavour together with his Majesty to put a speedy End to these wasting Divisions and to make both King and People happy But this Message produced nothing but much more in∣solent Propositions than those at  Uxbridge  and it was in vain for the King to expostulate with  them who were resolved not to give him any reasonable Satisfaction And tho' the House of Lords was willing to correspond with the King's Desires yet they were overruled and curbed by the Commons the Lords then standing but as Cyphers and were forced by the Commons into a Compliance in whatever they desired or determined and if the Lords dissented to any Particular they would do it without them the active Commons doing all things at their Plea∣sure Which did sufficiently demonstrate that they had no Intention to come to any Agreement of Peace but to pursue their Designs to the uttermost Round of the Ladder and having once drawn their Swords against their lawful Prince to throw away the Scabbard knowing their Crimes could not be safe but by attempt∣ing greater And tho' the Design was hatched in the House of Commons for the Extirpation of Monarchy yet I really believe the tenth Part of them never knew nor thought that the Business would go so far as at last it did they looking no farther than the bare Outside of Things which carried a fair Shew and Gloss to fight for King and Parliament and were in∣sensibly drawn in by the Insinuation of the prevailing Party  The King found all his Endeavours for Peace signified nothing that the Commons were re∣solved upon his Ruine and that nothing would serve but his Submission to all they demanded against which he was absolutely resolved it being his Obligation in Honour and Conscience  not to abandon a just Cause nor injure his Suc∣cessor nor forsake his Friends and therefore expected no other Success but to end his Days with Honour and a good Conscience and did seriously avow as appeared by his Letter to Prince  Rupert  wherein he freely told the Prince that those who would stay with him were to expect and resolve either to die for a good Cause or which was worse to live as miserable in maintaining it as the Insolence of insulting Rebels could make them  I must confess I knew not General  Goring  till he came to the King in  Cornwal  after the Battle of  MarstonMoor  but I have heard great Reflections made upon his Conduct in the Busi∣ness of  Portsmouth  of which he was Gover∣nour in the Beginning of the War and most wondered why the King would employ him being made General of all the Horse in  England  and Generalissimo in the West both of Horse and Foot But I believe he had done some ex∣traordinary Service for our King in  France  before he came over with the Queen and I have been informed from good Hands that he did not only procure great Store of Arms and Ammunition but furnished the Queen also with a considerable Sum of Money which he got by his Dexterity and Cunning which pre∣vailed so much with the King that by the Queen's Intercession he gave him those great Commands which made a mighty Noise in the Army and gave great Discontent to many As to his Person I had as much Reason to know  him as any and was always entrusted with his most secret Dispatches and tho' I know his Memory remains blasted upon several Occasions yet I cannot but do him this Right which com∣mon Honesty obliges me to say of him That he was a Person of extraordinary Abilities as well as Courage and was without Dispute as good an Officer as any served the King and the most dexterous in any sudden Emergency that I have ever seen and could extricate himself with the least Concern of which I was a par∣ticular EyeWitness upon several Occasions in the Siege of  Taunton  where Collonel  Blague  the then Governour made many sharp and un∣expected Sallies but he was still repulsed and beaten back with Loss by the Courage and Dexterity of General  Goring  without which that Siege had been soon raised But after all that can be said in General  Goring  's Behalf he had likewise his blind Side for he strangely loved the Bottle was much given to his Plea∣sures and a great Debauchee and the great Misfortune was when he commanded in chief in the West of  England  his Excellency had two Companions who commanded next under him who fed his wild Humour and Debauch and one of them if not both wanted his great and natural Courage These two Commanders the one being Lieutenant General made the General turn his Wantonness into Riot and his Riot into Madness So that if the King had been truly informed of their continued strange Debauches his Majesty would either have re∣moved  them from him or all Three from fu∣ture Trust or Employment For when Princes give way to the Vices of their Commanders tho' they be never so brave Men they seldom recompense their Neglects by any future Dili∣gence for they must stand in Awe of the Prince they serve or else the Prince must be Servant to their Humour  Whilst the Siege of  Taunton  continued I confess Lieutenant General  Porter  had several Conferences with the Officers of the Rebels that were then in that Garrison to the great Scan∣dal of many who knew not what Interpreta∣tion to make of it but this being often practi∣sed among the Chiefs of the Army much No∣tice was not taken of it About this time Ge∣neral  Goring  seemed something discontented with the Prince's Council whereupon Sir  John Berkeley  Sir  Hugh Pollard  and Collonel  Ashburnham  were sent to confer with General  Goring  to know particularly what he desired Their Conference was kept very private how∣ever I was informed that the General carried himself very extravagantly and that they could not satisfy him Sir  Thomas Fairfax  being then coming into the West against General  Goring  the Prince of  Wales  recommended to him the Garrison of  Langport  as being of great Impor∣tance for the Security of  Bridgwater  But Ge∣neral  Goring  's Troops being quartered about  Langport  took away the Contribution assigned for the Support of it to supply his own Army which brought the Garrison so low that when  it might have been very advantageous to our Army it had very little or no Provision in it And then to add to our Misery the Clubmen in  Dorset  and  Somersetshire  began to rise and sent Complaints to the Prince of  Wales  of the great Oppressions and Disorders committed by our Army which the Prince promised to re∣form and went to General  Goring  about it setting forth the great Danger the Country was in by the Liberty his Troops took to them∣selves But the General having no Money to give the Army connived at the Licence they took and at the same time to shew his Popu∣larity sided in many things with the Clubmen who in the End did us as much Mischief as the Power of the Rebels who about that time being towards the Month of  July  entered  Somersetshire  and being suppressed and agreed with Sir  Thomas Fairfax  he besieged and took  Sherborn  Castle which was well defended by Sir  Lewis Dives  who was there taken Prisoner with Collonel  Strangeways  and several others After the taking of  Sherborn  the Parliament Army advanced towards General  Goring  who was encamped about  Langport  which by rea∣son of the River on the one Side and the great Marsh or Bogg betwixt that and  Bridgwater  was esteemed a strong Post and likewise to make a good Retreat in Case we were beaten The Day before we engaged the General sent Lieutenant General  Porter  with three Brigades of Horse on the other Side the River farther from the Enemy than we were and in a Race  Campagne who had his Quarters beaten up at Noon Day by General  Massey  for want of Scouts being out the Lieutenant General be∣ing then in his utmost Debauches with some of his Officers The Enemy was seen coming from the Hills a Mile before them and yet was up∣on our Men before they could get to their Horses who were feeding in the Meadows The Alarm being brought to General  Goring  he immediately marched in Person to his Suc∣cour rallied the Horse that were flying stopp'd the Enemy's Carreer who were eagerly pursu∣ing and made a handsome Retreat without which the best Part of our Army had been lost that Day and when our General met Lieute∣nant General  Porter  in the Rear flying with the rest his Excellency turned to me and said  He deserves to be pistoll'd for his Negligence or Cowardice  but being the General's BrotherinLaw that Fault was soon forgotten and pardoned And yet I have often heard the Ge∣neral say  That his BrotherinLaw Lieutenant General  Porter  was the best Company but the worst Officer that ever served the King  After this Beating up of Lieutenant General  Porter  's Quarters  Fairfax  with his Army marched directly to us from  Evil  where be∣ing a plain and rising Ground the Enemy's Army was drawn up upon it with a great Marsh and Bogg between both Armies which hindred the Enemy from attacking us except by one Passage in the Bottom of the Hill between both Armies which Passage was narrow and  our General had placed there two Regiments of Foot to guard that Passage which were Collo∣nel  Slaughter  's and Collonel  Wise  's Regiments lately raised in South  Wales  General  Goring  himself with all his Horse was drawn up upon the Hill at the Mouth of the Passage with the Infantry upon his right Hand near  Langport  to succour those two Regiments in case of Attack upon the Pass which the Gene∣ral hoped to make good at least till Night that then we might retire with less Loss being unseen In the mean time General  Goring  commanded me to send away all the Baggage and Cannon except two Field Pieces which he commanded should be drawn to the Top of the Hill at the Head of the Pass and bid me to order Sir  Joseph Wagstaffe  from him who commanded the Foot near to  Langport  that in case the Enemy should force the Pass upon him that then Sir  Joseph Wagstaffe  should retire with all his Foot to  Langport  and there pass the River towards  Bridgwater  and burn down the Bridge behind him which was a Drawbridge over the River and in the Morning when I had Orders to send away the Baggage and Cannon I sent them that Way for their greater Security otherwise they had been all lost for we were in Hopes to keep that Pass till Night Yet so soon as the Enemy had put their Army in Order of Battle upon the Top of the Hill on the other Side the Bogg which we thought was their whole Army they opened and drew to their Right and Left advancing  towards the Pass whilst another great Body came up in their Place by which their Army was more than double our Number However our General neither lost his Courage nor Con∣duct but still remained at the Head of the Pass with his own Guards of Horse comman∣ded by Collonel  Patrick Barnwell  a very brave  Irish  Gentleman Son to the Lord  Barnwell  next to him was the General's own Regiment of Horse commanded by Collonel  Charles Goring  his Excellency's Brother who was also seconded by Sir  Arthur Slingsby  with his Regiment of Horse and the rest of the Horse Army behind him but the Enemy advancing very fast down the Hill with Horse Foot Dragoons and Cannon much overpowered us in Number and our Foot that were drawn down to guard the Pass not doing their Duty many of them deserting and shooting against us the Enemy thereupon gained the Pass The General charged the Enemy twice but being much overpowered in Number we were at last beaten off and obliged to a very disorderly Re∣treat The Foot commanded by Major Gene∣ral  Wagstaffe  retired to  Langport  as did like∣wise the Lord  Wentworth  and retreated over the Bridge that Way to  Bridgwater  having broken and burnt down the Drawbridge be∣hind them But our Horse were obliged to re∣treat the ordinary Way which being a moorish Ground full of several narrow Passes where several Officers were obliged to stay to make good the Retreat for others so that divers of  Distinction were taken too many to be reckoned up and among the Prisoners was Sir  Arthur Slingsby  but Lieutenant General  Porter  esca∣ped that Way Room being made for him by other Officers But our General with his Brother Mr  Barnwell  Sir  Bernard Gascoigne  and my self with some of our Retinue were obliged to leave the Army upon our Left to get over several difficult Places However we came at last safe to  Bridgwater  tho' something about and were in great Fear that all our Foot and Cannon were lost but it seems Sir  Joseph Wagstaffe  marched all Night and came safe the next Morning to  Bridgwater  and we lost only one Piece of Cannon that Way be∣cause the Carriage of it was broke I stayed all that Night with the General in his Chamber and when I gave him Notice in the Morning that Sir  Joseph Wagstaffe  was come with the Foot and the Cannon he was overjoyed  After we had reposed two Days at  Bridg∣water  and got together our shattered Troops who all past thro'  Bridgwater  as fast as they came for their greater Security we then mar∣ched towards  Dunstar  Castle which we left on our Right and made little or no Stop till we came near  Torrington  where our Army quarte∣red and the General made his Head Quarters at Mr  Rolles  's House where we stayed some Days and then we marched towards  Barnsta∣ple  and from thence to  Exeter  where we stayed that Winter with Four Thousand Horse who quartered in the Country near us Whilst  we were about  Torrington  the General sent the Lord  Wentworth  to the Prince of  Wales  at  Launceston  making great Complaints of his hard Usage and made several Demands from the General to which no Answer was given because the Chancellor of the Exchequer was absent being gone farther into  Cornwal  upon great Affairs of the Prince and besides the Prince intended at the Chancellor's Return to go to  Exeter  and when the Prince came thither General  Goring  was ill and in a Course of Physick Whereupon the Chancellor was sent to him to whom after many Assurances of continuing faithful to the King and his Interest he then freely declared his Apprehen∣sion of his Brother  Porter  's Negligence or Treachery in many particular Instances and that he resolved to be quit of him The Chan∣cellor then told his Excellency freely that his Demands by the Lord  Wentworth  to the Prince were not seasonable for his Royal Highness to grant nor fit for him to ask and so the Chan∣cellor left General  Goring  But I must not forget to tell that whilst General  Goring  Lord  Wentworth  Lieutenant General  Porter  and most of the General Offi∣cers both Horse and Foot kept their Winter Quarters in and about  Exeter  the Death of Sir  John Digby  made vacant the Employment of a Major General of Horse to the Lord  Goring  's Army for which there were several Pretendants amongst which was Collonel  Samuel Tuke  who being the eldest Collonel of  Horse in our Army stood fairest for it espe∣cially being a Favourite to Lieutenant Gene∣ral  Porter  and to Collonel  Charles Goring  the General's Brother and therefore made his first Address to the Lieutenant General desiring his Assistance in his Pretentions which being promised him by the Lieutenant General he then applied himself to the Lord General  Goring  who told him he would willingly have served him but that he was before engaged for Collonel  Webb  by the Intercession of Lieute∣nant General  Porter  At which Collonel  Tuke  being much surprized he presently demanded the Lord General's Permission to quit his Com∣mand declaring that being the eldest Collo∣nel in the Army he thought it a Right belon∣ging to him and that he could not serve with Honour since another was put over his Head Hereupon the Lord General forthwith promi∣sed him his Discharge and commanded his Se∣cretary  Dun  to draw it Upon this Infor∣mation from the General himself that he was ingaged for Collonel  Webb  upon the Sollicita∣tion of Lieutenant General  Porter  Collonel  Tuke  wrote a very reproachful Letter to the Lieutenant General which so soon as he re∣ceived he forthwith sent his BrotherinLaw Collonel  Charles Goring  for they were then both at Sir  William Portman  's five Miles from  Exeter  to desire Collonel  Tuke  to meet him at a Place he then appointed to interpret his Letter and Collonel  Goring  also told Collonel  Tuke  that he must bring a Friend with him  who thereupon sent to Collonel  Adrian Scroop  who promised to go with him the next Mor∣ning But this Business was not carried so privately but that it quickly came to the Lord General's Knowledge who presently sent for me and commanded me to set Guards imme∣diately upon Collonel  Tuke  and upon Collo∣nel  Scroop  and to require them in his Excel∣lency's Name not to stir from their Lodgings till farther Orders The Lord General was at this time indisposed with the Gout and kept his Bed but he presently sent for the Lord  Wentworth  and desired him to call a Council of War the next Morning of the principal Of∣ficers that were then Town and that his Lord∣ship would be President of it for that there was a Quarrel and a Duel designed betwixt Lieutenant General  Porter  and Collonel  Tuke  That this last was already secured in his Lod∣ging and also Collonel  Scroop  who was to be his Second and that he had sent for the Lieute∣nant General and his Brother Collonel  Goring  who was concerned in the Quarrel The next Morning the Council of War met where Lieu∣tenant General  Porter  was present and sat with the Council which was composed of the Lord  Wentworth  as President Lieutenant General  Porter  Major General  Wagstaffe  Sir  William Courtney  Sir  Foulk  and Sir  Henry Hunkes  Sir  Thomas Basset  and my self The first thing after having read the Letter upon Debate was That the Letter was very reproachful and provoking The Substance of the Letter was  That he  Collonel  Tuke    would no more accuse Lieutenant General  Porter  of Cowardice since he had fought and killed a Collonel in Justifi∣cation of his Honour but that the Lieutenant General was guilty of many other Sins which ran in the same Rank with Cowardice as in his Breach of Faith having promised to assist him in his Pretentions to the General when he had before ingaged the General to another In his little or no Religion in turning the Bible and all sacred things into Ridicule In his great and constant Debaucheries with many other Vices not fit to be named and that now being upon even Terms with him he could do no less than reproach him for his treacherous and unjust Dealing in this Particular of his Pretentions from the General's own Mouth and that he should look upon him as his darling Sin whom he had loved the longest and had the most Reason to repent him of it  After reading this Letter which was much enlarged upon by the Lieutenant General who declared that tho' the Letter was not a formal Challenge yet it was so provoking and reproach∣ful that no Man of Honour could receive it without giving a Challenge to him that sent it and that this was also from an inferior Officer to a superior which was Death by the Articles of War Hereupon arose a long Debate after which the Council ordered that I should go forthwith to the Lord General to know from him whether he had discharged Collonel  Tuke  from being an Officer in his Army To which  the General told me  That he had discharged him and promised him a formal Discharge in Writing and commanded his Secretary to draw it up and that if it was not done it was the Fault of his Secretary and that since he had discharged him by Word of Mouth he esteemed him to be no longer an Officer  Upon my deli∣vering this Answer from the General the Coun∣cil left off that Point of debating his being an Officer but the Council thought fit a Wri∣ting should be drawn up and presented to him which he should read publickly in Council which was done accordingly in these Words following  I confess to have written a scanda∣lous and injurious Letter to Lieutenant General  Porter  for which I am heartily sorry and so desire his Remission and Friendship  This Wri∣ting being agreed upon by the Council Collo∣nel  Tuke  was called in to make this publick Acknowledgment which Paper being given to Collonel  Tuke  he having first read the Words privately to himself he expressed him∣self in publick thus  I confess to have written a Letter to Lieutenant General  Porter  it was my Sense of him when I wrote it which is still my Belief and there is not a Syllable in it which I will not justify with my Life  Upon this the Council commanded him to withdraw and they began to be very sharp upon him that he should make that publick Declaration contra∣ry to the Sentiment of the Council and it was the Opinion of some that he should be com∣mitted to Prison till he should make that pub∣lick  Acknowledgment which the Council had ordered But Sir  Foulk  and Sir  Henry Hunkes  with Sir  Thomas Basset  declared against it and said tho' he had spoken so publickly his Sense as to his own Letter yet he had not refused  in terminis  to make the Acknowledgment and that therefore before they came to that Extre∣mity of committing him to Prison one of the Council should be sent to him to perswade him to make that publick Acknowledgment and accordingly I was desired to go to him which I did and told him the Sense of the Council and that it was their general Opinion that he should not scruple of making that publick Ack∣nowledgment if he was called in again And upon my Return to the Council and declaring that I found him willing to make that Acknow∣ledgment he was called in again and after his Respects made to the Lord  Wentworth  and the Council he took the Paper in his Hand and said  In Obedience to the Order of your Lordship and this Council I do confess to have written a scandalous and injurious Letter to Lieutenant General  Porter  for which I am heartily sorry and do desire his Remission and Friendship  and then he retired But then the Lieutenant Ge∣neral began to complain heavily and said That was not a sufficient Satisfaction for the publick Scandal he had received nor for the insolent Behaviour of Collonel  Tuke  and he seemed nothing pleased or satisfied with what the Coun∣cil had done who thereupon broke up without farther Satisfaction  Some time after this Lieutenant General  Porter  came again to  Exeter  before it was sur∣rendered and sent again to Collonel  Tuke  for farther Satisfaction but the Collonel being then sick in Bed was not able to meet him as he desired However Collonel  Tuke  did then write a Letter to him assuring him that so soon as he was able to get on Horseback he would not fail to find him out and give him the Satisfaction he desired if the Fear of our sudden Ruine did not make him go to the Par∣liament sooner which fell out as he foretold For soon after this Lieutenant General  Porter  made his Peace with General  Fairfax  and went into the Parliament's Quarters and Col∣lonel  Tuke  never heard more of him nor from him  About this time the King sent to General  Goring  to march to him with his Army but the General neither obeyed the King's Orders nor communicated them to the Prince or advi∣sed with the Prince about them tho' his Royal Highness then let him know that he was well content he should break thro' to the King with his Horse thinking he might well and easily have done it But the General after Recovery of his Health spent his Time in his usual Jol∣lities and was privately resolved to leave the Army and go beyond Sea and Lieutenant General  Porter  was also resolved to quit the Army and retire to  London  but both these Transactions were carried very privately and known to none but the Lord  Wentworth  who  went to the Prince with a Letter from Gene∣ral  Goring  to beg Leave for his going into  France  for Recovery of his Health as he pre∣tended yet intimating at the same time to his Royal Highness that he hoped to do him great Service by his going thither But I was after assured by the Lord  Wentworth  that he never attended the Prince's Resolution but went forthwith to  Dartmouth  and there embarqued for  France  but before his going sign'd a War∣rant for some Money for Lieutenant General  Porter  to bear his Charges to  London  who soon after the Lord  Goring  's Absence declined the Exercise of his Command and having re∣ceived a Pass from Sir  Thomas Fairfax  he went forthwith to  London  Soon after the Lord  Goring  's going for  France  the Lord  Wentworth  declared that General  Goring  intended to return no more but relied upon his Lordship to preserve the Horse till he could procure Licence from the Parliament to transport them for the Service of the King of  Spain  or some other foreign Prince But after General  Goring  left the Army the Sol∣diers took a greater Liberty than before and much resented his going away From the Be∣ginning of  July  till towards the End of  Octo∣ber  the General stayed at  Exeter  and Four Thousand Horse were quartered in that Neigh∣bourhood without making any Attempt upon the Enemy And considering his doing nothing in all that time but pleasing himself many were of Opinion that if he had been confede∣rate  with the Enemy and been corrupted to betray the West he could not have done worse not having obeyed the King's Commands in going to him tho' his Royal Highness was willing to it His Courage indeed was always esteemed but least of all his Conscience and Integrity and there was much Difference be∣twixt the Presentness of his Mind in a sudden Attempt tho' never so full of Danger and of an Enterprize which required Deliberation and Patience for he could not keep his Mind long bent of which I had a particular Experience at his Siege of  Taunton  where the Governour for the Parliament made many frequent and dangerous Sallies but were always unsuccess∣ful by the Vivacity and Courage of General  Goring  's Spirit which was very extraordinary  After this General's going into  France  his Army was solely left to the Disposition of the Lord  Wentworth  who was a very lazy and un∣active Man and was not thought either of In∣terest Experience Courage or Reputation enough for that Trust which was devolved upon him by General  Goring  It was therefore resolved by his Royal Highness that he should rather be advised than commanded and that if his Lordship comported himself with that Tem∣per and Modesty which was expected from him all Resolutions should be formed in the Prince's Council and all Orders should issue in his Lordship's Name for the Relief of  Exeter  for all the Army of Horse was then drawn off from  Exeter  and the Lord  Wentworth  was quartered at  Ashburton  six Miles from  Totnes  and the whole Contribution which was for Support of the Army was taken forcibly by the Lord  Wentworth  's Horse Whereupon the Prince being then at  Totnes  sent for the Lord  Wentworth  who told the Prince in the first Place that he was to declare to his Roy∣al Highness that he could receive no Orders from any Person but his Highness the Lord  Goring  having reposed that Trust in him and talked very imperiously and disrespectfully However the Prince took little Notice of it but the next Day his Lordship being in Drink which was his usual Fault he talked very offensively to the Chancellor whom he always hated tho' of the Prince's Council in Presence of the Prince who being much dissatisfied with the Lord  Wentworth  's Carriage told him he would take the Command of the Army upon himself and issue out the Orders as he should think fit upon which the Lord  Wentworth  troubled and much unsatisfied returned to his Quarters at  Ashburton  which were soon after beaten up by the Enemy at Noon Day and the Army thereby put into great Disorder  Upon this Incident the Lord  Wentworth  went in great Haste to the Prince who was then at  Tavestock  upon the Borders of  Cornwal  and in∣formed the Particulars of his Loss which was not so great as his Lordship imagined The Prince was very desirous to pursue his former Resolution of going to  Totnes  with the Body of his Army but the Lord  Wentworth  told him he believed  the Enemy was possessed of  Totnes  and that he could not so soon recover his Loss nor get his Troops together in any considerable Number till they had some Days Rest and so that De∣sign of the Prince was ended whereas the Rout of the Army was occasioned only by small Parties of the Enemy who came into our Quarters in the Daytime and found no Guards and all their Horses in the Stables Here∣upon his Royal Highness thought fit to go to  Launceston  upon the Borders of  Cornwal  to be farther from the Enemy and commanded the Lord  Wentworth  that all his Horse should be quartered on  Devonshire  Side fearing otherwise that all the Trained Bands of  Cornwal  would run Home to save their Houses from being plun∣dered to which the Lord  Wentworth  's Troops were much addicted who dispersed themselves for many Miles about the Country as if no Enemy was near them and were all comman∣ded by Lord  Wentworth  who challenged them by Deputation from the Lord General  Goring  and the Lord  Wentworth  would submit to no other Command but that of the Prince The Mischief which grew hereupon was much more visible than the Remedy when both Officers and Soldiers by the Looseness and Extrava∣gancy of the Lord  Wentworth  's Government were glad to take any Occasion of Excuse for laying down their Arms And whoever was fit would hardly undertake the Command of a dissolute undisciplined wicked beaten Army upon which he must engage his Honour Howe∣ver  some Resolution was absolutely necessary in that Conjuncture to be taken by the Prince who thereupon declared the Lord  Hopton  should take upon him the Care of the whole Army as being General and the Lord  Wentworth  should be General of the Horse and Collonel  Webb  Major General and Sir  Richard Greenvil  General of the Foot  The Lord  Hopton  being entirely devoted to the King's Interest submitted to the Pleasure of the Prince and told his Royal Highness he would obey him tho' he knew he must lose his Honour But since his Royal Highness thought it necessary to command him he was most ready and willing to obey There was no Suspicion of Sir  Richard Greenvil  because he had been before under the Command of the Lord  Hopton  but it was believed the Lord  Wentworth  who had carried himself more high and imperiously since his disorderly Retreat from  Ashburton  than before would have refu∣sed in which Case the Prince resolved to com∣mit the Lord  Wentworth  and would have given his Command to the Lord  Capel  But much contrary to Expectation Sir  Richard Greenvil  refused who was thereupon forthwith sent Pri∣soner to the  Mount  in  Cornwal  where he was till the Enemy possessed the greatest Part of that County and then that he might not fall in∣to the Hands of the Enemy the Prince permit∣ted his being transported beyond Sea And tho' the Lord  Wentworth  seemed much surpri∣zed with the Prince's Order which he heard  read at the Council Table desired time to con∣sider of it till the next Day that he might confer with his Officers yet the Prince told him sharply that he would not refer his Acts to be scanned by his Officers but that his Lord∣ship should presently give his positive Answer whether he would submit or not To which he submitted and went that Night to his Quar∣ters at which neither the Prince nor his Council nor others were very glad but rather wished he would have obliged the Prince to make other Alterations as the Prince intended because he knew the Lord  Wentworth  's Hu∣mour that he would never chearfully obey  The Prince then hearing of the Loss of  Dart∣mouth  and every Day was News and fearing the Loss of  Exeter  it was thought fit the Lord  Hopton  should march back with his Army to∣wards  Torrington  and that the Prince should not hazard his Person any longer in that open Country but should retire to  Truro  near the nether End of  Cornwal  for his greater Security  Fairfax  having taken  Dartmouth  by Storm the Governour soon surrendered the Castle He then came to  Exeter  which he summoned but having received a stout Answer from Sir  John Berkeley  the Governour he left Sir  Hardress Waller  to finish that Work and went with his Army after the Lord  Hopton  who had fixed himself near  Torrington  and had not been there above four or five Days where he had made some Barricadoes and little Fastnesses but he heard that General  Fairfax  was come within  eight Miles of him However the Lord  Hopton  for good Reasons thought it better to expect the Enemy there than to retire into  Cornwal  with the few that remained of the Trained Bands who would immediately dissolve and run to their Houses and all would soon be de∣stroyed without Fighting and therefore his Lordship chose rather staying where he was notwithstanding the great Disadvantage in Number thinking he might there defend him∣self with greater Advantage than in any other Place Very sharp Disputes were on both Sides and the Lord  Hopton  's Foot behaved themselves with such Courage that they maintained the Fight all that Day till Night retiring still to∣wards  Torrington  but at last being over∣powered by the Numbers of the Enemy who were supplied from time to time with fresh Troops they forced the Barricades the Horse with his Lordship neither charging nor making a Stand but basely ran away in great Con∣fusion leaving their General the Lord  Hopton  who was hurt in the Face with a Pike and his Horse killed under him but receiving a fresh Horse he was obliged to retire to  Strat∣ton  where he stayed some Days till Twelve Hundred of his Foot came up to him Upon his Lordship's retiring the Enemy entered  Torrington  and fell to Pillaging and Plun∣dering the whole Town extreamly but were soon stopt by the Ammunition in the Church taking Fire by what Accident was unknown but it brought a dismal Destruction both upon  the Soldiers and Burghers there being near an Hundred Barrels of Powder in the Church which made a terrible  Fracas  amongst all People which being finished and General  Fairfax  having a little settled  Torrington  he marched after the Lord  Hopton  to  Strat∣ton  whereupon his Lordship retired farther to  Bodmin  and those Horse commanded by the Lord  Wentworth  observed no Orders The Prince went from  Truro  to  Pendennis  Castle and the Lord  Hopton  and the Lord  Capel  advertized his Royal Highness that they had severally received Intelligence of a Design to seize upon the Person of the Prince who there∣upon returned no more to  Truro  but stayed at  Pendennis  Castle and no Person knew the King's Pleasure concerning the Prince but the Lord  Culpepper  and the Chancellor of the Ex∣chequer and they two knowing only what was to be done had no great Confidence that they should have Reputation enough to go thro' with it finding the Earl of  Berkshire  who was then Governour to the Prince jealous of the Design of going into  France  whatever they said to the contrary and the Governour of  Pendennis  Ca∣stle being old and fearful they durst not trust him with the Secret Whereupon they sent Letters forthwith to the Lords  Hopton  and  Capel  to know their Opinion who both agreed that the Prince was immediately without Loss of Time to be transported to  Scilly  which was a Part of  Cornwal  and News being daily brought that our Army was still retiring and  General  Fairfax  advancing after it Resolution was therefore taken that the Prince should that Night embark for  Scilly  a Ship being ready for him then in the Harbour and the Gover∣nour and his Son who was a worthy honest Gentleman were called in to the Prince's Chamber and made acquainted with it and that Night the Prince went on Board and ar∣rived the next Night safe in  Scilly  from whence the Lord  Culpepper  was immediately dispatched to  France  to acquaint the Queen with the Ar∣rival of the Prince in that Island and with the Wants and Incommodities of it and that it was not so strong as reported and therefore his Royal Highness was soon embarked from thence for  France  where they all safely ar∣rived  When the Prince was gone and the Lord  Hopton  left General in  Cornwal  he soon found the Soldiers especially the Horse could not be restrained from Plundering and thereupon his Excellency called a Council of War to con∣sider what was to be done The Lord  Went∣worth  with the principal Officers declared that the Men would never be brought to fight being taken in a worse Trap than they took  Essex  's Army near  Foy  and the Horse Officers proposed to send for a Treaty to which they all agreed except Major General  Webb  The Lord  Hopton  told them he could not consent to a Treaty without Leave from the Prince But whilst the Officers continued their Impor∣tunity a Trumpeter arrived at the same time  from General  Fairfax  with a Letter to the Lord  Hopton  offering a Treaty which his Lordship kept private However the General Officers all assembled and declared if the Lord  Hopton  would not consent to a Treaty they would treat themselves and that in the  Interim  they would neither keep Guards nor do their Duty the Enemy's Horse every Day mingling with them without any Act of Hosti∣lity and bought several of our Soldiers Hor∣ses Then the Lord  Hopton  declared that he would neither treat for himself nor for any of the Garrisons and gave the Horse Leave to treat Whereupon some Persons were presently appointed and Articles were soon concluded and the Army of Horse was dissolved and every Horseman who had not sold his Horse had Twenty Shillings with a Passport from Gene∣ral  Fairfax  to go home to their Houses and there to live quietly without engaging farther in the Wars and many of our Soldiers had sold and exchanged so many good Horses for pitiful Jades they received from the Enemy that they would not give Twenty Shillings apiece for them and so many Hundred of Sol∣diers went Home on Horseback with their Passes from the General that the Lord  Hopton  was obliged to treat with the Enemy tho' he would have no Article for himself nor be men∣tioned in the Treaty After which his Lord∣ship with the Lord  Wentworth  Lord  Capel  and Major General  Webb  went to the  Mount  in  Cornwal  from whence they were transpor∣ted  to  Scilly  and from thence were embarqued for  France  The King being now reduced to the lowest Condition that possibly could be having lost all his Forces most of his Garrisons taken and yielded and General  Fairfax  having cleared the West was marching to besiege  Oxford  The King being there began to think of some Way for his Escape and Safety and being treacherously invited by the  Scots  to put him∣self under the Protection of their Army then at the Siege of  Newark  his Majesty went dis∣guised from  Oxford  in  April  accompa∣nied only with Mr  John Ashburnham  a Groom of his Bedchamber and Mr  Hudson  a Mini∣ster few or none else being acquainted with his Design but all were amazed when they heard he was arrived in the  Scotch  Camp he having been beforehand promised Security for himself and those he brought with him or that should come to him tho' they denied both in Word and Act as plainly appeared by their delivering him to the Parliament a Prisoner for Two Hundred Thousand Pounds  Sterling  And that the  Scots  may be the better known I shall give you their Character by one who was well acquainted with their wicked Princi∣ples He tells us  They are a People who de∣light to enslave others yet are of a slavish Con∣dition themselves a People whose Freedom is Service whose Mercies are Cruelties whose Religion is only Formality whose Government is Tyranny a Generation of Vipers and Hypo∣crites  whom no Oaths or Covenants can bind no Courtesy or Civility oblige  Thus the King was delivered Prisoner to the Parliament by the  Scots  and by the Parliament sent Prisoner to  Holmby  and from thence he was soon after forcibly taken away and carried to the Army by Cornet  Joyce  who being asked by the Parliament Commissioners who then waited upon the King by what Authority he did it He answered it was by the Pleasure of the Army and that the King should be with them with Honour and in Safety This Action startled the Parliament extreamly who from this time began to surrender themselves and their Power into the Hands of their own Army The General in his Letter to the Parliament makes the King's Remove from  Holmby  to be by his own Consent tho' certainly it was not so tho' it might be without the General's Knowledge And the Lord  Dumfermling  ac∣quainted the Parliament that the King com∣manded him to tell them that his Majesty was unwillingly taken away by a Party from the Army and that he desired both Houses to maintain the Laws of the Land and that he might be obliged to sign many things in that Condition and that he would not have them be believed till they had farther Notice from his Majesty  Thus we see the Inconstancy of Men and the Uncertainty of worldly Affairs The Offi∣cers and Soldiers of an Army tho' never so successful and well disciplined will for want  of Action fall into Discord and Designs of Trouble A victorious Army out of Employ∣ment is very inclinable to assume Power over their Leaders When the Parliament had Con∣quest and Success after their own Desires yet they were strangely encumbered with the Mu∣tinery of their Army on the one Side and with discontented Petitions on the other besides the Petulancy of many Pamphlets which daily flew abroad against their Proceedings Many believed there was some private Treaty at this time by some Officers of the Army with the King and that Instructions were given for it by  Cromwell  that if the King would assent to their Proposals which were much lower than those of the Parliament the Army would then settle the King upon his Throne The King in his own Judgment seemed inclined to it and therefore disdained the Parliament's Propositi∣ons and would rely upon the Proposals of the Army and urged a Treaty upon them The  Scots  complain of the King's being taken from  Holmby  by Force and would not apply to the Army since it ought to be under the Com∣mand of the Parliament They declared that their Stability and Happiness did much depend upon the Safety and Preservation of the King's Person and that they would endeavour to com∣pose the unhappy Differences and therefore desire the Propositions may be proceeded upon by the mutual Consent of both Kingdoms and desire there might be a present Treaty with the King and that he might come to  London  with  Safety Honour and Freedom The King being then passionately sensible of the lan∣guishing and unsettled State of the Kingdom and of their great Distractions pressed earnest∣ly for a Peace and was most willing to testify to all the World his Readiness to contribute his utmost Endeavours for it But the Parliament then thought the King was too much in the Army's Interest who were then contriving their main Design of coming up to  London  to curb both Parliament and City and to make them act according to their Prescriptions  About this time the Agitators were set up who were some Soldiers elected out of each Re∣giment of Horse and Foot to meet and consult by that Name who undertook to understand and regulate the chief Affairs of the Army These Men were very busy and the King was privately informed whether by Design of the Army was not known but supposed by most to be so that the Agitators intended some Vio∣lence to the King's sacred Person and there∣fore the King was privately perswaded to make an Escape if possible and contrived by Sir  John Berkeley  Collonel  Leg  and Mr  John Ashburnham  who provided a Ship at  Southamp∣ton  and Horses were to be ready at  Hampton  Ferry on the other Side for the King's Escape And that which gave most Suspicion that the Army designed the King's Escape was that Collonel  Whaley  who had the Guard of the King's Person did that very Day give the King a Letter which he said was put into his Hand  by an unknown Person giving a blind Account of the Agitators Intention to take away the King's Life for the Good of the Nation and that very Night  Cromwell  sent a Letter to in∣form the Parliament that the King was escaped the Manner thus  The Officers who attended the King won∣dering he came not forth of his Chamber to Supper having been long in writing they went into his Chamber and missed him with∣in half an Hour after he was gone and his Cloak was carelessly cast upon the Ground in his Way to the Waterside and this following Letter was left upon the Table written with his own Hand to be communicated to the Parliament in these Words following  That Liberty the King now generally preten∣ded to and aimed at was as necessary for Kings as any other That he had a long Time endured Captivity hoping it might tend to the Settlement of a good Peace but finding the contrary and the Unfixedness of the Army and new Guards set upon him he had withdrawn himself That wherever he should be he would earnestly labour for settling a good Peace and to prevent the Effusion of more Blood and if he might be heard with Freedom Honour and Safety he would instantly break through his Cloud of Re∣tirement and shew himself ready to be  Pater Patriae Upon reading this Letter and  Crom∣well  's Information it was ordered in Parlia∣ment That it should be Loss of Life and Estate for any one to conceal or detain the  King's Person and not to discover it to both Houses of Parliament  Upon the King's Escape the Parliament sent all Ways to find him but in the dark rainy cloudy Night the King was lost in  Windsor  Forest and passing in the Morning thro'  Farn∣ham  to the Seaside his Majesty missed his Design of going to  Jersey  the Ship failing to be at the Place if any Place was really ap∣pointed which was promised and the Want of it caused some Reflections upon the Underta∣ker who was very well known to me The King fearing a Discovery of him could by no Means be prevented it was resolved that the Kjng and Collonel  Leg  should lodge that Night at  Tedsworth  at the House of the Countess Dowager of  Southampton  which was near the Sea and that the other two should ferry over to the Isle of  Wight  to find Collonel  Ham∣mond  under whole Assurance for his Brother's sake Dr  Hammond  the King hoped for some Friendship and Fidelity This Design was ac∣cordingly put in Execution and Sir  John Berkeley  and Mr  Ashburnham  were both told by the King that unless Collonel  Hammond  gave his Oath and Faith of Preservation Protection Secrecy and Freedom to the King's Person at all Times they should not discover any more than signify in general the King's Escape from the imminent Danger of Assassination That the King's Desire led him to cast himself upon Collonel  Hammond  for Protection which if he should refuse and secure the Persons of Sir  John Berkeley  and  Ashburnham  the King and  Leg  by their not returning at the Time prefixed might have Opportunity to dispose of themselves otherwise These two being dispatch'd the King sent  Leg  to the Countess to tell her that a Person of Quality her dear Friend desired the Privacy of her House that Night without Discovery to which she readily consented On  Sunday  Mor∣ning the two Messengers got into the Island and met Collonel  Hammond  on his Way towards  Newport  whom they acquainted with the Bu∣siness The Collonel told them he wished the King's Safety as his own Soul that he should not be inquisitive where the King was but were he in his Custody his Oath and Interest to the Parliament being in Ballance he should be safe from Violence but for the Freedom and Liberty of his Person he could not an∣swer it to his Superiours This Answer tho' not satisfactory nor according to their Com∣mission yet they being loath to be taken in∣to Custody or for what other Reason none can tell came over with the Collonel and a Guard to the House of the Countess and  Ash∣burnham  went up Stairs to the King's Chamber and told the King Collonel  Hammond  was be∣low at Supper and had given Assurance of Ho∣nour for his Majesty's Safety but not of Li∣berty for his Person which the King hearing in Passion struck his Hand upon his Breast and replied to  Ashburnham And is this all Then I am betrayed Ashburnham  and  Berkeley  sorry for their great Misadvisedness would have made  some desperate Attempt to have killed  Hammond  which the King would not admit of and in this Extremity with a seeming Willingness the King went over with them and with Collonel  Hammond  to  Carisbrook  Castle Collonel  Ham∣mond  immediately acquaints the Parliament with the King's being there who forthwith vote the King should stay there that none who had bore Arms against the Parliament should stay in the Island excepting such Inhabitants as had compounded that no Delinquent or Foreigner should be admitted to the King's Pre∣sence without Leave of Parliament that those Persons who attended the King thither should be sent to the Parliament which Collonel  Ham∣mond  refused and also complained that the Conditions for the King were not suitable to his Quality Thus that unhappy King fell out of one Trap into another and sends his Message to the Parliament why he did not receive their Propositions for Peace which they sent him to  HamptonCourt  because the Commissioners from  Scotland  presented him the same Day with a Declaration against those Propositions in the Name of the Kingdom of  Scotland  Here we may take notice of the perplexed Condition of the Parliament the Army raised commissioned and paid by them making War against them and with their Swords in Hand controul their Masters and had a Design to carry away the King from the Isle of  Wight  but were prevented by the General the City the Parliament's old Friends and Assistants  are averse towards them and question their Integrity reproach them and would cast them off the King writes to the Parliament and taxes them for not answering his last Message and earnestly presses for a present Treaty that Peace might be settled and lays the Retarding it upon them The  Scotch  Commissioners declare a joint Interest with the Parliament for settling a Peace in both Kingdoms protest against the four Bills sent to the King press for a present Treaty at  London  saying  Let that be given to  God  which is  God  's and that to  Caesar  which is  Caesar  's  and put them in Mind of their professed Loyalty Collonel  Hammond  has more strict Orders to secure the King and se∣veral of the King's Servants which attended him are discharged Then the Parliament send Commissioners to the King who return with∣out Satisfaction and after a long Debate the prevailing Party in the House of Commons vote no more Addresses to the King and no Message or Letters to be received from him and that it should be High Treason for any to deliver any Message to the King or receive any from him without the Leave of both Houses of Parlia∣ment and Collonel  Hammond  with Sir  Wil∣liam Constable  had Orders to place and displace such Persons about the King as they thought fit which highly discontented the King but the Governour said he had Orders from the Par∣liament for it whom he must obey  Soon after this the General presents an Ad∣dress to the Parliament in the Name of the  whole Army that they would stand by the Parliament in making no more Addresses to the King and that they would intirely submit to the Government of the Parliament Thus they are quickly made Friends again and the Army had the Thanks of the Houses for their Address who ordered the King's Houshold should be dissolved and the Navy no longer be called the King's Navy Whereupon the  Hollanders  as they had Reason refused to strike Sail as being the elder State Two Earls were named to go to  Scotland  to acquaint that Kingdom with what the Parliament had done and a Declaration was published for no more Addresses to the King wherein all the Miscar∣riages of the Government were named from the King's first coming to the Crown  Thus the Parliament and Army were made Friends and well fixed again by the Cunning of of  Cromwell  and his Party but then the Appren∣tices with others in  London  made an Insurrection against the Parliament and Army and great Pre∣parations were making in  Scotland  for a War declaring they would rescue the King from Im∣prisonment which was done contrary to the Re∣solution of both Kingdoms and that the King might come to one of his own Houses near  London  with Honour Freedom and Safety And Infor∣mation came from  Scotland  that the King's Party there was very strong and carried all and that there would be a general Rising in that Kingdom for Religion King and Church and the Chan∣cellor of  Scotland  by Order of their Parlia∣ment  demanded that the King might come to some of his Courts near  London  with Free∣dom Honour and Safety and that a personal Treaty be had with his Majesty and that the Independant Schismatick Army might be dis∣banded which governed all as they pleased Whereupon the Parliament returned Answer That they would keep the Covenant and the Treaty between the two Kingdoms and that they would be ready to join with  Scotland  in the Propositions presented to the King at  New∣market  About this time or a little before the Duke of  York  made his Escape into  Holland  and was very tenderly and kindly received by the Prince and Princess of  Orange  at whose Escape the Parliament was very much troubled and now Petitions came from several Parts of  England  and Risings were in several Counties and the People in general were weary of the War and would have a personal Treaty with the King And Risings were not only at Land but In∣formation came that several Ships were revol∣ted from  Rainsborough  whom they had set on Shore and sent for the Earl of  Warwick  to command them who was thereupon declared Admiral Thus a new War was begun and great Divisions and Perplexities were in Parlia∣ment and yet the Risings in several Parts for the King not being well concerted were still quashed and did only serve to unite the Party stronger against the King However the Par∣liament seeing that the People's Hearts were  generally set against them and that the revol∣ted Ships at  Deal  would not own them finding their Backwardness for a personal Treaty with the King and that the City of  London  and Offi∣cers of the Trained Bands prayed the King might be brought to  London  with Freedom Honour and Safety to treat with the Parlia∣ment and that the City would engage for the Security of his Majesty's Royal Person and would also undertake to keep the Parliament safe from all Tumults and Mutinery and that they would defend the King and Parliament in the Treaty and defray the Charge of the Guards during the Treaty and find a conveni∣ent Place for the Treaty with many other Particulars The Parliament hereupon began to think of a Treaty and to set aside their Votes of NonAddresses In the mean time these several Petitions for Peace encouraged the Duke of  Buckingham  with his Brother with the Earls of  Holland  and  Peterborough  to a Rising about  Kingston  where they were soon pursued and the Earl of  Holland  who had formerly had a great Hand in bringing Straits upon the King and Kingdom in the Beginning of the War now seeing the Parliament backward to a personal Treaty hoped they should be able in the End to bring the Parliament to Reason But the Parliament's Army being old Soldiers prospe∣rous in their Attempts and well provided with all Necessaries it was a desperate Attempt to make Head against them without having be∣fore concerted all things well which was a  great Prejudice to the King's Affairs there being small Trust to be given to People's Promises in such Occasions who would not stir unless they saw the Tide turning with some previous Success which was at that time very unhappy to the King's Affairs in all Parts tho' nothing could be more honourable just and pious than to endeavour rescuing our Country from the Misery and Slavery it lay under and our Sins were certainly the Cause it took Effect joined with the Mismanagement of those who undertook it without having first well concerted for the carrying on that Design So that the Earl of  Holland  's Party was totally defeated himself with many others taken Pri∣soners and the Brother to the Duke of  Buck∣ingham  and others killed Then Duke  Hamil∣ton  enters  England  with an Army and all join∣ing with him are declared Rebels Here is a strange Turn of Affairs to which all human Actions are subject Great Endeavours were formerly used to bring in the  Scots  to assist the Parliament and now they invade  England  with a considerable Army they joined before with the Parliament against the King and now they took with the King against the Parliament The People of this World are like the Sea still eb∣bing and flowing always in an uncertain Mo∣tion constant in nothing but Inconstancy  The Prince of  Wales  and Duke of  York  did at this time come to  Yarmouth  Road with divers Ships and landed some Men but were beaten by the Parliament's Horse and several taken  Prisoners but the Town rescued them and the rest of his Royal Highness's Men got into the Town The Lord  Willoughby  of  Parham  was on Shipboard and commanded the Prince's Fleet having quitted the Parliament upon their declining a personal Treaty and when the Earl of  Warwick  came near him with the Parliament Fleet the Lord  Willoughby  was ve∣ry earnest to have fought upon Assurance that several in the Fleet would have revolted to his Royal Highness but those that were about the Prince disswaded him from Fighting preten∣ding great Danger to his Highness's Person and so they carried it Whereas in all Probability as the Seamens Affections then stood the Par∣liament's Fleet would have been endangered The Prince then stopped several Merchants Ships and sent to the Merchants Adventurers at  London  for Twenty Thousand Pounds  Ster∣ling  to release their Ships and that he was come with that Fleet to endeavour to release his Majesty from his Imprisonment  The Parliament seeing the General Inclina∣tion of the People was for a Treaty they fell from their Vote of NonAddresses and ordered a personal Treaty with the King in the Isle of  Wight  with Honour Freedom and Safety in what Place there his Majesty should appoint who well approved of  Newport  and received the Parliament Commissioners with much Chear∣fulness declaring that no Man desired a Peace so much as he and that he would hearken to any Motion that might conduce to so good an  End and that whoever gained by the Troubles he was sure to be a Loser and challenged all Men to produce the least Colour of Reason that he was against the Treaty He then said if it was Peace they desired he had shewed them the Way by a just Compliance with all their Interests If they desired Plenty and Happi∣ness they were the inseparable Effects of Peace If it was Security he offered the Militia for all his Time If it was a Liberty of Consci∣ence he that wanted it most was most willing to give it If it was the right Administration of Justice all Officers and Offices of Trust he left to the Choice of the Parliament If they would have frequent Parliaments he fully con∣curred therewith If they demanded the Ar∣rears of the Army which fought against him he fully agreed they should be paid So that all the World might see his unwearied Endea∣vours for Peace  The Lords and Commons agreed that the Vote against farther Addresses should be recalled That the King had chosen  Newport  in the Isle of  Wight  to treat with the Parliament's Commis∣sioners and all such Persons should be admit∣ted as his Majesty should think fit to send for That Collonel  Hammond  's Instructions for keep∣ing the King should be repealed taking the King's own Engagement for his going abroad in the Island and Horses Coaches and Mo∣ney both for the publick and the King's pri∣vate Use were sent to the Isle of  Wight  where the King kept a Fast for a Blessing upon the  Treaty and agreed in every thing except Re∣ligion wherein he let the Commissioners know how far he could condescend Some of the Commissioners then begged of the King upon their Knees with Tears in their Eyes as to the Proposition touching Religion but Matter of Conscience prevailed more with the King than all their Arguments of which they gave an Account to the Parliament who thereupon vo∣ted that the King's Concessions as to Religion the Church and  Ireland  were unsatisfactory However the House of Commons voted that a Committee should draw up something for the King's coming to  London  with Instructions for the Terms of his Majesty's being in Freedom Honour and Safety That the Committee should also consider of the King's Desires concerning his Revenues That an Act of Obli∣vion should be presented to the King to be passed with such Limitations as shall be agreed by both Houses The House of Commons vote likewise that the King should come to  London  so soon as the Concessions in the Treaty were agreed and that the King should have his Lands and Revenues made good to him according to the Laws and that what he should pass away of his legal Right he should have Allowance in Compensation And that an Act of Oblivion should be agreed upon And both Houses agreed to all these Votes and in fine the Par∣liament voted that the King's Concessions to the Propositions of the Parliament upon the Treaty were sufficient Grounds for settling the  Peace of the Kingdom and they named a Com∣mittee to go to the General and Head Quarters to confer with the General and Officers of the Army for the Continuance of a good Corre∣spondence betwixt the Parliament and Army  But whilst these things were doing Collonel  Hammond  sends a Letter to the Parliament with one inclosed from the General unto him requiring him to repair to his Excellency at the Head Quarters and that Collonel  Ewre  was appointed to take Charge of the King in the Isle of  Wight  Hereupon the Commons voted That Collonel  Hammond  should stay in the Isle of  Wight  and continue his Charge and that the Admiral should forthwith send Ships for Security of the Isle of  Wight  and that they should obey Collonel  Hammond  But a Messen∣ger brought Word that Collonel  Hammond  was upon his Way to  Windsor  according to the Ge∣neral's Order and that Collonel  Ewre  had se∣cured his Majesty's Person and removed him to  Hurst  Castle a pitiful Place and most pesti∣lential Air Hereupon the Parliament sent a Letter to the General acquainting him that those Orders and Instructions from him to Col∣lonel  Ewre  for securing the King's Person were contrary to their Resolution and fresh Instructions were sent again by the Parliament to Collonel  Hammond  to return and attend his Charge in the Isle of  Wight  and that it was the Pleasure of the Parliament that his Excellency should recal his Orders and that Collonel  Hammond  should again attend his  Charge but Collonel  Hammond  sent Word to the Parliament that he was detained at  Wind∣sor  and that Collonel  Ewre  had the Charge of the King At the same time the General wrote to the Lord Mayor of  London  that he was up∣on his March with his Army towards  London  and demanded Fourty Thousand Pounds  Ster∣ling  immediately of the City and that he would quarter his Army in the void Houses near the City as  Whitehall St James  the  Mews York House  c  Upon this Advance of the Army all Persons were full of Perplexity not knowing the End of it The Parliament then declared the sei∣zing of the King's Royal Person was without their Advice and against their Consent and the House being to sit the next Day Collonel  Pride  with several of his Regiments stood in the Court of Requests upon the Stairs in the Lobby before the House of Commons  Pride  having a Paper of Names in his Hand and the Lord  Gray  of  Grooby  stood by him to inform him who the Members were and  Pride  seized upon such as the Lord directed by his Note and sent them away with Soldiers by special Order from the General and Council of Offi∣cers The House of Commons being informed of this sent their Serjeant at Arms to the Mem∣bers seized upon to let them know it was the Pleasure of the House that they should forth∣with attend the Service of the House but they were still detained by the Guard of Officers  The Army having thus ejected the greatest and best Part of the House of Commons brought the rest so to their Will whom they permitted to sit that they acted nothing but by their Di∣ctates and in pursuance of their Designs which were to subvert Monarchy and to bury it in one Grave with the King and having contri∣ved with this Juncto of the House of Commons how to bring the King to his End which they soon resolved upon with a strange unheard of Impudence in a pretended Way of Justice whose Death the Juncto had long before re∣solved upon and their Design being now ripe a Resolution was taken which amazed the whole Christian World of which past Ages had ne∣ver any Precedent nor may any future Age take Example by this most barbarous and hor∣rid Cruelty to bring a just King their lawful Sovereign who prized his Subjects Liberties and Welfare before his own Life to be ad∣judged by his most rebellious Subjects and condemned to die by a pretended Legality and Cloak of Justice with mock Formalities of Law and Villainy of so deep a Dye that all the World blush at being the Masterpiece of all Iniquities which they thought better than to have poisoned their King in  Carisbrook  Castle  And when the nauseous pestilential Air of  Hurst  Castle effected not what they designed then they carried him with a strong Guard to  Windsor  in order to his intended Tryal deny∣ing him not only the Ceremony of the Knee but even the common Civility of the Hat  The King being brought from  Windsor  to  St James  their Juncto of Parliament proceed to Votes in order to his Tryal and declare That by the fundamental Laws of the Land it was Treason in the King of  England  to le∣vy War against his Parliament and Kingdom and all the Blood spilt was by the Juncto laid upon the King who was the greatest Sufferer in the War which was made and begun upon him and what the King did was purely in his own Defence who endeavoured to stop that Flux of Blood by a Treaty with his two Hou∣ses of Parliament which was agreed upon but hindered by the imperious Army who were so audacious as to style the King in their unpa∣rallelled rebellious Remonstrance the King∣dom's capital Enemy who was formerly con∣demned for yielding too little to his Parliament and was now to be condemned by the Army for yielding too much He was formerly im∣prisoned for making War and now was to be condemned for making Peace He was at first condemned for having evil Counsellours and was now to be condemned having no Counsel and all this to be done by Wolves in Sheeps Clothing who pretended only Zeal when their Hearts were filled with Blood and were resolved from Servants to become Masters to bring in Democracy by abolishing Monarchy declaring in their Charge by that impudent ArchTraitor  Bradshaw  That the King of  Eng∣land  is entrusted by the People with a limited Power to govern according to the Laws of the  Land and not otherwise and that by his Trust Oath and Office he is obliged to use the Pow∣er committed to him for the Good and Bene∣fit of the People and for Preservation of their Rights and Liberties and where the King fails in any of these and rules and governs according to his Will he thereby commits Treason and may be impeached as a Traitor and Murderer A Doctrine never heard of before even amongst the most barbarous Nations it evidently ap∣pearing that the Authority of Kings is imme∣diately derived from God and not conferred upon them as a Trust from the People They are called the  Ministers of God and the Powers that be are ordained of God  When God first subjected his own People to the Government of Kings the People had no∣thing to do in conferring the Power  Moses  was made King and Ruler by God himself so  Joshua  and the  Judges  for so long Theocracy did continue visible amongst Men And when the People desired a King God was not angry with them for desiring it for he had before told them that they should have a King but for some Irregularities in the Manner of their de∣siring it neither was the King chosen by the People but by Lot and no Hand of the Peo∣ple in chusing him  David  was made King by God's immediate Choice but after him the Government descended by Succession And no History either sacred or profane can shew any Footsteps that the People did entrust their Power to their Kings which Supposition is  built upon the mere Strength of their own Ima∣gination And if we take a View of all the Ways whereby Princes ascend to the Throne it will appear they are but few and yet in none of them the People confer the Power on the King  First by Descent and Succession as in  Eng∣land  the People do not confer the Power I know very well at the King's Coronation the Consent of the People is demanded yet the King is King to all Intents and Purposes before his Coronation Besides all the People are not summoned nor any considerable Part of them appear at the Coronation And if any should reject his Prince that would not hinder the Coronation which is barely a thing of Course and does not deduce the King's Power from the People Nay some Kings have de∣ferred their Coronation being only a Ceremo∣ny In the next Place if a King gets the Crown by Conquest no Man can say he re∣ceives the Crown by Consent of the People tho' there be a tacit Consent in their yielding him Obedience As for those who surprize a King∣dom by Fraud they may impose upon the Peo∣ple so as to gain a formal Consent yet there is not a real Consent in those that are thus cajoled by the People who had a Hand in bringing them in  There are some that come to the Crown by Election and here the People think the King derives his Power from them believing the Throne was vacant and make Stipulations with him that is to govern But we must consider  that there is much Difference betwixt designing the Person and conferring the Power the for∣mer is from them that chuse the latter by no means The Dean and Chapter of a Cathedral by the King's Leave chuse a Bishop  Sede va∣cante  this Choice designs the Person but does not confer the Power which is afterwards gi∣ven him in his Consecration The Aldermen and Commons of a City do yearly chuse their Mayors this Choice shews the Person but does not confer the Power which he hath by the King's Charter When the Electors chuse an Emperor or the States of  Poland  chuse their King they only design his Person his Power is not from them but immediately from God But supposing that in the first Institution of Monarchy the People did confer the Power upon the Prince it doth not therefore follow that it lyes in the Power of the People to re∣voke it tho' this was unlawfully maintained against King  Charles  I and since by some People holding the same Principles who would have the King's Power to be a Trust committed to him by the People and so revocable which is a very false Supposition and the Superstructure upon it must needs fall in Course and yet supposing it was true the Revocableness does not follow  Both Law and Reason tell us that what is absolutely conferred in any Compact is not to be revoked When the Aldermen and Common Council have chosen a Lord Mayor it does not lye in their Power to reassume the Trust into their own Hands When the Knights of the  Shire are chosen to sit in Parliament it does not lye in the Freeholders Power afterwards to re∣cal their Trust They might have forbore to commit the Trust but they cannot recal it Then the Accountableness of Princes to their People in their Representatives hath passed for current Doctrine in the last Age by Impri∣soning Trying and Condemning their lawful King whereas no earthly Power can justly call their King in Question God Almighty be∣ing the only Ruler of Princes and to him alone they owe their Accounts by whom all Kings reign and cannot be called to any Account in this World but by the Stings of their own Consciences And it is a plain Contradiction after we have owned the King to be Supreme to affirm there is any other Superior to him that can call him to an Account it being a known Maxim  Par in parem not habet Pote∣statem  If then the King be Supreme and there be others in his Kingdom that are Su∣perior to him then he is Supreme and not Supreme But the  English  pretend they are un∣der Stipulations of a conditional Obedience provided the King maintains their Rights so that the King not performing the former they are not bound to the latter Whereas we are certainly bound to Subjection irrespectively to a  Caligula  as well as to an  Augustus  to cruel  Nero  and  Domitian  as well as to courteous  Vespasian  to the Apostate  Julian  as well as to Christian  Constantine  because they have equal∣ly their Power from God  The  Jews  were commanded to pray for the Prosperity of their Governours and the Peace of  Babylon  and for the Lives of  Nebuchadne∣zar  and  Balthazar  and this was performed in the first and purest Ages They were to pray for their Emperors and Kings irrespective∣ly to their Religion or Opinions in it even for their Heathen Persecutors And if they must pray for them they must not certainly take up Arms against them And if we must not touch the Lord's Anointed our Assassina∣tion of him is contrary to our not touching him  Tertullian  is certainly a competent Wit∣ness for  Septimius Severus  and  Dionysius  of  Alexandria  for  Valerianus  and  Gallienus  the  Gallican  Church prayed for  Alericus  the Eastern for the Emperor  Valerius  an  Arian  and for  Theodosius  the Younger and  Valentinian  III the one a  Nestorian  the other a dissolute Per∣son and their Prayers were that God would grant them long Life and a secure Reign and preserve their Families in Safety and their Government in Peace which are perfectly in∣consistent with Attempts on their Persons or Practices to disturb the Tranquillity of their Government The very endeavouring it is perfectly opposite to the Tenor of the Old Testa∣ment and of the Gospel King  David  com∣mitted those two great Sins of Murder and Adultery either of which singly was capital by the  Jewish  Law and yet we do not find him called to an Account for them Nay in his penitential Confession he only looks up to  God and says  Against thee only have I sinned  Which is an Instance by which all Men should be guided Besides for the People to have a Power to call their Prince to an Account is highly inconsistent with the Law of Nature and is against all Reason and Conscience for by this the People are both Complainants Witnesses Jury and Judges a thing never heard of in any judicial Proceeding And yet that hellish Juncto of Parliament made a High Court of Justice as they called what was the Height of Injustice and the utmost Wickedness to Try and Con∣demn their lawful Sovereign Such was the monstrous Impiety of the last Age when that incomparable Monarch the Honour of the World was forced to bow down his Head and fall a sad Sacrifice to the Fury of the most bar∣barous Villains that ever appeared upon the Stage of this World when Men threw away a Felicity always to be reflected on but never to be recovered to the World's End  Thus fell the best of Kings whose Greatness of Judgment as well as that of his Condition did eminently appear at his Death in the Cle∣mency of his Nature even in pardoning the Trea∣son and Malice of his most inveterate Enemies who were not satisfied with his Blood but un∣hinged the best of Governments and brought up∣on the  English  Nation nothing but Confusion and Misery And having thus murdered their King they took Possession of his Kingdom disinherited as much as in them lay the lawful Heir and by their Proclamation declared themselves a Free  State But before I go farther give me Leave to give you this King's Character  He was no great Scholar his Learning con∣sisted more in what he had seen than what he had studied His Judgment was good and bet∣ter than most of his Ministers The Misfor∣tune was that he seldom depended upon it unless in Matters of his own Religion where∣in he was always very stiff His Arguing was beyond Measure civil and patient He would seldom or never contradict any Man angrily but would always say by your Favour I think otherwise or I am not of your Opinion He would discourage any bold Address that was made to him and did not love Strangers and whilst he was upon his Throne he would per∣mit none to enter abruptly with him into Bu∣siness He was wiser than most of his Coun∣cil yet so unhappy as seldom to follow his own Judgment He would always whilst in his Court be addressed to by proper Ministers and still kept up the Dignity of his Court limiting all Persons to Places suitable to their Employ∣ments and Quality and would there only hear them unless he called for them in particular Besides the Ladies and Women who attended the King he permitted no Minister to have his Wife in Court He spake but slowly and would stammer a little when he began to speak eagerly He seldom or never made his own Dispatches till his latter Days but would still mend and alter them and to that Purpose he would often say he found it better to be a  Cabler than a Shoemaker As to his Religion he was very positive in it and would bear no Arguments against it  When the Juncto had finished their sad Tra∣gedy we soon saw what followed their dismal Actings for having got the supreme Power into their Hands they were resolved to over∣act all those who should oppose their tyran∣nical Proceedings Neither could there be then a greater Crime than Loyalty whilst That was only made Treason and the Servants having got the Sword into their Hands they resolved to improve it to their Security And having then a Set of Men fit for their Turns which were the Juncto they would be sure that none of those who concluded the late King's Con∣cessions a sufficient Ground for Settlement of Peace should sit amongst them but should be voted out of the House and be no more admitted to sit as Members And having thus settled their own House they in the next Place fell upon the House of Lords and vote That the House of Peers in Parliament was useless and dange∣rous and by an Act of theirs did abolish it but yet that they might have the Privilege to be elected Knights of the Shire and Burgesses which was first willingly embraced by the Earl of  Pembroke  who would play at small Game rather than sit out but the rest of the Lords sensible of that strange Alteration of the fun∣damental Government of the Nation published the  r Protestation against it in the Name of all the Peers of the Realm being a treasonable  Proceeding and tyrannical Usurpation of some Members of the House of Commons being a few insolent and traitorous Members of that House while the better and greatest Part of the House were forcibly detained from thence But it was in vain to think by Protestation to re∣duce those Men to Reason who had Swords by their Sides and were resolved to overcome or perish in Maintainance of their usurped Au∣thority and abolishing whatever was right as most likely to oppose their Intrusion And therefore they declared in the Name of the Commons of  England  assembled in Parliament tho' they were not the tenth Part of their Number that they found by Experience the Office of a King in  England  and to have the Power thereof in any one single Person was unnecessary and dangerous to the Liberty Safety Religion and the publick Interest of the Nation and therefore should be abolished And to the End that all Persons might more readily yield Obedience to their usurped Power they were absolved from all Oaths made to their late Sovereign and his Posterity  Thus this small Part of a seeming Parliament which was actually dissolved by the King's Death acted by the Dictates of the Council of War for the Juncto were only the Wheels of the Government guided by the Will and Pleasure of the Army or rather their Tools by which they acted who yet thought them∣selves not strong enough till a third Power was set up by them to strengthen them in their  Usurpation This they called a Council of State consisting of Forty Persons most of which were principal Officers of the Army to whom Power was given to settle the Militia of  England  and  Ireland  and to dispose of it from time to time as they should think fit and that they should execute their Powers for a Year and an Oath was made whereby each Member admitted to that Council was to declare That he approved what the House of Commons and their High Court of Justice had done against the late King and their abolishing the Kingly Government and House of Lords and that the legislative and supreme Power was wholly in the House of Commons This Oath Twenty One of the Forty they had named refused to take but their Number was soon filled up by them of as large Consciences as themselves  About this time  Cromwell  having been victo∣rious in  Ireland  and almost conquered all there left his SoninLaw  Ireton  Deputy in  Ireland  to perfect the Conquest of that Kingdom and comes over himself to  London  where he was much caressed by all the Officers of the new Commonwealth for so the Juncto had declared  England  to be and now the Juncto fearing lest  Charles  II should join Interest with the  Scots  they provided against a Storm from thence and ordered a considerable Body of their Troops to lye upon the Borders near  Scotland  and having an Account that the  Scots  had modelled an Ar∣my with which they were preparing to enter  England Cromwell  with some other General  Officers were appointed to meet and confer with General  Fairfax  and to perswade him that the  English  Army then upon the Borders of  Scotland  might forthwith enter into that Kingdom and carry the War into their Country But the General would not be satisfied in his Con∣science to do that being of the same Religion with them notwithstanding all the Arguments that  Cromwell  and the other Officers could use to perswade him In fine he told them plain∣ly he would rather lay down his Commission than agree with them which was indeed the great Design of those Officers that then met and so they would press the General no farther whose Commission was presently accepted by the Juncto of Parliament and  Cromwell  was made forthwith General in  Fairfax  's Place and being General he readily marched with his Army Northwards to the great Amazement of the  Scots  who fearing an Invasion al∣ledged the Covenant and the Articles of Paci∣fication by which they ought not to be inva∣ded without three Months Warning  The first News that General  Cromwell  heard from  Scotland  was that King  Charles  II was landed there and received as their King and that it was resolved to invade  England  if the  English  Army did not invade them But that the  Scots  first thought fit to send to the Juncto of Par∣liament to know whether the  English  Marching towards  Scotland  was in a Defensive or an Of∣fensive Way Whereupon the Juncto published in a Declaration their Reasons for their Army  marching Northwards The  Scots  forthwith chose a particular Council by whose Advice and Direction their King was to govern who gave such general Satisfaction to the  Scots  that by Proclamation published at  Edinburgh  Cross they gave the King all his Royal Power where∣upon  Cromwell  advanced and sent his Reasons into  Scotland  of his March with his Army in∣to that Kingdom and soon after advanced to  Dunbar  where both Armies were near each other but the  English  beginning to want Pro∣visions  Cromwell  resolved to retreat before his Army was put to Extremity But the  Scots  pressed hard upon them and the Presbyterian Ministers in the Army encouraged the  Scots  to fight contrary to the Opinion of their Gene∣ral and other principal Officers who advised rather to make a Bridge for the  English  Army to pass quietly homewards than to hinder or oppose them But the Ministers carried for Fighting and the Day before the Engagement the  Scots  seemed so sure of Victory by Encou∣ragement from their Ministers who said it was the Lord's Battle that they consulted of sen∣ding Propositions to the  English  that they should have Leave to pass into  England  with their Swords only leaving their Cannon and Ammunition behind them 'Tis true the  English  were then in a very sad Condition many sick and wanting Provisions the Passes before them stopt the  Scots  Army on one Side of them the Sea on the other and the Kingdom of  Scotland  behind them The General seeing no Way to  escape without making his Way thro' them resolved to fight in that desperate Condition and after one Hour's warm Dispute the  Scots  were defeated and the  English  obtained an en∣tire Victory whereby the Scene was so much changed that the  English  were forced to break the Pikes and Muskets they took not having Conveniency of sending them for  England  It seems the  Scots  pursued the  English  to  Dunbar  and pressed so hard upon them thinking they had them in a Net that the  English  could not retire without fighting by which they got so compleat a Victory that General  Cromwell  was Master that very Day both of  Leith  and  Edinburgh  The News of this Defeat being brought to the King he was pleased to say he thanked God he was so rid of the  Scots  that their Kirk might then see their Error in prohibiting their King from being in Person with their Army and keeping out the  English  and the rest of the King's Followers who in all Probability had prevented their great Misfortune However their King was crowned soon after at  Scone  tho' the  Scotch  Ministers preached that their Defeat was occasioned by their too much Com∣pliance with their King to whom most of the  Scotch  Lords adhered But some Commanders with the Kirk were of a contrary Opinion and would by all means purge the King's Houshold However the  Scots  raise a new Army whom the King in Person would command the Duke of  Hamilton  is made Lieutenant General  David  Lesley  Major General  Middleton  Lieutenant General of the Horse and  Massy  Major Gene∣ral of the  English  and with this Army the King hoped to get bye the  English  and to make the Seat of the War in  England  But after a long and terrible March wherein were several Engagements with different Success the  Eng∣lish  being in the Rear and on all Sides of the  Scots  so that most of the Engagements were to the King's Disadvantage who at last arrived at  Worcester  with his shattered Army where he was beaten by General  Cromwell  the Third Day of  September  as he had done the Year be∣fore at  Dunbar  After this total Defeat the King escaped and was miraculously preserved for a better Fortune and to see the Murderers of his late Royal Father at least some of the principal of them most justly and deservedly punished  After the Success of this Battle General  Cromwell  went to  London  and was highly ca∣ressed by all and having then a Vacation from military Labours he had Time to juggle with his Officers to advance his Power for tho' he then governed as King and the Juncto of Parliament acted only according to his Dictates yet he seemed not so great as he desired whilst he only acted as Master under the Title of a Servant and finding the Juncto did not proceed in all things according to his Mind he resol∣ved to take the Power wholly into his own Hands that it might clearly appear what he was in effect And to this Purpose he got the  Consent of most of the Officers of the Army who were his Creatures to be willing he should break the Juncto of Parliament But before he would execute any Part of this which with∣in himself he had long before designed and now being ripe for Execution he held a long Conference with an eminent Person upon whose Opinion and Judgment he much relied and declared to him his Dissatisfaction with the Parliament's Proceedings and that he would do nothing therein without his Advice who was at this time a Member of Parliament and in great Esteem among them This Gentle∣man with whom  Cromwell  then conferred told him freely that since he governed all at pre∣sent and that the Juncto of Parliament did nothing without his Consent he thought it best that he should continue General as he was ha∣ving the whole Government in his Hands un∣less he would take upon him the Title of King and then he might govern safely and those that served under him would be in no Danger he being King  de facto  according to an Act of Parliament made in the Eleventh of  Henry  VII which was still in Force But  Cromwell  abso∣lutely refused this because he knew he could never get the Officers of the Army their Con∣sent to it nor some of his own near Relations who swore they would kill him if ever he took that Title upon him This Conference puts me in Mind of what Mr  Hambden  said to the Lord  Digby  in the Beginning of the War as they were going down the Parliament Stairs  Cromwell  going just before them the Lord  Digby  who was then a great Man in the House of Commons asked  Hambden  who that Man was  for I see  saith the Lord  Digby he is of our Side by his speaking so warmly this Day  Upon which Mr  Hambden  replied  That sloven∣ly Fellow which you see before us who hath no Ornament in his Speech I say that Sloven if we should ever come to have a Breach with the King which God forbid I say that Slo∣ven in such Case will be one of the greatest Men of  England which was a prophetical Speech But  Hambden  knew him well and was intimately acquainted with him  Now after this Conference between  Cromwell  and that other Person a Member of Parlia∣ment finding  Cromwell  's Averseness to what he proposed he told him there was but one other Way that he knew whereby  Cromwell  might make himself and Family as great as he pleased but that he would not propose it without first having an Assurance from his Excellency that he would not take it ill what he should say nor mention it to any other both which  Crom∣well  promised him upon his Faith and Honour And when the Gentleman disclosed himself farther to  Cromwell  advertizing him what he might do to his own eternal Honour and to what Advantage he pleased for all his Family his Excellency told the Gentleman that it was a Matter of the greatest Importance and would require a good Time to consider of it But his Excellency never spoke one Word more to that  Gentleman about it and finding by that Gentle∣man's Discourse that he was not like to approve of what he intended his Excellency soon found a Way to have him sent a foreign Ambassador whilst he continued his first Resolution in or∣der to which he first erects a Council of Offi∣cers who expostulate with the Parliament about their Arrears and the Dissolution of the Par∣liament which occasioned a long Debate in the House where it was resolved they would con∣tinue their Power Whereupon General  Crom∣well  in the Month of  April  comes into the House with some of his Generals and a File of Musqueteers and dissolves the Juncto of Parliament and after declares his Reasons for it to give the People Satisfaction  In this he was obeyed tho' with some Mur∣muring and Reluctancy of the Members He then bid his Soldiers take away the Fool's Bau∣ble their Mace The Speaker being unwil∣ling to leave his Chair was pulled out of it by Collonel  Harrison  and  Cromwell  sat down in it and stayed in the House till he saw all the Members out and then he caused the Doors to be locked up to the great Content of the Nation who then judged a worse Slavery could not befal them tho' they expected little Liber∣ty or Freedom from him into whose Hands the Power then fell This Action was certainly a much higher Affront than what the House of Commons took so ill from the late King that one of their own Members should so violently turn them all out  Thus this Juncto of Parliament was at this time treated by those that had set them up and took their Commissions and Authority from them nor could the Army justify any Action they had done or one Drop of Blood they had spilt but by their Authority The Servants rose up against their Masters and dissolved that Power by which they were created Officers and Soldiers and then the Army took what they had long since designed all Power into their own Hands and after the Parliament had sub∣dued all their Enemies they were overthrown and ruined by their own Servants and those whom they had raised pulled down their Ma∣sters an Example very strange by which we see how uncertain all worldly Affairs are and how apt to fall when they think them at the highest Point And soon after this Dissolution the General gave his Reasons in Print to satisfy the Nation why he had dissolved them in a long Declaration  By this Dissolution  Cromwell  was possessed of the Three Kingdoms having both the legisla∣tive and military Power in his Hands and therefore he thought fit to chuse several Per∣sons to be the supreme Government who met at  Westminster  and called themselves a Par∣liament and chose one Mr  Rouse  for their Speaker who had the usual Ceremonies belon∣ging to that Office and this was by Nickname called  Barebone  's Parliament because he was a Member of it being at that time a LeatherSeller in  Fleetstreet  But this Parliament not  agreeing amongst themselves tho' they were but an Hundred and Forty after some short Time they resign their Power to  Cromwell  who gave it them Then  Cromwell  is declared by his Council or by the Instrument of Govern∣ment as they called it Protector of the Com∣monwealth of  England Scotland  and  Ireland  and proclaimed so in the usual Places as the Kings formerly were and in this extraordina∣ry Manner he mounted the Throne of the Three Kingdoms without the Name of a King but with greater Power and Authority than any King and received greater Esteem and Respect from all the Princes of Christendom than ever had been shewed to any Monarch of the Three Nations For tho' they all abhorred him yet they trembled at his Power and courted his Friendship After he had sufficiently beaten the  Dutch  he made a Peace with them and obliged  Portugal  to send an Ambassador to make Peace and prosecuted all those of the King's Party that were at home with the utmost Ri∣gour and Cruelty and erected a High Court of Justice for Tryal of such as should rise or plot any thing against him and many were executed upon that Account He made his youngest Son  Henry  Lord Lieutenant of  Ire∣land  But  England  proved not so as he ex∣pected for the most considerable Men that were in the House of Commons from the time that he dissolved them poisoned the Affections of the People towards the Government and yet carried themselves so warily that they did  not disturb the Peace of the Nation And tho'  Cromwell  was then possessed of the sove∣reign Power yet he thought himself not secure till he had the Consent of the People in Parlia∣ment and therefore according to his Power in the Instrument of Government he summo∣ned a Parliament which met at  Westminster  the Third Day of  September  the famous Day of his two great Victories at  Dunbar  and  Wor∣cester  and in this Parliament  Lenthall  was cho∣sen Speaker This he thought was the only Way to have the People entirely submit to him and he ordered it so that no Person who had ever been against the Parliament during the time of the Civil War or the Sons of any such Person should be chosen  Cromwell  came into the House and allowed the Speaker The first Speech that was made amongst them was to know by what Authority they came thither And whether he that had convened them had a lawful Power to do it And tho' the Pro∣tector's Creatures endeavoured to direct them yet many of the Members declared against the Power And one more bold than others said  That as God had made him instrumental of cut∣ting down Tyranny in one Man so now he could not endure to see the Nation's Liberties shackled by another who had no Right to the Govern∣ment but by the Length of his Sword  The Continuance of this warm Debate lasted for some Days which much perplexed the Prote∣ctor who sent for the Parliament to him in the  BanquetingHouse  and told them in his canting  Tone that he was sorry to hear they were fal∣ling into Heats and Divisions and declared that the same Government that made him Pro∣tector had made them a Parliament and that therefore no Man was to sit in that House that did not first take an Engagement which he had caused to be made which many refused to take as being against their Privileges and a Guard was set at the Door of the House that none should enter that had not taken it and not∣withstanding many refused entering upon that Account yet the Residue proved so resty that he was obliged to dissolve them which he did and said he could do his Business without them It was about this time that  Wildman  and  Lil∣burn  the two great Levellers were taken and prosecuted but  Lilburn  more severely than the other and tho' he was accused and tryed for HighTreason yet the Jury found him Not Guilty He told the People at his Tryal  That all  Englishmen  were obliged to oppose  Cromwell  's Tyranny as he had done purely for their sakes to preserve them from being Slaves  And tho' he was acquitted yet  Cromwell  never suffered him to be set at Liberty but still kept him inclosed from Prison to Prison till he him∣self died  After the Dissolution of the Parliament  Cromwell  not thinking himself secure in the Government he invented a new Chimera to keep the People in Awe which was the Go∣vernment by the Major Generals and the whole Kingdom was divided amongst them being  Eleven in all These were principally employed to decimate Delinquents Estates and gave them great Power to value what the Tenth Part of every such Estate did amount to and every Man was to pay what they thought fit and upon Neglect the Person to be imprisoned and his whole Estate sequestered But finding these Major Generals were very odious to all Parties and fearing they might in the End undermine his own Greatness and govern like  Turkish  Bassaws he soon put an End to their Power believing they eclipsed his Glory  Then the  Jews  offered  Cromwell  a great Sum of Money that they might be permitted to traffick freely but the City and principal Merchants therein being much against it that Project failed him After in the Year  Cromwell  who was then called Protector of the Commonwealth of  England Scotland  and  Ire∣land  c summoned another Parliament who met accordingly and remembring the Speeches and Carriages of many Members of the late Parliament he gave secret Advice to the Sheriffs of the several Counties to hinder if possible their being chosen but this Advice proved fruitless in most Places However the Parliament met and before they were permit∣ted to enter the House they were to subscribe a Recognition that they would act nothing that was prejudicial to the Government as established by a Protector Whereupon many Members chose rather to return home but the Major Part signed the Recognition entered the  House and chose Sir  Thomas Withrington  Spea∣ker who acted suitably to the Protector's De∣sires in every thing The Parliament pressed  Cromwell  mightily to be King which  Cromwell  positively refused but his Refusal seemed not in the least disadvantageous for that by a new Instrument which was called the Humble Peti∣tion and Advice they granted him not only the Authority of Protector for his Life but also a Power to declare his Successor and when they had agreed upon this they desired an Audience which he gave them in the  BanquetingHouse  the Twenty Fifth of  May  where their Speaker  Withrington  presented and read the Petition and Advice of his Parliament and desired his Assent to it which the Protector then signed and made a long Harangue to them and was solemnly in∣augurated in  WestminsterHall  and adjourned the Parliament till  January  following  And thus the Parliament having done all that could be expected from them he would do something for himself whose Greatness in that Vacancy was so well established both at Home and Abroad that it seemed as if it could never be shaken He was confirmed in his Power with the Title of Protector and took his Oath accordingly and was proclaimed Protector in the usual Places as the Kings for∣merly were and solemnly inaugurated in  West∣minsterHall  In  January  the Parliament met but new Institutions in Government are often unsecure for a Gap was left open which none of the  Contrivers of the new Government thought of there being one Article in  The Humble Pe∣tition and Advice  to which  Cromwell  had assen∣ted and sworn  That no Member lawfully chosen should be excluded but by the Consent of that House of which he was a Member  and pro∣ceeding to the calling over their House all those who had been before refused Entrance for not signing the Recognition were admitted where∣by above One Hundred of the most inveterate Enemies of the Protector came and sat in the House But  Cromwell  thought he had sufficient∣ly provided for his Security to restrain the Insolency of the House of Commons by having called the other House which by the Petition and Advice was to be done and filled it for the most Part with Officers of the Army and of his surest Friends and that were firmly fixed to the Protector's Interest  When the Adjournment ended and the Houses met  Cromwell  came to the Upper House and sent the Black Rod for the House of Commons to attend him and being in his Chair of State he began his Speech in the old Style  My Lords and you the Knights Citizens and Burgesses of the House of Commons  So soon as the Com∣mons returned to their House they began to question the Authority and Jurisdiction of the other House That tho' the Petition and Advice admitted there should be another House but that it should be a House of Peers and they be called My Lords there was no such Provision nor did it appear what Jurisdiction they should  have and that it would be ridiculous for them who sat only by their Vote no better Men than themselves to have a negative Voice to controul their Masters and they esteemed it as a thing made on Purpose to mock them And then they began to question the Protector's Au∣thority how his Highness came to place them in the House of Peers at which the Commons were much disgusted Of which the Protector being advertized he was strangely surprized and found he had been shortsighted in not having proceeded at the same time to fill up his House of Commons when he erected his other of Peers However he forthwith con∣vened both Houses and reprehended the House of Commons for presuming to question his Au∣thority The other House he said were Lords and should be Lords and commanded them to enter upon such Business as might be for the Benefit not Destruction of the Commonwealth which he would by God's Help prevent But finding his Animadversions did not reform them but that they continued their former Presum∣ption and knowing the Ticklishness of his Time would not endure Disputes especially as to his Pageant Lords whom he had newly erected He therefore sent the Black Rod for the House of Commons the Fourth of  February  and after having used many sharp Expressions of Indig∣nation he told them it concerned his Interest as much as the Peace of the Nation to dissolve them and accordingly he did dissolve them And to shew how little he feared those Men  who contradicted him at home he sent imme∣diately for  Lambert  and took away his Com∣mission and removed him from the Army who forthwith retired and was as little taken notice of as if he had never been in Authority which gave great Reputation to the Protector and shewed he was Master of his Army  Whilst these warm Debates were in Agita∣tion at home about the Protector's Govern∣ment he was so cunning as to make Treaties and Leagues abroad and was publickly owned by many Kingdoms and States and it was about this time that the  English  with Conjun∣ction of the  French  took  Dunkirk  and  Graveling  the first of which was by by Agreement garri∣soned by the  English  and Sir  William Lockhart  a  Scotchman  made Governour and  Graveling  was garrisoned by the  French  But during these Successes abroad the King was first at  Cologne  where he was well received and treated before which his Family was in great Disorder at  Paris  but being at  Cologne  it was put under the Care and Management of Sir  Stephen Fox  who had the Disposal of all and he there kept the King's House and Family for about Six Hundred Pistoles a Month but his Majesty never kept a Coach all the time he was at  Cologne  From thence his Majesty went to  Bruges  in  Flanders  where he stayed in the Year and after he had been there some time Six Thousand Guilders was settled month∣ly for himself and Family and Half that Sum I mean Half as much more for Support of  the Dukes of  York  and  Gloucester  He was then to raise Four Regiments of Foot the first Regiment for his own Guards commanded by the Lord  Wentworth  but they were to do their Duty in the Army as common Men till his Majesty was in Condition to bring them about his Person The Earl of  Ormond  had the se∣cond Regiment the Earl of  Rochester  the third and the fourth was given to the Earl of  New∣burgh  a  Scotch  Nobleman who had served the King with great Fidelity And these four Re∣giments were soon raised Whilst the King was at  Bruges Cromwell  exercised all imaginary Tyranny in his Government The King's Heart was almost broken with the daily Informations he received of the Ruine and Destruction his loyal Party underwent and the Butchery acted upon them and the extreme Tyranny  Cromwell  exercised over the whole Nation was then very grievous to his Majesty seeing no End of it  Scotland  was then governed by a Rod of Iron subdued by those whom they had first taught to rebel and with whom they had joined to destroy their own natural Prince and dissol∣ved that Monarchy which had been ever since they were a Nation and those who had used to practise such ill Behaviour towards their King were then contemned and made Slaves to the meanest of the People who prescribed them new Laws to which they had never been accu∣stomed The King then saw those who were the Beginners and first Authors of our publick  Calamities so much Sharers therein that they were no more Masters of their own Estates than they were whom they had first spoiled and that no Part of the new Government was in their Hands who had pulled down the old and that after Monarchy had seemed so odious to them their whole Nation was at the Disposal of a single Person and that those  Scotch  Lords without whose traitorous Assistance the Scepter could never have been wrested out of the Hands of their King were now reckoned amongst the Dreggs of the People and so numbred This could not but give some Satisfaction to King  Charles  II to see God's Judgments fallen upon them who were the principal Cause of our Rebellion in  England  But before I go farther I will beg Leave here to give you  Cromwell  's Character both before and after he came to be Protector At the first Beginning of the Long Parliament when he heard any Man speak of the Troubles of the Nation he would weep most bitterly and appear the most afflicted Person in the World with the Sense of the Calamities that were likely to arrive But the wiser sort of Men in the House of Commons soon discovered his wicked Intentions and his great Hypocrisy was no longer concealed from them Nothing more perplexed him than the Death of his dear Daughter  Claypole  who was troubled at nothing so much before her Death as at the Blood her Father had spilt and it was believed she had represented his worst Actions to him  and yet he never made the least Shew of any Remorse or Repentance for any of his Actions He could never have done half that Mischief he did without having great Parts of Industry Courage and Judgment He must have had a wonderful Insight into the Affections and Hu∣mours of Men who from a private Birth with∣out any Interest Estate or Alliance could raise himself to so great a Height He attempted that which no good Man durst undertake and performed that which none but a wicked vali∣ant Man could succeed in There was certain∣ly never a more wicked Man nor one that ever brought to pass what he designed more wicked∣ly He consulted very few and when he had once taken a Resolution he would not be dis∣swaded from it He was never unfortunate in any of his Undertakings abroad but only in that of  Pen  and  Venables  who were sent out by him with a Fleet and Land Army in and had ill Success In fine to reduce Three Nations who perfectly hated him into an in∣tire Obedience and to govern them with a Rod of Iron by an Army that wished his utter Ru∣ine was an Instance of a prodigious Address and shewed that he was born for the Ruine of our  English  Nation  But yet after all his Greatness both at home and abroad some things happened before his End which much disturbed him not only the frequent Plots against his Person but the Co∣ming up of a monstrous Whale in the fresh Wa∣ter contrary to the Nature of that Fish as  far as  Greenwich  where it was taken and be∣lieved by many to portend some great Alteration in the Commonwealth Yet this did not so much trouble the Protector as the Death of his dear Daughter  Claypole  who died in the Beginning of  August  He had settled his greatest Affection upon this Daughter from the time of whose Death he appeared very melancholy and fell sick about the Middle of  August  but his Sickness being only an Ague there was no Ap∣prehensions of his Death and he declared pub∣lickly to his Physicians and many others  That God would not take him away till he done some more Work for him  But it soon appeared that if God did not the Devil did take him for he died the Third of  September  following A Day that had been so fortunate to him proved his last in this World and such a Tempest ac∣companied his Death that Night as was not seen in the Memory of Man Great Trees in  St James  's Park were blown up by the Roots of which I was an Eye Witness The large strong Pales which made up the Breach on  London  Bridge caused by a violent Fire some Years before were blown down many Boats cast away upon the  Thames  great Shipwrecks at Sea besides several by the Storm in divers Parts of  England  by Land The Prince of the Air shewed his Power was above the Pro∣tector's who thought not fit that he should part quietly out of this World who had made such a Combustion Trouble and Misery in it He was a Person indeed who by his Arts of Dis∣sembling  Wickedness and Murder attained to the Height of Greatness He made foreign Nations know more of  England  's Strength than any of our Kings of late Years had done Besides he had all Parts of Policy so necessary for an Usurper and had so perfectly learnt the Art of Dissembling that with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven whose Heart was far from it and his Hand laid on his Breast he would pray cry and act the Saint till he had fully accom∣plished his Designs  After  Cromwell  's Death his Son  Richard  be∣ing named in the Petition and Advice succeeded as Protector but having nothing of his late Father's Spirit or Parts was unfit to hold what his late Father had got and so was quickly turned out and deposed by his ambitious and jealous Kindred without drawing his Sword for it Then at the Army's Call that filthy Part of the Commons called the Juncto retur∣ned back to govern who not pleasing their overpowerful Masters the Army they were a second time expulsed by the Army Then a Creature of the Army's begetting with a new Name of their own devising called  The Com∣mittee of Safety  was substituted which occa∣sioned a great Difference betwixt the  English  and  Scotch  Army the latter declaring a great Dissatisfaction against the Proceedings of the former and the Contest ended by the Divisi∣ons in the  English  Army their Mutinery and Mouldring away whilst the  Scotch  Army un∣der the Command of the prudent  Fabius  Gene∣ral  Monk  advanced towards  London  whose Coming and Design had been prevented if timorous  Fleetwood  had made good his Promise of sending first to the King the Great Seal with the Keeper of it to assure his Majesty of their Repentance and Resolution to call in the King which was agreed betwixt  Fleetwood  and the Keeper who was ready to go with the Great Seal But some Officers then in Being in the Army opposed  Fleetwood  's Resolution who had before promised them to do nothing without their Consent of that Nature and so the whole Business was set aside when the Keeper was ready to go with the Great Seal  It was the King's great Happiness that  Monk  never owned his Design of serving the King till it fell in his Power If he had declared his Resolution sooner he had destroyed himself and the Assurance that the Parliament had that  Monk  had no such Intention hindered those Obstructions which probably would have ruined his Credit with his own Army and united the rest of the Forces against him It is true that he was the Instrument to bring that to pass which certainly he had neither Wisdom to fore∣see nor Understanding to contrive he being a phlegmatick dull Person till he was awakened by his Officers who thought him in great Dan∣ger by pulling down the Gates of the City of  London  And therefore his Officers perswaded him to march again into the City and then he declared to the Citizens at Alderman  Wate  's House whom I knew very well and at which  time I lodged at Mr  Clargy  's House an Apo∣thecary near  CharingCross  whose Sister was married to  Monk  This Apothecary was a very active stirring Man and full of Intrigues and I believe he prevailed much with his Brother  Monk  to induce him to do what he did For whilst he was at Alderman  Wate  's he then assured the Citizens that he would live and die with them which gave them great Joy and put the Parliament in some Disorder where∣upon they sent some Members to treat with him upon which he returned to  Whitehall  and then sent for the Members of both Parties for those that were turned out of Parliament in the Year and delivers a Paper to them in Writing which his Secretary read to them and then they all thought that he really in∣tended the Establishing a Commonwealth But no sooner was the Conference ended but the Members that had been excluded from entered the House of Commons and presently dissolved themselves which really contributed as much to his Majesty's Service as if really  Monk  had designed it at the first But whether he did or did not I think is yet a great Que∣stion the wisest amongst us believing he never at first intended it but that it fell into his Lap to make our Nation happy by restoring the right Heir to the Crown without the Assi∣stance of any foreign Prince which was a Hap∣piness beyond our Expectation or Desert  But before the almost miraculous Restoration of King  Charles  II and his coming to the Go∣vernment  I think something may be said tho' not in Vindication yet in Mitigation of the Crimes committed by some Members in that Long Parliament in which unhappy Times the Crown was even laid in the Dust and the Justice of the King's Cause did not prevail against those malignant Spirits who had de∣signed the King's Ruine and had misled and corrupted the Understandings of many of his Majesty's Subjects who were overperswaded by the specious Shew of  Salus Populi suprema Lex  and thro' Mistakes and Inconveniences then introduced tho' not intended by the late King did in those calamitous Times rather weakly than wilfully transgress their Bounds of Duty and did not pay the Reverence and Obedience to the fundamental Laws of the Land which they should have done but were led by the wicked Insinuation of others being confident that many from their Hearts ab∣horred every Article of that strange and un∣heard of Rebellion and most heartily depreca∣ted the Miseries that followed it and yet they themselves contributed to it and to those very Votes from whence those Evils they abhorred did naturally spring not considering that when their Consultations tended to lessen or infringe the Power and Dignity of their King they meddled with that which was not in their Determination and which the King ought to have maintained with the Sacrifice of his Life And we may well believe those Miseries could never have been brought upon the  English  Na∣tion  nor that Violence committed upon the sa∣cred Person of his then Majesty if those pro∣fligated Villains that designed it had not first violated the Parliament by forcibly excluding those Members who would never have consen∣ted to so execrable an Attempt since they had avowed and covenanted for Defence and Safety of the King's Person which was ever before dear to Parliaments And none can think of that horrid Act committed against the precious Life of our Sovereign but with Detestation and such Abhorrence that Words are wanting to express it And had I the Voice of  Stentor  nay of St  Paul  I could not sufficiently de∣claim against it and next to wishing it had never been we wish it may never be remem∣bered but with that Grief and Trouble of Mind it deserves being the greatest Reproach to our  English  Nation that it ever yet incurred tho' the Nation it self as well as several Mem∣bers of Parliament were innocent of it which was the only Contrivance and Act of some ambitious bloodthirsty Persons hoping the di∣vine Justice will not impute the Evil of it to the whole Kingdom and involve the Guiltless with the Guilty  The END of the  MEMOIRS  of the  REIGN  of K  CHARLES I  MEMOIRS AND REFLECTIONS UPON THE Reign and Government OF K  CHARLES  the II  d  Written by Sir  RICHARD BULSTRODE  Agent and Resident at the Court of  Spain  from King  Charles II  and after his Death Envoy from King  James II  till the Coming in of the Prince of  Orange  LONDON  Printed in the Year MDCCXX  MEMOIRS OF THE REIGN and GOVERNMENT OF K  CHARLES  the II  d  A  FTER the deplorable Death of King  Charles  I fitter to be writ∣ten in Tears of Blood than Ink or rather to have a Veil drawn over it that it may never be re∣membered to the eternal Shame of the  English  Nation his Son King  Charles  II was crowned King in  Scotland  but it was up∣on such hard Terms that it was a Question  whether the Crown was worth accepting How∣ever as the King's Affairs then stood it was judged best to accept of it preferring the em∣pty Title of a King in his own Dominions to the empty Title of a King in another Nation And yet it was thought strange that the King would put himself into the Hands of that Na∣tion whose Army had treated his royal Father so perfidiously the Selling and Delivering him to the Parliament of  England  being the most barbarous Action that any People were ever guilty of and their Honour can never be re∣paired for the Horridness of that most wicked Crime However the late King  Charles  could not be much blamed in the sad Posture of his Affairs for going to that Army to which he was so kindly invited having been ever a great Lover of that Nation not only having been born there but educated by them and there∣fore thought he should find there his greatest Security where he found the most Danger But indeed such strange Circumstances contri∣buted to his Ruine that we might think Hea∣ven and Earth had conspired against him who was from the Beginning so much betrayed by his own Servants that very few remained faith∣ful to him and yet their Treachery proceeded rather from some particular Animosities amongst themselves than from any treasonable Intent to do the King Harm And notwithstanding he was reduced to so miserable a Fate yet it is most certain he had as great a Share in the Hearts and Affections of his Subjects in gene∣ral  and was as much beloved and esteemed by them as any of his Predecessors But it was our Wantonness under the Happiness we en∣joyed beyond any other Nation and our own Sins which brought that Judgment upon us The strange Transactions in  England  which began in the Year are not to be paral∣lelled for the wonderful Passages therein we then saw  England  in the highest Pitch of worldly Happiness fall to the lowest Degree of Misfortune and Misery  I know very well how unsearchable the Se∣crets of Princes are in what an Abyss they lye and how much too deep to be sounded by our Discourses but when I remember the Turns of those Times I seem rather to dream than to think the Relation true of so many surpri∣zing Revolutions which are scarce credible in this our Age The best of Kings was then condemned by merciless Rebels after being abandoned by his nearest Friends and pursued by his fiercest Enemies who furiously seized upon his sacred Person and at last took away his Life and triumphed in their own Wicked∣ness with successful Insolence for some Years when at last by God's Providence the right∣ful Heir to the Crown was brought home to his own People without the Assistance of any foreign Prince in as full Exercise of his Go∣vernment as any of his Predecessors ever en∣joyed and by many of the same Men who had before been very active in the Miseries of the Kingdom and Destruction of their own  Country and yet the Sufferings of the royal Family were all recovered by the concurring Hand of divine Providence By which we may see when Subjects make Victories over their Princes they are Triumphs over them∣selves and those Men which will force Laws which they are bound to preserve will in the End find all their Victories full of Trou∣bles bringing Ruine to their Authors  But leaving this Digression let us see what is become of our King in  Scotland  who car∣ried many eminent faithful Subjects with him thither who were nothing at all esteemed by the  Scots  who chose a particular Council by whose Advice the King was to govern who gave the  Scots  great Satisfaction in all things they desired of him And upon his being crowned in  Scotland Cromwell  was declared General and prepared for a War and marched with his Army which he had before modelled to his own Mind commanded absolutely dis∣countenancing and suppressing all who had been supported by General  Fairfax  The Indepen∣dants had all the Credit about  Cromwell  and the Pulpits were open to all that would shew their Gifts and great Distraction and Confusion in Religion then governed The  Scots  raised an Army against  Cromwell  supplied with all things necessary but Prudence Courage and Conduct The King desired that he might command the Army since he was to run the Fortune of it but the  Scots  would scarce give him Leave to see it  Cromwell  enters  Scotland  as far as  Dunbar  but was soon reduced to great Distress for want of all Necessaries The  Scots  really believed they had the  English  at their Mercy and it is certain if the  Scots  had only kept their Trenches and sent Parties of Horse after the  English  they would have marched off and left their Cannon and heavy Baggage behind But  Cromwell  seeing the  Scotch  Army decamp and follow him he then made a Stand with his Army and the  Scots  soon found they were not upon so clear a Chase as they imagined being so clearly defeated by  Cromwell  that he was that Night being the Third of  September  Master both of  Leith  and  Edinburgh  The  Scots  like the Anabaptists in  Germany  pretended at first nothing but Faith and true Fear of God and declared against Riches and Honours as Vanity and upon the great Opinion of their Humility and Devotion they had procured much Esteem and after they had ensnared many with their Hypocrisy they would reform both Church and State And having gotten Power and enriched them∣selves with the Spoils of  England  they thought then to justify themselves by our Saviour's Pro∣mise that  The Meek should inherit the Earth  When they first entered  England  their Success crowned their Work and they were thought a wise and resolute Nation for after an unbloody War for above one Year they returned laden with Spoils and great Riches and were liberally rewarded as well for going out as coining in∣to  England  It seems the King in  Scotland  was so far from being in their late Battle at  Dunbar  that he was not admitted into their Councils or Ar∣my But to redeem their former Error they resolved to raise a new Army to be comman∣ded by the King in Person hoping to pass ano∣ther Way bye  Cromwell  into  England  intending to make the Seat of the War there and made the highest Professions of Duty to his Majesty that could be invented and gave great Promi∣ses to the King of what Demonstrations of Zeal and Duty they would suddenly shew him  The King began his March which was long and terrible and several Engagements passed in the Way with different Success but most of them to the King's Disadvantage who in the End arrived at  Worcester  with his shattered Army and was there as clearly defeated by  Cromwell  the Third of  September  as the  Scots  were the Year before at  Dunbar  The King's Escape after the Loss of this Battle was very miraculous being preserved by a wonderful Providence from the Fury of his bloodthirsty Rebels His Majesty first met in a Wood not far from  Boscobell  with Captain  Careless  who perswaded the King to get up into an Oaken Tree From thence he went into a Cottage where he lay in a Barn and was then condu∣cted to another House by Father  Huddleston  who was sent to him by  Careless  who after brought him to the Lord  Wilmot  who con∣ducted the King to Mr  Lane  's House from whence the King rode before young Mrs  Lane  to her Cousin  Norton  near  Bristol  where the King was known to the Butler From thence the Lord  Wilmot  took the King into  Sussex  to Collonel  Gunter  's and from thence brought the King into  Normandy  who had ever after a great Esteem for his Lordship There was in∣deed such a Concurrence of Charity good Na∣ture and Generosity in Persons of the meanest Extraction and hardest Fortune who knew the Delivery of the King would have been of great Advantage to them that we may look upon the King's Escape as conducted by Hands of the Almighty who covered him as with a Shield when his rebellious People sought his Life who was still concealed from their most diligent Search wherein Father  Huddleston  was very instrumental And tho' many knew where the King was and those very poor yet none were tempted by great Rewards and more pow∣erful Fears to betray the King who after ma∣ny Changes of Station and Misfortunes after this miraculous Manner was brought into  France  and at last brought home to his own People And tho' he was forced away by a Whirlwind of Rebellion he was restored to his Three Kingdoms with the still Voice of Peace and Mercy a happy Presage how his Majesty would govern whose Reign at least the Begin∣ning of it shewed sufficiently his meek and ge∣nerous Temper In the time of the King's Ba∣nishment he spent two Years at  Cologne  where he was well received by a Widow at whose House he lodged Before his going to  Cologne  his Family was in great Disorder but at his being there by Direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer his Family was put under the Care and Management of Sir  Stephen Fox  who kept it in excellent Order The King was then of a very merciful Nature and at that time it was very agreeable to his Inclination not to have the Penal Laws put in Execution and tho' it was not in his Power to repeal them yet it was never in his Will to execute them and his Majesty was then very forward to do all he could for the  Roman  Catholicks in that kind But when he came into  England  he soon changed his Mind and proved in the End very severe against the  Roman  Catholicks who desi∣red to live quietly but could not be allowed to do so  Upon this King's most happy Restoration there was seen from all Parts his loyal Subjects contending how to express their Gratitude to Heaven for its glorious Favour and the King's no less than miraculous Return and for the manifold Blessings they were like to enjoy un∣der the benign Reign of so excellent a Prince every Man striving who should first pay the humble Oblation of their Duties which really proceeded from Hearts full of Reverence and Obedience to his sacred Person being possessed with a deep Sense of the Honour and good For∣tune they had to be born his Subjects And indeed who could forbear to be transported with Joy that was going to receive his King And who could contain the Overflowings of his  Heart when he could say  I have my KING again  'Tis true that when the Nation had been so long mad after so many Changes and Revolu∣tions and our Progress from bad to worse we might with Reason have expected God should have sent us the worst of Tyrants some Infi∣del or Usurper to scourge us with Whips as we well deserved But he was so gracious as to send us our own King the undoubted Heir to the Crown to redeem our Nation from the In∣famy it had undergone and to restore it to all it had lost and to make the People as happy as they ought to be In order to which the King gave a general Pardon to all excepting only such as should be excepted by Parliament and that no Person whatsoever for any Crime committed either against his late royal Father or against the present King's sacred Person should ever be brought in Question to the least Damage of Life Liberty or Estate or even to the Prejudice of his Reputation or any other Reproach or Term of Distinction And the King did then also declare a Liberty to tender Consciences and that none should be disquie∣ted or called in Question for Difference of Opinion in Matters of Religion which did not disturb the Peace or Settlement of the Kingdom And further to let his Subjects see how to practise the Art of Forgetfulness which they should learn from him his Majesty did then put some Men into eminent Employs who had before disserved him so that every Man might  capacitate himself by his future Behaviour for any Place But this Conduct seemed to some like a trimming Indifferency to disoblige his old Friends in hopes of getting new ones which hath usually been the Subversion of Go∣vernments and no wise Counsellour would ad∣vise his Prince to grieve his old Friends to make his old Enemies rejoice However as the Posture of the King's Affairs then stood he was obliged to take such Measures but whether at last the King found his End in them is yet a great Question For as the Judgments of God have in all Ages reached those at last who have secretly taken away the Lives of Princes or have been in open Rebel∣lion against their lawful Kings so his Justice did at last in  England  become the Revenger of Blood and pursued those that killed and took Possession after they had boasted of their Wickedness for several Years and brought them at last to condign Punishment to let the World see and know that Rebellion is criminal even when it is prosperous and tho' God may forbear for some time to punish yet he always does it justly at last For tho' God hath leaden Feet and is slow in punishing yet he hath Iron Hands and strikes home in the End And here that some Compensation might be made for the Loss of the Royal Father which was irreparable God gave the Crown to his eldest Son It is most certain that King  Charles  II at his first coming to the Throne had most reconciling Thoughts who gave large Evidence of them  after so high a Distemper and such a universal shaking the Foundations of Government desi∣ring and commanding his Parliament to take Care to repair the Breaches and to use such Circumspection and Industry as might provide things necessary for strengthening those Repairs and to prevent for the future whatever might disturb or weaken the common Interest re∣commending to his Parliament a general Union as the best if not the only Way for their own Security and the Happiness of the whole King∣dom This King indeed at his Restoration was glorious in the Eyes of all his Subjects Those great Deliverances which the divine Goodness had afforded to his royal Person from many imminent Dangers and the Support which it gave to his heroick princely Mind under such various Tryals made it appear that he was precious in God's Sight and as Gold out of the Fire He was restored to his People and Patrimony with more Splendor and Dignity who had made a right Use of his Afflictions and taken such Observations of other Countries that he really intended to make all his Subjects the better for what he had seen and suffered abroad  It is true that in the Beginning of this King's Reign the Doctrine of the Court was  Sow a little that ye may reap much  and those who were then entrusted with the Nation's Purse were themselves for diving into the Prince's Pocket and that too generous Prince at his first coming to the Crown was soon overperswaded  to give away the greatest Part of his Crown Lands The Courtier begged and the Citizen bought and the King was soon di∣vested of all and yet they who suffered for his late royal Father were not the better for all his immoderate Bounties These his great Li∣beralities were not given as the Recompence of ancient Merit but were bestowed either as Re∣wards of Vice or Price of Treachery so that the worst Men made the best Advantage And tho' the King did then what was very prejudi∣cial to the Crown yet such was the flourishing Condition of the  English  at that time that the People could bear a great deal of ill Manage∣ment Besides some were glad to see a young King that would soon be necessitated by his ex∣travagant Bounty to depend upon his People who did then begin to apprehend that the King did meditate an arbitrary Power Now whatever Ground the great Counsellours of those Times had there was no Bar put in the Way of that destructive Bounty but as ill∣gotten Goods seldom prosper very little of what was obtained remained long in the Hands of the first Possessor but all was soon dispersed into a Multitude of Hands and the Silence of those who then had a Right to complain seemed in some measure to have justified such Proceed∣ings And tho' the King being then young airy and liberal was much to blame for per∣mitting such a Spoil to be made of his Revenue yet they whose Duty it was to take Care of the Body Politick suffered the Distemper to  proceed too far and what the King did was then winked at because the Courtiers who were nearest the King's Person got all and and the great Trade and Wealth of the  English  might bear such Gifts which were not then supplied by new and heavy Taxes which the People after found excessive in a following Reign However this great Oversight of the King should teach wise Princes to distinguish betwixt those that serve them for their own Ends and those that have only in their View the Interest and Honour of the King their Ma∣ster But we always see Compliance and Flatte∣ry get the better of Honesty and plain Dealing Princes usually loving those best that dispute not with them and prefer them before such as advise them really what is best for their Service This kind of Flattery is a Plant so preserved in most Courts that it never fails of bringing most dangerous Fruit and Princes very seldom discover it till it be too late and that they are ruined by it I must confess it would be a great Advantage to Princes and to their Sub∣jects a great Happiness to have plain Truths delivered to them with Decency and Privacy from their most faithful Servants whereby they might redress many Mistakes of their Judg∣ments or Will which brings to my Mind what  Tom Killigrew  a Groom of the BedChamber to King  Charles  II said as he was under his Barber's Hands A Book being in the Window in which  Killigrew  was looking it being a Book of his own Plays of which the King taking  Notice he asked him  What Account he would give at the Day of Judgment of all the idle Words in that Book Why truly  says  Killigrew I shall give a better Account of all the idle Words in this Book than your Majesty shall do of all your idle Promises and more idle Patents which have undone many but my idle Words in this Book have undone no Person  This was a bold and sharp Repartee but the King being an in∣dulgent Master and not of a Disposition to do harsh things gave  Killigrew  a great Liberty of Fooling for otherwise he must needs have ta∣ken Notice of that bitter Reflection which the King did not But if the Substance of that Sar∣casm had been told the King decently and pri∣vately it might have had a good Operation whereas what was spoken was then taken for a Jest only and so the King passed it by Now if we seriously reflect on the first Twelve Years of this King's Government we shall not find in the like Space of Time either at home or abroad so great Plenty of all things for the Delight of Mankind nor find so long a Time free from Injustice and Oppression where the King and Lords did less oppress the Commons and where there was so great a Condescension to tender Consciences And if it be true that as  Multa funera sunt opprobria Medicorum  so  Multa supplicia sunt opprobria Principum  it must be much for the Honour and Memory of this King that in his first Twelve Years Go∣vernment there was not one Nobleman put to Death and so few of all others at the Assizes  that the like was never known in the Memory of Man and yet impartial Justice was executed every where I heartily wish I could have said the same to this King's Death for then un∣doubtedly he would have been  CHARLES the Good  tho' not  CHARLES the Great  But alas there now began to be a great Vi∣cissitude of good and bad Events and a very unsettled and various Management of publick Affairs and not with such a Steadiness of Con∣duct as the fresh Experience of our then late Misfortunes might have instructed those with Courage and Constancy that were entrusted with them But those Ministers that then ser∣ved the King at the Helm of his Government were much to blame to suffer such things which were quickly reduced to a most unhappy Con∣dition betwixt the King and his illnatured obstinate Subjects then assembled in Parliament that by his Majesty's condescending to some things which seemed of little or no Conse∣quence when first yielded unto yet they were afterwards made the Foundation of a great Battery against the King's Authority Reputa∣tion and Strength of his Government But it was our own Ingratitude under so many great Advantages we then enjoyed beyond other Peo∣ple which drew those Judgments from Heaven upon us I confess the  Roman  Catholicks who were peaceable and innocent suffered at this time many grievous Persecutions which were not only permitted by the King but his Par∣liament was encouraged therein tho' the King  was not ignorant of their Innocence Yet to Persons that knew those Times and how con∣tinually the King was teazed by those illna∣tured Gentlemen of the House of Commons it will be the less Wonder that such things should happen in the Days of such a Prince who had so yielding a Nature as the King 'Tis true the great Persecutions which the Christians suf∣fered under the good Reign of  Marcus Aurelius Antoninus  the  Roman  Emperor were all impu∣ted to him how justly I cannot say but our King did not only connive but would often rally at the Extravagance of the House of Commons And yet this I may truly say that tho' he gave unlawful Permission to persecute the  Roman  Catholicks whom he knew to be innocent yet he always stood firm to keep the Succession of his Crown in its due and lawful Descent and would never yield to have it alte∣red tho' he was pressed very violently to it by great Artifices which made him often prorogue Parliaments and the King continued resolute in this Point even to his Death  In  June  Mr  Borell  the  Holland  Mini∣ster was with his Majesty and desired the Ad∣mission of four Deputies from the States Gene∣ral to know what the King desired and said as many were appointed for  France  but the King refused their Admission and said he would do nothing without the Participation of his Allies However he would be so generous as to do what he could that lay in his Power and then named the Lord  Hallifax  his Envoy  Extraordinary to the King of  France  and would send him to confer with that King upon their Proposals and it was said he should go thro'  Holland  and take Sir  Gabriel Sylvius  with him  The Sixteenth of  January  following the Duke of  Buckingham  had the same Censure from the House of Commons as the Duke of  Lauder∣dale  had to be both banished from the King's Presence for ever Whereupon the Duke of  Buckingham  desired to be heard in the House of Commons which was granted to him and his Business was to lay all the Blame upon the Earl of  Arlington  who also answered in the House and behaved himself so well that he got immortal Reputation to be a Man of Abi∣lity Prudence Conduct and of great Tem∣per and so escaped the Censure of the House  About this time the  Marquis de Fresno  Am∣bassador Extraordinary from  Spain  presented to the King a very warm Memorial menacing a War unless the King would embrace a Peace with  Holland  upon these Three Points The First was The Flag to Content with Eight Hundred Thousand Pattacoons and the mutual Restitution of Places and Prizes taken in  Eu∣rope  To which his Majesty returned this fol∣lowing Answer  That if they would add a Promise to regu∣late the  East India  Trade give Liberty of De∣parture to the  English  at  Surinam  and not to Fish on the  English  Coast without Permission as to his Majesty he would be content But  that the Place of Treaty must be  Cologne  and Respect paid to the Mediation of  Sweden  which could not be avoided because it was accepted by all But because his Majesty's Answer to the said Memorial may be fully seen I shall here repeat it which was sent to me by the Lord  Arlington  then Secretary of State  His Majesty having seen and considered a Me∣morial delivered to him by his Excellency the  Marquis de Fresno  Ambassador Extraordinary from the Catholick King bearing Date the th of  December  Instant commands this Answer to be made thereunto  THAT he was not a little surprized to find the Contents of this Paper confirmed to him the Report of a Treaty made betwixt the King his Master and the  States General of the United Provinces  the Assisting of whom in this War was a manifest Breach of the separate Article in the Treaty betwixt the two Kings binding them reciprocally not to assist each other's Enemies in any open War And his Majesty's Wonder there∣upon hath been the greater that the Treaty with the  States General  was never owned to him by the Ambassador himself or by any other  Spanish  Minister and that his Excellency was pleased to look upon it when the Rumour there∣of came first abroad as a malicious Invention of the Enemies of the King of  Spain  diffused only to create a Misunderstanding betwixt his Majesty and that Crown Whereas now it seemed  to be a real Thing and does no less according to the Tenor of the said Memorial than threaten a War to his Majesty if he will not submit him∣self to Conditions imposed upon him by his de∣clared Enemies Notwithstanding which his Majesty esteems himself in some Degree beholden to the Catholick Queen for having imparted to him the Terms and Conditions upon which the  States General of the United Provinces  will be content to make a Peace since in so many Months that his Majesty's Plenipotentiaries have been at  Cologne  their Deputies could never be brought to make a clear Declaration of any Offers they would stand to but held them still under such Ambiguities as they might at all times re∣cede from them as they should see Cause  Now altho' the Conditions offered in the said Memorial are very small in respect of the great Expence of Blood and Treasure that War hath cost yet that the World may see how desirous his Majesty is to contribute to the general Peace of Christendom he declares he will be contented with any reasonable Conditions for a Peace suitable to his Honour and the Interest of his Subjects  The Offers made in his Excellency's Name are  First  The Flag to be adjusted to his Majesty's Satisfaction  Secondly  A reciprocal Restitution of Places and Prizes that are or may have been taken during the late War  Thirdly  The Sum of Eight Hundred Thou∣sand Pattacoons  Now if the  States General  will extinguish their Pretences to the Restitution of Prizes as a Thing impracticable and never insisted upon in any Treaty of Peace and to the abovenamed Offers add these additional ones which cannot well be denied  First  An equal and reciprocal Regulation of Trade in the  East Indies  as was promised par∣ticularly in the late Treaty of  Bredah  Secondly  Leave to his Majesty's Subjects yet detained at  Surinam  to depart thence with their Estates and Effects pursuant to the said Treaty and their own reiterated Promises and Orders  Thirdly  That the  States General  shall for the future abstain from Fishing upon the Coasts and Shores of any of his Majesty's Dominions without Leave and Passport first obtained  His Majesty declares that as to himself he will be content with these Conditions But because the Wording of the Articles thereupon is of equal Moment to the Things that shall be contained in them and that this cannot be ef∣fected but by Persons equally intrusted and im∣powered on both Sides his Majesty farther de∣clares That he will direct his Plenipotentiaries at  Cologne  to apply themselves together with the Deputies of the  States General  thereupon  with the Mediators of the Crown of  Sweden  who having been accepted and authorized on both Sides and the City of  Cologne  having been insisted upon by the  Dutch  to the Media∣tors for the Place of Treaty his Majesty con∣ceiveth that neither the Place nor the Media∣tors can be declined without a notorious Offence to the Parties concerned and more particularly to the Honour of the Crown of  Sweden  And his Majesty assureth himself that this his Pro∣ceeding will appear so fair and equal to the Ca∣tholick Queen as not to lessen in any Degree in her royal Breast the Esteem she professes to have for his Friendship and Alliance which his Ma∣jesty hath ever used to his utmost Endeavour to cultivate and improve particularly in making himself the principal Interest of the two Peaces of  Portugal  and  Aix la Chapelle  so valuable to the Crown of  Spain  in the Minority of their King and in continuing the Peace between  France  and  Spain  from any Violation or Distur∣bance by this present War as he did in the Treaty made with the most Christian King when he en∣tered into the Union and Confederation with him against the  States General of the United Provinces  Given at the Court at  Whitehall  the Fif∣teenth of  December    Signed  ARLINGTON  Upon this Memorial many Members of Parliament had the States Generals Reply to his Majesty's Answer to the Memorial sent inclosed to them in Print before the King had received the Original Sir  William Coventry  had four Copies sent him in several Pacquets which he forthwith carried to the Lord Keeper and his Lordship to the King by which may be seen what incongruous things the States Ge∣neral suffered who endeavoured to dethrone his Majesty by their Appeal to his People without taking Notice of the King The Ori∣ginal of this Reply of the States General was sent to his Excellency the  Marquis de Fresno  who thought it too scandalous for him to offer and sent it back to the States with great In∣dignation But towards the End of  January  his Excellency presented a Letter from the States General to the King wherein they granted Five of the Six Points in a full Manner but they refused any Acknowledgment for the Fishing The Ninth of  February  following the Peace betwixt  England  and  Holland  was Signed and Sealed by the  Spanish  Ambassador as Plenipo∣tentiary for  Holland  and by six PrivyCoun∣sellours on the  English  Side  viz  The Lord Keeper the Lord High Treasurer Duke of  Monmouth  Duke of  Ormond  with the two principal Secretaries of State The Scope of the Peace was as follows  The Treaty of  Bredah  remains firm the Ma∣rine Treaty confirmed for Nine Months and that Commissioners should presently meet to  regulate the  East India  Trade in which Regu∣lation  Spain  to be left the Umpire as it is the Guaranty of the whole Treaty  NewYork  to be restored the  English  to come from  Surinam  Eight Hundred Thousand Pattacoons to be paid in the Time specified the  Dutch  Ships to strike in the  British  Seas from Cape  Fenestre  to the  Naze  in  Norway  An Article for hindering each from succouring the Enemies of the other but no mention is made of the Fishing that remaining in the same Condition it formerly was  France  seemed much displeased at this Peace but it was believed his Majesty of  Eng∣land  would interpose as Mediator which was not what most  Englishmen  desired who would gladly see  France  reduced to the Treaty  Pyrrhe∣nean  The Peace betwixt  England  and  Holland  being thus settled the  Spanish  Ambassador took Leave of his Majesty and embarked on the  Assistance  Frigat commanded by Sir  Richard Munden  and  Don Emanuel de Lyra  was named Envoy in the Ambassador's Place and I think it a Right owing to my Lord  Arlington  to in∣sert here a true Translation of the Letter which the  Spanish  Ambassador wrote from  St Andrè  in in  Spain  bearing Date the th of  August  which was sent me by the Lord  Arlington  Most Excellent Sir  GRatitude will not permit me to lose any Occasion of manifesting the same which I now do by the Return of Sir  Richard Munden  for the Honours done me by his Majesty of  Great  Britain  have been so singular and have raised me so much Esteem and Glory that my Obliga∣tion is not to be expressed so that I must beseech your Excellency to lay my Duty at his Majesty's Feet and to acquaint him of my Arrival in  Spain  which hath been with so prosperous and remarkable a Voyage that on the fifth Day in the Morning we discovered the Coast of  Biscay  and had I intended to go to the  Groyn  we had been there that Day In this Dispatch I must attribute much to the great Care and Dexterity of our Captain and to his very courteous Usage of me the better supporting all the Trouble which the Inconveniences of the Sea would give a sick Man And for all this I pay to his Majesty unto whose Grandeur it is due infinite Thanks and shall still publish to the World my Sense and Acknowledgments of All and for the Friendship and Favour which I owe to your Excellency I shall always correspond with the sincerest Truth and Passion I am able God preserve your Ex∣cellency  From  St Andrè  August    But before I go farther I will give an Ac∣count how I came to these honourable Employ∣ments on this Side the Sea  Be pleased then to know that at the Lord  Wentworth  's Death which happened a little before the Burning of  London  I was by the King's Command signified to me by the Lord  Arlington  Principal Secretary of State ap∣pointed to take Care of his Funeral and the Manner of it was then prescribed me His  Lordship was a PrivyCounsellour Collonel of the First Regiment of Foot Guards and was before Major General of all the Horse in  Eng∣land  and General of the Horse in the West of  England  and at his Death was Gentleman of his Majesty's Bedchamber When I had car∣ried his Body in State as the King commanded to  Teddington  in  Bedfordshire  to be buried with his Ancestors and that I returned to  London  the Bills of the Charges of the Funeral were brought to me which I gave the Lord  Arling∣ton  but Money being then very rare and the King no very good Paymaster the Merchants expected their Money from me and the Lord  Wentworth  having received some Money from me which was due to some Companies of the Regiment the Captains thereof complaining that their Companies were not paid the Matter was left to be adjusted by the Duke of  Albe∣marle  who was General The Merchants be∣ing very importunate for their Money I thought best to retire and came to  Bruges  in  Flanders  where many  English  Officers coming daily I was soon discovered and taken Prisoner and at first was used very hardly by the Jayler who had Orders to keep me in his own Apartments to eat and drink with him and that I should have Ten Shillings  English  daily allowed me for Diet Lodging and all Necessaries which should be paid before I was released and Sir  Mark d'Ogniati  who was of  Bruges  and at that time Resident for the King of  Spain  at  London  engaged to see all punctually paid  When my Circumstances were better known I was used very well and it being then that the King of  France  began his Pretensions upon  Flanders  in Right of the  Dauphin  and many  Spanish  Officers being then in  Bruges  I had every Day much Company and knew all that passed in the Army of which I gave an Ac∣count each Post to the Earl of  Arlington  who being then Principal Secretary of State shewed my Letters to the King who being pleased with them asked the Lord  Arlington  who sent those Letters who thereupon told his Majesty that he had them from me who was then a Prisoner in  Bruges  Whereupon the King presently an∣swered that he had seen no Letters that plea∣sed him so much and that gave so clear Ac∣counts and that if I could give such Accounts in Prison I should give much better when out And therefore the King bid his Lordship take Care that I should be forthwith released and sent over to him tho' his Majesty knew I was at that time reconciled and made a  Roman  Catholick by Father  John Cross  who was Pre∣sident at  Douay  and at that time Confessor to the  English  Nuns in the Prince's Hoffe at  Bru∣ges  Upon this Intimation from the King Sir  Mark d'Ogniati  was desired by the Lord  Arlington  to write to  Bruges  what the Account came to for my Imprisonment and all Necessa∣ries and that all should be suddenly paid up∣on which the Jayler came to tell me the good News But I told him I was very well where I was and being out of Danger that I had a  very good Allowance and could no where live so well and that I would not stir from Prison unless after paying all the Charges I might have Money to put me in Equipage and then I would willingly and faithfully serve the King That from my Scituation in Prison I could see the Vanity and Hurry of the World where mi∣serable Men were daily distracting themselves in wearisom contentious Wars about the Great∣ness of an empty World and I could look safely upon them never intermeddling with the Actions of others but spend my Thoughts in my own little Sphere and lay down my Head in Peace and sleep securely in the Bosom of Providence Within few Days after I had given this Account Money was sent to pay all the Charges of the Prison with One Hundred Pounds  Sterling  to put me in good Equipage the Return of Money being then very high and much to my Advantage I received what Was ordered and was forthwith released from Prison  So soon as I was at Liberty I went to the Earl of  Castlehaven  and knowing he had a great Influence upon  Don Pedro de Ronquillos  who was SuperIntedant at  Brussels  I desired he would speak to  Don Pedro  in my Behalf that I might be Auditor to the  Scotch  Regiment of Foot which Place was then vacant and the Regiment was National commanded by Collo∣nel  Scot  of  Tekelah  Kinsman to the Duke of  Monmouth  Hereupon his Lordship recommen∣ded me to  Don Pedro  who was pleased to  examine me and finding me fit for the Employ∣ment gave me his Certificate to the Constable of  Castile  who was then Governour of the  Spa∣nish Netherlands  in Place of  Marquis Castle Roderigo  But the Plague being then at  Brussels  the Constable stayed at  Malines  and upon pretending much Indisposition of Health de∣sired he might return into  Spain  However he sent the  Marquis de Velasco  to compliment our King upon his coming to the Government who sent Sir  EdwardSpraig  to return his Compli∣ment and the Queen sent Mr  Roper  on her Part So soon as the Plague ceased at  Brussels  the Constable returned thither where I found a Way to speak to him and gave him  Don Pedro  's Certificate with a  Placet  from my self and had his Excellency's Promise of Dispatch which he performed the next Day to the great Admiration of all the  Commis  in the Secretary's Office that I being a Stranger could get my Business so soon done when many General Officers of the Army had been waiting some Months without Dispatch Thus I presently got the Auditor's Place and had the Consta∣ble's Patent for it and when the Constable upon his own importunate Desire returned for  Spain  I was then garrisoned in the  Fauxburgs  of  Ghent  and we had Orders not to beat any Drums or to make the least Noise whilst the Constable passed in his Barque  Upon the Constable's going for  Spain  the  Count de Monterrey  who was  Master de Camp  of a  Spanish  Regiment was made Governour  pro Interim  and was after confirmed Governour General of the  Spanish Netherlands  where he continued six Years and was the best Gover∣nour I ever saw in them He paid the Soldiers Ten Months in the Year kept the Country in very good Order so that there was no Fear of Robbery but it cost the Lives of many Men and I have seen Fifteen or Sixteen hanging to∣gether upon the Canal betwixt  Brussels  and  Willibrook  for Robberies committed there  Not long after Count  Monterrey  's coming to the Government of  Flanders  the Congress was appointed at  Cologne  The Plenipotentiaries for our King were Sir  Leoline Jenkins  Judge of our Admiralty and Sir  Joseph Williamson  from both which I received Letters to go to the  Hague  to buy some Horses and Coaches for them and I was particularly recommended by them to Monsieur  Marine  First Esquire to the Prince of  Orange  to take his Opinion and Ad∣vice in the Choice of them I was to buy two Setts of Eight Horses for each Coach and the Coaches likewise if I could get them good and cheap After which I was desired to meet them at  Antwerp  in their Way to the Congress which I did according to their Directions At their coming to  Antwerp  they sent me to find the Duke of  Monmouth  and Sir  William Lockart  who were then with the King of  France  at a House belonging to the King of  Spain  Three Miles from  Brussels  I there found the aforenamed Persons with the King who was then marching to besiege  Maestricht  The Duke of  Monmouth  was made a Lieutenant General in the King's Army and Sir  William Lockhart  was our King's Ambassador with the  French  King At my Return to the Plenipo∣tentiaries I waited upon them to  Cologne  and after came back to  Brussels  where I was em∣ployed several times by their Excellencies be∣twixt  England  and  Cologne  upon great Occasi∣ons and was ordered by them to hold a strict Correspondence with Mr  Neipho  who lived then at  Antwerp  and was ordered to serve our Plenipotentiaries in all he could  At this time I found the Count  Monterrey  was no Friend to our Plenipotentiaries nor indeed to our Master or his Interest in any Case and was particularly a great Friend to the Capers at  Ostend  which Nest of Pyrates did much Hurt to our  English  Merchants seizing all  Eng∣lish  Ships they could find trading with  France  tho' their Trade was freely allowed by the Treaty of solemnly ratified by both Crowns But the Count  Monterrey  would not allow that Treaty because he said it was never published in  Flanders  which was their own Fault for the Ratification not the Publication makes all Treaties effectual And yet our King bore all these Affronts with incredible Patience expecting that the Count  Monterrey  would bet∣ter inform himself both of the Matters of Fact and of the Law for certainly the Articles of that Treaty were so plain and clear in the Point that the Case was adjudged as soon as compared with the Terms of the Treaty and the King  was still in Hopes that the Count would be made sensible of the unsufferable Affront as well as the Injustice of such Proceeding of the Privateers was to his Majesty even to such a Degree that his Majesty was thinking of another Way to right his Subjects if sudden Reparation came not by fair Means  Neither was the Count  Monterrey  only re∣fractory in this but was highly displeased at my being employed by the Plenipotentiaries at  Cologne  and told Father  Patrick  who was then called Abbot of  Thuly  that there was a little  Englishman  whose Name he knew not that was employed by the Ambassadors at  Cologne  of which Father  Patrick  gave me Notice and said that by the Description he was almost confi∣dent that his Excellency meant me And the next Day as I was going to Dinner at the  Great LookingGlass  in the  Berge Street  where I lodged a Servant told me there was a Gen∣tleman without that would speak with me Whereupon I went out to him and told him I was just going to Dinner He said he was Adjutant to his Excellency and that I must presently go with him Upon which I desired his Leave to go into my Chamber to put on another Peruke and that a Coach should be made ready in the mean time and so I would go with him When I came to Court I met Viscount  Berlin  who was then Governour of  Brussels  in the AntiChamber who told me his Excellency was in the next Room and would speak a Word with me and thereupon  led me in to his Excellency who asked me three or four Questions before I could answer him one of them As what I did at  Brussels  why I went so often to  Cologne  and  England  I told him I was employed by the  English  Am∣bassadors at  Cologne  to receive and send their Letters and that I should wait upon his Ex∣cellency in few Days to get an  Escorte  to carry some things from  England  to the Pleni∣potentiaries To which his Excellency replied That if what I said was true  Antwerp  was a fitter Place for me than  Brussels  and that he would not permit my longer Stay at  Brussels  To which I answered That there being no open War declared between  England  and  Spain  and so long as I obeyed the Laws of the Coun∣try it was lawful for me to stay And besides that I was indebted in my Lodging and could not go till I had satisfied All In fine his Excellency told me these were only Excuses which I made and commanded Viscount  Berlin  that the Adjutant should see me go out of Town that Night and that  Antwerp  was a much fitter Place for me than  Brussels  and so I left his Excellency and went presently to Father  Patrick  who lived near the Court to inform him of what had happened and desired him to send to Mr  Chaumont  for my Letters and open them in my Absence and then send them to me at Mr  Neipho  's at  Antwerp  The next Day the Letters came and one from Sir  Robert Southwell  to me giving an Ac∣count of the Peace signed that Day in Council  he being then Clerk of the Council He told me the Writings were scarce dry upon the Council Table but however he thought ne∣cessary to give me a speedy Account of it for the Information of others Father  Patrick  carried this Letter in his Pocket late on  Satur∣day  Night and said he came to give his Ex∣cellency Joy of the Peace that was made in  England  His Excellency answered it was true that the Peace was made and that he was very angry with the  Marquis de Fresno  who told him he had been all that Day in Council and was so weary that he could not give him an Ac∣count till the next Post of all the Particulars Whereupon Father  Patrick  said he would shew him all the Particulars which his Excellency was very desirous to see and having perused them he desired to know from whom he had them and the Father told him that Sir  Robert Southwell  had sent them to the Gentleman he had sent to  Antwerp  who had given him Leave to open his Letters in his Absence and to send them to him His Excellency presently said  I know Sir  Robert Southwell  to be a very honest Man and well inclined to us and if the Gen∣tleman I sent to  Antwerp  keeps a Correspondence with him I believe he may be honest also and therefore I pray send for him back and let him bring his little Horse with him of whom I have heard great Miracles  On  Monday  I came back and his Excellency sent for Mr  Chicati  who was Master of the Academy at  Brussels  to ride the Horse round the Park and to give him an  Account of the Horse who gave such an Ac∣count of him that his Excellency would by all Means buy the Horse of me I told him I could not sell him but if his Excellency would please to accept of him with his  English  Equipage I would present him but he refused to have him unless he might buy him and so I saved my Horse and my Honour also But I must not forget to do Father  Patrick  this Right that upon his Excellency's commanding me from  Brussels  he forthwith wrote Word of it to the Lord  Arlington  and what Danger I did run by being employed without a Commission But whilst I was at  Cologne  I received this Letter following from our Ambassadors Plenipotentia∣ries bearing Date in the Afternoon of the th of  July    Good Mr  Bulstrode  IT hath been our great Unhappiness that Mr  Frances  took his Leave of this Place this Morning without receiving from Mr  Chud∣leigh  Secretary to our Embassy those Dispat∣ches which he had prepared for his Conveyance so that he will appear to my Lord  Arlington  with his Hands in a manner empty You are therefore desired to follow him Day and Night with the Pacquet which Mr  Chudleigh  will deliver you as fast as you can possibly till you overtake him It is of very great Importance to the Publick and to us in particular You are not to stop tho' you follow him to  Whitehall  and you are to put the Pacquet into his own Hands without taking  any Notice of this Accident And if he should be arrived and shewed himself and delivered his Letters before you overtake him you are having shewed him this Letter from us to leave it to his Direction to excuse this Accident as well as he can and then you are to return hither without taking any farther Notice of this Occa∣sion We are Good Mr  Bulstrode  Your very Affectionate Friends to serve you  L JENKINS  JOS WILLIAMSON  Upon this emergent Occasion I got to  Antwerp  before Mr  Frances  tho' he parted from  Cologne  in the Morning and I did not leave it till late in the Evening and having shewed him my Letter from the Ambassadors and given him all his other Dispatches I hastened into  Flan∣ders  after I had taken a Turn into  Holland  and visited all Places both by Land and Sea and from thence I made a short Step into  Eng∣land  to give the King an Account of what I had seen which I put into Writing so fully to his Majesty's Satisfaction that he caused my Relation to be entered into the CouncilBook and having done this I went to find my Brother  Henry  who was very private in  London  after having had the Misfortune to kill a  Sussex  Gen∣tleman his Neighbour in a Duel tho' with all the Fairness and Honour so unfortunate an Accident is capable to have said for it and tho' wounded himself yet he was so severely  prosecuted that he must leave  England  Upon which Occasion after serious Consideration of his Condition I moved my Lord  Arlington  pri∣vately to get his Majesty's Leave that my Brother might go over with me into  Holland  and I would undertake to place him where he should give his Lordship constant Accounts of what passed in those Parts worthy his Know∣ledge and that by his great Diligence and In∣dustry should merit his Majesty's Pardon if not his Grace and Favour But in order to this I did beg his Lordship that a Letter might be written to the Master of the PacquetBoat at  Harwich  not to let the Boat go off with the Letters till my Arrival which should be with all Speed and that none who came with me might be questioned but that we might freely embark Which being granted to me I carried my Brother where I placed him very well for his Majesty's Service which he so punctually performed that he did not only get the King's Pardon under the Great Seal but did his Ma∣jesty such farther Service that he was rewarded for it From  Holland  I went into  Flanders  by the Way of  Sluys  and dined with Monsieur  La Leok  the Governour who was Brother to Monsieur  Odybe  of  Zealand  From  Flanders  I want to  Brussels  where I was not many Days before I received a Patent from the King to be his Agent at the Court at  Brussels  with a civil Letter to the Governour the  Count de Monter∣rey  telling him that for some particular Reasons he had not thought fit to send me those Powers  sooner which were antedated some Months be∣fore Upon this I was very kindly received by his Excellency and from that time acknowledged for the King's Minister the greatest Cause of which next to my Diligence in the King's Ser∣vice I must attribute to the Letter of Father  Patrick  to my Lord  Arlington  upon my being commanded from  Brussels  by the  Count de Mon∣terrey  and at that time acting without a Com∣mission But I must not forget that at my Return to  Brussels  I did disswade Father  Patrick  from going into  England  which before he had resolved to do knowing it would not only be very prejudicial to the King but very disadvan∣tageous to the Lord  Arlington  who at that time had many considerable Enemies and that no∣thing was moved more strongly against him than Father  Patrick  's lodging at his House in the  Park  of which my Lord's Enemies made great Use But his Lordship was so wise as to change the Pen for the White Staff had the Golden Key delivered to him and was declared Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Houshold and Sir  Joseph Williamson  was forthwith decla∣red and sworn Secretary of State in his Place who sent the several Letters of Complaint of the Violences committed upon our Merchants Ships by the insolent Capers of  Ostend  against whom we could never get any Justice done du∣ring the Government of the  Count de Monterrey  who would not own the Treaty of which was the Rule we were to go by in all the Dis∣putes between the  English  Merchants and the  Capers which Treaty was solemnly ratified by both Crowns Whereupon I received the fol∣lowing Letter from Sir  Joseph Williamson  da∣ted the st of  September  in these Words following  Good Mr  Bulstrode  IT is beyond Belief to see with what intole∣rable Insolence the Capers of  Ostend  treat all the King's Subjects The Treaty of  Madrid  in must be stood upon it being express in the Point and till the  Count de Monterrey  can have Time to consider and judge of it himself 'tis but just he should issue out present Orders to the Admiralty not to proceed in any of those Cases till his farther Order and that is the Point you must press immediately at Court and get clear and full Proofs of all Wrongs Injuries and Threats done or given out by them against any  Englishman  and demand Satisfaction of them and at the same time certify them over hither that if Justice be denied there the King may please to consider what he will farther do and continue to press hard for speedy Justice in the Case of all seized Ships and Goods and to get the Treaty of owned as the stand∣ing Rule in all those Concerns and be sure to insist that it hath been allowed in all Cases amongst us here in our Admiralty as Sir  Leoline Jenkins  Judge of that Court hath assured me  And the th of  December  following I re∣ceived this from him  Good Mr  Bulstrode  IT is said now that our People themselves either out of Ignorance or Malice have given the  Ostenders  great Advantages in several Cases by confessing their carrying double Bills of Lading and casting Papers overboard with such like indecent Practices which in all Times and in all Countries are reputed just Cause of Condemnation as was practised in  England  in the  Dutch  Wars If this be so they may thank themselves if such Cases be given against them But upon the whole Matter the Proceedings of the Capers should be straitly watched and upon what Grounds the Sentences are pretended to be given that so the Matter may be received and judged on this Side In the mean time it is manifest that the King omits nothing that he can possibly and lawfully do for his Subjects who are very unjust and ungrateful to his Majesty to lay any Part of the Blame upon the King or his Ministers as I hear some of them do It is necessary for you to have an exact List of all Ships at any time carried up by the  Ostenders  and I pray try to get one with Affidavits of the most notorious of these Capers for we may find a Way to meet with them when they least think of it I have sent you an Exemplar of the Trea∣ty of by which it will appear how noto∣riously their Proceedings are against the express Words of the Treaty What the Secretary of his Excellency says  That the Way to prevent all Disputes is to have a new Treaty made  is  true but we insist to have the present Treaty executed And if any Cases now arise where∣in no Provision is yet made it may not be impro∣per to propose the having a Rule made for such Cases but as far as the present Treaty reaches That is to be our standing Rule And as for the Ship with Plate on board I see no Reason That should differ the Case it coming from  Tangier  and let the Goods be what they would not be∣ing counterband the Ship being  English  ought to free them For by the Treaty an  English  Ship is at Liberty to carry all Goods even to the Enemies of  Spain  so they be not counter∣band and there is to be no Inquiry into her Lading all being free the Ship being  English  You are for the future to expect Mr Secre∣tary  Coventry  's Orders in all Matters from the King because you are now in his District he having prevailed with his Majesty that  Brussels  may be joined to his Province being under the  Spanish  Government  On the d of  January  I had this following Letter from Sir  Joseph Williamson  Good Mr  Bulstrode  I Would lose no Time upon the News of the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  's being the assured Successor to  Count de Monterrey  to pay him my Compliments and I beg Sir you will do me the Favour to deliver the inclosed with the Of∣fers of my humble Service as one that has ever had a very particular Value and Honour for the  Person and Merit of the Duke and in Confor∣mity to the Joy our Master hath at the Choice assuring you that the King hath a very good Opinion of the Duke and I hope the King of  Spain  his Master may have Cause to be glad by the good Effects it may produce during his Go∣vernment  Mr Secretary  Coventry  wrote to me That denying the Treaty of  Flanders  was of so great Concern having been so long since ratified that I should inform my self of the  Count de Monterrey  before his Departure for  Spain  whether he made any Scruple of owning it of which I gave Mr Secretary an Account that his Excellency made Difficulty to acknow∣ledge it Whereupon Mr Secretary answered That he never thought it would have been a Question with the Governour of  Flanders  whether a Treaty of universal Extent made signed and ratified at  Madrid  should be com∣plied with in  Flanders  For if  Ostend  was in the King of  Spain  's Dominions the Treaty reached it Mr Secretary upon this sent an Account to our Ambassador in  Spain  not to in∣treat an Order but to expostulate the Matter with that Crown and the Secretary had for Answer That they admired how his Excellen∣cy should make a Question of observing that Treaty so nationally ratified as it was That then they had sent Orders upon it which be∣fore they could not have thought necessary Count  Monterrey  did then before his Departure  send a Letter to our King to send over Captain  Berthold  who was then Prisoner in  England  to be tryed in  Flanders  but his Majesty would not make such a Precedent against himself as not to vindicate his Flag's Right against any thing that should affront it when he finds them in his own Dominions and would give this Answer to  Baron de Bergeyk  whenever he should demand it In the mean time that what he wrote was only to inform me of the State of the Thing that if it should be dis∣coursed by any of the Ministers I might be furnished with Reasons to defend the Proceed∣ings of my Master but not as ordered so to do but as of my self That the  Count de Mon∣terrey  was much misinformed in the Matter the Captain's refusing to strike being witnessed by the whole Sloop's Crew both Officers and Soldi∣ers That this was done with reproachful Terms commanding our Captain to strike in the Name of the King of  Spain  an Insolence never com∣mitted before and against the Peace betwixt the two Crowns and pyratically forced away the  English  Ship being under the King's Flag in our own Channel That this being the Case and the Offender taken on the King's Ground the Isle of  Wight  there could be no more Question of the King's Right to try this Man than if he had come and robbed in the  Thames  That I might likewise say that Captain  Berthold  and his Comerades have been tryed by a Jury of Twelve Men Half of which according to our Law were Aliens and found Guilty and  have received their Sentence and have humbly petitioned the King for a Release of their Im∣prisonment to which the King hath consented and hath given Order accordingly and that the Matter of the Flag upon the Insult offered to Mr  Porter  his Majesty's Envoy to the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  which Insult was before  Ostend  was laid by till the Arrival of  Don Pedro de Ronquillos  who was daily expected his Goods being already come  About this time I had a Letter from Sir  Joseph Williamson  wherein he told me he was sorry to hear of nothing but Words in the Business of our Ships That Provocations were rather daily renewed than any Satisfaction given and even Insults of a higher Nature That  Don Francisco Marco de Velasco  Envoy from the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  to compliment the King upon his coming to the Government of  Flan∣ders  had taken his Leave and  Don Pedro de Ronquillos  was daily expected as Envoy Ex∣traordinary from  Spain  who had promised to begin his Business with that of the  English  Ships carried up by the  Ostenders  which was become so clamorous a Cause that without some spee∣dy Reparation no body knew what would fol∣low That indeed the Insolence of those Ca∣pers was intolerable and not only those but the  Majorcans  in the  Mediterranean  were grown insupportable by the Number of Com∣plaints brought daily to the King for which he had commanded his Ambassador at  Madrid  to declare that if speedy and effectual Repara∣tion  were not made his Majesty could not lon∣ger withstand the thing and that it would be impossible to deny Letters of Reprisal to so many crying Cases of his Subjects that called for them That it happening that the Yacht which carried Mr  Porter  his Majesty's Envoy to return the Compliment of the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  coming before  Ostend  met with a  Spanish  Man of War which according to Custom he required to strike and for that Purpose pierced his Rigging with some Shot but the Man of War not only finally refused to strike but at last gave the Yacht one Gun with a Bullet in it which was resented as it ought to be and put into a legal Way of ex∣amining first and would after be proceeded in according to the ordinary Custom of the Law as a Crime of a high Misdemeanor and con∣stantly punished as such by the Laws of our Kingdom but because  Don Pedro de Ronquillos  was soon expected at  London  this Business would be deferred till his Arrival  Being informed by a Person of Honour at  Brussels  that the  Count de Monterrey  would return into  Spain  by the Way of  France  be∣cause his Excellency thought his Presence would not be acceptable to our King I did thereupon acquaint Mr Secretary  Coventry  with it who told me That having acquainted the King with what I wrote his Majesty was much surprized not knowing the Cause for such a Jealousy That it was true the daily Complaints made by his Subjects of the ill Treatments they received  from  Ostend  and the small or no Satisfaction that he had received notwithstanding the re∣iterated Letters of his Majesty did much dis∣please him But as to the Person of his Ex∣cellency the King had no particular Dissatisfa∣ction but on the contrary if his Excellency pleased to see  England  in his Return he needed no way doubt of receiving Respects suitable to his Quality and high Employment he had in  Flanders  However the  Count de Monterrey  did not think fit to pass thro'  England  in his Return but went thro'  France  In  September  following the King wrote a Letter to the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  which was sent to me from  Windsor  to be delivered which being faithfully translated from the  French  runs thus in  English  My Cousin  I Have a great Regret to write to you upon the Complaints of my Subjects but that I am daily importuned concerning the Hindrance of their Commerce and Navigation coming from the Ports under Obedience of his Catholick Majesty That which I shall at present tell you is of a double Affront by two Privateers of  Ostend  the one commanding a Frigat of Twelve Guns with Two Hundred Men the other of Six Guns with One Hundred Men offered to me as well as my Subjects A small Ship carrying my Colours and having in Convoy a Galliot Merchant belonging to  London  meeting with the said two Priva∣teers about the Height of my Island of  Guernsey  gave them usual Notice to strike which they did not only refuse but by an unheard of Insolence commanded my Ship to strike to them and to compleat their Outrage took the said Merchant and carried it to  Ostend  You may well judge that this Proceeding is not agreeable to Friends and Allies And therefore having represented it to you I believe you will give your Orders for the Punishment of these sort of People as well in this as in all others of the like Nature as my Agent at  Brussels  shall from time to time in∣form you of that I may have no Cause to com∣plain farther but leave my self to your Justice in this Affair and in all others to your Care for Preservation of the Amity between me and the Catholick King which shall be ever dear to me from  My Cousin  Your Affectionate Cousin  CHARLES  R  I received a Letter from Mr Secretary  Coventry  dated the th of  November  Old Style in these Words following  Good Mr  Bulstrode  TO morrow the Earls of  Arlington  and  Ossory  are to embark for the  Hague  The Suddenness of the Journey gives great Jealou∣sy of a Treaty of Peace of which there is no∣thing that remaining wholly under the Conduct of Sir  William Temple  and they have no Cha∣racter  but their own Titles and are purely sent to the Prince of  Orange  The Merchants who have Interest in the Ship St  George  of  London  have made their Complaints to the King and Council and his Majesty is resolved to speak roundly about it to the  Baron de Bergeyk  when he comes But in the mean time it will surely be very proper for the Merchants concerned that by your Intercession they should have true Copies of the Proofs and Reason of the Judgment which cannot in Reason be denied them which I will send to the Judge of our Admiralty and if there be real Exceptions in Point of Law Matter of Fact being stated on both Sides our Business will go on much more formally and the King make his Complaints upon a more so∣lid Ground than the bare Allegation of the Merchants interessed upon whose Complaint the Council would advise nothing positive tho' they were very sensible of the Injustice In the  Inte∣rim  I am commanded by his Majesty that you should exhibite the State of the Case to the Mi∣nisters at  Brussels  and demand in his Majesty's Name that either the Fact be avowed or else disproved by letting you see the authentick Do∣cument of the Court and the King will upon a true State of the Matter consider how to redress such of his Subjects as have truly been wronged contrary to the Treaty of And as for such who by their own Folly in carrying double Cockets and other forbidden Ways have brought them∣selves into those Streights they must be content wi  such Misfortunes as they bring upon them∣selves  by their own ill Conduct I have sent the Merchants concerned with the State of their Case to the  Count de Bergeyk  and I desire to hear from you how he does report it at  Brussels  and what Success they are like to have  I received a Letter dated at  Whitehall  the th of  February  from Mr Secretary  Coventry  in these Words  Good Mr  Bulstrode  THO' we are in Peace with all the World as with  Spain  yet all the Ships of  France Holland  and all the rest of  Europe  do not give us the tenth Part of that Trouble that the King of  Spain  's Dominions do But I hope your new Governour will repair the Grievances our Mer∣chants have long been under and I shall be very glad his good Inclinations with those which  Don Pedro de Ronquillos  expresses towards our Merchants might appear and that we shall re∣ceive some Satisfaction therein and that the good Assurances the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  giveth us will appear by the Effects You may assure the Duke that my own Inclinations to keep all things quiet are sufficiently known but the Mockeries and Prevarications of the  Spanish  Ministers cannot be longer palliated Reprisals are granted by the Treaty after Justice sought any long Time and whether that hath not been denied and the Time reasonable for Satisfaction  escaped let the World judge I am very con∣cernedly  Your Humble Servant  H COVENTRY  At last after many Letters from Mr Secre∣tary  Coventry  and reiterated Addresses of mine we obtained this ensuing Order from his Ex∣cellency which being faithfully translated out of  Spanish  runs thus being signed by the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  and by his Secretary  Turietta  LET the ancient Order be observed which is to give Communication unto both Par∣ties of the Proofs and of all other Documents of the Process which I do not only command should be executed in that which is under Con∣sultation concerning the Ship  St George  of  London  but also in all other Processes which the Admiralty Council may have withdrawn or henceforth shall withdraw to their Board And I do likewise ordain That this Resolution shall serve as a Rule for all Times And I do also or∣dain That in all Suits which shall happen with the Subjects of his Majesty of  Great Britain  the Treaty of the Year be observed and that it be the Law by which he judged not on∣ly the depending Processes but those also which may offer hereafter And I do likewise command the Council before Sentence be pronounced to consult me in all such Suits which are now de∣pending  between the Privateers of  Ostend  and the Subjects of the King of  Great Britain  in the Decision whereof all the Votes as well of the Counsellours as of the Associates shall not be conformable and that each one of those that shall have given their Votes do respectively ex∣press the Reasons upon which they ground their Opinion the Plurality of Votes notwithstanding And whereas it is convenient for the Service of the King our Master and for the good Admini∣stration of Justice that all the Suits now depen∣ding be finished with all Speed I do order the Council to apply themselves with particular Care to the avoiding superfluous and frivolous Delays and to meet every Day that no Time be lost in Decision of Affairs of so high a Consequence  Dated at  Brussels    Signed by the  Duc de Villa Hermosa Conde de Luna  c  By Order from his Excellency Signed underneath  TURIETTA  About this time the Earl of  Shaftsbury  wrote the following Letter to my Lord  Carlisle  da∣ted the th of  March    My Lord  I Very much approve of what my Lord  Mordaunt  and you told me you were about and should if I had been in Town readily have joined with you and upon the least Notice have come up for it's certainly all our Duties and particularly mine who have borne such Offices under the  Crown to improve any Opportunity of a good Correspondence and Understanding between the Royal Family and the People and to leave it impossible for the King to apprehend that we stand upon any other Terms that are not as good for him as necessary for us Neither can we fear to be accounted Undertakers at the next Meeting of Parliament for I hope it shall never be thought unfit for any Number of Lords to give the King privately their Opinion when asked which in former Days thro' all the Northern Kingdoms nothing of great Moment was acted by their Kings without the Advice of the most considerable and active Nobility that were within Distance tho' they were not of the ordinary PrivyCouncil such Occasions being not always of that Nature as did require the Assembling the great Council or Parliament Besides there are none so likely as us nor Time so proper as now to give the only Advice I know truly serviceable to the King affectionate to the Duke and secure to the Country which is a new Parliament which I do undertake at any time to convince your Lordship is the clear Interest of all them But in the mean time I must beg yours and my Lord  Mordaunt  's Pardon that I come not up as I intended for I hear from all Quarters of Letters from  Whitehall  that do give Notice that I am coming up to Town that a great Office with a strange Name is preparing for me and such like I am ashamed I was thought so easy a Fool by those who should know me better But I assure your Lordship there's no Place or Con∣dition  will invite me to Court during this Par∣liament nor until I see the King thinketh fre∣quent Parliaments as much his Interest as they are the People's Right For until then I can neither serve the King as I could nor think a great Place safe enough for a second Adventure When our great Men have tried a little longer they will be of my Mind in the mean time no kind of Usage shall put me out of that Duty and Respect I owe to the King and Duke But I think it would not be amiss for the Men that are in great Offices who are at Ease and where they would be to be ordinarily civil to a Man in my Condition since they may be assured that all their great Places put together shall not buy me from my Principles My Lord I beseech you to impart this to the Earl of  Salisbury  my Lord of  Falconbridge  and my Lord  Hollis  and when you four command me up I will obey I am sorry my Lord  Hallifax  had no better Success in his Summer's Negotiation and that his Uncle Sir  William  could make no nearer Approach to the Ministers of State than the Kissing of the King's Hand I fear it is fatal to his Lordship to go so far and no farther My Dear Lord  I am most Affectionately and Sincerely Your Lordship's most Devoted Servant  In  September  Mr Secretary  Coventry  wrote me this ensuing Letter  Good Mr  Bulstrode  I Understand that  Don Pedro de Ronquillos  and the  Sieur Decio  are come in Commission to  Ostend  and have made Bargains with some particular Merchants by way of Composition tho' nothing concluded with his Majesty as to Right but these very Bargains and Contracts made with them by  Don Pedro  and  Decio  who is a Burgher of  Ostend  are neither respected nor regarded and if these Affronts are done and maintained by Order from the King of  Spain  we must look upon it as a Violation of the Treaty But if it be done by Particulars that will not give Obedience to his Catholick Majesty nor Sa∣tisfaction to us I hope we shall not be blamed if we right our selves by Reprisals allowed by the Treaty against such as both in Contempt of our King and their own do impudently continue their Insolences Sir I pray you to assure his Excellency that I have done my utmost to com∣pose these Differences but the no Satisfaction received and the many Insolences since done maketh it impossible to suffer any much longer Delay The Parliament now approaches and when the oppressed Merchants shall there tell their Story I know what Reproaches will be uttered against those Ministers that have not been quicker in giving Remedies to these Vio∣lences I am sorry Sir I can give you no other Answer upon this Matter but without speedy Reparation Reprisals cannot be gainsayed and  what will follow then the Lord knows I am Sir with great Sincerity  Your most Humble Servant  H COVENTRY  About this time his Majesty gave me Leave to come into  England  and sent the  Mary  Yacht to  Ostend  for me and some time after the King was pleased to send me to

Januier    Signé plus bas  HENRY COVENTRY  In  June  the two Houses were in a great Heat with each other whereupon the Ninth of that Month the Black Rod knocked at the Door of the House of Commons and said the King commanded them to wait upon him presently in the House of Lords The King then told them That he had called them  together to secure their Religion and Proper∣ties which he hoped they would have done successfully seeing he had not offered any Bu∣siness of his own to hinder or obstruct it and had let them sit longer than he intended at first That he designed only to have adjourned them for a short Time but finding some of his and their Enemies had been able to make Differen∣ces between them which could not be accom∣modated by any thing less than a Prorogation he very unwillingly prorogued them to the th of  October  when he hoped to meet them again in a better Temper without springing new Differences or reviving the old The Members then posted down into their several Countries dissatisfied enough but with whom or with what they could not tell They all agreed the King did no more than Necessity required him to do and some believed he had not done so much as he ought to have done or must quickly do for that a Prorogation was not likely to do the Business but that the Par∣liament must be dissolved for that no Good could be expected from them and that it was lost Labour to try them longer After this Prorogation the Marquess of  Winchester  and the Earl of  Shaftsbury  appeared at Court which was done by Permission for the King being asked if he would not take it ill if they came his Majesty's Answer was That he forbid no Body without any farther Encouragement It seems the Two beforementioned went likewise to St  James  's and were at the Duke's Rising  and were received very kindly by his Royal Highness which gave new Occasion of Talk and that the latter of them two would come soon into Play The Parliament being again farther prorogued and afterwards assembling the Lords were very hot upon the Point of the Legality of that Parliament and tho' those that opposed were so few that it was not worth being put to the Question yet it lasted a long Debate and when the Debate was over it was moved that those who first stirred the Scruple should be punished and then how many should be accounted liable Whether the Duke of  Buckingham  who first moved it or others with him And how many and who Upon which three others were named  viz  the Earls of  Salisbury  and  Shaftsbury  and Lord  Wharton  And a Debate arose whether those Lords should withdraw as criminal till their Punishment was agreed upon The Question being put Whether the offending Lords should withdraw it was carried in the Affirmative Then the House called for the Duke of  Buckingham  who was gone upon which it was ordered that the Black Rod should take his Grace into Custody and bring him to the House the next Day Then the other Three were called and requi∣red to ask Pardon of the King and the House which they refused and were thereupon sent Prisoners to the  Tower  The Duke of  Buck∣ingham  appeared the next Day and was sent Prisoner to the  Tower  because he refused like∣wise to make the Acknowledgment  Wednesday  the th of  February  the Peti∣tion of the Earl of  Shaftsbury  was read in the House submitting to what the Lords should enjoin him in begging Pardon of the King and their Lordships Whereupon the Lord Chan∣cellor told the House That the King had also received a Petition from the said Earl but un∣derstanding that he endeavoured to free him∣self from their Censure by an Appeal to the King's Bench during the Adjournment of Par∣liament his Majesty thought not fit to declare his Pleasure as to his Enlargement till the House of Lords had taken the Case into their Consideration Upon which after a long De∣bate it was ordered That the Records of the King's Bench Court should be brought into the House and the Earl's Business proceeded upon the next Day when the Lords declared That it was a Breach of Privilege for any of their House to appeal to an inferior Court during the Sitting of Parliament That however this should not be any Bar to any Plea the Earl should make However it seems that some Time after the Earl of  Shaftsbury  moved again by his Council in the King's Bench for ano∣ther  Habeas Corpus  upon which his Lordship was brought thither and the Business was agreed by Council on both Sides and the Judges de∣clared that his Lordship being committed by a superior Court  viz  the House of Lords of which his Lordship was a Member they could not enquire into the Legality or Illegality of his Commitment nor could they give him any  Relief and so remanded his Lordship back to the  Tower  Upon this the Earl petitioned the House of Lords to know whether he should be released or not To which the Lords told him considering he had added a new Offence to that for which he was committed much more heinous than the first in applying himself to the King's Bench with a new  Habeas Corpus  which was a farther Contempt of the Authority of the House of Lords they would not release him To which his Lordship answered That the Crime for which he was committed was the only Matter in Question before them and there∣fore if they looked upon his Submission as Satisfaction enough for the Fault he had com∣mitted he might be allowed by the House to make his Application to the King for his Liber∣ty but after a long Debate it was carried in the Negative That he should not be allowed by the House to make his Application to the King and that they were resolved not to release him till they had examined all his Faults together Then the Lords resolved to have the Earl once more before them and having perused the Record of his second  Habeas Corpus  they agreed that his applying again to an inferior Court in the time of an Adjournment which is a virtual Session of Parliament to be relieved against the Judgment of the House of Lords was a Breach of their Privileges and resolved That he should answer the Crime at the Bar of their House the next Day but the other Crime far which he was committed seemed to be for∣given  In the End the Earl finding his Peti∣tion to the Lords rejected there for want of having behaved himself with due Submission and Obedience to the King did then again pe∣tition his Majesty but either uncarefully or too capriciously insinuated in his Petition that he did it by Order of the House of Lords which the King took ill and refused the Petition upon it After this the Lords were again upon this Business and after many refined Questions the whole Matter hung upon some Words which were alledged his Lordship should have said at the King's Bench Bar upon his bringing his last  Habeas Corpus  and that the Words then spoken by his Lordship were derogatory to the House of Lords and to their Power Whereupon Wit∣nesses were called in and heard who proved so little to the Earl's Disadvantage that he was at length called for to make his Submission to the House which his Lordship did with all the Words and Ceremonies exacted of him so much to the Satisfaction of the House that they or∣dered an Address to be made to the King to signify to his Majesty that they the House of Lords were entirely satisfied and that the whole Business of his Lordship's Enlargement or farther Confinement rested with his Maje∣sty Upon which his Lordship was that Night remanded to the  Tower  The next Morning the White Staves of the Lords House in the Name of the whole House made an Address to his Majesty in the Case of the Earl of  Shafts∣bury  and the Lord Treasurer the Morning  following made Report to the House that his Majesty was satisfied and that he would gra∣ciously please to order that the said Earl should be delivered from the  Tower  which was done accordingly and the next Day the Earl of  Shaftsbury  had his Liberty and took his Place in the House of Lords  About this time I received a Letter from the King to the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  brought me from  Windsor  by Mr  Puckle  who was then employed by the Merchants That it being long since the Merchants first applied them∣selves to his Majesty for Redress in  Flanders  and the King having long expected from the Interposition of himself in that Affair and the several Memorials given in his Name to the Mi∣nisters of  Spain  from time to time residing as also by his Minister at  Brussels  that his Sub∣jects would sooner have found the good Effects of their Instances but especially being so seri∣ously promised upon the coming of their De∣puties with  Sieur Decio  their Fiscal all Dif∣ferences would be speedily adjusted Yet to his great Dissatisfaction he found that several Months had been taken up by them in Confe∣rences and yet the Affair appeared so far from being ended that it seemed to be industriously protracted And his Subjects therefore freshly importuning him with reiterated Complaints of their Oppressions and imploring that he would provide for their Satisfaction by such Ways as were agreeable to his royal Dignity His Maje∣sty therefore calling to Mind with what Pa∣tience  he had waited for Reparation of their Damages and having used all amicable Ways depending upon him was now constrained to let his Excellency know That if Justice were not speedily administred to his Subjects he should be obliged by the Protection he owes them to give them Leave to take their Satisfaction by such Ways as the Law of Nations and his Treaty of with the King of  Spain  allowed And therefore the King seriously desired his Ex∣cellency to give effectual Orders to those con∣cerned that what had been wrongfully done or taken from his Majesty's Subjects by the Privateers of  Ostend  might be adjudged and re∣stored to them or their Value that thereby the Necessity of having Recourse to severer Remedies might be prevented which his Majesty promised himself from his Love to Justice and his great Desire to preserve a good Friendship and Corre∣spondence betwixt the two Crowns 'Tis true indeed we had better Orders from the Duke than we had formerly from the Count  Monter∣rey  but the Difference was that the  Count de Monterrey  would always have his Orders pun∣ctually obeyed and the Orders of the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  were seldom complied with so that his Majesty's Subjects were very little the better for all the good Orders of the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  Not long after this I received a Letter from the King to the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  which being faithfully translated run thus  Cousin  THE Desire I have always had and have to do and perform all things on my Part that may effectually conduce to the constant maintaining of a perfect Amity between me and my good Brother the Catholick King and the Care which you have also used on your Part to the same good Purpose ever since you came to the Government of  Flanders  made me believe that my Subjects might have exercised their Commerce and Navigation without any Hinde∣rance or Interruption from those of his Catholick Majesty and the rather because you once sent the Sieur  Decio  Fiscal of  Ostend  hither into  England  to adjust such Matters as were then in Difference and to prevent the like for the future Notwithstanding which I am informed that a Difficulty is raised concerning the Liberty of Trade to my Subjects from one Port to another of such Countries as are in Enmity with  Spain  but in Peace and Amity with  England  tho' there be not the least Ground or Shadow of any such Exception between me and his Catholick Majesty nor is the like practised or pretended by any other Nation in Amity with me Yet the Admiralty of  Ostend  refuseth to allow my Subjects that Liberty upon a Pretence that the said Fiscal when he was lately here had given undeniable Arguments in that Behalf But I am well infor∣med that when the said Fiscal was here and presented this Objection with some others against the Liberty of Trade Sir  Leoline Jenkins  Judge  of my Admiralty and Sir  Robert Southwell  Knights being appointed to examine the Fiscal's Papers did make Answer thereto in Writing in the Month of  July  and in particular to that very Point touching the Right of Freedom in Trade from one Port to another and that never any Answer or Reply being made thereunto it was believed that the said Fiscal and all those concerned in that Question had finally acquies∣ced therein A Copy of the Answer made by the said two Knights to the Fiscal's Objection I have caused to be transmitted to my Resident at  Brussels  and commanded him to impart the same unto you not doubting but the Arguments there∣in contained will appear to you so strongly groun∣ded upon Treaties and Reason that I shall not need to press you for Justice in so clear a Case but that that you will of your own Accord and free Motion adjust and finally determine this Point according to the Rules set down in the aforesaid Treaty of between me and his Catholick Majesty so as my Subjects may receive no farther Interruption in the lawful Exercise of their Freedom in Trade and Navigation which is the only Intent of this my Letter to you with the Assurance whereof I remain  Cousin  Your Good Friend  CHARLES  R  About this time Letters from the  Hague  told us that the States General and their Confede∣rates had accepted of  Nimmeguen  for the Place  of Treaty at the Mediation and Recommen∣dation of his Majesty of  Great Britain  which was forthwith communicated to  Monsieur de Ravigni  the  French  Ambassador who told our King that his most Christian Majesty would not send his Ambassadors till the Emperor had agreed to some Accommodation upon the two preliminary Points of Prince  William  of  Fur∣stenberg  and the Money belonging to the  French  King seized at  Cologne  Hereupon our King sent to his Ambassador at the  Hague  to press the States in that Matter who answered That they did not think fit to meddle in that Matter but left it entirely to the Emperor's Pleasure whose Minister at the  Hague  declared in the Name of the Emperor That his Imperial Ma∣jesty was willing to suspend the Process against the Prince and would agree that in the Assem∣bly at  Nimmeguen  Consideration should be had of that Prince's Detention and of seizing the Money at  Cologne  but that the Prince being a natural born Subject of the Emperor he could not admit to put him into a third Hand upon which the King of  Great Britain  and the States were satisfied  In the Year I had Notice given me by Mr Secretary  Coventry  That the King was re∣solved I should follow the Camp and had or∣dained an Allowance of  L Sterling  for my Equipage That I should be careful to write all that passed in the Army and leave some Person at  Brussels  to write all from thence as fully as I used to do That the Continuance of my Di∣ligence  and Exactness was the Way to have my Pains valued which would at last bring a good Recompence with it  In  August  I was advised by Mr Secre∣tary  Coventry  that  Mynheer van Benningham  the  Dutch  Envoy had told him that in Dis∣course with  Count de Basigni  a Lieutenant Ge∣neral of the  Spanish  Troops I had told him at  Brussels  that the Prince of  Orange  had raised his Siege of  Charleroy  without fighting to make himself King of his own Country with many other things very prejudicial to the Honour and Trust of the Prince which being known to the King and Duke they were much concerned at it And that it would therefore become me pre∣sently to apply my self to Count  Basigni  to get a Certificate from him that I had said no such thing to him The same Story was also told me by Mr  Laury Hyde  who was newly arrived from the  English  Court Upon these In∣formations I went forthwith to Count  Basigni  and shewed him Mr Secretary's Letter which was wrote by Order from the King Where∣upon  Count de Basigni  told me I had always been esteemed a  Frenchman  and that I had a great Inclination for that Nation That he had endeavoured to do me that Right as to assure the contrary by saying I was unsatisfied at the Prince of  Orange  's raising his Siege of  Charleroy  without fighting which he had purposely done to make himself King of  Holland  and the Low Countries I then asked him whether he had ever heard me say any such thing He then  confessed he never heard me say so but that what he had said was in my Justification and that I was not the Man that others apprehended me to be That I might make a good Excuse to the Secretary by saying  Count de Basigni  not being well was gone to drink the  Spaw  Waters and that at his Return I would get such a Cer∣tificate from him as was required That in the mean time the Business would be forgotten and I should hear no more of it But I told him plainly that since his Tongue had been too long in speaking that as from me which I never said whereby my Honour was in great Hazard his Hand was not too short to give me Satisfaction by his Pen which if he refused he must do it with his Sword and that my Coach was at his Door and that I would carry him out of the Ramparts and the Business would quickly be decided To which he an∣swered he would much more willingly give me Satisfaction with his Sword than with his Pen after he had heard Mass at the  Domini∣cans  Upon which I left him and went to the  Dominicans  soon after which the Count came thither and when the Mass was ended we went out together to my Coach and putting him before me as I was going in after him  Don Antonio de Lera  and  Don Martin de les Ries  two  Spanish  Officers stopp'd me and said we should not go together for that they knew there was a Quarrel betwixt us and that they would secure and take  Count de Basigni  Priso∣ner from me and would forthwith give Notice  of it to the Governour Viscount  Berling  Whereupon I went into my Coach and sent immediately to Mr  Lent  who was Resident for the King of  Denmark  He came presently to me to whom I told all that happened Where∣upon he offered me his Service and said he would stand by me and serve me in all I should desire of him Soon after Viscount  Berlin  came to me to let me know that he would endeavour to compose the Difference amicably between Count  Basigni  and me in the Absence of the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  and that he had secured Count  Basigni  in his own House but durst not meddle with me because I was a publick Minister but desired I would not stir abroad and that he hoped to compose the Dif∣ference friendly between us I sent forthwith to Mr  Hyde  to desire him to take my Coach to  Bruin le Comte  to see the Prince of  Orange  and to make my Excuse for not waiting upon his Highness till I had freed my self from the Imputation that was cast upon me I had not been long at Home but  Count de Tanuti  the Pope's Internuncio accompanied with the Ab∣bot of  Leyde  came to see me and offered their Service for accommodating the Business between us The Internuncio told me and so did the Abbot of  Leyde  that they could not advise  Count de Basigni  to give me such a Certificate as I desired for that would be to give himself the Lye but I told them he must either do that or fight with me and that I had rather lose my Life than my Honour  In the Afternoon of the same Day Mr  Ly∣seca  the  Spaniard  who was Superintendant in the Place of  Don Pedro de Ronquillos  came to see me Amongst other things he told me that perchance he might do me some Service because by virtue of his Office he could examine upon Oath any Person that was Prisoner upon such an Occasion and that if I would let him know what Questions he should ask him he would not fail to do it and that he would take a  Commis  with him who should put in Writing all that was said of which he would give me a Copy attested under his Hand and Seal Upon this I told him that he would please to examine Count  Basigni  how he came to be a Prisoner and if there was a Quarrel betwixt us and upon what Account And that whether he had heard me at any time especially since the Siege of  Charleroy  speak any thing against the Prince of  Orange  that might reflect upon his Honour or Trust reposed in him by the States General of the United Provinces and that he the Prince of  Orange  did not fight then be∣cause he would make himself King of that Coun∣try To which Count  Basigni  answered upon Oath That he never heard me speak any thing tending to the Dishonour of the Prince of  Orange  or breaking of his Trust to the States General because if he had heard any such thing he would have questioned me for it When Mr  Lyseca  gave me this Account the next Day I told him I should be very well satisfied if he would give me three Certificates signed by  himself and his  Commis  signifying what he had told me the one should be for the King and the Duke the second for the Prince of  Orange  and the third to be left in the StadtHouse at  Brussels in perpetuam rei memoriam  which was done accordingly and all our Differences were amicably composed The King my Master with his Royal Highness were entirely satisfied with my Proceeding and Conduct in this Busi∣ness as Mr Secretary  Coventry  wrote me Word and the Prince of  Orange  was fully satisfied as Mr  Hyde  informed me and as I understood afterwards from the Prince himself But this Affair stuck upon  Count de Basigni  as an ill Mark upon him who lived not many Years after it  In  March  the House of Commons re∣solved that those Persons who either advised compelled assisted or encouraged the raising levying or sending his Majesty's Subjects into the military Service of the  French  King since the King's Proclamation to the contrary are and shall be esteemed Enemies to the Safety of the Kingdom Then they agreed to present an Address to his Majesty in these Words fol∣lowing  May it please Your Majesty  WE your Majesty's most loyal Subjects the Commons assembled in Parliament do with unspeakable Joy and Comfort present our humble Thanks to Your Majesty for Your most gracious Acceptance of your Address and that  You have been pleased to express in your prince∣ly Wisdom Your Concurrence in Opinion to the Preservation of the  Spanish Netherlands  We do with all earnest and repeated Desires implore Your Majesty that You would be pleased to take Care to prevent those Dangers that may arise to these Kingdoms by the present Power of the  French  King and the Progress he daily makes in the  Netherlands  and many other Places and therefore that Your Majesty would not defer the entring into such Alliances as may attain those Ends And in Case it shall happen in pursuance of such Alliances that Your Majesty shall be en∣gaged in a War with the  French  King we hold our selves obliged and we do with all Humility and Chearfulness assure Your Majesty that we Your Majesty's most loyal Subjects shall always be ready upon Signification in Parliament fully from time to time to assist Your Majesty with such Aids and Supplies as by the Divine Assi∣stance may enable Your Majesty to prosecute the same with Success All which we humbly offer to Your Majesty as the unanimous Sense and Desire of the whole Nation  To this the King returned no Answer and therefore this farther Address was also made by both Houses of Parliament  May it please Your Majesty  WE Your most loyal Subjects the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Knights Citizens and Burgesses in Parliament assembled  find our selves obliged in Duty and Faithfulness to Your Majesty and in Discharge of the Trust reposed in us by those whom we represent most humbly to offer to Your Majesty's serious Conside∣ration that the Minds of Your Majesty's People are much disquieted with the manifest Dangers arising to Your Majesty's Kingdoms by the Growth and Power of the  French  King especi∣ally by the Acquisitions already and the farther Progress likely to be made by him in the  Spanish Netherlands  in the Preservation and Security whereof we humbly conceive the Interest of Your Majesty and the Safety of Your People are singly concerned And therefore we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to take the same into Your Royal Consideration and to strengthen Your self with such stricter Alliances as may secure Your Majesty and preserve and secure the said  Nether∣lands  and thereby quiet the Minds of Your Ma∣jesty's People  The King's Answer to this Address was to this Effect That his Majesty was of Opinion that the Conservation of  Flanders  was of great Importance to  England  That he would use all Means in his Power for the Preservation of  Flanders  as could consist with the Safety of the Kingdom And the th of  April  his Majesty sent this Message to the House of Commons  HIS Majesty having considered your late Address and finding some Alterations in Affairs abroad thinks it necessary to put you in Mind that the only Way to prevent the Dangers that may arise to these Kingdoms must be by putting his Majesty timely in a Condition to make such fitting Preparations as may enable him to do what shall be most for the Security of them  The th of  April  Resolved in the House of Commons  THAT the Thanks of this House be given to his Majesty for laying before them his Majesty's Sense of the Posture of Affairs abroad and to let his Majesty know that in order to his Majesty's Preparations in pursuance of their Ad∣dress for the Safety of the Kingdom they had provided a Security of  l  and that what∣soever of the same shall be expended accordingly shall be by them reimbursed and whensoever the Posture of his Majesty's Affairs shall require their Attendance in Parliament they would be ready to aid and assist him as the Nature of his Maje∣sty's Affairs should require  The th of this Month his Majesty sent for the House of Commons and told them that the Two Hundred Thousand Pounds they had given him Credit for was not sufficient for making the necessary Preparations and there∣fore demanded Six Hundred Thousand Pounds  more but the House desired his Majesty he would give them Leave to defer that Matter till they came together again for that their House was at present very empty and the d of  May  his Majesty sent a Message to the House of Commons to attend him presently in the  BanquetingHouse  where he made a Speech to them and they being returned went into a grand Committee of the whole House to consider of his Majesty's Speech and resolved That an Humble Address be presented to the King and a Committee was appointed to draw up an Address with Reasons why they could not comply with his Majesty's Speech till such Alliances as they desired were entered into and farther shewing the Necessity of such spee∣dy Alliances and that when such Alliances were made to give his Majesty Assurances of speedy and chearful Supplies for supporting and maintaining such Alliances After this the King sent again for the House of Commons to the  BanquetingHouse  and made this follow∣ing Speech to them  Gentlemen  I Have sent for you hither to prevent the Mistakes which I find some are ready to make as if I had called you together only to get Mo∣ney from you for other Ends than you would have it employed I do assure you upon the Word of a King that you shall never repent any Trust reposed in Me for the Safety of My King∣doms and desire you to believe that I would  not break my Credit with you But as I have already told you that it will be impossible for me to speak or act those things which should an∣swer the Ends of your several Addresses with∣out exposing my Kingdoms to much greater Dan∣gers so I declare to you that I will not ha∣zard my own Safety nor yours till I am in better Condition than I am able to put my self both to defend my Subjects and to offend my Enemies And I do farther assure you that I have not lost one Day since your last Meeting in doing all I can for our Defence And I tell you plainly it shall be your Fault and not mine if our Securities be not provided for  May  the st the Address of the House of Commons was read and agreed to and the PrivyCounsellours of the House were ordered to know his Majesty's Pleasure when the House should wait upon him with it The th of  May  they attended the King in the  BanquetingHouse  with their Address The King told them it was of great Weight that he would take it into Consideration and return them an Answer The th of  May  he sent for the House of Com∣mons into the  BanquetingHouse  at  Whitehall  and gave them this following Answer That he could by no means approve of their last Ad∣dress for that it contained many things unfit for them to meddle with and which intrenched upon the undoubted Right of the Crown whose Prerogative it was to make Peace and declare War That his Majesty would never suffer to  be lessened so essential a Part of the Monarchy But withal his Majesty declared that as he had done all that lay in his Power so he would continue to apply himself by all the Means he could to let the World see his Care both for the Security and Satisfaction of his People tho' it might not be with those Advantages to them which by their Assistance he might have procured  But I must not forget to tell that in this Year the House of Commons agreed up∣on an Address to his Majesty to return him their humble Thanks for expressing his great Care of the Protestant Religion in marrying his Niece to a Protestant Prince and did humbly beseech his Majesty to admit of no Treaty of Peace but such a one as leaves the  French  King in no better State or Condition to offend his Neighbours than he is left by the Treaty of the  Pyrrbeneans  In  April  the two Houses of Parliament met and the King being in his Robes in the Lords House sent for the House of Commons to confirm their new Speaker Sir  Robert Sawyer  after which the Lord Chief Justice  North  the Lord Chancellor being indisposed acquainted the two Houses That his Majesty hoped he should have been able at their Meeting to have told something to their full Satisfaction but that things were not yet in that Condition by reason the  Dutch  Ambassador was not fully au∣thorized to treat an Alliance which might com∣prehend all the Allies and particularly to en∣gage  that the States General should in like manner as is done in  England  prohibite all Trade with  France  and therefore his Majesty had thought fit that they should adjourn for some short time longer when his Majesty hoped he should be able to tell them the Certainty of things upon which they might take the Reso∣lutions that were fit Upon which both Hou∣ses of Parliament adjourned themselves  About this time I received a Letter from Sir  Joseph Williamson  in these Words  Dear Sir  WE bear nothing yet of the great Business of our  East India  Company so long since promised which is not yet ended nor like to be the Commissioners can come to no Agreement in their Differences each Company being obsti∣nate in their Demands All that is like to be done is this to leave Matters in the same State they were before the Negotiation and a Rule is made for the amicable Decision of all Complaints which is this that follows If Justice be not done or Satisfaction given to the Parties by the King of  Great Britain  or the  States General  respectively in Three Months then within Three Months after Four Commissioners shall be named on each Side who shall be obliged to determine it in Three Months following their Assembly and if they do not they shall name an Arbitra∣tor to decide within Six Months And if he do not and the Commissioners cannot agree upon such an Arbitrator then the Cause to devolve  upon the King of  Great Britain  and the  States  to decide and this to be the Method Upon each Complaint the Commissioners in the first Case to meet at  London  and in the second at the  Hague  and so alternatively and an Act is passed between the King and the  States  That the th Article of the Treaty at  London  which relates to this Matter of the  East Indies  and the Treaty Marine be executed and no farther Proceedings to be had upon it Upon which the Deputies of the  East India  Company are parted as likewise the Commissioners for  Surinam  the States of  Zealand  having some Weeks past sent their Orders directly to  Surinam  for executing that Part of the Treaty and bringing off the  English  from thence  Soon after this I received a Letter from the Earl of  Sunderland  in these Words fol∣lowing  SIR  HIS Majesty having been pleased to make Choice of me for one of his principal Se∣cretaries of State in Place of Sir  Joseph Wil∣liamson  I hold my self obliged to give you this Notice assuring you at the same time that I shall be very glad of any Occasion that I may lay hold upon during my Function that may offer for your Service as being Sir  Your most Humble Servant  SUNDERLAND  This was in the Year that Sir  Joseph Williamson  resigned and the Earl of  Sunder∣land  came in his Place  The d of  April  all People were impatiently expecting what Resolution would be taken in  Holland  upon the Proposals of the  French  Ambassadors which it seems the States were inclined to accept at a Time when his Majesty was so vigorously preparing for the War and was so near engaging in it that it was believed by the latter End of the next Month his Royal Highness would be in  Flan∣ders  with the whole Army if no extraordinary Accident hinder'd it  But on the th of  May  after a long Debate the Commons came to this Resolution First to disapprove of the offensive Treaty with  Holland  as not consisting with the Safety of the Kingdom Secondly that his Majesty will please to enter into an Alliance with the Em∣peror  Spain  and the States General if they will come into it if not to proceed without them and other the Confederates for lessening the Power of  France  This Address was drawn and presented that Night and the next Day which was the th Instant his Majesty retur∣ned this following Answer  CHARLES REX  HIS Majesty having been acquainted with the Votes of the House of Commons was very much surprized both with the Matter and Form of them But if his Majesty had had  Exception to neither yet his Majesty having asked the Advice of his two Houses of Parlia∣ment does not think fit to give an Answer to any thing of that Nature till he hath a concur∣rent Advice from both Houses  Given at the Court at  Whitehall  the th of  May    The th of  May  his Majesty sent a Message to the House of Commons to let them know that unless they did farther supply his Majesty he should be forced to disband all his Forces and to cease his Preparations for Sea and in the Afternoon of that Day the House of Com∣mons presented their Address to which the King was pleased to answer the next Day That their Address was so extravagant that his Ma∣jesty did not think fit to give it the Answer it deserved and the next Day the King prorogued the Parliament to the d of  May  The st of  May  the House of Commons ordered the Members of the Privy Council to pray his Majesty that if he will please to enter into a War against the  French  King they would sup∣port him in it if otherwise they would pro∣ceed to provide for paying and disbanding the Army To which his Majesty was pleased the next Day to answer That the  French  King had consented to a Cessation to the th of  July  which his Majesty believed would be followed by a general Peace but that the King thought it necessary to keep up his Army till that time and therefore called upon them forthwith to provide a Subsistence for them Whereupon the  House resolved that all the Forces raised since the th of  September  last be forthwith paid and disbanded except those Forces that were sent to the Plantations and they resolved That a Supply be granted to his Majesty towards the paying and disbanding the Forces that have been raised since the said th of  September  In  November  several Persons were ap∣prehended for High Treason and were exa∣mined before the Lords of the Privy Council and committed to  Newgate  in order to their Tryal and all that were or suspected to be  Roman  Catholicks were seized upon and the House of Commons passed this following Vote That upon the Evidence that had already ap∣peared to them there is and hath been a damnable hellish Plot contrived and carried on by the Popish Recusants for assassinating and murdering the King and for subverting the Government and destroying the Protestant Religion by Law established and ordered that this Vote be communicated to the Lords at a Conference and that the Lords be then desired to join with the House of Commons in providing Remedies for the Safety of his Ma∣jesty's sacred Person and Government and Protestant Religion by Law established His Majesty was then pleased to issue out his Pro∣clamation requiring all Popish Recusants not to go five Miles from the Places of their Abode and command all of them to quit the City of  London  without Exception of any Person but only foreign Ministers and his Majesty  sent an Answer in Writing by one of his prin∣cipal Secretaries to the Address for tendering the Oaths to all Persons residing in  Whitehall St James  's and  SomersetHouse  except the menial Servants of the Queen and Dutchess who are excepted by Articles of Marriage  Upon the th of  August  the King was taken at  Windsor  with an Indisposition something like an Ague occasioned by a Cold which made him very heavy and took away his Stomach The News thereof being brought to the Duke at  Brussels  his Royal Highness sent for me at Ten at Night and then he ac∣quainted me with his Intention of going early the next Morning for  England  and commanded me to make his Excuse to the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  for not taking Leave of his Excel∣lency his going being so sudden private and unexpected The th of  September  following I had Letters from  England  that the Duke of  York  was safely arrived at  Windsor  and was most kindly received by the King and all the Court That many Persons flocked thither to see the Duke and kiss his Hands and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of  London  were resolved to come in a Body to pay their Respects to his Royal Highness  About this time Mr Secretary  Coventry  wrote me Word That he had received an Express from  Spain  which he had long expected That he did believe that Court would not be so quick in declaring a Rupture as some of their Mini∣sters in  England  had been in both threatning  and advising it That I might assure the  Count de Fuentes  that our Master was never wanting in the courteous receiving any publick Mini∣ster much less one of his Character and sent from so great a King whilst they performed their Respects to him But when those that are sent to him make their Addresses elsewhere and in a Fashion derogatory to his Government he will let them and the World know that  Eng∣land  is a Monarchy and he the Monarch and that no Addresses in his Kingdom must be made but to him or by his Approbation That his Majesty had had from several Hands a very good Character of the Count and his Temper and hoped when he came he would bring Or∣ders proportionable to such a Temper That the King and Duke had declared their Consent to the Marriage of the Lady  Mary  with the Prince of  Orange  which employed the Jollity of the Town that Night which was all at prefent from  c  Sir  George Wakeman  was about this time tryed for High Treason  Oates Bedlow Dug∣dale  and  Prance  were Witnesses against him  Oates  deposed That Sir  George Wakeman  had to his Knowledge accepted of Fifteen Thou∣sand Pounds to poyson the King and had re∣ceived Five Thousand Pounds of it  Bedlow  deposed That meeting Sir  George Wakeman  at  Harcourt  's Chamber he had acquainted him with his Design of poysoning the King But Sir  Philip Lloyd  Clerk of the Privy Council deposed That  Oates  before the Council being  asked upon the first Discovery of the Plot whether he could say any thing of his own Knowledge of Sir  George Wakeman  he answe∣red God forbid for he knew nothing of his own Knowledge but he had heard Sir  George Wakeman  was to poyson the King To this  Oates  answered That at the Council he was much disturbed and his Memory was by that disor∣dered And  Bedlow  being asked by the Jury whether he had seen Sir  George Wakeman  be∣fore he met him at  Harcourt  's Chamber he answered No Whereupon the Jury reflected that Sir  George Wakeman  must needs be very indiscreet to intrust him with so great a Secret and so Sir  George Wakeman  with three other Prisoners  Marshal Corker  and a LayBrother were all absolved after one Hour's Consultation  Dugdale  and  Prance  being the other Witnesses spake only as to the Plot in general so that Sir  George Wakeman  was acquitted upon very good Reason the Tryal having lasted from Eight in the Morning till Six at Night But the common People would have all Papists hanged without more ado and were much en∣raged against both Jury and Judges and swore they were all turned Papists  On the th of  July  the Privy Coun∣cil ordered a Proclamation should be drawn up for a new Parliament to meet the th of  Octo∣ber  but the King ordered in Council at  Ham∣pton Court  that the Parliament should not meet till the th of  October  the King intending to go to  Newmarket  some time in that Month and  would after return to attend the Business in Parliament without Intermission but this Par∣liament was afterwards prorogued from the th of  October  to the th of  April  In the mean time there came out every Day such Swarms of impudent licentious Libels upon all Sorts of Persons and upon all Subjects printed as the like was never known and will be still conti∣nued whilst the  Habeas Corpus  is still in Force and that they are sure to be bailed  The King having written to the University of  Cambridge  to let them know how much he was displeased with the undutiful Carriage of the Duke of  Monmouth  they did presently chuse a new Chancellor On the st of  April  the King being in his Robes in the House of Lords and the Commons attending with their Speaker his Majesty made this following Speech to them  My Lords and Gentlemen  I Thought it necessary to acquaint you what I have done this Day which is that I have established a new PrivyCouncil the constant Number of which shall not exceed Thirty I have made Choice of such Persons as are worthy and able to advise me And I am resolved in all my weighty and important Affairs next to the Advice of my great Council in Parliament with which I shall very often consult to be advised by this Council I would not make so great a Change without acquainting both Houses of Par∣liament And I desire you will all apply your selves  heartily as I shall do to those things that are necessary for the Safety of the Kingdom and that no Time may be lost in it The constant Number of the Council is to be Thirty amongst which the Princes of the Blood the President and Secre∣tary of  Scotland  are not reckoned because it may happen there may be none of the first nor se∣cond and the  Scotch  Secretary will not be con∣stantly there  His Majesty then told both Houses that he would hold no more Cabinet Councils A De∣claration from the King is expected upon this Change which it is believed was hatched at a Meeting of the Privy Council the Night be∣fore which was so private that the Clerks of the Council attending were ordered to with∣draw which is not usual and this Change did not meet with that general Approbation of the House of Commons as a Condescension of that Nature seemed to challenge as we may perceive by deferring the Consideration of giving his Ma∣jesty Thanks for his Speech which in good Manners they ought to have done immediately  The Day before the King declared this great Change of his Council the House of Commons came to this Resolution That it was their Opi∣nion that the Duke of  York  being a Papist and the Hopes of his coming such to the Crown had given the greatest Countenance and Encou∣ragement to the present Conspiracy of the Pa∣pists against his Majesty and the Protestant Re∣ligion and this Resolution was sent up to the  Lords for their Concurrence by the Lord  Russel  The House of Commons made likewise an Address to his Majesty in the  BanquetingHouse  That  Pickering  and the other Popish Priests con∣demned might be speedily executed To which his Majesty answered That he was very tender of Blood but would send them an Answer to their Address very speedily The Commons then voted That a Bill should be brought in for disabling the Duke of York to inherit the imperial Crown of  England  and that they would stand by the King with their Lives and Fortunes and that if the King which God forbid should be taken away by any sudden Accident they would revenge him to the ut∣most upon all the Papists in  England  The Tryal of the Lords in the  Tower  was deferred for some time and a Committee of both Houses met to adjust the Preliminaries The Lords have at last come to Resolution that the Lords Spiritual have a right to stay in Court in all capital Causes till such time as Judgment of Death comes to be pronounced which they have declared and explained to be till the House proceeds to the Votes of Guilty or Not Guilty The Commons were not at all con∣tented with this Declaration of the Lords nor with their Lordships having appointed the Tryal of the Popish Lords in the  Tower  be∣fore the Earl of  Danby  came to his Tryal  The th of  July  the Council ordered a Proclamation should be drawn up for a new Parliament but his Majesty finding that the  two Houses could not agree about the Tryal of the Lords and that they grew to excessive Heats was pleased to prorogue them till the th of  August  and the next Day he sent for the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Council and gave them Orders to appease all groundless Jealousies which some Men endeavou∣red to raise in People's Minds and the Justices of the Peace in  Middlesex  had the like Orders given them in Council and to proceed to put the Laws in Execution against the Papists And the Lord Chancellor acquainted the Lord Mayor and Aldermen that the King commanded them to put the Laws exactly in Execution against Pa∣pists And because some might pretend to be in Town as Witnesses for the Popish Lords in the  Tower  and others might presume upon the Pro∣roguing of the Parliament to appear which be∣fore they durst not do his Majesty commanded to double their Diligence for finding out all Papists and proceeding to a speedy Conviction of them his Majesty being resolved that they should be proceeded against with greater Seve∣rity than if the Parliament were sitting the King being absolutely resolved to clear the City of Papists And a farther Mark of the King's Zeal in these Proceedings was that he comman∣ded the several Priests who had been condemned should be executed forthwith according to the Sentence passed upon them So much did his Majesty's Proceedings differ now from the Opi∣nion he had at  Cologne  which was never to put the Penal Laws in Execution  It seems the Lords and Commons could not come to any Agreement about the Try∣als of the Lords in the  Tower  The Com∣mons resolved to have the Earl of  Danby  come first and to exclude the Bishops from sitting ill the Court so that the King was necessitated to a Prorogation to abate their Heats and there was an Expedient intended to be proposed in the Earl of  Danby  's Case which was That he should be perpetually banished and degraded to see how that would take But the Earl's Consent being asked to the Proposition he po∣sitively refused it and said he would stand or fall by his Pardon and nothing else  The Heats which appeared upon proroguing the Parliament in  June  were much aba∣ted and People's Thoughts somewhat quieted by what the King had pleased to do since first by giving strict Orders to the Lord Mayor and Justices of the Peace of  Westminster  to put the Laws in Execution against the Papists and di∣recting Mr Attorney General to bring those that were Prisoners for the Plot to a speedy Tryal in commanding the Execution of the condemned Priests and in ordering an Account to be made in every County of those Persons that are fitting to be Justices of Peace and in declaring the Duke of  York  should not return during the Prorogation  There was a warm Report about this time that the Earl of  Shaftsbury  was to leave the Council and the Lord  Roberts  to be made Lord President in his Place The Occasion of this  Report was that the Lord  Roberts  was a great Assertor of the Rights of the Lords and the Bishops when the Earl of  Shaftsbury  was of a contrary Opinion It seems the House of Com∣mons continued very eager upon the Search of such Persons as had in the last Parliament re∣ceived any Money which was put upon the Account of secret Service and having gotten a List of many Names they examined Sir  Ste∣phen Fox  the PayMaster General if he had not payed Money to such as they named He confessed that he had payed several Sums and named the Persons to whom he had payed Mo∣ney for secret Service but the Commons being not content with his verbal Confession they would see his Books of Accompts and sent a Committee of the House to  Whitehall  to fetch the Books but the Lord Chamberlain told the Committee that by virtue of his Office he could not suffer any Search to be made in the King's House without his Majesty's Leave and so the Committee went away without them but Mr  Bertie  was kept in Custody for not de∣livering his Books of the Treasury  In  August  Sir  Lionel Jenkins  landed at  Greenwich  and went directly to  Windsor  to kiss the King's Hands and was very well re∣ceived of his Majesty The Duke's Arrival at  Windsor  from  Brussels  incognito was a great Surprize to them His Royal Highness was most kindly received by the King but it was not determined whether he should continue in  Eng∣land  or return to  Brussels  Great Numbers  of People of all Qualities did daily come to Court to kiss the Duke's Hands which makes the World believe his Presence is very accepta∣ble About this time the Duke of  Monmouth  laid down his Commission of being General and was by his Majesty's Command to leave  England  in few Days and the Duke of  York  is likewise to return to  Brussels  He is at pre∣sent lodged in  Whitehall  and will go with his Majesty to  Newmarket  to which Place he is resolved to go tho' his Physicians advise the contrary It is said the Duke of  Monmouth  is often in Discourse with the King not having a Mind to leave  England  and is passing his Par∣don under the Great Seal before he goes the King being resolved upon his going When the King and Queen go to  Newmarket  the Duke of  York  returns towards  Brussels  and the Duke of  Monmouth  goes for  Holland  intending to reside at  Utrecht  Prince  Rupert  having lent him his House at  Rhenen  The Dutchess does not accompany the Duke the King having disswaded her from it  I was about this time informed from  Whitehall  that the th of  October  drawing on when the Parliament was to meet I should have News from thence but they could not promise me it should be good at the same time and from the same Hand I was told that the Lord Chief Justice being in his Circuit and giving his Charge to the Grand Jury amongst other things recommended unto them the strict executing the Laws against Papists Whereupon the Duke of  Buckingham  who was in the Court upon the Bench stood up and said  It was well indeed if that were done but that the Lord Chief Justice when he gave that Charge did not mean it should be obser∣ved because he was a Favourer of the Papists and that he  the Duke  knew he had private Or∣ders to assist and favour the Papist all he could  Which last is a Reflection upon the King pu∣nishable by the Law which declares it Trea∣son to say the King is a Papist It is added to me in my Letter from a very good Hand that the Duke did hereupon abscond and that the Chief Justice before he gave out his Warrant complained to the King and had the King's Directions in it and I have been since told that the Duke of  Buckingham  was gone pri∣vately into  Holland  and was there seen by them that well knew his Grace  The Parliament was prorogued this Day for Fourteen Days longer his Majesty having de∣clared to the Council that he was desirous to spend some more Days at  Newmarket  finding that Air very agreeable to him and that after his Return he had several Matters to prepare for the Parliament which he thought would not be unpleasing to them which would not be ready against the Time it was at first inten∣ded they should be The Yacht that carried his Royal Highness to  Brussels  did bring back the Lady  Anne  and the Lady  Isabella  to  London  with the Dutchess of  York  On the th of  October  Mr Secretary  Coven∣try  communicated a Letter to those in his Of∣fice  which he had then received from  New∣market  by the King's Command that the Duke of  York  before his Return to  Brussels  had de∣sired he might live in the Dominions of his Majesty rather than in those of any other Prince and having asked the King's Leave to go to  Scotland  the King had granted it and ac∣cordingly had ordered two Frigates to be ready in the  Downes  to transport his Royal Highness and the Duke of  Lauderdale  was dispatched to  Scotland  to make Preparations for his Royal Highness's Reception which was hindered for some time by the unlucky Accident which happened at Sea However the th of  Octo∣ber  both their Royal Highnesses arrived at Court and were very well received by all that End of the Town but I know not whether I can say so much for the other Their Stay will be short being designed for  Scotland  where by his Majesty's Leave they intend to reside  The th of  October  the Parliament met and were prorogued to the th of  Janu∣ary  and at the same time one of the princi∣pal Secretaries of State by his Letter to the Earl of  Shaftsbury  let his Lordship know by the King's Command that his Majesty intended to make no more Use of his Lordship at the Council Table and not only excused his Lord∣ship for attending as President of the Council but discharged him from his farther Attendance there and the th of the same Month his Majesty ordered the Earl of  Radnor  to take the Place of Lord President of the Council  Table in the Place of the Earl of  Shaftsbury  which the Earl of  Radnor  did accordingly Mr  Oates  's Complaint against Sir  Philip Lloyd  one of the Clerks of the Council was heard and it being proved that Sir  Philip  had in a Coffeehouse spoken some Words as if he did not believe the Plot and besides spoke in∣discreetly at the Tryal of Sir  George Wakeman  the King as a Mark of his Displeasure suspen∣ded him the Execution of his Place Then the Matter against Sir  Thomas Williams  the Chymist was heard and it appearing that of his own Head he had gone with pretended Messages between the Duke and Mr  Oates  which he then denied as well as some Words which were proved he had said to Mr  Oates  viz  That he knew enough to ruine the Duke and all his Party  he was by Order of the Council committed to the  GateHouse  It seems Mr  Oates  was at  Oxford  and would have had the same Degree of Doctor as he pre∣tended to have had at  Salamanca  but they re∣fused him  We are told their Royal Hignesses in their Passage for  Scotland  stayed some Days at  York  to rest themselves before they went into  Scot∣land  and that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen did not shew that Respect to them which they expected of which the King being informed and that their Behaviour differed much from what it did before at the Duke's former Passage there his Majesty was thereupon much displea∣sed the which he signified to the Lord Mayor  and Aldermen of that City letting them know that his Majesty expects whenever the Duke passes that Way again that they treat him in the same Manner as they did formerly and that they shew him that Respect which becomes all good Subjects to shew to the King's Brother The  Scots  seem greatly pleased at the Duke's Coming and that they shall have a Court kept amongst them  November  the d I am told they are again at  London  launched into the Business of the Plot one  Dangerfield  having been several Days before the Council in Examination but People are not very hasty to give Credit to his Relation who hath been once if not oftener in the Pillory and is now in  Newgate  A Proclamation is in the Press and will sud∣denly issue out for giving Notice that who∣ever knows any thing of the Plot and does not discover it before the End of next  February  he is to expect the Penalty of the Law for Misprision of Treason and is not to have any Benefit of Pardon About this time there was another new Discoverer of the Plot upon the King's Life come in He was a Servant to Sir  Thomas Gascoign  a  Yorkshire  Gentleman of a great Estate and great Age However he is sent for to  Whitehall  by a Messenger These several Discoverers will I hope let us see the Bottom or at least the End once of this Matter I am informed from a good Hand at  Whitehall  of a warm Report spread abroad that the Earl of  Essex  First Commissioner of the Treasury  and his Brother Sir  Henry Capel  First Com∣missioner of the Admiralty are both withdraw∣ing themselves from the Court and Council tho' there be no Reason yet known for it the King not having shewed any Disfavour to either of them The Humour is much changed when such Men quit their Places without any visible Reasons and therefore we may well think the King will be as willing to accept as they are to resign  I had Letters from  Whitehall  of the th of  November  which said the Duke of  Monmouth  came to Town unlook'd for that so soon as his Coming was known the People made Bon∣fires shot off Guns and rung their Bells He offered to see the King but his Majesty not only refused him because he returned without his Orders but forbad him the Court and or∣dered him to return within Twenty Four Hours when Preparations were making of new Bon∣fires which were suppressed and yet the Duke continued still in Town the th of  December  but stript of all Employments and no great Talk of him  An Address hath been made to the King by Eight Lords for the Meeting of the Parlia∣ment at the Time appointed and the same has been done by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to the King in Council where after the Lord Chancellor had done the King spoke himself and told the Lord Mayor and Aldermen with great Earnestness That he could not endure any longer those factious Doings and expected the City of  London  should be an Example to  the whole Kingdom  c  A Proclamation was then ordered to be printed and published to forewarn all People from signing such Petitions shewing the Danger they will run themselves into by so doing  The th of  October  the Justices of  Middlesex  and  Westminster  were called before the Privy Council and were strictly charged to put the Laws in Execution against the Papists and that they should meet and consult of such Expedients as they should think most effectual and return the same to the Board and a Com∣mittee of the Council were appointed Com∣missioners to receive and consider of such Pro∣positions and to propose such other Expedients as should occur to them Hereupon the Justi∣ces of Peace of  Middlesex  and  Westminster  did make their Report to the Council of the seve∣ral Expedients which they had agreed to amongst themselves for the better executing the Laws against Papists which the Privy Council ap∣proved of It seems notwithstanding the Pro∣clamation some seditious People would fain bring on the Petitions as well about the Court as in  Essex  and tho' they are not considerable enough to bring the Matter to any Head yet it may give Encouragement to others if it be not punished And upon Information of this the Privy Council have sent for Three or Four of the principal Persons ingaged herein and the great Expectation is to see how they will proceed against them And it is suspected that the City of  London  with some of the Coun∣ties  adjoining have not quite laid aside their Design of Petitioning his Majesty for a Parlia∣ment notwithstanding there is small Appea∣rance it will be to any Effect In the mean time the Privy Council have taken several Re∣solutions concerning the vigorous Prosecution of the Papists which will be executed without any Connivance or Partiality and the particu∣lar Method that will be taken is set down in a Proclamation that is now in the Press for that Purpose We are told from  Scotland  that the Duke has taken his Place in the Privy Council of  Scotland  and as First Prince of the Blood was dispensed with as to taking the Oaths which is likewise the Practice in  England  For at the forming the present Privy Council all the Lords were sworn except Prince  Rupert  who being a Prince of the Blood he was not sworn  In  June  I received this ensuing Let∣ter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  SIR  I Am infinitely obliged to you for your constant Correspondence Last Night a Defensive Alliance between his Majesty and the King of  Spain  was signed It is the same in Effect with that made in between  Spain  and  Holland  and that in between his Majesty and  Hol∣land  It is his Majesty's Instruction to all his Ministers abroad not to make any Flourish or Noise on our Part of this League but only to own and avow upon all Occasions that shall be given by the Enquiries of other Men that there  is such a League newly made that it is such a one that can give no Offence or Umbrage to any Neighbour Prince it being purely defensive and inducing no Obligation but that the two Kings defend each other in their present Peace and Possessions against any that shall aggress or in∣vade them I am Sir  Your most Humble Servant  L JENKINS  Some time after this the Earl of  Danby  peti∣tioned the King and House of Lords that he might be tryed but nothing being done in it his Lordship petitioned farther that he might be bailed and his Case was argued by Mr  Polexton Wallop  and  Holt  and likewise by my Lord him∣self The Substance of what was said is reducible to Four Heads First The King's Prerogative Secondly The Liberty of the Subject Thirdly The Privilege of Parliament And Fourthly The Jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench  First It was urged That by bailing of my Lord the King's Prerogative would be main∣tained which would otherwise suffer by his longer Confinement For that he produced the King's Pardon as a great Motive to incline the Court to bail him Besides that Mr Attorney had declared the King's particular Inclination to consent to it and the King having Power to pardon a Person impeached which Mr  Polex∣ton  said no Man of the Robe ought to question tho' the Impeachment be not at his Suit it was hoped the Court would take so much Notice of  these Intimations of his Majesty's Justice as to let my Lord out upon Bail whereby they would assert the King's true Power and just Prerogative it being hard that there shall not be a Power of Bailing where there is a Power of Pardoning  Secondly The Liberty of the Subject will be preserved by it for if there be no Remedy for any Person impeached but that he must lye by it till he be enlarged by the same Power that committed him it would follow that during the Recesses of Parliament a Failure of Justice would arise which will be a heavy Blow to that natural Freedom to which the Sub∣jects of  England  by Birthright are intituled and such a Punishment as is not only a Con∣demnation but may prove even an Execution before Tryal For probably my Lord being oppressed with the Inconvenience of the Place and with his own Infirmities may die in the Jayl before his Enlargement by his Peers and the Stain of his Impeachment dwell upon his Memory and his Posterity for ever For the Prevention of which lamentable Case and for Preservation of that due Liberty which the King's Subjects ought to have it was conceived that my Lord ought to be bailed  Thirdly The Privileges of Parliament would not hereby be infringed for to bail a Man being committed by a superior Court is not to assume a Jurisdiction of his Cause or any way to claim a Cognizance of it which it was granted the Court of King's Bench in Cases of  Impeachment ought not to do but it was on∣ly an enlarging of his Prison or as Mr  Wal∣lop  said a lengthening of his Chain instead of his remaining  in arcta custodia  for so is every Man let out upon good Bail presumed to be and the Law looks upon his Forthcoming to be as secure as if he were under close Confinement So that such a Proceeding as this is not to in∣trench or to encroach upon the Privileges of Parliament but only to avoid a great Evil a Failure of Justice  Fourthly By bailing my Lord of  Danby  the Court would assert their own Jurisdiction it being conceived that the Court of King's Bench have always intermeddled with Circum∣stances and mediate Acts relating to things done in Parliament thereafter as the Necessity of the Case required tho' not with the very things themselves and to that Purpose several Prece∣dents were cited as one of  Okey  and two other Traitors who were attainted in Parliament and before Execution awarded there happened a Pro∣rogation Whereupon the Record of their Con∣viction was removed into the King's Bench and the Prisoners brought to the Bar and having nothing to say why Execution should not be awarded against them were accordingly exe∣cuted This was the Sum of what was said by all those that argued The Court was divided whether they should give their Opinion pre∣sently or take Time but they resolved to con∣sider till the next Term and my Lord was again remanded to Prison  Upon this Occasion I have thought fit to give a Copy of the Lord Chief Justice  Pember∣ton  's Charge upon summing up the Evidence upon the Tryal of  Fitzharris  in  London  THE Prisoner at the Bar Gentlemen of of the Jury is charged with Treason for Libelling the Government and setting others to do it Whether  Fitzharris  be the Author of this Libel or not is the Question The Evi∣dence against him is very great Mr  Everard  declares to you the whole Design and Discourse with him he tells you the Manner and gives you the very Grounds on which the Libel was to be written It was to raise Sedition to make an Insurrection and to stir up People to rebel Mr  Eve∣rard  was so cautious that he walked not alone in this Case but with much Prudence declared it to others that they might be Witnesses with him and Mr  Smith  agrees with him in all things How he heard  Fitzharris  give the Directions for ma∣king this Libel heard the Design of it and the Reward promised for the doing it which was the first Night The next Night Sir  William Waller  was present and says  Fitzharris  gave the same Instructions and owned them and what is not to be answered they are all under his own Hand which Directions are Treason enough and is as strong an Evidence against him as perhaps ever was and I think a plainer Evidence cannot be given than that  Fitzharris  is the Author of this Libel The Witnesses he brings for himself are Mr  Oates  and Mr  Cor∣nish  The First says That Mr  Everard  told him this was a Design and that it should be put in∣to the Pockets of some Lords and Members of Parliament and that they should be apprehen∣ded and questioned for the Libel But Mr  Eve∣rard  upon his Oath testifies he never said any such thing Then Mr  Cornish  says That ha∣ving some Discourse with his Majesty concerning Mr  Fitzharris  the King said he was an ill Man and had some Money from him for some Service he promised to do him but it can never be thought that the King would give Money to stir up his Sub∣jects against him or to hazard all that is near and dear to him And if you believe  Fitzharris  's own Handwriting or any Evidence that can be given 'tis a plain Case that he is Guilty And for saying he would charge you with his Blood because he is impeached by the Commons that's nothing at all to the Matter nor are you to have any Consideration whether we have Power to try him or not that is a Question already de∣termined There lyes no more before you who are the Jury but only to consider whether Guilty or Not Guilty And as to the Vote of the Commons that can no more alter the Laws of the Land than a Letter to us from the King of which we are not to take Notice being upon our Oaths to do Justice and see if he be Guilty or not If he be Guilty you can no more spare him than condemn an innocent Man The Vote of the House of Commons can neither excuse us nor you We are to try Matters of Law and you the Matter of Fact But you Mr  Johnson  who are the Foreman of the Jury to give you all manner of Satisfaction this Doubt was mo∣ved to my Brother  Jones  when he gave the Charge to the Grand Jury upon which all the Judges of  England  met and they all agreed we might try him And this was done to re∣move all manner of Scruple that might arise  Some few Days after this Sheriff  Bethel  having received a Warrant for the Execution of Mr  Oliver Plunket  and Mr  Fitzharris  the First was put upon a Sledge at  Newgate  and delivered to the Sheriff who carried him with a strong Guard to the Place of Execution and where he spoke as follows  TO the final Satisfaction of all Persons who have the Charity to believe the Words of a dying Man I declare before God and as I hope for Salvation that what I have said and what is contained in a Paper signed with my own Hand is the plain and naked Truth with∣out any Equivocation mental Reservation or any secret Evasion whatsoever taking the Words in their usual Sense and Meaning as Protestants do when they discourse with all Candor and Sincerity  Having made this Protestation and prayed he was tyed up and afterwards quartered and his Bowels burnt Captain  Richardson  Keeper of  Newgate  being asked by the Lieutenant of the  Tower  how his Prisoner had behaved him∣self  he replied  Very well For when I came to him this Morning he was newly awake having slept all Night without any Disturbance and when I told him he was to prepare for his Ex∣ecution he received the Message with all Quiet∣ness of Mind and went to the Sledge as uncon∣cerned as if he had been going to a Wedding  The same Day after this Execution the Sheriff went to the  Tower  and at the Barriers on  TowerHill  Mr  Fitzharris  was delivered to him whom he carried with a strong Guard thro' the City to the Place of Execution and being asked by the Sheriff of what Religion he died he replied  A Protestant  and being urged to make a Confession he said  Good People  I Am come hither to die an ignominious Death the Manner of which troubles me more than Death it self The Crimes for which I am accu∣sed and condemned I am guiltless of and what Sir  William Waller  and Mr  Smith  swore against me is false All that I have to say more is con∣tained in this Paper  Which he gave to Mr  Hawkins  the Minister who after the Execution gave the Sheriff a Copy of it the Original being sent to the King at  Windsor  The Duke of  Monmouth  having lately passed up and down the Kingdom in a Manner that gave much Offence to his Majesty and having been at  WestChester  where the Mayor being a  Fanatick and his Wife Neice to the late  Brad∣shaw  the Great Traitor his Grace was very well received by them but at  Litchfield Coventry  and other Places neither the Magi∣strates nor Gentry took much Notice of him However by the King's Command a Sergeant at Arms was sent down to  Stafford  to bring him up and being brought to one of the Secreta∣ries of State after Examination of him he committed him by a second Warrant to the Custody of the Sergeant at Arms which War∣rant charged his Grace to have passed thro' se∣veral Parts of the Kingdom with great Num∣bers of People in a riotous Manner to the Disturbance of the Publick Peace and to the Terror of the King's good Subjects who was to keep him in Custody till he should give Security to appear at the King's Bench the First Day of the next Term to answer to such Information as should be brought against him on the King's Behalf and that in the mean time he should be of good Behaviour And the First Day of the Term the Duke of  Monmouth  was upon his  Habeas Corpus  brought before Judge  Raymond  where he gave the desired Se∣curity the Earl of  Clare  the Lord  Russel  Lord  Grey  Mr  Gower  and Mr  Offeley  being his Bail The Duke was bound in Ten Thou∣sand Pounds and the Bail each in Two Thou∣sand Pounds The Behaviour of the Duke gives the King every Day more Offence and particu∣larly his having accosted the Earl of  Hallifax  with very unbecoming Language upon Ac∣count  of something supposed his Lordship had said in Council concerning the Duke of  Mon∣mouth  The King was pleased in Council to declare That he looked upon it as an Insolence offered to himself for any one to question a Privy Counsellour for any thing said in Coun∣cil and did strictly forbid all Persons having any Relation to his Service to have for the future any Communication with the Duke of  Monmouth  who hath been so angry with his Wife for seeing the Dutchess by whom she was very kindly received that the Duke of  Monmouth  will not see his Dutchess  An Action of  Scandalum Magnatum  in Be∣half of the Duke was brought against Mr  Pil∣kington  for Words spoken by him when his Royal Highness dined last in  London  with the  Artillery Company  The Words spoken were these  He hath burnt the City and is now come to cut our Throats Innuendo  the Duke of  York  The Jury were all Gentlemen of Quality of  Hertfordshire  which County Mr  Pilkington  had chosen and they gave his Royal Highness One Hundred Thousand Pounds Damage which will doubtless teach factious Persons who have lived of late with so much Licence in their Discourses to govern their Tongues better  Letters from  Scotland  tell us that Affairs go there according to Wish That the Parlia∣ment there have written a Letter of Thanks to the King for sending the Duke of  York  which we hope will break the Measures of those  who flattered themselves with a Support from that Kingdom which has not been in many Ages more united than it is at present under the prudent Conduct of his Royal Highness Our Letters from thence tell us that the Lords of the Articles had prepared three publick Bills the First for recognizing the Rights of the Crown and the Succession the Second for continuing a Tax for Five Years longer for Maintainance of the standing Forces The Third a Bill for establishing the Protestant Religion which passed very chearfully in the Articles and Duke  Hamilton  concurred in them all The Letters add That the Duke is high∣ly esteemed and beloved of all Sorts of People and that there is a constant and great Court of Lords and Ladies Major  Oglethorp  brings this Account which is very pleasing to all the People in this Court  The Apprentices in  London  presented their Petition to his Majesty with Twelve Thousand Hands to give his Majesty Thanks for his late Declaration It met with a gracious Ac∣ceptance and those that carried it were intro∣duced by the Lord Chamberlain and had the Honour to kiss his Majesty's Hand The King gave them a Brace of Bucks out of  Hyde  Park and they made a great Feast in  London  The Duke of  Albemarle  and many of the Nobility did them the Honour to be present at their Feast which they intend to keep annually and the Duke of  Grafton  and the Earl of  Feversham  have done them the Honour to be their Stew∣ards  for the next Year The Apprentices of  Bristol  in Imitation of those of  London  have subscribed an Address to give the King their most humble Thanks for his gracious Declara∣tion The Nobility and Gentry of  Norfolk  have done the like and the Addresses from all Parts on the same Account come in very fast and one has been presented from the Lieute∣nancy of  London  and from  Southwark  and 'tis wished they may have the good Effect they were intended for  The Lord Mayor of  London  with the Court of Aldermen attended the King at  HamptonCourt  with a Petition from the Common Coun∣cil desiring his Majesty to assemble a Parlia∣ment The Lord Chancellor by the King's Command gave them a very severe Reprimand telling them that the King wondered how they durst bring such a Paper to him in Name of the City when it was against the Sense of the best Part of the City That the King knew there were restless Spirits amongst them and would set a Mark upon them and that if they went on in those Courses he would make them sensible of his Displeasure The th of  July  the Lord Mayor came again to  HamptonCourt  with a Petition of the Common Coun∣cil and the Lord Chancellor gave them an An∣swer much like the last This Morning the Earl of  Shaftsbury  was taken by a Warrant from Sir  Lionel Jenkins  and his Trunks and Papers seized and both he and they were car∣ried before the Council where he was exami∣ned  so privately that all the Clerks of the Council were turned out It is said he was taken upon the Information of Mr  Haynes  Mr  Macknamarra  and  Ivy  who 'tis said corroborate the Testimony  Fitzharris  gave to Mr  Hawkins  amongst whose Papers is found one of Instructions or Directions to  Fitzharris  with several Heads of what he should plead and what he should swear to The Hand is very well known and will be made publick The King was present at this extraordinary Council held at  Whitehall  where the Earl of  Shaftsbury  was brought in Custody of a Ser∣geant at Arms and was told there was a Charge of High Treason against him which would be proved by several Witnesses whereupon he was committed to the  Tower  and that Evening the Duke of  Monmouth  with several Lords went to visit him which occasioned a greater Restraint upon him and he and my Lord  Howard  are both close Prisoners and only their Wives are permitted to come to them  The Proceedings this Session at the  Old Baily  were very remarkable most of the Judges be∣ing there and many Persons of the first Qua∣lity as the Duke of  Monmouth  and several others Mr  Wallop  and Mr  Williams  pleaded hard for the  Habeas Corpus  for the Earl of  Shaftsbury  and the Lord  Howard  But the  Tower  being a Prison out of the City and their Meeting being only a Session of  Oyer  and  Ter∣miner  the  Habeas Corpus  could not lye in that Court A Bill of Indictment was then presen∣ted  to the Grand Jury of the City of  London  against  Colledge  the  Protestant Joyner  as he was always called The Witnesses against him were Mr  Smith  Mr  Dugdale  Mr  Haynes  the two  Macknamara's  and Sir  William Jen∣nings  They all positively swore that  Colledge  told them there was a Design to seize the King at  Oxford  and bring him to  London  and there keep him till he had complied with them or else to bring him to the Block as they did his Father and that in this Design the House of Lords and Commons were concerned and that there was an Army ready at  London  to assist them It is certainly true that never Men swore more firmly than they did in Court be∣fore the Jury who demanded of the Court a Copy of their Oaths and that the Witnesses might go with them to be examined apart which Request was granted to the Jury and after two or three Hours Consideration the Jury returned and found the Bill  Ignoramus  Upon which the Lord Chief Justice demanded whether they would give no Reason for this Verdict and whether they believed those Six Witnesses perjured To which they replied That they had given their Verdict according to their Consciences and that they would stand by it To which the Lord Chief Justice  North  said  There was never such a Verdict brought in the World  The Grand Jury before they were discharged delivered a Petition to the Court desiring the Removal of the Priests and Jesuits farther from the Lords in the  Tower  they  holding Correspondence with them Upon bringing in this Bill  Ignoramus Colledge  will be sent to be tryed in  Oxford  where the Judges arrived the th of  July  Their Commission was opened and the Grand Jury was sworn of which Sir  Thomas Spencer  was Foreman the rest were all Gentlemen of Loyalty and Pro∣testants and of good Estates and upon hearing the Evidence against  Colledge  they found the Indictment  Billa vera nemine contradicente  One of the Evidence against him swore That if the King did not agree with his Parliament there was a Design to seize upon him and Thirty Thousand Men were ready in the City of  London  to back the Design and that if the King refused to pass the Bill of Exclusion they would serve him as they did his Father This  Colledge  was brought to his Tryal at  Oxford  before the Lord Chief Justice  North  and Justice  Jones  The Tryal lasted from Two in the Afternoon till Two in the Morning so much Time was taken up in examining the Wit∣nesses The Evidence against the Prisoner was the same which was at the  OldBaily  those for the Prisoner were chiefly Mr  Oates Mow bray  and  Waldron  who said that  Dug∣dale  and  Smith  told them they knew nothing against  Colledge  but they denied it upon their Oaths and the Jury brought him in Guilty and some Hours after the Prisoner received his Sentence the Court meeting again for that Purpose Some Days after  Colledge  was executed and his Head was set  upon  TempleBar  to be a Warning to others to avoid his Fate  Mr  Sidney  in  Holland  finding that his Maje∣sty was much surprized at his having taken a Commission in  Holland  without his Leave to be General of all the  English  Forces there which hath been vacant since the Death of the Earl of  Ossory  hath been perswaded by his Friends to resign that Employment to the Earl of  Arran  Son to Duke  Hamilton  who is now very well at the Court in  Scotland  and has the King's Leave to accept of the  Scotch  Regiment in  Holland  whereof  Kilpatrick  was Collonel which the Prince of  Orange  has offered him  About this time the Prince of  Orange  came for  England  and was very well received by the King and Court and had been several times in private with the King Various Discourses are raised about his Coming and his Return will be very sudden He hath been something unlucky at Play having lost in one Night Three Thou∣sand Pounds at  Basset  His Highness whilst in  London  lodges at  ArlingtonHouse  where he hath been magnificently entertained at the King's Charge and hath been likewise treated very splendidly by the Duke of  Albemarle  His Highness was also invited to dine with the Lord Mayor of  London  and accepted the Invitation and great Preparations were made for his Re∣ception and as he was preparing to dine in  London  he received an Express from his Ma∣jesty to come presently to  Windsor  which he did and the Secretary of State carried his Ex∣cuse  After this the Lord Mayor sent the two Sheriffs to invite his Highness to dine with him who promised the next Day to dine with his Lordship But the King sent for him again that Day whereupon his Highness sent his own Secretary to excuse it and left the Lord Mayor under a very great Disappointment And not many Hours before he left  Windsor  a Cabinet Council was there held concerning  Flanders  wherein the Prince of  Orange  was present but the Reason of his Coming is still kept very secret which none can tell About this time the Lord Mayor carried up an Address of the Common Hall to the King at  HamptonCourt  and gave it to the King in Council Sir  John Shorter  Sir  Robert Clayton  Mr  Be∣thel  and Mr  Cornish  attended upon his Lord∣ship who having presented the Address to his Majesty he was pleased to return this Answer by the Lord Chancellor  My Lord  YOU have presented the King with a Paper which hath been publickly printed long since and the King doth not believe it is now presented so much for the Satisfaction of his Majesty as to serve for some other End The King knows that the major Part of the City are well inclined to his Service and that it is not in the Power of a few ill Men amongst them to corrupt the rest The King therefore doth not believe this to be so unanimous a Vote of the City as is pretended and he commands me  to tell you that if he did believe it were so as he does not that you have meddled with a thing that is none of your Business  and so dis∣missed them  The Carriage of Mr  Oates  has been such especially at the Tryal of  Colledge  where he was a Witness against the King in things where∣in he was notoriously disproved that his Maje∣sty hath thought fit to take from him the Pensions he gave him as also the Lodging he had at  Whitehall  which was intimated to him with a Command to leave the Court The King hath likewise commanded the Lodgings the Earl of  Mecklesfield  and the Lord  Manchester  had at Court to be taken from them and at the same time the young Lord  Mordaunt  who hath for some time assossciated with the discontented Lords hath made his Peace and waited upon the King  About this time I received a Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  written with his own Hand in these Words following dated the th of  August    SIR  YOurs come so regularly that I cannot suffi∣ciently acknowledge your great Care and punctual Correspondence I send you now two Acts of Parliament from  Scotland  that will not be unwelcome to you A Third is coming out being agreed by the Lords of the Articles whereby the Subsidies to the Militia are conti∣nued  for Five Years longer This Term is to commence when the present Act expires which will be in 'Twill be no Matter of De∣light to you that  Colledge  had Sentence of Death pronounced against him at  Oxford  for High Treason but it will please you to hear the Addresses still go on and that an Address will be presented to his Majesty on  Sunday  from  Northamptonshire  with Ten Thousand Hands I am  c  Yours  L JENKINS  I had another Letter from the same Hand the d of  September    SIR  I Have the Favour of yours to acknowledge I did never understand that the Places which the  French  have now seized into their own Hands were Dependencies of  China  and there∣fore I would fain know upon what Account the  French  have possessed themselves of several other Places that are not so much as pretended to be Dependencies of  China  I take Leave to inclose a List of the publick Acts passed in  Scotland  before the Prorogation which was on the th Instant to the st of  March  His Royal High∣ness hath not only come up to the Full of his Instructions but hath done more for that Crown than hath been done for a very long Time before I am with much Esteem  Your most Humble Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  The Sessions at  Hickes  's  Hall  for the County beginning and Sir  George Jeffries  being Chair∣man he objected against the Persons that were returned to serve on the Grand Jury as being Dissenters from the Church of  England  and required the UnderSheriff to make a new Pan∣nel of substantial good Men which he refu∣sing the Court ordered the Sheriffs themselves should attend the next Day But instead of them the Recorder of  London  appeared and told the Court that the Sheriffs having ac∣quainted the Court of Aldermen with the Or∣der they were of Opinion that the Privilege of the City did exempt the Sheriffs from any Attendance at  Hickes  's  Hall  and that it was sufficient if the UnderSheriff did their Busi∣ness But the Court not allowing the Excuse for their Contempt fined the two Sheriffs One Hundred Pounds and then adjourned and re∣solved to acquaint the Judges with the Matter Mr  Wilson  a Secretary to the Earl of  Shafts∣bury  was seized and committed Prisoner to the  GateHouse  for High Treason in conspiring the Deposing of the King The same Day se∣veral of the  East India  Company waited on the King and presented him with Ten Thousand Guineas The  Heer Van Beuninghen  had then a long Audience of the King and was after∣wards in Conference with the Ministers about the Affairs of  Flanders  The same Day the Recorder of  London  with the two Sheriffs came to  Whitehall  to invite the King to Dinner  on the  Lord Mayor's Day  The King said he would on all Occasions express his Kindness to the City and that he would dine with the Lord Mayor tho' he received the Invitation by very unwelcome Messengers meaning the two She∣riffs I was assured from a very good Hand at  Whitehall  that a Petition was presented to the King in the Name of the Earl of  Shaftsbury  wherein he prayed his Liberty and offered to transport himself and Family to  Carolina  but his Petition was not received or at least not answered I am told that Sir  Peter Wyche  is called home from  Hambourg  and that Mr  Skel∣ton  is to reside there in his Place as the King's Minister to all the Princes in that Quarter The th of  November  I received this ensuing Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  SIR  WE are here in great Pain about  Luxen∣burgh  I take therefore Leave of my own Head to desire you to inform your self the most exactly that you can of the Condition of that City What Charges soever you shall be at I shall most willingly reimburse I desire you to send an Express for we have no good Account of any thing but what we have from you I am Sir with much Esteem  Your most Humble Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  In the Beginning of this Year the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  finished his Government of  Flan∣ders  and was recalled and the  Prince de Par∣ma  was sent in his Place who governed all by  Count d'Arquinto  his First Minister who re∣ceived all Addresses and answered them but had not been long in the Government before the  Marquis de Grana  was sent from  Spain  thro'  England  to be Governour of Arms in  Flan∣ders  and to have the Disposition of the Finan∣ces and Money to which if the  Prince de Parma  did not agree he was then to leave the Government to the  Marquis de Grana  but this Matter was kept very private and the  Marquis  took a private House near the Court The  Prince de Parma  looking upon this as a very extraordinary Proceeding was resolved to leave the Government and using each Evening to take the Air in his Coach he went away pri∣vately to  Liege  from whence he sent back his Coaches and Retinue to  Count d'Arquinto  with Order to pay his Debts And thus the  Prince de Parma  quitted the Government and upon his retiring the  Marquis de Grana  took upon him the absolute Government and immediate∣ly had the King's Palace prepared for him But before the  Prince de Parma  parted I had Letters of Credence to him with a Letter from the King and besides my particular Letters I had a Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  by the King's Command dated the th of  July    SIR  I Am commanded by his Majesty to signify to you that it is his Pleasure you should em∣ploy your best Endeavours to get my Lord of  Castlehaven  satisfied of his Arrears in that Coun∣try his Majesty being graciously pleased to give him what Assistance is usual in that kind This the King commanded me yesterday and withal that I should take my Instructions from my Lord of  Castlehaven  himself His Lordship called upon me this Morning and told me the King having referred him to me his Desire to you was that his Arrears might be paid himself as Serjeant General of Battle and his two Sons as Collonels And that till his Lordship do receive his Arrears both for himself and his two Sons with which Arrears he intends to pay his Debts his Protection may be renewed and prolonged to him This I have in Command from his Maje∣sty whereunto I take Leave to add the Assu∣rance of my being with Esteem Sir  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  Upon this Letter I presented a Memorial to the  Prince de Parma  pursuant punctually to those Directions which I received from Sir  Lio∣nel Jenkins  to which I received this ensuing Answer which is faithfully translated out of  Spanish  into  English  ALthough I could refer my self to what I have represented to his Majesty of  Great Britain  and to what I have told your Seigniory in divers Discourses touching the Interest of the Lord  Castlehaven  yet nevertheless to satisfy the Instances your Seigniory hath made on the Part of the King your Master for the Payment of the Arrears due to his Lordship as  Serjeant Ge∣neral de Battaile  and  Maistre de Camp  I hope your Seigniory will let your Court know that it was not the King of  Spain  but the  Duc de Villa Hermosa  that did give the  English  Regiment to the two Sons of my Lord successively reducing it to two Companies which never had in the whole Fourscore Men And yet the great Esteem I bear to the Arms of the King of  Great Britain  would not permit me to suffer them to be governed by those whose Age made them uncapable Adding to this the Care I took to give Satisfaction to his Lordship which I found impossible for his Incon∣stancy and little Settledness and the Longing he had to quit the Service without Leave the which I winked at in respect of the Character he bore of being a Subject to so great a King and also that much was to be connived at in the Court by such as knew his natural Temper According to what I have been informed in gross by the Notices I have had from the several Offices there is little due to his Lordship yet notwith∣standing I have ordered the Account to be made in particular and so soon as we have Money his Lordship shall be paid what is due to him  For the rest I remit my self to the King my Master what he shall resolve upon touching the Person of his Lordship to whom I have given an Account of all that hath passed Given at the Palace the th of  August    Alexander Farnese  Au Seigneur  Bulstrode  Re∣sident du Roy de la  Grande Brittaine  The th of  October  I received the ensuing Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  SIR  I Have yours regularly and thank you for them with all my Heart What you have written to me in  Count d'Arquinto  's Name hath been humbly laid before the King with your separate Letter upon that Subject and the Hints you have given in your general Letters The whole Matter is at present before his Ma∣jesty and when any Resolution comes to my Knowledge I shall be glad to impart it to you with the soonest My Lord of  Castlehaven  fills the King's Ears and every body's else with his Complaints He desires you would have a Care of his Goods that they be not sold for he will send Money to redeem them speedily as he tells his Majesty I am Sir  c  L JENKINS  The th of  November  following I had this following Letter from the same Hand  SIR  I Have the Favour of your Letters That which contained the Message of the  Prince de Parma  by the  Count d'Arquinto  being Mat∣ter of Haste and Importance I would most gladly have taken his Majesty's Pleasure upon it but I must beg your Respite till after  Sunday  when at the Committee of Foreign Affairs it will be proper to treat of it In the  Interim  I send you the Answer of his Majesty to the  States Ge∣nerals  Minister's Memorial you may see by it the Concern his Majesty hath for the  Spanish Ne∣therlands  Yours  c  L JENKINS  The King hath taken a Resolution to put the Laws in Execution against Dissenters and for that Purpose he sent for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen and the Justices of Peace of  Middle∣sex  My Lord Chancellor told them in the King's Name that he had long connived at the NonExecution of the Laws against Dissen∣ters but that he found his Kindness had been shewed to a sort of People that returned all his Goodness with all the Disservices and Dissaffe∣ction to himself and the Government that they were capable of That therefore his Majesty was resolved they should know what the Law could do and that they should suddenly see the Effects of his Majesty's Commands The th  of  December  I had another Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  in these Words  SIR  I Have the Favour of several of yours and you oblige us exceedingly in giving us so punctual Accounts of what occurs on your Side We are most in Pain about the Places the  French  are now blocking up and the more punctual the Account is that you give us of the Sate and Go∣vernment of that Country the better will his Majesty be enabled to take the proper Measures for the general Good Sure I am that his Ma∣jesty does take infinite Pains in order to cease the present Violences and to prevent those that may happen And you may assure your self tho' you should not be able to perswade others that there will appear Evidences of his Majesty's Con∣cern and that they are very sincere and assidu∣ous for the Good of the  Spanish Netherlands  Dear Sir I am with much Esteem  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  The Duke of  Lauderdale  being dead his Body will be carried into  Scotland  and his Garter will be given to the Duke of  Northum∣berland  who is at present by the King's Com∣mand in  Flanders  in his Travels Letters be∣ing sent to the King's Resident to wait upon the Duke thro' those Territories and he will return by  Holland  The Duke being invited to dine in  London  at the Artillery Feast some of the Factious have had a Project that the Duke of  Monmouth  the Lord  Shaftsbury  and some others should dine together that Day at some Hall in  London  but it was not liked upon the declining of their Affairs  The th of  July  the Common Hall of  London  meeting for the Choice of a Sheriff the Sheriffs declared to the People that  Papillion  and  Dubois  had each Two Thousand Voices and were chosen but the Lord Mayor hearing of it went with the usual Solemnity and decla∣red Mr  Box  the other Sheriff and Mr  North  and  Box  will hold tho' great Endeavours will be used to disswade them and it is believed the Proceedings of the present Sheriffs will be severely punished Upon the  Prince de Parma  's quitting the  Spanish  Government of  Flanders  and the  Marquis de Grana  's taking it upon him it's believed that Mr  Thomas Howard  will make the King's Compliment to him  About this time the Earl of  Shaftsbury  being brought to  Hickes  's  Hall  to be tryed for High Treason The Grand Jury found the Bill  Igno∣ramus  whereupon he was acquitted taken out of the Hands of Justice and Medals dispersed for his Deliverance Treason being frontless and secure Such a barefaced Affront to Au∣thority can scarce be parallelled as was seen at this time when the King was soon overper∣swaded to take away the Lives of many honest innocent Men purely upon the false Assevera∣tions  of Persons to whom he was almost forced to give Pensions being a Pack of profligated Villains who were kept in Pay to accuse any Man that opposed their wicked Designs with∣out any Process of Law hearing their Defence or any Proof proferred against them And after the Earl of  Shaftsbury  was thus quitted he retired privately into  Holland  where he died in the Beginning of of the Gout in his Stomach  In  June  the Lord Mayor with most of the Aldermen Sheriffs and Recorder with a great Number of the principal Citizens of  London  presented the King in Council with a Petition which had been before agreed in their Common Council wherein they did in all hum∣ble Manner deprecate his Majesty's Displeasure against them for their late Miscarriages in the Government of the City promising all Obe∣dience for the future and humbly begging his Majesty's Directions for their better Conduct The Petition was presented by the Lord May∣or kneeling with the Aldermen and all the Citizens likewise till the King was pleased to bid them rise Then the Lord Mayor and the rest being withdrawn for some time they were called in again Then the Lord Keeper deli∣vered to them his Majesty's Pleasure represen∣ting the great Cause of Mislike that his Majesty had to their former Proceedings telling them the particular Regulations that he thought ne∣cessary to require from them concluding that Judgment according to Form should be entered  against them on  Saturday  then following which might prove very prejudicial to some of their Privileges and Customs which were Matters of great Profit to them with which his Maje∣sty did not intend to meddle unless they did by the Time prescribed voluntarily put into his Majesty's Hands by such Conveyance as his Attorney Sollicitor and Counsel learned shall think fit the Approving of the Officers that have the principal Part in their Govern∣ment such as are the Lord Mayor Sheriffs and Recorder  c  so as none of them enter upon the Execution of their respective Offices notwithstanding their being elected in usual Manner thereunto till his Majesty shall also have approved of them under his Signet and Sign Manual And many Particulars more were told them by my Lord Keeper It was observed by every body present that the Sub∣mission was very cordial and that it was a great Satisfaction to the Citizens that his Majesty took this Course to preserve their Peace and to assert the just Rights of the Crown  The next Day after there was a Common Hall in  London  where it was resolved to com∣ply with his Majesty's Demands and they have saved Mr Attorney the Trouble of entering Judgment Whereupon I had this following Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  SIR  I Have the Favour of yours to acknowledge and in Return I send you the Lord Major's and City's Submission Many of our Friends voted for a Seizure upon a Scruple of Consci∣ence desiring rather the King should take those Liberties into his Hands by a Seizure than come into a Possession of them by a Surrender since that might blanch something upon the Oaths they took as Freemen However the Thing was carried by a Fair Poll for a Surrender Every Man is well pleased except those that are im∣placable and some there are amongst us still as it appears by what is now broken out for every body's Mouth is full of a most horrid and hellish Plot against the Life of the King and his Royal Highness wherein many People of the first Qua∣lity are concerned I cannot yet give you any certain Account of the Particulars but the De∣sign was laid in short to shoot the King and Duke at their coming the last Season from  Newmarket  but was prevented by the King's sudden coming from thence by reason of the Fire which hap∣pened there Several Persons are in Custody upon this Account some are fled as  Good enough  the late Under Sheriff and one Mr  West  and by the Confession of one of the Accomplices and by the Examination of another there was a desperate Design against the King's Life whom God preserve and an Insurrection was designed to follow it We have the Names of divers that are concerned but find the Birds are flown I  shall be able to tell you more by the next when you may expect farther Particulars But this I may now tell you that his Majesty who does upon all Occasions too much slight these things does believe there is great Appearance of Reality in that which is now come to Light This hath been so busy a Day with me that I have only Time to close this and to tell you that I am Sir with much Esteem  Your most Faithful Humble Servant  L JENKINS  By another good Hand from  Whitehall  of the th of  June  I am told that Mr  West  the Lawyer and Collonel  Ramsey  had sur∣rendered themselves and have been examined and confessed the whole Design of killing the King and Duke at their late coming from  New∣market  of which by God's Providence they were disappointed It is certain a more diaboli∣cal Design could never be contrived and the Ex∣aminations already taken do plainly bring it to Light Yesterday the Council met and a Pro∣clamation was ordered to be forthwith issued out to tell all the World that the Duke of  Monmouth  the Lord  Grey  Sir  Thomas Armstrong  and one  Ferguson  are of the Number of the Conspira∣tors and  L  is offered to such as shall bring in any of them If the Duke of  Monmouth  be guilty of this Crime sure it is in him more than High Treason to which the greatest Pu∣nishments of human Laws are assigned Col∣lonel  Algernoon Sidney  is sent to the  Tower  for  conspiring the Death of the King The Lord  Russel  and Mr  Trenchard  are likewise sent to the  Tower  and Major  Wildman  is taken into Custody in whose Lodgings two small FieldPieces were found altho' he declared at his being taken he had no Arms in his House and hereupon Orders were sent out to disarm all dissaffected Persons and a Committee of Lords were sent to the  Tower  to examine Collonel  Sidney  My Lord  Grey  was carrying to the  Tower  who made his Escape just at the  Tower  Gate out of the Coach from the Sergeant at Arms who was all alone with him and his Servant He went directly to the Water Side and passed over into  Southwark  The Sergeant was asleep or what is as bad consenting to it He refu∣sed to have a Guard of Soldiers and will be prosecuted with all Severity Major  Holmes  an  Oliverian  Officer and one Mr  Baillie  a  Scotchman  are sent to the  Gatehouse  for Trea∣son and  Hone  the Joyner is also seized who hath been examined And tho' he would not accuse others he hath confessed enough to hang himself The Conspiracy is confirmed by all but especially by Mr  Blaney  who was privy to most of their Intrigues His Majesty hath given Leave to the Lady  Russel  to see her Husband in the  Tower  The Escape of the Duke of  Monmouth  with some others of the Conspirators is confirmed by Letters from  Portsmouth  being embarqued on a Dogger Boat with one  Lock  a rigid Presbyterian who  was Master of her  Mead  an Independant Minister with Six more is brought from  Essex Mead  is said to have administred a Sacrament of Secrecy to the Conspirators and one  Bourn  who is said to be one of those that were to give the fatal Blow  The Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen and several of the Common Council did in an humble Address to the King and his Royal Highness congratulate their Delivery from the late Conspiracy The same did Mr  North  from  Southwark  Mr  Porter  from the  Middle Temple  Sir  John Churchill  and Mr  James Butler  from  Lincolns Inn  It is said that Sir  Thomas Jones  one of the Judges of the King's Bench will be made Lord Chief Justice in the Place of Sir  Edmund Sanders  About this time I received this following Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  SIR  I Have not yet given any Answer to the  Spa∣nish  Memorial which I sent you by the last Post but my Lord  Sunderland  hath to the  Im∣perial Holland  and  Swedish  ones It is to this Effect That the  French  Ambassador hath by Order from the King his Master declared to his Majesty that he cannot consent to the Me∣diation proposed by the Allies This is the Substance of the Answer I hope by the next to send you the precise Words Sir  Henry Ingolds∣by  and Mr  Rouse  are taken into Custody for treasonable Matters and Mr  Aaron Smith  is  sent to the  Tower  for High Treason The Lord  Russel  Mr  West  and  Hone  the Joyner have received Notice to prepare for their Tryal and the Lady  Russel  presented a Petition to the King humbly praying that her Husband might have such Council allowed him as he shall judge ne∣cessary for his Defence at his intended Tryal  I am Sir Your  c L JENKINS  The th of  July  I received this ensu∣ing Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  SIR  OUR Toil here that hath hindered my wri∣ting to you is so far from ceasing that it increases daily So universal by God's Blessing is the Discovery and consequently the Defeat of the Conspiracy The Earl of  Essex  is sent for this Afternoon to the Council and so is Mr  Henry Booth  of  Cheshire  and others You will judge of the Reasonableness or rather the Necessity of this Way of Proceeding by the Account you will hear of the Tryal of some of the Conspirators that will come on this Week The Duke meets the King constantly at the Ca∣binet Council as formerly I am Sir ever  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  The Grand Jury of  London  have found Bill of Indictment against these Persons following  Thomas Walcot Richard Goodenough Richard  Rumbold Nathaniel Wade Richard Nelthorp Robert Ferguson William Thomson James Bur∣ton John Rouse Edward Norton James Hol∣loway Joseph Tilly Francis Goodenough Wil∣liam Hone William Blague  Lord  Russel  Lord  Grey  Duke of  Monmouth  Sir  Thomas Arm∣strong  and accordingly  Walcot Rouse Hone  and  Blague  were arraigned immediately and  Walcot  Being brought to his Tryal after a long Hearing was found Guilty of High Treason by the Jury He confess'd he was not to have killed the King but had engaged himself to oppose the Guards This Morning being the th of  July  the Lord  Russel  and  Hone  the Joyner were brought to their Tryal and found Guilty of High Treason At the same time the King being visiting a Fortification that was making in the  Tower  the Earl of  Essex  withdrawing into his Closet cut his own Throat with his Razor of which he died im∣mediately  The th of  July  the Privy Council met and the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen attending were sent for into the Council and the Lord Chancellor told them That the King had taken Notice of the irregular Proceeding of the Common Hall about the Election of She∣riffs and the great Disorders occasioned there∣by and that for the Prevention of farther Mischief his Majesty did command the Lord Mayor to begin the whole Proceeding  de novo  and that his Lordship should take great Care to maintain the ancient Customs of the City  Whereupon the Common Hall meeting the Order of Council was read and my Lord Mayor told them That in Obedience to it they were to begin their whole Proceedings  de novo  and accordingly Mr  North  was put up to be confirm'd and the Lord Mayor declared him one of the Sheriffs Then they were to go to the Poll which Sheriff  Chute  declared they did with a  salvo Jure  to their former Choice and the Sheriffs had made a Column in their Poll Bill to Poll negatively against Mr  North  's Confirmation with which the Lord Mayor was so unsatisfied that he ad∣journed the Poll till the next Day intending then his own Officers to take the Poll  The th of  July Walcot Hone  and  Rouse  were executed at  Tyburn  the first of them most remarkably penitent and hath made a Decla∣ration under his Hand of many more Particu∣lars of his own and others Guilt in this hor∣rid Conspiracy than hath been yet imputed to them To morrow the Lord  Russel  will lose his Head in  LincolnsInnFields  of which I had this following Account from a very good Hand at  Whitehall On  Saturday  the Lord  Russel  was brought to the Place of his Execu∣tion in his own Coach accompanied with Dr  Tillotson  and Dr  Burnet  He behaved himself with great Courage The Execution being ended a Speech was published by his La∣dy's Direction wherein were several Reflecti∣ons defaming the Justice of the Nation and Dr  Burnet  being suspected to have had a Hand  in it he was examined before the Council about it and one  Johnson  the late Lord  Russel  's Chaplain was examined as well about the said Speech as for some Passages in the Life of  Julian the Apostate  whereof he was the Author A Declaration containing an Account of the Rise and Progress of the present Conspiracy hath been read and approved in Council and in pursuance of it the    th of  September  is appointed a Day of solemn Thanksgiving in all Churches for so great a Deliverance  At the same time I am told from  Whitehall  that Prince  George  of  Denmark  was arrived that he was a Person of a good Mein and had dined with the King Queen and Duke who gave the Prince the upper Hand The Court will soon return to  Windsor  where the Marriage between the Prince and Lady  Anne  will be consummated His Presents which are very noble are pre∣sented to her and their Families will be settled after the Manner of the Duke's and Dutchess's but not so numerous A Chapter will be held at  Windsor  for chusing Prince  George  into the most noble Order of the Garter but the Prince hath desired it may be deferred till he hath written to the King of  Denmark  for his Leave to forbear wearing the Order of the Elephant for that it would not be seemly to wear that and the Order of the Garter at the same time  The King's Declaration concerning the Plot gives great Satisfaction wherein the particular Steps and Methods of it were set down and  Mr  Carlton  who is named in the King's De∣claration is brought up from  Oxfordshire  where he was seized and being very intimate with the late Earl of  Shaftsbury  he hath been ex∣amined by the Council and is still in the Mes∣senger's Hands and is putting in Writing what he knows of the Conspiracy which is expected to be very considerable because of his known Intimacy with the late Earl The present Earl and the Lord  Ashley  his Son who is a very hopeful young Gentleman have kissed the King's Hand at  Windsor  The King hath de∣sired his Royal Highness to forbear Hunting this Season it not being safe for him at this time when such villainous Designs are disco∣vered against his Life One Major  Creed  and Major  Gladman  two  Oliverian  Officers are both seized upon Account of this Conspiracy Mr  Speake  of  Somersetshire  is also seized and continues in the Custody of one of the King's Messengers and Mr  Hawkins  of the  Temple  a great Confidant of the late Earl of  Shaftsbury  hath been taken and examined before the Lords of the Council and hath since had his Liberty upon Bail The  Marquis de Tilladet  and the  Marquis de la Fare  were sent by the  French  King and the Duke of  Orleans  to congratulate with his Majesty and his Royal Highness upon the Discovery of this Conspiracy The King sends the Earl of  Dumbarton  and the Duke and Mr  Nichols  of the Bedchamber to con∣dole with the  French  King upon the Death of his Queen which hath put our Court into  Mourning for Three Months The First of  October  I received this following Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  SIR  I presented yours of the th current to his Majesty who read every Word of it him∣self and then I presented him with your pri∣vate Letter to me touching Mr  Cittar  's Infor∣mation against you concerning your Religion The King commanded me to tell you from him that such Complaints as those should do you no Prejudice in his Majesty's Thoughts That he very well approves of the Service you do him and that he will always have a gracious Pro∣tection for you I am Sir  Your most Humble Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  The th of  November  following I received this Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  all written with his own Hand  SIR  YOur last private Letter as well as your publick one were read before his Majesty yesterday in Council Your Answers to the Go∣vernour were well approved of especially that Article wherein you observed to him That it is out of the Sphere of any foreign Ministers to take upon them to alledge or make use of any Argument grounded upon the Sentiment or De∣sires of the Subjects and Vassals of the Prince  that a foreign Minister so alledging resides with For Example would the King of  Spain  have taken it well that Sir  Henry Goodrick  should have urged why he offered his Majesty's Arbi∣trage the Sentiments or Desires of the  Spanish  Nation either in their Provinces or else in other Territories of the Catholick King Can  Don Pedro de Ronquillos  make it out that the City of  London  does desire that his Majesty should embark in a War Does he know the Sentiments of the Council of  Scotland  and  Ire∣land  Hath he put all the Sentiments of those great Bodies into a Balance Does he know which amongst them will preponderate There was a Time and 'tis within your Memory and mine when not only foreign Ministers with Character but their very Clerks and  Valets de Chambre  did meddle with our Affairs of State and might as they thought with our publick Councils This was an Indignity upon the King I hope it will be so no more Sure I am of one thing they did not do our Business which they pretended highly to do if they have done their own much good may it do them You have already all the Account I can give you of the Duke of  Monmouth  saving that yesterday Evening after Council he came to my Office and I discharged the Sergeant at Arms that had him in Custody Then I waited upon him as I had been ordered to the Duke The Duke car∣ried him immediately to the King After his Examination the King carried him to the Queen Then the Duke brought him back again to his  own Side to the Dutchess and he was all this Morning at Court I am Sir  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  It seems the Lord Privy Seal the Duke of  Ormond  and several other Lords of the Privy Council knowing for certain that the Duke of  Monmouth  was at Court and had been well received and pardoned by the King went to visit the Duke of  Monmouth  at the  Cockpit  and some People had the Confidence to contra∣dict what was published concerning the Duke of  Monmouth  tho' nothing was printed con∣cerning him but by Order from the King and Council and entered  verbatim  in the Council Book that it might be kept in particular However what was printed concerning the Duke of  Monmouth  was the Subject of much Discourse and the Whiggs and factious People had the Impudence to say it was false and that the Duke of  Monmouth  did not make any Con∣fession of the Conspiracy and the Thing went so far that Reports were spread abroad of Discourses the Duke of  Monmouth  had himself held to that Purpose and that the printed Re∣lation was injurious to him so that there was a Necessity that some publick Notice should be taken of it and that the Duke of  Monmouth  should vindicate the King's Honour as well as his own by owning publickly the Confession he had made to the King in Presence of his Royal Highness with which his Majesty was so well  pleased as not only to grant him his Pardon which was to pass forthwith under the Great Seal but likewise gave him a considerable Sum of Money for the Frankness of his Confession But upon the Duke of  Monmouth  's denying what was published concerning him and ha∣ving declared the same in divers publick Places and the Persons being sent for and examined they declared That they heard the Duke of  Monmouth  himself deny that he had made any such Confession of the Conspiracy and the Factious thereupon beginning to shew them∣selves with great Confidence it was thought absolutely necessary that publick Notice should be taken of it Whereupon the King required the Duke of  Monmouth  to make a publick De∣claration either before the Council or else to confess publickly what he had declared and owned to his Majesty when he was first brought to the King by his Royal Highness But the Duke of  Monmouth  then having his Pardon un∣der the Great Seal and the Money which the King gave him did absolutely refuse to con∣form to what his Majesty so justly required of him and which the Duke of  Monmouth  should not have made the least Scruple of doing The King was so highly offended at the Duke's re∣fusing to perform so necessary a Part of his Du∣ty that he forthwith ordered Mr ViceCham∣berlain  Saville  to signify to him his Majesty's Pleasure That he should not any more come into the King's Presence and that he should presently leave the Court which the Duke  of  Monmouth  did and took a little House in  Holbourn  to the Astonishment of all Men that had any Duty for the King or Government Upon this the Whiggs and factious People made it the great Subject of all their Discourses Whereupon the King was pleased to declare publickly That the Duke of  Monmouth  did confess to him in Presence of the Duke all the Plot and did repeat to him all the conside∣rable Particulars sworn by the Witnesses and did assure the King that what the Lord  Howard  of  Escrick  had sworn against  Algernoon Sidney  was true and that he was one of the most dangerous Men to the Government in his Ma∣jesty's Dominions And yet at the same time several Persons of Credit deposed That they had heard the Duke of  Monmouth  disown what was published about him and refused to make a publick Declaration of what he had confessed and owned to the King  Soon after this the King was pleased to ac∣quaint the Lords of his Council That having received the Duke of  Monmouth  into his Mer∣cy and having since heard several Reports from the Duke's own Servants and others that the Duke had made no Confession to his Majesty of the Conspiracy nor owned any Share he had in it The King did therefore think fit for the Vindication of the Truth of what the Duke of  Monmouth  had declared to him and the Duke of  York  to require the same from him in wri∣ting a Letter under his own Hand which the said Duke of  Monmouth  refused to do in the Terms  it was commanded him His Majesty was so much offended therewith that he had forbid him his Presence and commanded him to depart the Court And for the farther Information of the Council his Majesty had directed the Letter that the Duke had been required to sign to be entered in the Council Book declaring he did not intend it should be a Secret The Letter was as follows  I Have heard some Reports of me as if I should have lessened the late Plot and have gone about to discredit the Evidence against those that have died by Justice Your Majesty and the Duke know how ingenuously I have owned the late Conspiracy and tho' I was not conscious of any Design against your Majesty's Life yet I lament the having a great Hand in the other Part of the Conspiracy which was the Confederacy Sir I have taken the Liberty to put this in Wri∣ting for my own Vindication and I beseech you to look forward and endeavour to forget the Fault you have forgiven me and I will take Care never to commit any more against you nor to come within the Danger of being again misled from my Duty but shall make it the Business of my whole Life to deserve the Pardon your Ma∣jesty hath given to  Your most Dutiful Son  c  The King having made this Declaration con∣cerning the Duke of  Monmouth  to the Council caused it to be entered in the Council Book  that Copies might be taken of it which gave a general and great Satisfaction whereas many before began to be staggered with the Reports that were with so much Confidence or rather Impudence spread abroad and the great Won∣der was why the Duke of  Monmouth  should refuse to give the King and the World the Sa∣tisfaction of signing the abovewritten Paper The Duke of  Monmouth  declared upon going from his House in  Holbourn  that he would re∣tire privately to his House in  Moore Park  but none know at least publickly where he now is and I have been told from a good Hand at  Whitehall  that he had written a submissive Let∣ter to the King but not being in the Terms his Majesty expected he would take no Notice of it  Mr  Algernoon Sidney  will executed the next Week the Warrant being signed for his Execution and the Lord Chief Justice hath committed two Persons to  Newgate  for using some scandalous Expressions concerning Mr  Sid∣ney  's Tryal and Jury it being fit that some should be made Examples to teach others to govern their Tongues On the th of  Decem∣ber  Mr  Sidney  was beheaded He came on Foot from the  Tower  to the Scaffold upon  Tower Hill  He there saluted the People and gave the Sheriffs a Paper which he desired might be communicated to the World and kneeling down he prayed to himself for some Minutes and then rising undressed himself The She∣riffs asked him if he had nothing to say who  answered he had nothing to say or to do but to die And being undressed and putting on his Cap he laid himself down and bid the Executioner do his Duty who struck off his Head at one Blow The Sheriffs carried the Paper to the King which was an Invective against the Government his Judges Jury and Witnesses and concludes with this Expression That he  doubts not but God Almighty will con∣tinue to own the Cause for which he died  He shewed a great Courage and Unconcernedness for Death but it is to be wished he had shewed a more Christian Temper He had no Minister with him having a Religion of his own and his Paper may be justly called a very venemous Libel He seems to justify the last Rebellion and prayed God still to support the Old Cause for which he appeared so eminently heretofore It is certain that he carried his detestable Princi∣ples against Monarchy and the established Go∣vernment with him to his Grave and gloried in his treasonable Actions and Practices rather than repented of them The Paper he gave the Sheriffs will not be printed it begins thus  Men Brethren and Fathers Friends Country∣men and Strangers  and having justified his own Book and exclaimed against the Proceed∣ings at his Tryal it ends thus  By these means am I brought hither the Lord forgive their Practices and avert the Evils which threaten the Nation from them Lord sanctify these my Sufferings unto me and tho' I fall a Sacrifice to Idols suffer not Idolatry to be established in  the Land Bless thy People and save them Defend thy own Cause defend them that defend it Stir up such as are faint direct such as are willing confirm such as waver give Wisdom and Integrity to All Order all things so as they may redound to thy Glory and grant I may die glorifying thee for all thy Mercies and for that thou hast at last permitted me to be singled out as a Witness of thy Truth and even by the Con∣fession of my Opposers for  The Old Cause  for which thou hast so often and so wonderfully declared thy self  The Lord Mayor of  York  is summoned to answer before the Council several High Misde∣meanours charged against him and having appeared before the Council he was obliged to give Bail to answer the Information that shall be exhibited against him by Mr Attorney Ge∣neral In  December  I received this en∣suing Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  writ∣ten with his own Hand  SIR  I Cannot think but you will easily call to Mind how the King hath proceeded with the Duke of  Monmouth  having already seen all the Re∣lations that were written and printed concerning him I have only one thing to observe to you in the whole Transaction of that Business which is this that the King's Resolution in that Affair hath been owing to no Man's Counsel but to his Majesty's own Firmness and tho' his Tenderness was great for the Duke of  Monmouth  yet he  suffered it not to prevail against that which he owed to his lawful Successor and to his dutiful Subjects I am Sir  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  I received this following Letter from a very good Hand at  Whitehall  bearing Date the th of  December  SIR  THE Depredations of the  French  in  Flan∣ders  does generally affect us here being no great Lovers of the  French  and do not speak very favourably of their Proceedings The poor People of  Flanders  are much pitied who suffer for the Imprudence of those at the Helm We wish the  Spaniards  may be perswaded to put an End to the Miseries of their Subjects by esta∣blishing a good and lasting Peace Our Mer∣chants who have great Effects in  Spain  are much alarmed but we hope there is no Need I can tell you no News but that the Lord  Lansborough  formerly Sir  George Lane  and the Earl of  Plymouth  Governour of  Hull  are lately dead and that there is no Appearance of a Parliament as some have imagined for if his Majesty intended one the Time is near to give Orders for it  Upon the Prince of  Denmark  's first Arrival in  England  a Chapter was appointed for the chusing him a Knight of the Garter but the  Prince prayed it might be deferred till he ac∣quainted the King of  Denmark  his Brother therewith and had his Leave to lay aside the Order of the Elephant which was judged very reasonable And the Prince having accordingly made his Compliments to the King of  Denmark  upon this Occasion and received Leave from him a Chapter is appointed to be held forth∣with for the electing him into the most noble Order of the Garter The Lord  Dartmouth  hath found more Difficulty in demolishing the Mole at  Tangier  than was imagined but it is now so near done that his Lordship is expected very suddenly

the Ordinary have been carefully read before his Majesty in Council I now send you a Copy of the last Memorial the  Spanish  Ambassador gave his Majesty I could not send it sooner because it had not been com∣municated to the Lords I was directed by the King to give Answer to it by Word of Mouth to  Don Pedro  but strictly commanded not to give it in Writing or to dictate it that he might take a Copy which I did punctually observe which gave him great Distaste I send you the Words as near as I can but with this strict Injunction from the King that you do not communicate them to any Person for then that which we refused them will come to them another Way The An∣swer is communicated to you for your own Go∣vernment when the Ministers there shall dis∣course to you at the rate of  Don Pedro  's Memo∣rial without letting them know that you know  the Words wherein I answered him That which you propose concerning an Allowance for Expresses is hardly practicable the constant ancient Way being to put it upon your Extraordinaries But in regard they are in so great Arrears to you I will take upon me to pay any Express you shall send knowing you will only send them when it is needful I am ever  Your most Faithful Humble Servant  L JENKINS  In the Beginning of the Year following the Court of King's Bench gave Judgment in the great Case of the  East India  Company and were unanimously of Opinion that Judgment ought to be given for the Plaintiffs which are the  East India  Company Their Arguments were all resolved into these two Questions First Whether the Grant of a sole Trade to the Company without Prohibition to all the rest of the King's Subjects not to trade to those Parts be a good Grant Secondly Suppose the Grant be good whether this Action be maintainable And the whole Court held in the Affirmative to both And that in the First Point as well the prohibitory as the enabling Part were consistent both with the Laws of the Land and the Law of Nations Which the Lord Chief Justice made out with much painful Learning by citing many Authorities and Precedents out of the Parliament Rolls and foreign Books whereby he proved that  Jus Gentium  must be the Judge of foreign Trade  by which it was at first established as it is re∣gulated in all other Nations As to the Obje∣ction that this excluding Grant was a Mono∣poly he distinguished upon the Word proving out of several Books of the Civil Law that Monopolies are of two Sorts either Lawful as when the Prince grants to any College a sole Trade exclusive of all other Persons Or Un∣lawful according to the vulgar Acceptation of the Word and that this Grant is of the for∣mer Sort and not such a Monopoly as the Law condemns The Court held That the Statute of  Edw  III pleaded by the Defendant had Relation only to the Trade of the Staple and could not be intended to controul this which was not then in Being Yet supposing the Sta∣tute were powerful and gave Licence to all Persons to trade every where yet the King having by the common Law a Power of re∣straining his Subjects from trading and there being no express Words in the Statute to take away this Power the Statute as to that is void according to the Rule set down by my Lord  Cook  that without express Words no Prerogative shall be taken away The Court said further That tho' the King had covenan∣ted with the Company to grant no Licences to any other Persons of a concurrent Trade yet the King hath not hereby concluded him∣self but that he may at his Pleasure license any of his Subjects to trade to the Places men∣tioned in the Charter  This being a Matter of Curiosity I give you this particular Account for your Satisfaction  The th of  December  I had this following Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  SIR  I Have received your double Letter one of the Occurrences of the Field and the other of a Discourse you had with the Governour They were both read to his Majesty first in pri∣vate then at a Committee of the Council I have nothing in Command to answer upon them I may only tell you that your Discourses and Replies in your Conversation with the Gover∣nour were very well approved of You will I supose have heard on this some Complaints of Mr  Chudleigh  You may believe it morally im∣possible he should have had such Discourses to the Deputies of  Amsterdam  as are endeavou∣red to be fastened upon him It is the  Spanish  Ambassador  Don Pedro  that alone complains of him and we do not hear one Syllable of this from Mr  Cittars  nor from  Monsieur le Compte de Thaun  who would have been as loud as the  Spanish  Ambassador in their Complaints had they known of any unwarrantable Discourse of Mr  Chudleigh  's in the Conferences he may have had with any Deputies or private Persons what∣soever You know that the King our Master hath of a long time I am sure for above a Year declared  Qu'il ne se laisseroit pas en∣tretenir par quelle fuit dans une Guerre estran∣gere  Thus much Mr  Chudleigh  might say upon  any pertinent Occasion but more I dare say never fell from him I shall not fail to comply with Mr  Puckle  's Demand nor in any thing else wherein I may to approve my self  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  I had another Letter from a good Hand at  Whitehall  of the th of  January  which says that Mr  Cornish  who was an Al∣derman of  London  before their Privileges were seized into the King's Hands was examined before the Lords of the Cabinet Council he being named in the Letter taken in  Ellis  's Pocket amongst those to whom the Libel was to be distributed and  Slingsby Bethell  his wor∣thy Collegue when Sheriffs was amongst others fined One Thousand Merks for the Riot by them committed in  GuildHall  on Midsum∣mer Day and has ever since been a Pri∣soner but has at last thought fit to pay his Fine and is now at Liberty again We have an Account from  Scotland  that  Baillie  a Gen∣tleman of a good Estate being sent thither to be tryed was found Guilty of High Treason and executed That the Earl of  Ferras  had been brought to his Tryal for being in the late Conspiracy and was found Guilty like∣wise but having confessed as well before as at his Tryal the whole Matter charged upon him and cast himself upon the King's Mercy  his Execution was stopped till the King's Plea∣sure was known therein  The th of  February  I received this ensuing Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  SIR  HIS Majesty hath received from Mr  Van Cittars  a Memorial of so great a Length that I cannot hope to send it you till the next Post It is accompanied with five several Maps of several Parts of the  Spanish Netherlands  It prays his Majesty's Offices in order to dispose the most Christian King to give up  Brisac Fri∣burg  and the Fort of  Keil  near  Strasburgh  to the Empire if he will keep  Strasburgh  to himself Then for the  Spanish Netherlands  the Allies do offer tho' without the Consent of  Spain  to divide the Country by an imaginary Line to the End the  French  may possess all on the one Side of it and the  Spaniards  all on the other and it is to be noted that not only most of the Dependencies in  Flanders  that are con∣troverted are in the  Spanish  Side of the Line but also all that the  French  do possess in  Luxen∣burgh  even to the Walls of  Chiny  and  Verton  which the  Spaniards  have long since relinquished His Majesty is not come to any Resolution upon this Memorial having not yet received the Let∣ters of his own Minister at the  Hague  But thus far we see that this is the Effect of the Conferences now held at the  Hague  and this is intended to be the Answer to Mr  d'Araux  's Offers of a Truce When those things ripen  you shall have a farther Account of them from Sir  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  The th of  March  following I received this ensuing from the same Hand  SIR  I Thank you heartily for yours which came but this Day but I would not have you be discou∣raged by this Accident of writing by the Way of  Calais  for we had not our Letters from  Paris  then Nay give me Leave to invite you to make use of this Conveyance in an active trou∣blesome Time as this Spring and Summer are like to be and therefore you may send the Ori∣ginal one Way and the Duplicate another Sure I am that you will omit no Conveniency and so leave it to your self and am ever  c  L JENKINS  On  Saturday  last Mr  Van Cittars  gave a Me∣morial to his Majesty seconding his last Memo∣rial My Lord  Sunderland  by his Majesty's Command gave him an Answer only by Word of Mouth and to the same Effect with that Answer which his Lordship had given before in Writing to Mr  Van Cittars  's Memorial formerly delive∣red upon the same Subject  Upon the st of  March  I received this en∣suing Letter from Mr Secretary  Jenkins  dated at  Whitehall  SIR  IN your last which was read yesterday before the King and Council you are pleased to de∣sire to know the King's Pleasure whether you should go into the Campaign with that Governour His Majesty resolved that it was not necessary because the Scene of the War in that Country being like to be of a very narrow Compass and not far from the Place where you have always resided which being the Capital of that Coun∣try will still have the best Share in the Intelli∣gence One thing that concerns my self I shall take Leave to impart to you with a very sincere Joy It is That his Majesty hath upon my most humble and even importunate Suit given me Leave in regard of my ill Health to resign my Post of Secretary and hath bestowed it up∣on Mr  Godolphin  in whose Correspondence as far as it will take in your Deportment you will I am sure be very happy My great Concern is that this being a pure Effect of my most hum∣ble Supplication and even intolerable Importu∣nity with his Majesty and the Duke it may not be imputed to any Surprize upon me at Court much less to my disliking of the present Measures there This I say because I know the Fanaticks will put the most malicious Constructions they can invent upon an Incident at Court But up∣on my honest Word Sir it is my utter Disabi∣lity to serve and that alone which hath pre∣vailed upon his Majesty's infinite Clemency and Goodness to consent to my Dismission with such  Marks of his Grace and Royal Bounty as to me are unexpressible This I thought it my Duty to impart to you to prevent Misinformation and to let you know at the same time that I shall be glad in what private Capacity soever I am to approve my self in Truth and Effect Sir  Your most Humble and most Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  I had the th of  April  following this Let∣ter from the same Hand at  Whitehall  SIR  I Have just Time to tell you that I had the Honour on  Tuesday  Night to produce your last Letter before his Majesty and the Commit∣tee You may be well assured that I did not neglect humbly to inform my self of his Majesty's Pleasure in Mr  Hulft  's Business His Majesty was pleased to tell me That he had a good Cha∣racter of Mr  Hulft  a good while since and that whenever he comes into  England  whether with a publick Character or in a private Capacity his Majesty will very graciously bid him welcome  I am Sir  c L JENKINS  After this in  April  I received this ensuing Letter from the same Hand dated at  Windsor  the th of  April    SIR  THis is the last Trouble I shall give you as his Majesty's Secretary but shall desire the Continuance of your Kindness as a Friend for so I shall always be to you The State of Mr  Boyan  's Case herewith sent you and the Copy of his Majesty's Letter to the  Marquis de Grana  thereupon may dispense with me for gi∣ving you any farther Instructions in this Matter You will deliver his Majesty's Letter to the Mar∣quis and accompany it with such Memorials and Applications as you shall judge requisite and may be most effectual that Mr  Boyan  may obtain his Right I know your Diligence and Zeal and therefore shall use no more Words but again to assure you that I am Sir  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  The Copy of the King's Letter to the Marquis  Mon Cousin  LE Sieur  Richard Boyan  Marchand de  Londres  m'ayant representé qu'il a un Procez a anvers contre un nommé  Guilliam Vandevorst  Marchand de cette Ville la pour quelques Affaires mercantilles mais que par les chicans dont le dit  Vandevorst  quelques siens Parens ont usé comme ayans Interest sur les lieux mon dit sujet etant estrangere j' ay bien voulu ordonner à mon Resident a  Bruxelles  de vous presenter des Memoires convenables tou∣chant la dit Affaire ne doutant pas que Vous ne donnez tels Ordres la dessus que bonne brieüe justice soit fait à mon dit sujet Je suis Mon Cousin  Vôtre Affectionné Cousin  CHARLES  R  After Sir  Leoline Jenkins  had quitted his Station of being Principal Secretary of State I had the following Letter from him dated at  Hammersmith  the th of  May  which was the last Letter I had from him  SIR  I Have often pitied you very heartily under the intolerable Pains you take in writing so many Letters with your own Hand I must now in Conscience not only pray you but in a manner require you to ease your self of writing any longer to me and I shall reckon my Obliga∣tion no less than if you did this His Majesty allows me the Honour of Access as before to the Committee of Foreign Affairs so that as often as I go thither I shall be sure to meet with your Intelligence and when my Health does not give me Leave to do so my Friends are pleased to communicate unto me so much as serves my Turn But if at anytime your own Occasions invite you to write to me I pray do it very freely for in those Matters you may command me still as Sir  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant  L JENKINS  The th of  May  I had this following Letter from a very good Hand  SIR  I Am sure that the  Spanish  Ambassador hath been spoken to concerning the Treatment which they gave the Duke of  Monmouth  at  Brussels  and has been given to understand the great Resentment the King hath of their Pro∣ceedings Hereupon the  Spanish  Ambassador has taken an Occasion to speak to the King assuring him that the Civilities which were shewed him at  Brussels  were purely in respect to his Majesty as being his Son of which I am told the King took hold and hath caused a Letter to be written to the Ambassador to let that Court know the little Satisfaction his Ma∣jesty hath in their treating the Duke of  Mon∣mouth  as they have done and yet the  Spanish  Ambassador continues his Instances tho' he knows they cannot succeed to his Satisfaction For he that asketh a Thing that cannot be granted without the great Prejudice of him that is to grant it cannot certainly think to obtain what he desires and has not so much Cause to be dis∣satisfied when refused as he hath of whom he desires a Thing to his Prejudice I suppose it will be no News to tell you that the  French  King hath given Assurances that after the Ta∣king of  Luxenburgh  he will not attempt any thing farther in  Flanders  The  Count d'Araux  hath declared thus much at the  Hague  upon  which it is not doubted but the  States  will re∣solve to sit still and let the  Spaniards  manage the War as they will if they will not comply with the  French  Proposals We have no News from my Lord  Dartmouth  at  Tangier  expecting that he is coming home and will be speedily in  England  The Duke of  Monmouth  is highly caressed at the  Hague  which would make me wonder what the Prince of  Orange  aims at by such a Proceeding The King was pleased to de∣clare in the last Council at  HamptonCourt  that he thought fit that his Royal Highness should be present at the Meeting of the Council and ac∣cordingly the Duke took his Place at the Board as First Prince of the Blood  I am told from a good Hand that the King hath forbid all Correspondence with the Prince of  Orange  and hath declared to the Nobility and others attending him that they should hold no Commerce with the Prince who hath given the old  Hoffe  where the Princess his Grandmother lived at the  Hague  to the Duke of  Monmouth  We expect daily a publick Ac∣count of the Discovery lately made in  Scotland  it being as plain as the Day that the Conspi∣racy was so laid between the Rebels here and in  Scotland  as to make an Insurrection in both Kingdoms at the same time upon which many Gentlemen whom they call Lairds are com∣mitted to Prison it appearing that the Design of the Conspiracy was to have surprized  Berwick  and thereby have opened their Way to  Newcastle  By the Deposition of one  Carstairs  who was taken in  England  and sent to  Scotland  and by several others the Correspondence is made so plain between the Conspirators here and in  Scotland  that there is no farther Doubt made of it it being sufficiently made appear But at the same time it is worthy Remark that all their Credit in  Scotland  could not raise Thirty Thousand Pounds to carry on their Plot I am told from a good Hand that  Danvers  who is now in the  Gazette  was the Author of that damna∣ble Libel about the Earl of  Essex  being a Parcel of Lies and Forgeries maliciously put together to perswade the Whiggs and the Ignorant that the then Earl of  Essex  was murdered by Order from the Government when it was apparent that he cut his own Throat Circular Letters have been written by the King's Commands to all the Lords Lieutenants of the Counties of this Kingdom to this Effect That the King being informed Reports were spread abroad in the Country that his Majesty intended to call a Parliament and that many Gentlemen have thereupon begun to make Interests to be cho∣sen his Majesty had thought fit to let them know that he has not at present any Intention to call a Parliament and when he shall find it ne∣cessary for his Service and the publick Good to call one he will cause timely Notice to be given thereof and in the mean time commands them to take Care to suppress all such false Reports and to punish the Authors of them And his Majesty being informed that Endeavours have  been used to promote a tumultuary Petition for the Sitting of Parliament his Majesty com∣mands them to crush such seditious Practices tending to the great Disturbance of the Go∣vernment and the publick Peace and to enquire for the Authors and Promoters of them  There are in  London  about Sixty Companies of which Fourty and more have already sur∣rendered their Charters to his Majesty who hath been pleased to grant them new ones with such Alterations and Limitations as the King thinks necessary for his Service and those Companies which do yet stand out will be proceeded against in another Way  I am told from a very good Hand at  White∣hall  by Letter of the th of  June  That the Duke's Counsel let Mr  Oates  in the  King's Bench  Prison know that there was a Declaration filed against him on the Part of the Duke for false and scandalous Words and that if he pleaded not Judgment should be entered against him by Default He replied according to his insolent Manner That as he had never loved the Duke so he did not fear him and that he would answer the Declara∣tion when he thought fit and that for the entering Judgment by Default he could not for he would stay in Prison till there was a Parliament and then he should come out and others would be in his Place Upon this the Duke's Counsel moved at the King's Bench Bar That if  Oates  suffered Judgment to be entered by Default in this Action of the Duke the  Court would then grant a Writ of Enquiry of Damages to be executed at the Bar The Aim of the Duke's Counsel in desiring this is that the Matter they charge  Oates  with may be laid open to the World by having the Witnesses examined in open Court  The Yacht that brought over Sir  Thomas Armstrong  being arrived at  Greenwich  he was brought on Shore by Captain  Richardson  the Keeper of  Newgate  who put Shackles upon him and brought him to  Whitehall  where he hath been examined by a Committee of Lords but would confess nothing It seems Mr  Chud∣leigh  having Notice that Seven or Eight  Eng∣lishmen  were come to  Rotterdam  he sent his Secretary who discovered them at  Delft  and followed them to  Leyden  and having lodged them there he applied himself to the Scout in Pursuance of an Order Mr  Chudleigh  had obtained some time before of the States and having the Scout's Assistance he went to the House where they were and seized  Armstrong  without any Opposition The others with him were not meddled with for that they were not mentioned in the Order of the States  Armstrong  was carried to Mr  Chudleigh  's House at the  Hague  and from thence on board the Yacht at  Rotterdam  Since his coming to  London  he hath been brought to the King's Bench where Execution was prayed against him But he pleaded a Statute of  Edward  VI which says if a Person outlawed yield himself within a Year and Day he shall be admitted to a Tryal  But he was answered he did not yield him∣self but was brought in by Force and so could not claim the Benefit of that Statute He re∣plied the King had allowed  Holloway  who was likewise outlawed the Liberty to reverse the Outlawry and to stand a Tryal and hoped he should not be denied it He was answered by the Judges that was the King's particular Grace and Mercy of which they were not the Dispensers and that there remained nothing for them to do but to order his Execution which they did accordingly He did not seem inclined to make any Confession nor to have the Sense that a Man ought to have that had Guilt upon him After this a Motion was made on his Behalf in the Court of Chancery for a Writ of Error to reverse the Outlawry But my Lord Keeper answered he could not grant it without Mr Attorney's Consent who said he had no Directions to consent to it One would think Sir  Thomas  ought not to expect any Mercy or Favour from the King to whom he hath been so ungrateful But I must not for∣get to tell you that when he was taken he dropt some Papers into a House of Office but they were found and amongst them were Let∣ters from the Duke of  Monmouth  to the Sieur  Dien  the  Brandenburgh  Minister at the  Hague  and another to one of the States recommend∣ing Sir  Thomas Armstrong  to them in the most pressing Manner imaginable He was executed at  Tyburn  drawn thither from  Newgate  upon a Sledge He saluted several People as he  went He had Dr  Tennison  to pray with him and died with much Courage and Resolution His Head will be put up over the  Gatehouse  at  Westminster  and his Quarters will be dis∣posed of in like manner One of his Quarters will be sent to  Stafford  for which Place he was a Burgess in Parliament By his Paper which he gave the Sheriff he justifies his In∣nocency and complains that he had not a Tryal  After Sir  Thomas  's Execution the Paper he gave the Sheriffs was first brought to the King and his Majesty gave it again to the Sheriffs with Liberty to publish it In it he disowns to know of any Plot against the King's Person and Government and asserts his Innocency to those Matters He justified himself of what was reported of him of betraying the King in  Cromwell  's Time He declared he died a Mem∣ber of the Church of  England  but confessed he had not lived according to her Rules and Doctrines He said he died justly for the ma∣ny Sins he had committed in his Lifetime and desired those he had injured to forgive him as he forgave every Body  About this time was  Oates  's Tryal with the Duke where no less than Ten Witnesses swore That  Oates  had said his Royal Highness was  a Traitor a Rascal a Devil the Son of a Whore  with other Words not fit to be named were it not to shew the audacious Insolence of  Oates  who may possibly e'er long be called to an Account for many other things Mr  Wil∣liams  late Speaker of the House of Commons had a Declaration filed against him for having caused several Papers called Votes and Ad∣dresses of the House of Commons to be prin∣ted and published wherein were many scan∣dalous Reflections upon his Majesty and his Government of which the said Mr  Williams  having Notice he did not appear in  Westmin∣sterhall  the last Day of the Term which he never missed before  I was told from a good Hand at  Whitehall  by Letters of the th of  June  That the Lord Treasurer of  Scotland  with several other Lords of that Kingdom were come to the  English  Court to complain against the Chancellor of  Scotland  That the King and Duke had heard their Complaints which they found so well grounded that the Great Seal was taken from the Chancellor whose Name is Sir  George Gordon  and the Earl of  Perth  was constituted Lord Chancellor of  Scotland  and the Place he had of Justice General was given to the Earl of  Linlithgow  Collonel of the Guards and the said Regiment of Guards was given to Collonel  Douglas  Brother to the Lord Treasurer the Marquess of  Queensborough  who has at present a  Scotch  Regiment in Service of the States General and Matters being thus settled the Lords are returning home again very well satisfied  I am told by a good Hand from  Whitehall  That Sir  Gabriel Sylvius  being returning for  Holland  is charged with a Message from the  King to the Prince of  Orange  That the King considering the ill Circumstances that Prince had put himself into the King had writ late∣ly to the Prince to assure him of his Kindness and that he would do all he could to support him To which the Person that writes tells me that the Prince of  Orange  returned a very cold and indifferent Answer and which is much wondered at that the Prince should shew such Kindness to the Duke of  Monmouth  and the Lord  Brandon  which neither the King nor Duke can take well from the Prince I am told from the same Hand That the King had taken Notice to the Envoy of  Brandenburgh  of the great Respect and Kindness which is shewed to the Duke of  Monmouth  at  Berlin  and his Majesty was pleased to say he did not think the Elector would have given that Coun∣tenance to one that was in his Disfavour But the Minister to excuse the Elector said his Electoral Highness in the Respect he had shewed to the Duke of  Monmouth  did it as to his Majesty's Son and not to him as Duke of  Monmouth  who is so highly caressed at the  Hague  that it is thought the Prince will make him General of all the  English  Forces and of all other his Majesty's Subjects that are in the States Service with which his Majesty is so highly dissatisfied that perhaps at Mr  Chud∣leigh  's Return to the  Hague  his Majesty's Re∣sentment may appear more publick  I am told there hath lately happened a very unlucky Accident at  Norwich  betwixt  Mr  Bedingfield  and Mr  Barney  the first a Man of a very good Estate and the other an ancient Baronet and some Words having passed between them at a Gentleman's House  Barney  came behind  Bedingfield  and stabbed him in the Back of which he died presently The Sessions being then there he was tryed con∣victed and condemned and was executed at the Market Cross the Fact being so foul that all Sollicitations for his Life were ineffectual I am told from  Whitehall  that the King had named Mr  Brisbane  late Secretary of the Ad∣miralty to go in Quality of his Majesty's En∣voy Extraordinary to the King of  Portugal  in the Room of Mr  Fanshaw  who was recalled but Mr  Brisbane  falling sick at  Windsor  is since dead  By Letters of the th of  August  I am told that the King had thought fit to re∣move the Earl of  Radnor  from the President∣ship of the Council his Majesty's Pleasure be∣ing therein signified to his Lordship by a Let∣ter from the Secretary of State with an Assurance of the King's entire Satisfaction in his Services and that his Majesty as a Mark of it would continue to him his Pension which he had as Lord President The Lord  Radnor  's Answer was full of Duty and Sub∣mission to the King who was so well pleased with it that he ordered the Lords of the Trea∣sury to take particular Care of the Payment of the said Pension And his Majesty caused the Earl of  Rochester  to be sworn Lord Presi∣dent  of the Council and also acquainted the Lords that his Intention was that Mr  Godol∣phin  should be made an  English  Baron by the Name of Baron  Godolphin  of  Godolphin  and succeed the Lord  Rochester  in the Place of First Commissioner of the Treasury That the Earl of  Middleton  late one of the Secretaries of State of  Scotland  should succeed Mr  Godolphin  in that of Secretary of State of  England  who was sworn accordingly and that the King had given the Earl of  Rochester  Sixteen Thousand Pounds to be raised out of the Lord  Grey  's Estate Which Changes were made by the King to the Satisfaction of all Parties concerned  I was told from a good Hand at  Whitehall  that the Duke of  Grafton  was gone incognito into  Holland  and would from thence go to  Brussels  to meet with his Brother the Duke of  Northumberland  and then return together after having seen the Governour of  Flanders  and spoken with the Resident at  Brussels  which they both did but could not perform what they intended The same Person told me that the Discovery made in  Scotland  by the decy∣phering of  Argyle  's Letters which were owned by his Secretary are of great Importance which make the late horrid Conspiracy so evi∣dent that none can doubt of it It seems this Secretary was Prisoner in  Scotland  and was charged with a Letter from  Argyle  which was found about him when he was taken and a Person at  Edinburgh  did decypher it The Se∣cretary at first denied it but after having se∣veral  times endured the Torture called the  Boot  he had at last owned the Letter to be truly de∣cyphered and confessed several Particulars which make the Conspiracy as plain as NoonDay Upon this Discovery the Laird of  Monroe  and several others are apprehended in  Scotland  and  Monroe  being threatened with the Torture hath confessed all and hath con∣firmed what was evidenced by others designing to make an Insurrection in  Scotland  at the same time it was to be in  England Monroe  is bring∣ing up to  London  having made a very large Confession He hath attempted with the Hor∣ror of his Guilt to destroy himself and there∣fore is looked after more closely After this  Monroe  's Arrival  Argyle  's Letters and the Confession of his Secretary and others will be made publick to convince World of the hellish Designs of the Conspirators against the King and Government Tho' one would think there should be none that needs be convinced after the plain Proofs that have already been given of them It appears that the Design of the Conspirators was to have surprized  Berwick  and thereby to have opened their Way to  New∣castle  where the Plot hath been also discove∣red For the Lord Chief Justice  Jeffries  being upon the Bench Information was given him that several considerable Persons of that Town had signed an Association for reforming the Abuses of the Government in Church and State That the Original of this Association was burnt upon Discovery of the Plot against  the King and Duke But a Copy was produced to the Lord Chief Justice and one that signed the Original swore it to be a true Copy Up∣on which Sixteen or Seventeen principal Per∣sons of that Place were apprehended and com∣mitted to Prison for High Treason before the Assizes were there ended and since the Lord Chief Justice  Jeffries  's Return he hath given an Account thereof to the King As also that many Corporations in his Circuit had submit∣ted their Charters to such Alterations as his Majesty hath thought necessary for securing the Government in good and loyal Hands The City of  York  as well as  London  is now governed by Commission their Charter being seized into the King's Hands who out of his natural Goodness will grant them new Char∣ters A  Quo Warranto  being sent down against the Charter of the City of  Exeter  they imme∣diately resolved to lay their Charter at the King's Feet and to make such a Resignation thereof as his Majesty shall think fit By which may be seen the general Duty of his Majesty's Sub∣jects to his Royal Authority A great Change in few Months which next to the good Provi∣dence of God is to be attributed to his Maje∣sty's great Prudence and Conduct  The Lord Chief Justice  Jeffries  being re∣turned from his Circuit is gone to  Winchester  to lay at his Majesty's Feet several Charters that were surrendered to him in his Circuit where most Corporations have submitted to his Majesty's good Pleasure therein Their Ma∣jesties  are returned from  Winchester  and their Royal Highnesses with the Prince and Princess of  Denmark  the Day before the King and Duke since the Discovery of the Conspiracy never travelling the same Day together  This Week Mr  Rosewell  a Nonconformist Preacher was committed to  Newgate  having uttered treasonable Words as he was holding forth in a Conventicle He will not be tryed at the  Old Baily  but at the King's Bench Bar the next Term The Words he is charged with are very seditious and treasonable and as well against the late King as the present Government and are proved by so many Witnesses that he is like to pass his Time very ill  I must not forget to tell that upon Mr Se∣cretary  Jenkins  's laying down with the King's Leave his being Principal Secretary of State I was then put into the Province of the Earl of  Sunderland  who wrote me this following Letter dated the th of  August  at  Windsor  SIR  HIS Majesty was yesterday pleased to de∣clare in Council That he had given the Earl of  Radnor  Lord President of the Council Leave to retire in Consideration of his great Age That he was so well satisfied with his Ser∣vices that he intended to continue his Pension to him as Lord President and that he was resol∣ved to make the Earl of  Rochester  Lord Presi∣dent of the Council and to put Mr Secretary  Godolphin  at the Head of the Treasury as first Commissioner and to make the Earl of  Middle∣ton  who was Secretary of State in  Scotland  to be Secretary of State in  England  who was sworn accordingly His Majesty did also declare That he did not make these Alterations out of any Dissatisfaction he being perfectly well plea∣sed with the good Services they had done him in their respective Stations And his Majesty does direct me to tell you that he deos not here∣by intend to make the least Change in the Me∣thod of his Affairs or the Measures he hath taken which have hitherto had all the Success th  t he could propose I have yours constantly the last are of the th and th Instant  I am Sir Your Humble Servant  SUNDERLAND  About this time the  Spanish  Ambassador in  England Don Pedro de Ronquillos  took an Occasion to speak with the King my Master in the Duke of  Monmouth  's Behalf by Order from the  Marquis de Grana  then Governour of the  Spanish Netherlands  which produced a Letter from the King to the Marquis which was sent to me to deliver wherein his Majesty let the Marquis know how much he was dis∣satisfied with the Duke of  Monmouth  's Com∣portment which I represented to his Excellen∣cy in the best Terms I could But the  Marquis de Grana  told me he knew from whence the King's Displeasure came and that it was the Duke of  York  who was the great Enemy of the Duke  of  Monmouth  whom the King loved as he did his Eyes and endeavoured to perswade me to shew the Duke of  Monmouth  great Civilities I told his Excellency that I was absolutely to obey my Master who had commanded me not to own him and at the same time had spoken to  Don Pedro  to represent to the King of  Spain  his Master in what ill Circumstances the Duke of  Monmouth  stood with the King his Father  It was a strange Ingratitude in the Duke of  Monmouth  who was in quiet Possession of all Places of Trust Profit or Honour which could make him either happy or serviceable for the Government or grateful to the People to be engaged in a Conspiracy which was against Religion Morality and the common Sense of Humanity and the highest Ingratitude to the King his Father and even to Heaven it self Certainly this counterfeit  Absalom  took a Glo∣ry to exceed in Wickedness that no Man should be so infamous as himself who with the Gracefulness of his Person with his Po∣pularity and other sinister and base Artifices had strangely insinuated himself amongst the worst of Men the common People and be∣fore the Conspiracy broke out he made some Voyages into the Country and addressed him∣self to the Populace like another  Absalom  which went to his Royal Father's Heart His rebellious Son  Absalom  who was no sooner gone from his Father's Presence but he endea∣voured to steal away the Hearts of his People and alienate the Affections of his Subjects from  their Obedience His ambitious Son whom no Preferments could content His ungrateful Son with his artificial Submission at his Fa∣ther's Feet but was no sooner gone from his Presence but denied all he had confessed And yet his royal and indulgent Father was willing to forget  forgive all his Faults if he would but confess and acknowledge what he had done But  Benefacere malum audire  regium est  It is too often the ill Fortune of Kings to be ill spoken of when they do best for their Sub∣jects Good For after our bloodthirsty  English  Rebels had murdered their late King and brought the Nation to great Confusion which continued for some Years when God was mi∣raculously pleased to restore them to their an∣cient Government by sending them their own King Yet were the People so ungrateful that in place of praising God for so great a Benefit like the ancient  Jews  they complained and murmured at that very Time when God was leading them into the Land of Promise into Peace and Plenty they wished themselves back in  Egypt  whining after their Leeks and Oni∣ons and desiring their former Slavery Even so at this time Conventicles by their leering Whines and their melting Complaints insinu∣ated the sad Times that were coming even the Coffeehouses croaked with the Noise of it and there came out every Day some compleat Arti∣fice in Print such as the  Popish Counsellour Julian  Now when People's Heads are once actuated with such Hurricanes of Jealousies and  Fears and that their Religion Properties and Liberties are pulling down what can stop their Rage from attempting or believing any thing that is most unreasonable and contradi∣ctory to the Sense of their own Good The People at this time were soon overperswaded to entertain Fears of the Loss of that Liber∣ty of which no Nation under Heaven was more secure and yet Men were so befooled to undertake that which would certainly bring them to Tyranny and Slavery And from hence this King  Charles  II felt the Rage of that rebellious Faction in the House of Com∣mons which endeavoured to make his Majesty cheap abroad and contemptible at Home by arraigning the Justice of his Government and exciting a Hatred of the King's Person and did infest the Nation with Swarms of pestilent Libels which like Locusts overspread the Land poisoned the Minds of the People and drowned all the little Remains of Duty Alle∣giance Civility and common Honesty offering to remove from the King the very Guards of his royal Person by precluding the Advantage he might take of his own Revenues by their unwarrantable and unreasonable Votes which exposed his Majesty to all Dangers that might happen by endeavouring to deprive him of the Possibility of supporting the Government by running down the King and all his loyal Sub∣jects to the late woful or worser Evils and Events to which the rebellious Senate of had brought the Nation  Now when such a Number of discontented People are assembled pretending their Religion is in Danger this does influence them to the highest Resolution of acting be the Attempts never so hazardous and we may very well re∣member that Religion Liberty and Property were lost and gone when Monarchy by the Long Parliament was taken away and could never be revived till Monarchy was most hap∣pily restored and if this Conspiracy had suc∣ceeded we had been worse than ever About this time we heard every Day new Stories of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Govern∣ment with many scurrilous Reflections upon the King and if any Man durst shew his Fi∣delity to the Monarchy by opposing their An∣timonarchical Principles he was presently blasted with the Name of a Court or a Church Papist How unwarrantable were the Procee∣dings and seditious Votes of the House of Com∣mons and their pragmatical intermeddling with the Succession a Thing top sacred to be tou∣ched by their unhallowed Hands it being the Belief of all good as well as learned Men that no Power under Heaven can hinder the Descent of the Crown upon the next Heir of the Blood which is his unalterable Right by Religion Law History and Reason Yet the House of Commons resolved against it and would not be undeceived by undeniable Arguments Nay they voted they would make his Majesty a Glorious King with a better Revenue than any of his Predecessors by taking away all his  kingly Power so that he should not be able to support his Friends or suppress his Enemies Nay they voted That whosoever should lend the King any Money upon the several Branches of his Revenue should answer it in Parliament whereby they not only took away all Hopes of necessary Supplies but tied the Hands of the King's faithful Subjects and would have redu∣ced him to a more helpless Condition than the meanest of his Subjects And they assumed a Power to themselves of suspending Acts of Par∣liament by resolving that the Prosecution of Dissenters upon the Penal Laws was grievous to the Subject and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom and nothing would serve these illnatured Gentlemen but a total Exclusion of his Royal Highness's succeeding to the Crown to which the King had often and positively told them he could neither in Honour Conscience or Justice consent and yet instead of advan∣cing his Majesty's Honour and Greatness they persisted resolute in what they demanded When the King saw they went so fast he thought it high Time to prorogue them which he did several times in hopes of their agreeing at last but they were still so unhappy as not to agree which rendered the Friendship of  England  unsafe to trust to and which made our warlike wary Neighbours take other Resoluti∣ons whereby we gratified our Enemies and discouraged our Friends by our unseasonable Disputes And indeed the Calling of Parlia∣ments does sometimes great Hurt when more  Men are called together than can be united in Affections and Interests and they rather break into Factions than join in publick Interest from whence have risen those dangerous Facti∣ons which ruined the Peace and Happiness of our Nation  Sovereign Princes as ours in  England  have ever been God's Vicegerents upon Earth deri∣ving their Power and Authority from him alone who hath delegated Part of his own Power to Kings and stampt his own Character upon them and therefore we are never to speak rudely to them nor design any Evil against them And the primitive Fathers often acknow∣ledged the Heathen Emperors to be constituted by God and to hold their Empire from him only and to have God only above them And therefore in the early Ages of the Church the Doctrine of Questioning the supreme Ma∣gistrate was unknown and there was no such thing as Rebellion in the first Centuries of the Church and whatsoever the Forms of Govern∣ment were which differ according to the Cu∣stoms of their Country yet the Power and Au∣thority it self is derived from God and never received of the People in Trust nor is the sovereign Power answerable to the People for the Administration of it But when Men pre∣sume to think that the King is the People's Creature deriving his Power and Trust from them they will implead the King's Authority as a conditional and precarious Thing and upon the least Distrust will meditate a Revocation  of their Trust so that whatsoever is done the King must answer for it So apt are resty Men to clamour against their own Happiness and to promote the Steps of their own Ruine  Solo∣mon  who was a great and a wise King had some Hundreds of strange Wives contrary to the Law of  Moses  and by reason of them he fell to Idolatry yet neither Priest nor People took up Arms against him but left it to God who is the proper Judge of Kings who in the Time appointed by his divine Providence raised up  Jeroboam  to chastise him in his Son  I know  Calvin  says That the Magistrates or any Part of the Realm may resist the King being an Idolater as  Jehu  revolted from  Joram  when he forsook God Nay he says farther the Government of the Kingdom is not given to the King alone and that there is a Stipulation in all hereditary Kingdoms As in  France  when the King is crowned the Bishops of  Bauvais  and  Lyons  ask the People if they desire and command this Man to be King But surely  Calvin  forgot that he was born at  Noyon  in  Picardy  and that this is no Argument that they chose him to be King much less that they make him such For this is an Acceptation only and not an Electi∣on a Declaration of their willing Subjection and nothing else the Kingdom was confessed before to be hereditary and the Succession was determined by Law The Kings of  England  and  France  count the Time of their Reign from their Entrance to the Crown And was not  Henry  VII several Years before he was crowned  The Peers are  Pares inter se  but not Compa∣nions to the King In  England  all the Power and Authority depends upon the King and the State is nothing but the Authority of the King who is the Fountain whence springs all Au∣thority and Nobility He summons the great Council the Parliament and dissolves them when he pleases And he that would restrain Sovereignty within any narrower Bounds or communicate it to others makes no Difference between the Crown of a King and the Bonnet of a Duke of  Venice  I know  Buchanan  says Princes may be deposed by the People if they be Enemies to God and his Truth and that their Subjects are freed from their Oaths and their Obedience and that the People are above the King and of greater Authority than he The Case of the idolatrous  Iraelites  was plain the People acted nothing but by the Command of  Moses  who was supreme Magistrate neither did he command any thing to be done but from the Mouth of God according to the express Law  Deuteronomy    This is not to put the Sword into the Peo∣ple's Hands and to permit them to execute their fiery Zeal upon whom they please under Pre∣tence of rooting out Superstition especially such as no Man judges so but themselves Per∣secution in Matters of Religion is not the best Way to advance Religion which is the Judg∣ment of wise and learned Men even of Pro∣testants and better than any can be shewed for the contrary  Osiander  says That God doth  not allow that Hereticks should be punished with Death and forbids Magistrates to execute any such Authority And  Calvin  was of the same Opinion till he was settled in Power at  Geneva  For before he was much for Liber∣ty of Conscience and of the same Judgment was  Melancton  and many other learned Prote∣stants as  Cassander Grotius  and many other of the middle Temper The Cantons of  Switzer∣land  agree well in temperate things and does not the famous Kingdom of  Poland  tolerate Di∣versity of Religions and the great Emperor of  Muscovy  does the same What Reason can be given by indifferent Men why the Policy of  England  should be so singular and so differing from that of all other Christian Kingdoms and Nations about her Why should the  English  Government be more severe in this Point than that of our Neighbours It may seem some∣thing to reflect upon the Honour of our Na∣tion to mention the  Turk  in this Case yet certainly it cannot be denied but that Christi∣ans live quietly in the  Turk  's Dominions and upon Conditions so easy that the Catholicks in  England  would be well contented with the like who by the Grace of God have and would de∣mean themselves as loyally in all Points as not to attempt any thing offensive to the State or prejudicial to the publick Peace There is nothing in the Catholick Religion inconsistent with Loyalty and Catholicks are in Truth better Subjects than Protestants have shewed themselves to be generally speaking conside∣ring  their Principles Can any Man deny but that there was a most horrid Rebellion carried on by Protestants in  England  And the Catholicks hope that having always wished well to his Majesty's Title and prayed for his happy Succession to his Kingdoms that their so long tried Fidelity will at last procure them some Liberty and Refreshment I know  Calvin  says they are out of their Wits who desire to live under Sovereign Monarchies and says Order and Policy must needs decay where one Man holds such an Extent of Government And Kings says he oftentimes forget they are Men and they are styled  Dei gratiâ  for no other Purpose but to shew that they acknow∣ledge no Superior upon Earth and that they usually make Choice of such Counsellours as can best fit their Humours and accommodate themselves to their Appetites So that he ma∣keth Kings nothing the better for having Coun∣sellours whom he stains with an intolerable Scandal And  Buchanan  says St  Paul  com∣mands Obedience to Princes in the Infancy of the Church and if he had lived at this Time he would have said otherwise But as it is said  Nullum unquam magnum ingenium sine aliqua mixtura insaniae  so  Buchanan  was a highsoaring Wit and had some Tincture of Phrenzy For had he been perfectly sound he would never have let slip such a  Hysteron Pro∣teron  as this from his Pen And  Knox  in his History of  Scotland  not only justifies what  Buchanan  says but would be content that  there were publick Rewards appointed for such as murder Tyrants as there are for such as kill Wolves which is a most pernicious Doctrine fit for nothing but to encourage a  Ravilliac  or a  Poltrat Calvin  who writes in the Quality of a Divine in his Institutions makes a  Nebuchadnezar  of all Kings that he might not come short of his Predecessor  Martin Luther  I confess Princes once dispossessed seldom recover their Hold again There is none will deny but that it is necessary the Government of all Princes should be regulated by Laws and that Persons in Authority do observe those Rules that are prescribed to them by those to whom that Power belongs I pretend not to enhance the Authority of Princes so far as to exempt them from the Rule of Law or to make them arbitrary in their Government But when it is said  Vos estis Dii  they are justly established in the supreme Authority and when  I have said Ye are Gods  surely it was inten∣ded rather to teach the World a Lesson of Obe∣dience than Rebellion and Kings by those Words are justly established by divine Provi∣dence in the same Authority and exempted from any popular Cognizance It's proper on∣ly for God to say  Transferam Regna de Gente in Gentem  The Translating of Kingdoms is the extraordinary Dispensation of divine Pro∣vidence for Reasons known to God's secret Wisdom And tho' this be done by the Hands of Men yet are not the common People licen∣sed thereby to run upon any irregular Designs  of their own Head and to take Revenge of their Governours St  Paul  commands every Soul to pay Obedience and Honour to  Nero  who was God's Lieutenant upon Earth and had the Image of God upon him that is God's Authority and was therefore to be used with due Honour and Reverence When  Julian  of a Christian Emperor became Apostate and persecuted the Christians with great Cruelty tho' the People sharply reproved and inveighed against his Proceedings yet none of them took up Arms against him to depose him of Domi∣nion or Life and if they thought it not expe∣dient to do so against a Tyrant who only acted by his exorbitant Passions how much less would they have thought it lawful to be done against such Princes as govern legally and do nothing against Religion We must know that Kings are to be considered in a double Ca∣pacity of Nature and of Policy The Body Politick never dies and so is never defective of Authority The Acts of the Body Politick are not abated by the Natural Body's Access the Body Politick is not disabled to govern by the Nonnage of the Natural So in the th of Queen  Elizabeth  the Leases of the Dutchy of  Lancaster  made by King  Edward  VI were resolved by all the Judges to be good tho' made in the King's Minority For tho' the King's Body Natural cannot judge yet that disables not that the Acts of his Minority ordered by his Council or Regent should be of no Vali∣dity The Parliament certainly would not take  it well if a Catholick should affirm that the Change of Religion made by King  Edward  VI was not warrantable being done in his Mino∣rity when he had not Age to discern what he did being in the Hands of the Protector and  Northumberland  But suppose the King breaks his Coronation Oath may not many things happen after his Oath taken to excuse him from Perjury By Law every Oath how absolute soever hath always this necessary Condition annexed tacit∣ly  viz Rebus sic stantibus  that things remain as they were when the Oath was taken But if such Alterations which make either the Oath or Promise impossible or unlawful to be per∣formed a Man doth not then commit Perjury that breaks his Oath or Promise What if that which the King at his Inauguration pro∣mised for the Good of his People cannot be observed without great Damage to them If the Condition of Affairs be so changed Reso∣lutions upon them must also change Dr  Bil∣son  a great Divine and a great Prelate of the Church of  England  and chosen on Purpose by the great Statesmen of his Time to write  Cum Privilegio  puts the Question Whether a King shall be deposed for breaking his Coro∣nation Oath And he answers in the Negative and gives this Reason  The People may not break with their Prince so often as he breaks with God For  says he  Subjects cannot depose their Prin∣ces to whom they must be subject for Conscience sake  which Doctrine is quite contrary to what  is now taught And farther Dr  Bilson  says That  Subjects are forbidden to take Arms against their Princes  the Reason hereof he says is invincible  For to him that may Kill and War against a Prince Killing him is of Consequence inevitable The Apostle  saith he  obeyed Ty∣rants that commanded all things against Reli∣gion and in those things they did submit them∣selves with Meekness to endure the Magi∣strate's Pleasure and not to obey his Will  And he concludes  That if the Laws of the Land appoint the Nobles as next the King to assist him in doing right and to withold him from do∣ing wrong then they are licensed by Man's Law to interpose themselves but in no Case to deprive the Prince where the Scepter is inherited  It is most manifest that this Spirit of Refor∣mation hath ever been and is most dangerous to those Princes and States where it gets Foot∣ing This was it which begat so many Conspi∣racies against Queen  Mary  So that more Prin∣ces have been deposed and persecuted by Pro∣testants their Subjects upon the Difference of Religion than have been by the Practices of any Catholick Subjects in any time before Queen  Mary  's Days for Six Hundred Years But we will send them to Doctor  Bilson  a great Divine of their own Church who holds it an Article of Faith that Princes were not to be deposed which was good Doctrine in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  tho' it was not thought so in the Reign of Queen  Mary  who reigned not much above Five Years and yet had more Insur∣rections  raised against her in that small Time than Queen  Elizabeth  had from the Catholicks in Forty Five Years and yet Queen  Mary  was very merciful and shewed much Compassion to such as deserved not well of her To the Dutchess of  Somerset  to Sir  John Clarke  who had been a principal Corrupter of King  Edward  her Brother's Infancy to the Lord Chief Ju∣stice  Montague  who both counselled and sub∣scribed to her Disinheriting and to many others who were attainted that neither affected her Religion nor Title and were then Priso∣ners in the  Tower  and yet she released them all And for all this the Zealots of her Time would not suffer her to enjoy any Quiet but murmured against the Government of Women and did conspire and plot her Deprivation out of a Desire to advance her Successor under whom they expected a golden Age And  Knox  then said the Nobility Magistrates and Judges and the whole People of  England  were bound in Conscience not only to oppose the Proceedings of that  Jezabel Mary  but even to have killed her and all her Priests with her  After the Death of this Queen her Sister  Elizabeth  came to the Crown and the whole Christian World stood amazed at such a sudden Alteration and the rather because Religion had been so lately and so solemnly restored by Parliament Also the Queen that now was had always professed her self a Catholick du∣ring the Reign of her Sister and did constantly  hear Mass and went often to Confession and in open Parliament after her Intention for a Change in Religion began to be discovered she used Policy at least for she assured the  Roman  Catholicks that no Trouble should arise to them for any Difference in Religion which did much abate the Opposition that otherwise might probably have been made by the Catho∣lick Party and put the Clergy themselves in Hopes of some fair Quarter under her Govern∣ment She knew well that a Prince alone how sovereign soever could not establish a new Religion in this Kingdom without a Parlia∣ment to give Authority and Countenance to it and therefore to win the Bishops and the rest of the Catholicks in Parliament to Silence at least she was content to use Policy with them and promise them fair and she also thought good to qualify the Style somewhat from  Su∣preme Head  changing it into  Supreme Gover∣nour  which altered not the Sense yet it abu∣sed some into a Belief that the Queen preten∣ded not much in Matters Ecclesiastical as the King her Father had done who was  Flagelium Dei  the Scourge of God to the Church of  England  and the first King in our Nation that ever tried the admirable Patience Obedience and Loyalty of his Catholick Subjects  Nicephorus Phocas  the Emperor was the nearest Parallel to this King that we meet with in all the Ecclesiastical History for he resu∣med all Donations that had been made unto Monasteries and Churches in his Time but  such Afflictions followed him ever after that  Basilius  his Successor who was none of the best Emperors was yet careful to abrogate those Laws of  Phocas  among his first Acts as the Root of all the Calamities of those Times Nor did any better Success attend King  Harrie  's Impieties His exorbitant Lusts which were the Original of all the Mischiefs which the Nation suffered became at last his Torments No King was ever more necessitated in Point of Treasure in very few Years after that immense Treasure left him by his royal Father Never did King lay more heavy Taxes upon his Sub∣jects and never any King did use more ignoble and unprincely Ways to raise Money and to shew God's great Displeasure against him he was frustrated of that which was pretended to be his chiefest Design  viz  Succession and Issue All his noble Stems and Branches were taken away one after the other without Issue and his Crown translated to another Name and Na∣tion God suffering him as a blind Man to err and wander in all his Courses and all the great Treasure which he had raked together upon the Ruine of the Church was all spent in Excess and Vanity and not to any Honour of the Kingdom nor Ease of his Subjects or Maintenance of the Borders or Relief of the Poor all which were at first mainly pretended but at last all was employed in Tiltings Masks and Mummeries and in pleasing and inviting his Mistresses and to satisfy the greedy Appe∣tites of those Sollicitors of his Lust And when  the King had thus wearied his Subjects with a long and inglorious Reign and that he found his Soul as much oppressed with the Guilt of his Sins as his Body was become unweildy thro' his excessive Intemperance he died as some say desirous to repent and be reconciled to the Church but what Effect his Desires had is only known to God And yet the Catho∣licks took all patiently raised no Tumults or Insurrections but were Examples of the true  Israelites  and did imitate in some Measure their divine Master's Meekness and resolved rather to undergo God's just Punishment in the King's great Injustice than to shew themselves like so many  Lutherans  or  Calvinists  and had only the true Christian Arms of Prayers and Tears by Submission to God's Will  Kings indeed ought to consider that God hath placed them over his People as Examples to give Countenance to their Laws by their own strict Observation of them and that as their Subjects are to be protected by their Prin∣ces so they are to be assisted and supported by each other the Function of Kings being an Order by it self and the Rebellion of Sub∣jects ought to be looked upon by all other Kings as an Assault upon their own Sovereignty and in some Degree a Design against Monarchy it self and consequently to be suppressed in what Kingdom soever it is with the like Concern∣ment as if it were in their own Bowels And all foreign Ministers who ought to have been highly concerned for the Murder of K  Charles  I  by his merciless Rebels and to have vindica∣ted that royal Blood did scarce murmur at it but made haste to send over their Emissaries to get a Share in the Spoils of a murdered Prince And yet not one of those Monarchs and Prin∣ces which bought all the costly Pictures and rich Hangings and Furniture ever restored any of their unlawful Purchases to the King after his most happy Restoration 'Tis true the then King of  Spain  expressed a very tender Sense of our King's Sufferings and said it concerned all Kings to join together for Pu∣nishment of such an impious Rebellion and cruel Parricide whilst his own Abmbassador  Don Alonzo de Cardinas  then in  England  not only countenanced and joined with the Parlia∣ment but bought the greatest and best Part of all the rare Pictures and rich Moveables which he sold in  Spain  at great Rates And whilst he was in  Flanders  he gave Count  Fuensaldagna  a false Relation of the  English  Affairs assuring him that the  English  Monarchy would never again be restored and when it happened he was laughed at by all However it is certain that whilst that great Impostor  Cromwell  lived his Power at Home was nothing considerable to what it was Abroad For  France Spain Hol∣land  and all the neighbouring Princes feared him to that Degree that there was nothing he could have demanded of them that they would have denied him  No Man can deny but that many wellmean∣ing Men were seduced by the disguised Designs  of that mysterious Age and by those Villains who always had in their Aim to destroy Mo∣narchy and unhinge the whole Frame of Go∣vernment and the sober Party were cozened by the Artifices of that loathsome Hypocrite  Cromwell  Till at last they were inspired with a Resolution to redeem themselves their Reli∣gion and Liberties which were treacherously taken from them by Deceit and Fraud and to free themselves from the miserable Yoke they lay under when they plainly saw that Reli∣gion Reformation and Liberty were only deceitful Baits to draw in the deluded Multi∣tude But still their most hopeful Designs not being carried on with that Prudence and Pre∣caution which was necessary they were always discovered and did rather settle and confirm than weaken the Rebellion till that overru∣ling Hand of Providence which guides and determines the Affairs of the whole World was most visibly seen in his Majesty's most happy Restoration  It is no new thing for the worst of Men to make use of the sacred Name of Religion to palliate their abominable Undertakings The Ruine of pious Kings and Princes the Over∣turning all Order in the World the tragical Transactions of the last Age the Convulsions of State the Commotions of the People the many Changes and Overturnings of Governours and Governments were the sad Effects of the pretended Reformation and all these Mischiefs were usher'd in with the Lamblike harmless  Voice of Religion They came indeed in Sheeps Cloathing who inwardly were ravening Wolves Some Mens Religion inclines them to Faction and there is none to dangerous Faction as that which is nourished by the Corruption of false Religion The  Jewish  Zealots and the  English  Enthusiasts are a plain Example of it and therefore when Men make great Pretences and begin to talk factiously a fair Opportunity is very like to make them Rebels And those who have seen what the Event of those Actions were in the Years of and when they saw the same things acted over again and even by some of the same Men they might easily and certainly expect the same Events And if Men had seriously observed this the same Men would never have played over the same Game twice in the same Age which obliged the then Lord Chancellor to take Notice of it in his Speech to both Houses of Parliament That he hoped they would not see three Kingdoms quite de∣stroyed twice in one Age by the same Methods telling them when Men were in their Wits they would not fall into the same Pit in which they had seen others fall before them when even Beasts will not do it let the Bait be what it will But alas many of those who were the principal Makers of the first were so far from falling into it that they were the chiefest Diggers of the second Pit in which so many had fallen And we were then come to that Pass that it was an unpardonable Crime for any Man to look as if he thought the Cry of  Popery  was false  and made a Property only as it then really was to serve some Mens Ends and Designs  It was a great Fault in King  Charles  I at least a great Weakness in him to divest him∣self of the Power of dissolving the Long Par∣liament which was a just Prerogative belong∣ing to him And tho' the Parliament then said that should not encourage them to do any thing which otherwise was not fit for them to do yet they soon invaded the publick Liberty and they who said they had no Mind to be Slaves were yet willing to be Tyrants themselves and would admit no Rules to govern by but their own Will not considering the Misery of  Athens  was at the highest when it was governed by Thirty Tyrants And therefore the wisest Course of Princes is frequently to summon Parliaments and seasonably to dissolve them after their applying Cures to those Diseases they had discovered whereby they would be of great Esteem to the Crown as well as Veneration with the People and not let them sit any longer lest they should fall into Factions and pretend to find Grievances where there are none And if King  Charles  II had lived some Years longer he had certainly brought them to that Pass and preserved  England  from the Distractions that have since followed which his Majesty foresaw and which caused him to make those frequent Intervals of Parliaments And yet his Majesty declared unto them That none of his Predecessors ever had a greater Esteem for Parliaments the King believing  them to be the vital Part of the Constitution of the Kingdom and so necessary for the Govern∣ment of it that neither Prince nor People could be happy without them and looked up∣on their Counsels as the best he could receive and was as tender of their Privileges and as careful to preserve and protect them as of his own royal Authority knowing that all good Subjects would be jealous of any thing that might infringe or impair his royal Authori∣ty his own Interest being entirely bound up with that of his Subjects But they should consider that Parliament Men sit as Subjects not as Superiors and that they are called to be the King's Counsellours not Dictators their Summons being only to recommend their Advice not to command They should be wise dispassionate good Patriots to raise up those Banks and Fences which were cast down by Rebellion in Hopes that the same Prosperi∣ty should spring up again from those Roots which it did heretofore and hath always grown tho' it was very hard to redeem our Nation from the Infamy it had undergone and to restore it to all it had lost and to make the King and People as happy as they ought to be and there was nothing that the Parliament could propose for the Happiness of the King∣dom in which the King did not contend with them to compass the King not being only wil∣ling but desirous to gratify his People by se∣curing their Religion Liberties and Properties by as many good Laws as the Parliament  would propose He was absolutely determined to do all that in him lay to glad the Hearts of his People and gave them many Opportunities of providing for their Good and it could not be imputed to his Majesty that the Success did not answer his Expectation  The particular Causes of the King's Dissa∣tisfaction were such that what he recommen∣ded to the House of Commons to avoid they purposely fell into and tho' the King solemn∣ly promised to comply with any thing that would have been proposed for Security of the Protestant Religion as by Law established that might consist with preserving the Succession of the Crown in its due and legal Course of De∣scent Yet to all his Majesty's Offers he met with most unsuitable and most unwarrantable Returns The King would most willingly have consented to any Expedient by which the Pro∣testant Religion established might have been preserved and the Monarchy not destroyed But no Expedient would serve those illnatured Gentlemen of the House of Commons but the total Exclusion of the Duke of  York  which his Majesty had so often declared was a Point which in Honour Justice and Conscience he could not consent to When this Bill of Ex∣clusion was first set on Foot it was well said by a noble Person then in the House of Com∣mons That the King might outlive the Duke of  York  and then all they were doing would be unnecessary and why should they to pre∣vent that which might not be attempt to do  that which they could never justify either to the King or Country When the King found they went contrary to the direct Rules of Law that he was deceived by them and that the Follies and Imprudencies of the prevailing Par∣ty in the House of Commons some of which had given Birth and Growth to the Miseries of the last Age and were now pouring in Vinegar instead of Oil into the Wounds of the Nation and departed from that Fidelity which they owed the King and that Zeal which they should have shewed to his Service and that nothing would serve them of the same Leaven with those of but the total Exclusion of his Royal Highness succeeding to the Crown and had prepared an Act for it the King came in Per∣son to the House of Lords and sent for the Commons to attend him in the Year The King then spake roundly to them and told them how unsatisfied he was with their extra∣vagant Proceedings and desired to know spee∣dily how he should be assisted by them and what they desired from him assuring them in the Word of a King that he would concur to any thing for the Security of the Protestant Religion as it was established by Law but still upon the same Terms he had formerly proposed to them and that he would never do it other∣wise  But before the House of Commons went to the Lords where the King in his Robes ex∣pected them they passed those ensuing Votes That the only Way for suppressing of Popery  was that a Bill should be brought in to banish immediately all the considerable Papists in  Eng∣land  out of the King's Dominions That so long as the Papists had any Hopes of the Duke of  York  's succeeding to the Crown the King's Person the Protestant Religion the Lives Liberties and Properties of all his Ma∣jesty's Protestant Subjects were in apparent Danger to be destroyed They farther voted That a Bill should be brought in for an Asso∣ciation of all his Majesty's Protestant Subjects for the Safety of his Majesty's Person for De∣fence of the Protestant Religion against all Ty∣ranny and Oppression whatsoever and for pre∣venting the Duke of  York  or any Papist for succeeding to the Crown They did likewise declare That it was the Opinion that the Duke of  Monmouth  had been removed from his Offices and Commands by the Influence of the Duke of  York  and that an Address should be made to the King to restore the Duke of  Mon∣mouth  to his Offices and Commands and resol∣ved likewise just before the King being in his Robes had sent for them to the Lords House to prorogue them that whosoever advised the King to that Prorogation which they said was done on Purpose against Passing the Bill for Exclusion of the Duke of  York  was a Betrayer of the King the Protestant Religion the King∣dom of  England  a Promoter of the  French  Interest and a Pensioner of  France  They also voted at the same time That it was the Opinion of the House that the City of  London  was burnt by the Papists in thereby de∣signing to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Power Upon these extravagant insolent and disloyal Votes the King forthwith dissolved the Parliament  Now the strangest thing was that those who most pretended in the House of Commons for Reformation had a barefac'd Contempt and Distaste of all Religion whatsoever and not so much as the Shadow of Vertue Men of the most licentious Lives of the most seared Con∣sciences of the most profligate Reputation that had bid Defiance to all Religion and most di∣ligently cultivated Atheism and Profaneness It is indeed enough to move the most patient Man upon Earth to consider what Foreheads of Steel and Adamant those impious Wretches had who were thus confident to gull and im∣pose upon the People of  England  by seem∣ing Zeal for Religion and Reformation But such as rebel under Pretence of Religion are most dangerous to the Government they will pretend to defend the King's Person against Ca∣tholicks that themselves only might have the Honour of subverting the Government so hard a thing it is to cure one that is bewitched with the Principles of Rebellion that after many Years he shall return to his Trade as boldly as if his former Pranks had never been heard of Fear of Popery Arbitrary Government and evil Counsellours in my Memory since the Year made our  English  Nation run mad cost an infinite Treasure with the Lives of  some Thousand  English  and in Conclusion instead of Religion setting up Enthusiasm instead of Liberty the Nation was enslaved to a military Power instead of Property Plunder Sacrilege and Sequestration and they were just playing the same Game over again in this King's Time if by little less than a Miracle they had not been prevented And whosoever throws off his Allegiance to his Sovereign he renounces all Duty and Conscience towards God  The King calls a Parliament by his own Writ and Authority without which they cannot meet to give him faithful Counsel about his most weighty Affairs but he does not resign up his Interest and Freedom He never sub∣jects himself to their absolute Determination He always weighs their Counsels as coming from a Body entrusted by him and when he dissents from them he tells them the Reasons which prevailed with his Conscience and Un∣derstanding with that Candor that a Prince should do towards his Subjects A King should look upon his Parliament as his great Council to whose Advice he should always have Regard But a King should likewise look upon himself as neither deprived of his Understanding nor divested of any Right he had if there was no Parliament sitting The King's Power is un∣doubtedly very useful for his People's Liber∣ty and Parliaments ought not to set Bounds to their Princes and wise Princes will never de∣sire nor affect more Greatness or Prerogative  than what is really for the Good of their Subjects  The Truth is since the happy Restoration of our King his People were given up to too much Joy and Forgetfulness of our past Mise∣ries and there was not such a Return to God for his wonderful Blessings as was due to the great Giver of them and when we saw some Portion of that innocent royal Blood which was spilt recompensed upon some of their Heads who were the wicked Contrivers of that Parricide When the Miseries of our Na∣tion and the Sufferings of the Royal Family were all recovered by the unerring Hand of divine Providence without the Intervention of any foreign Prince many of the same Men joining in the Settlement of our distracted Na∣tion who had before been active in the De∣struction of their Country to shew how sensi∣ble they were of their former Errors and great Miscarriages it then manifestly appearing to them and all others who were not wilfully blind that the Bill of Exclusion was carried on with that Violence to facilitate the Dethro∣ning of the King and his Successor who had ventured his Blood as frankly both by Sea and Land in the Good of the Country as the meanest Subject in it and had manifested his unalterable Loyalty and Affection to his Ma∣jesty and his Subjects by reducing  Scotland  to Obedience whose Conduct in that Affair was both wise and prosperous  Now when the Nation had scarce wiped their Eyes dry for the Blood of the incompa∣rable Father they were ready to be drowned again in Tears for the Murder of the succeed∣ing Son if their Cruelty had been effected The Rage of those Rebels in the Long Parlia∣ment had only the Blood of one King for its Gratification but here the Rebels intended to have glutted their Thirst of Blood by mur∣thering Two at one Blow the King with his Royal Brother And to give their Inhumanity the highest Ascent they were preparing to murder a Prince whose august Majesty had not only enobled the Nation and once more resto∣red it from its lost Reputation abroad but made his own Kingdom as he then had Reason to think an Ark of Safety at home when almost all other Christian Nations were deluged in Blood and Confusion  Who would have imagined a Design should be laid to murder that King the Blood of whose Royal Father still cried for Vengeance Who would imagine that he who was restored almost by a Miracle when the People of  Eng∣land  ran chearfully into Obedience and met his Majesty with Duty and Love and received him with triumphant Hosanna's with many Protestations of Sorrow for their former Mis∣carriages and with many Vows of Loyalty and Obedience Who would have thought after so many Promises of making him a Glorious King After such Acts of Indemnity granted to such Monsters of Rebels After such Profusions  of royal Bounty to such undeserving Villains After so many Professions of the Care they would have for the Preservation of his sacred Life After so many specious Addresses of his most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects as they cal∣led themselves Who I say would imagine that after all this any Man could be found to conspire to murder his sacred Majesty As if all his Condescensions and Favours had been Injuries to make Reprisals upon his Life and then resolved to revenge his Death upon others when they were doing it themselves In the Bill of Exclusion the Duke of  York  was to be set aside for the King's Preservation but in this Plot the King was to be murdered for the Duke's sake and both King and Duke being taken in the same Dilemma after the Presbyterian Lo∣gick were to be sacrificed And had their Conspiracy taken Effect they would so far have extenuated the Matter that Cutting of Throats would only be called a  Scotch  Way of Trimming and the Destruction of the King and Duke to be no more but a perfecting the Work of entire Reformation And if this Con∣spiracy had succeeded it would have put an End to our national Constitution and a Period to the very Fundamentals of all human Society  I know no Deliverances come nearer to those of King  David  than those wonderful Delive∣rances of this King First from his Escape at  Worcester  and from so many  Sheba's  and  Achi∣tophels  which God from time to time wrought for him which perhaps no Age no State no  History can shew the like But this Conspiracy was the more terrible in that  Achitophel  was in the Head of it who had corrupted and debauched the counterfeit  Absalom Achitophel  that false and treacherous Villain that dextrous Man at Wickedness that cunning crafty Politician who had been President of the King's Council who was esteemed as an Oracle That hardened Trai∣tor who stole away that he might die in his Bed when it was Pity that such an inveterate and advising Rebel should have died any other Way than by the Hand of Justice which he had certainly done without an  Ignoramus Jury  when the highest Treason was formed by such working Heads and conducted by such poli∣tick Counsels for it was not only countenan∣ced and abetted by the  Faeces  of the People but was really incouraged by some of the No∣bility who had affronted his Majesty by Pe∣titioning Protesting and Caballing which gave the seditious Faction a full Assurance that they were powerful enough to overturn the Mo∣narcy their Design being to be executed by such desperate Villains that nothing less could be ex∣pected than the Kingdom's inevitable Ruine had not the King been miraculously preserved  But how shameful a thing was it that Per∣sons of Birth and Quality should condescend to be Tools and to creep in the Dust to humour a base unworthy disloyal Faction taken out of the Dregs of the People That they should endeavour to extinguish that Light from whence they derived their own Lustre and to shine  only by the Favour of an inconstant heady Mul∣titude and the King's Death however it hap∣pened was to be put upon the  Roman  Catho∣licks and those Rebels had a Person ready to take upon him the Government whose Pre∣sumption in the next Reign owning his false Title to the Crown brought him to end his Life upon a Scaffold instead of a Throne which he aimed at and if he had gained his Point he had entailed War and Blood to our unborn Posterity against which no Caution could certainly be too great nor against that Distemper from which we were so miraculously recovered when there was no Cause to fear the Loss of Religion Liberty and Property neither did they believe themselves who pre∣tended to be afraid of them The Moderation of a Prince was never more shewed than by this King who then suffered so much licenti∣ous Talk to pass unpunished and there ap∣peared fewer Grievances in his Time than had ever been before and  England  seemed never more happy than at this Time And it was a strange Ingratitude of those who seemed ill at Ease un∣der so temperate a Government who were yet so numerous in the House of Commons that they outvoted the best Men in it which made the King often prorogue them which proved fatal to his Successor tho' this King did all that was possible to keep his People in Peace whilst he lived and to leave them so when he died which puts me in Mind of a prophetical Saying of this King to me some Years before his Death  About two Years before the Death of King  Charles  II he gave me Leave to come into  England  and sent the  Katherine  Yacht to  Ostend  for me Some Days after my Arrival at  White∣hall  he commanded me to walk with him to  Hyde Park  and as I walked with him the rest of the Company keeping at a good Distance he told me that I had served him very well at  Brussels  and that his Brother had given him a very good Account of my Carriage towards him there His Majesty then told me that I had served him as Agent and Resident for many Years and tho' he constantly used to change his Ministers at least their Station every three Years that yet I had served him so much to his Satisfaction that he was resolved never to remove me from  Brussels  whilst he lived espe∣cially during the Wars in  Flanders  because I had always given him a very particular Account of them and that I knew that Country very well and the Interest of all the great Men in it and that I was there very well approved of and that my Diligence and Activity in his Ser∣vice had been very considerable in those trou∣blesome Times And after having asked me many Questions about the Nobility of those Countries he said that during his Exile abroad he had seen many Countries of which none pleased him so much as that of the  Fle∣mings  which were the most honest and true∣hearted Race of People that he had met with and then added  but I am weary of travelling I am resolved to go abroad no more But when  I am dead and gone I know not what my Bro∣ther will do I am much afraid that when he comes to the Crown he will be obliged to travel again And yet I will take Care to leave my Kingdoms to him in Peace wishing he may long keep them so But this hath all of my Fears little of my Hopes and less of my Reason and I am much afraid that when my Brother comes to the Crown he will be obliged again to leave his native Soil  This Discourse of the King's I have often remembered with much Grief and Sorrow which hath been true in all its Circumstances And certainly had this King loved Business as well as he understood it he had been the greatest Prince of his Time  Some time after my Return to  Brussels  in the Year I received this following Let∣ter from the Earl of  Sunderland  who was then Principal Secretary of State in whose Province I was dated  April    SIR  I Am commanded by his Majesty to let you know that in Case the Duke of  Monmouth  should come into  Flanders  he would not have you take any Notice of him and his Majesty would have you acquaint his Subjects in those Parts with the Directions I send you to the End they may likewise conform themselves to his Majesty's Pleasure in their Behaviour  I am Sir Your most Humble Servant  SUNDERLAND  About this time several  English  and  Scotch  Officers came daily to see me from the Prince of  Orange  's Camp then at  Dighnin  near  Brus∣sels  and some of them being very inquisitive to know what News I had from  England  the Time being then very critical I shewed them my Lord  Sunderland  's Letter to me which it seems had such Influence upon some of them that the next Day when the Duke of  Mon∣mouth  went from  Brussels  to the Prince of  Orange  's Camp which he did very frequently and the Prince of  Orange  had given a general Order that whenever the Duke of  Monmouth  entered the Camp the whole Army should stand to their Arms But that Day when the Duke entered the Camp some  English  and  Scotch  Of∣ficers did neither stand to their Arms as the Duke passed by them nor their Companies of which Neglect the Duke of  Monmouth  took particular Notice and complained to his High∣ness of their Neglect Whereupon the Prince forthwith sent for those Officers and sharply reprehended them for not obeying his Orders who thereupon told the Prince that the  English  Resident had given them Orders not to do it Whereat the Prince was very angry which being told me by some of the Officers I went the next Day with Intention to dine with the Prince and had my Lord  Sunderland  's Letter in my Pocket But when I came to the Prince's Quarters being informed that the Duke of  Monmouth  was there I thought not fit to stay  but dined with one of the  English  Collonels in the Camp and after Dinner I waited on the Prince and was conducted into his Closet where the Prince came presently and after usual Salutation his Highness asked me how I came to give Orders to the Officers of his Army not to stand to their Arms when the Duke of  Monmouth  entered his Camp I told the Prince that I never gave them any Orders That I had at their earnest Request shewed them a Letter I had newly received from my Lord  Sunderland  and that if his Highness pleased I would shew it him Whereupon he desired to see it and after reading it privately to himself he presently told me if I had done no more than shewed them the Letter I had done no more than my Duty and that it was the Fault of his Officers in not obeying his Commands That for the King of  England  he might do what he pleased in sending for his Officers and Soldiers none of which he would keep against their Wills but whilst they served him he pretended they should do their Duty and obey his Commands And so I took my Leave of the Prince without going into the other Room where the Duke of  Monmouth  Mr  Bentinck  and several General Officers were  The Sixth of  February  following which was in the Year I received this ensuing Letter from the Earl of  Sunderland  SIR  UPON  Monday  last his late Majesty was taken very ill by an Apoplectick Fit The next Day he was much better and continued so on  Wednesday  But after growing much worse yesterday his Distemper at length overcame him so that it pleased God to call him to him∣self this Day about Noon whereupon the Lords of the Council immediately assembled and Or∣der was given that his Majesty should be pro∣claimed which was done accordingly God grant him a long and prosperous Reign I am Sir  Your Affectionate Friend and Servant  SUNDERLAND  After this the th of  February  following I had this Letter from his Lordship  SIR  I Sent you an Account on  Friday  of the late King's Death and of the Proclaiming his present Majesty  James II  who commands me to tell you that he would have you continue your Function as his Minister and to pursue such Or∣ders and Instructions as have been hitherto given or sent you I am Sir  Your most Humble Servant  SUNDERLAND  The th of  April  following I had from  White∣hall  this ensuing Letter from the Earl of  Sun∣derland  SIR  I Have according to your Desire moved his Majesty for Leave for you to make a Step over hither which he is pleased to allow of but would not have your Stay here to be long As to the Time of your coming his Majesty leaves it to you and will send a Yacht to conduct you not doubting but that you will make use of this Permission so as that your Absence from your Sta∣tion may be no Prejudice to his Service I am Sir  Your Affectionate Friend and Servant  SUNDERLAND  I had another Letter from his Lordship dated at the Court at  Windsor August    SIR  HIS Majesty not having fully resolved yet what Style to give the present Governour of  Flanders  and thinking your Presence there to be very necessary commands me to signify to you that he would have you forthwith go to  Brussels  and be there  incognito  till such time as your Cre∣dentials are sent you You may excuse your not having your Credentials by saying you were dispatched in Haste and expect them every Day And if in the mean time the Governour of  Flanders  shall be willing to admit you as En∣voy his Majesty allows you to shew the Title of your private Instructions under his Majesty's own Hand which expresses the Character you have  I am Sir Your most Humble Servant  SUNDERLAND  Whilst I was in  England  the  Marquis de Grana  who was Governour General of the  Spanish Netherlands  being not well in his Health retired to  Marimont  in  Hennault  and after some Days Sickness he died there by a great Stoppage of Urine and  Don Antonio d'Agusto  who was then  Maitre de Camp Ge∣neral  of the Army was forthwith declared Governour  pro interim  wherein he behaved himself so well that by the Interest of the King my Master and of the Prince of  Orange  he was confirmed absolute Governour with all its Privileges and continued Governour for Six Years and was then outed of his Govern∣ment by the Interest of the Prince of  Orange  who was then more against him than his High∣ness was before for him for finding he was made  Marquis de Gastanaga  and that he had a great and private Veneration for King  James  II my Master the Prince of  Orange  thereupon used his utmost Endeavour to out him of the Government of  Flanders  and one of the Ar∣ticles which the Prince of  Orange  sent to  Ma∣drid  against the  Marquis de Gastanaga  was That he had held several private Conferences with me after the Prince of  Orange  had sent me Letters of Revocation from my Function of Envoy But the King my Master did not dis∣cover this till it was too late to remedy it the Prince of  Orange  being very averse to all that had any Veneration for my Master  James  II or that were Friends to his Majesty And that the  Marquis de Gastanaga  was his Majesty's  real tho' secret Friend may be seen by the Letters which he wrote to me whilst I was in  England  in the Duke of  Monmouth  's Rebel∣lion and after the Prince of  Orange  had dis∣charged me from my Employment he made Mr  Ekart  a  Switzer  his Resident at the Court of  Brussels  who dying soon after the Prince of  Orange  made Mr  Wolseley  his Envoy in the Court of  Brussels  where he continued for some Years but he was found to be a very lazy and unactive Man and gave no Satisfaction to the Elector of  Bavaria  who succeeded the  Marquis de Gastanaga  and continued Governour during the Life of the Prince of  Orange  since whose Death there hath been a great Change of Affairs by the Battle of  Ramillies  and most of  Flanders  is now reduced under the Government of the Archduke  Charles  Whilst I was with King  James  my Royal Master I received many Letters from  Don An∣tonio Agusto  who was then Governour  pro in∣terim  of the  Spanish Netherlands  by which it will appear how much he was in the Interest of the King my Master the first of which was of the th of  July    Monsieur  VOtre Lettre de me que j'ay receue aujour∣d'huy m'apporte deux differents sujets de joye l'un pour la part que vous avez bien vou∣lu
