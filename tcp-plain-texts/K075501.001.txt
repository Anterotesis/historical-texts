every one that time only and continual reading can add to the collection which makes every new edition more valuable than the last It has been the author's study to examine into the accuracy of dates and reconcile the difference of historians who vary in nothing more than in the times when events happened owing to different commencements of the year with different people The Jews began the year with the month of March the Athenians with June the Macedonians with the th of September the Christians of Egypt and Ethiopia with the th or th of August the Persians and Armenians with the th of the same month but most christians of the Western world reckon from the st of January Indeed from the Roman Conquest to Bede time seems to have been computed from Christmas day The Saxon chronicle begins the year from the birth of our Lord At the beginning of the th century some computed from the Annunciation some from the Nativity some from the Circumcision and others from the Passion of our Lord of course there was no fixed rule of computation in Gervase of Canterbury's time Matt Paris Matt Westminster Ralph de Diceto and Polydore Virgil place the Coronation of William I on Christmas day Hence it appears that they began the year on that day Walsingham and Brompton refer it to Christmas day which proves that they did not begin the year till  after  that day At the Reformation the year was appointed to begin on the th of March but others say in that being supposed by some to have  been the day when the world was created and when Christ was conceived it thus continued till when it was brought back to the st of January The Scots from time immemorial observed the th of March as the first day of the year till Nov when the st of January was ordered by proclamation to be the beginning of the year there  From these variations in the computation of time respecting the commencement of the year c we may account for the difference of dates in the several historians It has been the study therefore of the Author of this work as far as possible to reconcile them and he has happily succeeded in a thousand instances and in all he is as correct as a work of this kind which consists chiefly of figures is capable of he flatters himself therefore it will be found superior to other books of chronology where no such attention has been paid He has industriously thrown out also all unimportant matter and given the Reader only such occurrences as he must wish to be acquainted with  This work being found highly proper to be put into the hands of youth chronology being one of the chief branches of the  belles lettres  to adapt it for the purpose this edition is published wherein the author has given a more enlarged view of English history and flatters himself he has thus rendered it a complete schoolbook It is already received at Westminster Eaton Winchester Marybone c c and all other great schools as well for boys as for girls  ☞ A small edition of this work so contrived as not to exceed the size of a pocket almanack may be had of all the booksellers price s d  ADVERTISEMENT  THE events of different reigns as they arose may be found by turning to the respective kings one after another  With respect to dates no notice is taken of the Old Stile but they are regulated according to the New thus January is called January  As to ages this rule is observed if a person at his death had entered only in his th year he is recorded to have died aged  Names to which St is prefixed if not found by the first letter of the name may under the word Saint  The times in which such writers lived as were bishops if not found in alphabetical order may be seen by turning to the list of bishops  Where no distinction of country is made to the peerages that of England is implied  Where references are made to  Rem Occur  it means to those remarkable occurrences at the beginning of the Second Volume which could not be so well thrown into alphabetical order  This volume serves as a complete Index to all the Histories of England extant by referring to the years in which occurrences happened The years are generally marked in the margins of the various histories  Several historical facts will be found by referring to particular names in Vol II  The author will be very thankful for any corrections additions or improvements left with his publisher R BALDWIN  KINGS  of
