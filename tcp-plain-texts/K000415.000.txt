 AN ELEGY TO THE MEMORY OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM late EARL of BATH  LONDON Printed for W NICOLL at the PaperMill in St Paul'sChurchYard  M DCC LXV  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  THIS PIECE IS INSCRIBED TO SUCH MEMBERS of the MINORITY AS ARE ACTUATED BY A REAL SOLICITUDE FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC  BY  Their most obedient Humble Servant  The Author  ELEGY TO THE MEMORY OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM late EARL of BATH  I  SAY when the wise the dignify'd and high  Submit to fate's inexorable doom  Shall no kind anguish swell the friendly eye  Nor drop one pious off'ring on the tomb  II  Ere this some vot'ry of poetic fame  'Twas thought o BATH had kindled into fire  And wreath'd a deathless chaplet for thy name  Around the muse's consecrated lyre  III  Yet this dead silence which the muse displays  From friendship's self may possibly arise  Since all though bound to wonder and to praise  Are bound alike to pity and despise  IV  O that DEATH's dread and everlasting pause  In black oblivion might enwrap thy name  So that the loss of honour and applause  Could wash away thy baseness and thy shame  V  But truth alas will rush beyond the grave  And drag the mightiest to the face of morn  Dwell on each act that indicates the slave  And hang it up to neverending scorn  VI  'Tis then no bawd of overbearing times  Howe'er entrench'd in ermine or in pow'r  Can strain her honest dictates into crimes  Nor legal ruffian haul her to the tow'r  VII  'Tis then no dastard verdict she can hear  On some tame jury villainously stole  Nor dread a sentence fasten'd on their fear  Repugnant wholly to their sense and soul  VIII  Had the white angel of the strictly just  At one nice period PULTNEY interpos'd  And kindly snatch'd thee headlong into dust  How bright a race of glory hadst thou clos'd  IX  Then at thy mention the big drop would start  And teach each nobler sentiment to burn  All BRITAIN then had screw'd thee to her heart  And pour'd immortal sorrows on thy urn  X  The nameless magic on thy voice which hung  Had then swell'd up our most exalted rhymes  And the rich thunders of thy wondrous tongue  Roll'd on impetuous to the latest times  XI  Turn back o memory if thou canst nor gaze  Where poor ambition's paltryminded breath  Could blast the harvest of so bright a praise  And chill each rip'ning dignity to death  XII  Throw some Olympus fancy on the thought  Nor let the bursting sentiment disclose  That patriot PULTNEY ever could be bought  To screen the deadliest of his country's foes  XIII  That he the godlike guardian of the state  Who still pursu'd where'er the villain fled  Could basely stoop and snatch him from his fate  When hung with honest horrors o'er his head  XIV  And stoopfor whatPerdition catch the sound  And blast it instant with the worst despair  A word which truth in ev'ry age has found  Compos'd as much of infamy as air  XV  Search the long list of nobles on record  Since empire first or dignity began  And mark how few were honour'd with MY LORD  Who grac'd the humbler epithet of MAN  XVI  In nature's earlier and exalted state  On sure foundations all distinction stood  Whoe'er had worth of consequence was great  And he was selfennobl'd that was GOOD  XVII  No star then glitter'd on the breast of shame  No sordid knave was purpled o'er with strings  'Twas worth that mark'd a subject with a name  And not the wild capriciousness of kings  XVIII  But when some spoiler rushing into light  The bolts of pow'r tyrannically hurl'd  And claim'd from heav'n hereditary right  To scourge the groaning nations of the world  XIX  When future kings in one oppressive line  On ev'ry human institute had trod  Nay talk'd of rights prescriptively divine  To burst the dreadest mandates of their God  XX  Then the mad licence of unbounded rule  A  brand  of title to it's minions gave  Stamp'd the  disgrace  of honour on the fool  The public robber and the perjur'd slave  XXI  The blushless villain bore it from the hour  He vilely sold his country and his trust  The hackney'd strumpet had it for her dower  And reek'd a Duchess from the bed of lust  XXII  Yet for this breath of dignify'd disgrace  Did PULTNEY meanly pandar to a throne  Nay though it stunk upon a WALPOLE's race  Before it rankly fester'd on his own  XXIII  Here see ye meteors of a wondring state  Nor throw the moral sentiment aside  How low ambition can reduce the great  And how the wisest are debas'd by pride  XXIV  O did a puff of titlegiving wind  Point out to man a more exalted goal  Enlarge the smallest faculty of mind  Or raise the simplest excellence of soul  XXV  Did the loud herald's widelyswelling strain  The pompous coat or coronetted crest  Talk down the mad'ning anguish of a pain  Or hush a rising sorrow in the breast  XXVI  Could this ennobling quality of kings  Eternal rounds of happiness bestow  Pluck out from guilt it's neverdying stings  And purge the midnight murderer to snow  XXVII  Then e'en the basest possibly might rise  The boast and wonder of applauding times  And heav'n which saw the greatness of the prize  Look down perhaps in mercy on his crimes  XXVIII  But when we see in pond'ring on the great  The bloating glories of a monarch's breath  Can sooth no adverse circumstance of fate  Nor kindly steal a manacle on death  XXIX  When the long scene of tinsel has been clos'd  Which through unnumber'd ancestries has ran  And left the mightiest of the high expos'd  To all the various miseries of man  XXX  When we behold him languidly oppress'd  On death's pale couch all ghastly and declin'd  Or dragg'd before the godhead of his breast  And damn'd to all the hells within his mind  XXXI  'Tis then th'intrinsic emptiness of fame  In all it's pomp of nothingness shall rise  Teach wisdom's cheek to redden at a name  And virtue's brow to furrow and despise  XXXII  Titles what are ye on your noblest strings  Howe'er the weak or worthless may revere  Alas the proudest epithet of kings  Ne'er struck like BARNARD on a British ear  XXXIII  Where inbred honour happily is given  In vain the stream of dignity is shed  And sure 'tis treason at the bar of heaven  To pour a glory on a rascal's head  XXXIV  See low in earth where PULTNEY's title lies  That glittering gewgaw of a prince's nod  While BARNARD holds a patent from the skies  And soars a deathless nobleman with God  XXXV  Here thrones enwrap'd in silence and amaze  Shall shrink to look so wonderfully high  And fame herself be furnish'd with a gaze  To crack the straining fibres of her eye  XXXVI  Hear ye mad factions of the present race  Who wildly rage with discord's dang'rous brand  And call a shameless enmity for place  A gen'rous struggle for your native land  XXXVII  But chiefly hear ye celebrated few  Who  nobly  sicken at a country's groan  And acting  always  from the whitest view  Have fought from honest principle alone  XXXVIII  Is there who glowing with a godlike pride  For BARNARD's crown would emulously start  And spurn the farce of dignity aside  To raise an empire on a nation's heart  XXXIX  Let starey'd justice ever be his rule  Which all of  self  indignantly disowns  And scorns as much to be a party's tool  As crouch the servile sycophant of thrones  XL  'Tis not a blind ungovernable rage  At every act which ministers avow  That justly marks the saviour of an age  Or binds a laurel round the patriot brow  XLI  The keenest scourge that ever smote these climes  At some nice crisis for their welfare stood  And oft the mere necessity of times  Has scar'd the ruthless tyrant into good  XLII  Though hapless AFRIC at her fires exclaims  While midday suns their blazing circuit hold  Yet the same orb that lights her into flames  Matures the latent mineral to gold  XLIII  The parching natives of the baleful shore  At eve's glad summons dart themselves away  And grasp transported at the dazzling ore  Though ripen'd solely by the burning day  XLIV  Just so the patriot of an honest zeal  Swift as the light'ning vehemently wings  And grasps each measure for the public weal  Without once thinking from what source it springs  XLV  But why of patriots idly do I rave  My inmost soul the modern herd disdains  Where every boaster has his turn of slave  And vilely bawds to shackle us in chains  XLVI  Loud as the leaders of our patriot band  The public shout of liberty may claim  Yet base proscription blackens every hand  And stabs a kingdom to preserve the GAME  XLVII  What boots the casual vehemence of soul  That swells the freeborn whirlwind to the skies  Rings against GEN'RAL WARRANTS at the pole  And chills the stars with curses at EXCISE  XLVIII  If while the cause of liberty they plead  Our very patriots infamously fall  And stoop themselves to consecrate a deed  Which drags the widest ruin on us all  XLIX  What are the newborn suff'rings of the hour  If justice takes the balance in her hand  To what the mean barbarity of pow'r  In brutal GAMEACTS scatters round the land  L  Strip'd of his rights the farmer seeks the shade  Where silence kindly waits upon despair  And mourns his sacred liberties betray'd  That pamper'd wealth may trifle with a hare  LI  To grief and rage alternately he yields  Nor sheds one grateful smile upon the morn  A gen'ral ravage wastes his little fields  And speaks some purseproud ruffian of the horn  LII  Perhaps a bleeding monument he stands  To strike his neighb'ring villagers with awe  And smarts all scourg'd by LEGISLATIVE hands  Who greatly club to ROB him of the LAW  LIII  But at our MINORS let him not exclaim  Nor turn to heav'n his melancholy eyes  A patriot sure may murder for the GAME  Who damns a GEN'RAL WARRANT and EXCISE  LIV  Weep not ye RUSSIAN vassals at your state  Nor think your lot is singularly hard  Though mark'd through some severity of fate  A kind of packhorse to your casual lord  LV  What though beneath the everlasting breeze  With scarce a pittance of the meanest bread  Through life's long round you miserably freeze  And none e'er find a shelter but the dead  LVI  Yet fate in all it's bitterness was kind  And shew'd some marks of tenderness and care  Bestow'd a bless'd unthinkingness of mind  And gave a happy promptitude to bear  LVII  You can sit naked in the beating rain  E'en while the north wind violently roars  And seem regardless while the bellowing main  In horror dashes round your dreary shores  LVIII  You at a nod can prostitute a wife  Nor doubt the killing mandate to be just  Can calmly kneel and sacrifice a life  To lick the foot that tramples you in dust  LIX  But BRITONS form'd of very diff'rent mould  At ev'ry touch intuitively smart  And greatly just as generously bold  The smallest dagger pierces to the heart  LX  How then must BRITONS murmur at their fate  If candid sense decides upon the cause  When ev'n the mere AMUSEMENTS of the great  Can stab the VITAL ESSENCE of our LAWS  LXI  When ev'n the hand of LEGISLATIVE rule  Which once stood guardian at distress's door  Extends the pow'r of ev'ry WEALTHY fool  And nobly makes it GUILTY to be POOR  LXII  O for some curse executive as dread  Hot hissing instant from the starry throne  To strike the villain's execrable head  That first destroy'd our TITLE to our OWN  LXIII  Will no kind thunder pity the distress'd  And big with judgment mercifully roll  To crush his  more  than PROSTITUTED breast  To blast his actual SODOMY of soul  LXIV  Ye patriot names But why should I persist  'Tis vain with pride or av'rice to contend  Besides few BARNARDS beam upon the list  And all too like may PULTNEY in the end  LXV  O PULTNEY But comparison is pain  Where BARNARD's name we mention as divine  And fancy only aggravates the stain  Which BATH has thrown eternally on thine  LXVI  The praise of worlds in echo to the spheres  The patriot's brightest and his best reward  And all that once could ravish on our ears  Is now absorb'd in infamy and LORD  LXVII  Yet let us teach the ages still unborn  With some indulgence kindly to decide  And think that fate has cast thee out to scorn  To lash each swelling arrogance of pride  LXVIII  Let us suppose thee graciously design'd  To give one moral lesson to the ball  And teach the proudest of the human kind  How soon the wisest and the mightiest fall  LXIX  Then on the wing of widely spreading fame  Some tender mark of pity may be thrown  And those who blush the deepest at thy name  Turn back dismay'd and tremble for their own  FINIS
