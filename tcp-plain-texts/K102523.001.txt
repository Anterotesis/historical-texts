 A COMPENDIOUS HISTORY OF THE BRITISH CHURCHES IN ENGLAND SCOTLAND IRELAND AND AMERICA BY JOHN BROWN VOLUME I  A COMPENDIOUS HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND OF THE Protestant Churches in IRELAND

PRINTED BY JOHN BRYCE MDCCLXXXIV  PREFACE  THE remarkable usefulness of Church History hath been formerly hinted An acquaintance with that of our own and of our neighbouring churches must certainly be peculiarly necessary to instruct us concerning the  many divine favours received  and the  many sins ungratefully committed  in our land In this abridgement I have attempted to exhibit the principal substance of many large volumes In the English History my materials have been extracted from Fox Fuller Burnet Strype and sometimes from Collier but chiefly from Warner Neal Calamy Bennet and Pierce In the Scotch Knox Calderwood Bailie Brown Shields Burnet Wodrow Crookshanks De Foe Stevenson Kirkton's MSS Acts of Parliaments and Assemblies and even Spotswood and Guthrie c have been my conductors I have aimed at  impartiality  in my narrations but dare not pretend that I have every where attained this rare historical excellency That I might not be tempted to impose my own inventions instead of facts I have seldom dipt into the secret springs of men's actions or made reflections on them Freedoms of this kind too often render histories little better than well written romances  To compleat my historical plan I once intended compiling other two volumes of the  Histories of the Protestant churches  of France Switzerland Holland Germany Hungary Poland Sweden and Denmark to which that of the Waldenses herewith published was to have been the Introduction But want of access to many necessary vouchers together with the increasing infirmities of old age oblige me to drop this design May some other more adequate to the work speedily take it up It is not perhaps to the clerical honour that so many of them labour in civil histories while that of the church of Christ is so much neglected

Seceders in America P  A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE  WALDENSES  From whom all the Protestant churches originated  WHETHER the inhabitants of the north parts of Italy or Italy proper of which Milan was the capital received the gospel in the end of the first or the beginning of the second century of the Christian aera is uncertain During the first four centuries their doctrine worship discipline and government appear to have been much on the same footing with their neighbour churches into which a desire of conformity with the heathens and with the civil government had gradually introduced a number of lesser corruptions But from the writings of their bishops Ambrose of Milan  Philastrius and Gaudentius of Brescia in the th and of Ruffinus Chromatius and Niceas of Aquileia in the th and of Laurentius of Milan Ennodius of Pavia and others in the th century it appears that they still held all the fundamental doctrines of the gospel which were afterward opposed by the Papists They were so far from depending on the Roman Pontiff that in the last half of the th and first half of the th century they were in a state of formal separation from him and sometimes held him as an heretic Nor in the writings of Maurus of Ravenna Manfuetus of Milan or the Liturgy ascribed to Ambrose in the th and of Paulinus of Aquileia or of the less judicious Paulus Dioconus and his collection of the Homilies of the Fathers do we find the Popish doctrines relative to the scriptures the merit of good works mediation of saints or worship of creatures or their images or transubstantiation of the sacramental elements establishedbut the contrary Nay the council of Frankfort in A D made a noble stand in opposition to the worship of images and other increasing errors idolatries and superstitions of the Romish church  While the Christian church as Angilbertus of Milan mournfully laments retained almost no remains of holiness sincerity or purity God in the beginning of the th century raised up Claude bishop of Turin with great learning and faithfulness to defend and illustrate the truth in opposition to the prevailing errors and corruptions of the times in his  Commentaries  on the books of Moses Ruth Goipel according to Matthew and the Epistles of Paul to the Galatians and Ephesians and his letters to Theodomir and others He boldly maintained the equality of the other apostles to Peter and that men's works can in no respect merit the favour of God that no traditions ought to be admitted as grounds or parts of religion that men are saved by faith in Christ alone that all churches on earth are liable to  error that prayer for the dead is unprofitable that God alone and no creature whether original or image ought to be worshipped that the bread and wine in the Lord's supper are not turned into the real body and blood of Christ but are appointed representations of them The council of  Paris  in as well as Agobardus archbishop of Lyons justified Claude in the most of what he said especially in his opposition to the worship of images and superstition In the  tenth  century the doctrines of Claude were maintained by Ratherius of Verona not without a mixture of mistakes Perhaps they were more faithfully maintained by Gundulfus and his numerous followers in the  eleventh  century but their tenets have been miserably misrepresented by their Popish adversaries as well as themselves were cruelly persecuted  Notwithstanding all that the Popes could do by force or flattery the archbishop of Milan and the whole of his large diocese in Italy properly so called continued independent of Rome till about A D about which time Nicolas II by means of his agent Damian having got a party to submit laboured to expel all the married clergy These and others highly offended with the persecution of Berenger who maintained much the same doctrine as Claude of Turin had done separated themselves from all churchfellowship with the Roman see and its adherents Notwithstanding the persecutions and calumnies they suffered these opponents of the Romish corruptions exceedingly increased and spread themselves into almost all Italy and France Switzerland and part of Germany From their living in the  valleys  of the Alps these in Piedmont Savoy and places about were called  Vallenses  or  Waldenses  These in the south of France were called Albigenses or poor men of Lyons from their residence in or about  Albi  and  Lyons  From some of their principal preachers they were called  Berengarians Petrobrusians Henricians Arnoldists Esperonists  and  Josephists  as in England they were called  Lollards  Either from mere malice or by confounding them with some that were really such their adversaries called them  Manichees Cathari  c and charged them with the grossest errors and the most abominable practices but from the concurrent testimonies of the two Reyners that executed the office of Inquisitors against them and of Freher Baronius RalphCogshall Lienstein Thuanus ClaudeSeissel archbishop of Turin Ribera Paradin the emperor Frederic II and many other Papists it appears that their lives were remarkably pure and holy so that nothing but their opposition to the abominations of Rome could be justly charged upon them And from their antient manuscripts placed by Moreland in the library of Cambridge and others in the library of Geneva particularly from their  Noble lesson Explication of the Lord's prayer Creed and ten commandments Catechism Confession of sins spiritual Almanack  and  Sermons  and tracts concerning  Antichrist Purgatory  and  Invocation of saints  all dated about A D and from their  Confession of faith  of that date compared with those of and published for their own vindication in Italy France or Bohemiaand from the accounts of Reyner Pope Pius II ClaudeSeissel Thuanus and other Papists as well as of the Centuriators of Magdeburgh it appears that their doctrine worship discipline and government were all along very like to those of the reformed churches of Geneva France Holland Scotland  c  No doubt some of them had particular opinions but they generally maintained That the word of God is the ONLY rule and standard of religion that the decrees of councils and dictates of fathers are to be admitted only in so far as they agree with it that the reading and knowledge of the scripture are equally free to the laity and clergy that the scripture itself is to be read rather than the dictates of men that baptism and the Lord's supper are the  only sacraments of the New Testament church that the eucharist is to be received in both elements by the people as well as by the priests that the bread and wine used in it are but signs and symbols of Christ's body and blood that masses are impious to say them for the dead is downright madness that Purgatory or any other middle state of departed souls is but an invention of men that the invocation of saints is idolatrous that the church of Rome is the apocalyptical whore of Babylon that it is a true church which heareth the sincere word of Christ and useth the sacraments instituted by him be where it will that the Romish Pope hath no lawful primacy over the church or any title to both civil and ecclesiastical power that he and his bishops are the devouring plagues of the church that priest's marriage is lawful and vows of celibacy an invention of men and occasion of sodomy that monkery is but a stinking carcase of devotion and its orders so many marks of the Antichristian beast that dedications of churches commemorations of the dead priestly benedictions of bells mitres palls palms or other irrational creatures together with forced fastings superstitious festivals perpetual chanting of hymns and the like were invented by the devil that none but God can forgive sin and that auricular confession of it to the priests is unnecessary and ought not to be admitted instead of public satisfaction for scandals  While their regard to the scripture and learning it by heart and their uncommon holiness and in some things extreme strictness of practice sufficiently distinguished them from the Papalins and recommended their principles to all around them they were spread with marvellous success by  Bruis  and  Henry  through most of the south of  France  notwithstanding all that  Bernard  and others could do to oppose them About A D a rich merchant of Lyons commonly called  Peter Waldo  joined himself to them procured a translation of the Bible into  their vulgar language and having distributed his stock among the poor he in commenced a public teacher and had an amazing success in publishing the gospel of Christ Pope Lucius III by a sentence of excommunication consigned him and all his obstinate brethren to the devil and his angels and required all archbishops bishops princes nobles and others having authority to hunt them out and either force them back to the bosom of the church or else utterly destroy themunder pain of excommunication and confiscation of goods to themselves if they were not duly diligent Not very long after Ildesonsus king of Arragon and Frederic of Germany emitted edicts bearing That if any of their subjects should attend the sermons of these heretics or afford them meat drink or lodging their goods should be confiscated and themselves punished as guilty of high treason and charging these heretics to depart out of their dominions within three days after hearing of these edictsand encouraging all their subjects to plague and distress and despitefully use them if they did not  The Waldenses still increased and imperceptibly spread through the most of EuropeHungary Bulgaria Britain and had numerous congregations in Italy France Germany and Spain It is said they amounted to about eight or ten hundred thousand Finding their throne in danger of being shaken by their means the Pontiffs had recourse to new and extraordinary methods of subduing these opposers In the south of France where the earl of Tholouse and other great men protected them and where it seems the clergy had been more humane or indolent they almost filled both cities and country Pope Innocent II therefore delegated Reyner a Cistertian monk and Peter of Castlenau to root out these heretics In A D Dominic and his companions heartily joined them By declamations and sophistical arguments or by capital punishments where words were not effectual they laboured with no  small assiduity and zeal and ho inconsiderable success in their converting work Like missions and courts of inquisition were therefore established by  His Holiness  in every city of Europe the inhabitants of which were suspected of heresy At first these courts proceeded in much the same forms as ordinary courts of justice But encouraged by the inhuman edicts of  Frederic II  of  Germany  and  Lewis IX  of  France  the  Dominicans  gradually formed their inquisitorial judicatories into such engines of injustice treachery cruelty and filthiness as might have made devils to abhor them and blush The years  c c  are represented as most distinguished by their infernal work But sometimes these bloody reformers were driven out and murdered by the enraged populace  Some of the Rules formed for these Inquisitors were That they should never dispute any point of religion before the people That none who in any respect favoured any heretic should be allowed sacramental absolution That such as did not discover an heretic should be cut off from the church as a corrupt member That an heretic delivered over to the secular power should never be allowed to vindicate himself before the people That they should beware of favouring any condemned person before the people upon his retracting his heresy and promising to turn from it The Inquisitors should alway suppose the facts charged as fully evident and only examine the pannel on circumstances relating to them They ought alway to have a book open before them in which they may pretend the pannel's whole life and a great many depositions against him are recorded They ought constantly to threaten him with inevitable death and damnation if he do not ingenuously confess every thing and renounce his heresy They ought never to attempt to convince him by the scriptures lest themselves should  be confounded by his answers They ought never to answer directly to him and ought to heap a variety of questions upon him at once in order to confound him If he seem ready to protest that he never embraced the heresy he is charged with they ought to pretend that they have sufficient proofs of the contrary and that if he confess freely he may expect favour  While the courts of inquisition thus laboured to hunt out and destroy these witnesses of Christ the Popes excited the civil powers to persecute them in every placein  Terra Nova  in  Calabria  in  Provence  in  Dauphine  at  Paris  in  Bohemia  and  Austria  in  Germany  in  England  in  Flanders  and  Holland  in  Poland  in  Italy  in  Dalmatia  in  Croalia  in  Sclavonia  at  Constantinople  in  Greece  in  Livonia  in  Sarmatia  in  Bulgaria  and in  Spain  as  Perrin  hath particularly recorded But in  France Bohemia  and  Piedmont  we find them most cruelly murdered In order to extirpate them from the south of  France  where  Remund  earl of  Tholouse Remund  earl of  Foix  the viscount of  Beziers  and others protected them Pope Innocent III taking occasion from friar Peter's death in that country excommunicated  Remund  of  Tholouse  charging all archbishops and bishops to pronounce him accursed with sound of bell and extinction of candles every Sabbath and festival for murdering a good servant of God He absolved all his subjects from their oaths of allegiance to him and commanded all good catholicks to pursue his person and seize on his property He sent preachers through all Europe to promise paradise and all other privileges granted to those that went to the Holy War in the East to all such as should bear arms against the  Albigenses  for the space of forty days Some hundred thousands quickly marched to destroy them and seize on their spoil Terrified by their approaches  Remund  not only cleared himself from the murder of friar  Peter  but delivered  up all his property to the Pope and submitted to a most public whipping naked and to swear to be obedient to the Pope all his life and to make irreconcileable war against the  Albigenses  c To avoid commanding the crossed army against them he went off to Rome to reconcile himself with his Holiness  Beziers  was quickly besieged and taken and about sixty thousand of its inhabitants murdered in cold blood Nor could the supplications of the Popish clergy and people prevent their sharing in the common ruin The military pilgrims immediately laid siege to the town of Carcasson and having taken it put all the inhabitants to the sword They soon after with no inconsiderable loss took the city of Carcasson but the inhabitants had slipt off through a subterraneous vault and fled to Arragon Catalonia and Tholouse The earl of  Beziers  being perfidiously taken died in prison and his lands were given to Simon earl of Montfort who was made general of the Pope's army Assisted by the king of  Arragon  and by the  English  who hated Montfort the  Albigenses  still stood their ground notwithstanding all the perfidious stratagems of the Papists to destroy them The Pope's forces at length gave them a dreadful defeat in which and its issue they boasted that they killed about two millions of them The council of  Lateran  in A D having formed some new resolutions for the utter extirpation of the  Albigenses  another mighty army of perhaps crossed soldiers was raised under Simon of Montfort by which and the assistance of Lewis VIII and IX kings of France the Albigenses after a war of about years were almost utterly destroyed or driven from their country and the earl of Tholouse and their other helpers were reduced to the most humiliating terms Nor is it probable that less than of the Pontifical butchers perished in their murdering work  Multitudes of the  Albigenses  and their brethren having fled into Bohemia and Austria were soon afterwards  reckoned about eighty thousand in these parts It doth not appear that any general persecution was raised against them till about A D when  John Huss  and  Jerome  of  P  ue  partly enlightened by books from England  a bold and open stand against the Romish abomin  tions The Bohemian nobles loudly complaining of  he perfidious murder of these eminent ministers by the council of  Constance  and they and their people requiring the use of the cup in the Lord's supper the Pope excommunicated the whole nation and obtested the emperor kings princes  c  by the wounds of Christ and by their own salvation to take arms against and extirpate that accursed generation from the face of the earthpromising full remission of sin to every one who should kill any of them But the Lord for a time made the Bohemians under  Zisca  and  Procopius  the terror of all the armies that could be raised against them The Papists nevertheless by throwing about of them into deep mines and others of them into rivers and otherwise destroying them did them all the mischief they could and at length by craftily dividing them got multitudes of the poorer sort cut offNotwithstanding these murdersnotwithstanding imperial edicts prohibiting these  Bohemian brethren  that continued adhering to the truth to remain in  Bohemia  or Moraviaand notwithstanding manifold persecutions especially of their ministers they maintained their ground and had their Societies exceedingly well regulatedAs at the Reformation they entered into a fraternal correspondence with the Lutherans they shared with them in their afflictions The Bohemian nation having refused to assist Charles V in obliging the Germans to receive the decrees of the council of Trent Ferdinand his brother imprisoned fined scourged banished or murdered their principal men and confiscated their estates and disarmed and disenfranchised the city of  Prague  the capital of their country He by an edict  banished all the  brethren  and ordered their churches to be shut up This did but stir them up to resolve to be still more faithful for God and part of them to retire to Poland In Ferdinand by another edict banished about two hundred of their ministers that were married or had received their ordination in Germany  Thereafter till A D the Bohemians enjoyed not a little peace and liberty under their Popish sovereigns But Ferdinand having forced himself into the throne contrary to the fundamental constitutions of their kingdom resolved rather to render his dominions desolate than to allow an heretic to dwell in them set himself by every possible artifice as well as bloody violence to compleat the destruction of their churchin which he succeeded to his wish Contrary to his coronation oath he encouraged the Popish clergy and nobility to vex his other subjects on account of their religion Protestants were prohibited to print any thing but what was licensed by the Popish chancellor while Papists had full liberty to misrepresent reproach and abuse them The Burgrave who kept the crown and privileges of the kingdom was imprisoned because he had insisted for a free election of the king The Protestant churches began to be gradually destroyed In the states were prohibited to hold their usual meetings for consultation Their election of  Frederic  elector  Palatine  for their king did but enrage Ferdinand who was now chosen to be emperor and raising an army by a bloody war soon reduced them to their wonted or rather worse subjection By plundering noblemen's housesby extorting free quarters and money from the subjects by decoying nobles corporations ministers and others to lend their moneyby causing the cities which belonged to Protestants to maintain his standing armyby raising gold and silver to a tensold price in order to pay the Protestants and then suddenly diminishing its value as muchby ordering  creditors to lose all that they had lent during the rebellion as he called ithe first in order reduced his Protestant subjects to extreme poverty Next Commissioners of reformation were appointed in every town and  illage who laboured to disgrace the Protestant religion and extol the PopishThe most eminent men were invited to apostacy and others decoyed by their example or compelled to it An high  court of reformers  was erected from which there was no appealSuch ministers as apostatized were highly favoured and promoted while such as stedfastly adhered to their principles were barbarously abused by the soldiers or banished or murdered and their places filled with illiterate persons apostates or Jesuits Their congregations were charged to assist in persecuting them and threatened with death if they harboured or concealed them About fifty of the principal Protestant noblemen were condemned and executed and underwent their martyrdom in a most Christian manner Whatever belonged to them or other Protestants was confiscated or given to the soldiers and other Papists Ferdinand called for all the antient charters of the kingdom and destroyed themProtestant tutors for children were absolutely prohibited all Protestants were declared  outlaws  and commanded to leave the kingdom unless they resolved to become catholics within six months Protestants children were ordered to be taken from them and committed to monks or other Papists for instruction and Protestant wives were banished from their husbands Many of the antient laws securing the liberties of the subjects were repealed and the free cities were impoverished by taxes and contributions cruelly extorted and had soldiers and other mean and base men especially apostates imposed upon them for their magistrates It was enacted That none but Papists should be allowed any traffic or commerceor to learn any tradeor to make a  latter will  or to continue in hospitals and that whosoever should harbour a  Protestant preacher should suffer death with confiscation of goods Bibles and other evangelical books were sought out and destroyed Such as were weak and simple were cajoled and flattered to embrace Popery Such as attempted to leave the country were hindered Fair promises of pity or favour were perfidiously made or broken Marriage baptism and burial of Protestants were prohibited under severe penalties Such as remained in the country were either forced to conform or were barbarously murdered so that since there have scarce been any public appearances of a Protestant church in  Bohemia  But no where were the Waldenses more frequently or more cruelly persecuted or shewed more stedfastness in the faith than in their native valleys of Piedmont and places about Such multitudes of them were apprehended in the th century that the Popish archbishops of Arles and Narbonne represented to their inquisitorial persecutors That the country could not afford materials for building prisons to contain them In their enemies suddenly fell upon those of the valley of Pragela and cruelly massacred multitudes of them in the depth of winter Such as escaped the hands of these butchers generally perished by cold and hunger in the mountains No less than fifty infants were found frozen to deathsome of them in the arms of their mothers who had shared a like fete Finding that no cruelties exercised upon particular persons or places availed to their extirpation Pope  Innocent VIII  in published a most furious edict against them requiring the duke of Savoy king of France and all other princes nobles magistrates and others to take arms against them and destroy them whereever they could be found and requiring all preachers to stir up and encourage their hearers to the utmost by promises of indulgence pardon of sin and an immediate entrance to distinguished blessedness in heaven  to root them out from the face of the earth and threatening deposition to all civil and ecclesiastical rulers or officers who should not with due diligence promote this bloody workAlbert de Capitaneis his legate inforced this bull with an extensive accusation of the Waldenses and with proper directions how to extirpate them Animated by these things the princes and magistrates attacked them in every place and in every form and murdered above eight hundred thousand of theminsomuch that for a time the remains of them were scarcely visible The duke of Savoy at last fearing that his dominions would be depopulated by such a pernicious war put an end to it in them  It was not however long when Margaret de Foix cruelly persecuted part of them that inhabited the marquisate of Salluces but animated by God they drove out those that had seized their property and enjoyed it peaceably for many years Importuned by the archbishop and the Inquisitor of Turin Charles duke of Savoy in ordered part of his troops to surprize and massacre the Waldenses but finding that after they had recovered from their consternation they in their own defence killed multitudes of their murderers he was obliged to put an end to his open war and take more slow methods to destroy them who had multiplied so exceedingly of late as to be reckoned more than eight hundred thousand Encouraged by Francis I king of France and by Pope Paul III the Parliament of Turin in renewed the persecution and required the Waldenses to drive out all their  barbs  or ministers and that all the rest should under pain of death resolve within three days to go to Massand in order to promote this the most eloquent Popish preachers were sent to officiate among them but they got almost none to attend their harangues Sundry of their  barbs  were condemned and burnt By order of the French court or instigated by his own bloody disposition De Oppeda in fell  upon these about Merindol and Cabrieres and in the most cruel and barbarous manner murdered about of them and burnt boroughs and villages Philibert duke of Savoy being reestablished in his dominions by the peace of the monks excited him to raise a new persecution against the Waldenses but by means of their representation to him and to his duchess the sister of Henry of France who really befriended them a temporary stop was put to it Nevertheless it was not long when Philibert pushed and assisted by the Pope and by the kings of Spain and France sent a powerful army under the Lord of Trinity to exterminate them from the face of the earth He in and by every method cruel or perfidious did what he could to destroy them especially their ministers But the repeated rebuffs his troops met with from handfuls of these people together with the intercessions of Margaret his duchess made him grant them liberty of worshipping God in their own way by a formal treaty June th  Nevertheless within about four years after Philibert perhaps instigated by Castrocaro the bloody governor of these vallies and especially by the Pope published an edict requiring all his subjects either to give their solemn promise before a magistrate within ten days that they would go to Mass or remove out of his dominions within two months and commanding magistrates to transmit to him exact lists of all such as did not obey that he might take proper measures to punish them But the missives of the Protestant princes of Germany one of which from the Elector Palatine was exceedingly nervous and faithful together with the intercession of the duchess restrained the full execution of itthough Castrocaro exercised all the cruelty he could upon them Some of them being cruel  y prosecuted because they or their friends had assisted the French Protestants Charles IX of France wrote a letter to their duke in their favour In the end of that same  year they entered into a solemn covenant to maintain their religion and assist one another in their stedfast adherence to it which mightily encouraged themselves and not a little dispirited their enemies No sooner had the duchess died in than the bigotted Papists stirred up the duke to renew the persecution again his Waldenses but by the intercession of some great men the execution of it was in a great measure prevented His son Charles who succeeded him in had allowed them some rest had not their inveterate enemies the monks and their supporters by an infinity of villanies imposed on him and thus been permitted to exercise their cruelties Meanwhile the Waldenses in the Marquisate of Salluces which from to had fallen under the power of France were persecuted in much the same manner as their brethren under the dukes of Savoy That country returning to the duke their Popish adversaries never rested till by their perfidies and persecutions they had entirely ruined the followers of Christ in it about  Notwithstanding the Waldenses of Piedmont had in and obtained a new confirmation of their liberties every artifice was used to hasten and compleat their destruction The monks and priests loaded them with calumnies artificially dressed up to render them detestable Apostates and others were encouraged or hired to commence processes against them or to excite them to mutual law suits Their youth were tempted to lucrative marriages with Papists Such as fell under discipline were tempted to refuse submission and to commence catholics This together with the general death of their pastors by the plague in and their receiving of French ministers in their stead occasioned a relaxation of their discipline All sorts of criminals were favoured if they renounced their heresy Apostates were enriched by false contracts and such as adhered to their religion were obliged to pay taxes for them  Popish missionaries were appointed to labour among them as spies and seducers The most wicked and infamous persons were encouraged and largely bribed to bear witness against them And if any even Papists witnessed for them and against their monkish or jesuitical abusers he was in danger of being excommunicated and punished as a favourer of heresy To advise any from hearing the missionaries exposed one to death and confiscation of goods To give these missionaries full opportunity of seducing souls or prying into secrets they were appointed to collect the taxes Persons in poverty or in sickness were promised large assistance if they but engaged to go to Mass All but Papists were prohibited to have either public or private schools or to hold any kind of public office Infants were forced from their parents to be trained up by Papists A council for extirpation of heresy was formed at Turin For a trial all the Waldenses of Campillon were commanded under pain of death and confiscation of goods for ever to abandon their houses and whatever they possessed within the space of hours New forms of persecution and torture were contrived The Waldenses were continually cited to  Turin  where they were ruined by the expences of the plea or of their imprisonment While Jews heathens and Mahometans were exempted by law and no wise required to conform the Inquisition was authorized and encouraged to compel them to conform to the Romish religion or to destroy them and they were joined with  sorcerers  in the laws made against them Troops were lodged in their valleys that they might be ready in a moment to cut their throats To gratify their own resentment Popish rulers sometimes murdered priests and then laid the blame on the Waldenses  Having by these means prepared matters Charles duke of Savoy notwithstanding his solemn treaty with them in and and notwithstanding their most humble and earnest supplications to  him and his mother and their pretended attention thereto by which their deputies were detained at Turin did by the instigation of the  council for extirpating heresy  order his troops to march unexpectedly into these valleys and murder his evangelical subjects The Marquis of Piarresse and other commanders of the troops by flattery and by perfidious promises amused the poor people to prevent their standing on their own defence or escaping to the mountainsthat they might have the barbarous pleasure of cutting all their throats or dispatching them in still crueller forms So dreadful was the cruelty and carnage made upon ministers men women and children as had scarce ever been exemplified on earth Provoked herewith Jahier Gianvel and other brave Waldenses took arms and heading small handfuls of their brethren defended themselves and often defeated their enemies even when they were twentieth or sometimes an hundred times their number This together with the remonstrances of Oliver Cromwel the States of Holland and Protestant Cantons of Switzerland obliged the Duke and his council to put a stop to their infernal massacre which they laboured to excuse and colour over with the most abominable falshoods and to confirm their liberties by a new treatyCromwel not only effectually remonstrated for their relief but procured them large collections in England pounds sterling of which he deposited as a fund for the support of their ministers and schools But by Charles restoration they were robbed of this privilege  Notwithstanding the above mentioned Treaty of  Pignerol  the Envoys from  England Holland Switzerland  and  France  who had come to interceed for these persecuted people had scarcely gone home when the court of  Savoy  and their agents had renewed their persecution and continued it notwithstanding the humble remonstrances of the persecuted and the intercessory missives from the elector of  Brandenburgh  and the states of  Holland  and  Switzerland  The poor people were obliged to attend at  Turin  if they had dependent processes They were deprived of liberty to trade Their deputies who applied to their prince were remitted to the Inquisitors The territory of  St John  was deprived of all public exercise of their religionand under the most false and frivolous pretences almost every article of the late treaty was violated Their managers of the public collections sent them by their Protestant friends were falsely charged with embezzling the money Stratagems were formed for securing the ignominious death or assassination of Mr John Leger their faithful and active moderatoror superintendent of their churches The duke and his court refused to read any petition that respected their religion or trade Bagnol who had greatly recommended himself by his burnings and unheard of cruelties in the late massacre was rewarded with the government of the valleys and quickly began to imprison or assassinate their inhabitants After he had decoyed such of them as had fled to return to their houses he and the marquis of Flory fell upon them with their troops But necessity obliging the poor people to stand in their own defence they had marvellous success against their murderers though sometimes a hundred to one This as well as the intercession of the Cantons of Switzerland induced the court of Savoy to think of renewing their treaty with them But while their deputies were at  Turin  and contrary to the most solemn declarations of the court their valleys were at once suddenly invaded by  Bagnol  and  Damian  and about sixteen or eighteen thousand butchering troops but the poor people assisted by God and with the loss of no more than six drove them out with the loss of if not of the soldiers They obtained a new treaty in but which was clogged with several injurious restrictions and with the payment of about an hundred thousand pounds sterling to the duke and his partizans for pretended  damages As the fulfilment of this treaty in some measure depended on  Lewis XIV  of  France  the Cantons of  Switzerland  States of  Holland  and court of  Britain  wrote to him in favour of these poor persecuted people as well as they did and had done to the duke of  Savoy  Notwithstanding all these treaties and assurances they were still persecuted in manifold forms till at last the court of Turin encouraged by Lewis XIV's  revocation of the edict of Nantz  and instigated by the Popish clergy commenced another furious persecution of them in which intirely ruined their churches and obliged them to disperse themselves along with the French Protestants into other countries Thus the Waldenses who had under God given birth to all the Protestant churches were at last obliged to flee for refuge amongst them  Amidst these manifold persecutions it is hard to say whether the Christian patience and stedfastness of the Waldenses or the infernal perfidies and cruelties of their enemies were most amazing Multitudes of them were condemned and publicly burnt as if they had been the most infamous criminals Multitudes of them after suffering all the cruelties terrors and tortures of the Inquisition shared the same fate After manifold oppressions and impoverishing exactions multitudes were driven from their dwellings and all their neighbours being prohibited to relieve them perished by cold and hunger They were loaded with the vilest reproaches in order to make every body abhor them and their very infants were represented as absolute monsters in the form of their bodies Sometimes they were obliged to put on boots full of boiling tallow and required to walk in them They had soldiers quartered upon them who like devils raged blasphemed and tormented them every way they could devise Sometimes they were crammed into narrow rooms where they had neither room to stand sit or lie that they might be suffocated by their own breath or stench  Multitudes were thrown from the tops of rocks or into deep mines Sometimes the men were assembled and sportfully hewed in pieces by the soldiers while the women were driven into houses and barbarously burnt Multitudes were murdered in the streets and their naked carcases for several days left unburied Others were stript naked while alive and turned out amidst frost and snow Some were cast into dungeons full of snakes or like venomous tormentors Some were thrust into holes full of iron spikes in which they could neither fit nor stand upright Some were cast into prisons on the water in which they could not stretch themselves and if they turned themselves they must fall into the water Others were kept in prisons till they were suffocated perished with cold and hunger or their bodies gradually rotted alive Some had their mouths slit up to their ears Others had the flesh cut off from their faces Others were slashed in different parts of their bodies or had their members cut off one after another Others were often put to the strappado and then hewn in pieces Some had their brains dashed out against the rocks Others were nailed by the feet to trees with their heads hanging downward Others had their brains breasts or privy parts taken out▪ or cut off and broiled or roasted and eaten or otherwise shamefully or cruelly used Others had their nails torn off by pincers or had their other torments prolonged as much as possible Others were dragged furiously through streets or stony places at the tails of mules or horses Others were in the most barbarous manner hung up on tenter hooks or the like by their secret parts Others had their bodies stabbed all over with forks Some had burning matches put between their lips or fingers  c  or were roasted before or upon slow fires Such as had fled into caves were shut up smoked to death or otherwise destroyed After being brutally ravished women had stakes run up through their belly and were thus carried naked  on the soldiers shoulders or set up by way sides or had their bellies ript up or were cruelly burnt If unborn infants dropt out they were thrown into the fire given to dogs or trodden under foot Other babes were dashed against stones or precipitated from high rocks or torn asunder or cut in pieces quick by the soldiers in a way of diversion  Such were the tender mercies of the Papists towards the most harmless witnesses of Jesus Christ  A COMPENDIOUS  HISTORY  OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND  THE gospel of Christ was preached in Britain not very long after his ascension to heaven but whether by Paul Joseph of Arimathea or whom else we know not The story of Lucius the British king's request of preaching missionaries from Eleutherus bishop of Rome is not in the least probable While Diocletian the Roman emperor and his colleague furiously persecuted the Christians on the continent about A D Constantius their Cesar in Britain against his will commanded to pull down the Christian churches But as soon as he had it in his power he restrained his persecution It is said that to try his courtiers who professed themselves Christians he required them all to offer sacrifice to the heathen idols under pain of being deprived of their prefermentsand that such of them as stedfastly adhered to their religion he commended and inrolled among his particular friends  uch of them as complied with his sinful mandate he sharply rebuked as treacherous to their God and dismissed from his service as unworthy of trust In A D the bishops of York London and Britannia secunda attended the council of Arles in France  which formed several canons and transmitted them to the bishop of Rome for his consent to and observation of them Whether any British bishops attended at the council of Nice in A D I cannot determine In three British bishops along with many others at the council of Arimini in Italy were by the emperor Constantius' influence forced to sign an Arian creed Perhaps after they came home they like their Gallic brethren returned to their orthodoxy But it is manifest that not long after the British church was infected with the Arian heresy  About A D Pelagius or Morgan a famed British clergyman taught That Adam was created naturally mortal that the hurtful consequences of his first sin affected only himself that the law qualified men for heaven and was founded on promises equally good with those of the gospel that none can be the children of God unless they be free from sin that rich men cannot be qualified for the kingdom of God unless they part with all their wealth to the Lord and to the poor that man's free will attended with proper information is sufficient for every moral action without any supernatural assistance of God's grace that God's grace is given to men in proportion to their desert of itand that victory over temptation is obtained merely by the freedom of men's own will His errors being readily received and propagated by multitudes the orthodox clergy brought over Lupus and Gsrmanicus French bishops to assist them in opposing their progress and in founding seminaries of learningwhich perhaps occasioned the long continued use of the Gallican liturgy in Britain The most noted schools founded about this time were those of Dubricius and Illutus and of the monastery of Bangor  The British Christians having gradually abandoned themselves to wickedness God gave them up into the hands of their northern and savage neighbours the Scuts and Picts who terribly ravaged their country  Their Roman superiors being no longer able to assist them they called in the Saxons who ruled the north parts of Germany These barbarous heathens had no sooner repressed the Scots and Picts than they turned their arms against the Britons themselves and murdered the most of them In consequence of which they with the Christian religion were almost wholly confined to the principalities of Wales and Cornwal where St David and some other clergymen made a respectable figure  Between A D and Augustin the Romish missionary Paulin and Aidan two Scotch preachers Wilfrid bishop of York and others by their labours converted the seven kingdoms which the Saxons had erected in England to what they called the  Christian faith  Augustin's principal aim was to render them subject to the numerous ceremonies newly imposed by Pope Gregory the great The Britons and their Scottish neighbours were exceedingly averse to part with their Gallican or Grecian rites in exchange for those of Rome Dinoth and his British brethren as well as Aidan and Finan Scotch Presbyters boldly withstood the introduction of the Papal power or manner of worship into Britain Wilfrid was no less zealous for the Romish interest and laboured to have the festival of Easter observed on the day appointed at Rome it was said by Peter and Paul and to introduce the form of clergymen's shaving their heads in form of a cross After most furious contentions the Romish party assisted by Oswy Saxon king of Northumberland gained their point The same Oswy and Egbert king of Kent appointed Wighard the elected archbishop of Canterbury to repair to Rome for a pontifical consecration He dying at Rome Pope Vitalian furnished the see with the famed and truly sensible Theodore of Tarsus and sent along with him Adrian a Neapolitan monk to prevent his introduction of any of his Grecian rites Theodore having called a council of his Saxon clergy got them persuaded to unite in a  subjection to the Roman Pope and to receive a settled form of church government Assisted by the princes he drove Wilfrid of York and several other bishops from their sees because they refused to submit to his authority Wilfrid appealed to the Pontiff but the Romish decrees in his favour were disregarded in England The contest for preeminence between these two haughty diocesans continued till the end of the th century Wilfrid led the way of the afterward frequent appealing from the decisions of Canterbury to those of Rome But many of the Saxon bishops little regarded his Holiness' decisions Others reckoning Rome the fountain of their Christianity treated them with more respect  Meanwhile In a king of the West Saxons in a mixed assembly of laics and clergymen formed his Code of laws requiring That clergymen should live in a canonical manner that every child should be baptized within thirty days after its birth that none should transact worldly business on the Lord's day that the tithes appointed for the clergy should be duly paid that churches should be sanctuaries for malefactors as the  cities of refuge  had been under the Old Testament that murderers might make compensation for their crime to the friends of the persons they had murdered  After the haughty Wilfrid had for about fortysix years plagued the church with his zealous introduction of the Romish day of celebrating Easter and of their clerical tonsure of the head and with his mad promotion of monkish societies and causing of multitudes rush into them contrary to every tie or call of affection or dutyand of pilgrimages to the tombs of the apostles at Rome and had suffered not a little in the cause he died A D About the same time the English church began to be divided into parishes Many places of worship had formerly been but chapels of ease and were supplied with preachers by turns from the neighbouring monasteries in which bands of clergymen not in the best  manner lived together Many of the Scots Picts and Irish were prevailed on to receive the Romish season of  Easter  and their form of clergymen's shaving of their crowns By the labours and example of venerable Bede by the erection of schools and by the contests between Theodore and the Scots and no doubt by other causes which we know not learning prevailed more remarkably in Britain than in any other age before the Norman conquest Adhelm Ceolfred Egbert Bede Eddius Clemens and Alcuin were their most noted doctors As yet the English knew nothing of Purgatory they had little reverence for sacred reliques and opposed the worship of images The Pope began to send his legates for rectifying disorders among them and to demand  Peter Pence  for the erection and support of colleges at Rome But they did not reckon themselves his subjects nor think his palls necessary or effectual to consecrate an archbishop Their kings divided bishopricks at their pleasure without regard to his will  The Danish invasions together with the almost perpetual contentions between the Saxon kings having long rendered the state of the English church and nation exceedingly deplorable Egbert king of the West Saxons whose conquests laid the foundations of the subsequent monarchy called a council at Calcuith A D which enacted That the catholic faith and antient canons should be duly observed that all churches should be consecrated with sprinkling of holy water as a kind of baptism and with the administration of the Eucharist by the bishop of the diocese that an uniformity of principles and practice together with the impartial exercise of church government and discipline be carefully maintained that none but persons of an unblemished character nominated by the bishop of the place with the consent of the convent should be admitted as abbots or abbesses that it being uncertain from whom Scotchmen receive their orders none of them should  officiate as priests in England that all acts of preceding councils marked with the sign of the cross instead of the names of members should be carefully observed that no religious house should be alienated to common uses without extreme necessity and the consent of the conventuals and some of them in no case whatsoever that all bishops should have copies of the acts of council that neither priests nor bishops should exercise any power but in their own stations and districts that the funerals of bishops should be celebrated answerable to the prescribed form that the tenth part of their estate should after their death be given to the poor and their English slaves be set at liberty and in fine so many psalms be sung some masses said so many prayers and oblations made for the benefit of their departed souls  After the Danes had almost ruined his kingdom Alfred the grandson of Egbert obtaining the superiority forced them either to profess themselves Christians or depart the country He with great zeal promoted religion and learning He bestowed the half of his incomes upon the poor and on monasteries students at the university of Oxford which it is said he founded and indigent foreign churches By this means he recovered his subjects from their deep ignorance John Scot of Dunse was his principal teacher It is said that he himself translated the New Testament and Psalms into Saxon for the use of his subjects  In the  tenth  century the repeated ravage of the Danes again reduced England to the utmost confusion and misery Religion learning and almost every thing amiable were neglected In A D we find a synod at Graetly under king Athelstan the principal acts of which related to regular payment of tithes provisions for the poor and for parochial clergy prohibition and punishment of breaking into churches sorcery witchcraft theft robbery merchandize on Sabbath perjury manslaughtertogether  with directions for bishops to attend the courts of justice and oversee and direct their procedure and that of the subordinate clergy with respect to their religious ministrations About A D Odo archbishop of Canterbury established other ten canons asserting the sacred privileges of churches the freedom of ecclesiastical revenues from all civil taxationadmonishing the king and his nobles to shew themselves exemplary in honouring clergymen ministring justice and providing for the poordirecting bishops clergy and monks to promote religion in their respective stationsprohibiting incestuous marriages or violation of nunsexhorting Christians in general to cultivate an unity becoming such as had one Lord and held the same faith and to observe sacred festivals pay tithes and avoid superstition Dunstan having commenced primate of the English church abandoned himself to covetousness pride and sedition and was twice banished for his crimes He violently exerted himself to drive the secular canons from their monasteries and place his own monkish brethren in their room Instigated by his influence Edgar an absolute monster of lewdness rebelled against king Edwy his brother and obtained part of his kingdom and afterward fell heir to the rest He with all his might assisted Dunstan of Canterbury Oswald of Worcester and Ethelwald of Winchester in extruding the canons and in forcing the clergy to live unmarried He and Dunstan made two new systems of  Constitutions  one of sixtyfive and another of six relating to the payment of tithes the behaviour of clergymen  c  Dunstan Oswald and Adulf by their holding a plurality of sees occasioned no small contention After Dunstan had directed king Edgar and Edward his son as he pleased king Ethelred quite disregarded him as did almost all his subjects Perhaps this general contempt together with grief that almost all his schemes in favour of the monks were overturned  hastened his death and he was some time after canonized and worshipped as a saint  In the  eleventh  century Alfric archbishop of Canterbury in the  homilies  which he translated and in the letters which he wrote to his clergy plainly affirmed That the bread and wine in the Lord's supper are but  signs and seals  of his body and blood that communicating at Easter is no more profitable than at any other season and that there ought to be no  solitary  communicating of the priests He urged his clergy to live unmarried but did not pretend that marriage was unlawful nor did he persecute such as were guilty of it Elfeg his successor is chiefly famous for his heroic and Christian manner of enduring horrid abuse imprisonment and death from the Danish invaders whom he had exhorted to use the conquered English with humanityTo satisfy the justice of God for his own and his father's injustice and murder of the Saxon royal family Canute now Danish monarch of England squandered away his revenues in rebuilding and endowing monasteries To quicken the languishing zeal of his subjects he travelled in pilgrimage to Rome and it is said procured some useless bulls in their favour His so  Harold and Hardy Canute being quickly cut off the crown which they had acquired by so much fraud and murder reverted to Edward the Confessor the son of Edmond and brother to the Saxon lineal heir He advanced Robert the Norman to the fee of Canterbury By his going to Rome for his pall and by his haughty and imprudent behaviour towards the English and filling every importan  station with Normans he quickly became an objec  of general abhorrence Stigand his successor ha  no such remarkable attachment to Rome Harold the brother of the infamous Confessor having seized the throne from his nephew was soon after killed in battle and with him ended the royalty of the Sax+ons A D after it had continued about  hundred years  William duke of Normandy the conqueror took possession of the English throne and to fix his family on it he laboured to fill the principal posts of both church and state with his Norman countrymen and to introduce their language into the nation The famed Pope Gregory VII being bent to wrest all investitures in bishopricks by the collation of  Ring and Crosier  from the impure hands of magistrates he deposed one English bishop for receiving them from king William and another for his illegitimate birth but Lanfrank of Canterbury got them restored Palls from Rome now began to be thought necessary for the consecration of bishops By the most peremptory restraint of clerical marriages and laical investitures Gregory intended to render clergymen perfectly independent on civil rulers and absolute  laves of the Roman see William and Lanfrank pretended to relish his project but expressed them  elves with great caution After the Danish wars  nd Norman oppressions had long interrupted the meeting of English councils Lanfrank assembled one  t London about A D It consisted of an  rchdeacon a church officer then little known in England bishops and abbots It in part confirmed the order of Benedictine monks appoint  d the bishops seats to be fixed in the most conspicu  us place of their diocese changed some sees pro  ibited marriage to the th degree of consanguinity  ondemned simony divination and magic revived  he antient  canons  of the English church and pro  ibited clergymen to judge in causes of blood An  ther council was held the next year which prohi  ited clerical marriage established archdeacons re  ored the blessing of the marriages of the laity to  he priests and denounced punishments against all  ch as should behave rudely towards religion or  ergymen  Gregory by Hubert his legate required K Wil  am to pay up the arrears of  Peter Pence  due by his  ingdom and to take an oath of fidelity to the Roman  see William consented to the first but commanded Hubert to inform his Holiness That he held his crown of none but God and his sword and he would never render it dependent on any other Suspecting that Lanfrank had encouraged William in his disobedience Gregory cited him to Rome but being fortified by the royal prohibition he declined the journey Being threatened by Gregory's legate William commanded his subjects to acknowledge no Pope but whom he allowed and to receive no mandate from Rome without his leave Finding William no less haughty and determined than himself Gregory laboured by a mixture of flattery and threatening to render him more pliable He assembled a council a  Rome and required the Western bishops to attend it But not one from England durst go up nor did they send their excuse William having formerly reduced the lands of abbots and bishops in Normandy to much the same taxes as those of his other subjects and obliged themselves to personal services in attending his councils  c  he to the no small offence of the English clergy reduced their lands and persons to the same condition Enraged with the news of this Gregory commanded Lanfrank his minister of state to repair to Rome under pain of suspension from his office of archbishop Lanfrank sent off a justification of his conduct but was too wise to go thither himself So much did William disregard Gregory one of the most enterprising Popes that ever silled the Romish see that all his supplication and flattery could not for six years procure the release from prison of Odo bishop of Bayeaux in Normandy The ejection of the  secular canons  and  clergy  from the monasteries had formerly occasioned terrible commotions Now the exemption of monasteries from the bishops jurisdiction in which both William and Gregory had their own influence and ends occasioned no small noise Having enacted That spiritual causes should only be judged in clerical courts William  abandoned by all his principal officers that they might make their court to his sons died A D  By the interest and activity of Lanfrank William Rufus his second son succeeded him He regarded the archbishop or other clergymen no longer than he needed their assistance He seized the vacant benefices for himself and for that end kept the see of Canterbury and others several years vacant Falling dangerously sick about four years after the death of Lanfrank he professed himself a penitent promised to reform his practice and to atone for his former sins bestowed some lands upon the church He filled the see of Canterbury with the famous Anselm a Norman abbot and that of Lincoln with one Bloet his chancellor Happening to recover he heartily repented of his conduct and resolved to make the new bishops pay for their advancement Anselm had too much of the haughty dignified clergyman to comply with any thing contrary to his own inclinationHighly offended with him for refusing to assist him with money in his war with his brother and for acknowledging Urban as Pope before he had declared his mind on that point William offered to Urban to acknowledge his disputed authority providing he would send him a pall for a new archbishop of Canterbury Urban's legate having first got William to acknowledge his master's pontifical right gave the pall to Anselm who stubbornly refused to receive it from the hand of the king Not long after the Papal council of Clermont in France prohibited all laical investiture of bishops or abbots Having on several occasions insultingly desired his majesty's allowance to repair to Rome for the welfare of his soul and the good of the church Anselm contrary to his own solemn oath and to William's express prohibition set off William laid him under a sentence of banishment and seized on his revenues At Rome Anselm had his feet kissed and was revered almost on a level with Urban himself  while William was declared worthy of excommunication As Anselm had assisted in this William disregarded his missives and with reluctance received those of the Pope  William dying A D and Robert his elder brother being employed in the sacred but truly Papal and detestable war with the Mahometans in Palestine Henry the younger seized on the English throne To secure the favour of the Pope he recalled Anselm to his former station Returning more full of pride and bigotry than he had gone off he directed by the Romish council refused to pay any homage to Henry and told him that he would not stay in England if he should confer any clerical investitures as he could hold no communion with either the giver or the receivers Meanwhile Pascal the Pope taking advantage of Anselm's embroilment with Henry sent over his legate to render the Canterburian primacy more dependent on Rome Henry and his council wisely assisted Anselm in this matter and forced the legate to return before he had avowed his commission Prince Robert being on the point of invading the kingdom Henry to prevent Anselm's joining him after no small shifting promised to part with the right of investing bishops or abbots but having made peace with Robert he resolved to retain it To put Anselm who had in his councils strenuously contended for a ratification of the decrees of Gregory and Urban out of the way he sent him to Rome to beg from his Holiness that right of investitures either simply or as a particular favour but sent Warewalst elected bishop of Exeter along with him with secret instructions Pascal declared the right of investitures sacred and unalienable from the church Anselm heartily acquiesced but Warewalst boldly pled for his master and at last told his Holiness that Henry would rather part with his crown than with his right and finding Pascal no less determined in his measures he in Henry's name prohibited Anselm to return to England  Henry justified Warewalst's conduct and seized on the temporalities of Anselm's archbishoprick While the canons relative to investitures and clerical celibate which Anselm had got enacted in his synod of Westminster lay disregarded in England Warewalst persuaded Pascal to mark an indifference towards him at Rome Provoked herewith Anselm left Rome and retired to Blois in France where he told Henry's sister that he behoved to excommunicate him Henry having marched to Normandy to wrest it from Robert his elder brother patched up a peace with Anselm and the Pope compleated it by appointing That bishops and abbots upon their election should do homage to Henry that Anselm should consecrate these bishops which Henry had already invested and Henry should renounce all right to invest any more Both Henry and Anselm explained this agreement in their own favour as much as they could Anselm then applied himself to erect the new bishoprick of Ely and to persecute the married clergy whom he owned to be the best and most numerous but death cut him short Learning pride and mad zeal for clerical celibate and papal power were the distinguishing lines of his character  Henry immediately resumed his wonted powers and invested the new archbishop of Canterbury and only sent to Rome for his pall He afterward assisted him in hindering the Pope's legate to exercise his power in England To revenge this insult of his authority his Holiness supported Thurstan archbishop of York in refusing subjection to the Primate of Canterbury Observing that his subjects marked a regard for William his nephew in Normandy Henry became more tractable Pope Honorius sent John of Crema his legate who persuaded the archbishop of Canterbury to summon a council at Westminster Henry having in his perplexity surrendered his right of investitures the whole English clergy became the slaves and dependents of the Pope At the council  the legate sat on a kind of throne above the bishops and nobility He declaimed with great warmth against the abominable nature of clerical marriage or ministers intimacy with their own wives and that very night he was taken in bed with an harlot The Canterburian primate repaired to Rome and complained of the legantine mission as an encroachment upon his authority Romish flattery persuaded him to return invested with legantine power over all Britain and so laid the foundation of compleat slavery to Rome in that island To manifest his new powers he called a Synod and in his Holiness' name ratified several of the canons made by Anselm and John of Crema  As Henry had robbed his elder brother of the crown he was no sooner dead than Stephen his sister's son contrary to his thrice repeated oath of allegiance to Maud his daughter now empress of Germany seized on it To confirm himself in his usurpation he spared no promises to either clergy or laity Cringing to the Pope he admitted his legate who not only held councils in his name but caused the monks of Canterbury elect their archbishop without regarding Stephen's consentThe bishop of Winchester being made legate not only called the primate to his bar but required Stephen himself to answer for his imprisonment of some bishops and seizing on their revenuesWhile a most bloody and barbarous war between the partizans of Maud the empress and those of Stephen threw the nation into the utmost confusion Pope Innocent constituted Theobald archbishop of Canterbury and his successors  perpetual legates  of the Roman see that nothing might be transacted but under pretence of legantine power Stephen's own brother bishop of Winchester was invested with similar authority His versatile changing of parties was extremely remarkable At first he took part with Stephen his brother Next he got the Empress elected and enthroned and consigned all the friends of Stephen to the devil and his  angels And after all assisted in restoring Stephen to his throne After much contention with his fellow legate Theobald of Canterbury repaired to the Papal Synod of Rheims Stephen prohibited him to return as he had gone off without his permission To revenge this affront Theobald as well as the Pope took part with the Empress and returning to England he laid that part of it which acknowledged Stephen's authority under an  Interdict  of public worship The contending parties wearied of the war came to an accommodation but Theobald directed by his Holiness refused to crown the son of Stephen who had contrary to his oath seized on the crown  Amidst these calamities and to the infinite vexation of the bishops the monks by their charters and by exemptions purchased at Rome had gotten themselves freed from their jurisdiction and quickly after obtained mitres and other badges of episcopal dignity for their abbots They soon felt that the Pope's immediate jurisdiction was harder than that of their diocesan bishops By journies to Rome upon the election of every new abbot one of which cost about pounds sterlingand to obtain pontifical decisions of their frequent contests they were put to insupportable expences They were rendered slaves to the Pope and his legates they were exposed to the hatred of their sovereigns and involved in perpetual quarrels with the bishops and even the prosecution for justice at such a distant court was a severe punishment  Henry II the Empress' son having obtained the throne A D he applied himself to rectify the disorders of his kingdom The monks had not finished their struggle for an independence  n the bishops But Pope Adrian who was an Englishman diverted Henry from attending to it by complimenting him with the savage kingdom of Ireland providing he could conquer it The Irish primates had all been married The son had succeeded the  father for fifteen generations None of their four Metropolitans had ever purchased a pall from Rome These things made Adrian reckon them most brutish barbarians Invited to the assistance of Dermod king of Leinster who had drawn a war upon himself by his adulterous carrying off of the wife of his fellow king of Breffney Henry soon made a kind of conquest of Ireland About the same time he made Thomas Becket his chancellor on the recommendation of Theobald of Canterbury for whom Becket's address at Rome had procured the legantine power in opposition to his rival of Winchester About A D thirty persons of both sexes esteemed heretics landed in England from Germany Henry called a council at Oxford to examine their opinions It is said they were all extremely simple except Gerard their chief We know not what their real opinions were but the council delivering them up to the secular power Henry commanded them to be branded with a hot iron in their forehead and whipped out of Oxford and prohibited all his subjects to give them any meat drink or lodging Being the depth of winter they perished with hunger and cold and it is said underwent their sufferings with great patience and cheerfulness  Contrary to Theobald's advice Henry resolved to restrict the clerical power Expecting that Becket whom he had loaded with favours and who seemed to be far removed from monkish devotion would assist him in it he got him made archbishop of Canterbury after Theobald's death Becket soon after attended Pope Alexander in the council of Tours A D and secretly resigned his archbishoprick into his hands and received it back from him What remorse he pretended for receiving it by Henry's influence and the investiture from his hand I know not But it is probable that he and the Pope planned their scheme of rendering the English clergy perfectly independent on the state Not long after his return he delivered to Satan a nobleman who  had dared to oppose the entrance of one whom he had presented to the rectpry of Aynesford Henry was highly offended that one of his crown officers should have been thus excommunicated without his knowledge About twenty years before it had been decreed that such as laid violent hands on any clergyman should never be absolved by any but the Pope and in his presence The clergy were now strongly but cunningly instigated to render themselves subjects to none but the vicar of Christ To honour Anselm for his zealous invasion of the royal power Becket got him solemnly canonized for a SAINT This inflamed his clerical brethren to follow his steps in hopes of a like glorious reward  The clergy having obtained the sole jurisdiction over their own body abandoned themselves more and more to murders and other horrid enormities Of an hundred clerical murderers not so much as one was punished with degradation from his office Highly offended herewith Henry commanded That all such clergymen as should be apprehended in acts of felony murder burning of houses or the like should be carried before the civil judges▪ and punished as others but Becket withstood his orders with the utmost firmness and violence The clerical boldness in wickedness still more abounding Henry having assembled a council of his Lords spiritual and temporal at Westminster proposed to them five Constitutions extracted from the customs of Henry his grandfather  viz  That none should appeal to the Roman see without the king's consent that no bishop or archbishop should leave the kingdom without his majesty's consent that no crown officer or immediate vassal of the king should be excommunicated without his knowledge that clergymen charged with capital crimes should be judged in the king's courts that repairing of churches taking of tithes and other ecclesiastical affairs of general concern shall be judged in the civil courts These articles were heartily approved by the nobles but the bishops and  abbots obstinately refused their consent unless this all enervating clause  saving the rights of the clergy  should be added Henry threatening effectually to humble their pride all of them except  Becket  yielded and at last the Pope's legate persuaded him to feign his consent  Having got these articles unanimously established Henry called another council of his Lords spiritual and temporal at Clarendon for extracting and confirming the laws of his grandfather Sixteen articles were formed bearing That all differences relative to the right of patronage should be tried in the civil courts that no churches which are fees of the crown can be disposed of in perpetual donation without the king's consent that all clergymen charged with crimes against the laws shall appear before the Lord Chief Justice as well as before the ecclesiastical courts and none of them after conviction be protected by the church that no clergymen shall go out of the kingdom without his majesty's consent and their giving proper security of their doing nothing to the prejudice of him or his subjects that accusations of laymen in ecclesiastical courts shall be proved by reputable witnesses and whom the sheriffs shall oblige to attend if necessary that excommunicated persons shall not be obliged to continue on the spot where they lived formerly but only to abide the judgment of the church that none who immediately hold of the king or any of his barons shall be excommunicated or their estate laid under an Interdict without first acquainting him or his Chief Justice if himself be out of the kingdom that none shall appeal from the archbishop's court without his majesty's consent that bishops and abbots must perform the services annexed to their tenures when required by his justices or ministersand must be present at all trials except when sentences of blood or of losing life or limb are to be pronounced that the revenues of all vacant bishopricks abbies or  priories of a royal foundation shall be paid into the king's exchequer that the king shall have the power of conveening the electors of bishops abbots and priors and the elected must do homage to him before their consecration that he shall punish every wrong done to the superior clergy and they shall prosecute such as injure him that no goods of forfeited persons shall be protected from his seizure in churches or churchyards that all pleas of debt shall be tried in civil courts that the sons of copyholders are not to be ordained clergymen without consent of the Lord of the manor in which they were born  c  The council unanimously agreed to these constitutions But Becket refused to sign them with his episcopal seal and not long after suspended himself from the exercise of his office and imposed a penance on himself for sinfully consenting to them  Henry dealt with Alexander III who had been advanced to the Popedom by his influence to ratify the above constitutions and to constitute the archbishop of York his legate Alexander instead of this laboured to reconcile him to Becket and constituted Henry himself his legate providing he should not use his power against Becket Henry rejected the office of pontifical dignity with great indignation and resolved to humble Becket He caused him to be prosecuted for holding a royal manor for converting to his own use the revenues of the archbishoprick of York and of some other bishopricks and for embezzling pounds of the public money when he was chancellor Becket appealed  o the Pope as his sole judge and refused so much  s to converse with Henry on their points of difference Henry got him accused as a fugitive from justice and disobedient to his sovereignand afterwards of perjury and high treason No persuasions  f his fellow bishops could make Becket yield an hair  readth He insulted both them and his sovereign They pronounced him guilty of perjury in breaking  is oath of allegiance and cited him to appear before  his Holiness to answer for his conduct When the temporal Lords told him that by refusing to submit to their authority he involved himself in treason he boasted that were it not for his character he would in a duel vindicate himself against any one of them who durst charge him with a crime He fled to France where king Lewis instead of banishing him as Henry desired protected him and recommended his cause to the Roman court Henry hoped that Alexander would have gratefully befriended him and at least persuaded Becket to resign his see But neither his former favours nor his pompous embassy had any such effect on the Pope He and Becket declared ten of the constitutions of Clarendon NULL and  void  and threatened to excommunicate all such as should maintain them Becket then resigned his authority into the hands of the Pontiff But Alexander unwilling to have his faithful servant run down by the civil power and fearing that his submission might issue in the reduction of the Papal power restored him to his office and promised to assist him in it to his uttermost  The contest between Henry and Becket became more and more serious Henry published a proclamation banishing all the relations of Becket and commanding to seize all the revenues of his see for public use and prohibiting all correspondence with either him or pope Alexander and declaring it high treason to bring any bull of excommunication or any Interdict from ANY of them  c  Becket excommunicated all such as adhered to the Constitutions of Clarendon and some of Henry's more active lords or ministers were mentioned by name In a number of missives to Henry himself he mingled threatenings with argument He did all that he could to seduce clergymen and others from their allegiance But those of the province of Canterbury remained deaf to all his solicitations Suspecting that Lewis of France fomented their differences Henry levied an army to prevent an attack from France or a revolt  of his own subjects The clergy of the province of Canterbury dealt very plainly with his Holiness and represented to him the ingratitude and irregularity of his conduct Convinced by the influence of Henry's presents and by his own fears that he might join the German emperor another disobedient son Alexander appointed his legates to repair to England and there judge between him and Becket Becket raved like a madman as if Christianity would have been ruined along with his loss of his cause Nor could his friends persuade him to resign his primacy on condition of Henry's giving up the  Constitutions of Clarendon  Thus matters proceeded till about that Becket insisted for a pontifical ratification of the excommunication which he had passed against the observers of the constitutions of Clarendon and for his Holiness' allowance to consign Henry into the hands of the devil Alexander informed Henry that his allowance for his excommunication could not be long delayed unless he should repent Hitherto neither Becket nor Alexander had profited much by their quarrel The former had languished in exile and the latter had been deprived of his revenues in England But now while Lewis of France invaded Henry's dominions in Normandy Alexander manifested an uncommon regard to Becket and confirmed to him all the privileges he had formerly enjoyed To revenge this Henry entered into a league with the German emperor who hated Alexander and if the nation could have borne it he would have renounced Alexander's spiritual headship and acknowledged Pascal his rival Being informed that the English were firmly attached to his interests Alexander caused the bishop of London to admonish Henry and in his name require him to restore Becket and annul the  constitutions of Clarendon  The bishop having mildly executed his commission represented to his Holiness in Henry's name That  e inclined to continue his obedient son providing he behaved as a spiritual father and that nothing hindered  Becket's return providing he desisted from opposing the royal prerogative and laws of the land to which he had sworn subjection Reckoning this missive injurious to his character Becket consigned the writer into the hands of the devil and notified the same to his clerical brethren Finding that this contest retarded his conquest of Ireland Henry became more and more anxious to have it made up In an interview which he had with Lewis for establishing peace between them he persuaded him that it was only Becket's pride and obstinacy that prevented a reconciliation with him Both French and English nobility exclaimed against him as intolerably perverse and unfit to be protected in either kingdom Regardless of this Becket delivered up the English bishops and other clergymen to Satan in such multitudes that Henry had scarcely enow to officiate in his chapels Enraged by this Henry assured his Holiness that unless he immediately sent his legates to absolve his clergy and decide the debate between him and Becket he would secure the peace and honour of his kingdom in a manner less agreeable to his wishes Alarmed with this plain dealing Alexander immediately dispatched his legates to England with flattering letters to Henry bearing That they had full power to terminate the differences and absolve the excommunicated But he privately assured Becket that he would take care of his interests and advised him to dissemble for a little time He gave the legates secret instructions to give no decision without first acquainting the archbishop of Sens in France who was a trusty friend of Becket The legates therefore cavilled at every thing which Henry proposed Observing their conduct Henry threatened to do himself justice by another method The replied that they feared none of his threatenings as they belonged to a court which had been accustomed to command kings and emperors  Not long after Lewis procured another meeting between Henry and Becket in order to have them  reconciled Henry offered to Becket a full restoration of all his dignities and privileges and a thousand marks to defray the expence of his voyage Becket pretended that he had suffered marks of damage all which he must have refunded to him Finding no hope of his submission Henry sent a messenger to Pope Alexander offering him as much money as would clear his extensive debts and marks more providing that he would translate Becket to some other see and remove him from France to Rome Alexander would do no more than send other legates to mediate a peace between them But as Becket refused to promise any obedience to the king's laws but what consisted with the privileges of the Pope and the liberty of the church this attempt also proved fruitless  Finding Henry extremely tenacious of his rights the Roman court resolved to humble him by force as they had just done Frederic the German emperor To prepare their way they every where represented him and his laws as extremely detestable and extolled Becket as an almost unparalleled saint and confessor Three legates were then appointed to excommunicate Henry and lay his kingdom under an Interdict Informed of their intentions Henry renounced the authority of both Pope and archbishop and prohibited all his English subjects to receive any of their mandates He ordained That no Peterpence should be paid without his warrant that all the clergy that were out of the kingdom should immediately return under pain of forfeiting all their revenues that none should submit to any letter of Interdict under pain of being hanged on the spot as traitors to their king and country To establish his family on the throne he in a crowded assembly of his principal subjects caused Henry his eldest son to be crowned by the archbishop of York and to swear that he would inviolably observe the antient customs Becket loudly complained of injury done himpretending that the coronation indispensibly belonged  to the archbishop of Canterbury Alexander quickly consigned over the archbishop of York and all other bishops who had assisted at the coronation to the devil and his angels and threatened to do the same with Henry himself if he did not without delay make peace with Becket who at the same time notified that he would lay the kingdom under an Interdict of all public worship if he was not reconciled within fifteen days Afraid of a fate like to that of the German emperor or of trouble to his young son or perhaps of Papal damnation to his soul in the future state Henry newly recovered from a violent fever had two meetings with Becket in the presence of king Lewis in the last of which he yielded all that Becket demanded However heartily Henry had forgiven the injuries done him Becket now rendered more proud than ever prosecuted his resentments He alway went attended by an armed guard and in this manner attempted to enter the palace of the young king He prosecuted the Pope's excommunication of his fellow bishops They fled from England to Henry in Normandy and represented Becket as a public incendiary a persecutor of clergymen and a determined enemy of his king and a destroyer of all good men that came in his way Henry in his outragious passion said that it was strange that not one of his numerous dependents had courage to avenge him of a single priest who braved and sought to depose and disinherit him Four gentlemen of his houshold moved by this surious expression hasted to England and murdered Becket while he was officiating in his cathedral  The Romish court no sooner heard of it than they resolved to revenge his death in the most terrible manner The French king the bishop of Sens and others charged Henry with it and care was taken to proclaim it in the most horrid forms through all Christendom Henry was threatened with excommunication and his kingdom with an Interdict unless he should speedily give sufficient evidence of hi  repentance He dispatched his ambassadors to the several foreign courts to disown the fact and to declare his detestation of it These sent to Rome were at first rudely maltreated and had audience denied them but a present of five hundred marks sterling opened their way to his Holiness' ear Their promise that Henry would submit to the judgment of the church prevented his consignation to Satan and the interdiction of public worship in his kingdom Legates were dispatched to England to absolve him They collected all the depositions they could to prove him guilty but finding none to their purpose they allowed him at last to clear himself hy oath that he had neither commanded nor assented to the assassination They then accommodated matters with him on condition that he should never withdraw his subjection from Pope Alexander and his successors while they acknowledged him a catholic soveeign that in all ecclesiastical causes he should allow appeals to Rome that he should serve three years  n the sacred war against the Infidels in Palestine un  ess dispensed with by the Pope and should maintain two hundred men for that service that he should  ully pardon all the adherents of Becket and restore  he see of Canterbury every thing that had been taken from it during his exile and that he should  nnul all laws and customs which he had introduced to the hurt of the church to which was added this secret article That he should go barefooted to Becket's tomb and ask pardon and endure a sound whipping from all the Canterburian monks Upon  hese conditions Henry obtained pardon of a crime of which they had first caused him swear himself inno  ent when they could find no proof of it To magnify Becket they gave out that the dead body wrought more miracles than Christ and all his apo  tles had wrought for the confirmation of Christianity  tself and many thousands of mad devotees yearly  isited his tomb  The monks of Canterbury appeared to inherit his ambitious and obstinate temper They claimed the sole power of electing his successor and carried their point against both their kings Richard whom they elected was scarcely consecrated when in his council at Westminster he got eighteen  canons  enacted importing That no clergymen should marry that no sons should succeed their fathers in spiritual functions that no clergymen should frequent public houses unless when on journeys that none of them should assist in the judgment of capital crimes and that no money should be taken for the  holy chrism  or  baptism  or any other sacrament Richard's next work was a furious dispute concerning jurisdiction with Roger of York which issued in mutual blows Meanwhile the Pope's legate persuaded Henry to exempt clergymen from all civil judgment except with respect to some services and the abuse of forests In consequence of this they became the absolute slaves of the Pope and almost perpetually contested with the laity in order to inslave the whole kingdom  Alexander called a council at Rome A D and required the Western bishops to attend it Four English bishops repaired to it But Richard mindful of some offence which his Holiness had given him in taking part with his opponent prior of the monks went not They prohibited the secular powers to judge any clergyman under pain of excommunicationor to impose any tax upon them unless they generously offered their assistance and the laity were incapable to bear the necessary burdens They required all Christian princes to eztirpate hereticsto prevent their living under their jurisdictionand to confiscate their goods and render their persons slaves They decreed the same privileges as to the sacred warriors in Palestine to all such as should take arms against themThese laws were reckoned the more necessary as the Waldenses had exceedingly increased and spread themselves in several places of Eurupe  The monks of Malmsbury withdrawment of themselves from under their bishop of Salisbury and their forging of a charter for defending their disobedience drew from archbishop Richard a sensible Remonstrance to the Pope Much about the same time in a letter to one of his suffragans he laments That the English clergy had wickedly subjected themselves to the Pope instead of their lawful sovereign in consequence of which one might murder as many clergymen as he pleased and then by prostitution of an amiable wife or by a little money purchase his absolution from a priest  While Lucius the Papal successor of Alexander was busy demanding assistance from England to depress the senate and people at Rome the monks of Canterbury by king Richard's intreaties and other like methods elected Baldwin their archbishop He attempted to erect a college for the  secular canons  at his see but his Holiness instigated by the monks caused him to demolish it and hallow the ground At last the mob instigated by the monks pulled down the buildings and the archbishop with the materials laid the foundation of the palace of Lambeth which the Pope also ordered to be demolished Meanwhile great preparations were made for a mad warlike expedition to Palestine  K Richard I dying his brother John succeeded him A D Contrary to his inclination the monks of St David elected one Girald for their bishop He posted to Rome for confirmation and by his large offers thought to have been created an archbishop of Wales But king John and the archbishop defeated his project and another was made bishop Much about the same time Pope Innocent III finding the Western churches sufficiently entangled in his yoke appointed a general valuation of their revenues and the fortieth part of them to be granted for carrying on the sacred war The archbishop of York prohibited the lifting of this tax in his diocese excommunicated the officers that levied  it and laid the country under an Interdict because they would not oppose them but he was obliged to yield The monks having seized upon the rectorship of Feversham before the king's presentee had got possession of it Innocent took their part Several who had inlisted themselves for the  sacred war  drawing back Innocent appointed the bishops to excommunicate them by name every Sabbath and obliged king John notwithstanding his deep poverty to give the th part of his revenues for carrying on that mad war  Hubert the excellent archbishop of Canterbury dying the monks of that place chose Reginald their subprior to succced him He immediately posted to Rome for confirmation and notwithstanding that he had given his solemn oath to his electors that he Would not reveal his election till they should allow him he no sooner got over the channel than he every where assumed the dignity of archbishop in his way to Rome Provoked with his impiety and imprudence or fearing the king's displeasure the prevalent party of monks in the convent begged his majesty's leave to choose a new archbishop Appeased by their submission John recommended Gray bishop of Norwich to their choice and at his own expence posted off a number of the monks to obtain his confirmation at Rome while the bishops dispatched their proxies to complain that they had been deprived of their right in the election The Romish court welcomed all parties but Innocent quickly determined against the bishops and adjudged the whole right of election to the chapter of monks belonging to the see K John having taken an oath of the monks whom he had sent to Rome that they would choose none but Gray of Norwich though  himself safe to assure the Pope that he would acknowledge any whom the convent should elect Pro+mising to absolve them from their oath Innocent o+bliged the monks under pain of excommunication  to choose one Stephen Langton a native of England  but a member of the Roman court and pretending that there was no need of princes consent in his Holiness' presence he immediately consecrated him  John was altogether enraged to find one wholly attached to the French interest placed in this important station He drove out the Canterburian monks for electing their subprior without his knowledge He threatened the Pope that if he got not his will in this matter he would prohibit every future appeal from England to the Roman see Innocent boldly replied that he would but involve himself in inextricable difficulties if he dared to oppose the vicar of Christ to whom every knee must bow By his command the bishops of London and Worcester laid the English nation under an Interdict of divine worship except baptism of children taking of confessions and giving the sacrament to dying persons In consequence of this their dead were buried in ditches and highways like brutes their churches were shut up and their altars forsaken Had John turned his resentment wholly against the Roman court he might perhaps have carried his point But his seizing of bishopricks abbies and ecclesiastical revenues and requiring his subjects to renew their oath of allegiance and many of his nobles to give hostages for their fidelity gave great offence Informed of these ferments Innocent delivered him up to the devil and by flattering missives laboured to secure the favour of his offended nobles and clergy John granted the bishoprick of Lincoln to Wells his chancellor and commanded him to receive consecration not from Langton but from the bishop of Rhoan in Normandy Wells considering himself as now subject to another head repaired directly to Langton for consecration John in his rage immediately seized the temporalities of his bishoprick Nevertheless Wells' duplicitymade him suspicious of every body about him and ready to hearken to every term of accommodation He offered to admit Langton archbishop to recall the banished bishops  restore the monks of Canterbury and obey the directions of his Holiness  saving to himself and heirs the rights of the crown  Nothing less than a total surrender of himself and all his prerogatives to their mercy could content Innocent and Langton A conversation between John and Pandulf Innocent's legate in order to reconcilement proved quite unsuccessful Innocent and his party did every thing in their power to render John odious They represented him as an enemy to the rights of the church and nation Peter an hermit was employed to foretel that his royal dignity should cease before next  Ascension day  and none of his posterity ever wear the crown This exceedingly hurt him among his credulous subjects Meanwhile it was decreed at Rome that he should be deposed and another substituted in his stead Having published this sentence Innocent laboured to engage Philip of France to dethrone him promising him a throne in the heavenly paradise and the crown of England in  fee simple  to him and his heirs if he did He dispersed his missives and agents all over Europe to persuade his infatuated votaries that it would be an eminent service done to God and religion to cut off this contumacious prince and enslave the kingdom of England to the holy see and he promised full pardon of sin and all other immunities granted to the sacred warriors in Palestine to all such as should assist in this work  Philip with great zeal prepared for attacking his English neighbour and John raised an army to defend his own rights But terrified by Innocent's menacing letter and by Pandulf's exaggerated accounts of the French army John consented to deliver up his kingdom to the Pope as the only means of protecting it and to receive it back as a fief of the holy see to do homage for it to Innocent and give him his oath of subjection and resign into his hand all the patronages belonging to the crown and after all to declare solemnly That he did all  this of his own  free will  and with the advice and consent of his barons This was all performed on the Monday before  Ascension day  in the presence of multitudes Having got his ends accomplished Pandulf contrary to his promise privately slipt off leaving John in the hands of the devil and the whole nation under an Interdict King Philip was highly provoked by the Pope's mandate to stop his warlike expedition but being unwilling to draw the curse of Rome upon himself and his kingdom he submitted After receiving John's oath to govern according to law and equity Langton absolved him from the sentence of excommunication John assembled his barons to consult how the damages of the church might be repairedHighly offended with his mean submission to the Pope they resolved to take arms against him and refused to assist him in recovering that part of Normandy which Philip had seized Langton threatened to excommunicate such as would take arms before the Interdict were removed  To render his claim to the English kingdom most firm and manifest Innocent sent his legate to cause John make a second resignation in presence of his nobles and clergy and attested by the primate After the Papal charter was presented on the altar and attributed to the directive inspiration of the Holy Ghost John swore fealty and did homage to the Roman see and to Innocent and his lawful successors Upon this he received back the rights of his crown from the legate The nobles considered this second resignation of his crown as a condition of his obtaining the Pope's protection against them Langton attested the charter but protested against it and thereby drew upon himself the detestation of the Roman court Innocent and his agents now represented John as a prince of extraordinary humility and piety and the lately extolled Langton as a most wicked apostate and the other clergy who had formerly assisted the Roman usurpations but now assisted the barons in demanding a restoration of the  liberties of their kingdom as most detestable miscreants A civil war taking place John fought to retain himself and subjects slaves to the Pope The barons who had lately helped to enslave the kingdom fought for its liberties and obtained the  Magna Charta  and  Charter of forests  which still continue the foundations of English liberty John persuaded his Holiness to declare these charters  null  and void and while his barons expected nothing but peace he attacked them with an army of foreigners to many of whom he distributed the property of his native subjects They called Lewis heir to the French crown to be their sovereign Neither he nor they regarded the Pontifical thunders launched in favour of John  In Innocent and John retired to their grave and not long after Langton of Canterbury who contrary to the fears of some and the hopes of others had proved a most valiant defender of the liberties of the English church and nation The monks chose Walter one of their own number an ignorant and scandalous wretch whose father had been hanged for theft to be archbishop King Henry III and his bishops warmly opposing it Pope Gregory IX declared their election null and void and took the choice into his own hand By promising the Pope the tenth part of all the moveables in England for the support of his sacred war against the German emperor Henry got Richard chancellor of Lincoln promoted to the primacy Terrible distress and rage accompanied the levying of this  tenth part  for the Pope but fears of his Papal damnations made the people at last to comply Bishops and abbots were obliged to advance the money for their inferiors They were forced to sell or pawn the church plate or to borrow money upon it at high interest from the Italian usurers whom the Pope's Nuncio had brought along with him for that purpose  Richard dying soon after his advancement Pope Gregory intending to have all the vacant benefices of note conferred upon Italians or other foreigners opposed the monks election of Nevil bishop of Chichester fearing that like Langton he might turn out a friend to his country Enraged by this about eighty persons of high rank entered into a solemn confederacy to drive the Italian clergy out of all their preferments in England and carried their point Gregory was sufficiently provoked but Henry finding that so many great men were concerned in the affair durst punish but few of them Having got Henry made his blind dupe Gregory annulled other two elections of an archbishop and at last himself appointed Edmund treasurer of Salisbury  Contrary to the expostulations of the new archbishop Henry admitted Otho the pontifical Legate He brought with him a sett of canons to be established in a council which he called at London They imported That churches should be consecrated within two years after their erection that no abbot or rector shall pull down old churches without leave from the bishop of the diocese that no person of infamous birth or who is ignorant or scandalous be admitted to the priesthood that bishops live at their cathedrals a considerable part of the year and officiate on the  great festival  and on the  Sundays of Lent  that bishops visit their dioceses consecrate churches exercise discipline and frequently preach to the people that every one that brings a cause into a spiritual court give his oath that he doth not act from any litigious humour that every advocate at his admission give oath that he will plead according to truth and equity that all judges keep records of their procedure and give parties concerned copies on demand  c  The canon which he proposed against plurality of clerical charges was warmly opposed The principal stations of the church were quickly filled with Italians and other foreigners licentious enough in their lives but trusty slaves to  the Roman see Regardless of his subjects Henry permitted Gregory to oppress them as he pleased The English clergy and many of the people were stripped of almost all that they had for the assistance of the Pope against the emperor but the emperor's troops seized it in its passage to Rome Finding that he could do nothing effectually for the relief of his country archbishop Edmund retired into a monastery Gregory transmitted to the other bishops a list of Italians to be preferred to vacant benefices before any other should be served No matter though for want of their language they could be of no use to their flocks  Celestine IV had scarcely succeeded Gregory in when he appointed an insolent legate to strip the English clergy of the poor remains of their wealth The nobles finding Henry utterly averse to assist them resolved by themselves to restrain such exactions They commanded the wardens of the several seaports to stop every person who brought  bulls  or  mandates  from Rome A messenger was apprehended with several bulls empowering the Nuncio to raise money from the clergy The Nuncio complained to Henry but the barons boldly justified their conduct and represented to him the injustice he did to his subjects in permitting such exactions and shewed him a list of revenues enjoyed by Italian clergy in England which exceeded those of the crown The barons empowered a knight to order the Nuncio to leave the kingdom who upon his shifting told him that if he did not depart within three days he would be cut to pieces Finding that Henry could not protect him he hasted off to the no small joy of the nation  When the council of Lyons met in the English barons insisted for a redress of their grievances especially the yearly payment of a marks of tribute for the kingdoms of England and Ireland as fiefs of the Pope and of the clause  non obstante  in all his bulls After waiting for a time to no purpose  and finding that his Holiness intended only to amuse them they protested against the payment of that annual tribute and swore that they would not suffer the revenues or their church to be carried off by foreigners and then returned home  Innocent IV having obtained the Popedom pretended great favour to the English allowed their patrons to present whom they pleased and to nominate an English successor whenever any place was vacated by an Italian But he required their bishops under pain of excommunication to sign the charter by which king John had rendered the nation tributary to the Pope They meanly complied Next year the Parliament by a solemn deputation complained to his Holiness of their grievances particularly Papal exactions from clergymen and pensions from churches the robbing of patrons of their power to present proper persons to ecclesiastical charges and benefices the bestowing of benefices on Italians who understand not the English language and do not preach at their churches nor maintain any charity or hospitality there that while Italians had free and easy admission to privileges Englishmen were obliged to prosecute their rights at Rome and that the clause  non obstante  in bulls was destructive of all the laws customs and privileges of the nation Innocent being utterly averse to diminish his revenues or powers told them that he would prosecute his own measures let Henry do what he would He loaded the English clergy with new taxes and claimed right to be administrator to all bishops who died without latter wills He appointed one bishop to levy from his resident clergy  one third  and from nonresidents  one half  of their moveables under pain of excommunication or suspension After some contrary proclamations of Henry Innocent carried his point except with respect to the effects of the bishops that died intestate Provoked with these exorbitant exactions Grosthead bishop of Lincoln a man of uncommon learning and resolution set himself to oppose  both Innocent and Henry his pitiful dupe in a manner becoming his character He tore the Papal bulls which presented unqualified candidates to benefices He refused to consecrate such Italians as could not speak English He formed a list by which it appeared that Italians possessed ecclesiastical revenues in England to the value of  arks which were perhaps equal to a million sterling at present At last for refusing to consecrate an Italian boy to the first vacant benefice in his diocese and for his faithful remonstrance against the Papal wickedness he was contrary to the advice of the wiser cardinals excommunicated by the Pope He appealed to the judgment of God and continued his work in the church and died in a Christian manner bearing a solemn testimony against the Romish corruptions  Henry had scarcely forborn oppressing the clergy by exactions for a pretended expedition against the Infidels in Palestine when Pope Alexander IV about demanded another for the conquest of Sicily to prince Edmund And because they had not money bills were brought them from Italy indorsed to some merchant there and every bishop and abbot was required to sign them under pain of excommunication The Pope and king obliged them to comply the bills being a little altered After the nation had been for seven years grievously oppressed in this manner Ottobon the Pope's legate assembled a council of the English clergy at London which enacted That in case of necessity lay persons might baptize infants that no money should be taken for the administration of sacraments that no clergymen should be installed before the preceding incumbents be certainly dead that parishes should be no further divided that executors of testaments should present an inventory of their trust to their Ordinary before they begin their administration that no bishops shall sequestrate the profits of vacant livings that penance shall never be exchanged for  money that no tithes be alienated that clergymen abstain from pluralities especially such as are possessed without dispensation or institution that no benefices be held in commendam that no patrons be allowed annual sums for their grant of presentations  Edward I having ascended the throne in A D his parliament about two years after enacted a number of salutary laws for both church and state Meanwhile the general council of Lyons imposed a new tax on the whole Western church None but Peckham deacon of Lincoln opposed it Having dared to hint that the English clergy had been already so impoverished by taxations that they had scarcely whereon to live Pope Gregory X deprived him of his preferments Not long after he rejected Burnell whom the Canterburian monks had unanimously elected their archbishop and himself chose and consecrated another Peckham a learned Franciscan Peckham quickly held a council at Lambeth which confirmed the constitutions of Otho and Ottobon and further enacted That priests should carefully instruct their ignorant people that the bread in the Lord's supper was both his body and blood that unconsecrated wine merely rendered the swallowing of the bread the easier and that which was consecrated belonged only to the priests who celebrate divine service in the less important churches that baptism by lay persons is valid that the most necessary points of religion should be plainly explained to the people once every quarter of an year  As notwithstanding former prohibitions many continued devoting their estates to the church to the hurt of the nation and the impoverishment of the king's exchequerThe Parliament by the statute of  Mortmain  enacted That if any person should dispone of any heritable property to the church without the will of his immediate  superiors  of whom he held that property these or higher superiors might immediately seize on said disponed houses or lands  for themselves as their undoubted property in all time comingEdward being bent on limiting the power of the clergy he and archbishop Peckham had several warm contests The citizens and burgesses now beginning to be called as members of Parliament along with the lower clergy as a national council In this Edward demanded from the clergy an half year's revenue Finding them reluctant he charged the opposers of his motion to stand forth and take their trial as disturbers of the peace of the kingdom This obliged them to comply with his harsh demands Accounting it an unsupportable burden to attend parliaments the inferior clergy by degrees accustomed themselves to make their grants in convocations Next year Edward demanded a new supply from the clergy After procuring a bull from Pope Boniface VIII prohibiting their payment of it they pretended their terror of this bull as a reason of declining it Edward sealed up their stores and gave them till next parliament to deliberate on the affair Peckham caused publish the Pope's bull prohibiting collectors to levy it in all the cathedral churches Next year Edward called a parliament without the spiritual members which enacted That all the goods of such clergymen as refused the royal tax formerly imposed should be confiscated and themselves outlawed and prohibited judges to do them justice in any suit The clergy threatened to excommunicate all such as should seize their goods without their consent but finding that Edward would not be trifled with they after some conference yielded the point consented to pay a fine for their contumacy and to deposit a fifth part of their revenues to be employed in defence of the kingdom when needful Winchelsea archbishop of Canterbury alone remained obstinate But Edward's order to seize his whole property made him willing to part with a fourth part of it In consequence of this submission Edward and his parliament confirmed to the clergy all their wonted privileges  Not long after Boniface prohibited Edward's further attempts upon the betrayed and disjointed kingdom of Scotland But he and his barons little regarded his Holiness' mandates Boniface also presumed to put the new bishop of Worcester in possession of his temporalities as well as his spiritual jurisdiction But Edward obliged him to renounce that clause and pay a marks sterling for ever accepting it About the same time by a large present of gold plate he persuaded Pope Clement to absolve him from his coronation oath to preserve his subjects liberties secured to them by  Magna Charta  and  Charter of forests  and to give him a bull declaring all excommunication for the breaches of it null and void After humbling some of the seditious nobles he attacked the archbishop of Canterbury and by the Pope's assistance got him suspended and his see sequestered in the hands of the Nuncio Just before his death he held a parliament of laics and clergymen at Carlisle which enacted That none of the principal preferments should be granted to any foreigners that the rents of religious houses should not be given to the Pope for his college of cardinals nor should he have any title to the  first fruits  of vacant benefices that Peterpence ought never to be demanded to a triple extent that no legacies

Edward III  Mepham succeeded Reynolds in the archbishoprick of Canterbury In his provincial council he fixed the number of  holy days  and the manner of observing each He had not proceeded far in his provincial visitation when the bishop of Exeter stopt him with an armed force Edward prevented a bloody contention between them by recalling Mepham who soon after died Notwithstanding Edward's spirited remonstrances and other efforts his Holiness still supplied the ecclesiastical vacancies without regarding either king or wonted manner of election Archbishop Stratford having on account of their poverty refused Edward a clerical subsidy for carrying on his war with the French occasioned a terrible contest between him and his no less haughty sovereign who scorned to yield To prevent the Pope's filling up the vacant livings with foreigners Edward's parliament in their  statute of provisors  enacted That all such as should be convicted of bringing Papal provisions or foregrants of ecclesiastical livings into  he kingdom should ly in prison till they paid a fine  or his majesty's use and made satisfaction to the  arty injured Next year the clergy having pleased Edward with their large subsidy they had their pri  ileges further explained and confirmed against all  ncroachment of the secular courts In his next  arliament held at Westminster the famous statute  f PREMUNIRE enacted That whoever should ap  eal any cause of property to the Pope should be  utlawed from the king's protection their estates  nd moveables confiscated for his use and their per  ons imprisoned till ransomed to his content These  tatutes with that of  Mortmain  above mentioned were calculated to restrain the growing power of the Roman court but unwilling to break with his Ho  iness Edward never put them into execution  Urban V having commenced Pontiff in he  n the haughtiest manner required the English to  ay their annual tribute promised by king John Edward's parliament declared That John had no  ower to bring any such servitude upon his kingdom without their own consent and that the whole nation was determined to oppose all pretensions of  he Pope to it This spirited resolution for ever de  ivered England from this infamous tribute Complaints being presented to this parliament That clergymen had almost the whole management of the state in their hands they supplicated Edward That no clergyman should be held admittable to the offices of  chancellor privy seal treasurer baron of exchequer  and other places of the  civil list  Edward had scarce removed them from the first three o  ices when he died in and was succeeded by Richard II his grandson under whose weak government both church and state were almost ruinedIn the Parliament the statute of  premunire  was ratified and it was further enacted That whoever went beyond sea to procure himself any clerical benefice without the king's leave should be excluded from the protection of the lawes and that it should be held treasonable  to bring into the kingdom any sentence o  excommunication on account of the making of thes  statutes The bishops protested and the Pope ra+ged against these restrictions of their power Th  Nuncio was required to do nothing contrary to th  laws of the kingdom and prerogatives of the king▪ and to export no money without special warrant from him and his council  MEANWHILE the nation was not a little en+lightened with the knowledge of the truths of Christ About John Wickliff principal professor o  divinity at Oxford boldly defended the statutes o  that university against the Mendicant friars and e+ven threw out hints against their Pontifical protector▪ For this Langham archbishop of Canterbury de+prived him of his wardship and substituted a mon  in his place About the same time Langham condemned thirty opinions and king Edward commanded the heads of the university to search out an  expel all such as were tainted with them Wicklif  appealed from the archbishop's sentence to the judgment of Pope Urban but provoked with his confirmation of it he began more openly to attack the scandalous behaviour of the monks and Popesto expose the absurd superstitions which prevailed and to urge people to acquaint themselves with the word of God as the Rule of their religious conduct  and for their assistance he translated the Bible into English The clergy furiously opposed him and the monks commenced a violent prosecution of him▪ before Pope Gregory XI But the Papal schism▪ and the influence of the duke of Lancaster and other noblemen that favoured him retarded the execution of it about eight years About William Courtney archbishop of Canterbury revived the process in the councils of Lambeth and London Wickliff was accused of ten heresies and thirteen othe  errors the principal of which were That the en+charistical  bread is not by the priest's consecration of it turned into the real body of Christ that no more power was given to Peter than to the other apostles that the church of Rome is no more the head of the universal church than any other that the Pope hath no more power of jurisdiction than any other priest that if churchmen scandalously misbelieve they may be deprived of their temporalities that the gospel of Christ is a sufficient Rule of a Christian life that monastical and other additional rules add no real excellence to Christianity that clergymen ought not to have prisons for punishing men's bodies Not long after he died peaceably in his rectorship of Lutterworth without any appearance of either recanting or explaining away his tenets But about thirty years after his bones were digged up solemnly judged condemned and burnt  Notwithstanding Courtney excommunicated multitudes of Wickliff's followers who were nicknamed  Lollards  they mightily increased Taking the opportunity of Richard's absence in Ireland they attempted to have their doctrines approven by the Parliament A D They presented a spirited remonstrance in which they averred That the church of England's imitation of the Romists in the use of her temporalities had banished faith hope and charity that the English priesthood derived from Rome and pretending power over angels is not that which Christ settled on his apostles that the restraint of clergymen from marriage occasioned many scandalous immoralities that the pretended miracle of transubstantiation renders the greatest part of Christians idolaters that exorcisms or clerical benedictions of wine bread water oil wax incense stones for the altar church walls holy vestments mitres crosses  c  have more of necromancy than of religion in them that the junction of the office of  prince  and  bishop prelate  and  secular judge  in the same person is improper and hurtful that prayer for the dead is a wrong foundation of  charity and religious endowments that pilgrimages prayers and offerings to images and crosses are near of kin to idolatry that auricular confession makes priests proud admits them into the secrets of penitents and gives them opportunities for intrigues and other great offences that women's vows to live unmarried betrays them into infamous correspondences tempts them to procure abortions and murder their children unbaptized that unnecessary trades occasion pride and luxury This remonstrance so alarmed the clergy that some of the bishops posted to Ireland to bring home the king to their assistance while Arundel who had just obtained the archbishoprick assembled a council for condemning such heretical doctrines  In the barons deposed the weak and in some things tyrannical Richardand Henry IV duke of Lancaster ascended the throne as nearest heirHis parliament of revived the statutes of  provisors  and  premunire  but as he for his own security on the throne courted the favour of the clergy they continued asking and the Pope in collating of benefices The parliament also enacted That the purchasers or executors of bulls prohibiting payment of tithes or exempting from the jurisdiction of bishops should incur the penalties mentioned in the  statute of provisors  The bishops by royal warrants had formerly imprisoned multitudes of the followers of Wickliff Henry to please them and their Pope now procured a statute for  burning of heretics  in consequence of which these bishops who under Richard would not assist in condemning traitors and notorious oppressors greedily claimed the sole power of judging and committing to the flames such as they called relapsed heretics Sawtra a pious priest of London was almost immediately condemned and burnt because he  could not  believe transubstantiation  When the parliament met A D Arundel instigated by Henry assembled his clerical  council at Oxford to extirpate heresy from the university and nation They enacted That none should preach without licence from a bishop that sermons should only touch upon moral subjects and such things as had been formerly taught by the church that no books of Wickliff or his followers should be read in schools or colleges that no person without authority should translate any part of the Bible into English that no propositions or conclusions tending to the corruption of men's faith or practice should be mentioned that none should dispute concerning the worship of images holy relicks or pilgrimages or any other point fixed by the church and that the Heads of the university should once every month enquire into the principles of the students admonish them if found in an error and expel them if obstinate Nevertheless the doctrines of Wickliff still prevailedWhen Henry demanded a pecuniary aid from his parliament the Commons insisted for favour to the  Lollards  and represented That the clergy squandered away their enormous wealth in vain grandeur and unnecessary pomp that if he would take away their temporal estates the nation would be more able and ready to defend itself the poor better supplied and themselves more attentive to the duties of their station In a second remonstrance they insisted That the statute for  burning of heretics  should be either repealed or amended The clergy loudly reproached the Commons as heretics themselves and Henry haughtily rejected their requests and wished the rigour of that statute heightened Not long after he refused his assent to an act of parliament for the trial of clergymen in civil courts but cheerfully signed a warrant for the burning of one Bad by a blacksmith who could not believe transubstantiation  Wickliff's tenets still spreading were again condemned at Oxford and every one was prohibited under pain of degradation to teach them The convocation of London having urged the archbishop  to visit the university of Oxford the Heads appointed twelve of their principal doctors along with the delegates of the archbishop to examine the books of Wickliff and transmit an extract of the condemnable propositions to him and his suffragan bishops He and Henry had resolved not to leave  one Lollard  in the kingdom but death cut them both off in lamented by almost none but the abandoned clergy Just before his death Arundel had laboured to persuade young Henry V to prosecute Sir John Cobham or Oldcastle and other heretical lords Finding him averse to such cruelty Arundel and his agents pretended that Sir John had assembled of his party to massacre his whole royal family Persuaded hereof Henry assembled an army and was at midnight conducted to a place where he found about an hundred of the poor persecuted Lollards assembled for worshipping God with arms about them for their own defence from murderers Some were killed others instigated by promises and threatenings falsely confessed a plot and that Sir John was at the head of it A price being set upon his head he was soon apprehended hanged by the middle and then burnt He endured his sufferings as a couragious martyr for Christ While Arundel answered to God for his treacheries and murders Henry seemed to have been convinced that he had been imposed on and granted the Lollards an act of indemnity  After the council of Constance A D Pope Martin began to display his absolute power over the English church He often disposed of vacant bishopricks in the form of  provisions  and annulled the elections of the chapters of monks Within the province of Canterbury he in two years appointed thirteen bishops He was extremely lavish of his grants for consolidating and appropriating parish churches or of dispensations with clergymen's nonresidence or laymen's enjoyment of ecclesiastical benefices King Henry's bold remonstrance checked  his presumption a littleThe parliament enacted That none should be admitted to benefices upon Papal provisions contrary to the right of the patron and the clause  non obstante  in Papal bulls should have no effect Henry further demanded that his Holiness should dispose of no preferments in England and that himself should enjoy the Pontifical revenues of that country whenever he should be employed in defending the holy see When Martin laboured to evade these demands Henry's ambassadors protested That their master would therein use his own prerogative Martin at his own hand translated the bishop of Lincoln to the archbishoprick of York but Henry commanded the dean and chapter not to admit him and so he was forced to return to Lincoln and the Pope to acquiesce Perceiving that the French monks had marked their disaffection to him and his conquests in their country Henry turned them out of some monasteries and put Englishmen in their room  Henry VI an infant was scarce enthroned in when Chichely archbishop of Canterbury renewed the furious persecution of the Lollards Two priests were accused before the first convocation but got off with their life In the following parliament the Commons grievously complained That want of due clerical instruction tempted the subjects to Lollardism the sacraments not being duly administered many dying without the privilege of religious ceremoniesand hospitality being neglected through clergymen's nonresidence at their charges And they insisted That if any priest should absent himself from his flock six weeks in a year he should forfeit his claim to his benefice Russel a Franciscan having taught That the payment of personal tithes to the clergy was not commanded by the word of God and that they might be better laid out upon some pi  ous uses as the givers found meet was warmly persecuted for his detestable doctrine He escaped out of the kingdom but all those of his order were commanded  to preach up the contrary and the university of Oxford required all their students before receiving any degrees to swear That they would never maintain Russel's opinion or any wise assist in defending it  Archbishop Chichely having in his first convocation moved for an annulment of Papal exemptions and having advised Henry V to refuse the bishope o  Winchester for pontifical legate had rendered himself obnoxious at Rome Martin being now freed from the entanglements of his immediate predecessors charged him under pain of excommunication to labour to his uttermost to have the statutes of  provisors  and  premunire  repealed and to inform the council and parliament that every one that obeyed them lay under excommunication at Rome and to require all his clergy to teach the sameand finally to report his diligence herein attested by two credible witnesses Chichely's excuse not being sustained at Rome he was suspended from the exercise of his legantine powers He appealed to the next general council and to the tribunal of God if that should not meet Martin repeated his demands in other two missives in the last of which he put the archbishop of York first in order pretended to annul the statutes by his own power prohibited the bishops to act upon them and declared all the obeyers of them excommunicated not to be absolved by any but the Pope except at the point of death At last Chichely promised to do his utmost for the repeal of these acts Martin represented to the king and to Bedford the regent that they were obliged it conscience to repeal them and to the parliament that they could not be saved unless they voted their repeal The English rulers had learned to dissemble with his Holiness When the parliament met Chichely with great appearance of zeal insisted with the Commons for a repeal of the criminal statutes pretending to argue from scripture reason and the common consent of Christians and then with the  rest of his episcopal brethren withdrew The commons with great solemnity entered on the debate but after all refused either to repeal or amend these obnoxious acts and formed an address to his ma  esty to procure from the Pope a purgation of the archbishop who they thought had been hardly used by the Roman court The privy council would not allow the cardinal bishop of Winchester to exercise his legantine powers Nor would the duke of Gloucester who was regent allow him to officiate as prelate of the order of the garter Nor was it without manifold limitations that the council would permit him to publish the Papal croisade against the Bohemian heretics for a levy of men or to collect voluntary donations for supporting them  In the convocation of London several clergymen and others were accused of heretical hints against the worship of images and that the Pope was Antichrist and for holding some of Wickliff's opinions Such as would not recant were thrown into prisons and dungeons to teach them repentance This clerical meeting cheerfully granted a tenth part of their incomes to his majesty But neither the Pope's own demands nor all the solicitations of his Nuncio could persuade them to grant as much to him nor even a twentieth part without the king's consent Not long after the Nuncio himself was imprisoned for collecting money from the subjects contrary to law The convocation which had been originally accustomed to do nothing but give aids had perhaps in archbishop Courtney's time begun to transact ecclesiastical affairs as the bishops permitted They now appointed delegates to attend the general  Council  of Basil which met in and instructed them to insist for a check to his Holiness' dispensations with clergymen's pluralities of charges and nonresidence at them and his collation of dignities and benefices upon persons ignorant or under ageKing Henry espoused the cause of Pope Eugenius against the council of Basil and acknowledged the schismatical  conventicle of Ferrara afterward translated to Florence but the lower house of convocation refused to contribute towards the expence of sending any delegates to it When Eugenius granted the bishoprick of Ely  in cominendam  to the archbishop of Rhoan Henry at first rejected the bull and when the candidate's good services made him consent Chichely opposed his claim to the temporalitiesThe convocation enacted That none but graduates in universities should be capable of any benefice and thus empowered the seminaries of learning to prevent the admssion of ignorant wretches  After Chichely and his clergy had made several ineffectual attempts for repealing the above mentioned statutes he worn out with age that he could not perform his episcopal work begged of his Holiness to instal Stratford the bishop of Bath in his place Stratford and his clergy still insisted for a repeal of these acts which so much bridled their power Notwithstanding their master's silly complaisance Henry's ministers refused to yield Meanwhile Henry Beaufort his grand uncle cardinal bishop of Winchester died famed for nothing but sordid avarice and pride Peacock of Chichester was a kind of deist who extolled the light of nature above revelation and which was reckoned more unpardonable he espoused some of Wickliff's tenets After he had twice recanted he was deprived of his see and all students who embraced his tenets were excommunicated and expelled the university  After he had reigned thirty eight years Henry was dethroned for his weakness and Edward IV earl of March eldest branch of the line of York which had been set aside by Henry IV was made king To establish his dignity he granted the clergy every thing they asked He screened them from the statutes of  provisors  and  premunire  freed them from the jurisdictions of the civil courts and under pain of excommunication prohibited all his  judges or officers to arrest or imprison any of them He pretended to grant them these favours from a terror of the excommunication denounced by the holy canons and that he was persuaded that the miseries under which the nation had long groaned were the judgments of God for avenging the disrespect which had been shewed to his servants In Nevil archbishop of Canterbury held a council at York which appointed every priest  four times a year  to explain to his hearers the fourteen articles of faith ten commandments two gospel precepts of love to God and our neighbour  seven works of mercy  feeding the hungry giving drink to the thirsty entertaining strangers visiting the sick clothing the naked comforting prisoners and burying friendless dead  seven deadly sins  of pride envy anger hatred aversion to religion and virtue covetousness and epicurismthe  seven principal virtues  of faith hope charity prudence temperance justice and fortitude and the  seven sacraments  of baptism Lord's supper confirmation penance extreme unction marriage and ordination This was materially the same with the tenth canon of Lambeth in After Edward's dethronement restoration and death and about two or three months reign of his son Edwatd V Richard Crookback duke of Gloucester his uncle took the throne But after two years he was driven out by Henry VII duke of Richmond heir of the line of Lancaster who had married Elizabeth daughter of Edward IV and heiress of the house of York He had several contests with the ambitious clergy but his principal care was to hoard up money and so died hated or feared by all his subjects Under his reign Bourchier archbishop of Canterbury brought over the first Printing press from Harleim in Holland to Oxford in England in  Henry VIII succeeded his father in Divinity as then taught in the universities was his favourite study While many of his subjects were plotting  the destruction of his father's two most rapacious ministers Empson and Dudley he and his council were occupied in settling his marriage with Catherine aunt to Charles V emperor of Germany and king of Spain She had been married to Arthur his elder brother when he was about fifteen years of age He slept with her for a time but was said to leave her a virgin Upon his death Henry VII unwilling to lose her portion or to allow her a proper dowry on receipt of it procuring a dispensation from the Pope got her betrothed to Henry his second son in the th year of his age But perhaps repenting he made young Henry enter a solemn secret protestation against it As Catherine affirmed herself a virgin and had an agreeable and virtuous temper Henry VIII moved by some reasons of state and reckoning his conscience sufficiently protected by his Holiness' dispensation took her to his bed about two months after his father's death and they were conjunctly crowned  Henry and his courtiers having abandoned themselves to pleasure Wolsey from the rank of a chaplain pushed himself into almost the whole management of the kingdom A law had been made in the late reign That clergymen convicted should be burnt in the hand another was now made That murderers and robbers not being priests or deacons should be denied the benefit of clergy Highly offended the clergy insisted That all their orders being sacred none of them could lawfully be judged by any civil court Standish risked both his dignity and life in honestly opposing his brethren And Henry supporting the statutes Wolsey thought fit to yield But animated by his cardinal's hat and his archbishoprick of York he with great zeal promoted a clerical contribution for his Holiness to defray the expence of the Turkish war But the clergy had both wit and zeal to retain their own money Wolsey was made the Pope's  legate a latere  and appointed to visit all the monasteries in the kingdom and  empowered to visit all the monasteries in the kingdom and empowered to dispense with all ecclesiastical laws for a whole year The clergy were highly offended especially as the Pope's bulls granting him these powers had represented them as very ignorant and profligate They thought it very improper that Wolsey should pass such a censure upon when when his own vices were so remarkable But observing that their ignorance and profligacy would inevitably render them contemptible he was willing to endeavour the reformation of the inferior clergy by every tenable method except the drudgery of giving them a good example He also expected that the abominable practices found in monasteries would justify his suppression of them and converting of them into cathedrals colleges or collegiate churches But his friends advised him to suppress them by the less invidious method of Papal authority  The enormous wealth and power of the clergy had made many of them think that they might do what they pleased without reproach or controul Under pretence of a Turkish war to be carried on by all the Christian princes of Europe Pope Leo X published an Indulgence which extended to both the quick and he dead and promised forgiveness of all their sins and a complete redemption from both hell and purgatory at fixed prices for carrying on the war The subordinate disposers of these indulgences acted in the most profligate manner It is said the power of releasing souls was sometimes plaid for in taverns Zuinglius of Switzerland and Luther of Germany boldly decried this abominable merchandise Luther's books spread into England and were the more eagerly read that his doctrines appeared like to those of Wickliff The Lollards were therefore the more furiously persecuted The least word however inadvertently dropt against any ecclesiastical law was enough to found a prosecution and parents teaching their children the  Lord's prayer  and the  ten commandments  according to Wickliff's English translation  was thought a sufficient ground of  burning  them as heretics Puffed up with his own theological learning and highly offended that Luther had so freely handled T Aquinas his favourite doctor Henry published a pretended refutation of his books This procured him high flattery from Rome with a new title of  Defender of the faith  which his successors or the throne still retain But Luther in his reply treated him with very unceremonious freedom To promote the salvation of his countrymen William Tindal published an English translation of the New Testament with short notes Sir Thomas More so famed for his mildness learning and Popish piety published a virulent confutation of it The bishops poured forth their proclamations against it as a book infinitely dishonourable to God and ruinous to the souls of men and from all the pulpits in the nation charged all that had any copies of it to bring them to the  Vicar general  within thirty days under pain of excommunication and of being suspected of heresy Some were prosecuted as heretics but recantedwhile Wolsey's oppression of the nation particularly his clerical brethren with taxes diverted men's minds to other objects  AFTER Henry had lived almost twenty year  with his queen and had several children born by her her frequent miscarriages and the improbability of her having any sons provoked his dislike of her▪ Perhaps the French and Spaniards questioning the legitimacy of his daughter Mary when proposed for marriage with their princes awakened his suspicion of the unlawfulness of his own while Anne of Boleyn his queen's maid of honour had begun to captivate his capricious affections He first intimated his scruple to cardinal Wolsey and required him to declare his mind concerning his divorcing of Catherine Wolsey having had his attempt on the Popedom defeated by Charles her nephew was bent enough to do her a disservice but was wise enough to be  leave to consult the learned men of the kingdom The bishops and others being assembled advised Henry to consult all the universities in Europe and procure their determinations under their respective seals Messengers were immediately dispatched with proper instructions to consult the foreign universities In more than a year not one but that of Orleans had returned their opinionwhen Dr Cranmer then tutor to the children of a gentleman in whose house Henry happened to lodge a night suggested the propriety of obtaining and publishing the decision of the universities which if done his Holiness would scarce dare to pronounce a contrary sentence Highly pleased with the hint Henry pushed for the foreigners resolution of his two questions Whether the law of God allowed of a man's marrying his brother's wife and Whether the Pope could dispense with the laws of God All the universities except those of Rome and most of the learned in Europe Papists Lutherans and Zuinglians declared themselves in the negative of both questions With much difficulty and little unanimity the universities of Oxford and Cambridge declared the marriage unlawful Having obtained the opinions of so many learned men Henry assembled the bishops who all except Fisher of Rochester declared it unlawful and put their name and seal to their decision Warham archbishop of Canterbury put Fisher's name and seal to it but Fisher stedfastly maintained that he never empowered him to do so  Having removed Catherine from his bed Henry applied to Pope Clement VII for a divorce However willing Clement would have been that Henry had sued out his divorce in England and married another and got a legantine confirmation of his marriage he was very unwilling to displease Charles the emperor whose favour he needed against the Protestants and shifted off the affair the best way he could Campegius was at last dispatched for England with legantine powers and a bull of divorce to  be shown to Henry and Wolsey but with secret instructions to spin out the affair as long as possible The matter was begun in the legantine court by Campegius and Wolsey Catherine who had absolutely refused to retire into a monastery or to consent to her own divorce and had employed the interest of the emperor and other friends abroad to prevent it appeared once and again before the legates but appealed the cause to the Pope himself Campegius adjourned the court till the ensuing October Meanwhile the Pope called the cause before himself and cited Henry to his bar Henry commanded the earl of Wiltshire to protest against the citation as contrary to his royal prerogative and in a letter signed by cardinal Wolsey four bishops two dukes two marquisses thirteen earls two viscounts twentythree barons twenty two abbots and eleven commoners the Pope was intreated to confirm the judgment of so many learned men Henry disdained to send any to represent him as a pannel but he sent some to excuse his noncompearance and if possible to draw the cardinals to his side While Henry was fretted with delays Wolsey's enemies and even Anne of Boleyn his former friend represented him to his majesty as a treacherous conniver with Campegius and a betrayer of his master's interests They prosecuted him for accepting his legantine powers and in other different forms As Henry had given him warrants for many things charged upon him as criminal he sometimes pretended to protect him But when he thought his danger over he was arrested for high treason and poisoned himself in his way to the tower confessing That if he had served his God as faithfully as he had done his king he would not have abandoned him in his old age  In September Henry published a proclamation prohibiting all purchasing of any thing from Rome under the severest penalties and declaring his intention to annex the ecclesiastical supremacy to his crown Foreseeing that the clergy would startle  at the last he indicted them all as guilty of acknowledging and submitting to Wolsey's legantine powers and by the  statute of premunire  declared them to be out of his protection and to have forfeited all their estates and goods to his use Finding themselves at his mercy they gladly submitted to a fine of pounds sterling for his exchequer and to acknowledge him their  spiritual Head  They readily advanced the money and promised never more to meet  n convocation or to make any canons without his majesty's allowance But they thought a layman's headship over the church so absurd in itself and so inconsistent with their allegiance to the Pope that they insisted to add this clause  as far as agreeable to the laws of Christ  in their acknowledgment of it Henry for the present admitted their clause  The parliament meeting in the Commons thought it a proper season for securing themselves and their people against ecclesiastical oppressions and even the clergy finding that their prosecutions of men without any accuser causing them accuse themselves on oath or obliging them to abjure what opinions they pleased or be burnt were very disagreeableresolved to amend their customs The parliament restricted the protection of clerical criminals explained and inforced the statute of  Mortmain  which prohibited the alienation of lands to the church without consent of his majesty and other immediate superiors They prohibited the payment of  nnats and first fruits to Rome They declared that no excommunication on account of adherence to these laws should be regarded Henry at first consented to these laws only for a year But when the convocation besought him to preserve the liberties of the church he replied That no ecclesiastical constitutions should hereafter be made or executed without his consent that as some of the provincial ones already enacted were inconsistent with his prerogative he intended to have them all examined by a committee of persons half of them clergymen  and the rest members of parliament that such  were found improper might be abrogated and those that agreed with the law of God and his prerogative might be confirmed with his royal assent The clergy were obliged to submit Sir Thomas More seeing whither matters were tending resigned the Great Seal and Warham archbishop of Canterbury died  Cranmer's book against Henry's marriage with his brother's widow and his manful disputing against i  in the foreign universities procured him Henry's peculiar favour and therewith the archbishoprick o  Canterbury Apprehensive of the critical nature of the times and having his affections fixed upon a young lady he accepted the charge with the utmost reluctance At an interview Francis the French king pretending great friendship for Henry advised him neither to go himself to Rome nor send any agents to prosecute his divorce but secretly to marry Anne of Boleyn now duchess of Pembroke and he would stand by the marriage Henry did so about the th of November but it is scarcely possible that Cranmer could be present Notwithstanding the contest relative to the divorce Clemen  readily granted to Cranmer the bulls and pall for hi  archbishoprick Fearing that his oath of obedien  to the Pope might interfere with his majesty's authority or bind him up from necessary reformation▪ Cranmer took it with a protestation against tha  which he thought wrong in it Meanwhile Clemen  instigated by the emperor would neither grant Henry his divorce nor allow it to be judged in England The English convocation at Cranmer's instalment by a great majority determined as the foreign uni+versities had done but committed the question o  Catherine consummation of her marriage with Ar+thur to the canonists who determined that th  presumptions she had done it were very strong All the upper house of convocation except the bi+shop of Bath and Wells confirmed this The convocation  of York determined in the same manner Hereupon Henry avowed his marriage with Anne of Boleyn and appointed Cranmer to call a court  o judge of the nullity of his marriage with Catherine  The tidings of these transactions had provoked Clement to consign Henry into the hands of the devil had not his moderate cardinals urged him to de  ay it While Henry was on the point of a rupture with the Pope the French king persuaded him to submit his cause to him and his cardinals exclusive of the Imperialists upon the condition of obtaining  ull satisfaction Henry would not trust Clement's  romise unless he had it under his hand in writ  or would Clement trust Henry on any lower terms Belley bishop of Paris was dispatched from Rome with Clement's engagement to Henry and a day was fixed for the return of Henry's submission of his  ause Four Frenchisied cardinals were added to  verbalance the friends of the emperor Meanwhile  he emperor's agents so assiduously laboured with the Pope that he promised to revoke his engagement if Henry's return should not come on the very day appointed As perhaps through the bearer's mistake  f his way the return had not come up within that  me Clement brought the affair before his consis  ory of cardinals and notwithstanding Belley's ear  est pleadings for a delay and contrary to common  rder concluded it in their first sederunt declaring Henry's marriage with Catherine  valid  and requir  ng him to take her back to his bed under pain of  he highest ecclesiastical censure Within a day or  wo the English courier came up with Henry's sub  ission but Clement could not with honour to his  fallibility immediately revoke his decision Thus  rovidence shut up Henry to a breach with the Ro  ish court Altogether enraged with his disappoint  ent and that he had debased his supremacy in  aking his unfruitful submission Henry resolved to  ake the Romish see feel the weight of his resentment  He had already restricted the clerical prerogatives and for some years his learned subjects had been examining the foundations of the Pope's authority and all except Fisher of Rochester were persuaded that it had nothing to support it from Scripture Reason Fathers or Decrees of antient councils  When the parliament met in January a bishop preached every Lord's day at Paul's cross preparing the minds of the subjects for the intended change and teaching That the Pope had no right to authority in England The parliament confirmed their former act prohibiting the payment of Annats prohibited the presentation of candidates for bishopricks to the Pope or asking his instalment appointed bishops to be elected by the chapter of the see upon a licence from the king nominating the candidatewho after swearing faithful allegiance to his majesty should have a commission granted for his consecration and be invested with a right to the temporalities of the bishoprick They rendered the laws against heretics more agreeable to those of the kingdom They appointed that thirtytwo persons should examine all the ecclesiastical canons of England and abrogate such as they found contrary to his majesty's prerogative and the laws of the land or good of the subjectstill the finishing of which the present canons were to be held binding unless they were plainly derogatory to the royal pterogative and established laws and customs of the nation As this uncertain state of the canons left Henry full power to explain them or allow them to be executed or not these commissioners never met Elizabeth Barton the holy maid of Kent instigated by the Pope's agents pretended inspiration and to animate his subjects against Henry for opposing the Pontifical power predicted his shameful death within a month if he divorced his queen and married another She was attainted and five of her accomplices lost their lives  When the parliament received the news of Clement's decision against Henry their sovereign they especially such as favoured the Reformation resolved to tear up his authority in England by the roots They declared the whole kingdom freed from all dependence on Rome they ordered all payments to the apostolic chamber of provisions bulls and dispensations for ever to cease that all dispensations not contrary to the law of God should be hereafter granted by the two archbishops and that no licence in any matter not formerly dispensed with should be granted till it should be examined by his majesty and his council They empowered the king to visit and correct the abuses of the monasteries They suggested that the Old and New Testaments were considered as the  rule of faith  They declared Henry's marriage with Anne  valid  settled the crown on the issue of it and prohibited all under pain of misprision of treason to slander said marraige or its issue or this solemn approbation of it They took an oath of allegiance to Henry as  Head of the church  instead of the Pope and to maintain the succession of the crown to the issue of his presenc marriage and to renounce all allegiance to the Pope Not long after this oath was imposed on the clergy and many other subjects They required clergymen to preach nothing but what was agreeable to scripture and catholic tradition Sir Thomas More and bishop Fisher who had before so zealously promoted the burning of all such as could not believe transubstantiation now lost their lives because they scrupled at Henry's marriage with Anne and at the oath relative to his ecclesiastical supremacy In November this year the parliament confirmed Henry's supreme headship over the church particularly in correcting errors and heresies and to the no small grief of the clergy granted him the annats and tithes of all ecclesiastical preferments which had been formerly given to the Pope They framed an oath concerning the succession of the crown and required persons of  all ranks to take it They declared it high treason to speak against his majesty or his present queen or to call him an  heretic schismatic tyrant  or  usurper  And they made provision for the suffragan bishops  When Paul III was made Pope Henry by his minister Cassils applied to him for his reconsidering his cause Paul was exceedingly desirous of a reconciliation with England but the news of some friars and of Sir Thomas More and bishop Fisher being executed for refusing to renounce their allegiance to the Roman see made him lose all hopes of it He therefore delivered Henry into the hand of the devil and his angels absolved all his subjects from their allegiance to him commanded all ecclesiastics to leave the kingdom and all the nobles to take up arms against him prohibited all other Christians to have any dealings with the English laid the kingdom under an Interdict of divine service annulled all treaties made with Henry by foreign princes since his marriage with Anne of Boleyn and declared the issue of it spurious and incapable of succeeding to the crown  The oath approving of his majesty's marriage and the succession of the issue of it to the crown and renouncing the Papal authority had been administered by commissioners all over the nation The spread of  Tindal's New Testament  and of the  Beggar's supplication  which was chiefly directed against the lazy monks as devourers of that which belonged to the poor had contributed to the conviction of severals But the bulk of the nation still continued zealous for Popery Such as dared to oppose it were in danger of being burnt or otherwise persecuted But the queen lord Cromwel afterwards earl of Essex archbishop Cranmer Shaxton of Salisbury and Latimer of Worcester who studied to promote the reformation had influence with Henry while bishop Gardiner the duke of Norfolk and others did their utmost to oppose it None were more averse to it than the cloistered monks who openly  declared against the king's procedure begged the people to take up arms against him and laboured to embroil him with foreign princes To humble their pride Henry appointed lord Cromwel who had once been Wolsey's servant but was now made his majesty's  vicegerent in spiritual affairs  instead of the Pope's legate and others to visit their monasteries in the manner which he prescribed To prevent a  rial of their behaviour some voluntarily surrendered their monasteries into his hand Others upon examination were found guilty of the most abominable frauds Multitudes of pretended relicks were exposed and destroyed Images of pretended saints were taken down and burnt and the rich oblations made to their shrines converted to the king's use Faction and lewdness of the most unnatural kind were every where found Having considered the reports of the Commissioners for the visitation the Parliament agreed to suppress of the smaller monasteries and to give their plate and other furniture to the value of about pounds sterling and their rents amounting to pounds  per annum  to the king About ten thousand monks were turned out each of them with fortyfive shillings equal to about the value of pounds at present to carry them beyond sea or to live on till he could work and their governors had yearly pensions granted them To ease the nation these pensionaries were thrust into vacancies as fast as possible and hence most of the inferior clergy became inveterate enemies to the Reformation In and the greater monasteries were surrendered into his majesty's hand to prevent an examination of their manners The clear rents of all the suppressed hous  amounted to pounds six shillings and four pence but their true value was at least ten times more With pounds of this revenue Henry intended to erect small bishopricks but no more than those of Westminster Chester Peterborough Oxford Gloucester and Bristol were actually founded To prevent  the ecclesiastics resumption of their property mo  of the abbey lands were given to courtiers or fol  to the gentry at an easy rate In the parlia+ment complimented Henry with the chanteries co  +leges free chapels hospitals fraternities and guilds with their manors and estates together with ma+nors and parks which had belonged to the archbi+shop of York and pertaining to his Lordship o  Canterbury  Tindal's New Testament had been prohibited i  By the money with which the copies of i  were bought up for destruction he was enabled t  translate the Old and publish it along with the New corrected This corrected by Cranmer was contrary to all the solicitations of Gardner and his party published by authority But to avoid the odiou  name of Tindal who had been burnt for an hereti  in Flanders it was called Matthew's or Cranmer  Bible Meanwhile notwithstanding her piety an  virtue queen Anne by her airy and imprudent behaviour and by the accusations of her Popish enemies fell under a suspicion of infidelity about three years after her marriage Inwardly burning with lust after another Henry was highly offended with her for bearing him a  dead son  as Catherine ha  done She was quickly attainted and to please Henry condemned without any shadow of proof and beheaded May as guilty of a precontract of marriage with some other man and o  plotting Henry's death She died solemnly protesting her innocence Next day Henry married Jean Seymour the object of his outragious lust Soon after Anne's daughter Elizabeth was declared a bastard as Mary  e daughter of Catherine had been a little before Both parliament and convocation declared Anne's marriage null and void  Complaints of different doctrines delivered from pulpits being transmitted to court Henry whose spiritual headship rendered bishops and all their underlings and offices mere creatures of his crown by  circular letter to the former prohibited all preaching or about three months till proper  articles of faith  were published by his direction and authority and  gned by Cranmer and other bishops abbo    o archdeacons besides proctors In these the Old and New Testaments the Creeds attributed to  he apostlesCouncil of Nice and Athanasius were  ade the standard of faith without any regard to  he decrees of the Popes Justification through the  ighteousness of Christ alone is asserted but the re  ovation of our nature is represented as a part of it The sacraments of  confirmation marriage ordination  nd  extreme unction  are omitted Baptism is repre  ented as necessary to salvation and the washing a  ay of original sin  Transubstantiation auricular  onfession  and  penance  along with the  worship of  ints and images  are retained Prayer for the dead  commended and Purgatory left doubtful Cran  er consented in hopes of obtaining better articles  fterward But few either Papists or Protestants  ere pleased  Provoked with these articles but especially with  he suppression of the monasteries in which many  eceived alms many got places for their idle friends  nd prayers and masses were carried on night and day or their deceased relations deliverance from Purga  oryand animated by the Pope's bull above men  oned and the incendiary declamations of the monks multitudes of Papists took arms against the government In Lincolnshire a monk headed of  hem but a proclamation of pardon dispersed them The duke of Norfolk headed a more formidable par  y in the north The heads of this conspiracy a  ong which were sundry abbots and priests were  pprehended and executed These insurrections pro  ked Henry against the remaining monasteries as  urseries of rebellion He resumed which be  ad before given back to the monks The shrine  f St Becket to which the English devotees had  arked infinitely more regard than to Jesus Christ  in their annual devotions having given to it in one year about a pounds sterling when they had not given one farthing to its rival altar of Jesus Christ was demolished  Meanwhile Henry by virtue of his spiritual supremacy published certain  Injunctions  for regulating the behaviour of the clergy bearing That they should every quarter of a year preach twice against the Pope's supremacy and in defence of the king's that they should publish his late  articles of saith  and proclamation for the abolishment of some holy days in harvest that they should instruct their people to make no pilgrimages to saints or their relicks but stay at home and mind their family keep God's commandments and teach them and the Creed and Lord's prayer in English to their children that they should carefully dispense the sacraments in their parishes that they should not frequent taverns not sit long at gaming but apply themselves to the study of the scriptures and of a good life that every one who had pounds a year and did not reside at his charge should pay five pounds to the poor and every one that had a pounds should maintain a student at the university or as many students as they had hundreds a year that a th part of the livings should be applied for repairing the vicar's houses if decayed Thus Henry commanded the very things for which Wickliffites and Lutherans had been burnt  Much about the same time Cranmer Latimer and other eight bishops and some divines published the  Instruction of a Christian man  It maintains That our Saviour descended into the local hell that all articles of faith are to be interpreted according to the scriptures and the decrees of the first four general councils It maintains the doctrine of seven sacraments and of transubstantiation It restricts the clergy to two orders  bishops  and  deacons  and affirms that according to the word of God no bishop hath authority over others It restricts the invocation  of saints to a desire of their intercession with God for us It maintains That churches ought to be dedicated to none but God It allows handy labour on saints days especially during the harvest It maintains the doctrine of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ and of passive obedience to the king Not long after lord Cromwel procured Henry's allowance for all his subjects to read the Bible published by Cranmer and an order to have a copy of it set up in every church that it might be re  d between sermons or at other times by the people  Queen Jean's death in childbed of prince Edward Henry's breach with the German Protestants who refused to receive him as the Head of their league unless he abandoned transubstantiation and allowed the people the cup in the eucharist the umbrage which he conceived against Cranmer and other reforming bishops for not consenting in parliament to his appropriation of the suppressed monasteries or cheap sale of them to his favourite courtiers the hand which lord Cromwel and other reformers had in his disliked and almost immediately annulled marriage of Anne of Cleves the artifices of bishop Gardner Bonner and other Papiststogether with his own peevish humourproved a remarkable check to every attempt toward further reformation From henceforth to his death Henry prohibited all importing of foreign books or printing any part of scripture before they were examined by him and his council or the bishop of the diocese He commanded that all decriers of the old Popish ceremonies should be punished and that such as argued against  ransubstantiation should be put to death On this  oot pious Lambert whose last words were  None  ut Christ▪ none but Christ  was condemned and burnt  In the parliament made the state of religion  till worse by their act of the  Six Artieles  which esta  lished transubstantiation the withholding of the  acramental cup from the people the celibate of the  clergy vows of single life in others private mass and auricular confession and enacted That whosoever should speak preach or write against transubstantiation should be burnt as heretics and their estates be forfeited to the king and such as should dispute against the other points mentioned should suffer death as felons without the benefit of clergy that such as merely spoke or wrote against them should for the first fault forfeit all they had to the king and ly in prison during his pleasure and for the second suffer deathAll the clergy were appointed to read this act from their pulpits once every quarter of a year Cranmer opposed the making of it for three days Bishop Shaxton and Latimer were cast into prison for speaking against it Latimer continued there till Henry's death But Shaxton recanted and under Mary became a most furious persecutor Henry having granted commissions to the bishops and their commissaries to hold quarterly meetings for prosecuting of offenders against said act five hundred were immediately imprisoned But his pardoning of Cranmer and lord Cromwel discouraged the Popish zealots till they had got the latte  destroyed This parliament also enacted That proclamations of the king or under his  eal should b  held of equal authority with an act of parliament  they were consistent with the standing laws and customs of the realm and did not extend to loss of estate liberty or life They also appointed the remainin  monasteries and religious houses to be suppressed which was quickly done Thus in a few years monasteries colleges hospitals and  chantries and free chapels were empried of their inhabitants and furniture and many of them demolished Their valuable libraries were through ignorance often sold to bookbinders for a trifle  Lord Cromwel's hand in Henry's marriage wit  the immediately disliked princess of Cleves lost hi  his wonted favour The duke of Norfolk feared hi  opposing of Henry's marriage with miss Howard  queen Anne's cousin who was executed about a year after for lewdness The Papists hated him for his activity in promoting reformation He was therefore attainted of high treason in much the same manner he had done some relations of cardinal Pole sometime before As it is probable he had Henry's order for doing what was laid to his charge he was condemned without being allowed to speak in his own vindication Almost immediately after his execution two Lutheran ministers who had been condemned unheard were burnt for hints against Popery in their sermons while four Papists who had denied Henry's supremacy were hanged About this time Henry having corrected a tract called the  Erudition of a Christian man  drawn up by some divines and approved by the parliament published it as the  standard of the saith  of his subjects Its matter and plan were much like to those of the  Institutions  above mentioned An order for reading the English Bible seems to have been issued about this time  About this time bishop Bonner of London published some Injunctions for his clergy which from their nature seem to have been imposed on him by Henry probably at the request of Cranmer They required clergymen to read every day a chapter of the Bible with some gloss upon it and to study the book compiled by the bishops that no curate should be employed without being first examined by the bishop or his officers that they should instruct their people in English how to believe pray and live according to the will of God that they should endeavour to reconcile such as were at variance and be good examples of love and forgiveness to their flock that they should permit none to go to taverns or alehouses or to use unlawful games on Sabbaths or holy days in time of divine worship that they should perform the duties of their office decently and diligently use no unlawful games and never go to alehouses or taverns without urgent necessity that  no plays or interludes should be acted in their churches that in preaching they should explain the whole  gospel  and  epistle  for the day according to the opinion of some learned doctor and insist chiefly on such places as may best stir up their hearers to prayer and good works that none below a bishop should preach without a licence from his majesty or the bishop of the dioceseWhen Popery prevailed few sermons were preached but in Lent and in these scarce any care was taken to acquaint hearers with the mind of God but to extol the ceremonies of the church and stir up men to an enthusiastic devotion Cranmer did what he could to provide proper preachers and to leave the most eminent to labour in an itinerant manner But so few could be had that the most of the nation continued in gross ignorance To help the weak and restrain the wicked and erroneous from misleading the people a  Book of Homilie  on the  epistles  and  gospels  for the year containing plain paraphrases on and practical exhortations from them was published which were to be read to congregations by persons not licensed to preach Meanwhile the licensed preachers having frequent complaints brought to his majesty against them began for their own security to read their sermons and so introduced that lifeless and absurd custom now so common in the British dominions  In the parliament indirectly established the contents of the  Erudition of a Christian man  Henry was submitted to as an infallible Pope having the faith and consciences of his subjects at his disposal Even Cranmer and his reforming brethren believed the whole government of the church to depend on the magistrate's will and hence took out their commissions to hold their bishopricks only during his majesty's pleasure and to exercise authority by his direction and allowance In a faint attempt was made to reform the ecclesiastical worship Henry published an  Exhortation to prayer  and a  Litany  in which the Virgin Mary angels archangels and all  the orders of blessed saints were invoked The rest of it was much the same with that which is still used in the English church No doubt Cranmer had a hand in the composition but as his power with Henry was now much sunk it was little regarded by the subjects He also obtained some mitigation of the bloody statute of the  Six Articles  That none  hould be convicted upon it but by the oaths of twelve persons and that all information against preaching should be within forty days and the prosecution within a year Nevertheless Belenian Adams Liscals Anne Askew and others were burnt because they were not able to believe transubstantiation All the books published by Tindal Frith Joy Barnes and other Protestants were ordered to be burnt The Parliament appeared in earnest to reduce the nation to their wonted darkness of Popery They declared the catholic church judge of all controversies in religion they appointed Tindal's Bibles and all books contrary to the  Six Articles  set forth or to what may be set forth by his majesty to be destroyed they condemned all writings against transubstantiation they prohibited all annotations upon or preambles to English Bibles or New Testaments they prohibited all reading of the Bible in churches or of the English New Testament by husbandmen artificers apprentices servants women or any other of weak capacities or low stations they enacted that whoever should be convicted of preaching or maintaining any thing contrary to his majesty's  Instructions  made or to be made should for the first offence recant for the second bear a faggot and for the third be burnt Thus stood matters respecting religion when the proud peevish and corpu  ent Henry VIII died of an ulcer in his leg January A D  HIS son EDWARD an hopeful youth of  nine  years of age succeeded him His father in his last will had named sixteen persons to govern the kingdom  till he should be  eighteen  years of age to whom other twelve were added as privy counsellors The earl of Hartford uncle of Edward and afterward duke of Sommerset was chosen  Protector  King Edward himself the archbishops Cranmer and Holgate the bishops Holbeach Goodric Latimer and Ridley with secretary Paget and admiral Lisle were the most noted on the Protestant side The princess Mary the earl of Southampton and bishops Tonstal Gardner and Bonner supported the Popish Power being chiefly in the hands of the Protestants all prosecution upon the statute of the  Six Artieles  was stopt and such as had been imprisoned for religion were liberated Miles Coverdale afterward bishop of Exeter Hooper of Gloucester John Rogers and many other exiles for truth came home and served in the church Immediately after Edward's coronation Protestants began to preach against the use of images in churches and of masses for souls departed  Having begun their administration the Regents and Counsellors as in the former reign required the bishops to take out new commissions bearing their subjection to his majesty and that they held their offices and privileges only during his pleasure This▪ Cranmer and his fellow reformers hoped would bridle such as inclinced to Popery As the inferior clergy and even most of the bishops were intolerably ignorant Cranmer assisted by some others composed a  second book of Homilies  or plain discourses o  the fundamental articles of the Christian religion to be read where none was able to preach These is the number of twelve related to the use of scripture the misery of mankind by sin salvation by Christ true faith good works Christian love oaths apostacy fear of death obedience to superiors  whoredom and religious contention To procur  the consent of Gardner Cranmer shewed them first to him but he would hear of no alteration in doctrine  till Edward should be major Nevertheless the greater part of the Regents approved them  As Henry by one of his last acts of parliament had empowered his son's council to issue forth proclamations of equal authority with those of the king the Regents resolved to begin with a general visitation of the church a letter was dispatched in Edward's name to all the bishops suspending their jurisdiction during the time of visitation and prohibiting the other clergy to preach without his licence any where but in their own churches This was intended to restrain the Popish priests from spreading mischief while Protestant preachers could obtain licence to preach wherever they had opportunity In this visitation the kingdom was divided into six circuits and two gentlemen a civilian a divine and a register were appointed for each As the divines were intended for the instruction of the people as well as for examination of ecclesiastical affairs six of the most grave and popular Ridley Madew Briggs Cottisford Joseph and Farrar were appointed for this work Along with the late  Homilies  these visitors carried with them  Instructions  from Edward to be distributed among the bishops and parochial clergy many of them the same with these formerly prescribed by lord Cromwel when he visited the churches as vicar general under Henry VIII They principally required That all ecclesiastical persons should observe the laws relative to the king's prerogatives should preach once every quarter of a year against pilgrimages and prayers to images and exhort to works of faith and charity that such images as had been abused to superstition should be taken down by the clergy only that where no sermon is the Lord's prayer the creed and ten commandments be repeated from the pulpit to the people that within three months every church be provided with a Bible and within twelve with Erasmus' paraphrase upon the New Testament that none who cannot repeat the Lord's prayer the creed and the  ten commandments or who are at enmity with their neighbours be admitted to the Lord's supper that the  gospel  and  epistle  at high mass and the first and second  lesson  for every Sabbath and holy day be read in English that one chapter of the New Testament be read at  Mattins  and another of the Old at  Evensong  that clergymen often visit the sick and instruct them with passages of scripture in English that for avoiding disputes about precedence there be no more processions around churches or church yards that all shrines tables candlesticks trindills or rolls of wax pictures paintings and other monuments of idolatry or feigned miracles be removed from churches  c  that the people be instructed not to despise the ceremonies still retained but to beware of sprinkling their beds with holy water ringing o  bells or using of consecrated candles for driving away devils that patrons who dispose of livings by simoniacal pactions shall for that time forfeit their righ  of presentation to the king that the  Book of homilie  be read that dignified clergymen below bishops shall at least preach twice a year that priests shal  be reverently and charitably used for their works sake▪ These and some others respecting instruction and or+der were enjoined under pain of excommunication sequestration or deprivation as their Ordinarie should answer to the king The Injunctions for bi+shops required That they should see to their clerg  and people's exact observation of the preceding injunctions should preach four times a year withi  their own diocese unless they had a reasonable excuse that their chaplains should be able and diligen  preachers of God's word that they should ordai  none but such as would preach the doctrine set fort  in the  Homilies  Gardiner and Bonner refused t  comply with these injunctions and on that accoun  were imprisoned but soon after liberated  The parliament having met repealed all the law which made any thing treasonable but what ha  been specified in the act of the th of Edward III▪  They repealed the act of the  Six Articles  and what depended on it together with the acts that made the royal proclamations of equal authority with acts of parliament or declared any thing  felony  which was not held such before They enacted That whoever should own the Pope's supremacy or write against that of the king or should burlesque the administration of the Lord's supper now to be in both bread and wine should be punished that all private masses should be disused that all bishops shall be appointed by his majesty's letters patent and continue in office only during his pleasure that all processes in spiritual courts be carried on in his name and sealed with his seal excepting some courts belonging to the archbishop of Canterbury Contrary to the solicitations of Cranmer and his fellow bishops they bestowed on Edward all the lands of chantries which had not been granted to his father with all the oblations pertaining to them for  obits anniversaries  and  lamps  together with the guild lands enjoyed by any fraternities on like accounts They also commanded monks to remain in their places and apply themselves to handy labour but this act was soon after repealed The convocation which chiefly consisted of Papists did little more than allow the lawfulness of priests marriage and of giving the sacramental cup to the people The lower house petitioned the upper That the commission of for reforming the ecclesiastical laws might be revived that what the bishops and divines had done for correcting the offices for divine service might be laid before them and that the inferior clergy might be readmitted into the house of commons or at least no act relative to religion or the clergy be made without their consent  The Protestants abroad labouring under terrible distress several of them fled into England Of these Peter Martyr was made professor of divinity at Oxford and Bucer at Cambridge Ochinus who afterwards prepared the way for Socinianism and Fagius  had pensions granted them and were of excellent use in the universities Meanwhile the common people of England continued mad upon their old heathenish rites processions wakes carrying of candles  c  The pulpitary contentions between Popish and Protestant preachers was exceeding great All preaching without licences from his majesty or the primate was therefore prohibited till an uniformity in worship should be got established Two archbishops and sixteen or seventeen bishops and six divines were appointed to examine and reform the offices of the church They began wich the Eucharist and left it much the same as in the mass book and only added what was necessary to correspond with the communion in both kinds They left auricular confession as a matter indifferent After receiving the Lord's supper the priest was directed to turn himself to the people and read the exhortation and then require the impenitent to withdraw left the devil should enter into them with the elements After a little pause followed the confession of sins and absolution At the end of this office was hinted his majesty's intent to proceed to further reformation In correcting the other offices of worship they overlooked the word of God and composed the  evening  and  morning service  as it now stands from the Popish missals of Sarum York Hereford Bangor and Lincoln Only there was no confession or absolution From the same materials they formed the Litany as at present Only Elizabeth caused strike out the prayer for deliverance from the detestable enormities of Popery Before that time it was common for preachers after reading of their text to BID prayers directing the people for whom and what they should pray that every one might then pray silently by himself In the office of baptism the child's forehead and breast was to be marked with the sign of the cross the devil to be expelled by exorcism and the child thrice dipt in the font on its sides and breast unless it was very  weak It was then to be wrapped in white vestments and to be anointed with oil on the head with a short prayer for the descent of the Holy Ghost In confirmation the children being catechized the bishop signed them with the sign of the cross and laid his hands upon them in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost In the office for burial the soul of the deceased was recommended to the mercy of God and forgivenness of sin ready admission to heaven and a happy resurrection at the last day prayed for To the grief of Hooper Rogers and other foreign divines who reckoned them appendages of the idolatrous mass and badges of Antichrist the Romish habits of clergymen were too earnestly retained by Cranmer and Ridley for fear of too much displeasing the Papists  This  Book of common prayer  was never laid before the convocation The Popish bishops of Norwich Hereford Chichester and Westminster protested against it But the parliament in January appointed it to be used through the whole kingdom under pain of six months imprisonment and loss of a year's salary for the first faultforfeiture of all  heir preferments and a year's imprisonment for the  econdforfeiture of all their goods and imprisonment for life for the third This parliament permitted the marriage of priests and for the encou  agement of fishing prohibited eating of flesh in Lent The princess Mary absolutely refused com  iance with this new Liturgy The most of the people were highly displeased with it being excee  ingly sorry to lose their  wakes processions  many  ho  idays censing of images church ales  c Peter Martyr was molested for his theological instructions  t Oxford He offered to defend his doctrine Not long after a public disputation was held Rid  ey had another at Cambridge The Popish dispu  ants deeply entrenched themselves in the unintelligible jargon of the schoolmen while Martyr and  Ridley placed their principal dependence on the oracles of God Both parties claimed the victory  Not content with words the Popish clergy roused their votaries to arms The rebels in Devonshire amounted to strong They demanded of Edward a restoration of the  Six Articles  the performance of Mass in Latin the elevation and adoration of the sacred wafer in the Eucharist the withholding of the sacramental cup from the people the reerection of images in churches the renewal of supplications for souls in Purgatory the calling in and prohibiting of all English Bibles the rejection of the new service book and restoration of the old forms of worship The court returned them a soft answer but only the edge of the sword could bring them to reason In Norfolk the rebels headed by one Ket a tanner amounted to but the ear  of Warwick with scarce dispersed them Meanwhile Bonner of London being suspected of disloyalty was appointed to preach a sermon in which he should declare his persuasion of the king's supremacy but having hated or forgotten to do so he was deposed and imprisoned and Ridley of Westminster was also made bishop of LondonSome Anabaptists having fled hither from Germany were hunted out and prosecuted for their enthusiastical nonsense and blasphemy Joan Bocker a woman plainly delirious was burnt for some whimsical expressions concerning our Saviour's not being conceived of the substance of Mary Cranmer to his lasting reproach instigated the reluctant prince to sign the warrant for her execution George Vann▪ a poor harmless devotee of the same sect was also committed to the flames for perhaps very ignorantly affirming That only the Father is the tru  God  In A D the parliament revived Henry's ac  for appointing commissioners to reform the eccele+siastical canons and named the persons for this work They finished their work in fiftyone sections Ed+ward  dying before it received his confirmation it never had the royal sanction annexed to it but archbishop Parker published a copy of it under the title of  Reformatio legum Anglicanarum  c in which no punishment is mentioned for heretics The parliament also authorized a  Book of ordination  compiled by six bishops and six divines which is much the same with that now in use In consequence of all these reformations in worship the council ordered all clergymen to deliver up their  Massbooks  and other  Formulas  to proper persons appointed by the king  Ridley now bishop of London began to visit his diocese Besides the abovementioned Injunctions the council now appointed him and his episcopal brethren to remove all altars out of churches and provide communion tables in their steadthat so people might no more imagine the Lord's supper a sacrifice Day bishop of Chichester and Heath of Worcester insisted that Christians have an altar and refused to obey the council and on that account were deprived of their office Popular preachers were sent through the country to remove men's prejudices against the removal of the altars which had no contemptible effect As the people imagined that the priestly apparel added superior virtue and sanctity to their ministrations it would have been proper to correct their mistake Hooper who had resided at Zurich in Switzerland during the debates concerning the unlawfulness of compliance with things indifferent in themselves when abused to superstition occasioned by the emperor's  Interim form of religion  having returned home and preached with great applause was appointed bishop of Gloucester by Edward's letters patent He declined accepting it as he abhorred the swearing by saints even before the Holy Ghost in the oath or supremacy Convinced of the justness of his objection Edward struck out that phrase Hooper also looked on the use of the Popish vestments as sinful Edward and his council were inclined to dispense with the habits  but Cranmer and especially Ridley and Goodric insisted that as the things were indifferent in themselves they ought to be retained in obedience to the law Hooper consulted Peter Martyr Bucer and the Genevan and Swiss divines on this point They were all of opinion that these relicks of Popery ought to be removed from the church but thought that Hooper might comply rather than be rendered useless and breed a schism in a reforming church His case was truly pitiable His brethren would neither suffer him to live without being a bishop nor admit him in the manner his conscience approved After suffering confinement imprisonment and other hardships he at last consented to permit others to put on the vestments at his consecration and once at court Being admitted he laboured beyond his strength preaching sometimes twice or thrice aday to the poor people that hungered after the word of God Most of the reforming clergy particularly Latimer Coverdale Taylor Philpot Bradford Samson  c  were of the same mind with Hooper concerning the habits Nay even Cranmer and Ridley seem to have relaxed their bigotry and to increase the friends of reformation admitted Samson and others without them if they did not also intend to procure an act for their abolishment It is certain that when they died martyrs they contemned them And indeed it was strange for men of such piety and sense to mark such immoderate zeal for trifles in a country where John a Lasco and other foreigners were allowed to worship God in their own manner  Gardiner and his other Popish clergy did not reckon the deeds of the governing council valid nor themselves bound to obey them After he had been imprisoned for his disobedience Gardiner still behaved contemptibly and was therefore deprived of his bishoprick and sent to the Tower in which he continued prisoner till Q Mary relieved him As he and his brethren had taken out commissions for their  office only during his majesty's pleasure they could scarcely complain of such severities His deprivation and Vesay's resignation on account of his old age making way for Scory and Coverdale to fill their sees the balance of the episcopal power was in the hand of the Reformers They therefore proceeded to correct the doctrines of the church Cranmer and Ridley drew up  fortytwo articles  the same in substance with the  Thirtynine  now used After these had been corrected by some bishops and again by Cranmer they were ratified by the privy council without being presented to either convocation or parliament Along with them was printed a short Catechism composed it is said by Poinet bishop of Winchester translated by Cranmer and authorized by the kind's letters patent  The Reformers proceeded to a  second amendment  of their  Book of common prayer  A short confession of sins and absolution of the penitent introduced the daily service and a rehearsal of the ten commandments with a short pause between each while the people kneel along with a declaration That this posture did not import any adoration of the elements  ntroduced that of the  Communion  To please the Papists Elizabeth caused the last to be erazed but it was restored at the restoration of Charles II The use of oil in confirmation extreme unction prayer  or the dead in the office for burial auricular confession crossing in confirmation and the Lord's supper were laid aside The parliament appointed this  Liturgy  alone to be used through the whole kingdom after Allhallow They declared marriages of priests valid and their children capable of heirship They reunited the bishopricks of London and Westminster Alas that we should find  hem permitting fishers reapers and the like to labour on the Lord's day  Day bishop of Chichester Heath of Worcester  nd Tonstal of Durham being deprived of their office on account of disobedience to the laws Edward  appointed a visitation of all the churches and to bring in all superfluous plate  c  into the exchequer or dispose of it for the benefit of the poor Notwithstanding all this reforming care many of the courtiers were grasping at the church's property while not a few clergymen were almost starved and obliged to become kitchen clerks surveyors receivers  c  for a livelihood While many Protestants adorned their profession others were a disgrace to it Some principal Reformers were too much inclined to stretch the laws in their own favour and to persecute such as were not of their opinion Their progress in reformation notwithstanding their many powerful and crafty opponents and so deep rooted customs is an admirable display of the interposing power of the Lord  Both Edward and they intended to have proceeded further in removing the remains of Popery and in settling the government and discipline of the church In his  Diary  he laments that the ignorance scandalous lives and Popish inclinations of some of his bishops hindered his restoring of the primitive discipline in the manner he wished Bucer presented to him a PLATFORM of discipline bearing That scandalous persons should be excluded from the sacraments that the old Popish vestments should be laid aside that there should be no half communion service that godfathers should not answer in name of children to be baptized that the Lord's day should be strictly sanctified and frequent fasts but not Lent observed that bishops should apply themselves only to their spiritual employment that coadjutors should be added to some of them and each of them have a council of presbyters that country bishops should be set over twenty or thirty parishes who should often conveen their clergy and strictly inspect them that provincial Synods be held twice ayear and have commissioners from the king to observe their conduct Cranmer was much of the same mind He disliked the government of the church by convocations  in which deans archdeacons and cathedral clergy have more influence than the representatives of the real pastors of the church He appears to have drawn up a  more perfect Book of common prayer  but could not get it introduced on account of the Popish inclinations of his subordinate bishops and clergy  The reformation of the English church being now at its heighth it may be proper to observe that in their doctrine of  original sin predestination justification effectual grace  and  good works  they corresponded with Augustine and Calvin that they were not satisfied with the discipline they had obtained tho' they thought they might submit to it till it could be rectified by authority that they believed but two orders of clergy viz  bishops and deacons  and that bishops and priests were but different ranks of the same order and that they acknowledged fellowship with other Protestant churches which had no bishops and hence till the end of Elizabeth's reign they never urged any reordination of their presbyters  AS his sister MARY as well as the queen of Scots were Papists and Elizabeth had been declared  bastard by the parliament the Regents or rather  he duke of Northumberland advised Edward still  minor as he lay dying in to bequeath his  rown to Jean Gray eldest daughter to Lady Fran  es his cousin and the duke of Suffolk a lady of ex  raordinary qualities piety and zeal and next in  lood after the three princesses above mentioned The council and Cranmer himself after much op  osition to it signed this disposal of the crown To  er great grief Jean was proclaimed  queen  immedi  tely after Edward's death and an army raised to maintain her claim But Mary having by her per  dious promises to the Suffolkers and others to make  o change relative to religion deceived the people  aised an army and without any bloodshed made  her entrance into London four weeks after the death of her brother Bonner Gardiner and other Papists were immediately liberated from prison In council she solemnly declared that notwithstanding her fixedness in her own religion she would compel none to it but by the preaching of God's word Next day by his inveighing at St Paul's against the late reformation Dr Bourne so provoked his audience that his life was in danger But Rogers and Bradford at the hazard of their own carried him off safe He and his Popish friends quickly rewarded their kindness with imprisonment and burning  To prevent like tumults for the future Mary prohibited all preaching without special licence declaring that she would not compel her subjects to receive her religion till further order should be taken for it Alarmed by this universal prohibition of Protestant preaching while Papists got licences the Suffolkers depending on their merit in her enthronement and her solemn promise to them deputed some to represent their grievances to Mary She rebuked them as insolent One of them having put her in mind of her promise had for his reward three days on the pillory and his ears cut off as a defamer Bonner of London Gardiner of Winchester Tonstal of Durham Heath of Worcester and Day of Chichester were restored to their sees Hooper who had with great zeal supported the rights of Mary against Jean Gray along with Coverdale Taylor and Rogers were imprisoned for preaching after she had prohibited it Cranmer who had saved her life from her father's intended destruction of it and had contended for her claim to the crown and Holgate archbishop of York soon after shared th  same fate The foreign Protestants were commanded to leave the kingdom Bishops Poynet Barlow Scory Coverdale and Bale Deans Cox Haddon Horn Turner and Samson together with Grindal Javel Sandys Rainolds Pilkington Whitehead  Fox Rough Knox and about forty other preachers and eight hundred principal professors of the Protestant religion sled into foreign countries To prevent their escape the council sent orders to all sea ports to permit none to leave the kingdom without passports  On the first of October Mary was crowned by bishop Gardiner assisted by ten of his diocesan brethren dressed in their Romish mitres copes and  rosiers In a parliament procured to her mind by bribery and every other shameful method the laws of Edward concerning religion after a tedious de  ate of six days were wholly repealed Severe punishments were enacted against those that should  are to disturb the restored Popish worship or break down altars or images Upon the d of November  rchbishop Cranmer lord Guildford Jean Gray and  he two sons of Northumberland were indicted of high treason in attempting to set up another for queen They all confessed the charge but Cranmer appealed to his judges with what reluctance he had signed Edward's exclusion of Mary By means of new presentations to ecclesiastical livings and other methods the convocation of which Bonner was president was entirely to her majesty's taste They all agreed to subscribe the doctrine of transubstantiation except Philpot Philips Haddon Che  ey Aylmer and Young who disputed against it  hree days being answered with little more than  hreatenings and reproach Weston the prolocutor  old them that though they had the scripture on  heir side he and his friends had the sword on theirs Most of the common people were zealous even to madness for the restoration of their old idolatry and  uperstition  Provoked by Mary's apparent intention to marry Philip heir to the Spanish crown Wyat a trusty Papist in raised an army of four thousand forces against her and attempted an entrance into London His army being quickly dispersed himself  was taken and executed Pretending that his rebellion was raised by Protestant influence lady Jean Gray and lord Guildford her husband were executed The princess Elizabeth narrowly escaped Wyat to save his own life once accused her but when he saw that he must die he declared her innocent Gardiner procured a warrant from some privy counsellors for her execution but the lieutenant of the Tower would not make use of it till he had consulted queen Mary her sister She disowned it but continued her favours to Gardiner  Having got the nation somewhat settled Mary appointed her bishops to visit it and rectify disorders Her instructions for their procedure were drawn up by Gardiner After an angry recital of the innovations of Edward they were charged to execute the laws which were in force under king Henry VIII but not to proceed in her majesty's name nor exact the oath of supremacy  these encroaching on the Papal authority  to separate clergymen from their wivesto reordain such as had entered by the Form prescribed under Edward or supply the defects of their ordination by the unction priestly vestments  c  to compel all persons to attend the church The archbishop of York and bishops of St David's Chester and Bristol were deprived of their sees on account of their marriage and those of Lincoln Gloucester and Hereford by her majesty's pleasure Soon after the sixteen vacant bishopricks were filled up with candidates to her taste Multitudes of Protestant preachers were turned ou  for being married even though they were willing to leave their wives and for nonappearanceand without being heard  Philip's Spanish gold having reconciled almost at the Papists to Mary's marriage with him she has the more opportunity to persecute the Protestants As they had complained of their usage in the dis+putes of the late convocation the court resolved to mortify them with a repetition of it at a second dis+pute  before the university of Oxford Cranmer and Ridley and Latimer were taken from their prison to manage it on the Protestant side In the debate which turned upon  transubstantiation  and the  propitiatory sacrifice  of the Mass they behaved with great modesty and presence of mind but their enemies bore them down with continual shouting noise and derision sometimes four or five of them speaking all at once After all they were required to subscribe the articles of debate as if they had been vanquished They refused and on this account to their great satisfaction were declared heretics The Papists intended to have exposed them in like manner before the university of Cambridge but the three bishops above mentioned with seven others published from their prison a declaration That since they had met with so much abuse and misrepresentation at Oxford they would dispute no more unless in writing and before her majesty or council or her parliament At the same time they emitted a summary confession of their faith That the holy scriptures are the sole supreme judge of all religious debates that justification is by faith alone through the imputed righteousness of Christ that holiness of nature is necessary in order to produce good works that there is no purgatorial state after this life that baptism and the Lord's supper ought to be administered according to Christ's institution that the denial of the sacramental cup to the people transubstantiation and adoration of the elements and the sacrifice of the Mass ought to be condemned that marriage is lawful to all men And in the conclusion they charge the subjects not to rebel against the queen but to obey her cheerfully in all points not forbidden by the law of God  Gardiner's intrigues with Charles the German emperor had long kept cardinal Pole from returning to his native country but his attainder being repealed he now came home papally invested with legantine powers and in his speech to the parliament  Nov he warmly invited them and the nation to reconcile themselves with their spiritual father and return to the catholic church They readily acquiesced and had prescribed for their penance their annulment of all laws made against his Holiness' authority since the th year of Henry VIII They received the Pope's pardon of all their sins during that period on their knees and then went to the chapel royal in solemn procession and sung Te Deum and spent the rest of the day in revelling and mirth because the lost children were now recovered to the Pope The parliament supplicated his Holiness to confirm some marriages judicial processes settlements of lands and erections of bishopricks cathedrals and colleges The cardinal legate admitted their requests but denounced the heavy judgment of God against all such as did not restore all the ecclesiastical goods which they had in their hands The Pope refused to confirm Pole's restrictions and published a bull excommunicating all those who did not restore whatever they had pertaining to the church Terribly afraid of Papal damnation Mary delivered up all that was in her power Some of her subjects were not so timerous but threatened to defend their claims by the edge of their sword Mary repaired the old monasteries and erected new ones as fast as she couldmade inquiry who had pillaged them under her father and brother and commanded Bonner to craze from the public registers whatever had been done against the Pope or monks as a terrible scandal to the nation To the great joy of the Popish clergy the statute of Richard confirmed by Henry IV for  burning of heretics  was restored to its wonted vigour  It seems cardinal Pole lost the favour of the Pope for proposing to bring back the English heretics by instructions and arguments Gardiner enraged by the reprinting of his book which inculcated subjection to Henry's ecclesiastical supremacy and Mary were furiously bent upon severities and thought  that a few examples would terrify the rest into their will Hooper Rogers Sanders and Taylor were burnt in the beginning of February and eleven more in March and April Their triumphant courage and constancy confirmed their Protestant brethren and made some Papists think better of their cause The English bishops attempted to throw the odium of these executions upon king Philipwho to return it on themselves caused his Spanish confessor preach against such severities Gardiner craftily turned over the management of them upon Bonner who brutish as he was pretended to be sick of them About this time the exiles abroad by a printed paper called her majesty to remember that during her brother's reign no Papists had been put to death and even Jews were tolerated and they urged the nobles and commons to interceed with her to forbear shedding the blood of her Protestant subjects or at least allow them to leave the country This had no good effect As if Bonner had been too mild Philip and Mary by a letter quickened him to his pastoral work of extirpating heretics Accordingly in the months of June July August and September no less than twentyfour were burnt of whom holy Bradford was one Not long after Ridley Latimer and Philpot shared the same fate After being decoyed and terrified into a recantation Cranmer publicly professed his repentance of it and suffered the slames in the most couragious manner marking his grief for his fall by first burning his unworthy hand which had signed his recantation Cardinal Pole now archbishop of Canterbury on account of his mildness was deprived of his legantine powers Gardiner had died miserable in both body and mind but Bonner continued his murderous fury The year exhibited one continual series of cruel persecutions Numbers were burnt at a time because they could not believe transubstantiation and such things as are equally absurd In imitation of the Spanish Inquisition Mary erected a  court of twentyone commissioners most of them clergymen for the trial of heretics and prohibited all her subjects to pray for the persecuted Protestants or to wish that God would bless them In her reign according to Warner were burnt for religion of whom four were bishops and twentyone inferior clergymen Fiftyfour others were prosecuted for heresy seven of whom were whipt and sixteen perished in prison Lord Burleigh says that four hundred suffered publicly besides those that were murdered in prison The bones of Bucer and Fagius were digged up called to give an account of their faith and not compearing at the bar were condemned to be burnt for heresy Peter Martyr's wife having once been a nun had her bones dug up and buried in a dunghill  Meanwhile the contentions among the Reformed added to their misery While some at the peril of their lives preached to such as would attend them in the night and one congregation in London had five preachers of whom Rough the martyr and Scambler and Bentham afterward Protestant bishops were a partothers troubled their fellow prisoners with their disputes Some of them being Arians in opinion were so troublesome in the King's bench that the Marshal was obliged to shut them up by themselves Harry Hart Trew and Abingdon declaimed against all learning and Fathers and laboured to infect their companions with Pelagian errors Ridley wrote them a letter and Bradford another in order to convince them of their mistakes Careless had much conference with them for the same end They even wrote against one another in the prison I do not find that any of these  Arians  or  freewillers  dared to risk a martyrdom for truth But the contentions they raised drew reproach on the Protestant religion and made the Papists to triumph over it  Those that fled to foreign parts were no less plagued with contentions The Lutheran clergy  except Melancthon and a few others of his mild temper opposing their having shelter among them most of them fixed their residence at Embden Strasburgh Zurich Basil and some other places in Flanders Switzerland and Germany especially at Frankfort on the Mein There Whittingham Williams Sutton and Wood with their families and friends took up their abode in and were allowed by the magistrates to meet for public worship in the French church but at different hours They and the French exiles agreed to subscribe the Confession of the French Protestants and to make no quarrel one with another about rites of worship The English also agreed among themselves to forbear an  wering aloud after the minister and to drop the litany and the surplice and that after a general confession of sins they should sing a psalm and then the minister pray preach and again pray subjoining the Lord's prayer sing another psalm and dismiss the congregation with a solemn blessing Having agreed to choose a minister and deacon they invited their scattered brethren to share of their happiness As the principal preachers and students of divinity had settled at Strasburgh Zurich and Ba  il for their instruction or employment by printers the Frankforters begged them to send some of their number to be pastors and gave them an account of their platform of worship and discipline The Strasburgh divines demurring on their request they invited John Knox from Geneva Haddon from Strasburgh  nd Lever from Zurich The students at Zurich re  used to come unless they would follow the service  ook prescribed by K Edward The Frankforters  eplied That they were ready to comply with it as far as the word of God required but they did not choose to practise indifferent ceremonies in a coun  ry where they were disliked and especially as Edward had altered many things to the better and  ntended to have laid aside more of these rites Soon  fter Grindal and Chambers brought a letter from  ixteen learned exiles at Strasburgh insisting for full  conformity to the service book as neglect of it would infer a condemnation of the English martyrs▪ Knox Bale and Fox now at Frankfort and fourteen others replied That they had omitted as few ceremonies as possible that the martyrs in England were not dying for the ceremonies but believed they might be altered to the better and that the divines of Strasburgh had better not come than attempt to reduce the congregation to the use of the service book The Frankforters having consulted Calvin he replied That there were in the English liturgy many intolerable  fooleries  which godly men ought to reform as they had opportunity and that he knew not what they could mean who were so fond of the dregs of Popery where they had full liberty to establish whatever was most for edification They therefore agreed to retain their own order  About the end of April Dr Cox who had been tutor to king Edward a man of great pride and of no small credit with his countrymen and some of his friends coming to Frankfort disturbed the worship of God by answering aloud after the minister Next Lord's day one of them without the consent of the congregation mounted the pulpit▪ and read the liturgy Knox in his sermon taxed them with breach of agreement and affirmed that some things in the service book were superstitious Cox prevailed with the magistrates to forbid Knox preaching any more in that place Knox's friends applying to the magistrates they appointed the congregation to unite with the French church in both discipline and ceremonies according to their first agreement Provoked by this Cox and his friends in a manner superlatively base accused Knox of high treason against the emperor on account of some strong expressions in his  English admonition  published about four years before Unwilling to risk the emperor's resentment the senate of Frankfort respectfully desired Knox to leave the place Cox and his party strengthened by the arrival of other divines▪  procured the magistrates permission to use the service book Knox's friends offered to submit the dispute to the arbitration of foreign divines but they refused and solicited Calvin to countenance their ceremonialism He absolutely refused and told them That he saw no reason for burdening the church with such offensive and hurtful things and that their conduct toward Knox was neither brotherly nor piousand besought them to study peace among themselves This missive having no effect upon these ceremonialists the old congregation were obliged to yield and leave the place Some of them went with Fox to Basil others to Geneva where they chose Knox to be their pastor and formed their church after the model of that place They published their plan in English directed to their brethren at home and hinted that finding some rites of the service book apt to do hurt they had laid them aside as Hezekiah did the brazen serpent and the primitive church their love feasts In a few months after they had forced out their brethren Horn pastor of the new Frankforters fell into a contest with Ashby one of the principal members The elders gave judgment against Ashby He appealed to the people After the most furious and shameful contention the magistrates were obliged to interpose and order them to draw up a more perfect plan of discipline which might regulate their affairs The congregation did so and most of them subscribed it But Horn and about twelve others dissented and appealed to the magistrates After patient hearing of both parties the magistrates decided in favour of the congregation Upon which Horn and his friends left the place  In Mary died after a short reign unhappy to herself and her subjects The capture of Calais by the French bloody persecution contagious distempers excessive storms and inundations had rendered most of the nation absolutely miserable Mary was the object of her husband's contempt She  was grosly ignorant melancholy cruel and revengeful Her conscience being blindly directed by her Confessor she never but once pardoned a person accused of heresy Her parliament hated her cruelty and unwillingly granted her supplies None but the Popish clergy lamented her death  UNDER her sister ELIZABETH had run no small hazard of her life and had met with no small abuse and hardship in her imprisonment Gardiner had often moved for her death King Philip had befriended her intending it is iike to make her his queen after Mary's death She had scarcely ascended the throne when she manifested too much of her father and that she affected pompous worship and as much of the Popish religion as could consist with the maintenance of her own legitimacy and supreme headship over the church She was crowned in the Popish manner and notified her accession to his Holiness But he claimed England as a fief of the Romish see and declared it high presumption in her a bastard to think of taking the crown without his consent This produced her immediate breach with Rome As some Protestant preachers began to make use of the service book without licence the Papists took the alarm To prevent disputes she prohibited all preaching till the parliament should meet and allowed the clergy only to read the  gospels  and  epistles  for the day and the  ten commandments  in English and to repeat the  Lord'  prayer  and the  Creed  The exiles abroad prepared to return home and reconciliatory letters passed betwixt them These of Geneva insisted for an entire and mutual burial of all offences and that their brethren of Basil Strasburgh Frankfort Worms  c  would unite with them in labouring to obtain a settled form o  worship like to that of the best reformed churches▪ which they had seen They promised to join in requesting her majesty That nothing burdensome to  tender consciences might be imposed After such preparation the exiles returned home with nothing but their learning and experience Their friends abroad wrote after them beseeching them to labour to have their reformation as complete as possible at first and to lay aside all relicks of Popery otherwise they might afterward find all struggling to remove them to no purpose Jewel Cox Grindal Pilkington and others in their answers professed their concern to do so and complained that the nation were so careless about the purity of worship and that Elizabeth retained crucifixes crosses lighted consecrated candles and Popish vestments in her family and chapel and was bent to have the scriptures received upon the authority of the church But they had not courage to act up to their views or to stand by one another Such as supplely complied with her majesty's will were promoted to bishopricks  c  and such as did not after a temporary permission to preach were suspended and reduced to their former depth of poverty  The ordinary methods of procuring a parliament to the sovereign's will being taken they resumed for the crown all the first fruits and tithes which Mary had restored to the church They repealed some of the penal laws They appointed public worship in a known tongue They empowered her majesty to nominate bishops to all the vacant seesand restored to her the  supremacy  over the church which had been claimed by her father and brother and required all in public employments civil or sacred to swear an oath acknowledging the same By  this supremacy  the sovereigns did not claim a power of preaching or administering sacraments but the acts establishing and explaining it make them judges of what doctrine is to be preached they by their delegates in spiritual courts are supreme judges in points of discipline they have power to ratify canons relative to church discipline and government without consent of either convocation or parliament and to  appoint whatever ceremonies they think proper for advancing the glory of God and the edification of his church they have the sole power of nominating bishops who must be chosen and no otherand who cannot act but by royal commission No convocation can meet or act without royal indiction and appointment of their business All appeals formerly made to Rome fall into the king's chancery to be judged by his delegates Thus excepting clerical ministrations the kings of England have the same power as the Pope once had  It was next resolved to establish an uniformity of worship and ceremonies To prepare the way Elizabeth appointed nine Popish bishops to dispute in writing against as many Protestants before herself her council and houses of parliamentWhether the use of an unknown tongue in the public worship of God be not contrary to scripture and the custom of the primitive church Whether every particular church hath power to alter her own ceremonies as appears most conducive to the general edification of her members and Whether the word of God represents the mass as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the quick and the dead But the Popish doctors gave up the debate on the very first day pretending That the catholic cause ought never to be submitted to such a laical arbitration The Reformers themselves were not of one mind relative to the  ceremonies  and the  service book  Some were for introducing the Form drawn up by the Genevan exiles Others among whom Elizabeth was chief inclined to retain all the ceremonies which could possibly consist with the purity of doctrine and the independence of the church on the Pope She even appointed Parker Grindal Cox Pilkington Whitehead and some others to review Edward's second Book of common prayer and to strike out of it all passages that might offend the Pope or his friends and to make every body easy with respect to the corporal presence of Christ in his supperbut to alter nothing  in favour of scrupulous Protestants This Book thus purged or rather made worse was established by law In Edward's time  kneeling  or  standing  at the Lord's supper were held indifferent and only the surplice was at last retained Now  kneeling  was commanded  copes  and other Popish vestments as well as  festivals  and their  eves  were reappointed In these modes of worship the parliament required an exact uniformity and that whosoever unnecessarily absented from church should pay a fine of twelve pence for each fault Nor had Elizabeth been content with all this unless the parliament had empowered her to appoint what further ceremonies she found necessary Upon this rock of uniformity the still remaining corruptions and the almost perpetual divisions and often repeated persecutions of the best in the nation were founded In the convocation the Popish doctors made a considerable stand for their religion and for disburdening their consciences presented to the Lord privy seal a Remonstrance in support of  transubstantiation  the  propitiatory sacrifice of the Mass  the  Pope's supremacy  and  clergymen's  ole power to judge  of matters of faith or discipline  No sooner was the parliament dissolved in than all the bishops were required to swear the  oath of supremacy  acknowledging the queen  supreme governor of the church in all causes  Death having of  ate seasonably cut off many of them only fifteen  emained all of whom except Kitchin of Lundaff obstinately refused to take it and were therefore deprived of their sees Three of them retired to the continent and the rest were kindly treated in Eng  and Even Booner White and Watson whose hands had been most remarkably stained with Protestant blood though imprisoned had a sufficient maintenance allowed them by the queen Most of  he monks returned to secular employments while  he nuns and many others went beyond sea After  he bishopricks had remained vacant about a year in  opes of the Popish bishops conforming Whitehead  Gilpin Coverdale Knox and Samson had offers of them but they refused to accept on account of the ceremonies and vestments Grindal Parkhurst Sandys and some others accepted them with trembling in hopes of an after correction of the settlement As none of the Marian bishops would concur in the consecration of Parker to be archbishop of Canterbury it was performed at Lambeth by Barlow bishop elect of Chichester and Scorey elect of Hereford who officiated in their surplice and chimere and Coverdale once bishop of Exeter and Hodgkins suffragan of Bedford in their long gowns The ceremony was performed by prayer and laying on of hands without gloves sandals ring slippers mitre pall or any other of the Aaronical vestments How Parker such a zealous stickler for Romish apparel could be content with suth plainness I know not As the Papists terribly exclaimed against this ordination the parliament about seven years after confirmed it At first Elizabeth's bishops were poor and somewhat moderate but as their wealth increased so did their pomp and their lording it over their clerical brethren  The English reformation was now fixed but neither clergy nor people were uniform in their views The court party believed That all power of reforming the church was lodged in the sovereign who might model the doctrine worship and discipline of the church in every thing not contrary to the express statutes of the realm that the church of Rome was a true though much corrupted spouse of Christ of which the Pope was the lawful bishop in his own diocese that Christ had appointed no particular form of government in his church but had left it to magistrates to model it as best comported with the laws of their state that the pattern of the first five centuries of the Christian church was a more proper standard of church government than that of the apostles in whose time she was in a poor and infant condition and that the religious observation of things  indifferent in themselves becomes a divinely commanded duty when required by magistratesThe strict party believed it unscriptural and unreasonable to have the religion of a nation subjected to the will of any mere man that the Pope is Antichrist the man of sin and son of perdition that the church of Rome is not a true church but an idolatrous synagogue of Satan that the validity of clerical ordinations cannot safely be suspended on an uninterrupted succession of bishops in the church all along from  he apostles that the holy scriptures of the Old and New Testaments exclusive of the Apocrypha are  he standard of discipline and government as well  s of doctrine and that no regard ought to be paid  o the primitive church but what corresponds with  he Bible that nothing left indifferent by Christ ought to be imposed in God's worship by human laws  hat such rites as have been abused to idolatry or  re calculated to render men superstitious ought  ot to be reckoned indifferent but unlawful in these  ircumstances These however took the oath of supremacy in consequence of her majesty's explaining  t to mean no more than That she was head over all persons in the church to the exclusion of the Pope  nd his agents  By virtue of the act establishing her supremacy E  izabeth erected an  High Commission  court and gave  hem articles of Injunctions for visiting the chur  hes much the same as those emitted in the begin  ing of Edward's reign which were to be read in e  ery church once every quarter of a year A rule was added concerning  bidding  of silent prayers in the  hurch and another for taking away the altars and placing communion tables in their stead The ob  ervation of these injunctions was required under pain  f suspension deprivation sequestration excommu  ication  c  The most of the commissioners were  aymen and any two of them were appointed to ex  mine the state of churches suspend or deprive  nworthy clergymen and put others in their place  to proceed against the obstinate by imprisonment church censures and other legal methodsand to rectify all disorders relative to religion and benefices As Elizabeth retained in her chapel her altar crucifix and lighted candles by daythe service was sung not only with organs but with cornets and sackbuts on the solemn festivals and could not be easily distinguished from that of the Popish cathedrals the commissioners displeased her by their destroying of images and other relicks of Popery In their visitation they found that though scarcely or of the Popish clergy had quitted their livings their places could not be supplied many of the reformed exiles scrupling at the terms of uniformity required by the  Injunctions  and Elizabeth choosing rather to damn her subjects through ignorance than dispense with a relick of Popery  As her majesty was not fond of the doctrinal articles of Edward and it was yet unsafe to permit the convocation to judge of them  eleven articles  concerning the nature of God the sufficiency of the scriptures the nature of the church the power of civil magistrates the power of the Pope the rectitude of the newly corrected service book the nullity of the propitiatory sacrifice of the mass the communion in both bread and wine the unprofitableness of images relicks and feigned miracles the advantages of true holiness  c  an assent to this Confession of faith full compliance with the service book and swearing the oath of allegiance were the terms of ministerial communion Such was the obstinate bigotry of Elizabeth archbishop Parker and their agents that rather than admit a learned and godly preacher that scrupled at a Romish habit or ceremony they admitted numbers of a naughty practice and who could scarcely read prayers or sometimes an homily A  third Book of Homilies  consisting of plain discourses concerning the church▪ peril of idolatry good works fasting gluttony and drunkenness excess in apparel prayer pub+lic  worship in a known language reverence of God's word alms Christ's birth passion and resurrection worthy receiving of the Lord's supper gifts of the Holy Ghost marriage repentance idleness rebellion  c  was published for their assistance Some congregations had not a sermon in seven years and others scarcely one in twenty The translation of the Bible by the exiles at Geneva was published with a dedication to Elizabeth but as in their notes they had allowed of disobeying tyrannical magistrates and had represented bishops and archbishops as the apocalyptical locusts so much offence was taken at it that for fifteen years it could not be got reprinted In some following years about thirty editions of it were dispersed Tindal's Bible was for the present permitted till the bishops should publish a new translation The Dutch and German Protestants under John Lasco returned to London but the queen disallowing their foreign superintendent they were obliged to choose Grindal bishop of London for their head  The Popish bishops behaved rudely enough to Elizabeth but nothing could make her detest their religion She still loved images and ceremonies in the worship of God and had prohibited clergymen's marriage if Cecil afterward lord Burleigh her renowned secretary had not interposed his nervous solicitations Pope Pius IV by his nuncio offered to confirm the English  Liturgy  allow the people the sacrament in both bread and wine and annul the decree against her mother's marriage if she would return to the Romish church but she could not think of parting with her ecclesiastical supremacy Ferdinand the German emperor and others interceeded with her to allow the Papists the free exercise of their religion but she had too much policy to trust them especially as long as Mary of Scotland her rival and their favourite lived  When archbishop Parker visited his diocese in he found that most of the beneficed clergy  were either ignorant mechanics or disguised Papists many churches shut up and in several counties not a sermon preached or even a homily read within twenty miles for several months But Parker who before his advancement was humble and modest now like his mistress chose rather to have millions of souls perishing in ignorance than that a pious and learned scrupler at some relicks of Popery required by the act of uniformity should be allowed to instruct them Having finished his visitation Parker fixed the lessons of scripture for all the holy days in the year that preachers might no longer have liberty to read what they thought most edifying to their hearers or to read the oracles of God instead of apocryphal fables  To confirm the royal supremacy the parliament in appointed the oath acknowledging it to be carefully imposed on all the clergy judges and advocates and that the first refusal of it should render them  outlaws  the second render them  traitors  But Elizabeth and Parker protected most of the Papists from having occasion to refuse it They also appointed the Bible and Book of common prayer to be translated into the Welsh tongue and a copy of it provided for every cathedral and parish church in their country In the convocation many clergymen were so ignorant that they could not write their own names They agreed upon and subscribed the  Thirtynine Articles  which were afterward in part confirmed by the parliament Bishop Sandys brought in an address to her majesty beseeching her to remove out of the service or prayer book the warrant for private baptism and for baptism by womendisallow the crossing in baptism and to appoint commissioners for reforming the ecclesiastical laws Another paper subscribed by about members requested That the whole congregation should sing the psalms and organs be laid aside that none but ministers should baptize and they be allowed to forbear signing the baptized with the cross that  kneeling at the Lord's supper be held indifferent that the use of copes surplices and other Popish vestments be removed that that which relates to the punishment of nonconformists in the articles be mitigated that all holy days dedicated to the honour of creatures be abrogated or at least people have liberty to attend their ordinary work immediately after public worship This not pleasing another paper was presented requesting That all holy days except Sabbath days and festivals relating to Christ be abolished that in reading the prayers ministers turn their face to the people that they may hear and be edified that the cross in baptism be omitted as tending to superstition that many being unable to kneel at the sacrament and others kneel and knock superstitiously the order of kneeling may be left to the discretion of every ordinary that no more but the surplice be imposed in the apparel of ministers in executing their office that the use of organs be omitted After much warm disputation this paper was approved by of the most learned against of present members but absents by proxy voting against it and only for it it was lost by one vote of an absent who had heard nothing of the debate  Almost all the noted English divines had testified their dislike of the Popish vestments imposed on the clergy Sundry foreigners and particularly the Genevans had declared against them and advised to a more perfect reformation But so zealous were Elizabeth Parker and their agents that the great Martyrologist Fox and Coverdale could have no preferment and scarcely liberty to preach on account of their scrupling at such relicks of superstition or idolatry Parker who directed his clergy not to tender the oath of supremacy to Papists except in cases of necessity for fear of distressing themby Elizabeth's order drew up some advertisements which obliged every preacher to take out a new licence which could not be had without declaring  their full consent to the habits and ceremonies Ma+ny of the best still scrupling he cited them to hi  court at Lambeth admonished some and threatened others Samson and Humphreys remarkabl  for piety and learning offered to subscribe with som  limitations but could obtain none After their im+prisonment Samson was deprived of all clerical of+fice and Humphreys durst not return to Oxford Elizabeth craftily refused to annex her royal confir+mation to Parker and his brethren's advertisement concerning  habits  but ordered that all refusers o  them should be punished with suspension and deprivation from their office To prepare the way for re+ducing the puritan clergy about London John Fo  was prosecuted but it seems they were ashame  to deprive him Parker begged Cecil and some o+ther noblemen to attend him in his dealing with th  London nonconformists but they refused being a+shamed of such work Of an hundred clergymen were by threatenings and otherwise made to subscribe the terms of Conformity Thirtyseven among whom Parker acknowledged were some of th  best preachers absolutely refused and gave in thei  reasons but were immediately suspended and threa+tened with deprivation if they did not conform with in three months  The commissioners for visitation of the churche  cruelly obliged every clergyman having charge o  souls to swear obedience to all royal injunctions letters of the lords of privy council articles and in junctions of their metropolitans and mandates o  their bishops and other superiors To gird these in junctions fast upon the Puritans spies were appoint+ed in every parish to watch their conductthat ren+dered it impossible for them to escape the High com+mission By such means even London was render+ed most miserable for want of preachers Bisho  Grindal indeed prosecuted the Puritans or scruple  with the utmost reluctance and wished to indulg  them but could not for Elizabeth and especiall  for Parker Several Heads and others of the university of Cambridge once and again besought Cecil their chancellor That they might be dispensed with as to the habits which gave great offence at court Nevertheless that university was long a nest and refuge of Puritans They retained their right of sending forth twelve preachers yearly who might preach for life without any licence from the bishop which contributed to the edification of many thousand souls Meanwhile the other Puritan preachers partly fled  nto foreign countries partly betook themselves to  ecular employments or to be chaplains to persons of rank and many who had large families were  educed to beggary  When the refusers of the habits and ceremonies found themselves extremely traduced by their enemies they began to publish tracts for their own vindication The High Commissioners procured a deed of the privy council prohibiting the printing or vend  ng of them Provoked with this restraint and with the silencing sequestration and imprisonment of so many of their faithful pastors and preachers for mere scruples at the robes and ceremonies of Antichrist many of the people began so separate from the conforming clergy and meet for worship by themselves in doing which they laid aside the liturgy and followed the plan of Geneva It ought to be remembered that though the Robes were most readily spoken of amidst these contentions yet the Puritans complained of many things beside They did not allow of the office of bishops to be superior to that of presbyters or of bishops temporal dignities and secular trusts they disliked the titles and offices of  archde  ons deans chapters  and other officials in cathedral churches they condemned the exorbitant power and oppressive conduct of the bishops and their chancellors and their spiritual courts the putting of excommunication and absolution into the hands of laymen promiscuous admission of people to the Lord's table however ignorant or licentious  they lamented the total want of Christian discipline they disliked restriction of ministers to  set forms  of prayer and the vain repetitions prescribed in the  common prayers  they disliked several expressions in the office of marriage burial  c  and the reading of so much of the Apocrypha to the exclusion of a large part of the word of God they complained That there were so many unpreaching pastors so many pluralities and nonresidents and that ministers were intruded by patronage without regard to the choice of the people they detested the observation of so many holy days of human appointment while buying and selling on the Lord's day were permitted they disapproved instrumental music singing of prayers and other relicks of Papal forms in cathedral churches they scrupled the use of the cross in baptism and the officiating of godfathers and godmothers in place of the true parents they disliked the manner of confirmation upon so easy terms as well as the pretence that imposition of the bishops hands certified persons of their real saintship they disliked the obliging of communicants to kneel at the Lord's supperor to bow at the pronunciation of the name JESUS they disliked the use of the ring in marriage as a sacramental symbol nor could they believe that the use of Popish robes or ceremonies in divine service promoted the edification of men's souls  Coverdale Samson Fox Humphreys and others of the Puritan clergy continued in the church and became itinerant preachers lecturers or chaplains as they had opportunity But Coleman Button Halingham Benson White Rowland and Hawkins ministers of London looking upon the established church as obstinate in her adherence to many dregs of Popery and in persecuting the faithful followers of Christ separated from her and privately preached in houses and woods Informed of this Elizabeth published a proclamation That whoever  did not attend their own churches but attended conventicles should for the first offence be deprived of the freedom of London and afterward abide the punishment directed by law One of these private meetings being detected many were apprehended who before bishop Grindal and other judges behaved in a most bold and Christian manner After lying a year in prison twentyfour men and seven women were set free Neither the remarkable piety nor the nervous arguments nor the sufferings of these Puritans could move the High commissioners They had their spies in all suspected places to prevent their assembling for worship and prohibited all preaching in London without special licence from the bishop or archbishop  In the bishops published their Bible which was merely that of Tindal somewhat corrected and with some maps cuts and notes but they little regarded it in dealing with their scrupulous brethren Protestants being terribly prosecuted in France and the Netherlands many of them fled into England and settled in London and other trading places Regard to the erection of manufactures and care to weaken her neighbouring princes moved Elizabeth to permit them their own modes of worship She and Parker had been extremely kind to her Popish subjects and had issued directions to prevent bringing them under hardships by the imposition of the oath of supremacy To reward her kindness they now raised two rebellions against her and the Pope delivered her and all her adherents to the devil and his angels and dissolved all oaths of allegiance to her or contracts with her These things occasioned a penal statute against Papists and requiring them solemnly to protest their innocence to her But to keep them in countenance and render the Puritans equally odious the same protestation of allegiance was without the smallest shadow of reason required of them and the prosecutions chiefly carried on against them which Popish priests by counterfeiting  them sometimes promoted By oaths and interrogations they made them their own accusers And such was their candour that they made it a point to deny nothing of the truth and to declare their principles before their judges If nothing could be found chargeable upon them they were ruined by the charges of a dilatory procedure and then dismissed under obligations to appear whenever their judges should call them  In Cartwright a most learned professor of divinity at Cambridge extended the field of disputation between the Puritans and their persecuting brethren In his theological lectures he with great modesty and caution insinuated That the names and functions or  archbishops  and  archdeacons  ought to be abolished as not warranted in scripture that the scripture only warrants preaching bishops and deacons who take care of the poor that every church ought to be governed by its own minister and elders not by chancellors and officials that every minister ought to have the charge of some flock that none should solicit admission to the ministry that bishops ought not to be created by the civil magistrate but chosen by the church that in reforming churches all things ought to be reduced to the apostolic pattern that none incapable of preaching ought to be admitted to the ministry that none but ministers can lawfully administer the sacraments that Popish ordination is not valid that only canonical scripture ought to be read in the public worship of God that in public prayer all the people ought to join with the words of the minister and not pray or read each by himself that the care of interring the dead pertains not to the ministerial office that all the words and names of God being equally divine there is no reason for  standing  at the reading of the gospels or  bowing  at the mention of the name JESUS that  sitting  at the Lord's table is as lawful as kneeling or standing that baptism by women or laymen is unlawful that parents ought to present their own  children in baptism and not be obliged to answer in name of the child that women and persons under age ought not to be allowed to stand sponsors for children that the sign of the cross in baptism is superstitious that the Lord's supper ought not to be administered in private that the prohibition of marriage at certain seasons of the year is Popish and then to give licences to it for money is intolerable that clandestine marriages are inconvenient that the observation of  Lent  and other  holy days  of human appointment is superstitious and unlawful that markets and merchandize on the Lord's day are unlawful that in ordination it is sinful and ridiculous for the bishop to say  Receive thou the Holy Ghost  as if he could confer him and that kings and bishops ought not to be anointed to their office For occasional hints of this nature notwithstanding much intercession in his favour he was deprived of his office expelled the university and for two years retired to the Netherlands  Grindal being translated to the archbishoprick of York Sandys was made bishop of London Perhaps contrary to his convictions he deprived his old fellow Puritans of the poor remains of indulgence which Grindal had left them and insisted for the most rigid uniformity When the parliament met in in which Strickland and Wentworth were principal speakers some relief was intended for the Puritans Having had the  Thirtynine articles  presented to them in order to their legal establishment they waved the three articles which related to ceremonies and government and ratified such only as belonged to doctrinal points requiring all that possessed ecclesiastical livings to declare their consent to these and such as should teach any thing contrary to them to be deprived It is probable that the chuse of th article bearing That  the church hath power to decree concerning rites and ceremonies of worship and hath authority in controversies of faith  was not in the copy which they approved and it is  certain their act admitted ordination by presbyters to be valid  Though it be notoriously certain that but a small part of the episcopalian clergy did or do subscribe these articles with honesty and candour yet to distress the Puritans the convocation which sat during this parliament requested the bishops to recall all former licences to preach and to require not only a subscription of the articles but of the  Book of common prayer  and of the  ordinal  for consecration of bishops priests and deacons as containing nothing contrary to the word of Godas the condition of every new licence Contrary to law this act tho' never confirmed by the queen was violently executed by most of the bishops Meanwhile contrary to Elizabeth's inclination the Commons presented a petition for supplying a multitude of parishes destitute of preaching and for checking abounding profaneness and atheism The Elector Palatine appointed Zanchy to write to her in behalf of the Puritans But it seems archbishop Grindal durst not deliver his letter It is certain that uniformity was more and more urged Scambler and some other bishops notwithstanding their consciences were much at her majesty's will being sensible of the bad consequences of the great want of preaching and total want of church discipline permitted their clergy to enter into associations or presbyteries for promoting of both At Northampton the clergy the mayor and the justices of peace agreed upon several  Rules  for promoting Christian knowledge regulating divine services and sanctifying the Sabbath The clergy agreed upon private exercises of preaching at their meetings in order to their mutual improvement in gifts and grace  Parker still laboured at his persecuting work He sent for the principal men of the suspected clergy and told them that they must take out new licences in which they must subscribe to all the articles imposed by the late convocation The bishops of  Ely and Winchester assisted him But Grindal refused alledging that it might bring them under a  remunire  Goodman Lever Samson Walker Brown Field Johnson and others were called to  he episcopal bar and told that they must either come up to the queen's Injunctions or be deprived Beza of Geneva by letters besought the bishops to  bate their rigour and besought the Lord Treasurer  o endeavour procuring some further reformation in  he church discipline The parliament having met began to form a Bill for regulating the procedure of  he rigid bishops and for granting some relief to the  istressed Puritans Elizabeth and her bishops pre  ented them and Wentworth the principal advo  ate for religion and liberty was thrown into prison  or his parliamentary freedom And in Dee  ing Brown Brownrig Millain Clark and about  other Puritan ministers were deprived for scru  ling the episcopal impositions  Meanwhile Field Wilcox and others drew up  n  Admonition  to the parliament consisting of twen  ythree chapters relative to the superiority of bishops  ver presbyters the authority of the church in  hings indifferent the election ordination resi  ence preaching ability and apparel of clergymen the Book of common prayer and subscription  f it holy days of human appointment right prea  hing reading of the scriptures deans preaching  nd ministring the sacraments the pertinents of

it were imprisoned more than a year They published a Confession of their faith to refuse  he calumnies of Whitgift  About the same time Cartwright published a  se  ond Admonition  supplicating redress of the Puritans  rievances and representing the injustice of punish  ng men for warning the parliament without dropping  one treasonable hint Several pamphlets bein  published in defence of the  Admonition  the bishop  were obliged to answer it Whitgift chancellor o  the university of Oxford was chosen for that pur+pose and was answered once and again by Cartwright Whitgift scarcely pretended to argue from scripture but from the dictates of Fathers in the first five centuries of the Christian church while Cartwright insisted to have all things in religion regulated by scripture Having the court and bishops on his side Whitgift hunted down his antagonist with force an  calumny and obliged him to conceal himself fle  his country and live in distress and poverty Eve  when he was rewarded with his bishoprick he coul  not forbear persecuting him a shrewd evidence that his evil conscience knew that he had not rational or scriptural arguments to support his cause  While France was socked with the blood of massa+cred Protestants the state of the Protestant religio  in England was most wretched Pleasing Parker i  their ready compliance with surplices copes squar  caps  c  the Papists had easy access to ecclesiastica  functions The clergy busied themselves in addin  to the number of their livings but almost utterl  neglected their duty and alienated the church pro+perty for their own private gain The court was a  harbour of atheism profaneness and every kind o  licentiousness Many of the subjects were absolut  atheists or heathens in their practice The Lord▪ day was generally little regarded and some live▪ without any appearance of worship at all on it But  was not against these heavendaring crimes but again  Puritans disconformity to things which themselve  allowed to be intrinsically indifferent that Elizabet  and her darling bishops burned with zeal On  Burchet a madman who was but called a Puritan having struck one and killed another whom his de+lirious brain fancied to be Hatton a Papist the odium of the deed was charged on the whole body of Puri+tans Provoked with their application to parliamen  or redress of their terrible oppression and with  heir holding of secret presbyteries among themselves  e commanded to prosecute them with unrelenting  gour Field Wilcox and five others were derived for scrupling to subscribe promises of confor  ity drawn by the commissioners Outlandish men  ho could scarce read the English tongue were  aced in their stead and their poor people who  ad enjoyed two sermons every Sabbath had scarce  one in a quarter of a year Johnson was thrown  nto prison where he died amidst poverty and hun  er Notwithstanding the reluctance of Parkhurst  ishop of Norwich Parker's commissioners deprived  bout Puritan pastors in his diocese alone  Nor were the clergy alone plagued with subscrip  ons One was devised for such as deserted their  hurches in which they engaged to full conformity  pies were placed in every suspected parish to inform  gainst such as did not punctually attend their chur  hes in order to have them punished Nay spies  ere placed upon the Puritan prisoners in order to  ring them into more trouble When the Puritans  ppeared before the High commissioners they were  bused as if they had been dogs or devils which no  oubt sometimes provoked them to some unadvised  ords The candid  Warner  justly observes That  he cruelties exercised by the court bishops against  heir worthy brethren of the same faith fell little  hort of these exercised by bloody Bonner against the Protestants Some of the persecuted offered to dis  ute the points which they held and for that crime were the more readily deposed and imprisoned As  he presbyteries prophesyings or meetings of cler  ymen to exercise their preaching talents for mutual  mprovement were thought to have a puritanical  ppearance Elizabeth and Parker contrary to the will of the privy council resolved to stop them To  he great grief of the pious Parkhurst they were first  uppressed in his diocese Some of the Puritans rec  oning it better to meet together on holy days and  other occasions for joint prayer and reading of th  scripture than to spend the time idly or in drinking and playing at cardsParker being informed of it applied himself to suppress that supercriminal conduct As he readily believed every reproach he could hear of the Puritans his steward and one Undertree forged letters in name of Benham Stonden and others importing a plot against lord Burleigh the treasurer and that the earls of Bedford Leicester and other noblemen were in it Parker began to prosecute the Puritans with great fury But upon examination Undertree confessed that the whole was a sham intended to disgrace the Puritans This not a little sullied the honour of Parker but hi  impudence preserved him from blushing and neither of the villains who had been guilty of such enormous forgery were punished To the great hur  of the isle of Wight and hindering of foreign Pro+testants to dwell or trade in it Parker visited it▪ turned out the nonconformists and shut up thei  churches Jersey and Guernsey lying out of hi  reach and having no fixed form of church government the people caused Cartwright and Snape to draw up a plan which they observed till James I▪ obliged them to receive the episcopal yoke and th  ceremonies attending it It appears to have bee  much like to that of the Westminster Assembly  While Elizabeth and her favourites carried on thei  persecution of the pious and peaceable Puritans sh  marked an astonishing kindness to Papists who sough  the ruin of herself and her kingdom They wer  frequently released from prison About of thei  meetings for idolatrous worship were connived at Nine foreign colleges being erected for the Popis  education of English youth one at Rome and eigh  in the Spanish dominions swarms of Romish missio+naries poured themselves into England In a few years that of Rome and of Douay in Flanders fur+nished three hundred all of them deep sworn to la+bour to their uttermost in reducing their heretica  countrymen to the religion of their ancestors About this time Henry Nicolas founded his  Family of  ove  whose enthusiasm rendered them almost deliri  us Their opinions were somewhat like to these of  he Popish Quietists or the Quakers They had  heir private meetings for worship on account of which they sometimes tasted of Elizabeth and Parker's wholsome severities Some German Anabaptists  aving fled into England twentyseven of them were apprehended nine banished and two burnt  bout the time that Parker himself was dragged by  eath before the tribunal of God  In the beginning of A D pious Grindal  as translated to Canterbury Sandys to York and  ylmer once an half Puritan but now a cruel per  ecutor to London In parliament an unsuccess  ul attempt to lay a tax on such as did not attend the  hurches and receive the sacraments was made  he convocation framed articles of admission to the  inistry thirteen of which were published with Eli  abeth's leave though they had not her seal one  f them declaring That all licences to preach dated  revious to Feb had become void but might  e renewed without any expence Thus for the  ird or fourth time Elizabeth had disqualified all  e preachers of her kingdom chiefly in order to  rge out Protestant scruplers at Popish vestments  d ceremonies Had all the bishops been equally  rict in the renovation of licences the church had  d scarce any preaching that deserved the name any of those who had the charge of souls being in  pable even to read an homily aright and they were  ly obliged to read the service and administer the  craments in person once in the half year under the  nalty of five pounds to the poor But it was a  ercy that many of them employed Puritans as  eir curates and lecturers who with great earnest  ss laboured in the work of the Lord Notwith  nding all attempts to root them out the Puritans  ll continued if not increased under their hardships  Many of them held secret meetings for discipline Informed hereof Elizabeth commanded archbishop Grindal to hunt them out Some of their chiefs were apprehended Others chiefly in the diocese of Norwich of which Freke was now bishop were suspended Nor could the distinguished piety and peacefulness of Greenham prevent hi  going with the rest  In order to preserve the useful meetings for mutual improvement among his established clergy Grindal drew up for them the following regulations That they should only be held in churches appointed by the bishop of the diocese that the archdeacon or some other appointed by the bishop should moderate in them that the bishop should have a list o  all clergymen fit for attending them and should appoint the passages of scripture to be handled in them  that the moderators should appoint such clergymen as could not yet preach some other useful task tha  if any in his discourse touched the affairs of state th  moderator should immediately stop him and delat  him to his bishop that if any inveigh against th  ceremonies he shall be suspended from preaching  till his bishop give him a new admission that n  minister once suspended or deprived be suffere  to speak in these meetings till by subscription an  daily practice for a time he conform to the order o  the church and that no laymen should be permi  +ted to speak in public By these regulations h  thought they would be innocent enough But E  +zabeth sending for him exclaimed against all suc  meetings as  illegal  in themselves and  infinitely dang  +rous  to both church and state for the advantage  both which she said it would be to have but thr  or four preachers in a whole county and she peremptorily commanded him to suppress them wholl  As with the most evident marks of high disple  +sure she refused to hear his reply Grindal wrote h  a most sensible letter representing the usefulness  these meetings on account of which he had n  reedom to suppress them and begging that her majesty would not interpose her prerogative in eccle  astical affairs without the advice of her bishops or  ronounce so peremptorily in religious as in secular matters Quite infuriated by this meek Remon  rance she by a deed of her Starchamber confin  d him to his house sequestrated him from his ju  isdiction for half a year Before this elapsed Grin  al made a kind of submission but as he could not  etract his opinion nor profess his sorrow for the  dvice which he had given her majesty she conti  ued his sequestration and so the exercises for  rophesying went downElizabeth being terrified  est knowledge should make her clergy less disposed  o an absolute submission to her arbitrary will  Cartwright being preacher to the English factory  t Antwerp got Fenner Travers Ashton and others  rdained to the ministry who could not obtain it at  ome where in Whitingham and Laurence were deprived for their want of episcopal ordination The woful condition of England was almost inex  ressible In Cornwal there were incumbents  ot one of which could preach a sermon and most of them pluralists nonresidents fornicators adul  erers drunkards gamesters on the Lord's day and  et people were prosecuted if they attended a Puri  an sermon  When the parliament met in the Commons  greed to observe a  fast  by themselves on a Lord's  ay to supplicate his direction in their work and  he preservation of her majesty and the realm now when the Popish powers were forming leagues for the  tter destruction of Protestants but they referred  he nomination of the preachers to the privy council Elizabeth was terribly offended that they had dared  o do this without her consent asked and obtained The Commons submitted themselves and begged her pardon The parliament enacted That all Romish priests who attempted to seduce Protestants  nd these seduced by them into a change of their  religion should be liable to the pains of high treason  and the saying of mass be punishable with a year's imprisonment and a fine of marks sterling and the hearing of it with a year's imprisonment and a forfeiture of marks And that every person who did not attend churches in which the common prayer is regularly used shall forfeit to her majesty pound  a month and ly in prison till it should be paid and schoolmasters forfeit pounds and be imprisoned for a year and be perpetually incapable of teaching a school And as some Puritans provoked with their terrible oppression had published some satyrical pamphlets against unpreaching clergymen  c  they enacted That all such as wrote or published any ballad or letter containing any thing scandalou  against the queen should suffer death without benefi  of clergy  By his questions and demands of subscription Aylmer made terrible havock among the clergy abou  London Such as did not answer to his satisfaction were immediately suspended and silenced Whil  the bishops drove the Puritans from their pulpit  many of the nobility and gentry took them into thei  families to teach their children which by the ble  +sing of God prepared them to make such a stan  for religion and liberty about the middle of the nex  century Violent methods but drove the dissente  further from the establishment Robert Brown  schoolmaster having published a tract intituled  T  life and manners of true Christians  was prosecuted o  account of it After a little rest he and Harriso  travelled through the country preaching again  bishops and ceremonies for which he was impriso  +ed above thirty times He and his followers forme  themselves into a particular sect but they we  quickly obliged to retire to Holland After offic  +ating for some years as their pastor Brown himse  returned to England and became an idle dissolu  conforming rector at Northampton His aposta  dissolved his congregation at Middleburg but th  friends of his scheme gradually multiplied They held much the same doctrine as the church of England but they denied her to be a true church on account of her many corruptions and renounced all communion with her and every other church not of their own model they placed the whole power of church government equally in all the brotherhood They chose and ordained their own officers and deprived them of their office at pleasure Their particular congregations lived as sister churches but none had any jurisdiction over another nor had their church officers any power of office without the bounds of the congregation in which they were last chosen and ordained They hated all prescribed forms of prayer Every brother had liberty of prophesying or exhorting in their religious assemblies After a sermon the brethren ordinarily conferred upon the subject of itTyler Coppington and Hacket leading Brownists in England were imprisoned several years and the two last hanged  About multitudes of Jesuits pouring into England preached openly against Elizabeth's title and authority and dispersed their books Campian and two others were apprehended and hanged but the zeal of the courtiers ran out chiefly against the Puritans The remarkably pious Wright was deprived and imprisoned because he had received presbyterial ordination at Antwerp To extend their oppression Elizabeth employed some hungry courtiers to examine the claims of lands and livings belonging to the church and granted every thing for which churchmen could not produce legal titles to them By examination of parsons wardens and others they bade fair to find means to sequestrate most of the church lands for her majesty's use The bishops were therefore obliged to beg her superseding of their commission The Suffolk justices of peace ventured again to supplicate her indulgence toward the Puritans and complained That they were reckoned with the vilest malefactors Some conform  clergy also wrote in their favour But Elizabeth Aylmer and other court bishops who connived at or encouraged profane swearing and the most open drunkenness revelling and gaming on the Lord's day panted for their ruin  Notwithstanding his further submission and removal of his sequestration Grindal continued the object of Elizabeth's dislike and hence lived in a dejected manner till he died in Whitgift of Worcester who had distinguished himself by his hatred of the Puritans was placed in his stead He had scarcely received his archbishoprick when Elizabeth solemnly charged him to restore the discipline of the church and the established uniformity which had lost its credit under his predecessor Prepared for obedience he the very first week dispatched his mandates to all the bishops of his province That no preaching catechising or prayer be allowed in families in which more than the members are present that none preach and catechize unless he read the whole service and administer the sacrament four times a year that all preachers and others in eccle  iastical orders wear the prescribed habits at all times that none be allowed to preach but such as have been regularly ordained that none preach unless he have taken the oath of supremacy subscribed the  Books of common prayer  and of  ordination of bishops priests and deacons  and all the  Thirtynine articles  and use said books in all their ministrations Several lawyers thought that he exceeded his legal powers and might have been brought into a  premunire  for tendering articles and requiring subscriptions not warranted by parliament But having her majesty on his side he insisted on them at pleasure and for refusing of them preachers were suspended in the counties of Norfolk Suffolk Sussex Essex Kent and Lincolnshire besides great numbers in London the diocese of Peterborough and other countiessome of whom were dignitaries in the church and most of them graduates in the university Fortynine of  them were immediately deposed from their office No doubt multitudes twisted their conscience to make it submit rather than render them and their families outwardly miserable The bulk of the inferior clergy who had any sense wished for amendments in the  service book  that the many valuable men thereby disqualified might be of use in the church But Whitgift was deaf to all they could say being terrified lest amendments might make people think the church had once been in a mistake  The ejected clergymen and others that pitied them presented a supplication to the privy council for some relief in the affair of subscription But Whitgift who by turning Papist under queen Mary had retained his place was firmly resolved to display his power and execute his fury against all such as had not consciences as flexible as his own Not content with archiepiscopal jurisdiction he besought her majesty for the sixth time to erect an  High Commission  whose power might extend to the whole kingdom and might apply wholsome severities not becoming bishops as such she readily granted his request This court consisted of members of which were bishops and three a quorum They had power to call before them all ecclesiastical causes to examine persons upon oath concerning their own conduct and to suspend deprive imprison or excommunicate them as they found cause and to amend the statutes of colleges cathedrals grammar schools and other public foundations They borrowed the examination of men upon oath touching their own principles or conduct from the Spanish Inquisition and their powers were manifestly inconsistent with the laws of the land But who durst contradict her majesty and the archbishop who composed twentyfour articles directing this court how to examine the Puritans upon oath Shocked with a sight of them lord Burleigh wrote to the archbishop That they favoured strong of the Romish Inquisition if they were not more ensnaring Whitgift returned him  some pitiful pretences in support of his oath  ex offices  The privy council represented to him and Aylmer and by naming the persons That they connived at pluralists nonresidents and multitudes of ignorant and scandalous clergymen drunkards whoremongers gamesters at cards and the like and only exercised their inquisitorial diligence against such as were laborious and diligent preachers Whitgift attempted to vindicate his conformists while he carried on his furious career against such as had scrupulous consciences Beale the clerk of the privy council had his own share of harrassment for exposing the illegality and injustice of his inquisitorial procedure  With no small difficulty the Puritans obtained a kind of conference on the disputed points between the archbishop and his brother of Winchester on the one side and Messrs Sparke and Travers on the other before the earl of Leicester and lords Gray and Walsingham They conferred concerning the reading of the  Apocrypha  instead of the word of God and as equivalent to itthe administration of baptism in private and by women the usefulness of Popish vestments the allowance of insufficient clergymen nonresidence and pluralities Neither party were satisfied but the noblemen were so far convinced that they solicited favour for the nonconformist ministers Meanwhile Aylmer prosecuted them with unrelenting fury Without the smallest shadow of a crime and after abusing them at his bar with the vilest reproaches he suspended thirtyeight of them in summer and afterwards prosecuted others Being turned out of their livings and hindered to keep schools some of them were reduced to beggary While Cartwright was correcting a plan of regular discipline among themselves which Travers had drawn up about eight years beforethey applied to the parliamentto the convocation to Whitgift  and again to the parliament for redress of their  grievances In their last supplication they shew that the ten thousand parishes in England had no more than about two thousand preachers to supply them On both occasions the parliament shewed willingness to relieve them But Elizabeth and Whitgift carried all before them and Wentworth and other who boldly inveighed against the bishops arbitrary procedure were sent prisoners to the Tower  In the parliament appeared exceedingly desirous to grant them libertyto restrain the High Commissionto prohibit pluralities and nonresidence of clergymen and some bills were presented  ur limiting the power of bishopsallowing of persons to marry at any time of the yearand for the better observation of the Lord's day which was now  erribly profaned But the zeal of Elizabeth and  er bishops and Whitgift's fears that alterations would make people think the church had been in an  rror prevented all such endeavours from having  ny effect An act was made against Jesuits and traf  icking priests and such as supported or concealed  hemIn the parliament appeared still  ore zealous to relieve the supplicating Puritans  nd some members proposed a farther reformation  f the church Not only did Elizabeth commit the  armest speakers to the Tower but in her plan of  eneral pardon she excepted all such as offended a  ainst the act of uniformity or published seditious  bels  i e  tracts which represented the arbitrary  rocedure of the bishopsAbout this time the d  art of the preachers in England were suspended o  eprived about five hundred of whom agreed to  bserve the plan of government and discipline which  artwright had corrected which is pretty similar to  at agreed upon by the Assembly of Westminster  nd they agreed to meet in classical presbyteries once  six weeksin synods once every half year and  a general synod or assembly once every year  fter Sandys archbishop of York had for several  years cruelly persecuted the scruplers he died A D declaring in his latter will That he was and had alway been persuaded that the ceremonies were not expedient for the church but ought to be disused by little and little Much about the same time died Fox Samson and Humphreys noted Puritans  While the Spaniards were preparing to invade and conquer the kingdom the Puritans who had alway distinguished themselves for the Protestant and national interests again supplicated the parliament for relief But Elizabeth who was flattered as a  goddess  by the convocation reprimanded the commons for considering whether they should grant it and how they might correct the fearful profanation of the Sabbath When the fears of the Spanish invasion were over by means of a storm and sea fight some less serious Puritans published some scurrilous tracts against the bishops and their procedure and ceremonies under the titles of  Martin Mar Prelate  c which were answered by churchmen in an equally ludicrous and abusive manner At last the nonconformists press was discovered and Sir Richard Knightly and Sir Wigston who had entertained it and the Printer and Newman the disperser were deeply fined in the Starchamber Others were put to death of whom Udal a pious and learned minister was one who had no hand in the scurrilous pamphlets but in a  demonstration of the discipline of the Christian church  in which the character of the bishops was thought to be touched at least he acknowledged a  great part of that book to be true Notwithstanding much intercession in his behalf he was terribly persecuted and condemned as a traitor without either shadow or proof of his disloyalty and died in prison Meanwhile Whitgift commenced a new visitation and framed twentytwo  articles  on which the wardens of every parish were to be examined upon oath and which were remarkably calculated to distress the Puritans and set every one at odds with his neighbour  In his letter to Burleigh Sir Francis Knolles calls them  Articles of Inquisition  highly prejudicial to the royal prerogative  The Puritans associations for government and discipline among themselves exposed them to further persecution Cartwright and fifteen others were apprehended and imprisoned in the Fleet jail Their first answer not being to the taste of the managers they had articles exhibited against them and were required upon oath to declare how far they were chargeable or not For having enough of common sense to refuse being self accusers they were punished with several years imprisonment James king of Scotland interceeded with Elizabeth Dr Goad and Whitaker noted clergymen with lord Burleigh and nine of the imprisoned ministers with Whitgift for relief As the archbishop refused to favour them unless they renounced their discipline and engaged themselves to complete conformity with the church they applied to her majesty and largely vindicated themselves from the reproaches cast upon them What effect this application had I know not but Cartwright was liberated and restored to his hospital in Warwick while Fenner Field Travers and many others continued in prison and their families were starvingStone Perkins Johnson and too many other Puritan clergy answered upon oath and informed their persecutors of their assemblies and discipline thus purchasing their own ease at the hazard of their brethrenTo render the Puritans odious Hacket who imagined himself to be Jesus Christ and Coppinger and Arthington his prophets with every other enthusiast were represented as of their number but Cartwright vindicated them from all connection with such  When the parliament met in Elizabeth notified to them That every thing relative to the church was to be left to her Attorney Morrice who had just before published  Reasons against the oath ex officio  and proved it contrary to scripture  the practice of heathen persecutors the laws of the land and her majesty's prerogative ventured to propose an Enquiry into the bishops procedure in their spiritual courts in compelling men to their inquisitions and subscriptions and to take an oath for accusing themselvesor in degrading depriving and imprisoning people at their pleasure and he offered two bills one against the oath  ex officio  and another against illegal imprisonments Sir Francis Knolle  seconded him For this presumption both of them were banished from the court Morrice was deprived of his chancellorship in the duchy of Lancaster and of all power to act as a lawyer and was for several years detained in prison Elizabeth told the parliament That her power over them was absolute and she would allow no such bills to be exhibited Terrified by the sate of Morrice and Knolles the parliament submitted and to pacify her enacted Tha  all persons above sixteen years of age that refused to attend their established churches or who had any hand in promoting nonconformity should without allowance of bail be imprisoned till they made a proper confession of their fault and engaged to uniformity that if they did not so within three months they should be for ever banished the kingdom and that if they did not leave it within the time prescribed or did ever return they should suffer death without benefit of clergy Meanwhile the Papist were condemned to banishment or to confinemen  within five miles of their residence  To evade the cruel force of this terrible act th  moderate Puritans came to church when the com+mon prayers were over and received the Lord's sup+per in churches in which some latitude with respec  to the table posture was allowed The Brownist fell under the whole weight of it One of their con+gregations being discovered about sixty or sevent  of them after manifold harrassments were throw  into different prisons After a most cruel imprison+ment Barrow a gentleman Greenwood and Penry  ministers all remarkable for piety were hanged as traitors But their dying professions of their loyalty and the total want of evidence to the contrary made their most effronted adversaries even Elizabeth herself almost ashamed of their groundless calumny and murder About seventeen or eighteen other Brownists died in their prisonsMeanwhile though the Papists had raised several insurrections against her though they had supported Mary of Scotland's right to her crown and after her death that of the Infanta of Spainand had concurred with the Spanish invaders in Elizabeth either from love or from fear generally used them as her dear children During the first eleven years of her reign not one of them was capitally prosecuted During the next eleven notwithstanding the Pope's excommunication above mentioned and repeated rebellions no more than twelve priests were executed almost every one for crimes relating to the state For the next ten notwithstanding multitudes of Jesuits laboured to their uttermost in seducing the subjects to join the Spaniards no more than fifty priests were executed and fiftyfive banished During the last twelve years of her reign they had almost as much freedom to profess practise and propagate their idolatries and superstitions as they could have wished  Till about A D the English Protestants had all believed That the superiority of diocesan bishops above presbyters was merely founded on the laws and inclinations of men Bancroft now chaplain to archbishop Whitgift to the great offence of the Puritans and others in a sermon pled for the  divine right  of it About he Bilson Bridges Cosins and Saravia published their  Defences  of episcopal powers and notwithstanding the restraint of the Press were answered by Bradshaw Fenner Mortice the attorney and Beza The learned but poor Hooker published the first four books of his  ecclesiastical polity  in which he chiefly attempts to prove That the scriptures are not the rule of church  discipline and government and that therefore she may appoint whatever forms or ceremonies she judgeth most conducive to edificationIn Fletcher succeeded Aylmer in the bishoprick of London In his first visitation of his diocese he set out with twenty seven  articles of Enquiry  for church wardens concerning their preachers by means of which he quickly replenished the prisons which for a little had been tolerably emptied with Puritan preachers It happened well that his marriage drew upon him Elizabeth's displeasure suspension of him from his office and banishment from the court These breaking his proud heart he was succeeded by the still more unmerciful Bancroft  The learned Ainsworth Johnson Smith Robinson and Jacob principal leaders among the Brownists having before fled to Holland multitudes followed them and erected churches according to their own plan at Amsterdam Arnheim Middleburg Leyden and other placesAbout this time Dr Bound published a tract on the  due sanctification of the Lord's day  All the Puritans relishing his sentiments distinguished themselves by their Sabbath behaviour Hereon the customary shooting fencing bowling interludes and Maygames and Morrisdances on it began to be disused and disliked This exceedingly galled the clerical managers and their agents who hated every appearance of strict piety Archbishop Whitgift and judge Popham called in the copies of Bound's book and prohibited the reprinting of it This made it more read than ever not without remarkable success  Meanwhile Barret a fellow of the university o  Cambridge in a discourse to the clergy declared himself against the Calvinistical doctrines of predestination and perseverance in grace The heads of the university obliged him to retract and Whitgift Hutton of York and some others drew up the  articles of Lambeth  'which bear That God not moved by any foreseen faith or good works of men bu  of his mere good pleasure hath chosen some particular persons to everlasting life all of whom and no other certainly obtain it that saving grace is not bestowed upon all men that no man can by the power of his free will come to Christ and be saved that justified persons have assurance of remission of sins and of eternal salvation that true saints never fall totally nor finally from their state or exercise of grace Had not Whitgift and his friends for their own sake implored Elizabeth's forbearance she had brought the formers of these articles which she disliked or who required the students to assent to them under the statute of  premunire  She was nevertheless highly offended with Dr Baro a Frenchman for continuing the debate in favour of Barret and at last obliged him to resign his professorship The university of Oxford harmonized in sentiment with that of Cambridge and Calvin's Institutions were publicly read by order of the convocation About the same time the learned Broughton Bilson and others had a warm dispute Whether Christ suffered the wrath of God in his soul and Whether he descended to the local hell After the disputants had fatigued themselves the controversies were dropt in both the universities  Towards the latter end of Elizabeth's reign hopes of approaching redress from the apparent heir to the crown somewhat quieted the Puritans Afraid of having their cruelties returned on their own heads by a Puritan sovereign the ruling clergy delivered over the prosecuted into the hands of the civil judges some of whom handled them in a furious and brutal manner During her very last years the dispute seemed almost hushed and the Puritans increased to about fifteen hundred preachersThe Popish missionaries also notwithstanding their furious contentions between the seculars and the Jesuits laboured with great diligence and no inconsiderable success The parliament which met in renewed their attacks upon the power of the spiritual courts Pluralities  nonresidences procedure  ex mero ossi  ▪ exchange of penance for money and other clerical corruptions But Elizabeth interposing prohibited them to debate the cause and referred it to the archbishop who was at some pains to render the clerical courts more circumspectAt last she died in She was extremely haughty and took a pleasure in manifesting her power and authority especially over the consciences of her subjects She never appears to have struck at any dissimulation which served her own purposes Regard for her own supremacy chiefly hindered her from being a Papist She was not much more mercifully disposed to Protestants of a tender conscience than Mary her sister Her improvement of the great abilities of some of her statesmen so as to make their suggestions seem her own was the principal ornament of her reign Pomp and power not the glory of God or the welfare of souls appear to have been the governing motives of her darling clergy Many of her ruling bishops were no less truly persecutors than the Popish ones under Mary had been It however grieved them much that Elizabeth was no friend to the clerical wealth  JAMES VI of Scotland had no sooner succeeded as nearest heir to the crown of England than all the different parties courted his favour Whitgift and his fellow bishops dispatched Henry Nevil dean of Canterbury to assure him of their unfeigned loyaltyand to recommend their church to his care and to beg his command relative to their spiritual courts He returned them answer That he intended to support their government as Elizabeth had left it The Papists welcomed him to England and put him in mind that he had been born and baptized a member of their catholic church which he had called his spiritual motherand for whose religion his royal mother had died a martyr The foreign Protestants had a kind reception and his promise of  maintaining their religious liberty As in Scotland  ames had long professed himself a Presbyterian and  n some occasions had extolled the Scotch form of worship and government to the highest the Puritans  oped for remarkable relief under his shadow About eight hundred of their ministers out of twentyfive counties presented to him that which was called the  Millenary petition  in which they begged That the cross in baptism the interrogations put to infants and their confirmation by bishops might be  aid aside that the use of the cap and surplice might be no more urged that persons should be examined before admission to the Lord's supper that the use of the ring in marriage might be omitted that the  common prayer  might be abridged that the sing  ng in churches might be modified to better edifica  ion that the profanation of the Sabbath might be restrained and the observation of other holy days  ess strictly urged that none but canonical scripture might be read in the public worship of God that ministers may not be charged to direct their people  o bow at mentioning of the name JESUS that none be admitted to any charge of souls but such as are able and obliged to preach on the Lord's day that such present incumbents as cannot preach be either removed or obliged to maintain preachers in their stead that pluralities and nonresidence be prohibited that clergymen's marriage be declared lawful and that they be only required to subscribe the  articles of religion  and the  oath of supremacy  that bishops give up their  commendams  that impropriations annexed to bishopricks and colleges be only bestowed upon incumbent preachers that a sixth or seventh part of the impropriation be assigned for a maintenance to the preacher that no church censures be administered by mere laymen chancellors  c  that none be excommunicated for Twelve pencematters or without consent of their pastor that ecclesiastical processes be abridged and some Popish canons abrogated that the oath  en officio  requiring men to be  their own accusers be more sparingly used that licences for clandestine marriages be more rarely granted  c  Stung to the very heart by this reforming petition and terribly afraid of losing their impropriations the university of Cambridge enacted That all such as in any matter or manner opposed the established doctrine or discipline should  ipso facto  be suspended from whatever degrees they had obtained and be for ever incapable to receive any The university of Oxford published a vindication of the corruptions complained of in this petition and tho' exclusive of Puritans and dignified clergy not any great number of the incumbents were much removed from gross ignorance or even capable of a regular admission to the Lord's table they boasted that all the other Protestant churches could not afford so many learned men as England alone Other petitions like to the above mentioned were presented to his majesty and several papers enforcing them published to which their opponents quickly returned answers The conformists much dreaded the ensuing parliament Whitgift wished rather to account to God for hi  conduct than to it and actually died before it met  James heartily hated these Puritans and their reformations But that he might more plausibly par  with them he appointed a conference between them and their opponents at Hampton court in the mid+dle of January Archbishop Whitgift eigh  other bishops and eight or ten other learned digni+taries were appointed to defend the cause of th  conformistswhile no more than John Reynolds whom his brother William had converted from I'd pery while himself became a Papist and Spark doctors of the university of Oxford and Chadderto  and Knewstubs of Cambridge were allowed to main+tain the cause of the Puritans James himself wa  moderator and his courtiers were witnesses O  the first day the Puritans were not admitted bu  his majesty represented to the bishops what he ap+prehended  wrong in their service book Bancroft falling on his knees begged that nothing in it might be altered lest the Papists and Puritans should triumph over them as acknowledging that they had formerly been in an error Nevertheless to satisfy James they added some words in the office of  confirmation  and  absolution  And they agreed to consider Whether the administration of baptism should be restricted to lawful ministers and midwives who were ordinarily known to administer it in a due manner On the second day the Puritan doctors being admitted Reynolds was their principal speaker He insisted that some few words in the  Thirtynine articles  might be added explained or omitted that the confirmation of children by the bishop be considered that plurality of benefices might be disallowed and preaching ministers every where settled that the reading of the Apocrypha in the public worship of God instead of his own wordthe baptismal interrogation relative to the infantthe sign of the cross in baptismthe superstitious vestmentsthe symbolical ring in marriageand the purification of childbearing women ought to be abolished because relicks of Popery He also complained of excommunications by lay chancellors and intreated that clergymen be allowed to meet together every three weeks for their mutual improvement  During this conference Bancroft again fell upon his knees and begged that schismatics might not be suffered to speak against their bishops and that his majesty would provide a ministry which could read prayers and homilies for they had too much preaching already in which many dared to vent their malice against their superiors The conformist disputants scarcely needed to open their mouths Proud of his theological abilities James chiefly with hectoring and bluster so confounded the Puritan doctors that even Reynolds that miracle of learning sunk far below his ordinary dignity reckoning i  vain to oppose the torrent of royal though often  pitiful abuse At the end James told them that since they had no other objections he would make them conform or drive them out of his kingdom To his inconceivable satisfaction he had his labour extolled by Bancroft and others as if in wisdom he had almost exceeded Solomon himself and had never had a royal equal since our Saviour's birth On the third day the conformists satisfied him concerning the High Commission and the oath  ex officio  which was the more easy as they appeared to belong to his own prerogative When he extolled the wisdom of their institutions Whitgift cried out that undoubtedly his majesty spoke by the direction o  the Spirit of God  In consequence of this conference a committee was appointed to devise regulations for lessening the charges of the High Commission and for planting schools and for settling proper ministers in Ireland in which the Popish party had been lately reduced and on the borders of Scotland and England wher  theft robbery and other disorders exceedingly prevailedThe Puritans refused to be concluded by thi  mock conference The disputants on their side had not been chosen by them nor thought many thing sinful which their brethren didnay had refused to represent these to his majestynor had they been permitted to debate the points which they had men+tioned in any proper manner They complained that Barlow in his narrative published without th  knowledge of his Puritan opponents had given  most unfair account of the conference and modestl  confuted whatever the bishops had said in a Repre+sentation directed to his majesty But for their ef+fectual conviction James without consulting eithe  parliament or convocation by his royal proclamation commanded their complete uniformity in the use  the  Service Book  as now corrected Whitgift die  about six weeks after this conference and tw  months after Cartwright his more valuable anta+gonist  James being naturally fond of absolute power the flatteries of his conforming clergy tempted him to exercise it Before the parliament met he by a proclamation charged all the Jesuits and Popish priests to leave the kingdom but carefully informed the world that it was not on account of their religion but for their maintaining the Pope's power over princesAnd by another he commanded all the Puritans to conform immediately or underly the extremities of law In his speech to his first English parliament he acknowledged the Popish to be his mother church though defiled with some infirmities and blots and declared himself ready to indulge the Popish clergy if they but renounced the Pope's supremacy and his pretended power to dispense with the murder of sovereigns and that he would be glad to meet Papists half way in order to union but eagerly declared Puritans unsupportable in any well governed state He moreover informed the parliament of his hereditary right to the crown and that he was answerable to none but God for his conduct The parliament quickly perceived that they had no longer to deal with the sagacious and determined Elizabeth and so took their own course To the great vexation of the bishops they appointed all processes in ecclesiastical courts to be wholly issued in the name of the sovereign and under his seal of arrayThey also annulled all grants of church lands which had been made to the crown for twenty years immediately preceding They legitimated the marriage of clergymen by reviving the act of Edward VI for that effect for under Elizabeth their marriages had been merely tolerated and their children were bastards in lawreckoningIn the convocation Egerton Fleetwood Wotton Clark and other Puritans petitioned for a correction of the  service book  but they and their brethren were commanded to conform before Midsummer or underly the censures of the church In the upper house Rudd bishop of St Asaph insisted at considerable length for some indulgence to  their scrupulous brethren But he was obliged to drop it  In this convocation the  Book of canons  was approved by the clergy and was afterward ratified by his majesty's letters patent It consisted of articles collected from the Injunctions and other episcopal o  synodical acts under Edward VI and Elizabeth it enacted That whoever should affirm the church of England not a true apostolical churchor that her established form of worship was in any respect corrupt or superstitiousor that any of her  Thirtynine articles  could not be subscribed with a safe conscience or that any of her ceremonies were wicked and not to be used when commanded by authorityor her government by archbishops bishops deans  c  was antichristian and contrary to the word of God or that any thing in the  ordinal  for consecration of bishops priests and deacons was contrary to the word of Godor that persons consecrated according to it needed any other call or ordination to their officeAnd that whoever separated from the communion of the church of England or set up any other communion in opposition to itor that affirmed that any such was a lawful churchor affirmed that ministers or laymen might without the king's authority make any rules for church governmentor who submitted to such rulesshould  ipso facto  be excommunicated not to be absolved but by the archbishop after proper evidence of their repentance and a public recantation of their wicked errorsIt further enacted That no appeal from any ecclesiastical judge shall be sustained unless the appellant solemnly promise conformity to the church of England according to the  service book  and subscribe an approbation of it and of the  Thirtynine articles  and the king's supremacy that none be allowed to preach lecture or catechize without such engagementthat people bow at the mention of the name JESUS that all clergymen officiate in the surplice and other sacred robes that all communicants kneel  in receiving the Lord's supper that not parents but godfathers and godmothers present children to baptism and that ministers baptize all children so presented unless their parents were excommunicated  Bancroft being advanced to the archbishoprick of Canterbury and encouraged by the Lawyers decision of the king to be absolute governor of the church persecuted the Puritans with such unrelenting rigour that burning excepted they were much about as miserable as under Mary the bigotted Papist Of above such preachers were quickly deprived for scrupling to subscribe the articles of uniformitysome excommunicated some imprisoned and others driven from their country The king and Starchamber court assisted him in denying them the common privileges of subjects secured by law By a second demand of subscription Bancroft renewed his persecution So many of the London clergy refused to subscribe again that a great part of the churches were in danger of being laid desolate for want of preachershad not the prodigious numbers of scruplers which now appeared alarmed the court and made them for a time to relax their prosecutions Such as insisted for a total separation from the establishment were especially distressed hence the moderate Dr Ames and Parker the author of the  Ecclesiastical policy  and several Brownists retired to Holland where these soon fell by the ears and excommunicated one another This together with the other Puritans debates among themselves relative to the propriety of separation from the church occasioned no small joy to their conformist opposers  Notwithstanding king James' boasting that the Papists might be good subjects while Puritans could not be safely tolerated in any well regulated state they in attempted to blow up him and his whole parliament by the force of gunpowder intending to lay the blame on the Puritans Their enterprize being seasonably discovered and prevented  James in a few days after told his parliament That the Puritans deserved to be burnt for denying the salvation of Papists The parliament enacted That whosoever came not to church should pay twelve pence for every Sabbath they were absent unless they could give a satisfying excuse to the Justices of peace This fell especially on the Puritans as means were used for protecting the Papists The Puritan clergy offered a public disputation concerning the lawfulness of the ceremonies particularly officiating in the surplice crossing in baptism and kneeling at the Lord's supper but it was refused them Hereupon these in Lincolnshire drew up an  Apology  in which they offered to subscribe to his supremacy but could not subscribe their unlimited assent to the  Book of common prayer  and the  Thirtynine articles  as they thought some things in them contrary to the word of God They objected That the  Book of common prayer  or  service book  leaves out a great part of scripture and often the most edifying never to be read in public and prescribes the reading of out of chapters of the Apocrypha in their room thac a bad translation of the Bible is appointed to be read in public service that surplices crossing in baptism and kneeling at the Lord's supper ought not to be used as they have been abused to idolatry by the Papists and have a mystical signification annexed to them and because God alone hath power to appoint ceremonies in his own worship  c  These Objections received an answer from bishop Moreton and Dr BourgesDownham Sparkes Covel Hutton Rogers and Ball wrote in favour of the ceremonies and were answered by Bradshaw Baynes Ames and others  The scruplers being intolerably reproached as  heretics schismatics fanatics precisians enemies to God and their king  Bradshaw published his  English Puritanism  which is a kind of Confession of faith concerning religion in general pastors elders church censures and civil magistracyfor the information  of foreigners by means of Dr Ames now professor of divinity at Francker in Holland Some others published a declaration of their principles concerning  he power of magistrates about sacred matters somewhat of an Independent taste The ministers of Devonshire and Cornwall published a vindication of  hemselves and friends on the head of loyalty to his majesty About three years before James had assur  d the inhabitants of Jersey that he would not make  ny change upon their forms of worship but Ban  roft persuaded him to violate his promise and abo  ish their order of Geneva and force them to an u  iformity with the English church This occasion  d no small trouble to both ministers and people  nd made not a few of them flee into other places  When the parliament met in and a mem  er had very boldly inveighed against the ambition and tyranny of the ecclesiastical rulers and against  he king's arbitrary imposition of taxesJames encouraged by Bancroft and by a royally licensed pu  lication of his vicar general bearing That kings were not bound by laws or oaths or to regard the  onsent of their subjects in raising of taxescalled  oth Houses to Whitehall and told them that it was seditious for them to dispute what kings may do and prohibited them to touch upon any principal  oints of his government Regardless of his high words they asserted their rights petitioned for a  trict execution of the laws against Papistsa prohi  ition of pluralitiesand an indulgence of Puritan  reachers without obliging them to subscribe the  erms of uniformity They also remonstrated against  he High Commission and their tyrannical proce  ureAbout this time died Bancroft and was  ucceeded in the archbishoprick by the pious and moderate and almost half Puritan AbbotIn  the  new  and still authorized  translation of the Bible  was published in consequence of the Puritans  bjections to that of the bishops in the conference  t Hampton court It is a most valuable translation  but a little marked with Episcopalian zeal Hence come  vestry vestments bishops bowing  at the name of Jesus  c  In Legat and Wightman who I suppose had been seduced by the then dispersed Socinian missionaries were burnt for denying the true godhead of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost and a third languished in prison till he died What proper pains were taken to convince them of their errors I know notAbout this time died prince Henry a virtuous youth from whose happy succession to his father deliverance from spiritual oppressions was expected It was even suspected that Jame  caused him to be poisoned on account of the grea  regard paid to him by his subjects But while he  and his agents were labouring to subvert the true Protestant religion and liberty in Britain God laid the foundation of a far distant deliverance in the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth to Frederic Electo  Palatine of the Rhine in whose issue the British royalty hath been long established It is remarkable how heartily the Puritans were attached to and prayed for this alliance and its issue when there appeared no prospect of their being our sovereigns  About A D Henry Jacob having adopted Robinson's plan of mild Brownism and returning from Holland did with solemn fasting found th  first congregational church in England The Independents claim him for their parent rather than th  scandalous BrownNot long after James took  journey to Scotland to introduce his darling cere+monies into the worship of God there As he re+turned through England particularly through Lan+cashire in he was exceedingly grieved to se  the country so deeply infected with Puritanical ob+servation of the Lord's day in consequence of which the holy seasons of Lent and other festivzls were let regarded To check this growing sanctification o  the Sabbath and thereby confute the Popish argu+ments against the Protestant religion he contrar  to his own proclamation in the first year of his reign  and contrary to the  Irish Confession of faith  which  ad just passed under his great seal issued a proclamation bearing That after divine service on the Lord's day his subjects should be allowed their lawful diversions of dancing archery leaping vaulting  laygames Whitsuntideales Morrisdances erec  ion of Maypoles  c  and women be allowed to  dorn the churches with rushes  c  before sermon and pretending to prove the lawfulness of such  portsbut forbidding bullbaiting interludes and such like as unlawfuland prohibiting common people to play at bowls which was reserved for persons of rank at anytime Papists and Puritans were deprived of these diversions because they came not  o their parish churches Had not archbishop Abbot  nd others interceeded he had caused this proclamation to be read from all the pulpits in the kingdom but it was only done in Lancashire where Papists now so much abounded Nothing better could be expected from a king in whose court scarce  ny thing could be heard but oaths and language  ordering on blasphemy  The Dutch Synod of Dort consisting of divines  professors of divinity and ruling elders from the United Provinceswith foreign divines met in As James had been a furious opposer of the Arminians and violently opposed the admission of Vorstius to be professor of divinity at Leyden he was glad to have an opportunity of sending Carleton Davenant Hall Ward and Balcanquel to Dort Dr Goad succeeded Hall whose health could not endure that climate They all assented to every article of the Dutch Confession except that which re  ates to parity of ministers and to church discipline They heartily agreed with the Synod in their decisions against the Arminian doctrines except that Davenant and Ward held some kind of universality of redemption and that some not elected might be saved But Davenant as well as Hall afterward declared that the Arminian tenets could not be adopted  in a consistence with the doctrine of the church of EnglandMeanwhile to the great joy of foreign Protestants English Puritans and archbishop Abbot the Elector Palatine was chosen king of Bohemia But James who hated all elective royalty and was loth to displease the Spanish court from which he expected a wife to Charles his son disliked his soninlaw's advancement and notwithstanding the eagerness of his subjects shifted his assistance till his daughter and her family were reduced to an almost permanent beggary  In the congregation of Robinson a pious and moderate Brownist at Leyden being on the decline thro' the death of old members and marriage of the young into Dutch families they resolved to remove to some part of America under the protection of England where they might preserve their religion They sold their estates and bought two ships and after solemn fasting and prayer for God's blessing and protection set sail for that country One of their ships sailing they all embarked in the other and arrived safe at Cape Cod Nov th Notwithstanding innumerable hardships especially during the first winter they laid the foundation of the New England colony which hath since proved a remarkable refuge for many persecuted fearers of God and in which multitudes have been converted to Christ  Buckeridge Harsnet Neile and Laud having embraced the Arminian errorsby their flattering of James in his notions and practice of arbitrary government made him their hearty friend and were advanced to some of his principal bishopricks Th  Calvinists zeal to preserve the liberties of the natio  made him heartily hate them In consequence here of he reckoned all that opposed his arbitrary ma+nagements to be Puritans who began to be distin+guished into  State Puritans  who contended for a li+mited monarchy and  Church Puritans  who main+tained the doctrines of the Reformation in oppositio  to Arminius When the parliament met in  the Commons drew up a large Remonstrance in which they complained of the danger of the Protestant religion from the increase of Papists their numerous conventicles the remission of the fines imposed on them by law the education of many children of rank in Popish seminaries abroad and the spread of Popish books and they besought his majesty to assist his soninlaw in recovering his Electorate and to break off all attempts toward a marriage of his son Charles with the Spanish Infanta and marry him to some Protestant princess James hearing of this prohibited them to meddle with his government or his son's marriage and because they were not as pliable as he wished he dissolved them  Having thus got rid of his troublesome houses of parliament he commanded the Popish prisoners to be liberated About four thousand Jesuits and others obtained their release Informed of this multitudes of Jesuits and other Papists flocked into England Mass was openly celebrated in the country In London their private meetings were so crowded that in the floor sunk under one of them and killed the preacher and about others Meanwhile the established pulpits were carefully filled with zealots for arbitrary power and such as dared to assert the rights of the subjects were punished Mr Knight having in a sermon before the university of Oxford taught That subordinate magistrates may defend themselves against their sovereign if he become a tyrant and attempt to force their compliance with idolatry or blasphemy Being prosecuted and interrogated What authority he had for such an assertion he quoted Paroeus on Rom xiii but chiefly his majesty in assisting the Protestants of Rochelle against their French sovereign Himself was imprisoned Paroeus' commentaries were publicly burnt at London and Oxford and his assertion condemned as seditious The university of Oxford declared that it was unlawful for subjects upon any account to take arms against their king and all graduates were obliged to  subscribe it and to swear That they would alway continue in that opinionTo distress the Puritans still more effectually James commanded his bishops to prohibit clergymen's touching in their sermons any thing not contained in the  Thirtynine articles  to put down all afternoon sermons and substitute an explication of the  Catechism Creed  and  ten commandments  in their placeand that such as only catechized the children be chiefly countenanced and preferredthat none below a bishop or dean should touch on the deep points of predestination or the universality efficacy or resistableness of God's grace that no preacher should dare to set bounds to the royal prerogative or touch any matter of state that no preacher should rail against Papists or Puritans who were added for a shamthat bishops and archbishops be more cautious in licensing of preachersand that all disobeyers of these injunctions shall be punished with suspension from office and benefice till the archbishops with advice of their convocation prescribe some further punishment Formerly the Puritans had only offended by scrupling Popish ceremonies or forms of government Now their faithful adherence to what they had been required to subscribe in the  Thirtynine articles  contrary to Arminianism rendered them offenders and excluded them from preferment Nay in many places bishops and their officials restricted preachers to the express words of the  Catechism  in their afternoon work  Having to his inexpressible grief accidentally killed a man in hunting archbishop Abbot withdrew himself from the privy council in which his advice had been little regarded on account of his tenderness to pious and conscientious scruplers Having lost their friend many of these Puritans retired to America and Popery came in like a flood To promote the marriage of Charles with the Spanish Infanta it was agreed That she and all her servant children and descendents should have liberty  to profess the Popish religion that she should have a church oratory and chapel furnished with all necessary ornaments and utensils that she should have a bishop and priests to officiate with full jurisdiction that she and her servants should have full liberty to procure dispensations indulgences jubilees  c  from Rome that no English laws against Papists shall in the least affect the Popish descendents of this marriage or stop their succession to the crown that the Infanta shall educate her children in her own religion till they be  ten  years of age To these articles James swore before two Spanish ambassadors and twentyfour privy counsellors who subscribed the treaty He and his son swore also to some private articles That there should be no future execution of the laws against Papists nor any new ones made that there should be a perpetual toleration of the Popish religion in private houses that the Infanta should never be solicited to change her religion that they should deal with the parliament to rescind the laws against PapistsCharles further swore That he would deal with his father to allow the Infanta to have the education of her children till they were  twelve  years of age and that he would diligently hearken to such priests as she would employ to confer with him on points of religion The Papists began to triumph and the Protestants to tremble Archbishop Abbot by a letter earnestly remonstrated against the match After all James solemnly called God to witness that he sincerely detested Popery and that the increase of it was a heavy burden on his soul Meanwhile his parliament presented him with a list of Popish lords and knights in office while scarcely any that was but suspected of Puritanism could be admitted to be a Justice of peace And after finishing the French match for his son he allowed ten thousand Papists to be confirmed at the French ambassador's lodging  In James died not without suspicion of poison He was possessed of some learning deeply  tinctured with pedantry and selfconceit He appears to have been void of all religion or common honesty and remarkable for silly cowardice base dissimulation presumptuous perjury profane swearing lewd speech or behaviour ambition of arbitrary power and rage against Puritans During his reign Papists but especially the Puritans exceedingly increased while the high churchmen by their ignorance error and impiety became the detestation of all sober Protestants Their doctrine became at last high Arminianism While himself if he had any profession was half or wholly a Papist Bent on reconciling the Popish and Protestant faith James' new bishops were almost perfectly similar They maintained the Romish to be a true church and the Pope the principal bishop in Christendom they contended for the lawfulness of images in churches and for the real presence of Christ in the sacrament and that transubstantiation was but a scholastic nicety they pled for auricular confession and priestly absolution and the merit of good works they gave up with the morality of the Christian Sabbath they claimed an uninterrupted succession of the episcopal character from the apostles they were mad on the imitating of Papists in rich furniture of chapels and gawdy pomp of worship While they flamed with zeal in compromising matters with Rome they were notoriously negligent of instructing their people in the truths of God Almost every practical writer of note as Willat Dyke Preston Sibbs Byfield Bolton Hildersham Dod Ball Whatley  c  were Puritans  CHARLES I ascended his throne a hearty enemy to the Puritans looking on them as a kind of seditious and treacherous persons who would take their first opportunity of revolting from the temporal jurisdiction as they had done from the spiritual His queen whom he almost adored was a bigotted French Papist and had the education of her children  secured to her till they should be  thirteen  years of age Her conscience was directed by her Confessor assisted by the Pope's nuncio and a secret cabal of Jesuits and priests Bishop Laud was of a rough temper prone to severities especially against the Paritans impatient of contradiction very arbitrary and superstitious and though not an absolute Papist extremely fond of near approaches to Popery and of being Patriarch of Britain and Ireland The privy council and the Starchamber in which the same persons were members and the High Commission managed almost every thing In some respects the last was worse than the Spanish Inquisition as they punished people without any breach of law Arminianism daily gained ground with all such as coveted preferment Laud had attempted to have it approved by the convocation had not bishop Andrews persuaded him that it was too soon to put it to the trial  Henrietta the Popish queen had scarcely arrived in England when a plague followed her and cut off above forty thousand in London and places about A solemn fast was appointed to supplicate God for the removal of it When the parliament met the Commons earnestly remonstrated against the increase of Popery and the several causes of it and begged that the preaching of God's word might be increased and the labours of pious peaceable and learned scruplers at the ceremonies usedand that pluralities nonresidences and commendams might be moderated Charles promised in the fairest manner But be had already begun to believe that no faith is to be kept with parliaments Upon the very day after he had wrote to archbishop Abbot to proceed against the Papists and had by a proclamation required all English youth to be recalled from the Popish seminaries abroad he appointed eleven Popish priests to be liberated Fiftynine Popish nobility and gentry were in places of power and trust The titular bishop of Chalcedon was appointed the Pope's  vicar general and archdeacons all over England Charles sent eight of his war ships to attack Rochelle The rough sailors and soldiers being more pious than the royal martyr refused to fight for Papists against their Protestant brethren but were betrayed into the hands of French officers  Montague one of his majesty's chaplains published his  Gag for an old goose  which contained several principles calculated to disturb the church or state The House of Commons condemned it and the archbishop prohibited him to write any more on such subjects But encouraged by the court he quickly published his  Appeal to Cesar  the tendency of which was to promote Arminianism and reconciliation with Rome and to advance the king's prerogative above the laws of the land After examination the Commons condemned it as contrary to the doctrine of the church of England and bound Montague in recognizance of two thousand pounds for his appear+ance at their bar when called Apprehending o  pretending this to be an invasion of his majesty'  prerogative and a dangerous precedent Laud and other two bishops through Buckingham persuaded Charles to take the cause into his own hand an  soon after to still the noise about the increase o  Popery and his assisting of his Popish brotherin law against the Protestants of Rochelle he dissolved th  parliament Notwithstanding his extraordinary ca  to prevent the return of any Puritan members b  marking them out for sheriffs the parliamentar  Commons next year fell directly upon Montague errors He was accused of maintaining That th  church of Rome is and alway was a true church which had stood firm on the foundation of the sacra+ments and doctrine instituted by Christ that a  doctrine of faith hope or charity is controverted be+tween Papists and Protestants that images are use+ful for instructing the people and as an excitemen  to devotion that some saints and angels have a p  +culiar patronage over certain persons and countries  that justified persons may fall from graceand of branding Puritans and even exact conformists with odious namesof scoffing at preaching lecturing and all other appearances of serious religionand that the scope of his book was to reconcile the English church to the Roman see Charles again took the cause into his own hand and dissolved the parliament  Nevertheless Montague's Arminian errors were refuted from the press by bishop Carleton doctors Sutliff Featly and Goad and Messrs Ward Burton Yates Wotton Prynne Rouse  c  Several conferences for debating the Arminian errors having happened Charles perhaps instigated by Laud and Neile prohibited all further deputing on these points Laud and his friends having the management in their hands turned the edge of this proclamation wholly against the Puritans They could not have their books printed if they contained any thing against Arminianism or Popery while their opponents were allowed full liberty and had no small encouragement Archbishop Abbot was suspended from his office for refusing to concur in betraying the liberties of church and state into his majesty's hand and for his Christian moderation towards such as scrupled at the ceremonies or even the government of the church And for much the same reason Williams bishop of Lincoln fell under the displeasure of the court But Montague Sibthorp and Manwaring Arminian stretchers of the royal prerogative were caressed and preferred When the parliament met in they again remonstrated against the increase of Popery in England and Ireland in which last Papists had boldly refused to concur in the defence of the kingdom unless they were allowed a legal toleration and to have houses for religious worship in Dublin and other places But so impudent in uttering falshood were Charles and Laud that they pretended all these clamours about Arminianism and Popery to be groundless  conformity to the rules of the church that the matter preached by lecturers be carefully observed that none but noblemen and others qualified in law be allowed to keep chaplains that care be taken to have reading of prayers and catechising as well attended as the sermons Laud caused to transmit a copy of these Instructions to every parson for the due observation of them and by his archdeacons made search for all lecturers and chaplains These lecturers so much suspected were chiefly of the Puritan stamp who scrupling at full conformity only preached in the afternoon having no legal benefice but chosen and maintained by the people Being men of a remarkably holy practice strict observers of the Lord's day warm preachers and staunch Calvinists Laud accounted them the great plagues of church and state When a fast was observed in London for the removal of the raging pestilence prayers were appointed to be read in all the churches but not one sermon was allowed lest the people should have wandered after some of these lecturers The two Rogers Dod Hildersham Ward and many other of the more noted in the diocese of London were suspended For some hints against Arminianism and Popish ceremonies Bernard Chauncey and Smart were prosecuted before the High Commission Bernard till he was ruined with poverty Chauncey till he recanted and Smart lay eleven years in prison till the parliament liberated him Affected with the constant persecution of their party and the reduction of their families to beggary without any prospect of deliverance Messrs Higginson and Skelton with about private persons retired to America and settled in the Massachussettbay as their friends had formerly done at Plymouth After landing they entered into a solemn covenant to walk together in the fear of the Lord and in church fellowship with one another About seventy ministers and four thou+sand planters are said to have retired to that conti+nent from the tyrannical rage of Laud and his agents  The persecutors vented their fury on as many as they could In the learned bishop Davenant though a friend to universal redemption was brought before the council for some Calvinistical hints concerning predestination in his sermon before the king He was dismissed upon his submission but never more favoured at court Mr Leighton a Scotch divine and father to the bishop of that name for some expressions against bishops canons ceremonies and a Popish queen in his  Zion's plea against Prelacy  was condemned to prison for life fined in ten thousand pounds sterling and to be whipt and after that fixed on the pillory at Westminster have one ear cut off and side of his nose slit up and his face branded with  S S  to mark him a  Sower  of  Sedition  and after a few days to be again whipt and pilloried at Cheapside and have the other ear cut off and side of his nose slit When this inhuman sentence was pronounced Laud took off his hat and thanked God for it It was completely executed except that the parliament ten years after released him from prison  The church of  St Catherine Creed  London being lately repaired was suspended from divine service till it should be again consecrated On January th bishop Laud attended by several of the High Commissioners and some civilians went to it As he approached the west door some appointed for that purpose cried with a loud voice  Openye the everlasting doors that the king of glory may enter in  The doors bursting open Laud and his companions entered and falling on his knees with eyes lifted up to heaven and his arms spread to form himself like a crucifix▪ he pronounced the place HOLY in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost Then walking through the middle of the Aile toward the chancel he took up dust several times and threw it into the air Approaching toward the rail of the communion table he bowed himself five or six times towards it Returning thence he and his attendents  went in procession round about the church repeating the hundredth and the nineteenth psalms▪ He then read some short prayers beseeching God to accept of that beautiful building and that a  that should ever be buried in it might rest in peace till Christ's second coming and then rise to eterna  life Returning to the Aile and sitting under a sin  canopy of cloth near the communion table he from a written book read a number of curses against a  such as should profane that holy place by musters o  soldiers or by holding of civil courts in it or b  bearing of burdens through it at the end of each curse bowing toward the East and saying Let al  the people say  Amen  He next pronounced an equa  number of blessings upon all that had any hand i  planning or building it or that should bestow orna+ments or utensils upon it at the end of each bow+ing toward the East and saying Let all the peopl  say  Amen  After a sermon suited to the occasion h  then approached the altar with five or six lowl  bows Coming up to that side of it on which brea  and wine stood covered he bowed himself seve  times After reading a number of prayers he dre  near to the bread and gently lifting the corner o  the napkin which covered it he retired a step o  two and made other three lowly bows towards it Again advancing he uncovered the bread an  bowed himself thrice more toward it After layin  his hand on the covered cup he retired a little an  gave it three humble bows and again approachin  it he stepped back and gave it three more  Q  Di  he believe the elements transubstantiated before the  consecration After blessing of the bread and wine Laud himself received the sacrament and gave it  some principal clergymen who assisted him in the  surplices hoods and tippets A number of mo  prayers being read the consecration was finished The church of St Giles after it had been used fo  three or four years and several others after sti  longer use were suspended from holy service and shut up till they were readmitted by a like consecration When the cathedral churches of London Canterbury Durham and the chapel of Lambeth were repaired the Popish ornaments images of divine persons not excepted were carefully preserved and new ones were procured to render the places more comely and sacred As the Puritans inveighed against these Popish fooleries or wickedness the High Commission took care to punish them for their presumption  In Laud being made chancellor of the university of Oxford expelled several of the fellows for preaching or teaching antiarminian doctrine and appointed others to be sharply admonished For his singular appearances of piety and for preaching twice every Lord's day Mr Crowder was deposed and imprisoned by the High CommissionAbout four years before Drs Gouge Sibbs and other clergymen had formed a scheme to buy up all the ecclesiastical impropriations that were in the hands of laymen and not in the service of the church in order to bestow the profits thereof as salaries upon faithful and diligent preachers Pretending that they chiefly bestowed them upon Puritans Laud got them stripped of all that they had bought and sined to boot For speaking against images in churches Hayden a workman was scourged imprisoned and forced to live on bread and water and two ministers were suspended and excommunicated Sherfield a justice of peace having understood that some ignorant people religiously bowed to seven images of God the Father in the form of a little old man in a blue and red coat working at the creation of the world in the painted glass windows of the old church of Salisbury did with consent of the wardens take out these panes and put new ones in their room For this he was deprived of his recordership sined in pounds sterling and committed to close prison till he paid it Meanwhile Laud inspected the  Press and expunged out of every book for which licence was granted every passage which disallowed of religious pictures or of erecting bowing or praying to images Because the English churches in Holland and Hamburgh refused to conform to his ceremonies he harrassed the foreign Protestants in England He had scarcely returned from assisting his majesty to promote conformity in Scotland when he was made archbishop of Canterbury instead of the now deceased but long ago disgraced and hated Abbot and in Charles' name remitted ARTICLES for the royal chapel at Edinburgh to be a pattern to the rest that kingdom  Great complaints having been presented to Lord Chief Justice Richardson and Baron Denham in their western circuit of manifold mischiefs arising from revels churchales clerkales  N B To save their other time for labour they observed their  wakes  and  feasts of dedication  on the Lord's day In their  Churchales  they drank together and sometimes raised a stock for poor people In their  Clerk ales  they drank at the clerk's house that by the profit of his ale and their compliments they might help his small salary  Bid ales  were drinking matches for setting up people who had lost their substance Their behaviour at these Sabbath meetings was much the same as at our penny weddings drinking matches  c  c  upon the Lord's dayconform to many precedents under Elizabeth and James and even one of they made an order for suppressing them and required every minister to read it on three different Sabbaths every year before Easter and at their return punished some who had been guilty of disobedience Laud having complained of their invading the rights of bishops they were cited before the privy council sharply reprimanded and required to recall their injunctions Pierce bishop of Bath and Wells informed Laud how much the people disliked the suppression of their Sabbath revels and what blessed means they were of bringing people to church and  of promoting mutual affection Seventytwo of his clergy signed this information Meanwhile the justices of the county represented these meetings as a remarkable source of profanation of the Sabbath riotous tippling contempt of authority quarrels murders whoredom and very prejudicial to the peace plenty or order of the country and therefore begged that they might be suppressed No less zealous for supporting and encouraging them Laud caused Charles to republish his father's  Book of sports  adding a particular allowance of the revels above mentioned along with an order to all the bishops to see that it should be read from every pulpit in the several parish churches of the kingdom that all the subjects might know what liberties were allowed them Laud thought the Puritans would refuse to read it from their pulpits on Sabbath and so expose themselves to prosecutions while his fashionable clergy who reckoned the Sabbath of no more than ecclesiastical appointment and no more but the time of public worship holy would readily read it  While the courtiers held their balls masquerades interludes and plays on the Lord's day and the country people especially the youth their revels dances wakes Maygames churchales clerkales bidales and other recreationsmany hundreds of the pious clergy were prosecuted before the High Commission suspended deprived excommunicated and forced to leave the kingdom for refusing to read this  Book of sports  Laud and his party reckoned murder adultery and the like almost no crimes in respect of this To render the  Book of common prayer  more agreeable to the Papists and more distressful to the Puritans Laud at his own hand made some alterations in it In the collect for the royal family Elizabeth of the Palatinate and her distressed family were expunged The prayer against the Papists for the th of November was turned against the Puritans An order was given to turn the communion  tables into altars and to compass them about with rails Bowing at the name of Jesus was peremptorily required Dreadful was the ferment which these alterations occasioned particularly that which related to the communion table Many ministers and church wardens were fined and excommunicated because they scrupled to obey  Prynne a noted lawyer having published a book against stage plays masquerades and dancing it was ordered to be publicly burnt by the hands of the hangman He was deprived of his degrees in Lincoln'sinn and the university of Oxford he was pilloried at Westminster and Cheapside at each of which places he had one of his ears cut off He was fined in five thousand pounds and committed to perpetual imprisonment Dr Bastwick a physician having published a tract against the Romish bishops in which he had denied the divine warrant for the superiority of bishops above presbyters he was deprived of his office excommunicated fined in a thousand pounds and condemned to ly in prison till he should recant Burton a minister was imprisoned for several years because in his published sermons he had dropt some hints against Laud's innovationsWhile the terrible procedure of the High Commission forced Elliot Cotton Davenport Hooker Shepherd and Norton all of them remarkable Puritan ministers to slee into New England Laud having become chancellor of the university of Dublin and having lord deputy Wentworth afterward earl of Strafford on his side he excluded the Puritan articles which archbishop Usher had established in Ireland and introduced the  Thirtynine  English articles in their stead denouncing an excommunication against all such as should affirm any of them to be superfluous or erroneous The Dutch and French Protestants in England consisting of ten congregations and about communicants had their pastors suspended and their churches shut up because they would not agree that their children in the d descent should be bound to  conformity Many of these foreigners left the kingdom to the great hurt of the manufactures and the poor employed in them The English ambassador at Paris was prohibited to attend public worship with the French Protestants but got a chapel of his own furnished to the liking of Laud who declared that he did not look upon the Hugonots as a part of the English's brethren in Christ Provoked with these things few of the foreign Protestants pitied the Eng  ish Episcopalians in their subsequent distress Solicited by his sister Elizabeth Charles granted a Brief for a general collection through England for the Protestant ministers of the Palatinate which had been subdued and terribly distressed by the Popish troops of the emperor But Laud prevented its sucess by excepting that in the Brief Papists were called Antichristians and the religion of the Palatine Protestants said to be the same with that of the church of England  In summer A D Laud performed his metropolitical visitation and had his spies every where that no precentor or even private person was safe to speak in public companies or even converse with his neighbours Terrible were the prosecutions raised for neglecting to change communion tables into  altars  or for other disconformities to his injunctions Many broke up housekeeping intending to go to America Informed of their design the council prohibited all but soldiers mariners merchants and factors to leave the kingdom without a passport from his majesty Notwithstanding this restraint Peter Bulkly and Richard Math  ious clergymen and many others got offTo  vance ecclesiastical power Laud drew much of the business of Westminster hall into the spiritual courts which the king allowed him to hold in name of the bishops Being allowed a right to visit the universities he drew up a system of new statutes for that of Oxford in the preface to which he severely reflected on the disordering government of Edward VI and extolled the  reign of Mary as producing a revival of discipline and making the university to flourishcandour through the much desired felicity of the times sup+plying the place of statutes The other bishops were empowered to form new articles of visitation in their particular dioceses and to administer an oath t  church wardens upon which they should answer  very thing asked of them By these means Powe  Calamy Carter Burroughs Bridges Greenhill an  about fifty other noted Puritan ministers were suspended or otherwise punished to the ruin of their families Afternoon sermons on Sabbath wered espe+cially condemned as they employed Puritan preachers and hindered the revels  Now the leading churchmen had attained their summit grasping not only all ecclesiastical jurisdiction but also the highest preferments of the state Juxo  bishop of London was made High Treasurer th  most lucrative office in the kingdom and which claims precedence next to that of the archbishop The higher they were exalted they became the mor

ca+talogue of God's judgments on Sabbath breakers  an  apo+logy to the English bishops  and a  new litany  being pu+blished in which some sentences were said to be se+ditious schismatic and libellous Prynne Bastwick and Burton prisoners were charged with them i  the Starchamber They prepared their answers bu  could get no lawyer to sign them nor would the cour  receive them from their own hands but condemne  them as confessing what was laid to their charge▪ and because Burton who had got one to sign hi  would not acknowledge it after they had expunged a  but nine or ten lines of it he also was held to hav  confessed Notwithstanding their earnest solicitation to have their answers read Burton was deprived o  his ministry and benefice and along with Bastwic  was pilloried at Westminster and had their ears cut off Prynne had his stumps rooted out and his cheeks marked with  S L  to denote him a  Seditious Libeller  and each of them was fined in pounds and sent to different prisons where they lay without paper pen or ink or access to friends till the par  iament relieved them in Nay such as shewed them any kindness as they were carried to prison were prosecuted Laud laboured to vindicate himself from the charge of attempting innovations in re  igion and thanked the court for their just and honourable sentence and for their zealous defence of  he church Multitudes in the nation particularly ministers lawyers and physicians did not so plea  antly digest this sentence and the execution of it  Much about the same time a process was carried  n against Williams bishop of Lincoln and Osbaldi  on schoolmaster in Westminster Williams had  ad a principal hand in the primary advancement of  aud but he having got himself fixed in the royal  vour removed Williams from all his preferments  court Williams having attached himself to the  berties of church and state and become pretty po  ular happened among some of his clergy to con  emn Laud's innovations and to say that the Puri  ns were his majesty's best subjects and that he had  id he would treat them more mildly Informed  f this Laud got him cited before the Starchamber  r revealing the king's secrets but when that could  ot be got proved he was accused of tampering with  s majesty's evidence and without any proper proof  e High Commission fined him in pounds  d condemned him to arbitrary imprisonment As  s goods were sold to pay his fine and his books  d papers seized by the court they found among  em two or three letters received from Osbaldiston  out five years before and never shown to any per  n in

in pounds more which because he could not pay he was detained in prison till the parliament relieved him Osbaldiston deserted hi  school and concealed himself till the parliamen  met But thinking that they carried matters too far he again quitted his school and espoused hi  majesty's cause  Noblemen still retained Puritan chaplains an  pamphlets were still published against the oppressing managers A proclamation was therefore issued prohibiting all books not licensed by the archbisho  or Juxon of London Multitudes still retiring to Holland or America Charles and his council prohi+bited any to

Charles Chauncey ministers and multitudes of pri  ate persons still flocked to New England Eight  hips were just ready to sail with such fugitives from  ppression in which it is said Cromwel Hampden

with their  rievances  relative to religion Highly provoked  harles dissolved them when they had sat about  ree weeks without passing one actand commit  d their leading members to prison Meanwhile  ud and his convocation had been occupied in fram  g new  Canons  relative to his majesty's suprema  and birthday against Popery Socinianism and  ctaries an oath against attempting innovations in  urch or state a declaration concerning the cere  onies preaching up conformity articles for pa  chial visitations conversation of clergymen chan  llors patents and censures excommunications  commutations of penance jurisdiction licences to marry vexatious citations They also intended to compile a  Pontificial  containing forms of consecrating churches chapels and church yards of reconciling penitentiaries and excluding apostates articles of episcopal visitation and a short prayer before sermon But the sudden dissolution of the parliament prevented the accomplishment of their projects When their  Canons  were published they were generally disliked Multitudes could not admit the absolute power of the king or the unlawfulness of defensive arms against him in  any  case The Puritan  disliked the th th th and th The most o  the clergy disliked the th as it required them speedily to swear an oath with an ETC in the midst o  it after an approved list of Popish church officers▪ and that they would never consent to  any  alteration in the government of the church Many ministers▪ schoolmasters and physicians besought his majesty that this oath might not be imposed Hall bishop of Norwich by a mitigating explication induced hi  clergy to take it But Laud and his party had forced it down the throats of their underlings if Charle  had not restrained them by his letter  Meeting with bad success in his war with the Scots and observing that many of the English either be friended them or at least would not assist him agains  them till they got their own  grievances  redressed h  found himself obliged to call another parliament i  when the condition of his court was truly mi+serable By his ill usage of his parliaments an  taking upon himself the faults of his ministers he ha  much lost the affection of his subjects and had bu  few friends of credit and interest at home Bot  French and Spaniards were pleased with his distress Foreign Protestants abhorred the ruling bishops an  wished well to their oppressed brethren The que  was hated by every body who regarded either re  +gion or liberty The bishops could not but expe  to have their late tyranny resented and their pow  abridged The Judges were contemned and hated for betraying the laws of their country and giving their sanction to almost all the illegal proceedings of the privy council and Starchamber It is nevertheless certain that few members of weight in the parliament had any intention to subvert the Episcopalian government of the church till the haughty behaviour of the bishops and some other circumstances gradually led them to it  Being met the Commons immediately appointed a committee to receive grievances relative to religion They soon attacked the late  Canons  and after warm reasonings found that the clergy have no power to make any binding canons without consent of parliament that the late canons made by the convocation of London and York are not obligatory on any of the subjects that they contain many things inconsistent with his majesty's prerogative laws of the  and rights of parliament and liberties of the sub  ects that their grant of a tax or benevolence is  ontrary to law and not binding upon any of the  lergy It was pled that they had no power to sit  fter the parliament was dissolved and therefore all  heir  Canons  were  ipso facto  null and voidthat  everal of them were bad in themselves and that  he oath which they had framed was in some points  mbiguous and in others directly false and illegal  The convocation met again along with this parlia  ent but having no commission from his majesty  hey transacted no business of importance and after  aud their great supporter was impeached they lost  ll heart dwindled away and broke up without ei+  her prorogation or adjournment After he had or many years oppressed the conscientious part of  he nation Laud was now loaded with manifold  imes The Scotch commissioners accused him of  aking divers alterations in religion contrary to their  anding laws and imposing upon them a book of  mons and a service book contrary to the discipline  ad goovernment of their church and that he had  composed a public prayer for their destruction as traitors and rebels and had caused it to be read in all the churches in England The House of Commons impeached him of attempting to subvert their constitution by an introduction of arbitrary power of procuring sermons to be preached and pamphlets printed in which the authority of parliament is denied and the absolute power of the king asserted of interrupting the course of justice by his messages threatenings and promises to the judgeso  selling justice himself and advising his majesty to sel  places of judicature of procuring the canons and oath imposed by the late convocation of robbing his majesty of his ecclesiastical supremacy and pretending that spiritual jurisdiction is not derived from the crown of introducing Popish ceremonies and cruelly persecuting such as opposed them of promoting men of corrupt principles and practice to the principal stations in the church of retaining chaplains Popishly disposed and committing to them the licensing of books to the scandal of the Protestan  religion of attempting to reconcile the English church to the Romish of discountenancing sermons and silencing depriving imprisoning and banishing godly and orthodox ministers of dividing the church of England from her sister Protestant churches abroad of being the author of all the late disturbances in Scot+land and England of endeavouring to deprive th  kingdom of its legislative power by alienating hi  majesty from his parliament Upon this impeach+ment Laud was imprisoned in the Tower and soo  after suspended from his archbishoprick After h  had lain in prison about four years ten other arti+cles were exhibited against him not much differen  in matter from some of these mentioned Notwith+standing his own and his advocates remarkable quib+bling so much of his indictment was proved as notwithstanding his majesty's pardon brought him to lose his head on Towerhill Jan  Much about the time that Laud was sent to the Tower bishop Williams was discharged and Charles to gain him to his side promised him satisfaction for all the loss he had sustained Prynne Burton and Bastwick and Leighton were liberated and indemnification of their losses out of the estates of Laud and his fellow members of the High Commission and Starchamber voted them But I suppose the subsequent confusions prevented their obtaining much of it A complaint was preferred against bishops Pierce Montague Owen and Manwaring and against several of the inferior clergymen for their zealously promoting Popish innovations and cruelly persecuting such as opposed them but the Commons had not leisure to prosecute them While the parliament manifested their abhorrence of the late measures the people could scarcely be restrained from tumultuously pulling down and destroying whatever they were told had been illegally set up The bishops could scarcely officiate according to their late injunctions or even walk in the streets in their robes without being upbraided as Popish priests  c  Read prayers were decried as a lifeless quenching of the Spirit of God and not suited to the times  The moderate Brownists or Independents had still held their meetings as secretly as possible Lathorp having succeeded Jacob as their pastor one of the members having had a child baptized in the episcopal church this occasioned a dispute in the congregation Whether it ought to be rebaptized The greater part holding the negative such as insisted for a rebaptism separated themselves and chose one Jasse for their pastor who laid the foundation of the first Baptist congregation that I meet with in England The rest of the congregation renewed their covenant to walk together in the ways of the Lord and notwithstanding manifoldhardships continued remarkably stedfast Dispirited by the rent of their congregation Lathorp and about thirty others retired to New England Canne the author of the  marginal references on the Bible succeeded him but after he had preached a year or two in private houses Laud's persecution obliged him to flee to Holland where he was pastor to the Brownists at Amsterdam Samuel Howe supplied his room at London But Laud's party having excommunicated and imprisoned him his church chose Stephen More for their pastor Finding how things went in this parliament they ventured to hold their meetings more publicly The marshal of the king's bench came upon about eighty of them assembled together and threw the most of them into prison Next morning five or six of them were carried before the House of Lords to whom they honestly declared That they could own no other Head of the church than Christ that no laws contrary to these of God ought to be obeyed and they disowned the jurisdiction of the Pope and every other foreigner Such a declaration a few weeks or months before would have cost them their ears but now the Lords dismissed them with a gentle reprimand and three or four of them went to their meeting next Sabbath and were not a little satisfied with their order in preaching and administering the Lord's supper  Though the Commons could not yet rectify the old  canon law  which had long been an unfathomable source of oppression in the spiritual courts they voted down the late innovations and appointed commissioners in all counties to demolish and remove out of churches and chapels all images crucifixes superstitious pictures and other relicks of idolatry according to the injunctions of Edward and Elizabeth They prohibited the imposing of the  oath of uniformity  upon the students of Cambridge and Oxford at their matriculation They made it their business to cut off illegal additions from the worship discipline and government of the church and to punish such as had promoted the introduction of them contrary to the laws of the land  The freedom which the Commons used with the bishops and their canons awakened the attention of the whole nation The Press being now open several pamphlets not in the most decent language were published against these diocesan lords and their office Archbishop Usher applied himself to defend the episcopal order as apostolical but by BISHOP be meant no more than a stated president over presbyterswhich most of the Puritans were willing to admit His half Presbyterian scheme was far enough from pleasing his brethren About a year before bishop Hall directed by Laud had published a  defence of hierarchical Episcopacy  in which he attempted to prove That it was an apostolical institution and of perpetual obligation that as the pious Christian Fathers would not change the form of church government which they had received from the apostles the universal practice of the primitive church is the best rule of judging concerning the apostolical practice and that presbyterian government having no foundation in the word of God or in the practice of the Christian church for years is altogether unjustifiable As Laud in revising it had altered several passages Hall could scarcely go the length of his own book Nevertheless he now published a  Remonstrance  to the parliament and soon after a defence of it in vindication of liturgies and diocesan episcopacy His performances were answered by Messrs Stephen Marshal Edmund Calamy Thomas Young Matthew Newcomb and William Spurstow in their SMECTYMNUS so called from the initial letters of their name in which they shewed That the scripture no where restricts men to set forms of prayer that for years after Christ there were no set forms of prayer imposed by the church and defy the bishop to produce one genuine liturgy within that time They shewed that the English liturgy is extracted from Popish models and in many places offensive to tender Christians that bishops and presbyters are represented as the same in  office in scripture that both scripture and the antient church allowed presbyters to ordain pastors without bishops as archbishop Usher and all the English bishops for many years after the Reformation thought they might and that for years after Christ bishops had no chancellories or commissaries They shewed manifest differences between the bishops of the d and th century and the diocesans in England They concluded beseeching the parliament to reduce Episcopacy to its primitive simplicity if they retained it and that the liturgy might be reformed if they continued it and not at all imposed but left to preachers discretion how much of it should be read where there was sermon Had all the other bishops been as pious and moderate as Hall with all his high flights matters had readily been compromised But the courtiers were too proud to stoop an hair breadth to their opponents and so to the great satisfaction of the Papists the contentions increased till both church and state were in flames  The fate of the hierarchy being now in the hands of the parliament petitions subscribed by multitudes for or against it were presented to both Houses Some as that called the  root and branch Petition  subscribed by citizens and other inhabitants of London craved that the whole fabric of Episcopacy might be demolished Another subscribed by beneficed clergymen only insisted for the reformation of it in which they were joined by great multitudes in othet representations Nineteen petitions signed in whole by about an hundred thousand six thousand of whom were noblemen gentry and dignified clergy insisted for the continuance of the establishment as it had stood since the Reformation These different petitions furnished the Commons with a large field of elaborate debates Sir Henry Vane younger Thomas Bagshaw and White insisted for the total abolishment of the hierarchy Lords Falkland and Digby the most noted of the royalists insisted for the continuance  and reformation of it representing the present bishops and their agents as a set of infernal oppressors who had tried how much of the Papist they could bring in without Popery and how much of the gospel they could destroy without exposing themselves to punishment by the civil law As the Papists who flocked about the court being protected by the queen sometimes insulted the courts of judicature the Commons besought his majesty to issue forth a proclamation for executing the laws against Papists in general and to remove them from his court and all such as refused the oath of supremacy from the army and garrison and to disarm their whole body as their number was become dangerous to the nation there being about of them in one parish of Westminster These addresses did but provoke the Papists the king and queen being determined to protect them as long as they could Charles even reprived Goodman a seminary priest under sentence of death in Newgatewhich occasioned warm remonstrances from both Houses of parliament  In Wentworth now earl of Strafford who had once been a most zealous asserter of the rights of the subjects was attainted of high treason for endeavouring to subvert the government in England and Ireland and to introduce arbitrary power of kings Charles countenanced a plot to draw the army to London and rescue him by force This but enraged the parliament and made his condemnation the more harmonious Even Falkland and Digby who opposed his attainder represented him as a most insupportable tyrant His conduct as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland too strongly verified it With great reluctance Charles signed his sentence of death and perhaps not till himself had hypocritically desired him to do it for the peace of the kingdom A design of Charles' dissolving the parliament taking air the citizens of London declared that they would lend no money upon the parliament's security if their sitting were so precarious Money  being immediately needed to pay off the Scotch and English armies in the North Charles was obliged to ratify an act bearing that the parliament should neither be dissolved nor adjourned without their own consent Alarmed by the discovery of a Popish plot against them and the flight of the conspirators both Houses bishops not excepted entered into a solemn covenant in the presence of Almighty God to maintain with life power and estate as far as they lawfully might the Protestant religion against Papists and Popish innovationsand his majesty's person honour and estate and the privileges of the parliament and rights and liberties ef the nation and of every one concurring in this protestation in every thing they do in prosecution of itand by all proper methods to endeavour to bring to condign punishment all that act contrary to the contents of it and by all just and honourable methods labour to preserve the union and peace between the kingdoms of England Scotland and Irelandand that neither fear hope or any other motive should make them relinquish this vow promise and protestation This was subscribed by eighty lords seventeen bishops nine judges and four hundred and thirtyeight members of the House of Commons and it was immediately printed and sent to all the sheriffs and justices to be taken by the whole nation the minister reading and taking it himself and then those of his congregation the names of such as took or refused it being entered in different registers the Commons soon after voted the refusers of it unfit to bear office either in church or state This protestation except what relates to the hierarchy is materially the same with the  Solemn League  The Commons next attempted to exclude the bishops from their seat in parliament and to abolish  deans chapters archdeacons prebendaries chantors canons  and their officers and to bestow their salaries in supporting preachers for the instruction of the people But both bills were lost in the House o  Lords Meanwhile these peers had appointed ten earls ten bishops and ten barons to examine what innovations needed to be removed These appointed a subcommittee of bishops and divines on both sides Several rectifications were proposed in the doctrine worship and discipline Williams of Lincoln who was chairman or moderator presented a plan for regulating the power and conduct of bishops but which almost nothing diminished their power Archbishop Usher who was then occasionally in England offered another bearing That vicars and church wardens should have much the same power as presbyterial sessions suffragans and their clergy should meet every month in the manner of Presbyteries bishops and their clergy once or twice a year in the manner of Synods archbishops bishops and suffragans together with duly chosen representatives of the inferior clergy once in three years in provincial Synod  and both meet in one national Synod when the parliament should sit This scheme was much the same with the Presbyterian except that the bishops or their suffragans were constant moderators But when it appeared that the bishops stuck together in the parliament against all alterations the committee broke up without agreeing on any plan This stiffness of the bishops provoked their opposers to rise in their demands Meanwhile the High Commission and Starchamber courts being abolished and an act passed against their future erection the Puritans declared their zeal for a Manifesto which Charles s he intended for the meeting of the German princes at Ratisbon in favour of his sister Elizabeth queen of Bohemia and her children bearing That he intended to do his utmost to have them restored to their electorate  Baffled in their former attempts to reduce the power of the bishops the Commons impeached Laud and other twelve of them of high crimes and misdemeanorsfor making and publishing the late  canons  contrary to his majesty's prerogative and the  fundamental laws of the land the rights of parliament and liberties of the subjects They did not resign their seats as was expected but craved time to prepare answers As Charles intended to set off for Scotland to compleat the  Pacification  with that kingdom the  Treaty  between the two nations and  Act of oblivion  excepting the Scotch bishops and four others were ratified and confirmed In this Treaty an endeavouring after an union and uniformity in religion and church government with the Scots was approved by his majesty and his houses of parliament and on the  national Thanksgiving  for the peace the Scots who had a little before been declared  rebels  were by order of parliament declared  good subjects  from all the pulpits in EnglandScarcely had he returned from Scotland when the English bishops severely reproached him for consenting to the abolishment of Prelacy and ratification of Presbytery in that kingdom This together with his consenting to the condemnation of Strafford lay heavy on his heartComplaints of want of sermon in churches being presented to the Commons they appointed afternoon sermons in every church either by the vicar or some other chosen by the parish in his room and that people may at their own charge set up lecturers to preach on Sabbaths or other days where sermon is wanting Forty members were appointed as a committee to provide preachers and salaries for vacant congregations and another committee to examine complaints against scandalous clergymen many of which had been presented They also appointed that the Lord's day should be more carefully sanctified and no sports be allowed on it that all images of divine persons or virgin Mary should be abolished and  bowing  at the name of Jesus or towards the East or the communion table laid aside As archbishop Laud in his prison still presumed to ordain clergymen the Lords suspended him from his office and sequestrated his jurisdiction in the hand of inferior officers till he should clear himself from his charge  Notwithstanding all their zeal for reformation the Commons severely punished such as pretended to promote it in a tumultuous manner or dared to preach without orders  The earl of Antrim and Sir Phelim O'Neal heads of the Popish party in Ireland having acquainted the queen the nuncio and priests about her how easily they could assume the Irish government and assist his majesty against the English Puritans she and Charles by letters authorized them to seize the government They immediately took arms and bound themselves by oath to maintain the catholic religion and bear true and faithful allegiance to the king's majesty and his laws and defend them with their lives and estates against all opponents They called themselves the  Queen's army  and published a declaration bearing That they acted by his majesty's commission under the Great Seal and a letter written by himself Having assembled to the number of twenty or thirty thousand they judged it proper first to massacre all the Protestants in Ireland that they might afterwards with safety march against the English or Scots as his majesty or queen directed Regardless of relation neighbourhood or humanity they massacred about two hundred thousand of them in cold blood and in the most barbarous forms Notwithstanding all the pains taken to conceal and deny it it now plainly appears from the accounts given by Burnet Birch and lately published papers of Clarendon that Charles himself as well as the queen and nuncio were deeply chargeable with this bloodshed though it is probable their agents overdid their orders The news of this massacre struck the English with the utmost consternation and the parliament devised methods for securing themselves and nation against the Papists and for transporting an army to Ireland for the relief of the poor remains of their Protestant brethren Charles insisted for sending over ten thousand forces from England but the Commons dreading an insurrection  of Papists at home insisted for sending the ten thou+sand which the Scots had generously offered No  were their suspicions groundless Charles appeare  extremely unwilling to act against his Popish friend  He had deprived the parliament of their guard h  had turned out the earl of Leicester Lieutenant o  Ireland and Parsons one of the most active Prote+stant Justices in that kingdom He intercepted tw  hundred thousand pounds sent by the English parlia+ment to Ireland He received deputations from th  Irish Papists more respectfully than those from h  Protestant subjects Even during the pacification h  could scarcely forbear calling the Scots  Rebels t  bu  he had almost to be compelled to call the Irish cu  throats  such  After he had done it no more tha  forty  copies of his declaration were allowed to b  printed and not one to be dispersed without furthe  orders  About eight days after his majesty returned fro  Scotland the Commons presented him with  tw  hundred grievances  of the nation They charged th  origination of them on the Jesuited Papists the cou  bishops the corrupt clergy and some corrupt coun+sellors who had engaged themselves in the intere  of foreign powers They represented That the  had been carried on by oppressing the purity an  power of religionby cherishing the Arminians i  the points in which they agreed with the Papists by introducing such innovations in religion as pro+mote a reconcilement with Poperyand by fomen+ing differences between him and his parliament an  encouraging him to illegal and arbitrary methods  raising supplies With respect to religion they com+plained of the censuring of many pious learned an  laborious ministers the oppression of multitudes  faithful subjects by the bishops the almost Spani  inquisitorial severity of the High Commission assiste  by his privy council the rigour of the bisho  courts which had driven many from the kingdom the preferring of those to ecclesiastical honours wh  were most active promoters of superstition or viru  ent railers against piety and honesty the imposition  f Popish innovations in Scotland and England in  rder to effect a reconciliation with the Romish  hurch the favour shown to Papists the late  Ca  ens  and conduct of the bishops in opposition to his supremacy They represented their desire to have a synod of the most pious and learned divines assembled for giving advice how far it is proper to reform the church and informed him of their care to promote  earning and provide for the support of faithful and preaching ministersand of their intention to have  he two universities of Oxford and Cambridge purged of their corruptions  As the Lords appeared to favour the bishops and to shift off their trial the people renewed their supplications to the Commons whom they reckoned the support of religion and liberty The mayor and aldermen of London presented a petition craving that for the promoting of reformation the bishops and Popish lords might be removed from the House of Peers Soon after the apprentices petitioned That the Popish lords and other noted persons of that religion might be taken into custody and Prelacy rooted out The Puritan clergy besought the parliament speedily to rectify that which they found amiss in the church Meanwhile two petitions were presented in favours of Prelacy as the only government of apostolical institution sealed with the blood of martyrs and admirably suited to the civil government of the nation About the time the apprentices presented their petition some began to insult the bishops as they went to or returned from the Parliamenthouse They remonstrated to Charles and the Lords That on account of danger to their persons they absented and protested That nothing enacted by the parliament during their involuntary absence should be  valid  in law The Lords immediately communicated their protest to the Commons who upon the footing of it impeached the twelve bishops who had  signed it of High treason in endeavouring to sub+vert the fundamental laws of the land and the ver  being of parliaments The same evening they wer  sequestred and ten of them sent to the Tower Ha  of Norwich and his brother of Durham on accoun  of their former useful labours were but committe  to the custody of the Black Rod Thus William  now archbishop of York and his brethren by an ac  of almost pure madness entangled themselves In+stead of prosecuting their impeachment the parlia+ment voted them entirely out of the House and too  all temporal jurisdiction from persons in holy orders▪ and Charles in hopes that it would satisfy the peo+ple and prevent all further demands reluctantly ra+tified their deed As the bishops were generally hat+ed especially at London the passing of this bill wa  attended with bonefires and illumination of window  Being resolved to pass no more particular acts rela+tive to religion Charles retired from London an  his queen to Hollanda plain signal of his intentio  to break with his parliament After he and they ha  some altercation the Scots to his great offence an  their satisfaction offered to mediate between them▪ Once and again he rejected their offers and applie  to the Papists and the not much better Collegian  of Oxford and Cambridge But the parliament pro+fessed their readiness to accept the Scots mediation  and endeavoured to cultivate a good correspondenc  with them The Scotch General Assembly by  letter solicited the English parliament to promot  uniformity with them in church government an  worship and to extirpate Prelacy as without tha  they could not hope to have  one Confession of Faith Catechism  or  Form of worship  The parliament re+turned a kind reply desiring that the Scots woul  join them in beseeching his majesty to call an Assem+bly of divines and would send some of their own t  it for promoting the much desired uniformity T  encourage them to these things they with amazin  harmony abolished that form of Episcopacy which was established by the English laws But as this act only appointed it to cease about a year after and provided nothing in its place it is probable that some of the English managers hoped before that time to obtain peace with his majesty and so retain Episcopacy with some modifications And indeed the whole pertinents of Prelacy were never abolished till after he was reduced  About this time an uncommon seriousness and devotion prevailed among those that lived in places to which the power of the parliament chiefly extended The Sabbath was sanctified with unusual strictness the churches were crowded with attentive hearers three or four times a day the officers of the peace walked in the streets and shut up all public houses nor did any travel on roads or walk in fields but in case of absolute necessity Religious exercises were so universally set up in private families that at certain hours one might have traversed the streets of London without seeing one idle person or hearing any thing but the sound of prayers and praises from churches and houses The parliament prohibited stage plays as too often expressive of levity and wantonnessand other diversions as not suited to their afflicted circumstances They commanded the monthly fasts which had been appointed about a year before with his majesty's consent for bewailing the deplorable ciroumstances of Ireland to be exactly observed Morning exercises were set up in churches to pray for persons in the army or otherwise in danger and to administer proper exhortations Morning lectures were set up for the benefit of members of parliament The laws against vice were so strictly executed that no stews or gaming houses were to be found nor was profane swearing or like debauchery to be seen or heard in the streets The like appearances of religion prevailed in the parliament's army the most of their soldiers not so much fighting for pay as for religion and liberty and they  had the most noted preachers for chaplains to their regiments Meanwhile most of his majesty's partizans and warriors were remarkably profligate ready to take every sober person for a Puritan and to plunder him on that accountby means of which not a few were induced or forced into the parliament's side Many of his preachers knew little more of their business than to rail at the Puritans and their doctrines of God's free grace  In after a solemn fast in which they and the nation bewailed their own and father's iniquities the parliament warmly requested his majesty That the laws should be strictly executed against the Papists and that they should be obliged to abjure the Pope's supremacy transubstantiation purgatory and worship of imagesand their children trained up in the Protestant religion and that he would give his assent to the five acts which they had madefor suppressing innovations in God's worship for strict observation of the Lord's dayfor the abolishment of Prelacyfor the punishment of scandalous clergymenfor the restraint of pluralities of church livings with charge of souls and nonresidences of clergymen at their chargesand for calling an assembly of learned divines to advise them in settling the government and liturgy of the church But he was far enough from any honest compliance with such demands  The clergy of both sides had peculiar hardships to endure from both sides Charles' partizans had hanged up some of the Puritan clergy if the parliament had not threatened to make reprisals The committee which the parliament appointed to purge out scandalous clergymen was obliged to subdivide  itself on account of the vast extent of their work Shocking discoveries were made in the lives of not a few of the conforming clergy Many insulted the committees and their witnesses and threatened reprisals Notwithstanding the ejection of multitudes for their scandals not a few scarcely tolerable in  their practice were allowed to retain their charges The parliament supplied the place of the ejected the best way they could Two congregations were sometimes committed to one pastor and some that were too weak were admitted to others Meanwhile they seized the bishops lands to assist them in carrying on their war with his majesty allowing considerable pensions to such of them as had been more decent and less wicked They proceeded in appointing organs and monuments of superstition and idolatry to be removed from places of public worship Besides their monthly fasts on Wednesdays which Charles and his friends observed on holy Fridays they appointed several occasional fasts on account of their distressful circumstances The war between the different parties being carried on from the Press with almost as much fury as in the field the parliament prohibited the printing of any book which was not licensed by such as they appointed for that work different licensers being allotted to the different sciences to which books pertained  Despairing of Charles' concurrence with them in calling an Assembly of divines the parliament by themselves called one not to be an independent judicatory of Jesus Christ but a committee for advising them in religious matters proper to be considered and established by civil authority Having had lists of the best qualified persons in the several counties transmitted to them by knights and burgesses they selected an hundred and twentyone divines to which they added ten Lords and twenty Commoners with equal power of debating and voting When any of these died the parliament chose his successor Mest Alexander Henderson George Gillespy Samuel Rutherfoord and Robert Bailie ministers lord Maitland the earl of Lowdon and Archibald Johnston afterward lord Warriston ruling elders commissioners from the Scotch General Assembly were not without some reluctance admitted as members No more than about ninetysix of the English divines  gave any proper attendance Archbishop Usher bishop Brownrig Henry Hammond John Hacket George Morley Robert Sanderson and William Nicolson the four last of whom after the restoration were bishops of Litchfield Winchester Lincoln and Gloucester never took their seats Though the parliament had appointed Episcopalians as well as Presbyterians and Independents members few of the first kind ever took their seats and those that did quickly withdrew when Charles prohibited their meeting because the members had not been chosen by the clergy and many of them were either laymen or Puritans They that continued in it were generally men of eminent piety learning and faithfulness to God and their country Their meeting was opened July with a sermon by Dr Twisse their prolocutor or moderator They agreed upon a solemn vow to be taken by every member at his admission  That he should maintain no doctrine but what he believed most agreeable to the word of God and nothing in points of discipline but what he believed to be conducive to the glory of God and the peace and welfare of his church  This their solemn vow or oath was read to them every Monday morning to render it deep and fresh in their minds After fixing the order of their procedure they petitioned the parliament to appoint a  solemn fast  for divine direction in their important business and that they would take still more effectual methods for rooting out the ignorance profanation of the Sabbath profane swearing cursing drunkenness and uncleanness still found in the land that they would speedily purge out ignorant and scandalous clergymen and substitute proper ministers in their steadthat they would exert themselves for the relief of those ministers whom his majesty's party retained in distressful imprisonment at Oxford A committee of the Assembly was appointed to revise the  Thirtynine articles  and render them more plain and pointed particularly in opposition to Arminianism But after a review of  fifteen  rticles  this was dropt and it was resolved to draw up a more full  Confession of Faith  To mark their  eal against Antinomianism they condemned some notions of Crisp Eaton and Saltmarsh and laboured sometimes  not very circumspectly  to confute them  n their sermons and writings  The parliament's affairs being reduced to a low ebb they deputied the earl of Rutland Sir Henry Vane and Messrs Stephen Marshal and Philip Nye and three others to negotiate with the Scotch Convention of Estates and General Assembly for some assistance in this critical hour The Assembly considering That the English had befriended them in their distress and that the Protestant religion in Britain was in danger and that by this means their own religion might be the better secured and an uniformity with their English brethren promoted earnestly advised to grant their request on proper terms A draught of a  solemn league  with one another and  covenant  with God approved by the Scotch Assembly and Convention of Estates being brought up to London the parliament referred it to the Assembly of divines where it met with no small opposition Gataker and others refused to subscribe it till they got that which related to Prelacy so circumscribed as in their view not to exclude archbishop Usher's scheme of primitive Episcopacy The Scotch divines insisted to have Prelacy abjured as sinful But most of the English opposed this the Independents Erastians and half Episcopalians thought that the words  according to the word of God  sufficiently protected them against the inroads of Scotch Presbytery and the Scots thought the following words  according to the practice of the best reformed churches  necessarily meant their own government and discipline When Coleman the noted Erastian read it to the Lords in order to their swearing and subscribing it he openly declared that by abjuring  Prelacy  they did not abjure all kinds of Episcopacy but only that kind particularly described in this oath  After this covenant had been sworn by both Houses of parliament the Assembly of divines and the inhabitants of London the parliament appointed it to be taken by the rest of the nation above eighteen years of age and transmitted along with it an exhortation by the Assembly to take itand directions regulating the manner of doing it Great numbers took it chearfully and with a good conscience Others did so because the parliament and their circumstances required it When it was imposed upon the English in Holland the Elector Palatine of the Rhine and who afterward sat for a time with the Westminster Assembly took it Not long afterward the parliament enacted That none should be counsellors in burghs or have the power of electing one unless they took it Ministers were required to take it at their ordination None were to be continued in trust civil or military who obstinately refused it These mandates of the parliament were not very punctually executed Richard Baxter and some other Puritan ministers much prevented the imposition of this covenant in the corners where they resided At Oxford and many other places it was little urged unless upon such as were suspected or rather well known to favour the king's party and not so properly as a religious vow as an oath of obedience to the parliament After the war it was imposed on the royalists with much the same intent  The committee for purging out scandalous ministers sometimes made use of the covenant for discovering malignant clergymenwhich occasioned a report That they were turned out for refusing it But their immoralities and disaffection to the parlia+ment were ordinarily if not alway the true cause  of their sequestration Nay I do not know of on  single person punished for his simple refusal of thi  covenant Charles by a proclamation declared i  traiterous  and  seditious  and prohibited all his subjects to give or take it About the same time h  agreed to a cessation of arms with the Irish Papists  hose hands were so deeply dipt in murder But  he Scotch troops refused to adhere to it and for  everal years stood their ground against these bloody  utthroats the best way they could He then cal  ed over not only part of the duke of Osmond's army but also some thousands of these Popish murde  ers to assist him against his parliament Fifteen  undred of them perished at sea Such of them as came and served under himself or under Montrose his agent in Scotland brought their savage disposition along with them killing people in cold blood spoiling the country and burning what they could not carry off This alienated the earls of Holland Bedford Clare and CarlisleSir Henry Deering and others of his best friends from him as they saw him regardless of the welfare of his kingdom The parliament ordered the Assembly to inform the soreign Protestants of his artifices and of the tokens of his disregard of the Protestant religion notwithstanding his solemn declarations of attachment to it Charles pursued their representation at the heels with a contrary declaration But his manifest obstinacy  n supporting the Hierarchy and dissimulation even  n receiving the sacrament from archbishop Usher made it little regarded About this time died Chil  ingworth who after revolting to the Jesuits returned to the Protestants and seemed to be an Arian or Socinianand also the two famous commoners Hampden and Pym  In Charles held a small parliament at Oxford while the majority of the Peers and three hundred and eighty of the Commons adhered to the parliament But their proposals were too pacific to please him Meanwhile twentyone thousand Scots having entered England for their assistance the parliament at Westminster took heart and resolved to proceed in their intended reformation and to establish a new Form of discipline and government The earl of Manchester with two ministers were appointed to purge the university of Cambridge which  though under the power of the parliament had hi+therto proved a sanctuary for their enemies Manchester proceeded with great mildness And though he tendered the covenant to many yet such as behaved peaceably were allowed to keep their places notwithstanding they declined taking it About a  hundred and fifty of the Fellows kept their places Most of the other two hundred had before gone of to the royal army which was now commanded by Rupert prince Palatine's brother and almost wholl  composed of furious banditti J Cosins Tho Pa  k  B Laney S Collins E Martin R Stern W Beale  T Comber R Holdsworth S Ward R Brownrigg who had zealously taught their students Tha  it was unlawful on any account to resist the king were turned out and L Seaman R Chudworth R▪ Vines B Whichcot H Palmer T Young J▪ Arrowsmith T Hill R Minshul W Spurstow  and afterward J Lightfoot were put in their place  The vacant fellowships were filled up with men learned and pious as fast as they could The Assembly examined the candidates before their admission I  consequence of this change not only learning bu  sanctification of the Sabbath and other branches o  piety prevailed in the collegesThe purgation o  the scandalous clergy still continued Near tw  thousand were turned out of whom wer  proved guilty of scandal by the oath of habile witnessesUnless they retired to his majesty's quarters the parliament allowed them a  fifth part  of their salary for the support of their wives and children an  these that laboured in their stead were allowed th  other  four parts  These were admitted by the choic  of the congregations and examination by a committee of the Assembly consisting of twentytwo members  Finding his forces unable to resist the united strength of the parliament and their Scotch allies Charles professed himself ready to hearken to term  of accommodation A treaty was for a time prosecuted at Uxbridge in which there was perhaps too little sincerity on either side and each suspected the other Charles professed chiefly to scruple at allowing or establishing of any other form of worship or government than had been long used To enlighten his conscience Messrs A Henderson of Edinburgh S Marshal and R Vines held a solemn conference before him with Dr Stewart and others of his party concerning Episcopacy and its attendent ceremonies Neither party appeared convinced by their opponents But Charles perhaps without any intention of performance promised that he would admit of the reduction of Prelacy almost to archbishop Usher's plan Before the Scots came to assist them the parliament would have been glad of his offer but now they would accept of nothing less than the compleat abolishment of Prelacy  Meanwhile the work of the Assembly proceeded but slowly on account of the different parties in it each of which had their supporters in parliament The Presbyterians were the most numerous having the Scotch divines and London ministers for their principals and Denzil Hollis W Waller Philip Stapleton J Clotworthy B RudyardMaynard Massey Harley Glyn and some others for their chief supporters in the House of Commons Selden Whitlock Lightfoot Coleman and some others like the English reformers and other Erastians believed the government and discipline of the church to depend on the will of the magistrateand had St John Widdrington Crew Hipsley and others to support them in parliament Thom Goodwin Ph Nye Syd Simson Jer Burroughs and W Bridge supported the cause of Independency allowing the magistrate little power about ecclesiastical affairs placing the government of the church in the community of the faithful and denying the authority and subordination of sessions presbyteries or synods of church officers No Anabaptists were members  of the Assembly but their number mightily increased without doors They sent one Blunt to Holland for rebaptism to himself Having obtained it he returned and rebaptized Blacklock their teacher who rebaptized all the rest Tombes and Cornwal learned divines joining them added to their credit Not long after they published their  Confession of faith  consisting of fiftytwo articles Numbers of them appear to have been serious Christians but they were exceedingly given to rail at ministers having stated salaries for their support and not working with their hands They had no sooner become very numerous than they split into two parties of  general  and  particular  or Arminian and Calvinist Baptists  As the bishops refused to ordain the candidates that were not in the king's interest the Assembly considered how such might be ordained before they had finished their Directory Notwithstanding the warm opposition of the Independent brethren it was carried That a number of ministers in the present circumstances might ordain ministers till church judicatories could be got established Ten of the members with thirteen others seven of whom were a  quorum  were appointed by the parliament for that purpose A similar committee of twentyone was appointed to ordain for the county of Lancashire The  Directory for worship  being with much unanimity agreed upon by the Assembly the parliament soon after appointed the observation of it in the kingdom instead of the  Book of common prayer  under the penalties mentioned in the act and all that preached wrote or printed any thing against it were subjected to a fine between five and fifty pounds sterling In opposition to this Charles by a proclamation prohibited the use of the Directory and requiring the observation of the Book of common prayer under pain of being held disaffected to both church and state  When the Assembly proceeded to form stated Rules for ordination of ministers they had hot contention with the Erastians on the one hand and Independents on the other For ten days the Independents contended for the right of every congregation to ordain their own pastors When it carried That no single congregation which could unite with others ought to assume the right of ordination Goodwin Nye Simson Burroughs Bridges Carter and Greenhill entered their dissentThey no less warmly disputed That no minister ought to be ordained without fixing him to a particular charge But this was got compromised and the proposition made to run That it is  agreeable to the word of God and very expedient  that those who are to be ordained ministers should be designed to some particular charge The Independents consented to  imposition of hands  in ordination providing it should be attended with a declaration that it was not intended as the conveyance of office powerThe  Directory for ordination  being finished the parliament established it for the space of a year to try how it would answer After that they established it for three years longer  When the Assembly entered upon the government of the church both Presbyterians and Independents heartily agreed against the Erastians That  Jesus Christ had fixed a particular form of government  in his New Testament church But when they proceeded to enquire What that particular form of church government was and Whether it was perpetually binding the Presbyterians had hard struggling with the Independents on the one hand and the Erastians on the other The Erastians were content to allow Presbyterian government to be  most agreeable to the word of God  and most proper to be settled in England but they warmly opposed the  divine right  of it For fifteen days the Independents combatted the divine appointment of Presbytery and for as many more contended for the divine right of their own form of church government Here the primitive  order of the Christian church the scripture warrant for ruling elders the subordination and power of church courts were largely disputed and Selden and Lightfoot helped the Independents in times of need The Presbyterians having carried their point the Independents entered their dissent and complained that they had been ill used and some of their papers refused a hearing The Erastians reserved their principal effort for the House of Commons in which they were sure to be joined by all the Independents against the  divine right  of Presbytery Informed of their design the Presbyterians studied to have their whole strength in the House very early that they might get their point carried before their opponents came fully up Perceiving their intent Glyn and Whitlock spake at great length upon  divine right  till the House was quite full and then it was carried not That Presbytery is  founded on  the word of Godbut as it still stands That it is  lawful  and  agreeable  to the word of God That the church be governed by congregational classical and synodical Assemblies Pierced with grief that the Erastians had carried this point against them the Scotch commissioners and other Presbyterians instigated the council and afterward the ministers of London to beseech the Commons to establish Presbyterian government as the government of Jesus Christ This drew the frowns of the House upon the supplicants The Presbyterian ministers next applied to the Lords and soon after with the mayor and aldermen of London at their head gave in a second petition to them These applications occasioned a misunderstanding between the city and parliament which at last issued in the ruin of the Presbyterians cause  The Assembly's lodging of the power to rebuke suspend from sacraments excommunicate the scandalous and to absolve the penitent in the hand of the Presbytery or eldership as theirs by  divine right  occasioned a warm debate between them and the parliament While the Independents claimed this  power for the Christian brotherhood in every congregation and pled that no civil sanction or penalty should attend itSelden Whitlock and other Erastians contended That church communion ought to be left quite open and crimes be cognizable and punishable only by the magistrate But as pastors want of power to restrain scandalous persons from the Lord's table had been one of the late popular complaints the parliament did not think it proper to reject excommunication altogether but to render it a mere cypher they required the Assembly to fix What degrees of knowledge were necessary to admission to the Lord's table and What sorts of scandal deserved suspension or excommunication After no small litigation among themselves the Assembly represented That such as did not know and believe the being of a God the Trinity of persons in the Godhead the doctrine of original sin of Christ's being Godman and our only Mediator and that he and his benefits are applied by faith which is the gift of God the nature and importance of the sacraments the immediate entrance of departed souls into heaven or hell the resurrection of the body and the future judgment of menshould be excluded for their ignorance or errorAnd that all incestuous persons adulterers fornicators drunkards profane swearers and cursers murderers worshippers of images or relicks saints or angels all that make images of divine persons or that are at variance with their neighbours all duellers or carriers of messages between them profaners of the Sabbath by sports or civil labour keepers of stews pimpssuch as marry their children with Papists consulters of witches or fortune tellers assaulters of parents or of magistrates or their officers in the legal execution of their office and persons regularly attainted of barratry forgery extortion or briberyshould be secluded as scandalous The parliament allowed this representation and engrossed it into their act but by securing an appeal  from the highest church courts to the parliamen  they to the great grief of the Scotch commissioner  and many others effectually kept the power in thei  own hands They also appointed That churc  courts should take no cognizance of civil rights an  that no confession or proof before the eldership b  made use of before civil courts  Not long after the parliament suspecting that th  Presbyterians intended to render the church altoge+ther independent on the stateenacted That ther  should be liberty of appeal from every classical pre  +bytery to the civil commissioners of the county They next appointed rules for the election of rulin  elders and for division of the kingdom into classica  Presbyteries and provincial Synods They appoint+ed two elders for each minister to attend Presbyteries two ministers and from four to nine elders from each Presbytery to attend provincial Synods an  two ministers and four elders from each Synod t  attend the National Assembly Thus the power o  government was chiefly lodged in the hand of th  ruling eldersIn this form was Presbyterian go+vernment settled in for the space of a year ti  it might be discerned what further alterations wer  necessary It pleased no party concerned The E+piscopalians and Independents were offended tha  they were shut out without so much as a toleration Such as reckoned Presbyterian government  founde  on the word of God were offended that the powe  was so much reserved for the civil magistrate espe+cially in the exclusion of persons from the Lotd's ta+bleWhen this scheme was laid before the Scotc  parliament and General Assembly they insisted fo  sundry amendments That no godly minister shoul  be excluded from sitting as a member of Presbyte+ries Synods or Assemblies that the ordinary tim  for the meeting of the National Assembly should b  fixed allowing a power for both church and  state  t  conveen it upon any necessary occasion that congre+gational elderships be allowed to determine concern+  ng  scandals not expressed that the act for the or  ination of ministers be made perpetual that the ar  icles respecting the subjection of church judicatories  o the parliamentthe exemption of persons of high  ank from church censures and obliging of church  ulers to admit persons to the Lord's table contrary  o their conscience be altered to general satisfaction  nd that the article respecting perpetual offices and  fficers in the church the order and power of church  ourts and the directions for public penance and ex  ommunication be fixed The English parliament  eplied with some warmth That they had done what  hey could and therefore thought it strange to find  hemselves suspected of unwillingness to establish  resbyterian government because they did not in  manner inconsistent with the laws of their land  stablish near ten thousand unlimited and arbitrary  ourts of parochial sessions in the kingdom The  resbyterian ministers in England seconded the Re  resentations from Scotland and refused to accept  f the parliament's establishment of the church till  hey should part with the key of discipline and go  ernment Highly offended with their address the Commons threatened them with a  Premunire  for  resuming to dispute with their superiors who had  alled their Assembly merely for advice not to allow  hem to be judges upon any pointTo embarrass  not divide the Assembly and at least to gain time  ll they should see the issue of the Treaty with his  ajesty who had thrown himself into the Scotch  rmy they delivered to them a sett of captious ques  ons relative to the divine right of church government and its several circumstances and required  hat the scriptures proving or disproving each par  cular should be set down at large and every mem  er sign his opinion on each point After solemn  sting and prayer for God's special direction when  en had laid such an entangling snare for their feet  e Assembly applied themselves to their task  Before this establishment of Presbyterian government the Independents had hoped for one to comprehend them But finding themselves disappointed they would no more listen to any proposals o  comprehension with the Presbyterians but pled fo  such an authoritative toleration as should allow them to set up by themselves and gather churches of al  such as in the Presbyterian parishes chose to join with them And this they required not only fo  themselves but for the sober Anabaptists and al  such others as held the fundamental principles of th  Christian religion though they did not seem capable to point out these principles in a precise manner The Presbyterians who already found what multitudes of sectaries had started up during the few preceding years broken state of the church and wha  trouble the Assembly had got with a few of them represented to them the danger schism and confusion that would be occasioned by this toleration which they requestedand offered to allow them t  abstain from communion with them in the Lord'  supper without being censurable The Independent replied That they did not intend any total separati+on from the church while they held the most o  these things which the Presbyterians did in worshiping according to the  Directory  in retaining the sam  church officers and requiring the same qualifications in order to admission to the sacraments and using the very same censures that they would hold occasional communion with them in the Lord's supper and in like manner admit Presbyterians with them that their ministers should sometimes preac  for one another and they would call Presbyteria  ministers to attend as companions at their ordinations that they will consent to have their congregations restricted to a certain number which may b  receptacles for tender consciences The Presbyterians insisted on the obvious mischiefs of tolerations and that if their Independent brethren could hold occasional communion with them in sealing ordinan+  es  it would be schismatical in them to separate As the Presbyterians insisted for close conjunction  nd uniformity and the Independents rather extended their terms of toleration the committee of Lords  nd Commons and Assembly of divines broke up without effecting any accommodation between them Meanwhile the Scotch parliament transmitted to the English one a declaration against the toleration of  ectaries Many pamphlets were published and sermons preached particularly before the parliament  n this point In a letter to the Assembly the London ministers beseech them to oppose such a lawless  oleration as would strangle their church establishment in its very birth A smart answer to it openly  led for the toleration of ALL opinions and that  o man is answerable to civil magistrates for his opinions any farther than they interfere with the state  t is certain the Presbyterians' opposition to the to  eration lost them the favour of many especially of  he army But when one considers the spawn of  errors and blasphemies and the almost unnumbered  orms of sectaries which then appeared in England  he will the less wonder at their dislike of the desired  oleration During these contentions Charles offered T Goodwin and P Nye large terms of liberty if  hey would oppose the Presbyterian government  ut they informed their Presbyterian brethren and  o Charles dropt all correspondence with them  The parliament's ordinance for introduction of Presbyterial classes never took effect but in London  nd Lancashire In other places the ministers had  oluntary associations but without legal jurisdiction While both Scotch and English Presbyterians insisted That the parliament would compleat their settlement of the desired uniformity engaged to in the so  emn league and declare such as were disaffected to church and state incapable of places of power and  rust the parliament gave them fair words and pre  ended that the delay of the Assembly's answers to  heir late questions hindered it and nothing else  Meanwhile the Independents and the sectarians in the army boldly pled for a toleration and got a number of the citizens of London to supplicate the parliament in their favours It is probable that the royalists in order to ruin the parliament helped forward these divisions After the Erastians had not a little harrassed the Assembly on the divine right of the several pertinents of Presbyterian government Coleman died and all the rest except Lightfoot slipt off and left the Presbyterians and some few Independents to manage matters as they pleased At last the Assembly finished their answers to the parliament's questions but for fear of a  Premunire  they never presented them The London divines therefore took up the controversy and published their learned view of the  divine right of church government  The parliament still continued to treat with his majesty But his concluding a peace with the Irish Papists who had but lately massacred some hundred thousands of his Protestant subjects and his passing an  act of oblivion  of all that they had done in the course of their rebellionand his flight into the Scotch army made them to suspect him and as he fell in his demands they rose in theirs and both seemed rather intent on outwitting than on amicably treating with one anotherWhen he fled from Oxford as it was on the point of being blocked up by Fairfax the parliament's general he with two or three attendants came within ten miles of London Finding it unsafe to enter the city he first directed his course toward the sea as if he had intended to leave this country and then turning northward he to their astonishment threw himself into the Scotc  army at Newcastle without previously acquainting them On his first arrival he seemed disposed to+ward peace with his parliament and on May th wrote them to that effect and assured them that he had recalled all commissions granted by hi  for making war on his subjects and had ordered th  disbanding of all his forces and that he cordially intended to join with his parliament in establishing religion according to the advice of his English and Scotch Parliaments But some Episcopalian bigots getting access to him he changed his mind The Scotch army and their Committee of Estates at Edinburgh beseeching him to satisfy his English parliament concerning religion as without his doing it they could not according to their conscience or covenant protect him against them and indeed they could not have attempted to do it without ruining their own countryCharles professed his willingness to confer with any whom they should appoint concerning the lawfulness of abolishing Prelacy and establishing Presbytery contrary to his coronation oath Mr A Henderson was brought from Edinburgh for that purpose But Charles had been so  iutoxicated with the divine right of Prelacy the superlative excellence of the  Book of common prayer  the uninterrupted succession of bishops from the apostles the right of the antient Christian doctors to be judges in controversies and the standard of interpreting scripture princes sole right to reform any thing in religion and the unlawfulness of subjects on any account taking arms against their king that Mr Henderson's nervous reasoning had no effect upon him His pretences of regard to his coronation oath after he had spent the first fifteen years of his reign in a perpetual violation of it marked him determined to receive no conviction  While the parliament having by new acts rooted up the foundations of Prelacy declared it for ever abolished appointed the bishops lands and privileges to be sold for defraying the expences of the war and supporting preaching clergymenthey insisted with Charles as the condition of peace that he would ratify their deeds for the reformation of religion Notwithstanding the most importunate intreaties of his trusty and sensible friends he still refused and insisted that at least bishops should be retained in  his quarters the dioceses of Oxford Winchester Bath Wells and Exeter He insisted with the Scotch army to protect him But as neither their church nor state would hear of his coming to Scotland on his own terms and they could not retain him in England without an immediate war with the parliament's forces they surrendered him up to the English parliament without either asking or receiving a single farthing on that account  In the English Lords and many others intended whenever the Scots marched home to dispatch a considerable body of their own troops to act against the Papists and their royal confederates in Ireland and to retain at home no more than were necessary for the peace of the country and to have these commanded by persons well affected to their covenanted reformation by which means they hoped to treat with more advantage with his majesty The Scotch army who on this consideration hastened their departure were scarcely at home when the English parliament made an ordinance for the suppression of heresy and schism and appointed a solemn fast for bewailing their increase They enacted That no member of the house nor any who did not take the covenant should command in the army or in garrisons nor any drunkard swearer or otherwise scandalous person and that ten thousand and six hundred foot forces should be sent to Ireland and horse and the soldiers in garrisons be retained at home and all the rest disbanded on the d of June ensuing In consequence of these things Charles sent them more satisfactory answers to their propositions  Notwithstanding the above acts of parliament the sectaries more and more increased In the army there were still many sober and serious but things were hastening into a chaos of confusion in religion The officers became fiery disputants and often supplied the place of ministers to the regiments and officiated in the pulpits where they were quartered▪  Thomas Edwards a zealous Presbyterian in his  Gangrene of heresies  reckons up sixteen different bodies of sectaries and a multitude of rampant errors But he is too keen to deserve intire credit And indeed such was the disorder and licentiousness in religion that it was scarcely possible to reduce them to either sects or opinions We hear of  Enthusiasts Ranters Seekers  c c many of which died in their infancy or joined with these afterward called  Quakers  It is said that about an hundred Popish clergy were sent from abroad to join the different parties in order to increase and inflame the confusions  Meanwhile the  Confession of Faith  which the Scotch divines had insisted for instead of the  Thirnine articles  was finished not without dissents relative to the  imputation of Christ's active obedience church government and discipline liberty of conscience  and along with the scripture proofs transmitted to the parliament in May and after about thirteen months and many long debates the most part of it was approved by both Houses The th chapter which relates to church censures that part of the st which relates to the calling and power of Synods great part of the th concerning marriage and divorce and that part of the th concerning the punishment of such as vent opinions destructive to the peace of the church were referred to further consideration and at last laid aside After the  Confession  and  Catechisms  were finished the Scotch commissioners went home and the remaining part of the Assembly did almost nothing but examine candidates for the ministry and dispute concerning the divine right of Presbyterian government After sitting five years and almost seven months and holding sederunts they intirely dissolved February  For some time before their dissolution the management of ecclesiastical matters was in the hands of the Provincial Synod of London which met at  Zion college twice every week in and all the twelve following years when they could At the end of every six months the members were changed and the Synod renewed The first having little opportunity of sitting did little besides agreeing upon some rules of order The second published a solemn  Testimony  against the errors of the times in which they declare their adherence to the Confession of Faith and their abhorrence of the following tenets That the scriptures of the Old and New Testament are not of divine authority nor the only rule of faith that God hath a bodily shape and is the principal author of sin that there is no Trinity of persons in the Godhead that Christ is inferior to the Father and the Holy Ghost but a ministring Spirit that God hath equally elected all men to everlasting life that no man eternally perisheth for Adam's first sin that Christ died for all mankind and the benefit of his death is intended by God for all that every man hath a free will and power in himself to repent obey the gospel and do every thing necessary for his eternal salvation that faith is not a supernatural grace that faithful actions are the only ground of our justification before God that the moral law is not a rule of life to believers that believers are as pure from sin as Christ and so need not pray for the pardon of it that God seeth no sin in his people nor chastiseth them for it that there ought to be no churches sacraments or Sabbaths that baptism ought not to be continued among Christians nor the infants of believers baptized that forswearing of one's self is the whole meaning of the d commandment that brethren and sisters may lawfully marry together and divorces be founded upon indisposition unfitness or contrariety of tempers that human souls are mortal and there is neither heaven nor hell till the day of judgment They testify against the authoritative toleration of all religions as the occasion and source of errors heresies and blasphemies They declare their adherence to the  Solemn League  and Covenant  and to the  divine right  of Presbytery and their dislike of Prelacy Erastianism Independency Brownism and their abhorrence of Antiscripturism Popery Arminianism Arianism Socinianism Antinomianism Anabaptism Libertinism and Schism This Testimony was subscribed by of the principal clergy in London and afterwards by in Gloucestershire in Lancashire in Devonshire and in Somersetshire  This year the army mad for a toleration of all or almost all pretences to religion assumed a superiority over the parliament and turned out some of the Presbyterian members Charles at once treated with the English parliament now governed by the army and with the discontented Scots that were forming an  Engagement  and raising an army to rescue him He altered his condescensions as his circumstances changed and probably intended merely to amuse his subjects with treaties relative to religion which he never meant to fulfil Notwithstanding refusal of submission and the most scurrilous abuse from the heads and students of Oxford the parliament's commissioners visited that university which for some years before had rather been a garrison than a place of learning It is hard to say whether the patience of the parliament or the insolence of the university was most remarkable during the two years in which this affair was in agitation Besides others nineteen or twenty masters were turned out and Edward Reynolds Wilkins Wslkinson Palmer Sethward Wallis L Moulin and others were put in their place Holydays and stageplays being prohibited by the parliament multitudes in some places were highly provoked and abused such as dared to work on these holy or rather revelling seasons But they had no reason as in place of them the parliament allowed servants the first Tuesday of every month for recreation and visiting of friends  In consequence of a treaty with his majesty duke Hamilton and his party of Scots invaded England  with an army to rescue him from the Parliamentarians while the English royalists took arms for the same purpose Cromwel quickly routed them both While he and his army were in the North dealing with the Scots the Presbyterian members resumed their seats in parliament and became the majority Knowing that the army were bent for a commonwealth in the state and an authoritative toleration to attend any religious establishment in the church they instigated by the more zealous clergymen enacted That whosoever should obstinately deny the existence or perfections of God or his subsistence in three persons equal in power and glory or the reality of Christ's manhood or his satisfaction to God's justice for sinful men or the divine authority of the scriptures or the resurrection of the dead or the future judgment should be punished with death That whosoever should obstinately maintain That all men shall be saved or that men can turn themselves to God or that God may be worshipped by images or that the souls of men either die with their bodies or sleep till the resurrection or that there is a purgatory or that the revelations and workings of God's Spirit are a rule of faith or practice even when different from or contrary to scripture or that men are bound to believe no more in religion than they can comprehend or that the moral law is no rule of life to believers or that believers need not repent of their sin or pray for its pardon or that baptism and the Lord's supper are not appointed in scripture to be continued in the church or that the baptism of infants is unlawful or that the strict observation of the Lord's day is not agreeable to the word of God or that public and family prayers and teaching of children to pray are unlawful or that the present English form of magistracy by king and parliament is unlawful or that all use of warlike arms is unlawfulshall be obliged publicly to recant their error in the congregations in which they had  spread it and in case of refusal be imprisoned till they find security that they will never more maintain and publish any such error They also made a new ordinance in which all their former acts relative to Presbyterian government and discipline were collected and ratified as the  standing laws  of the kingdom But no penalty was denounced against such as should not submit  The parliament also laboured to accommodate matters with his majesty who had slipt off to Newport in the Isle of Wight and were extremely fond to have the treaty concluded before their army returned from the North But notwithstanding all that their learned doctors could say to persuade him that Prelacy had no divine warrant and that he might consent to the abolishment of it and to the use of the  Directory for worship  without hurting his conscience or violating his coronation oath he instigated by his bigotted Episcopalians would make no concessions but what were extorted from him At last he in this manner consented that all the hierarchy except the bishops should be abolished that they should not act but in concert with presbyters that Presbyterian government should continue three years that after that no episcopal authority shall be exercised but by authority of parliament that if in that time he be convinced that Prelacy is not agreeable to the word of God he will utterly abolish it He soon after added that for three years he would make no new bishops and would use some other form of divine service than the Book of common prayer in his chapel and prohibit the saying of mass in the queen's The Commons voted these concessions unsatisfactory but in a few days voted otherwise The parliament's commissioners did what they could to bring him a little further and to persuade him that no Prelacy was abolished but what had been set up by human laws that there was no difficulty in the reversion of the church lands to the crown and that the Assembly's  Directory  pointed  out the matter of public prayers though not the express words But notwithstanding all that they and the Scotch commissioners from both church and state could do he would promise no more than to reduce Episcopacy to archbishop Usher's plan and to license the  Shorter Catechism  Part of the army returning from the North and finding that no toleration of dissenters from the established religion was secured by the negotiations between Charles and his parliament they were enraged at both They concluded that if he could obtain the use of the  service book  in his own chapel Independents and sectaries need expect no liberty of conscience at all and so they had been fighting to set up Presbytery and get themselves banished the country or driven into corners In these views they after a solemn fast of several days resolved to assume the government of the nation cut off the king's head and erect a Commonwealth On Nov th they presented a petition to the parliament setting forth the miscarriage of Charles' government and his dilatory and double dealing in treaties and required That he and other delinquents be brought to justice for their conduct that the prince of Wales and duke of York surrender themselves and be declared incapable of government that for the future no king be admitted but by the free election of the people  Shocked with these demands the Commons shifted the consideration of them for ten days till the treaty with his majesty was quite broken off But the army detached a party to Newport who on the very next day seized his person and brought him to Windsor Entering London they apprehended sorty of the leading Commons and refused entrance to an hundred more None were left but about or most of them officers of the army who carried every thing by direction from the council of military officers at St Alban's They made an ordinance and erected a  justiciary court  for the trial of his majesty  as a traitor to his country Because the Lords rejected their ordinance they no move acknowledged them None but Hugh Peters and John Goodwin of the Independent clergy had any hand in promoting his death The bigotted Episcopalians encouraged him in that obstinacy which occasioned it Some Episcopalians as well as Presbyterians were members of the House of Commons when the ordinance was made for his trial But I know not whether any of them concurred in it The Papists are said to have mightily promoted it in order to throw the nation into confusion and afford opportunity of introducing Popery under the Popishly educated princes or otherwise But the most furious managers of the tragedy were Sectarians Independents Anabaptists and Hobbists They solicited the Presbyterian ministers of London to side with the army or else be silent Instead of this fortyseven of them published a  monitory address  to the general and council of war representing to them their perjury and wickedness in invading the rights of parliament and seizing the king As the Prelatic divines to avert men's eyes from their own folly and guilt reproached the Presbyterians as the cause of his majesty's distress the most of those who had subscribed this address with others published a vindication of their own conduct and a warning to all the subjects to avoid every thing tending towards the toleration of heresy or blasphemyor to divide the kingdoms of England and Scotlandand calling them to bewail the sins which had thus reduced the nation and to cry to God for his majesty's deliverance Nineteen clergymen about Oxford mostly Presbyterians but some Independents addressed general Fairfax and his council of war beseeching them to lay aside all thoughts against his majesty's life and to endeavour to promote a right understanding between him and his parliament and protesting that they shall be free of their sovereign's death and of all the miseries that shall follow on it The Scots  by  remonstrances  from both church and state did what they could to save him But nothing could stop the wild career of the furious officers till they had condemned and beheaded him Jan th  Charles was sober temperate and chaste a kind husband parent and master But his encouraging of sports on Sabbath marks him no tender Christian His favour to and employment of Papists while be hated and distressed his Puritan subjects and his now well known hand in the Irish massacre are but poor evidences of his being a sincere Protestant In his treaties with his parliament want of candour and fidelity appears every where In politics his whole government was one continued series of blunders Nothing more exalted his character than the publishing of the EICON BASILIKE in his name which represented him as extremely pious and devout amidst his manifold troubles It was printed soon after his death and had more than fifty editions But it was at last discovered that Dr Gauden had wrote the whole of it except the th and th chapters which were written by Dr Duppa Since the restoration of his son in the th of January hath been by law observed in commemoration of his martyrdom on which many thousand falshoods and fulsome flatteries are yearly retailed from Episcopalian pulpits in the name of the Lord  A commonwealth being erected Cromwel and the army quickly and with no small severity reduced the Papists in Ireland About an hundred thousand of them fled into France and the rest were pent up in corners in which they could scarcely find subsistence Episcopacy was reduced the university of Dublin was purged and religion and learning flourished in it The parliament having formed an engagement or oath of allegiance to the commonwealth few Episcopalians scrupled at it Many of the Presbyterian clergy refused it and left their parishes which were filled up with Independents who mightily relished the new form of government For the  sake of peace the parliament continued the establishment of Presbyterian government and of the  Directory for worship  but abolished all penalties on account of differences in religion The Presbyterian ministers at their monthly fasts being apt to throw out reflections against the new government and managers of it the parliament abolished these meetings and prohibited clergymen's meddling with politics They also prohibited the publication or dispersion of seditious pamphlets While the parliament provided ministers and schoolmasters for Wales the Presbyterian and Independent clergy laboured fo incessantly in the instruction of their people that sobriety prevailed almost every where in the kingdom Amidst all the absurd fancies which prevailed in the army such was their strictness that when one of their quartermasters was convicted of blasphemy he had his tongue bored with an hot iron his sword broken over his head and was expelled from the troops by order of the council of the army The Papists were banished twenty miles from London and excepted in the parliament's acts of indulgence and toleration Though no penal laws were in force against the other parties yet every one was required to attend some place of meeting on the Lord's day and on days of fasting and thanksgiving unless they had some reasonable excuse Several ordinances were made to restrain uncleanness profane swearing public blasphemy or the encouragement of people to vice And for promoting the sanctification of the Sabbath they appointed that every thing  cried or put to sale  on it or on days of humiliation and thanksgiving should be seized They appointed part of the money procured by the sale of bishops lands for the support of such bishops deans and other Episcopa  ian clergy as stood in need of it They appointed Justices of peace to marry people instead of ministers and the banns to be proclaimed on three market days not on the Sabbath  Professing regard to their  covenant  the Scots had admitted Charles II as his father's successor to their crown But by defeating his forces at Dunbar and Worcester Cromwel quite ruiued their affairs Mr Gibbons a gentleman and Christopher Love a noted Presbyterian minister at London and some other Presbyterians having manifested some inclination towards the Scottish king the two first were executed as traitors to the commonwealth It doth not appear that Mr Love had any active hand but only had forborn to accuse his friends his death appeared to drown the curse of God and hatred of men on the new government  The managers finding it necessary to have a kind of sovereign Cromwel by his own instigation was chosen to be their PROTECTOR while he pretended his great unwillingness to accept of the charge The  Instrument of government  by which he obliged himself to govern the kingdom declared That the Christian religion contained in the scriptures should be held forth and recommended as the public profession of these nations that none should be obliged by penalties to conform to the public religion that all such as profess faith in God by Jesus Christ however much they differ from the public profession shall be protected in their religious exercises excep  Papists Prelatists and such as under profession o  Christianity practise or encourage licentiousness Cromwel did what he could to make all the differen  parties befriend him As the Presbyterians had a shadow of establishment on their side it was agreed▪ That no alteration should be made unless in laying aside all penalties of nonconformity Such bishop  or other Episcopalians as behaved peaceably were no  pressed with the  Engagement  Much about the time that the London minister  published their  divine right of the gospel ministry  a  a mean of restraining the disorderly preaching o  laymen Archbishop Usher J Owen T Goodwin Stephen Marshal Ph Nye Sh Simson together  with Messrs Vines Manton Jacomb Cheynel and Reyner were in appointed to fix the fundamental principles of the Christian religion according to which the toleration might be limited R Baxter who was put in the room of archbishop Usher who declined the task insisted for no more than an adherence to the  Creed Lord's prayer  and  ten commandments  But the rest agreed upon articles That the scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the standard of men's faith and practice that there is one God in three persons that Jesus Christ is God and man in one person and the only Mediator between God and men without the knowledge of whom there can be no salvation that he made satisfaction for our sin died rose again ascended to heaven and for ever continues a person distinct from angels and men that all men are by nature dead in trespasses and sins and must be born again repent and believe in order to eternal salvation that we are saved by the grace of God and faith in Christ not by our works that continuance in any known sin is damnable that God must be worshipped according to his own will that such as despise the duties of God's worship cannot be saved that at the last day the dead shall be raised the world judged and some depart into everlasting punishment and others into life eternal By these articles Deists Socinians Arians Papists Quakers and Antinomians are excluded from the benefit of the toleration But as Cromwel and his council were for protecting every one that lived peaceably no use was made of this draught  Not chusing that Presbyterial classes should have the power of admitting clergymen chiefly in their hand Cromwel and his council appointed a committee of twentynine of the most eminent ministers in England partly Presbyterians partly Independents three Anabaptists and nine gentlemen to try such as had entered the preceding year or should afterward enter to the ministry with respect to their gifts  and graces Five were stated a sufficient  quorum  to approve a man and nine to reject him As most of the members of this committee resided at London such as could not come thither were tried by a subcommittee No candidate was admitted to trial unless he produced a certificate signed by three persons of known integrity attesting upon their own knowledge that he was of an holy and good conversation Finding that some sequestred Episcopalians stood the trial and were admitted back to their charges Cromwel and his council appointed that none such should be admitted till they were satisfied of their submission to the present government Such as were rejected and their friends exclaimed terribly against the TRIERS proceedings But Baxter who was far enough from loving the chief men among them says They did much good to the church saved many congregations from drunken ignorant and ungodly teachers and admitted such as were learned godly and serious be of what tolerable opinion they would only they too much favoured the Independents and were too apt to reject Episcopalians and Arminians If the candidate's learning orthodoxy piety and peaceableness were manifestly certain as in the case of Fuller the historian they made little enquiry into his gracious experiences But when they knew him to be malignant immoral a Pelagian or Socinian they by examination of his experiences and the like laboured to have him rejected  As notwithstanding all former purgations there still remained not a few scandalous or negligent pastors and teachers Cromwel and his council appointed for every county a committee of laymen with ten or more ministers to purge them out and allow them a th part of their salary for the support of their familiesIn an ordinance had been made for the purgation and proper settlement of the churches in Wales But though they had got ministers who laboured to their utmost they were not nearly supplied Some itinerant preachers were therefore  appointed to labour among them for the present Some of the lesser congregations were joined together and others of the largest sort were divided New committees were appointed to visit the universities of Cambridge and Oxford These as well as the Heads of the colleges faithfully executed their offices in consequence of which sobriety and godliness remarkably prevailed in these seminaries of learning Stillingfleet Pearson Patrick Lowth and others of the greatest men that ever appeared in the English church were bred up under these Puritan doctors and nothing but horrid impiety and tyranny felt the exclusion of the royal bigotsMeanwhile the Presbyterian Synod of London finding it impossible to establish their discipline among the English and awakened by the spread of two Catechisms published by Biddle a Socinian bestirred themselves to promote the religious education of youth and published exhortations and directions for ministers and heads of families in their catechizing work Animated by their example the associated ministers in several counties published similar exhortations  As the Royalists had threatened Cromwel with an assassination and had published most dangerous libels against the present government he by a proclamation ordered that no ejected Episcopalians should be chaplains or schoolmasters or preach or teach any but their own families under pain of prosecution But he more secretly intimated that those who since their sequestration had or should give proper evidence of their godliness and affection to the present government should be used as kindly as could consist with the safety of the state About the same time he threatened the Papists not so much for their religion as because he found them enemies to his government The Protestants of Savoy and Piedmont being terribly persecuted he by application to the kings of Sweden and Denmark the States of Holland and the Reformed churches in Germany  and France procured them large contributions In England alone pounds were collected He dispatched Moreland his envoy to the duke of Savoy to intimate to him that he intended to exert himself to his uttermost for the deliverance of his persecuted Protestant brethren He wrote to Lewis XIV and to cardinal Mazarine his minister to the same effect Unwilling to have Cromwel and his troops so near him Mazarine pressed the court of Turin to give the Protestants satisfaction To strike terror into the Pope and other Italian princes he gave out that as he understood they had encouraged the persecution he intended that his fleet should visit their coasts and cause the sound of his canons to be heard at Rome He publicly declared that he would allow no Protestants to be any where insulted and procured indulgence to those of Bohemia and France  How disgraceful to the Protestant powers that they have ever since so little copied his example  Whether he had any hand in founding the charitable fund for the support of ministers widows and children which took place about this time I know not  The indulgence of so many forms of religion in England drew the famous Manasseh ben Israel and other rabbies of the Jewish nation thither to solicit a freedom for their religion and traffick As Cromwel thought they might by the pure preaching of the gospel be converted to Christ and might push the English into trade he inclined to grant them their request But in order to do it peaceably he conveened a council of lawyers merchants and divines to consider whether it would consist with the laws of the land the advantage of trade and rule  of the gospel Some were altogether against their admission lest they should seduce people to their religion or customs of marriage and divorce or their fraud hurt the trade of the subjects Others though  they might be admitted providing they should speak or write nothing against the honour of Christ or hi  religion should hold no judicatory civil or ecclesias+tical  should use no Christian servants should bear no public office or trust should discourage none from using means of conviction of the truth of the Christian religion and that if any should apostatize to Judaism they should be severely punished The opinions of these advisers being so different the affair was dropt  In the Quakers had become considerably troublesome and insolent even to Cromwel himself which drew upon them some severities The Papists had an oath imposed upon them abjuring the Pope's supremacy transubstantiation purgatory worship of images and relicksthe merit of human works the Pope's power to excommunicate or depose magistrates or give allowance to murder themand declaring that they believed him to have no power at all in Britain or Ireland and that no power derived from him or the church of Rome could absolve from this oath Two thirds of their estate who refused this oath were to be seized for public use and all British subjects were prohibited to hear mass in the house of any foreign ambassador  In Brian Walton afterwards bishop of Chester published his famous  Polyglot Bible  in six large volumes folio in the preparation and correction of which he had employed not a few of the most learned Puritans and others Dr Owen highly commended the work but blamed Walton for pretending that the Hebrew points were not of divine authority and for collecting so many  various readings  from copies of no importance About this time also the Royal Society began to be founded  In the Independents by Cromwel's permission held an Assembly at the Savoy and drew up their  Confession of Faith  It differs but little from that of Westminster unless that the th and st chapters relative to censures and Synods and part of the th d and th relative to the power of civil magistrates about religious matters and to marriage and divorce are left out It hath a chapter  relative to the  Gospel  and some expressions more plainly pointed against the then rampant errors and at the end it hath a chapter relative to the institution of the church and to ecclesiastical discipline At this meeting in which there were ministers and members from churches tho' Dr Owen Mess Goodwin Nye Bridges Caryl and Greenhill were the principal managers it is the less wonder that they formed their Confession in a few days The difference between it and that of Westminster being so small that the modern Independents have almost laid it aside and use that of Westminster as well as the Presbyterians excepting the portions above mentioned  Death having that same year cut off the bold and crafty and perhaps pious Protector the government devolved on Richard his son a young man of a candid and peaceable temper Fleetwood his brotherinlaw and Desborough who had married his aunt and Lambert and other discontented spirits resumed their courage and quickly obliged him to resign his authority A  commonwealth  of a few weeks duration ensued but the officers finding that the parliament intended to reduce the army took the government into their own hands The nation being quickly sick of these military lords the Presbyterians and Royalists agreed to bring home Charles of Scotland who had been an exile abroad Having invited General Monk from Scotland he by ways and means dishonourable enough got to London restored the Presbyterian members of parliament to their seats from which they had been excluded in and placed guards about the House which deterred the Independents from entering Being now almost wholly Presbyterians the Commons ratified the vote of bearing that Charles I's concessions from the Isle of Wight were a satisfactory ground of a pacification with him They annulled the  engagement  of to be faithful to the commonwealth and the late oath  abjuring  Charles Stewart  In consequence of a petition from the London ministers they approved the  Solemn League and Covenant  they declared the  Westminster Confession of Faith  the public Confession of the church of England but agreed that due liberty in religious matters be secured according to the word of God They approved as valid the ordinations of ministers according to the  Directory  and gave Presbyterian ministers full possession of their benefices In May they dissolved themselves after they had in divers forms and with several interruptions sat  nineteen  years four months and thirteen days  Before their dissolution they had enacted That none who had warred against the parliament si  ce and had not since manifested their affection to it should be elected members for the next and that all candidates should declare the parliament's war against king Charles to have been just and lawful But now to avoid all choice of republicans many Royalists and persons absolutely atheistical and profane were chosen Meanwhile Monk began to treat with Charles king of Scots and several of the Presbyterian ministers repaired to him at Breda in Holland His embracement of Popery beginning to make a noise he decoyed several of the most eminent Protestant clergymen in France to give assurances of the contrary He transmitted to London a DECLARATION promising a general pardon of past offences and a liberty in religion to all his subjects if he should be restored to his throne Infatuated by his guileful prayers and deceitful declarations and by the fine promises of Episcopalians of whose perfidiousness they had had sufficient experience the Presbyterians permitted the new parliament to invite him home without any terms After this parliament had sat about eight months they were dissolved because the members had not been chosen by virtue of royal warrants and many of them were Presbyterians and they had declared the late war with his majesty's father to have been lawful  CHARLES had no sooner arrived at Whitehall than for a blind he made Mess Manton Calamy Baxter Bates Reynolds Spurstow Ash Case and Woodbridge all Presbyterians his ordinary chaplains But the  old  liturgy was restored in his chapel and elsewherepretending that the acts of the long parliament being in themselves null for want of the royal assent  Episcopacy  and the  service book  were still established by law The members of parliament quickly set the nation an example in the taking the sacrament in the ceremonious form Before the year ended many parochial clergymen were prosecuted for not using the  service book  the judges pretending That the laws returned with the king and that the breaches of them could not be dispensed with The sequestred Episcopalians flocked about the court magnified their own sufferings as a kind of martyrdom for his majesty's right and notwithstanding their most notorious scandals were restored to their former places and the pious learned and laborious Presbyterians or Independents turned out to make way for them Within about six months above doctors of divinity and as many of law physic  c  were formed out of the selfapplauding Royalists But as most of their names stand nowhere but in the registers of the university they appear to have been generally of very little importance A little before the Restoration a fruitless attempt had been made to fill the vacant sees lest the episcopal succession should be ruined but deans and chapters being now restored to every cathedral ten new bishops were added to the nine survivors Other four were soon after added Four or five sees were kept vacant that they might be offered as a bait to the leading divines of the Presbyterian persuasion  In the preceding period which hath been so much reproached as an age of horrid rebellion the universities abounded with pious and learned Teachers and Students Never did another produce so many or so  remarkable ornaments to the English church Better laws were never made in England nor good laws ever so well executed The dress the language and conversation of the people were sober and virtuous Scarcely one instance of bankruptcy was known in a year nor could bankrupts ever regain their character Drunkenness whoredom profane swearing and other debaucheries were quite out of fashion To live as beasts without worshipping God in secret and in families was held infamous Not one stage play was acted for many years in the whole kingdom Magistrates carefully suppressed gaming and other abuses in public houses Ministers laboured in praying preaching catechizing and visiting their people to the wasting of their strength But no sooner had Charles ascended his throne than debauchery and wickedness of every form like an impetuous torrent brake forth and overflowed all ranks in the kingdom He set them a most brutish and infernal example He did not believe there was any such thing as honour or virtue but all men were guided by self interest Atheism profane scoffing and swearing were his daily delight drunkenness and whoredom his principal business He could scarcely spare an hour from them to mind the affairs of the state If we may believe his own bishops and doctors he ordinarily came from the bed of his harlots to church or even to the Lord's table Two playhouses were erected in the neighbourhood of his court Female actresses were introduced on the stage Plays so lewd and obscene as might have made Beelzebub to blush were composed and acted Scarcely any thing was to be seen at court but feasting hard drinking revelling whoredom and profane swearing The favoured clergymen were taken with whores almost every week or found drunk in the streets or even in the pulpits All kinds of riot and debauchery prevailed among the people Some who had been Parliamentarians to redeem their credit with the court and the clerical managers threw off their former  mask of religion turned profane scoffers and forged stories to render their old friends ridiculous To appear serious read the Bible pray in secret or in families or to make conscience of speech or behaviour characterized one a  fanatic  Forbearing to extol the ceremonies marked one a Presbyterian rebel  Provoked with the Presbyterians for their siding themselves in the late wars and for holding so many livings in the church in which they laboured in winning souls to Christ and for being capable to influence the election of members of parliament and why not also for their  mad zeal  in bringing home Charles that  plague of God  to the throne Clarendon and his bishops resolved to ruin them and exclude them from all comprehension in the church while James duke of York and his Papists inclined to have a toleration for them that they might share in it Still the infatuated Presbyterians courted the favour of those managers that wished their ruin They offered archbishop Usher's plan of church government as a mean of accommodationand insisted that the  surplice  the  crossing  in baptism and  kneeling  at the Lord's supper should be left indifferent and some corrections made upon the  Thirtynine articles  In June Messrs Calamy Reynolds Ashe Baxter Wallis Manton and Spurstow introduced by the earl of Manchester besought his majesty to interpose his influence for the healing of their ecclesiastical differences hoping as Baxter said that he would outdo Cromwel the usurper in promoting religion Charles bade them draw up their proposals relative to church government and ceremonies as low as p  ssible and then he would procure them a conference with the episcopal doctors Having finished it they along with their brethren in London presented their proposals bearing That they agreed with their brethren in the doctrinal points of religion and the substantial parts of divine worship but humbly requested That none of their serious people  might be reproached with abusive language that no scandalous negligent or insufficient person might be admitted pastor in any congregation that none should be confirmed by the bishops or admitted to the Lord's table without a credible profession of faith and holiness that effectual care should be taken for the public and private sanctification of the Lord's day that Episcopacy be reduced to the plan proposed by archbishop Usher in that suffragans be chosen by their respective Synods that in their visitations bishops regulate their conduct by the appointments of parliament that the  Book of common prayer  be either corrected and purged of that which is offensive or a committee of moderate Episcopalians and Presbyterians appointed to compile a new one as much in scripture language as possible and ministers not be confined to precise forms and that crossing in baptism kneeling at the Lord's supper observation of holy days of human appointment officiating in surplices altars in churches bowing at the name JESUS or towards altars be abolished or at least not imposed on such as scruple them The answer given to this representation by the Episcopalians occasioned a short and somewhat warm answer by the Presbyterians  As many of the sober ministers began to be driven from their churches on account of their not using the  Book of common prayer  the chief Presbyterians besought his majesty to suspend these executions till the issue of their attempts for an accommodation were known and that he would revoke the ejection of such as had only succeeded to deceased Episcopalians and prevent the return of scandalous clergymen to their former charges But all was to little purpose After hearing both parties he corrected and published his  second Declaration  in which he promised to reform Episcopacy and have the Liturgy corrected and that none should be questioned for differences in religion not tending to disturb the peace of the kingdom Not a few of the Presbyterian clergy were  pleased with this thanked his majesty for it and upon the foot of it pious Edward Reynolds accepted the bishoprick of Norwich and Dr Manton receiving a living in Convent garden submitted to episcopal ordination by Sheldon bishop of London and to the use of the  service book  in his church Other Presbyterians still dissatisfied again besought his majesty to establish archbishop Usher's scheme of church government which they thought was consistent with their Solemn League and Covenant and insisted for further alterations in the  service book  than he appeared to have promised They prevailed nothing When the last mentioned  declaration  was first read in parliament Nov th both Houses agreed on an address of thanks for it but being informed that Charles and his courtiers never intended to stand to it the Commons refused to give it a second reading  By this time the long infatuated Presbyterians had their eyes opened and plainly perceived that his majesty's declarations were but crafty expedients to keep them quiet till their Episcopalian enemies could bid them defiance and they had daily more and more evidence that they had no favour at court If they spoke or wrote in favour of their covenant with God and one another if they lamented the dreadful irruption of perfidy apostacy or vice especially of courtiers if they scrupled using of the surplice service book and ceremonies they were prosecuted in the ecclesiastical courts and hundreds of them turned out to make way even for the most scandalous Episcopalians who had been formerly ejected Meanwhile flocks of Papists came home magnified their sufferings in the late times and published a list of about of their noblemen knights baronets and other persons of rank who had lost their lives in fighting for Charles and his father His mother returned from France with a crowd of Popish attendants The priests who had been in gaol were liberated and others came over from the college  of Douay More Papists appeared in England than in all the twelve preceding years In Ireland too which under the late troubles had been not a little furnished with faithful laborious and successful ministers from England and Scotland the Papists took possession of their old estates and turned out the Protestant purchasers Their priests sent over an Address congratulating his majesty's  restoration  and requesting the free exercise of their religion Their Address was graciously received and they were encouraged to hope for a favourable answer Charles' marriage with the Infanta of Portugal also contributed to the promoting of their interests  Venner a winehooper and about fifty others of the  Fifthmonarchy men  who imagined that the  thousand years  empire of Jesus Christ's personal reign on earth was just to be erected took arms resolving to overturn Charles' government or perish in the attempt This madness crushed in a moment gave the court an handle for emitting a proclamation prohibiting all Anabaptists Quakers and Fifthmonarchy men to meet for worship any where but in parish churches or chapels or in their own houses The Independents Baptists and Quakers for their own vindication published a declaration of their abhorrence of Venner's insurrection To provoke the Presbyterians to some like outrage the Episcopalians or Papists insulted them in the streets and disturbed them at their family worship by blowing of horns at their windows or the like Amidst all this abuse they maintained a quiet and inviolated loyalty tho' from the Press they honestly contended for their religious principles Stillingfleet a very learned and as yet mild Episcopalian published his  Irenicum  in which he pled That no particular form of church government is exhibited in the New Testament and with great strength of argument contended that nothing ought to be imposed in religion but what is clearly revealed in the scriptures nothing required but what is plainly indifferent nothing indifferent  required as a part of worship but only as a mean of duly performing it that no penalty ought to be inflicted upon persons who scruple at any thing not clearly revealed in the word of God till they have sufficient time and means to be informed of the lawfulness of it and that religion ought not to be clogged with ceremonies as too many of them eat out the life and vigour of Christianity But no reasoning was able to restrain the fury of the Episcopalians against the Presbyterians who had so kindly brought home their king and put them into possession of their power  The new parliament formed to the taste of the court which kept about an hundred members in pay to vote as they pleased sat down May th Besides advancing his majesty's absolute power they declared the solemn league and covenant illegal and not binding upon such as had taken it and ordered it to be publicly burnt by the hangman they restored the bishops to their jurisdiction in parliament or otherwise the restored to the Episcopalian clergy all the power they had enjoyed under his majesty's father except the use of the oath  ex officio  they denounced a  Premuniro  against all such as should call his majesty a Papist they enacted that all in places of power and trust should declare upon oath that they believed it unlawful to take up arms against the king  on any pretence  whatsoever and give it under their hand that they renounce the  solemn league and covenant  as an unlawful oath imposed contrary to the standing laws of the kingdom they appointed that none should act in any civil office who had not within a year received the Lord's supper according to the  service book  they appointed commissioners to visit all the corporations in the kingdom and turn out of office all such as were suspected of disrelishing the measures of the court A sham plot against the government fathered upon captain Yarrington Sparry Mr Baxter and others was trumpetted up and reported through the nation in order to  make the penal laws against the Presbyterians and other dissenters pass the more easily Meanwhile several of the French Protestant clergymen who had persuaded the Presbyterians to receive Charles without any conditions barefacedly congratulated the Episcopalians upon their reestablishment and the French pastor at the Savoy conformed himself to the English ceremonies  By virtue of his majesty's last declaration twelve bishops and nine assistants were appointed to meet with the Presbyterian chiefs at the Savoy for fixing what alterations were proper for the satisfaction of tender consciences and promoting of the good of the church Calamy Baxter and their brethren excepted against eight things in the  Book of common prayer  as plainly sinful  viz  that no minister is allowed to baptize any without using the sign of the cross that no minister is allowed to officiate in the public worship of God without wearing the surplice that none are allowed to receive the Lord's supper but on their knees that ministers are obliged to administer the Lord's supper to unfit persons whether in health or in sickness and even to some who are unwilling to receive it that ministers are obliged without any conditions to absolve from scandal and guilt of sin persons of whose repentance they have not the smallest evidence that they are obliged at funerals to give thanks for all baptized and unexcommunicated persons deceased as brethren whom God hath taken to himself and that none are allowed to preach the gospel who do not under their subscription declare that there is nothing in the  Thirty nine articles Books of common prayer and ordination  contrary to the word of God They even presented a draught of a  new liturgy  drawn up by Mr Baxter the prayers in which were mostly in the express words of scripture which they begged ministers might be allowed to use The bishops took it as an horrid affront to put a production of Baxter on a level with the long approved  biturgy  of their church As the intention  of the leading Episcopalians in this dispute was no  to accommodate matters but to discover the Presbyterians scruples that they might so fix their term  of communion as effectually to exclude them they did not allow them opportunity of fair calm and thorough reasoning but by browbeating and by the hissing of their attendants studied to throw them into confusion When the conference was finished▪ a convocation was called to rectify what was amiss in the prayer book and to supply deficiencies Care was taken to have it composed of such as hated the Presbyterians or were the obedient dupes of their superiors They added prayers for the annual celebration of the  martyrdom  of Charles I on the th of January and of his present majesty's  restoration  on May thand for persons at sea a form of baptism for adult persons They added some new holy days and some new lessons out of the Apocrypha as the stupid fable of Bel and the dragon and so made the book still more exceptionable They began to review the CANONS but made no alterations  Charles and his agents did not content themselves with prosecuting such of his father's condemnators as were still alive but digged up the bodies of Bradshaw and Ireton and gave them a kind of execution They also digged up the bodies of Cromwel's mother and daughter and of admiral Blake Pym Dr Twisse Stephen Marshal and fourteen others of the Parliamentarians to put a public stigma upon them These were but the most harmless pieces of their cruelty By the instigation of the court in May the Commons with great readiness and the Lords with no small reluctance passed the  Act of uniformity  importing That every minister that did not before the feast of Bartholomew August th before his congregation when publicly assembled for religious worship declare his unfeigned assent and consent to every thing contained in the  Book of common prayer  as lately corrected and in the  Form of ordination of bishops priests and deacons  should be  ipso facto  deprived of all his spiritual promotions that all ministers or teachers in colleges schools or families who did not before said day declare under their hand That it is not lawful  upon any pretence  to take arms against the king and that they renounce the  solemn league  as unlawful and  not binding  on the takers of it and that they will conform to the church of England as by law established shall be deprived of their livings if they have any and  eachers in colleges or schools shall for every offence suffer three months imprisonment and that none wanting Episcopalian ordination shall administer the Lord's supper under pain of pounds for every offence that no other form of  common prayer  shall be used in public worship that none shall be admitted as lecturers who are not approved and licensed by a bishop and read the  Thirtynine articles  and declare their unfeigned  assent  and  consent  to the whole of themand at their first lecture and afterwards on the first lecture day of each month before lecturing or preaching read the common prayer and serviceIt also ratified all the laws made for uniformity of prayer  c  As there were not quite three months of interval between the passing and the final execution of this act it was impossible for the  newly corrected  Book of common prayer to be got printed dispersed through all the corners of England and read and considered before the time elapsed Nevertheless seven thousand Episcopalian clergymen of whom not one in forty it is said had seen it believed as the church did  nd from their pulpits solemnly declared their  unfeigned assent  and  consent  to it Meanwhile the Presbyterian and Independent ministers were so squeamish that they could not solemnly declare their  unfeigned assent and consent  to every thing they knew not and they had unconquerable scruples at all the new terms of the established uniformity They could not to the reproach of the foreign churches and of all their own former ministrations which God had remarkably  blessed renounce their former ordination they could not allow themselves to lie concerning the Holy Ghost that he  now moved  them to take upon them the office of a deacon in order to be ordained by a bishop They could not give an  unfeigned assent and consent  to every thing in the  service book  they could not believe that baptism even of the infants of parents notoriously wicked produced real regeneration and gave undoubted certainty of salvation to such as died before commission of actual sin they could not give their  assent and consent  to the use of godfathers and godmothers to the exclusion of the real parents from being sponsors for their own children in baptism nor to the exclusion of Christian infants from baptism for the mere want of godfathers or godmothers they could not consent to the use of the cross in baptism or to deny baptism to their infants who scrupled at the use of it Most of them thought the consideration of that crossing as a representation o  the cause and effects of redemption according to the th canon was to make it a superadded sacrament they could not consent to  kneel  at the Lord's supper▪ at least to exclude from it all such as scrupled at it They could not assent and consent that bishops priests and deacons are theee distinct orders by divine appointment as the  Book of ordination  asserted They could not consent with the  funeral service  to pronounce all those undoubtedly saved who had it allowed them  viz  all except the unbaptized excommunicated and selfmurderers they could no  consent to read the legends of Bel and the dragon or of Tobit Judith and Baruch and other apocryphal lessons to the number of chapters in the public worship of God under the title and notion o  holy scripture for two months together to the exclusion of the word of God they could not approve the Popish translation of the Psalter even when contrary to the established translation of the Bible they could not consent that none should be admitted to  the Lord's supper before they were  confirmed  or desired to be so No doubt some of them scrupled at the reading of prayers the priests and people saying them by turns or the vain repetitions in them Nor was it a recommendation of the collects or short prayers that of them had been taken out of the Mass book and some of them made worse than even there They could not take the oath of obedience to their superior clergy according to the canons nor according to the import of that oath swear that they were ready to declare those excommunicated who charged the Book of common prayer with containiog any thing contrary to the word of God or who affirmed that any of the  Thirtynine articles  cannot be subscribed with a safe conscienceor affirmed that the ceremonies of the church of England cannot be approved and used with a good conscienceor affirmed that the government of the church of England by bishops deans archdeacons  c  as contrary to the word of Godor who should affirm that the English form of consecrating bishops priests and deacons contains in it any thing contrary to the word of Godor who should separate from the church of England or hold separated societies to be true churchesthey could not assent and consent that all should be excommunicated who should affirm that a convocation called by the royal authority is not a true representation of the church of Englandor should affirm that absents are not bound by their decrees when ratified by the king and the rather that the principal writers of the English church are far from being agreed concerning the seat of the supreme ecclesiastical power They could not under oath submit to the suspension deprivation or excommunication of such ministers as repenting of their engagements to uniformity omitted some of the ceremonies and kept private fasts They could not swear to refuse the Lord's supper to one who scrupled to receive it  kneeling  or belonged to another congregation whose pastor was scandalous  or did not preach they could not swear to promote the excommunication of such as go to other parishes than their own to receive baptism and the Lord's supperor to suspend people from the Lord's table because they do not provide surplices for their priestsor to baptize all children offered without exceptionor to present to the bishop or his chancellor every year all their parishioners above the age of sixteen who did not communicate at the preceding  Easter  that they may be prosecuted with excommunication and imprisonment for life if they afterward neglect it Moreover they could not swear canonical obedience to their  ordinary  as he not only means the bishop but also his lay judges deacons officials commissaries surragates  c  by whom church government is separated from the pastoral office contrary to the injunctions of Christ Tho' many of them had never taken the  solemn league and covenant  yet they could not renounce it as  null  and  void  and  not binding  upon the takers of it in every thing not contrary to the word of God They thought such a renunciation wicked in itself and calculated to tempt the king who had repeatedly taken it and many thousands more to harden themselves in perjury Besides the scruples which some of them had at the oaths of allegiance and supremacy as then imposed they generally scrupledsolemnly to declare That it was unlawful and horrid to take arms against the king or any commissioned by him upon  any pretence whatsoever  For these and the like scruples about of the most pious and diligent ministers in England were turned out from their charges withou  the allowance of one farthing for the support of thei  families  Never had history witnessed such an extensive ex+clusion of church men or so barbarous At the re+formation not above of the Popish clergy wer  deprived by Elizabeth and even they had an allow+ance granted them for their subsistence When th  long parliament and Cromwel turned out the scan+dalous  Episcopolian clergy they allowed them a th part of their salary to maintain them even though they were in a state of war with them as royalists Now above two thousand who had laboured for his majesty's restoration and were generally most pious and diligent ministers were forced from their charges without the smallest allowance Baxter and some other leading men quitted their churches before the time lest false reports of their intended compliance should seduce any of their brethren Reynolds Wilkins Hopkins and Fowler complied and were made bishops Some who had dissuaded their brethren complied themselves No doubt the distressful circumstances to which the ejected were quickly reduced influenced them Some of them applied themselves to civil business and were supported by donations from their friends Many of them having no freedom to alienate themselves from the public service of God to which they had solemnly devoted themselves in ordinations and otherwise unable to resist the calls of the people who begged their assistance in the salvation of their souls afraid of the curse of the unprofitable servant who hid his Lord's moneysensible of the insufficiency of those that were placed in their chargesand convinced of the continuance of their office and mission from Christ and of their duty to perpetuate a faithful ministrypresumed to preach the gospel for which as fast as they could be apprehended they were cast into prison where many of them perished by hunger and coldtheir hearers sharing much the like persecution  The condition of the English church was now exceedingly deplorable The old clergymen were generally despised and detested because of their scandalous behaviour Such as had been trained up under the Puritans did some service but many of them had neither due age nor experience A staunch but candid Episcopalian informs us That about were admitted who were unfit to take charges because  of their youth that clergymen were scandalous and many of them ignorantand about factiousthat of ecclesiastical livings were impropriated and sinecures After all these deductions how little room is left for an honest and painful ministry  Charles and his Popish courtiers and friends were glad how many of them were turned out from the church as they hoped it might occasion a toleration for the Papists along with others When the Protestant nonconformists talked of retiring to Holland or New England the courtiers or Papists dissuaded them by hints of a tolerationand laboured to divide them from the established clergy as much as possible Even the conform clergy were split into two parties The  court party  which furiously railed against the Presbyterians and their moderate brethrenzealous bigots for the ceremonies and for passive obedience to kings let them be as tyrannical as they will but careless of the instruction or morals of their people They for forty years were most numerous and stood fair for preferment The  country party  to which Reynolds Wilkins Cudworth Whichcot Tillotson and for a time Stillingfleet belonged were much superior in sense and grieved at the exclusion and persecution of the Presbyterians  Encouraged by Charles and his courtiers and driven by persecution the Presbyterians through Manton Baxter and Calamy besought him to devise some method of allowing them to teach his subjects obedience to him and to God Clarendon and bishop Sheldon of London who mortally hated them opposed every degree of indulgence Nevertheless about four months after when Clarendon was absent▪ and perhaps none but real Papists in the council▪ Charles declared his intentions to procure a parlia+mentary indulgence for his Protestant and other subjects who could not in conscience comply with th  established religion When the parliament met th  Commons presented an address against any indul+gence  So the Presbyterian ministers were left to shift for themselves Baxter Bates Calamy and some others attended as laymen on their parish churches before or after they had exercised their ministry in private houses Others forbore all manner of conformity  In Sheldon succeeded Juxon in the archbishoprick of Canterbury The courtiers which had procured the severity of the terms of conformity as a mean of occasioning indulgence to the Papists instigated the Protestant dissenters to apply for a toleration hinting that if they did not obtain it they would be forced to the uniformity established The Independents applied but the Presbyterians knowing that it was properly designed for the Papists forbore and thus drew on themselves the frowns of both courtiers and persecuted brethren Meanwhile some republicans having talked too freely it was pretended that the Independents Baptists and Fifthmonarchists had formed a plot against the king This served for an handle of reviving the act of Elilizabeth condemning to banishment and to death in case of return such as peremptorily refused attendance at their parish churchesand further enacting That every person above sixteen years of age that should be present at any dissenting meeting for the worship of God in which above four more than the family were present should for the first offence pay five pounds or ly three months in prisonfor the second pay ten pounds or ly six months in prisonand for the third pay an hundred pounds or suffer seven years banishment not to return under pain of death Married women were to ly two months in prison unless their husbands paid two pounds for their redemptionand the persons in whose house the meeting was held to be liable as other offenders Dreadful was the execution of this act among the Protestant dissenters If they did not immediately pay their fines their goods were seized and if these did not satisfy the law their persons were hurried  to prison To make the matter still worse spies and informers were placed every where who had part of the fines for their hire To avoid the penalty of obstinate absenting from church many Presbyterians occasionally attended But the Independents Baptists and Quakers looking upon persecution as an undoubted mark of a false church utterly refused their attendance Such was the severity of the Judges that some were afraid to pray in their families or ask a blessing on their meals if above four of their friends were present  In the plague raging in London and places about till eight or ten thousand died in a week and about an hundred thousand were cut off most of the established clergy fled and left their people to die and be damned as they pleased But Messrs Chester Janeway Turner Grimes Franklin Vincent and other persecuted ministers at the double hazard of their lives from the pestilence and from their persecutors flew to the city  c  and by preaching to multitudes who looked for an almost immediate appearance before the tribunal of God had remarkable success in winning of souls to Christ and preparing them for death Instead of calling the nation to humble themselves under the mighty hand of God the parliament which had fled to Oxford took this opportunity to rain down their vengeance on the Puritan ministers and enacted That they should be obliged to swear That it was unlawful to take up arms against the king or any commissioned by him on any account and that they would never endeavour any alteration in the government of either church or state And further enacted That if before taking of this oath they should come within five miles of the places in which they had been pastors or of any city corporation or borough even in travelling the road they should be fined of forty pounds for every offence and that if they refused this oath they should be incapable of teaching a private school or of boarding or dieting any persons  to be instructed No honest man as Southamptch observed could take this oath as it stood But the Judges declaring that by  commissioned  by the king was meant  legally commissioned  and by  not endeavouring  to alter the government was meant  not unlawfully endeavouring  to alter it Bates Howe and about forty others of the Presbyterian clergy took it in that sense to avoid the charge of sedition But most of the ejected ministers refused it altogether and were exposed to the most terrible hardships Some refused them houses unless at extravagant rents Others were afraid to admit them into their houses lest it should render them suspected Some ministers boldly preached till they were cast into prison choosing rather to perish in suffering for Christ than to be starved Some of them rode thirty or forty miles and preached in the night to their flocks Instigated by the informers the soldiers committed terrible outrages on their families Next year a fire kindled by the Papists having burnt dwellinghouses and eightynine churches in London several Presbyterians and Independents ventured to set up meetings the best way they could for preaching the gospel  Clarendon having lost his credit at court and being soon after banished could no more wreak his malice against the Protestant dissenters But when Charles in moved for a general toleration to nonconformists the Commons begged him to put the penal laws in execution against the conventicles or meetings of Protestant dissenters for worshipping of God Charles grew sick of the tyrannical cruelty of Sheldon and other bishops who adhered to the maxims of Clarendon and blamed the indolence and misbehaviour of the established clergy▪ for provoking the Puritans to absent from the church and set up conventicles The miseries occasioned by the Dutch war the decay of trade and fears occasioned by the French invasion of the Low Countries awakened such as had any conscience or consideration  Lord keeper Bridgeman Judge Hale bishops Reynolds and Wilkins doctors Burton Tillotson Stillingfleet and others thought it high time to promote the peace of the church and the union of Protestants in the nation and devised a plan of comprehension for moderate dissenters and of toleration for others Wilkins and Burton formed an overture of correction of the Books of  common prayer  and  ordination  with which Baxter Bates and Manton were almost pleased and no doubt Dr Owen and his brethren would have been glad of the three years toleration proposed Judge Hale prepared a Bill for the parliament answerable to their agreements but the persecuting bishops prevented its appearance and contrary to his majesty's inclination revived the prosecutions against the Protestant dissenters As the reasonableness of toleration began to be warmly disputed without doors S Patrick afterward bishop of Ely and many others who courted preferment laboured by their publications to render the dissenters odious Parker afterward bishop of Oxford abused them in the most false and virulent manner Dr Owen published a sober refutation But Andrew Marvel's  rehearsal transprosed  went more to the quick Its delicate though keen satyre made almost every body read it Nor do I know that it received any other reply than by one of Parker's friends sending Andrew a letter swearing That if be printed it his throat should be cut But God's providence preserved him as an honour to the House of Commons and to his nation The well known Sherlock abusively ridiculed the Calvinist principles and experiences founded on them and was answered by Polhill and Alsop Nay the pious behaviour edifying sermons and even the texts of the Puritan ministers became a leading topic of the abusive ridicule of the stage  King queen and court were altogether shameless in wickedness They went about masked entered  into houses and committed the vilest indecencies and maddest frolicks Wilmot afterwards earl of Rochester and other uncommonly debauched profligates were their principal favourites What money the parliament bestowed upon Charles he threw away upon his freaks and whores Nor were the Commons niggardly of what was not theirs but the nation's Licentious profaneness prevailed in both universities The harangues of the young clergy were stuffed with encomiums on the church and satyres against the dissenters while the truths of the gospel and practical religion were quite out of fashion Regardless how many thousands or millions ran headlong to hell in ignorance or impiety the ecclesiastical managers directed all their zeal against the Puritans A new act was made in bearing That every such preacher should forfeit twenty pounds for the first offence and forty for the second that whoever knowingly suffered conventicles in their houses or yards should forfeit twenty pounds for each offencethat the fines should be levied by seizing and selling the offender's goods and the third part of them given to the informer that Justices of peace might break into any place where they were informed of a conventicle and apprehend all the persons presentthat such Justices as refused to execute this act should forfeit five pounds for each offence that no defects or mistakes in the warrant for apprehending such conventiclers should render them illegal that all clauses in this act of parliament shall to the utmost be explained in opposition to conventicles and such as attend them Many Justices of peace who had any honesty or humanity resigned their office rather than be concerned in executing this abominable act Multitudes of the vilest miscreants commenced Informers and what they gained by fines almost innumerable they spent in drunkenness and whoredom Archbishop Sheldon sent his bishops another circular letter worthy of the Spanish Inquisition in order to quicken their  persecution of every body concerned in conventicle  and copies of it were sent to the officers in ever  parish For not bringing in Pen and Mead Quaker  guilty of attending a conventicle in the streets  London the members of the jury were fined in fort  marks sterling each and thrown into prison till the  paid itwhile these Quakers themselves were sine  and imprisoned  Assisted by the lords Clifford and Shaftsbury wi  the earl of Arlington and dukes of Buckingham and Lauderdale commonly called the CABAL Char+les made wide steps toward absolute power Th  exchequer was shut up that no payment of pub+lic debt could be obtained At the instigation o  Lewis XIV of France who pensioned the king an  his courtiers with a million sterling yearly it wa  resolved to destroy the Dutch because they wer  Protestants In Charles published an  indul+gence  but it was principally in favours of the Papists of whose increase the Commons had complained Though the dissenters mightily disliked an  indulgenc  founded on the king's arbitrary power to dispens  with the laws yet many of them took the opportu+nity of setting up meetings for public worship A weekly lecture was set up at  Pinner's Hall  in which four leading Presbyterians and two Independents a+greed to preach by turns in defence of the doctrine  of the Reformation in opposition to Popery Socinianism and infidelity Baxter Bates Manton▪ Jenkins Drs Owen and Collins and afterwards Alsop Howe Cole  c  chiefly distinguished themselves at these meetingsIn the parliament Charles and Shaftsbury his chancellor extolled this indulgence But the Commons having become less tractable than their predecessors held it as destructive to the liberties of the kingdom None were more zealous against it than the dissenters Alderman Love a member from the city of London declared that notwithstanding all that they had suffered for the twelve preceding years he and all his  fellow Protestant dissenters would rather want their own rightful liberties than have them in a way destructive of the liberties of the nation and of the Protestant cause Charles was therefore obliged to part with his  indulgence  and to call in the licences which he had given for meetinghouses The Commons perhaps affected by Love's generosity brought in a Bill for relieving Protestant dissenters from the penalties of not coming to church and of holding conventicles But by the influence of the court and bishops it miscarried  Charles having refused to dismiss the Papists whom he had openly admitted to places of power and trust the Parliament in enacted That none under the penalty of five hundred pounds should hold any office of profit or trust unless they had sworn the oaths of allegiance and supremacyand had received the Lord's supper in the manner of the English church and solemnly renounced the doctrine of transubstantiation This act requiring the reception of the Lord's supper before the minister church wardens and other two credible witnesses as a condition of admission to civil offices under the crown still remains in force to the dishonour of Christ and reproach of religion By the above act the Cabal was dissolved and Shaftsbury and Buckingham became advocates for the liberties of the kingdom Provoked with this exclusion of Papists from places of power and trust Charles and his courtiers laboured to increase the severities against the dissenters Their clergy were imprisoned plundered and ruined Sheldon by another circular letter quickened their persecution But the Judges were become more mild and shunned the informers who had rendered themselves odious Multitudes of lay conformists pitied their neighbours when they saw them imprisoned and spoiled for nothing but a scrupulous conscience or an holy life In vain the court attempted an act of parliament requiring That every voter in the election of members of parliament and all  members of it or of the privy council should swear That it is unlawful upon any pretence whatsoever to take up arms against the king or those commissioned by him and that they should never endeavour any alteration of either church or state Quite infuriated with the loss of this arbitrary and enslaving bill the courtiers to their utmost opposed all toleration of the dissenters and a new encouraged the infamous informers and inflamed the cruel persecution Sir Roger L' Estrange a most profligate scoundrel was hired to expose them from the Press and to encourage the severest treatment of them as a people who had ruined the late king and done every thing horrid While the lower clergy retailed his calumnious abuse from their pulpits the bishops opposed every motion for accommodation of differences with the Puritans and applied to his majesty for a more vigorous prosecution of the penal laws against them  In a Popish plot for rendering Charles and his successors absolute monarchs and for introduction of the Popish religion broke out The parliament committed five Popish Lords to the Tower issued forth a proclamation against all Papists and requested the king to remove James duke of York his brother who had for several years professed himself a Papist from his person and councils The court did all that in them lay to stiffle the evidence of this Popish plot and employed L' Estrange to represent it as ridiculous The patriots employed one Carr to publish weekly discoveries of the frauds and superstition of the church of Rome But he was quickly fined and his paper prohibited by the King's Bench Nevertheless the parliament by an act disqualified from a seat with them all such as refused to abjure the doctrine of transubstantiation and worship of saints To avert the odium from themselves the Papists pretended to discover a Presbyterian plot Dangerfield the principal manager having conveyed a number of seditious letters into one Marshal's house sent the officers to search for  prohibited goods who soon found the letters he had laid fair for their hand But they being proven counterfeits he confessed that the Popish Lords in the Tower and others had hired him to forge them  In the parliament attempted to exclude the duke of York from succeeding to the crown because he was a Papist Baffled in this they attempted a comprehension of the dissenters the Papists being now almost able to balance all the Protestants in the kingdom Baffled in this also they with no small opposition in the House of Lords repealed the statute of Elizabeth concerning the penalties of nonattendance upon established churches But the clerk of the crown by Charles' secret instructions withdrew this act when along with others it should have received the royal assentIn imitation of the court some conformist clergymen changed their wonted moderation into furious rage and persecution Instead of an IRENICUM Stillingfleet now published his  Mischief of separation  and highly condemned all the dissenters of the most criminal schism He was answered by Owen Baxter Alsop Howe and Barret Meanwhile it seems Charles hired FitzHarris an Irish Papist to forge a new Presbyterian plot He sent letters to the Peers who had protested for the exclusion of the duke of York from the crown reviling the king and his family as Papists and calling them to take up arms against him But the farce was discovered  In the parliament again attempted to exclude the duke of York from the throne But Charles dissolved them to prevent it and notwithstanding his solemn promise never called another The university of Cambridge and many others sent him flattering addresses in favours of arbitrary power and some pressed the vigorous execution of the penal laws against Protestant dissenters Hence they were now persecuted with uncommon fury Not a few of the established clergy in country places who could drink and swear as abandoned rakes were  made Justices of peace They readily judged in their own cause and fined such dissenters as absentted from their churches but a single day To speak against Popery was enough to make one suspected and reproached as a Puritan The very Quakers from whose hostilities no body was in danger were imprisoned and spoiled of their goods Most of the clergy extolled passive obedience to sovereigns let them act as wickedly and tyrannically as they could By their published decree the university of Oxford declared it  impious seditious scandalous damnable heretical blasphemous  and  infamous  to Christianity itself to maintain  That there is any original contract between the king and his subjects  or  That kings may be resisted when they subvert the constitution of the kingdom and become absolute tyrants  The imprudent talk of some persons in taverns or the like gave the courtiers an handle to pretend what they called the  Ryehouse plot  By witnesses bribed for the purpose the earl of Essex lord Russel Algernon Sidney Rumbold and Houblon were impeached as guilty Not content with the murdering of these innocent patriots the court made their own farce a reason of new cruelties against the dissenters Twenty young men at Newcastle were imprisoned a year for meeting together for private prayer and spiritual conference Meanwhile the clergymen published their three and twenty Cases against dissenters in order to persuade the world that all the severities used against them were just and reasonable The dissenters were shut out from their own vindication by the restriction of the Press More daring than some others Tho de Laune an Anabaptist schoolmaster when publicly challenged for an answer by Dr Calamy a furious conformist published his sensible  Plea for the nonconformists  and on that account was cast into prison where notwithstanding all he could do for relief he continued till he and his wife and two children perished of hunger and cold or the like  In Charles died not without strong suspicious of poison from Popish hands for the establishment of whose religion he was thought not sufficiently zealous and active James duke of York a bigotted Papist succeeded him and solemnly engaged to preserve the government of both church and state As if such a sovereign had been an inestimable blessing the conformists pulpits all over the nation rang with thanksgivings and all the counties sent up their fulsome addresses The university of Oxford in the most unlimited manner declared That it was impossible to move them from an unlimited subjection to all his commands His parliament procured to his liking by bribery and other too common arts settled two millions sterling yearly upon him that he might never be embarrassed for want of money as his brother and father had been and they besought his vigorous execution of the laws against the Protestant dissenters The persecution was revived and occasion was taken from Monmouth Charles' bastard soninlaw's invading the kingdom to make it more and more terrible The royal army in the West lived on the people at free quarter Colonel Kirk caused a number of prisoners without any trial to be hung up for diversion while he and his companions drank and danced beside the gibbets Jefferies now Chief Justice whose savage temper had been sufficiently manifested was appointed judge in the Western circuit Alway drunk or in a fury he raged among the poor people as an absolute infernal By repeated confinements he forced juries to bring in people  guilsy  whether they had proof or believed them guilty or not He persuaded many of the prisoners to plead guilty in hopes of a pardon and then ordered them to be executed immediately without having a moment for recommending their souls to God About six hundred were hanged and the quarters of two or three hundred were fixed on trees and gibbets by the way sides to the great annoyance of travellers He sold a multitude of pardons  from the rate of ten to fourteen thousand guineas a piece By such methods some dissenters were forced into the church and multitudes fled to Holland or America and Spademan Rastric Burroughs Scoffin Quipp and other conforming clergymen were by the power of conscientious convictions forced from the church to join the persecuted dissenters  Meanwhile the Popish party mightily increased Multitudes of Jesuits and regular priests were invited from abroad Jesuitical seminaries of learning were erected in London and in the country Masschapels were erected in almost every considerable town Four Popish bishops were consecrated in the royal chapel Multitudes of tracts for seducing people to Popery were published Multitudes frequented the Popish chapels as that and zeal for James' absolute power were the sole road to preferments All the subjects were prohibited to speak disrespectfully of his majesty's religion At last some conformists opened their eyes and began to preach against Popery James prohibited the inferior clergy to touch upon controverted points of religion Hereupon Drs Tillotson Stillingfleet Tennison Patrick Wake Whitby Sharp Atterbury and others began to copy the example which the dissenters had set them some years before in their  morning exercises  and published a number of sensible discourses against the principal corruptions of Popery It seems that Richard Baxter and some other nonconformists offered to assist them in writing on these points But their productions were not allowed to be printed The established clergy did not appear fond of their help nor had they proper access to the books necessary for such work nor would it have been prudent to have provoked James beyond what they had done in refusing to concur in the repeal of the  Test Act  Provoked with the conformists opposition to his religion James declared against the cruelty of  the church of England And encouraged by the Judges who interpreted the laws he by his absolute dispensing power granted an  indulgence  to the dissenters courted their affection and encouraged them to set up their conventicles They improved this opportunity of preaching the gospel but had no good opinion of his end in granting it  After a constant persecution of twenty six years the extremity of the Puritans sufferings now came to an end About sixty thousand had suffered much on religious accounts Five if not rather about ten thousand had perished in prisons Of the Quakers alone three hundred and fifty died in jail and about fourteen hundred were now released Multitudes had retired to America Holland  c  nevertheless the number of remaining dissenters was much the same as at the beginning of the persecution Their firmness and constancy in sufferings convinced the world that they were not governed by humour but by conscience Their sermons being plain and practical had no small success their morals were remarkably answerable to the commandments of Christ they had carefully trained up their children their own way and laboured to impress their minds with a sense of religion They studied to keep up a succession of faithful ministers These things together with the persecuting rage and licentious behaviour of the conformists made the numbers of Puritans continue amidst all their temporal discouragements  James and his priests being thoroughly enraged against their conformist opposers he appointed commissioners all over the kingdom to enquire into the  oss sustained by the dissenters that their persecutors might be obliged to refund it The informers judges and many others laid their account with immediate ruin But the Puritans generally concealed their injuries when it was in their power to have them revenged and their loss refunded By the advice of chancellor Jesseries and contrary to a standing  law of and to James' own subjection to the Pope a new  High Commission  was erected to visit the nation reform the disorders of the church and punish clerical offenders with suspension deprivation excommunication  c  Sancroft archbishop of Canterbury was afraid to act in this terrible work But the bishops of Durham and Rochester Jefferies himself the earl of Sunderland Herbert and Wright chief Justices and Fenner recorder of London some of them professed Papists were not so squeamish The universities of Cambridge and Oxford were commanded to fill up their vacancies with scandalous Popish fellows and governors but they obstinately refused  By his absolute power James now published a  declaration  of his intentions or rather a  promise  to protect the church of England as by law established and to grant a toleration in religion to all his subjects and to abolish all penal laws against dissentersor imposition of oaths or tests upon such as held public employments The Baptists Quakers Independents and Presbyterians thanked him for his favour but promised no absolute obedience Notwithstanding the presence of two courtiers most of the Presbyterian clergy at their general meeting seemed willing rather to forfeit their liberty granted than declare for his majesty's power Sir James Shorter mayor of London declined his freedom from the Test and from conformity to the English church which displeased the king Lobb an Independent minister Penn the Quaker and some few other dissenters complied not a little with James and his courtiers measures but the bulk of the dissenters stood off and notwithstanding all that the court could do refused to assist in the destruction of those that had so long persecuted them These persecutors now implored their assistance and promised a redress of their grievances as soon as their common danger from Popery should blow over Some of the bishops waited upon the leaders of the dissenting clergy and besought  them to use their influence with their party to stand aloof from the court in doing which they might assuredly expect redress of their burdens as soon as possible The Marquis of Halifax by advice of the church dignitaries represented to the dissenters That they had no ground to trust the Papists and that they ought not to prosecute their resentment at the expence of the public safety and that they might see how the conformists resentment had brought themselves to the brink of ruin About twenty thousand copies of this letter were dispersed and had a very good effect  The rupture between James and the church of England having become quite open and manifest both parties prepared for their own defence By turning out magistrates and placing others in their room according to the powers claimed by him in the new charters and by displacing such officers in the kingdom as disliked his absolute power and by a tour through the country to ingratiate himself with his people James laboured to procure a parliament for repealing the penal statutes concerning religion Mild methods not succeeding to his wish he abandoned himself to the direction of his furious Popish priests made father Petre one of them his prime minister intending to make him archbishop of York and a cardinal of the Holy Conclave The earl of Castlemain was dispatched ambassador to Rome and the Pope's nuncio received a solemn audience at Windsor notwithstanding the law of Henry VIII still made it treason to correspond with his Holiness Parker bishop of Oxford was employed to publish reasons of abrogating the Test In his performance he said what he could to excuse transubstantiation and to clear the Papists from the charge of idolatry But a smart reply by Dr Burnet sunk the reputation of Parker In Ireland every thing was modelled for an immediate introduction of Popery In England James was busy at the like work Protestant officers were turned out  of the army Portsmouth and Hull the principal ports of the kingdom were committed to Papists Irish Papists came over in multitudes Some regiments being formed only of Papists and scarcely a troop or company without some placed in them by order from court the army was brought to Blackheath to awe the city of London and the parliament  There being still danger from a Protestant successor as Mary his eldest daughter had been married to William prince of Orange son of Mary daughter of Charles I James wrote her a letter for persuading her to embrace his Popish religion and employed one James Stewart a Scotch lawyer to cause Fagel William's principal confident labour to promote his conversion to Popery or at least his approbation of the repeal of the penal laws against it William and Mary's answers giving James no ground to expect their conversion he resolved to have a new heir to his crown by his long barren queen The Jesuits pretences that she obtained this child by a vow to the virgin Mary of Loretto and their predictions that it would be a princetogether with the total neglect of the requisite proofs of the queen's pregnancy and delivery and many other suspicious circumstances made most of the Protestants in the nation believe it an imposture Encouraged by the hopes of an unborn successor James in April by his absolute power over all laws published his  second declaration  for liberty of conscience and appointed the bishops to cause it to be read from every pulpit during the time of divine worship Crew of Durham Barlow of Lincoln Cartwright of Chester Wood of Litchfield Walters of St David's Sprat of Rochester Parker of Oxford and Herbert of Hereford complied and all but Herbert returned their fulsom addresses of thanks to James Eighteen bishops and the chiefs of their clergy refused to publish it so that it was  ead in no more than about churches seven of them in London Sancroft of Canterbury Loyd of St Asaph Ken of Bath and Wells Turner of Ely Lake of Chichester  White of Peterborough and Trelawney of Bristol in an address to James attempted to justify their not publishing his Declaration as they could not but think the  dispensing  power contrary to the laws of the land For their presumption they were sent to the Tower which indeed they richly deserved on another account as they had for twentyseven years laboured to establish kings arbitrary power and passive obedience to it till it came to be turned against themselves Upon the th of June after a trial of ten hours these bishops to James' inexpressible vexation but to the joy of the city and part of the army were acquitted  Finding that Mary his princess was now excluded from the British crown by an heir whose royal birth was at best extremely doubtful William began to listen more attentively to the many invitations he received from England beseeching him to come over and deliver the nation from Popery and slavery Lewis XIV of France informed James of his soninlaw's intention to invade his kingdom and offered him fifteen thousand troops or more if necessary to withstand him But the earl of Sunderland who had been lately converted to Popery persuaded him not to accept of these offered troops as it would make all the Protestants believe that he intended an overthrow of their religion and liberties Persuaded of William's intentions to invade his kingdom James to regain the favour of his Protestant subjects issued forth warrants for calling a parliamentby advice of the bishops took off the suspension of the bishop of London which had been inflicted for his refusing to suspend Dr Sharp for preaching against Popery before he had tried himdissolved the ecclesiastical commission restored the charter of London and the fellows of Magdalen college at Oxford and renounced several other illegal practices But he no sooner heard that William's sleet was dispersed by a storm than he stopt his redressing of grievances  UPON Nov st William again put to sea with fourteen thousand men and on the th landed at Torbay in the south of England the wind having almost miraculously favoured him and restrained James' fleet He published a  Declaration  in which he enumerated the grievances of the nation relative to religion and liberty and the fruitless attempts which had been made to have them redressedand protested that his intention in his expedition was to procure a free parliament in which these grievances might be redressed and an agreement established between the church of England and the Protestant dissentersFinding by this declaration that William had been invited by not only nobles and others but also by a number of the bishops and that they refused to declare their detestation of his invasion James placed all his hopes in his army which he endeavoured to strengthen from Scotland and especially from Ireland in so much that many in Britain were afraid of a new Popish massacre This fright being over the London mob pulled down the Popish chapels Father Petre with shoals of Jesuits and priests who had flocked about the court fled out of the kingdom Several of James' ministers of arbitrary power left him and concealed themselves Jefferies was apprehended in a sailor's habit and would have been torn to pieces by the mob had not a strong guard escorted him to the Tower where he died before he came to his trial When William came to Exeter many of the nobility signed an association in which they promised to assist him in the pursuance of his declaration and to revenge whatever attempt should be made on his person Finding that so many of his nobles and part of his army had gone over to his soninlaw that Anne his younger daughter and her husband prince George of Denmark had left him and that the university of Oxford archbishop Sancroft and seven or eight other bishops had signed the above mentioned associationJames after not a  little perplexity contempt and abuse followed his queen into France When William came to London many of the established clergy and about ninety dissenters in a body presented their congratulatory addresses to him and were graciously received When he and Mary his consort were enthroned the dissenters presented an address to each of them which were favourably accepted And indeed during their whole reign the dissenters were their most hearty and steady friends  Many of the clerical conformists now behaved in a most shocking manner After they had long preached up the unlimited power of the king and encouraged the imposition of oaths acknowledging it they plainly shewed that they regarded it only so far as it was exercised to support themselves After they had seduced James into his extravagancies they left him to perish in his ruins After they had solemnly engaged to support William they almost constantly laboured to compass the ruin of his person and government Sancroft of Canterbury Loyd of Norwich Turner of Ely Frampton of Gloucester Thomas of Worcester Lake of Chichester and White of Peterborough refused to swear allegiance to him Many who did swear it by their distinction between a king  de facto  and one  de jure  plainly manifested that they submitted to William and Mary as mere usurpers whom they thought it their duty to pull down if ever they could No sooner was their danger from the Papists over than they cast all their kind promises to dissenters at their heels and appeared as ready to persecute them as ever The eight bishops above mentioned pretended to move for a comprehension of some dissenters and for a toleraon of the rest and meanwhile instigated their friends to oppose it and to represent the promoters of it as enemies to the church The bigotted clergy threatened their moderate brethren with a new separation if any important mitigation of the terms of communion were allowed to the dissenters and by that  means deterred them from correcting the Book of common prayer lest these zealots by adhering to the old form of it should draw over the body of the nation to their side  When king William came to his first parliament he recommended the exclusion of Papists from all places of power or trust and the unhampered admission of all his Protestant subjects Some members moved that the receiving of the Lord's supper at least in the manner of the established church should not be held a necessary qualification for a civil office but the contrary was carried The dispensing with  kneeling  at the Lord's supper or  crossing  in baptism and an allowance for persons to explain  assent  and  consent  in their subscription of the  Thirtynine articles  were refused in the House of LordsAn act of  toleration  for all Protestants except Socinians by which they were exempted from the penalties of nonconformity providing they take the oaths to the government and subscribe the doctrinal articles of the English church was got carried but with great difficulty  During the dependence of the above acts in parliament a motion was made in the House of Lords for a comprehension of the moderate dissenters and a removal of these things at which they principally scrupled Some moved that as under Henry VIII and Edward VI a mixed committee of clergymen and laymen should prepare the draught of corrections and terms of agreement This motion was rejected by a small majority Burnet laments that he opposed it for fear of offending the established clergy By the advice of Dr Tillotson king William referred it to a Synod of clergymen that their body might the more readily receive it and the Papists have less handle of objecting against it Lamplugh archbishop of York Loyd Sprat Burnet and six other bishopsStillingfleet Tillotson Sharp Beveridge Scot Grove Patrick Kidder Tennison Fowler and ten other divines were appointed to  meet and prepare such alterations of the  liturgy  and  canons  and to frame overtures for the reformation of the ecclesiastical courtsand to consider every other like matter which might tend to the peace and welfare of the church Bishops Mew and Sprat and two divines withdrew that they might have no hand in relieving the dissenters Some who remained pled That making of alterations upon the constitutions of the church for gratifying an obstinate and peevish party would but render them more insolent would occasion a rent in the church and make people disesteem the liturgy which needed correction Nevertheless the committee finished their work and agreed That certain parts of canonical scripture be read in place of the apocryphal lessons and that the Athanasian creed might be omitted and that ascribed to the apostles used instead of it They drew up new collects more agreeable to the epistles and gospels Kidder formed a new version of the Psalms from the Hebrew They substituted more plain and safe expressions instead of those which had been excepted against in the liturgy They agreed That the singing of God's praise by musical instruments in cathedrals be laid aside that legendary saints days should be omitted in the Calendar and not observed that the use of the  cross  in baptism and of  godfathers  and  godmothers  be left to the option of parents that  kneeling  in the Lord's supper be left indifferent that the use of the  surplice  be left indifferent and at the discretion of the bishop of the diocese that the reordination of such as have been ordained by presbyters be only conditional that the name of  priest  be changed into that of  minister  c c These alterations would have probably brought in three fourths of the dissenters to the established church But the bulk of the clergy relished no such condescensions While the committee were employed in their work many raised a terrible outcry That king William and his agents intended to pull down Episcopacy and set up Presbytery The universities  of Oxford and Cambridge furiously declared themselves against all alterations and that such as promoted them were undoubted enemies to the church  Care was taken to appoint such members for the convocation as would so judge of the work of the committee as to put an end to all attempts of alterations When they met K William desired them to consider what he had to lay before them with due and impartial zeal for the welfare of the church But the lower House at the first resolved to enter on no debate relative to the Book of common prayer and Constitutions of their church They had scarcely temper enough to thank his majesty for his promised protection of them and their church Nor could the bishops bring them to acknowledge any Christian fellowship with the Protestant churches abroad as had been done in the address of the upper House Finding the Lower House behave in this furious manner William dissolved their meeting and since they were in no temper to do good he by proroguing their assemblies restrained them from doing any hurt for ten years to come The settlement of Presbytery in Scotland was improved by these mad zealots as an handle for calumniating his majesty and opposing all condescension toward the dissenters  Terrible was now the contention between the Episcopalian clergy that took the oaths of  allegiance  and  supremacy  to K William and such as did not The  Nonjurants  represented their opponents as men who had trampled on their consciences for the sake of prefermentand pretended That the imposition of the oath warranted them to separate from their brethren that they had their spiritual authority from Christ and could not be deprived of it by the civil powersand so were still bound to take care of the souls of their people The  Jurants  replied That they were schismatics in separating from the church that though the state had deprived them of their livings they ought not to revenge it upon the church in a schismatical withdrawment from her  communion and that magistrates may lawfully deprive clergymen of their extrinsical power of exercising their ministry All along from the reformation and especially for near years past the Episcopalian clergy had maintained the power of princes in ecclesiastical causes and an unlimited passive obedience to them But now the High Church party refused to admit of his majesty's power in spiritual causes and both they and the Williamites gave up with their doctrine of passive obedience  Having now lost hopes of access to the established church the bulk of the Presbyterians and Independents formed a plan of concord between themselves bearing That all who are united to Christ are members of his catholic invisible church and all visible believers and their children members of the visible that societies of visible believers who under Christ statedly join together for communion in all the ordinances of the gospel are particular churches that none ought to be admitted as members to all sealing ordinances but such as know and believe the fundamental truths of the gospel and are of blameless lives marked with visible godliness and honesty that a competent number of visible saints become the subjects of stated church fellowship upon their agreement to walk together according to gospel rules that though parochial churches are not of divine institution yet for edification the members of a particular church ought to live as contiguously as possible that every particular church hath a right to choose their own pastors and being furnished with them hath authority from Christ for the exercise of government and dispensation of ordinances within itself that in administrating church power it belongs to officers to rule and to the brotherhood to consent that all Christians as they have opportunity ought to join and stedfastly continue in communion with some particular church that the ministerial office is appointed by Jesus Christ for the gathering edification and government of his church  till the end of the world that such as are called or admitted to the ministerial office ought to be marked with proper gifts grace and holy conversation that in ordinary cases none ought to be ordained pastors but in relation to some particular church that it is proper that the pastors of neighbouring congregations be consulted in the calling of ministers and assist at their ordination that it is proper that the gifts of candidates for preaching the gospel be tried by pastors and that they be sent forth with solemn approbation and prayer that in every church admonitions and excommunications of scandalous persons ought to have place that in order to promote the communion of churches all the members ought to walk Christianly towards one anotherno church ought to usurp authority over one another nor to decoy members from another or to blame the proceedings of another till it hath had an opportunity of defending itselfand every one ought readily to give account of its procedure in order to prevent offence that deacons who take care of the poor are appointed by Christ that no breach ought to be made with respect to the institution of ruling elders that Synods ought to be held at least for consultation about church affairs and their decisions to be received with reverence and none to dissent from them without apparent ground from the word of God that all men ought to pray for obey and support civil magistrates  They agreed pretty well in condemning the expressions of Davis of Rothwel sundry of which bordered on Antinomianism or Anabaptism but soon fell into a terrible flame of contention relative to some of the distinguished truths of the gospel For almost forty years preceding Richard Baxter had been attempting to form a medley of Calvinistical and Arminian doctrines particularly concerning our redemption by Christ and justification before God and had been refuted by Dr Owen Crandon Brown and many others Nevertheless his fame of piety  and penetration had decoyed most of the English Presbyterians to his side In the sermons of the eminently pious Dr Crisp who had flourished about fifty years before and had been blamed for approaching too near Antinomianism were republished by his son Several ministers attested that they believed the additional sermons to be genuine This attestation was pretended to be a countenancing of their contents Mr Williams published his  Gospel truth stated and vindicated  in which he attempted to refute several positions laid down by Dr Crisp As he steered a middle course betwixt Baxterianism and Calvinism or rather refined upon Baxter it was not difficult to procure a solemn approbation of his book from clergymen of his acquaintance But it was refuted with great warmth by Isaac Chauncey in his  Neonomianism unmasked  Robert Trail also published a letter in vindication of the Protestant doctrine of justification through the imputed righteousness of Christ alone and of the practisers and professors of it from the unjust charge of Antinomianism  Great pains were taken by some to heal this unhappy breach which hindered the success of the gospel and mightily pleased the conformist enemies of both parties But by mutual reproaches it was more and more widened A breach was made in the lecture at  Pinner's Hall  Nothing less than the exclusion of Williams could satisfy his opponents Bates Howe and Alsop who were all inclined to his sentiments went off with him Mead and T Cole remained and had four others added in place of those that went off Mather Lobb Goodwin and others appeared in opposition to Williams' scheme of the gospel being a  new law  and his denial of a  legal change of person  between the elect and Christ as their surety Lobb appealed to Stillingfleet now bishop of Worcester and to Dr John Edwards both of whom favoured Dr Williams' scheme After the two parties by hot debates of several years continuance had rendered themselves  a reproach they in some sort referred their differences to Herman Witsius a Dutch professor of divinity To compose them he published his  Animadversiones Irenicae  in which he with great candour meekness and precision pointed out the truth and reproved the illguarded expressions of them that held it He shewed That all the sins of elect men being laid upon borne and satisfied for by Christ as their surety there behoved to be an exchange of persons between him and them in lawreckoning that though Christ bore the sins of his people not not only during his last sufferings but in his whole state of humiliation he ought not to be represented as a  sinner blasphemer adulterer  c or as abominable to and abdicated by his Father that tho' Christ absolutely and unconditionally purchased eternal redemption for all his elect yet his righteousness is not imputed to their persons till the moment of their regeneration and spiritual unition to him that though Christ and his elect were legally united together from all eternity that their sins might be laid on him and satisfaction demanded from him in the fulness of time yet their mystical union is not begun till he apprehend them by his Spirit nor compleated till they receive him by faith that Christ's holiness of nature and life under the law as well as his satisfactory sufferings are imputed by God to all believers which constitute them perfectly holy and righteous in lawreckoning before him as their infinitely exact Judge that men's justification before God in no respect depends upon any kind of works of theirs nor on faith which is and necessarily produceth good works as a work as a condition or disposing cause but merely as an instrument of receiving Christ and his righteousness and justification thro' it that though many true believers have not any bold confidence that Christ and his salvation are theirs in possession yet faith in itself is a most firm persuasion of one's own particular right to Christ and all his saving benefits and this persuasion is weak  or strong as faith itself is in the heart that repentance in the root of it being coeval with the habit of faith may be said to precede actual pardon of sin as well as faith that though all the sins of believers past present and to come be fully and irrevocably pardoned in their justification on account of which God as a legal judge can see no sin in them in order to condemnation yet as an omniscient and holy Father he sees much sin in them to be highly displeased with them and which exceedingly hurts and defiles themand therefore they ought to be burdened with confess and mourn over it and pray for the pardon of it that though Christ's suretyrighteousness be the only proper condition of the covenant of grace yet the Lord hath appointed faith to be the mean of his elect's entrance into the actual enjoyment of the blessing of it that though our graces and good works are of no avail as the condition of our justification before God nay as dwelling in our sinful nature and proceeding from us are but as loss dung and filthy rags before him as a judge yet as proceeding from the Holy Ghost and accepted through Christ they are of great use as a preparation for heaven and as means of averting God's judgments and drawing his delights and benefits on us as his friends and children in Christ that the law of God as a covenant of works and as a Rule of life and the gospel particularly as  strictly taken  ought to be carefully preached in their proper connexions with each other and that though the beginning of our spiritual life is produced by the gospel  strictly taken  conveying God's grace into our heart the progress and increase of it is produced both by the gospel and by the law as a rule of life  These contentions had more abundantly exposed the dissenters concerned to the ridicule of their conformist neighbours had they not been as hotly engaged among themselves Mr Howe had published a letter pleading with both conformists and nonconformists that they would think of and behave  Christianly and charitably towaad each other as the points in which they differed were of small importance in respect of those in which they agreed But whatever good effect this might have upon some dissenters it had none upon most of the conformists Stillingfleet and others exceedingly grudged at the late toleration To allay their heats Locke so well known in the learned world at different times published his  Letters on toleration  in which amidst not a few loose hints he hath exhausted his subject and shewed that force is an improper mean of conviction and that men ought not to be compelled by it into the faith profession and practice of religion  After patient waiting for several years the sees of the Nonjurant deprived bishops were filled up in and the rather as Turner of Ely had been accused of having a hand in a conspiracy against king William John Tillotson was made archbishop of Canterbury Ed Fowler bishop of Gloucester Sam Patrick of Ely J More of Norwich Rich Kidder of Bath and Wells Rich Cumberland of Peterborough Robert Grove of Chichester and Edward Stillingfleet of Worcester Tillotson died about three years after greatly lamented by all the friends of ingenuity charity and moderation and was succeeded by Tennison Many of the inferior clergy refused to hold communion with these new bishops but adhered to the old and thus formed a church of Nonjurors They maintained That James still continued the only lawful king of Britain that all such as acknowledged another were by the d canon  ipso facto  excommunicated that the deprivation of bishops by civil authority is utterly invalid and ought not to be regarded that the authority of the church of England and consequently the church itself resides in the Nonjurors and their successors who have stedfastly adhered to her true constitutions and that all that depart from them or join the new schismatical bishops are schismatics and all such clergy as do so forfeit their office and cannot dispense the  ordinances of God to any edification Hicks Kettlewell and Lesly were principal supporters of this scheme Hellier and others but especially Hoadly afterward bishop of Winchester opposed them  As king William had long restrained the convocation from meeting and transacting business at the same time with the parliament a Remonstrance was published in bearing That convocations were now as necessary as ever they had been in the Christian church that William had sworn to maintain the rights of the English church that the convocation ought to be called whenever the parliament sits that they are a spiritual parliament consisting of an Upper and Lower Houseand have power to proceed against such as are guilty of heresy schism or any other spiritual offences without restriction by any act of parliament and that their  canons  are binding if agreeable to common sense his majesty's prerogative and the laws of the land This kindled a new controversy which was not soon if ever adjusted Dr Wake afterward archbishop of Canterbury in several tracts laboured to prove the power of Christian princes over ecclesiastical Synods and was answered by Hill and Atterbury in his  Rights powers and privileges of an English convocation stated and vindicated  who in their turn were answered by Kennet Burnet  c  The contests of the dissenters concerning the doctrines of the gospel and of the Episcopalians concerning church government were not finished when the convocation sat down in A D Bent upon asserting their own independency of the Upper the Lower House refused to adjourn when required by the archbishop Without any allowance from the king they collected and read several books and marked their errors Some members complained with great warmth of Burnet's exposition of the  Thirtynine articles  They intended to have strengthened the church with additional  canons  But as his majesty had given them no licence to proceed to business  the archbishop prorogued their meeting till May after they had sitten some months to no purpose A new contest ensued Whether the Lower House of convocation have power to adjourn or continue themselves as they please Many tracts relative to this point were published The Upper House laboured by all the expedients they could devise to have peace and harmony with the Lower till at last his majesty's death in March for a time hushed their debate  ANNE had scarcely succeeded him when the Presbyterian Independent and Baptist dissenters presented her with a joint address Their conforming enemies already hoped to revive their former oppression Before this Clarkson had published his  Account of the primitive bishops and liturgies  King his  Constitution of the primitive church  James Owen his  Plea for the validity of Presbyterian ordination  and Tong his  Vindication of the dissenters  none of which pleased the Episcopalian bigots Sir Humphrey Edwin a dissenting mayor of London about five years before had carried the  regalia  or badges of his office to the meeting at  Pinner's Hall  Some tracts had been published for and against the occasional conformity of dissenters bearing public office Having got rid of king William whom they heartily hated and got a queen of their own temper their enemies resolved to hamper their toleration with additional restrictions and conditions and to exclude them from all public office unless they fully and constantly conformed to the church  No sooner had the parliament met than the Commons appeared chiefly bent for carrying a Bill for the exclusion of all occasional conformists from public offices under the crown and bearing That whosoever after taking of the sacramental Test for offices of trust or magistracy in corporations frequented any meeting of dissenters for the public worship o  God should pay a fine of pounds sterling and  five pounds more for every day he retained his office after he had been at any such meeting As the Lords would not agree to it it was dropt In the Commons altered their Bill a little but the Lords again rejected it In the Commons brought it in a third time and many of them attempted to tack it to a money bill that the one might not be got rejected without the other But this miscarried and the Lords refused the Bill a second reading None opposed it more earnestly than bishop Burnet and his moderate Episcopal brethren  This Bill occasioned a prodigious number of publications for and against occasional conformity The enemies of the dissenters pled That if they could occasionally conform for the sake of an office their separation was not matter of conscience with them but a real schism that if occasional conformity was lawful constant conformity must be so likewise and that either their occasional conformity or their stated nonconformity must be hypocritical The dissenters and other friends of occasional conformity pled That though they thought it duty to maintain stated communion with such as they reckoned wrongfully excluded from the national churchas a testimony against such persecutionwith such as administered Christ's ordinances with least mixture of human inventionswith such as asserted the liberty of Christians from human impositions in the worship of God with such as denied admission of persons ignorant or scandalous to the seals of his covenantwith such whose principles most admitted of Christian charityand in whose administrations their souls experienced most spiritual edificationYet they reckoned occasional conformity lawful that therein they might imitate the practice of John Baptist and of Jesus Christ and his apostles that they might shew their charity and regard to those of different sentiments and their readiness to join the established church if they had but a proper opportunity afforded them After both parties had written themselves  out of breath an act against the admission of occasional conformists to any places of power and trust passed in  Instigated by bishop Burnet Anne in remitted the arrears of the tithes to the poor clergy and offered to allot her whole share of the first fruits and tithes for that end The parliament passed an act for alienation of this branch of the revenue for said end and for forming a corporation to see to the application of it accordingly and they repealed the statute of  Mortmain  so far as to allow persons to dispone what they pleased for the augmentation of benefices This kindness did not reconcile the clergy to Burnet whom they had long so heartily hated The Lower House of convocation still contended with their superiors in the Upper They besought her majesty to protect them and take the point of debate between them into her own hand for decision In the Upper House having drawn up an address of thanks to her for her affectionate care of the church which the parliament had lately declared to be in no danger the Lower One without offering any reason refused to concur in it and formed one of their own in a very different strain which was rejected by the archbishop In consequence of this the address was dropt and all communication between the two houses shut up The queen by a letter signified to the archbishop That she resolved to maintain her supremacy and the due subordination of presbyters to bishops and hoped that he and his suffragans would act accordinglyin doing which they might expect her protection and she appointed him to impart this declaration to the bishops and clergy and to prorogue the convocation to such time as should appear most convenient  In the parliament readily agreed to make the perpetual security of the church of England a  fundamental article  of the incorporating union with the Scots But the Lower House of convocation still continued to wrangle with their superiors  They resolved to remonstrate to the Commons against the union as dangerous to their church Apprized of their intentions her majesty required the archbishop to prorogue them for three weeksbefore the expiration of which the act for the union had passed in parliament They remonstrated to the Upper House against the prorogation and pretended that the convocation had never been prorogued during the sitting of parliament But from the records it appeared that on several occasions it had been prorogued while the parliament sat and in some instances had sat after the parliament had been dissolved Informed of their behaviour the queen wrote to the archbishop that she looked on them as invading her supremacy and that if they attempted any such thing for the future she would take care to punish the offenders About the same time the French Protestants prosecuted Elias Marion John Cavalier and Durand Fage before Compton bishop of London They were declared impostors Notwithstanding this sentence was confirmed by the bishops these French prophets or rather enthusiasts held their assemblies in London under the countenance of Sir Richard Bulkley and John Lacyreviled the established clergyand denounced the judgments of God against London and the whole British nation The French Protestants therefore again prosecuted them and each of them was sined in twenty marks and condemned to stand twice on a scaffold with papers on their breast exhibiting their offence  For twenty years multitudes of the English conformists had continued reviling the Revolution K William had scarcely expired when his character and conduct were most rudely abused So loud were the outcries of the church being in danger especially by those that lived more like brutes or devils than like Christians that the parliament in had been obliged to take this matter into consideration and had resolved That the church was in a flourishing  condition and that whoever attempted to persuade people that she was in danger should be held an enemy to the queen church and kingdom Notwithstanding all this Dr H Sacheverel in published two sermons in which he pretended that the necessary means of bringing about the Revolution were odious and unjustifiable that the act tolerating Protestant dissenters was unreasonable and unwarrantable that the established church of England was in great danger under her majesty's administration that the present administration of both church and state tended to destroy their constitution The Commons declared his sermons scandalous and seditious libels and impeached himself of high crimes and misdemeanors before the Lords The Commons too warm prosecution of him disgusted many that were of moderate principles The Tories pretended that the Whigs had formed a design to pull down the church and by this prosecution meant to try their strength in the parliament before they attempted their principal object These reports were too readily credited and spread by many of the clergy in order to inflame their people in favour of Sacheverel During his trial of three weeks continuance her majesty every day attended in the House though not in her royal appearances and crowds of people attended him to and from it and pressed to kiss his hand as if he had been some famous Confessor They beset the queen's chariot and cried That they hoped she was for Dr Sacheverel After his council had finished their defence he in a speech solemnly justified his intentions toward her majesty and government respectfully mentioned the Revolution and Protestant succession to the crown but maintained the doctrine of passive obedience to sovereigns as a maxim of the English church As Anne secretly favoured his cause her chaplains encouraged and extolled him as the champion of the church After much virulent altercation he was found guilty condemned to forbear preaching for three years and  his sermons to be publicly burnt by the hangman of London His friends considered the lenity of his sentence as a proof of their victory over his opponentsBeing presented to a living in North Wales he went thither with all the pomp and magnificence of a prince was received by the university of Oxford and the magistrates of several towns in his way in much the same manner as if a king and was often attended by about a thousand horse and nothing was heard but the cry of  The church and Dr Sacheverel  No sooner was his sentence expired in than the new House of Commons called him to preach before them and the queen presented him to the rich benefice of St Andrews London  Q Anne having turned out all her Whig ministers except the duke of Marlborough and dissolved her Whiggish parliament great care was taken to provide members to her taste for the next Such was the enthusiastical zeal for Dr Sacheverel that few were returned members but such as had distinguished themselves in opposition to the Whig administration Being met in they appointed fifty new churches to be built in London and excluded the dissenters from all civil offices or places of power and trust unless they became constant conformists The Lower House of convocation chose Dr Atterbury a furious Tory for their prolocutor and director while the queen marked her contempt of the bishops many of whom were too Whiggish for her new schemes of introducing a Popish pretender and overturning the liberties of both church and state She called the two houses of convocation to repress the attempts of profane persons against religion Atterbury drew up a representation of the state of religion ever since the Revolution containing most severe strictures upon the administration The bishops drew up one more moderate and proposed several regulations But the Houses could agree in almost nothing but the censuring of the Arian tenets vented by Whiston professor of mathematics in the university  of Cambridge But as they did not censure himself and the queen did not ratify their censure on his doctrine he continued publicly justifying and pleading that the  apostolical constitutions  were not only canonical scripture but in point of authority preferable to our Gospels To prevent the growth of schism the parliament in notwithstanding great opposition in both houses enacted That no dissenters should be allowed to teach in any school or academy But the queen dying on the very day on which the force of this statute commenced it became null and void  WHEN king George I came to the throne he marked an evident bias toward the Whigs who had so earnestly laboured for his advancement This provoked the Tories and even the populace against him Dangerous tumults were raised at Birmingham Bristol Chippenham Norwich Reading  c  The cry of the party was  Down with the Whigs and up with Sacheverel for ever  As the disputes relative to the Trinity which had been carried on about twenty years still increased his majesty required the bishops to see that nothing should be taught on that head but what is contained in the holy scripture and that no clergymen should meddle with the affairs of state The parliament in repealed the act against admission of occasional conformists into places of power or trust and the act prohibiting Protestant dissenters to teach in schools and academies Hoadly now bishop of Bangor distinguished himself in pleading for the repeal as he thought that no man ought to be deprived of civil privileges on account of his religious opinions As he had published a  Preservative from the principles and practices of the Nonjurors  and a sermon on the  nature of Christ's kingdom  the convocation appointed Drs Moss Sherlock Friend Sprat Canon and Bisse to examine them In their remarks they represented both as tending to subvert  all discipline and government in the church of Christ and to reduce it to anarchy and confusion and as impugning the royal supremacy in causes ecclesiastical and the power of the parliament to enforce obedience in religious matters by civil sanctions To restrain their heats his majesty appointed the archbishop to prorogue them Their publications afterward exposed them to the derision of moderate on lookers Snape and Sherlock were Hoadly's principal antagonists Never since hath the convocation been allowed to transact any business besides complimentary addresses to the king  The prosecution of Bisse for maintaining James to be lawful king of Britain and George an usurper and that for years past there had been neither king laws nor parliamentand his condemnation to stand on the pillory at Charingcross and at the Royal Exchange and to ly four years in prison and pay a fine of poundsthe parliament's admission of a solemn declaration from the Quakers instead of an oath and their condemnation of Atterbury bishop of Rochester in as a traitor to forfeit all his dignities and benefices and to banishment from the kingdom never to return under pain of deaththe attempt of the Quakers to get themselves freed from payment of ecclesiastical dues the intended naturalization of foreign Protestants and Jewsthe proposal of correcting the Book of common prayer the act for the public solemnization of marriage and the late attempt of Arians Socinians and others to have the subscription of the  Thirtynine articles  laid aside and the act for toleration of Papists are perhaps too late or too unimportant for a place in this abridgment It is more pleasant to observe that within these fifty years past the doctrines of the free grace of God reigning thro' the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ have by Hervey and others in the established church as well as by dissenters of different denominations been not a little revived  and successfully spread and are at present preached by hundreds though too often with a restriction of the gospel offer to  sensible  sinners  BRIEF SKETCH of the HISTORY of the CHURCH of IRELAND  PERHAPS by means of the Diocletian persecution in England and France the gospel had been introduced into Ireland in the th century About A D Palladius the deacon with twelve assistants being sent to form the believers there into an Episcopal church landed in Leinster and gained some proselytes and founded three churches But being rudely treated by the heathen inhabitants he retired to North Britain and ended his labours among the Picts Patrick a native of Bretagne in France or rather of Scotland near Glasgow was fired with zeal for the conversion of the savage Irish Being driven from Leinster after he had converted Cormac a prince and some others he fled to Ulster where Dichu a prince and the whole court of Tarah were converted to Christ It is said that he established a bishoprick at Clogher and an archbishoprick at Ardmach committing the first to M'Curtin and the last to the pious Binen and that soon afterwards he carried thirty holy men from Britain to Ireland and made them all bishops and that by his incessant labours of about sixty years continuance he spread the Christian religion through Leinster Ulster and Munster baptized twelve thousand converts and erected bishopricks to be sure not diocesan ones and died in A D About  seventy years after one Columb is represented as coming from the west of Scotland with no less than twenty bishops forty priests fifty devoted monks and thirty students in his train and pushing his way into the Convention of Estates which was sitting at Dromoeat Some writers represent Ireland in these times as famous for learning and piety but I could never find any proper evidence of it beside monkish devotions Congall Columba Aidan Finan Fursey Cuthbert Colman Clement Albin Claude John Erigena and the famous Cormac archbishop of Cashell and king of Munster who settled the psalter of Cashell are marked as their principal men of learning But I suspect the most of these were rather natives of Scotland  The almost perpetual wars of the many Irish kings one with anotherthe invasions of the country by the Picts and by the Welsh  c  in the th century rendered the nation miserable enough But the depredations and conquests of the Danes and Norwegians in the  ninth  and  tenth  centuries rendered their condition absolutely wretched These northern savages not only almost extirpated all appearances of Christianity but by fire and sword barbarously wasted and took possession of the best of the country Notwithstanding these heathens were at last driven out about A D there was but little regard paid to true Christianity when the English in consequence of a grant of the country by the Pope to king Henry II and an invitation by one of the seven kings a vile adulterer for his own protection conquered at least part of it and introduced their laws into it about A D During these two centuries Marian Scot Tigernach Melisa of Munster Gilbert of Limerick and Malachy the famed archbishop of Ardmach who is said to have emitted the  Prophecy of the Popes  were their principal learned men In order to render the Irish church liker to the English Henry after splendidly feasting the princes and other chiefs conveened a national Synod  at Cashell which enacted That none should marry their cousins or any other of their near kinsfolk that children should be catechized without the church door and be baptized in the fonts appointed for that end in the churches that the tithes of corn cattle and other increase and profits should be faithfully paid to the church that all church land and property should be free from all secular exactions and impositions that no clergyman however near of kin should pay any part of ERIC or composition for murder that Christians being sick shall make their testament before the priest and their neighbours dividing their moveables which remain after payment of all debts into three parts one for the widow another for the children and a third for the performance of the Will and if he have no children one half for the widow and the other for the performance of his testament that all that die in the catholic faith be brought to church and regularly buried and that all the parts of divine service be performed in the churches of Ireland in the same order and manner as in the church of England  Either at the college of Oxford or by means of some Waldenses that had fled into Ireland Richard archbishop of Ardmach appears to have obtained some discernment of the Popish abominations which occasioned to him not a little trouble from the Pope and his monks King Henry VIII having broken off from the Pope because he refused to dissolve his marriage with Catherine of Arragon introduced his English reformation into Ireland and required the clergy to abjure his Holiness' authority and acknowledge himself head of their church in his stead But except Brown archbishop of Dublin few of the dignified clergy heartily complied The primate of Ardmach not only hindered most of his suffragans and inferior clergy from submission but laid a curse on all the people that should own Henry's  supremacy  pretending that as the country had been characterized the  The holy Island  it belonged to none but  the bishop of Rome And indeed such was the brutish ignorance of both clergy and laity and their zealous attachment to the idolatries and superstitions of Rome that they needed no instigation The parliament meeting in A D confirmed his majesty's ecclesiastical as well as civil supremacy and asserted his power to reform heresies errors and other ecclesiastical corruptions and enacted That none should appeal to Rome under pain of  Premunire  that the Pope had no authority in Ireland that whoever dared to assert or defend his usurped jurisdiction should incur a  Premunire  that all persons in civil or ecclesiastical offices should swear the  oath of supremacy  appointed or be liable to the pains of treason that none should slander his majesty or queen or their title under pain of treason that the monasteries be suppressed that clergymen pay their annats or revenues of the first year to the king that the twentieth part of the annual profits belonging to any archbishoprick or any other spiritual promotion be yearly paid to him and his successors that no benefices be given to any that cannot speak  English  unless where such as speak it cannot be got and that if necessity require the admission of one that has only the Irish language he shall give his oath that he will do his utmost to learn the English language and observe the English order and teach these under him to do the like and will keep an English school in the parish for that purpose that no  Peter Pence  or any other pension or portion be ever hereafter paid to the Pope or his agents Lord Grey lieutenant by king Henry's order laboured to force the Irish to acknowledge the royal supremacy But though many of them swore the oath few of the native Irish intended any real submission The Pope instigated by the archbishop of Ardmach transmitted an order prohibiting both clergy and laity to acknowledge Henry's supremacy and fixing his dreadful eurse upon all such as had done it unless they penitentially confessed their fault within  forty daysand requiring them to swear to maintain and defend to the utmost of their power the supremacy of the Pope in all things spiritual as well temporaland all the laws liberties and privileges of the Roman church against every opposer and not to obey but oppugn all edicts or commands of heretics made in opposition to the church of Rome and to hold all such as should obey them however near relations or friends ACCURSED  Not long after K Edward VI came to the throne in he transmitted orders to Ireland which about five years before had been declared a  kingdom  instead of a  lordship  That the Liturgy and prayers of the church as now translated into English should be used by the clergy there St Leger the lieutenant called an assembly of the clergy and represented to them his majesty's order and the reasons of it Dowdal of Cordmach still opposed and at last withdrew with all his suffragan bishops except the bishop of Meath Brown of Dublin readily complied Not long after Edward not only required his deputy to propagate the worship of God in the English language but also to get the service translated into the Irish language where the English was not understoodOn Q Mary's accession to the throne in the Popish religion was reestablished The married clergy were turned out and Lancaster bishop of Kildare Travers of Leighlin Bale of Ossory and Casy of Limerick being Protestants left the country and Popish prelates were installed in their room But the rebellious Irish scarce allowed the governors any opportunity of persecuting the handful of heretics in that country  Q Elizabeth having succeeded her sister in a parliament meeting in the beginning of restored the Protestant religion to much the same condition it had been in during the reign of Edward VI abolished the Pope's authority repealed the statutes of Mary concerning heresy and declared That nothing should be held such but what had been determined  so by express scripture or by the first four or some other general councilsnor any man held guilty of it but on the deposition of two proper witnessesrestored the supreme jurisdiction spiritual as well as temporal to the crown and required That all persons in either civil or ecclesiastical offices should take the oath of supremacy under pain of losing his officeand enacted That there be an uniformity in common prayer as in England and in the consecration of bishops and archbishops that the first fruits or annats and th part of spiritual benefices be faithfully paid to the crown that such as maintain the Pope's or any foreign authority over either church or state should for the first offence lose all his goods or be imprisoned for a year if he had not pounds worth of goodsand also lose his benefice if a clergymanand should for the second incur a  Premunire  and for the third incur the pains of high treasonthat such as should speak against the queen's right to the crown should incur a  Premunire  and such as should write against it be held guilty of treason Another meeting of parliament some years afterward appointed that as many of the ecclesiastical dignities were enjoyed by the bastards of the Popish dignitaries who could not speak the English language but had got in by force simony or the like the Lord Lieutenant should for ten years have the sole nomination of the most of the inferior clergy in Munster and Connaught that had not charge of souls and none should be presented unless he were of full age and in church orders and could speak English and would reside at his charge They also enacted That schools should be erected in all the shire towns by the direction of the bishop and sheriffs and their salaries paid by the bishops and their clergy and that the bishops of Ardmach Dublin Meath and Kildare should nominate English schoolmasters for their respective dioceses Encouraged by Pope Pius' excommunication of Elizabeth and his plenary indulgences granted to  such as took up arms against her and by the assistance of the Spaniards the Irish Papists more generally than formerly brake out into an open rebellion against her under the earl of Tyrone and others which continued about twenty years  The Spanish university of Valladolid having it seems informed the Irish Papists that they ought not to obey or assist a Protestant king it was not without difficulty that king James could be got proclaimed in Ireland and notwithstanding the late submission of Tyrone the cities of Cork Waterford Waxford and many others restored the Popish religion by force The Papists sent over their commissioners to complain of the usage they had met with whom James graciously received and entertained with a long pedantic harangue which not satisfying them they appeared as ready to revolt from their benevolent friend as they had from his haughty and excommunicated predecessor Provoked with their behaviour James was obliged to think of some new method of restraining them Though the English had for more than four hundred and thirty years claimed the government of Ireland no more than about a third or fourth part of it in the provinces of Leinster and Munster or counties of Lowth Meath Dublin and Kildare had really been subject to them In the rest of the country crimes could not be punished or taxes levied but by military force And even within their PALE the English inhabitants were often terribly harrassed by the Irish natives in their neighbourhood Ulster the largest province of Ireland having been possessed by the most rude and ungovernable part of the Irish had by means of Tyrone's obstinate and repeated rebellions been rendered an almost desolate wilderness James having attainted the rebels seized on their lands and ordered them to be distributed to such British Protestants as could and would undertake rightly to plant them The difficulties of planting that country  country infested by wolves and other wild beasts and by still more barbarous Irish Papists obliged both James and the undertakers to encourage both Scots and English to go thither Being persecuted at home not a few of the Presbyterians went thither from Scotland and of the Puritans from England in order to enjoy their liberty of worshipping God according to his own word To encourage them James granted full liberty of conscience to them as well as he did afterward to the planters of New England The chiefs of the established church were far more moderate and kind to the Puritans than their courtfavoured brethren in Britain Loftus archbishop of Dublin invited over Mr Travers who had been persecuted by Whitgift of Canterbury and in made him provost of the newly erected college of that city Messrs Fullerton and Hamilton two Scotch Presbyterians the last of them tutor to the afterward famous bishop Usher were two of the first fellows of that college These gave several of the Irish doctors and dignitaries a tincture of Puritanism The lord deputy who had been a pupil of Cartwright at Cambridge brought over Mr Hubart his fellow pupil and fixed him minister at Carrickfergus Sir John Clotworthy entertained Messrs Ridge and Calvert the first of whom was placed at Antrim and the other at Carrickfergus From Scotland Mess Bryce came to Broad island Cuningham to Holywood Dunbar to Learn Welsh to Templepatrick and afterwards Hamilton to Ballywater Blair to Bangor Stewart to Dunagor and Livingston to Killinshie  c c  all of whom though Presbyterians enjoyed the established churches and tithes Knox bishop of Rapho and some others of his brethren were so condescending as to require no more in the ordination of Presbyterian ministers than that themselves should be present  as ministers  to make the deed legal along with such others as the candidates pleased and allowed all the passages of the form of ordination at which these  candidates scrupled to be omitted The bishops consulted them about affairs of common concern to the church and some of them were members of the convocation in At the desire of the bishop of Down Mr Blair preached before the judges of assize on the Lord's day before his curate administered the sacrament to them They had no Presbyteries for the exercise of church discipline but every minister with his session exercised it in his own congregation Yet they had a monthly meeting at Antrim in which they used to spend two days in praying preaching and religious conference and in devising proper means for the further spread of the gospel and extirpation of Popery By their amazing diligence in praying preaching catechizing visiting from house to house observation of solemn fasts and celebration of the Lord's supper the planters were remarkably reformed Their communions which they observed in each congregation at least twice a year were exceedingly crowded and many thousands thereat converted to Christ It is said that about a thousand underwent that blessed change at one sacramental occasionTheir piety peaceableness and usefulness in reforming the people made archbishop Usher and his moderate brethren and the civil governors of the country approve protect and encourage them But no sooner had Laud become bishop of London and especially when advanced to be primate of Canterbury than he by stirring up enemies against them both in England and Ireland laboured to ruin them and so weaken the Protestant interest in that kingdom Messrs Livingston Blair Cunningham Ridge Bryce Hamilton and Calvert were deposed by the bishop They and about others in the end of failed about leagues for New England but by a dreadful storm were driven back to Ireland from whence several of them soon after came to Scotland and assisted in the remarkable reformation there in  Hitherto the few Irish Protestants had contented themselves with a practical regard to the  Thirtynine articles  of the English church But the Protestant religion being now somewhat established their convocation in agreed after the manner of other Protestant churches to draw up a  Confession of Faith  of their own which might at once manifest their principles and mark their independence on the church of England Usher then provost of the college of Dublin drew it up in articles concerning the scriptures and creeds God's nature persons purposes and works of creation and providence man's fall and natural state of sin and misery Christ's person and mediation union with him in effectual calling justification and faith sanctification and good works service and worship of God power of civil magistrates duty to neighbours church and her gospel ministry church authority general councils and bishops of Rome state of the Old and New Testament sacraments baptism and Lord's supper state of departed souls resurrectionand last judgment In this Confession The antiArminian articles of Lambeth mentioned in our English history are plainly incorporated The morality of the Christian Sabbath is strongly asserted and the spending of it wholly in religious exercises is required  Art  The observation of Lent is declared not to be religious but merely for promoting political advantages  Art  The validity of ordination by presbyters is acknowledged  Art  The power of the keys is said to be only declarative of the will of Christ  Art  The Pope is declared Antichrist  Art  Probably to avoid all distinguishing between bishops and priests no mention is made of the consecration of archbishops or bishops No power of making canons or of censuring the infringers of them is ascribed to the church These articles were approved by the Irish convocation and parliament and ratified by his majesty K  James and his council They appear to have been contrived to compromise the differences between the church and the Puritans and they had that effect till by the influence of archbishop Laud and the earl of Strafford they were set aside in and those of the church of England adopted in their room  King James had not a little indulged the Papists Charles I had no sooner come to the throne and married a bigotted Papist than they mightily increased and became extremely bold and insolent being as bishop Bedell informed Laud about nine parts of ten of the nation and having priests settled in almost every parish while the established clergy not knowing their language were of little or no use in a great part of the island When lord Falkland the deputy conveened their chiefs at Dublin in for contributing towards the defence of their country against a Spanish invasion they roundly told him that they would contribute nothing unless they got an  authoritative toleration  and liberty to build religious houses This awakened the Protestant bishops to meet and form a solemn protestation bearing That as the religion of Papists is superstitious and idolatrous and their church apostatical the granting of them a toleration would be exceedingly sinful as it would involve the granters and approvers in an approbation of all the abominations of Popery and in the perdition of these souls that perish thereby and that to grant them it on account of money any way given by them would be to set religion to sale and with it the souls which Christ had redeemed by his blood This was signed by archbishop Usher and eleven of his fellow bishops and presented to the lord deputy and council This retarded thesr desired toleration They nevertheless became more and more insolent and erected public oratories colleges mass houses and convents Their archbishops and other rulers exercised their authority derived from Rome and excommunicated such  as appeared at the courts of the Protestant bishops and even openly said mass in the established churches Lord Falkland published a proclamation against their conduct but without effect In they obtained a toleration in consideration of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds to be paid to government within three years  Archbishop Laud being now chancellor of the university of Dublin and having Strafford the deputy ready to assist him insisted in the convocation that for silencing the Papists objection of the Protestants diversity of principles the  Thirtynine articles  of the English church should be adopted as their ecclesiastical standard The convocation inadvertently complied and even made a canon appointing That whosoever should maintain that any of these articles might not be subscribed by him with a good conscience should be excommunicated Thus they denounced a sentence of excommunication against all the Puritans They excluded their own articles which so plainly condemned Arminianism and maintained the Pope's sanctification of the Christian Sabbath This together with the prosecution of the Presbyterian ministers above mentioned by bishop Bramhall and others divided weakened and dispirited the Protestants while it encouraged the Papists in their hopes of speedily carrying all before them No sooner had Strafford heard of the Scots reformation and their entering into covenant with God in than he imposed an oath on all Scotch men and Scotch women promising an unlimited obedience to all his majesty's commands and to enter into no oath or covenant without his authority and to renounce all covenants contrary to this oath The dissenters generally refused this oath because it was not imposed by the parliamentthey knew that his majesty was bound by his coronation oath to rule his subjects according to the word of God and laws of the land The allegiance promised in it was explained to them as including an observation of  all the ceremonies and government of the church established or to be established by his majesty they thought it absurd to swear that they would not enter into a bond of mutual self defence against the Papists without his majesty's command they saw that it was intended to disgrace or root the Scots out of Ireland and bound the swearers to renounce and condemn the Scotch covenanters protestations and covenants they grudged that it bound them never to resist the king or any commissioned by him they liked it the worse that an army of  eight thousand Irish Papists  were sent to force this oath upon them in Ulster which obliged the refusers of it to flee into Scotland This forced flight was made the mean of their preservation from the subsequent massacre in which most of the compliers not only lost their worldly substance for the sake of which they had defiled their conscience but their lives and the lives of their families  Encouraged by Laud and Strafford Bramhall and other highflying bishops and clergymen all along from to exceedingly distressed the Scotch of whom there were then about an hundred thousand and the English Puritans in Ulster In their petition for redress of grievances presented to the English parliament in they complain That even before they had so much as a pretended  canon  for their warrant some of the bishops had violently urged the observation of their ceremonieshad silenced several of their most learned and faithful ministers and oppressed others in their courts for noncompliance that in the convocation had made such canons as enjoined many corruptions in the worship of God and government of his church and which exceedingly retarded the work of reformation encouraged Papists and made way for many Popish superstitions that their most painful pious and learned ministers had been silenced deprived nay forced to flee the country and afterward excommunicated and some of them lost their lives that  while ignorant lazy erroneous profane and cruel men had been obtruded on them for ministers others for scrupling at the new ceremonies or even merely for their holy lives were kept out of office that while faithful ministers were hindered from executing their office or enjoying their benefice bishops held many livings  in commendam  and conferred four five or six livings on their children or other favourites who were no way capable to take care of souls but hired some pitiful curates as cheap as they could while themselves were permitted to reside where they pleased that while the bishops seldom preached themselves they earnestly suppressed afternoon sermons on the Lord's day and all weekly lectures so that a lecturing minister is in more danger before them than a Popish priest or trafficking Jesuit that to prevent faithful and pious scruplers at the ceremonies from being useful in teaching schools they urged on schoolmasters a subscription beyond their  canons  and excommunicated such as refused it that they favoured Popery permitted Papists to keep schools some of them so large as to resemble universities in which not only languages but also liberal sciences were taught and permitted multitudes of  mass priests  publicly to celebrate  mass  and permitted  friaries  and  nunneries  in their dioceses that the bishops published or encouraged wicked libels and used profane raileries and cursings  c  to render the Scots and their late reforming procedure odious that they practised and encouraged the selling of church censures and sacramentsand by the most base means draw in gain to themselves from old superstitious customsand will not marry the poor who cannot pay the dues nor suffer their dead to be decently buriedand excommunicated multitudes for not payment of the most unjust or trifling demands that in their High Commission court they sat judges in their own and all other causes and terribly oppressed men by fines and imprisonments  c  that they not only condemned the Scotch covenant  of but had concurred with Strafford in imposing an oath for renouncing it in consequence of which many thousands had been hunted out apprehended fined or imprisoned and even women just before childbirth seized threatened and terrified that these bishops and their faction had unjustly seized upon the best lands bereaving almost every gentleman of part of his inheritance that by their own swearing cursing drunkenness and Sabbathbreaking and by their having the most profane servants in the kingdom they were a reproach to the gospel and a stumbling block to the Papists  In K Charles finding himself obliged to yield to the Scots and not a little embroiled with his English parliament by the instigation of his queen appears to have encouraged the Papists in Ireland to seize the government of that country and then to assist him with an army against the Puritans in England or Presbyterians in Scotland Glad of this opportunity the Papists encouraged by their clergy resolved on a general massacre of all the Protestants in the kingdom without regard to station age sex or relation They laid their scheme and kept their secrets so well that it was in a great measure out of the Protestants power who were but about a sixth part of the nation if so much to prevent the execution of it It was discovered by Owen O'Conolly an Irishman who being servant to Sir John Clotworthy had become a Presbyterian dissenter by means of which the seizure of Dublin was preventedand the Scots in the north of Ireland were impowered to take arms against the Popish murderers and the Lords Justices transmitted accounts of their desperate condition unless they should be speedily relieved with men and money to Charles and his English parliament Notwithstanding his fair pretences he in many things behaved like one that wished these Protestants utter destruction and  the Papists success in their work and that was exceedingly averse to declare them rebels Meanwhile they pushed on their murdering work in the end of October and afterwards In the province of Ulster alone are said to have been destroyed in the cruellest forms The day before the massacre began the priests dismissed the people from mass with an encouragement to seize on the property of the Protestants and to kill them as a certain preservative against the pains of purgatory When it began the Popish gentry persuaded many of their Protestant neighbours to bring them their goods and they would preserve them for them and at least secure them a safe retreat from the country Having got their goods they next stripped many of them particularly women and children stark naked and turned them out to perish amidst the frost and snow by cold and hunger So many thousands of them died that the living being insufficient to bury them their carcases were heaped up together in large holes of the earth Multitudes they sportfully drowned hanged or stabbed to death even after they had given them promises of safe conductor had cruelly driven them along pushing them forward with stabs of their swords or bayonets Sometimes they dispatched them so quickly by hewing them in pieces or otherwise that they would allow them no time to pray Sometimes they shut them up in lothsome dungeons with or without bolts or fetters on their legs that they might languish to death in great misery Others they buried alive or hanged up on tenter hooks or dragged them by ropes through waters woods or bogs Others particularlywomen or children had their bellies ript up and guts taken or let fall out The unborn babes that fell from their mother's belly they trod under foot gave to their dogs and swine to eat or cast into ditches Other infants they held upon the point of their swords that their sprawling might divert them Some they cruelly slashed in their heads faces  breasts  c  and then left them wallowing in their blood to languish starve and pine to death Other they shut up in houses and sportfully burnt them in them or they plucked out their eyes and cut off their hands and then turned them out to wander in the fields till they perished Some they decoyed to murder their own parents or to profess themselves Papists and then cut their throats or drowned them Others they worried with dogs or by ripping up their belly tied one end of their tripes to a tree and drove them round about it till all their bowels were gradually pulled out ln these and many similar forms the Protestants were murdered Many of their dead bodies were left unburied and especially these of women exposed and abused in the most shameful manner and had candles made of their grease One Papist boasted That his hands were so wearied with killing Protestants that he could not lift them to his head another That he had killed sixteen of them in a few hours▪ others That they had killed so many that the grease which stuck to their swords might make an Irish candle Nay two boys boasted That at several times they had murdered women and children The Popish women were no less ready to instruct excite to or assist their husbands and children in cruelty Such Bibles as were found were profanely trodden under foot or otherwise destroyed Such was the piety and humanity of the Papists whom we have lately adopted as our  dear friends and children  Though the embroiled state of affairs in Britain not a little hindered their assisting of the Irish Protestants yet the Scots who took arms in the North assisted by six thousand brave troops from their mother country repressed the Papists power in Ulster while the English troops under Coots and Monk gave them several rebuffs in Leinsternotwithstanding all that Owen Roe their great general who had come to their assistance could do to prevent it  They who had a little before in their convention laboured in planning a form of government for the kingdom were in disposed to offer their submission to Charles A cessation of arms was agreed on for a year which neither pleased the zealous Protestants nor the bigotted Papists the latter of whom paid little regard to it but went on with their murdering work The Popish chiefs represented to their Popish queen That if they could obtain a peace to their mind they would assist Charles with ten thousand troops against his parliament in England In consequence hereof not Ormond lord lieutenant who was too zealous for the Protestant church of England but the earl of Glamorgan was by Charles impowered to conclude a secret treaty of peace with the Irish Papists while Ormond and they were for a sham travelling to establish a public one By this  private treaty  the Papists had the free exercise of their religion and all the churches which they had possessed since secured to them and were fully freed from all the authority of the Episcopal church  Notwithstanding these favours the Irish were not so ready as Charles expected to send over their  ten thousand  troops to England pretending That they had only bound themselves to assist in transporting them over by sea Meanwhile this secret treaty was discovered Finding that both English and Scots were highly displeased with it Charles in his deceitful manner disavowed the solemn commission which he had given to Glamorgan and that nobleman was imprisoned by Ormond The Presbyterians of Ulster as well as the whole Protestants of Munster declared themselves against this infamous peace Nor did the Irish Papists take care to fulfil the conditions of it While duke Hamilton and his party in Scotland projected their relieving of king Charles in without any limitations of his power Ormond by the instigation of the queen and prince of Wales now in France concluded a peace  with the Papists bearing That they should enjoy the free exercise of their religion and enjoy all churches and livings which they now possessed and all jurisdiction respecting them without being required to swear the  oath of supremacy  to the king that a parliament be held within six months or whenever after the Papists desire that all laws and indictments of Papists shall be vacated that Papists shall be admitted members of parliament and enjoy all honours trusts and employments equally as Protestants that not only shall every thing done by Papists in the time by past be passed in oblivion but such of them as have had their estates taken from them or wronged by grants since king James came to the throne shall have their grievances redressed and losses refunded that his majesty shall grant whatever is necessary to Papists Charles himself in a letter to Ormond but which came not to his hand till after the treaty was finished disavowed it Ormond however probably by private directions from the king or queen made twelve Papists sharers with him in his authority that he could neither levy soldiers nor raise money nor erect garrisons without the consent of a majority of them  No wonder that the true Protestants in Britain and Ireland were highly dissatisfied with this treaty since by it these bloody murderers who had filled their skirts with the innocent blood of about two hundred thousand Protestants and by rapine treachery and cruelty had laid waste a flourishing kingdom during the last seven years were not only pardoned but well rewarded for their work and their idolatrous and wicked religion had such security given it as it had never before received in Ireland The number of these malecontents in Ireland was greater than could have been well expected In the most of the Episcopalian clergy were either murdered or had fled into England the Scots not only sent over ministers with their troops in but afterwards on applications from Ireland sent  over in different years a considerable number of Presbyterian ministers who laboured with remarkable succss in the work of the Lord Not a few who had fled from Strafford's persecution returned to Ireland as soon as the Scotch inhabitants and troops had almost cleared Ulster of the Popish massacrers These all with great zeal avowed their adherence to the doctrine worship discipline and government represented by the Assembly of Westminster in the standards which they compiled and entered into the  solemn league and covenant  for the perpetual maintenance thereof The English parliament required the rest of the Protestants in Ireland to do the same according to their ordinance for that effect in the kingdom of England in obedience to which not a few took it Few of these covenanters perhaps above an hundred thousand in all but were highly dissatisfied with the late  treaty of peace  During the preceding years Ormond had laboured to gain over the parliament's party in Ireland particularly their military commanders Jones Coots Monk  c  but without success He now laboured to unite the several parties in the kingdom for Charles II who from the Hague had written him a letter confirming the late peace and continuing him lord lieutenant of Ireland He had no success with Jones Coots and other parliamentarians But he had more success with the Scots of Ulster who like their fellow Presbyterians in Britain were many of them infatuated in favour of their royal family and easily imposed upon by Charles' and his agents fair pretences Sir John Clotworthy's regiment laid down their arms rather than enter into an army with malignants and Popish confederates but these under the lord of Ards as well as those commanded by Monro who had just returned from Scotland whither he had gone to assist in the Hamiltonian engagementjoined Ormond and turned their arms against their fellow covenanters and took Belfast and Carrickfergus As the Irish Presbyterians had renewed  their covenant with God about the end of Messrs Greig of Carrickfergus and Cuningham of Broad island and other ministers reflected on those that had joined with Ormond and his Popish confederatesthey were therefore threatened by both Scotch and Irish officers and obliged to flee for their safety This alarming the people the Lord of Ards now viscount and commander of all his majesty's forces in the province of Ulster published a  declaration  representing the reasons of his conduct and many fair promises to take care of their religion and liberties to the utmost of his power as soon as the parliament's forces should be driven out The presbytery of Bangor in July published a  counter declaration  in which they testify against all compliance with the Sectaries on the one hand or with Ormond and his malignants and Papists on the other but patiently to suffer rather than sinand faithfully expose the deceit of Ard's proclamation and warn all that wish to be faithful to their covenant with God to give him and his party no countenanceas the righteous vengeance of God would quickly overtake them which indeed it did within about a month after by the parliament's army Ormond had no success with the bigotted Papists who were headed by the Pope's nuncio and who sometimes assisted the parliamentarians against him but they at last obliged him to retire to France and leave the earl of Clanrickard general of his majesty's army and lieutenant of Ireland in his room Charles' renunciation of his confirmation of the peace and his approbation of the Scotch covenant and professed resolution to hold the friends or enemies of it for his friends or enemies made the Irish Papists lay aside their intentions to push him into his throne They then entered into an agreement with Charles IV duke of Lorrain to accept of him as their sovereign but their dissatisfaction with Clanrickard and the parliament's forces taking their towns one after another put a stop to it Their conquest of the country being  finished in May Fleetwood Ludlow Corbet Jones and Weaver esquires were appointed by the English parliament to command the army and to govern the nation in their name High courts of justice were erected at Dublin before which Sir Phelim O'Neal the chief manager of the massacre and about others of these murderers were tried condemned and executed  During the following eight years the Popish interest was lower than ever it had been in Ireland since its first introduction into it Multitudes perhaps above an hundred thousand of them fled into France and Spain Such as remained were generally pent up in Connaught the western province of that island while their estates in other places were parcelled out among the conquering troops and other adventurers Their very name was reckoned detestable Independents Anabaptists and others from England went thither and while they laboured in propagating the gospel of Christ had the peculiar countenance of the government The zeal of the Presbyterian clergy for the royal family exposed them to manifold hardships Immediately after the execution of king Charles I they published a  declaration  against the actors of it as  traitors  and  murderers  from all their pulpits and warned their people to beware of owning their authority When colonel Venables came to their country they continued to testify against the usurpations of the Sectaries and to pray publicly for the restoration of Charles II to his throne Many of them were therefore imprisoned or forced to flee their houses and walk disguised and to preach in the fields or hills As they and their people when before the council of war at Carrickfergus unanimously refused to take the  Engagement  against kingly government an act of banishment was passed against the ministers because they kept alive the interest of the king among the people and reproached those in power as treacherous to his majesty and breakers of covenant No persuasion could prevail  with them to present any addresses to Cromwel when the most of the three nations did it They would never pray for him nor his underlings or read the causes of their fasts or thanksgivings or observe their days of humiliation because they could not own them as magistrates No encouraging offers or affrighting threatenings of Cromwel or his fellow usurpers could detach them from their loyalty to the really profligate but as yet masked Charles During their troubles these Presbyterian ministers were not a little useful in winning many souls to Christ  No sooner did the motions for Charles' restoration to his throne begin to gain ground than the Presbyterian ministers of Ireland like their infatuated brethren in Britain pushed it on with all their might At first Charles entertained them with fair words and a promise of pounds sterling to these ministers that survived and to their widows who had died before his restoration as a reward of their attachment to him during the ten preceding years But he was no sooner fixed on his throne than he and his agents having restored Episcopacy and indulged Popery expelled them from their churches and persecuted them as well as the Independents and Anabaptists to their utmost as circumscribed by their indulgence It is probable they had been more cruelly handled had it not been for giving some colour to the courtindulgence practically granted to Papists These very men who had complied in every thing with Cromwel and his sectaries now reproached them as disloyal and treacherous Most of the Papists that had retired to France or Spain now returned They and their brethren expected that as Charles had been bred up in their religion and had not long before solemnly professed himself a member of their church they would enjoy the favours granted by the treaty of above mentioned and every one of them have his lands restored to him which had been given to soldiers or undertakers for the  expence of the war by Cromwel's settlement The English parliament supported Cromwel's settlement in this matter and ordered such lands only to be restored to the Papists as had any flaw in the conveyance The determination of these disputed claims occasioned no small contention between the Papists and Protestants In consequence of the Papists insolence the English parliament in petitioned his majesty That he would maintain the  act of settlement of property  in Ireland and recall his Commission of inquiry granted January last because it includes new powers tending to invalidate that settlement and to occasion many unnecessary lawsuits that he would order that no Papist be continued or hereafter admitted to be any kind of judge in that kingdom that he would command all the Popish archbishops particularly Talbot archbishop of Dublin and other dignitaries who exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction by the Pope's authority to depart out of Ireland and all other his dominions and that all convents and other Popish seminaries of learning should be dissolved that no Irish Papist be allowed to dwell in any part of the kingdom without special licence and that he would recall his letter of and the order of council founded thereon which require That none prosecute any of the Irish for any thing committed during the last rebellion But this no way hindered the increase of Popery The Popish plot in England which happened soon after occasioned some severe orders against them but their influence was quickly suspended  JAMES II had no sooner ascended the throne in than his Popish brethren in Ireland hoped to carry every thing before them and in about three or four years committed more insolencies upon the English than these had done upon them in five hundred years past They did all they could to inform against such Protestants as they suspected to be ill affected to James with respect to their words deeds  or meetings The duke of Ormond resigned his sword of state to the archbishop of Ardmach and the earl of Granard though the chief power was really vested in the earl of Tyrconnel who being lieutenant of the army modelled his troops so as might best answer his master's designs He was soon after advanced to be lord lieutenant In that station he acted in the most arbitrary and despotic manner He turned the English Protestants out of the army in the most reproachful and afflicting manner he could By frequently changing the seven or eight thousand standing troops he got five times that number taught the use of their arms He issued forth Quo Warranto's against all the charters of the nation at once in order to subvert the corporations and secure a Popish parliament Popish judges were appointed in each court Papists were also appointed high sheriffs and justices of peace and members of privy council so that they were able to rule all wherever they came James had not long retired to France from before his soninlaw who invaded his kingdom in order to rescue it from his tyrannical oppressions when he landed from thence in Ireland with about two thousand staunch British and Irish Papists to support his interests As king William had greatly overlooked the circumstances of Ireland and colonel Hamilton had treacherously deserted him and reduced his friends in that country to the very brink of destruction James had here the most promising appearances in his favour All the kingdom except Ulster being in obedience to him Tyrconnel had ready for him an army of about forty thousand horse and foot Had James taken the advice of Claverhouse and others of his friends to transport his powerful army to Britain he might have shook if not overturned the unsettled authority of his soninlaw But he chose first to make himself master of every corner of Ireland He therefore besieged the remains of the Protestant troops in Londonderry Notwithstanding the cowardice or treachery of Lundie their  commander and the villany of General Kirk in not making due haste to relieve themand notwithstanding the dreadful famine they suffered in the siege they held out against the enemy Rosen a French general under James provoked by the valour of the besieged now reduced to skeletons with hunger caused his troops to burn every house for ten miles around and to bring all the inhabitants men women and children to him These to the number of six or seven thousand he drove with drawn swords under the walls of the city threatening the besieged▪ That if they did not surrender the place within ten days he would put every one of these poor people to the sword before their eyes This horrid device shocked the besiegers and animated the besieged with a furious valour After these poor creatures had continued two days without any food such as were able were permitted to go away but the destruction or plunder of all that had belonged to them rendered them absolutely miserableAfter that about of the besieged had perished with hunger and otherwise and these that remained were sunk with fatigue and had no more than provision for two days they offered to capitulate Hereon Kirk making a bold attempt to throw in some provisions sent up the river three victualling ships with a man of war to protect them By warmly discharging her guns on the batteries which the enemy had planted on the sides of the river the warship drew their fire on herself Meanwhile the foremost of the Victuallers having a favourable gale of wind pushed forward with such force as to break the strong iron boom which king James had laid across the river but ran herself aground by the violence of the stroke to the inexpressible grief of the besieged and joy of the besieging beholders But in a few minutes by the rebound of her own discharged guns she got off and along with her two followers got safe into the harbour James and his Papists raised the siege next day after continuing it about three months and an  half His army under Schomberg being unsuccessful king William came over himself to command themand by his own victory at the river Boyne and General Ginkle's at Agrim and the taking of Limerick just when the French fleet were ready to relieve it finished the war The Limerickers obtained for themselves and their fellow Papists very advantageous conditions that without taking any other but the oath of allegiance they should enjoy the same freedom of exercising their religion and the same title to their civil property as under king Charles II Their repeated insolence occasioned by the commissioners management of the forfeited estates prompted the parliament of to restrict this act and to appoint That all the estates of Papists should be equally divided among their children unless that he to whom they were left took the  sacramental Test  and joined in the  communion of the established church  But this act hath been lately repealed  The Protestant dissenters Presbyterians Independents and others had an authoritative toleration granted them by king William's first parliament Some of the established bishops exceedingly grudged them this liberty and the rather that their number was about double to that of the established church Messrs Boyse and M'Bride two of the most bold and faithful dissenting ministers had their share of troublesome prosecution on account of some free speeches they were said to have uttered against Episcopacy and its superstitious connexionsBy means of influence from England queen Anne's first parliament imposed the  sacramental test  on the dissenters as a condition of their admission to any share in the government What trouble any of them endured for refusing this or the  oath of abjuration  imposed about the same time I know not Meanwhile Emlyn who had learned the Arian tenets in England came over and for eleven years was assistant to Mr Boyse at Dublin where he secretly spread them  Notwithstanding all his subtilty he was at last detected by Mr Boyse and obliged to return to England where till about he assisted Dr Clark and Jackson to impugn the true divinity of Jesus Christ in opposition to Dr Waterland and his orthodox assistants But the infection which he had introduced continued and even spread among the dissenters in Ireland and occasioned no small contention Between and the Synod of Ulster in seven several meetings had very warm disputations concerning the propriety of requiring candidates for the ministerial office to declare their adherence to the Westminster or any similar  Confession of Faith  by subscription or otherwise Many other dissenting clergymen who detested the Arian blasphemies became tainted with Baxterian and Arminian errors attended with not a little looseness of practice Offended herewith not a few of their Presbyterian hearers soon after the  deposition  of the Seceding ministers in Scotland by the Assembly applied to them for the supply of evangelical preaching and other ministrations in consequence of which there are now about fifty or sixty seceding congregations in that kingdom especially in the province of Ulster Of about four and twenty hundred thousand inhabitants in Ireland it is said that about two thirds only are now professed Papists and the other eight hundred thousand Protestants But I fear scarce the half of these deserve the Protestant name  BRIEF SKETCH of the History of the Protestant Churches in AMERICA  IT is probable that America was for the most part peopled from the eastern parts of Asia But when Columbus in A D first discovered that country there did not appear in it the smallest vestiges of the gospel of Christ nor did the Spaniards murdering of about fifty millions of the inhabitants in the least instruct them in or attach them to it Elizabeth and James' cruel persecution of the English Puritans obliged part of them to flee to Holland and afterward to America where they landed in the country since called New England Finding that their Independent congregation was like to dwindle to nothing in Holland part of Mr Robinson's people after a solemn fast and much fervent prayer first set sail for America in two ships and after terrible distress by the way occasioned by the treachery of the shipmasters and the bad weather they at last in Nov arrived to the number of about an hundred having lost one of their ships In the place to which Providence directed them contrary to their own inclinations God had prepared room for them by a plague which in the preceding year had carried off about nine tenths of the inhabitants But the fatigue of their voyage and the severity of the winter cut off not a few of them Some others of them were killed by the savage natives It was not till midsummer that supply came to them from England  The season being very untoward their first crop was bad Contentions kindled by incendiaries among themselves added to their misery In expectation of Mr Robinson and the rest of his congregation following them they had no minister among them for eight years but Mr Brewster who had been ruling elder of their church at Leyden preached visited and examined them and at their week day meetings some of the elder brethren prayed and expounded some portion of scripture to the rest Hearing of Mr Robinson's death they in chose and ordained for their pastor one Mr Ralph Smith by fasting and laying on of the hands of the elders Except their placing the supreme government of the church in the community of the faithful under Christ and holding every particular congregation for an entire Christian church independent of their Presbytery or Synod their principles were the same with those contained in the  Westminster Confession of Faith Directory for worship  and  Form of church government  They admitted such as were communicants in the French Dutch and Scotch churches to communion with them  In Mr Conant and his friends instigated by Mr White of Dorchester retired to America and in got a royal patent for so much of the country They after some consultation and solemn covenanting with God and with one another to avouch the Lord for their God and to walk soberly righteously and godly before him and to be obedient to their superiors in both church and state and to train up their children and servants in the knowledge and fear of the Lordjoined together and chose Mr Skelton for their pastor Mr Higginson for their teacher and Mr Houghton for their ruling elder who were ordained to their offices by prayer and laying on of the hands of these appointed to represent the brethren Meanwhile some Prelatists and one Christopher Gardiner a disguised Papist gave them some trouble and misrepresented them in England  Messrs Wilson Cotton Hooker Stone Mather and seventytwo other ministers who had fled from the persecution in England had all settlements and some of them numerous flocks of the persecuted people who had come along with them as early as About twenty others had not got settlements or had been turned out for their ill behaviour or for their Episcopalian and Anabaptist principles The  Harvard college  for the education of youth in all the literal arts was erected at Newtown or Cambridge about six or eight miles from Boston and soon after furnished with a valuable library Meanwhile their state had no small trouble with the Indian savages in their neighbourhood and their church no less with the Antinomian and Familistical errors that sprung up among them The male members of the church at Boston used to meet once a week to repeat the sermons they heard on the Lord's day and to debate on their contents As none of the women were allowed to mingle in these debates some of them resolved on having separate meetings of their own Mrs Hutchinson having set up one at her house had soon  sixty  or  eighty  women at her weekly meeting to hear her pray and repeat and explain Mr Cotton's sermons Under pretence of exalting the free grace of God she taught her disciples That believers in Christ are personally united with the Holy Ghost that commands to work out our salvation with fear and trembling belong only to unbelievers that sanctification is not a sufficient evidence of a gracious state that believers have immediate revelations concerning future events as infallible as the scriptures themselves  c  The women readily embraced these notions and insinuated them into their husbands as the doctrines of Mr Cotton Such as continued otherwise minded were reproached as legalists and the old ministers were starved away and mechanics set up in their room Violent struggles were made to have new fashioned gospellers for  the only magistrates and officers in their armies Mrs Hutchison's modest behaviour before Mr Cotton and his too charitable opinion of her rendered him too tardy in opposing her seductions But both church and state being like to be thereby ruined a Synod for consultation and advice composed of ministers and messengers of the churches and some magistrates was held at Newtown in August During three weeks and after hearing all that the Antinomians could say about eighty of their opinions were unanimously condemned excepting that Mr Cotton differed at least in words from his brethren on three or four of them But Mrs Hutchison and her followers so insolently opposed the determination of the Synod that it was found necessary for both church and state to exert themselves in repressing them  The civil war breaking out in England the Puritans got liberty at home and the colonies of New England for twenty years instead of receiving new recruits lost a number of their gentlemen together with Mess Samuel Mather Giles Furmin Hugh Peters and nine other ministers who returned to England The planters who had already built fifty towns and villages and thirty or forty churches  c  resolved to seize on the Islands on the coast and propagate the gospel among the natives They also granted three of their ministers to the Virginians But the governor ordered them to leave the country unless they would conform to the English ceremonies A war with the Indians quickly issued in a treaty of peace and in a more close confederation of the four colonies of New England About Mr Elliot in the province of Massachusett and Mr Mayhew in Martha's vineyard applied themselves to the instruction of the Indians with an amazing assiduity and zeal and were instrumental in converting several thousands of them to Christ Elliot translated the  Bible Catechisms  and some other practical books into the language of his Indians The English parliament  established a corporation of sixteen for the propagation of the gospel in New England and appointed a collection for that purpose which enabled the society to purchase an estate of five or six hundred pounds sterling yearly rent Bedinfield a Papist from whom they bought it after Charles' restoration seized upon it but the society now increased to the number of with no small trouble recovered itwith the rent of which and with the large collections gathered in New England they have been sometimes able to maintain ten missionaries and to erect schools and educate Indian children It is to be lamented that for some time past part of the money is too readily applied for supporting naughty Episcopalian ministers in that country and that any American missionaries that appear bent on winning souls to Christ are so much opposed and discouraged by the English planters and merchants  The second Synod of New England met at Cambridge in and approved the  Westminster Confession of Faith  Their chief work was to frame a  Platform of church discipline  In this they assert That all the parts of church government are exactly described in the word of God and no man may add diminish or alter any thing in it that even circumstances of time and place must be regulated by the apostolical prescription of  doing all things decently and in order  that the catholic church comprehends all elected and redeemed men that though the state of the visible militant church under the law was national it is now under the gospel only congregational that a congregational church consists of a company of saints by calling united into one body by an holy covenant for the public worship of God and mutual edification of one another in the fellowship of Christ or consists of such as understand the principles of religion profess their repentance and faith in Christ and walk in blameless obedience to all his commands that every particular church has a ministry appointed for its particular service and no other and the members  ought never to be more than can conveniently meet in one place nor fewer than carry on church work that the form of a particular visible church is that covenant by which they give up themselves to the Lord Christ to observe his ordinances in the same society that all believers ought to join themselves as they have opportunity to some particular church that they may profess their subjection to the order and ordinances of the gospel that the supreme power over the church belongs to Christ power of office to the eldership and power of privilege and appointing to office to the brotherhood that church officers are appointed by Christ as necessary to the wellbeing of his church till the end of the worldand are either extraordinary as apostles prophets evangelists or ordinary as elders teaching and ruling and deacons that pastors and teachers are distinct officers but both are to administer sacraments and church censures that antient widows ought to minister in the church in attending on the sick that none should be ordained officers in the church without sufficient trial and the power of election as well as deposition is in that particular church in which they serve that the church ought not only to choose but by laying on of hands ordain their officers that  election  constitutes one a church officer and  ordination  doth but solemnly admit him to his work The laying on of hands is to be performed by the elders of that church or other elders desired by them or by some of the brethren chosen for that purpose that if any officer be discharged from his office in his own church he may not exercise it in any other until he be again called to office and be reordained that the power granted to the brotherhood lies in their admitting members choosing and deposing officers and in determining differencesand the power of the elders to feed and rule the church conveen them on proper occasions preside and keep order in debates examine officers and members in order to admission receive accusations pronounce  sentences and bless the people in the name of the Lord that as it is the duty of people decently to support their ministers deacons and magistrates ought to see to their doing it that in order to admission to be church members they be examined concerning their faith and repentance and profess the samebut if they be unable to declare the work of God on their souls before the church it may suffice to do it before the elders who may relate it before the church that members may not remove from any particular church without her consent unless where duty safety or subsistence render it absolutely necessary that in offences originally private one is only to be excommunicated if obstinately deaf to private dealings and admonition of the church but if the offence be of a very heinous and public nature he is to be excommunicated at once that excommunication doth not deprive men of their civil offices or rights nor exclude them from hearing the word or occasional admonitions that none should withdraw from the communion of a church because some disorderly persons cannot be removed out of it that sister churches should care for consult with admonish and hold occasional fellowship with one another and when a church becomes too numerous it ought to form another of such members as are willing to remove that Synods composed of elders and messengers of churches are very often necessary to the well being of churchesto debate and determine controversies of faith and cases of conscience to give directions from the word of God in worship and governmentand to bear witness against corruption of manners and maladministrationbut they are not to inflict any censure or make any authoritative act that such Synods may be called either by the churches themselves or by the magistrate that magistrates may not compel their subjects to become church members or partake of sacraments nor meddle with any work proper to church officers that magistrates ought to restrain and punish  not only dishonesty murder and the like but also idolatry blasphemy heresy open profanation of the Sabbath contempt of the word or disturbance of the worship of God or even schismatical disturbance of churches Some of these rules have been long disused Ministers have administered the sacraments to vacant churches only the neighbouring ministers lay on hands at ordinations None are required publicly to declare the work of God upon their soul and ruling elders are generally dropt For supporting religion and virtue of every kind a sett of the most excellent civil laws were gradually established  Some falling into the Anabaptist opinions about and setting up a separate meeting gave both the churches and magistrates no small trouble and loaded them with plenty of contempt Some of the Quakers arriving from England in were still more troublesome nor could the cutting off of their ears or banishment restrain their seditious conduct Two of them were put to death on account of their obstinate refusal to comply with their sentence of banishment This drew upon the magistrates a torrent of obloquy and obliged them to publish a vindication of themselves which was not universally approved The magistrates therefore resolved to execute no more of the turbulent Quakers but to whip them as vagabonds out of their jurisdiction K Charles also transmitted an order in that put an end to the prosecution of Quakers for their public blasphemies and profanities such as women's running naked through the streets or into assemblies met for worship and abusing and threatening magistrates  c  As the ministers baptized none but the children of their own members many children of such as had not joined themselves to any church remained unbaptized there arose a warm debate Whether children had a right to baptism by their grandparents being church members though their immediate parents  had never entered into communion A Synod met by order of the magistrates to consider this question They were mostly of opinion That the children of church members are under the care and government of the church and liable to her censures though not admittable to the Lord's supper or to have their children baptized till they have solemnly joined themselves to the church but if they appeared to have been properly qualified but were hindered by death or some other extraordinary providence from publicly joining themselves to a church their children were to be baptized This decision was not a little opposed especially by Davenport who succeeded the pious and peaceable Mr Wilson at Boston In this same year fourteen ministers who had been driven from their charges in England came over hither and laboured in the work of the Lord in place of those that had come over above twenty years before most of whom were now dead  An uncommon meteor in the form of a spear and some other incidents stirred up the magistrates in to issue an exhortatory letter to the ministers begging of them to be more and more diligent in their visitation of families and in training up of the youthwhich by the blessing of God proved effectual for the restraining of vice and immorality and for keeping alive the dying power of religion among the rising generation The severity of the magistrates against the Anabaptists who had gathered one church at Boston and another at Swanzey drew a remonstratory letter from Drs Goodwin Owen and eleven others of the Independent clergy in England but it had but little effect Some few of the Quakers being punished for their disorderly practices their  friends  in England presented a Remonstrance to the king and parliament in which they without any regard to truth exceedingly aggravated their sufferings Eleven of the principal Presbyterian Independent and Anabaptist ministers  also wrote a letter to a minister of Boston in their favour After all the Quakers then and since had no reason to complain of severities but what they drew upon themselves by refusing to pay the fines imposed for not attending the military exercises on four training days a year with arms and ammunition or not assisting in the military watches kept in the towns or not paying the stipends annexed to the estates which they held They wanted to enjoy the protection of government but refused to do any thing for the support of it  For about forty years the people of New England had met with little disturbance from their Indian neighbours but at last in a most bloody war with Philip king of the Wompanoags commenced and continued almost two years till Philip was betrayed and killed In this war the Christianized Indians proved remarkably faithful in assisting the English No sooner was the war ended than the people gave over their solemnities of fasting and prayer and many began to grow intolerably licentious in their moralsPride intemperance swearing Sabbath breaking and covetousness came to an uncommon height The general court of the Massachusetts called a Synod to meet at Boston for preventing the further growth of this impiety and profaneness They agreed That ministers and magistrates in their different stations should labour to their utmost in order to reform the country from these vices and they recognized and confirmed their forementioned  Platform of church discipline  After NewHampshire had been separated from the Massachusetts by the influence of one Mason who quickly employed in his new government persons mean base or of desperate fortunes who assisted him in oppressing the people king Charles in took their charters from the colonies of Massachusett Plymouth and Connecticut while that of RhodeIsland peaceably submitted to his pleasure Thus the whole country had their antient constitution  destroyed and was made absolutely dependent on the crown of England This with another Indian war of ten or rather fourteen years continuance and the cruel oppressions of Ardross their governor brought the country to the brink of ruin But king William coming to the British throne the people took arms against their oppressors and got themselves reestablished in their wonted privileges excepting that the king in their new charter reserved for himself the appointment of their principal governors and for his governor the whole power of the militia and of appointing justices and sheriffs with the consent of his council together with a negative upon all laws elections and acts of government of the general assembly and counciland all laws made by the general assembly and approved by the governor were to be transmitted to his majesty for his approbation The colonies were far from being pleased with these encroachments on their liberties but judged it best to submit About the same time their ministers of the Independent and Presbyterian persuasions having considered the  articles of agreement  between their English brethren of these denominations in adopted the same and have ever since lived together in considerable peace and friendship upon the footing thereof  Dreadful was the distress of New England in for while the French and Indians were ravaging the frontiers the inhabitants were hanging one another for suspected witchcrafts and sorceries The daughter and niece of the reverend Mr Paris of Salem girls about ten years of age suddenly began to play unaccountable pranks and to fall into convulsion fits and to be struck dumb and have their mouth and limbs strangely distorted and to complain of being bitten and pinched by invisible agents and particularly of being pinched pricked and tormented by an Indian woman that lived in the house and two other women in the town As the physicians could not account for the distemper it was soon blazed abroad  that they were bewitched and Mr Paris kept several days of fasting and prayer on their account The women accused were called before the magistrate examined and imprisoned The Indian frightened out of her wits and forcibly instigated by her master confessed herself to be guilty and accused the other women as her partners in the witchcraft The contagion like a pestilence spread thro' several parts of the province till the prisons could scarcely contain the number of the  accused  The  afflicted  had their bodies horribly distortedpinched black and blueblisters raised upon them or pins run into them They pretended to see the shapes of the persons who tormented them while others around did not Probably part of these afflicting appearances were counterfeited but I cannot possibly conceive how they all could be so or produced by natural causes The witnesses deponed many odd things respecting the  accused  As they that confessed themselves  witches  or  wizards  and accused others were ordinarily spared no doubt severals were hereby as well as by the confounding tediousness of their examinations and sometimes tortures led to confess themselves guilty when they were not An assembly of ministers summoned by the governor in June declared themselves of opinion That considering the power and craft of Satan apparitions of persons afflicting others or alterations made on the afflicted by a look or touch of the accused were no proofs of their being witches and that a good name obtained by a good life ought not to be forfeited by mere  spectral  accusationsbut this declaration was too little regarded Twentyeight were condemned to death and nineteen of them executed all of whom died protesting their innocence  The number of the  confessing witches  who accused others to save themselves now amounting to fifty and the  afflicted  overdoing their part people began to fear every one for himself and his friends They who had a little before been in danger of being  torn to pieces by the mob or had been put to death especially such as had died with remarkable appearances of seriousness were universally pitied Prosecutions were stopped and about relieved from their imprisonment One of the judges and the twelve jurymen publicly acknowledged their mistake in the prosecution Mr Paris who had begun and zealously promoted it acknowledged his sin and begged pardon of God and men but nothing less than his removal from them would satisfy his congregation It was certainly faulty that the  accusers  were not strictly tried and brought to condign punishment  Since the beginning of this century except as to a gradual decay of the power and even of the appearances of religion the church in New England has continued on much the same footing Independents connected with half Presbyterians compose their established church but Episcopalians Anabaptists and Quakers are freely tolerated By the ministrations of Messrs Jonathan Edwards George Whitefield Gilbert Tennent and others very remarkable impressions were made on the souls and even on the bodies of multitudes in and This many highly extolled as an extraordinary work of the Spirit of God while others decried it as a delusion of Satan It is certain that the imprudence and error of some of the ministers and especially of the illiterate exhorters who promoted it and their rash censures of others and their pretences to visions prophecy and absolute perfection in holiness and other extravaganciesand the sudden return of multitudes of the subjects of these impressions to th  ir wonted or greater abominations tended much to  essen the credit of it The truly great Mr Edwards seems to have been at last convinced that th  re was a sad mixture of delusion incorporated with or joined to it At present I do not know that the state of the church in New England is much preferable to that in Britain About the province  of Massachusett contained about English congregations and Indian onesof all which not above three or four followed the forms of the English churchAnother revival of religion is said to have taken place in it of late There are about seven or eight hundred churches in New England of which thirtysix are Episcopalian and not a few Presbyterian  The province of NEW YORK continued in the hands of the Dutch from A D to when the English took it from them About king James gave order for admission of the French missionaries from Canada into it in order to convert the inhabitants to Popery But Dungan the Popish governor perceiving that these missionaries would decoy the people into the French interest commanded them to leave the country Since which tho' that of the church of England hath had a sort of establishment yet not only the Dutch and Swedes who continued in the country but all others except Papists have been here tolerated in the free exercise of their religion whether Lutherans Calvinists Presbyterians Independents Baptists  c  NEW JERSEY was taken from the Dutch about the same time with New York James duke of York being constituted principal proprietor perhaps for a trial of what might be expected from his like conduct in Britainindulged if he did not encourage Papists rigid Episcopalians Quakers Presbyterians Independents and Baptists to become proprietors and settlers in it Notwithstanding the encouragement given to the Episcopalians from England the far greater part continued to profess themselves of the other denominations while the Dutch and Swedes persevered in their own forms  PENNSYLVANIA so called from PENN the famous Quaker to whom king Charles granted it in hath all along had Quakerism for its established religion as the greatest part of the inhabitants at least of the proprietors have professed their adherence  to that But to invite others to settle among them PENN and his council made it the first fundamental article of their constitution That every man should have an unlimited freedom to worship God in what manner he thought best providing that he did not disturb or injure his neighbours in their civil property Hence Lutherans from Sweden and Germany Dutch and Scotch Presbyterians Independents Moravians Episcopaliansand Dunkards whose men and women live in separate communities much like the Popish monks and nuns but in a much more decent laborious simple and inoffensive manner have all their full liberty The Episcopalians have not many churches here but it is said that some of their congregations particularly that in Philadelphia is exceedingly large It is said that Presbyterians have near congregations in this country Near to Philadelphia is the flourishing college of New Jersey of which Davis Dickinson Burr Edwards  c  have been the respectable presidents  MARYLAND began to be possessed by Lord Baltimore and his Popish friends from Britain about Hence many of the inhabitants continued adhering to the Romish church His successor in got the assembly of the province to enact That Christians of every denomination should be allowed the free exercise of their own religion But by a division of the province in into thirty parishes sixteen of which were settled with Episcopalian clergy from England and by Dr Bray's transmitting thither a number of practical Protestant books the Prelatica  party became the most powerful and a kind of established church  VIRGINIA had its plantation with English begun by Sir Walter Raleigh about It had its name from Queen Elizabeth but has alway made a poor figure in religion About forty years ago it was divided into parishes of the form of the church of England and had only two Presbyterian and three Quaker meetings  CAROLINA about A D began to be peopled with some who had fled from the frontiers of Virginia and New England to avoid being massacred by the neighbouring savages These it is said drew over sundry of the natives to embrace the Christian religion In Lord Clarendon and some other Englishmen of rank obtained a grant of it from king Charles II As sundry of these were no friends to the English act of uniformity they to encourage people to settle on their lands agreed That dissenters should not there be obliged to approve or submit to the government or worship of the English church Locke who drew up the original constitutions for this province took care therein to secure full freedom not only for all scrupulous Protestants but even for Jews and heathens but meanwhile to require every one above seventeen years of age to join himself to some particular worshipping society under pain of forfeiting all the protection of law About the governor and his council enacted That none should be admitted into office without taking the  sacramental test  and  conforming to the English church  But such loud complaints of this imposition were transmitted to Queen Anne and her Lords that it was dropt as contrary to the original constitution of the colony About a colony of Swisse Protestants settled here as one of Scots had done sometime before and another of Vaudois did soon after About the same time also a number of the  twenty thousand  Saltzburgers who had left their own German dwellings to enjoy freedom of conscience settled here while others of them fixed their residence in Georgia All these after some contention with the Quakers and Episcopalians  c  lived peaceably together  GEORGIA did not begin to be occupied by the English till A D The first settlers were generally of the English church Messrs J Wesley and G Whitefield had charges here which they forsook and commenced itinerant preachers in Britain and America Dissenters of every denomination  have had much the same freedom here as in other coloniesIt is said that archbishop Secker had formed a plan to bring all these colonies under the yoke of the English church but his death and the late war prevented it Mr Whitefield's Orphan House is now a thriving seminary of learningin which and the Episcopalian colleges of Virginia and New York not a few are educated in the liberal sciences but for ought I know divinity is much overlooked  In these parts which still pertain to Britain Popery is properly the established religion in CANADA The French inhabitants of NOVA SCOTIA still adhere to their Popish idolatries while the Protestants are allowed to choose their ministers of any denomination they please The ISLANDS or WEST INDIES are under the inspection of the bishop of London as most of the English provinces of America lately were But I cannot find that the bulk of the inhabitants deserve to be ranked in any denomination of Christians any more than those pertaining to Britain in the East IndiesNay their ignorance of and inattention to every spiritual and eternal concerntheir atheistical neglect of God's worship and profanation of his name and Sabbaththeir whoredom and other uncleannesstheir robbery murder and cruel enslaving especially of the poor heathensrender the most of them a disgrace to human nature  THE British Parliament had scarcely established the  Antichristian  abominations in their lately conquered province of CANADA when God began to tear from them THIRTEEN of those American provinces which they had formerly governed and which contain about  three millions  of inhabitants Having procured their Independence by  Antichristian  assistance these provinces in their new  Constitutions  of government have generally placed Jesus Christ and his adversary the devil on an equal footing in giving the same establishment to the delutions errors  blasphemies superstitions and idolatries invented by the one as to the infinitely precious truths declared and the true worship of God appointed by the other Only the Constitution of the Massachusetts and of the two Carolinas appear to restrict their establishment to such things as these called Protestants have adopted under the notion or religious sentiments or practices and merely to tolerate Papists  c  About both Seceders and Old Dissenters in consequence of repeated applications began to send their respective missionaries to America which issued in the settlement of a considerable number of their ministers there particularly in the province  of New York Jerseys and Pennsylvania After these had long acted in three separate communions answerable to the state of their connexions in Britain they having observed that their subjection to judicatures in Britain did rather involve them in dry local controversies which were improper to affect the communion of saints in America if any where especially after its becoming independent on the civil government of Britain than do them any service did in agree to unite in one body under one Synod on the following terms  viz  That they should cleave to the Westminster Confession of Faith Larger and Shorter Catechisms Directory for worship and Form of church government as their  ecclesiastical standards  except that they left these articles in the Confession which respect  magistrates power about religious matters  to a future candid examination that they approved the British COVENANTS of their fathers with God and with one another and all other regular contendings and testimonies to the truths of Christ in the present and preceding ages and resolve to prosecute the ends therefore as far as their circumstances allow that while they continue to honour their brethren in Britain and Ireland they resolve to drop all disputes relative to burgess oaths in Scotland or requisites to the legal  y of British  magistrates that their terms of fixed church fellowship shall be  soundness in the Christian faith submission to the government and discipline of the church and a holy conversation  and that none shall be either deposed or excommunicated but for gross errors or practical violations of God's law that though for preventing disorderly confusions it be requisite that they use great caution with respect to occasional communion with these Christians that are not embodied with them yet they reckon it their duty to treat the godly of other denominations with great attention and tendernessand particularly to be very cautious in admitting either persons or societies which had belonged to their fellow Presbyterians in the country to any fixed communion with them  They have since composed a FORMULA of questions to be put to ministers elders and deacons at their ordination to their office in answering which they must declare their approbation of their above mentioned  constitutional articles  which are to be alway read on such occasionsand promise te adhere thereto in opposition to all Deistical Popish Arian Socinian Arminian Neonomian and Sectarian and other errors which are contrary to sound doctrine and the power of godlinessthat they will meekly submit to the admonitions of brethren and not follow any divisive courses either by complying with the defections of the times or giving up themselves to a detestable neutrality in the cause of Godthat zeal for the glory of God and the edification of souls are their principal motives inducing them to accept their officethat they hava used no undue methods to procure their call to itthat they will study an holy and exemplary conversation in their personal family and official conductand that they will faithfully and diligently perform all the duties pertaining to their respective offices  They have also enacted several Rules for the right ordering of their Synod Presbyteries and Sessions  THE END
