morn  When first I pluck'd thee from the thorn  With matchless blushes dy'd  Why should thy charming beauties fade  Which in the morning thou display'd  In all thy infant pride  Where are thy vary'd colours fled  Thy scent is gone thy leaves are dead  Alas I've lost my rose  Where are thy heav'nly beauties laid  When winter kills each verdant blade  With cold and chilling snows  RECITATIVE  Sweet rose adieu thy emblem is too plain  Thy youth gave pleasure but thy death gives pain  Ye dear remaining few I yet will strive  To keep your crimsontinted dyes alive  Before the thirsty sun your buds shall kill  My watervase a thousand times I'll fill  For your sweet sakes a thousand turns I'll bring  And rob each crystal brook and cooling spring  Ex with a wateringvase  Enter FLORIMORE  Bewitching maid thou hast ensnar'd my heart  And I must 'gin to play the lover's part  To ease the pleasing pain which now I feel  I'll try by some device her heart to steal  But then the curse of being laugh'd to scorn  When I have fix'd on one so lowly born  SONG  A plague on degree for I find I'm in love  And I will indulge the dear flame  What fool of degree would that passion remove  For the sake of a paltry name  E'en Jove on his fairmortal maidens hath smil'd  And gaz'd with an amorous eye  'Till his Godship at last found his heart was beguil'd  Then plague on it why shou'd not I  What's pomp or degree without freedom of mind  They serve but our bliss to annoy  Then I'll even venture shou'd I but once find  Young Cupid a generous boy  RECITATIVE  But let me pausemethinks it wou'd be wise  To try my little charmer in disguise  A Pedlar I'll assume with trinkets rare  And that way try the passion of my fair  Exit  Reenter ARABELLA  Plague on that old mamma of mine I say  I've sometimes half a mind to run away  Where'er I want to go whate'er to see  She's sure to knit her brows and hinder me  Who wou'd like me this prison'd life endure  And live for ever in a state obscure  SONG  From morn to night alone I sit  For liberty I sigh and fret  Like Robin in his cage  Mamma she kills me with her care  She tells me I am young and fair  At a bewitching age  No gay assembly must I see  She says such things will ruin me  That men are false and vain  But she is old and full of spleen  Were she like me at gay sixteen  She'd sing another strain  Enter SOPHORINA  RECITATIVE  SOPHORINA  Why look'st thou grave my girl I've news to tell  Will make thee smileI know 'twill please thee well  Thou hast a pris'ner ta'en  ARABELLA  A pris'ner How  SOPHORINA  Oh heed not that he is thy pris'ner now  He sighs protests and swears that he'll be kind  There ne'er was man so suited to thy mind  Yet ere he takes the bliss for which he sues  He must be bound in Hymen's silken noose  ARABELLA  Alas I've been myself confin'd too long  To wish another half so great a wrong  SONG  SOPHORINA  Foolish wench thou soon shalt find  I've got a plaything to thy mind  Leave thy pouting  And thy glouting  Throw thy foolish fears away  If thou too long hast been confin'd  I'll soon release and soon will bind  I come to teaze thee  And to please thee  And to fix thy weddingday  RECITATIVE  ARABELLA  My weddingday alas with whom and when  SOPHORINA  With one the bravest of all gentlemen  So tall he is so gallant and so gay  He'd steal the heart of any saint away  ARABELLA  How can my bosom to a stranger yield  How can he love the maid he ne'er beheld  SOPHORINA  Behold he comes himself to tell his tale  ARABELLA  And if he talks of love to me he'll fail  If that's the man he'll ne'er my passion move  He is already with himself in love  See how he views his person in the glass  Indeed mamma I think your man's an ass  Enter BARBARINO  BARBARINO  O yes by Jove aye there she is I see  The little huzzy is in love with me  What shall I say tho' now we're brought together  We'll 'gin at first to talk about the weather  Goodmorrow Miss it is a charming day  ARABELLA  Ah very very true Sir as you say  Pray tell me Sir how came it first about  That you should find the mighty secret out  BARBARINO  Pray tell me pretty little smiling dove  Will you not listen to a man in love  To one that loves you dearly  ARABELLA  No not I  BARBARINO  Then wou'd you wish to see your lover die  ARABELLA  With all my heart Sir die what way you choose  Or hang yourselfI'll not untie the noose  BARBARINO  O cruel  SOPHORINA  Impertinent and hateful  There ne'er was sure a baggage so ungrateful  You'll raise my blood you'll put me in a passion  To see how you can use a man of fashion  BARBARINO  I much do wonder Madam as you say  SOPHORINA  But I will make the saucy jade obey  BARBARINO  And so wou'd I indeed were I but you  I'd make her answer as she ought to do  I ne'er was us'd so strangely in my life  I wou'd not bear this usage from a wife  SONG  'Tis mighty fine  Were she but mine  I'd make her love  Whom I approve  Or else she soon should find  If she deny'd  Thro' prudish pride  Shou'd she refuse  Whom I shou'd chuse  She ne'er shou'd see mankind  RECITATIVE  SOPHORINA  Ungrateful minx how dare you use me thus  ARABELLA  Dear heart mamma you make a mighty fuss  SOPHORINA  As you did saucy gipsy ev'ry day  Have you not teaz'd me for a husband pray  Have you not told me you wou'd fain be free  And wish'd to marry for your liberty  ARABELLA  What must I do  SOPHORINA  Why can't you understand  Consent to give this gentleman your hand  Ah you're a foolish aggravating jade  Give him your hand and then your fortune's made  Aside to Arabella  Enter FLORIMORE as a Pedlar  FLORIMORE  God bless ye all my worthy gentry  I'm come to sell if you will please to buy  I've buttons studs and egrets for the hair  And many things beside all choice and rare  BARBARINO  Pray saucy fellow take yourself away  ARABELLA  No no good master prithee prithee stay  SOPHORINA  I'll tell you what my friend 'tween you and I  I'd have you go to those who mean to buy  You'd better take my counsel for I fear  You'll meet with very little custom here  FLORIMORE  Whether my Lady buys or shou'd she not  She's welcome ma'am to look at what I've got  Arabella takes the box and over looks it  SONG  I've earings of the best  All made of polish'd paste  I've boxes fine as gold  No better e'er were sold  Etwees all curious wrought  No better e'er were bought  All cheap as cheap can be  Pray Lady buy of me  RECITATIVE  SOPHORINA  I tell you man we've something else to do  Than talk all day about your toys and you  BARBARINO  Dear Arabella your consent I pray  ARABELLA  You have it Sirto take yourself away  BARBARINO  Then you're resolved for ever to refuse  ARABELLA  Pray good mamma what earings shall I chuse  SOPHORINA  A fig o'th' earings pray ma'am give your answer  ARABELLA  I'll love indeed as soon as e'er I can Sir  But to speak plainly first 'tween you and me  I fear that time will never never be  FLORIMORE  O well reply'd by heaven she has wit  And what's more rare she well can manage it  Aside  SOPHORINA  Then since you're so perverse the devil take me  Thou shalt consent to marry or I'll make thee  ARABELLA  I wou'd in all respects my duty fill  But ne'er will marry one against my will  SONG  'Tis in vain Sir to pursue me  Marriage this way will undo me  I'd rather live confin'd  I'd rather be confin'd for life  Than this way yield to be a wife  To break my peace of mind  BARBARINO  Such treatment is not to be borne  For my love she returns me her scorn  SOPHORINA  A jade I cou'd tear out her eyes  To see her effect to despise  A person of your high degree  FLORIMORE  'Tis excellent pastime to me  ARABELLA  I'll never no never comply  I'd sooner feed hogs in a stye  SOPHORINA  You huzzy you shall  ARABELLA  But I wont  SOPHORINA  You shall feed the hogs if you don't  BARBARINO  Odds heart what a pother is here  FLORIMORE  'Tis a pother which I like to hear  Aside  SOPHORINA  Come give him your hand and ha' done  ARABELLA  I'll take to my heels first and run  SOPHORINA  Get home and be lock'd up for life  ARABELLA  I'd rather be so than his wife  So I'll take your good counsel and go  SOPHORINA  Was ever a mother us'd so  Ex omnes  END OF THE FIRST PART  PART II  Enter ARABELLA  GENTLE Pedlar I could love thee  Were I not so much above thee  So kind he gives and speaks so mild  He has my heart almost beguil'd  His cheeks are of the rose's dye  Like pearl his teeth like jet his eye  O gentle Pedlar 'tis a shame  Thou art not worth a better name  Enter SOPHORINA and BARBARINO the latter yet unseen by ARABELLA  RECITATIVE  SOPHORINA  Well Arabella do you persevere  Will you ne'er lend a charitable ear  Your gentle lover I'm afraid will die  BARBARINO  But not of love good mother no not I  Aside  ARABELLA  I wish mamma you'd say no more about him  I shall be better off indeed without him  If he's in love I pity him I'm sure  Tho' pity seldom will a lover cure  But yet mamma indeed 'tween you and I  I've got another lover in my eye  BARBARINO  rushing forward    Another lover this is worse and worse  Oh I cou'd burst with storm cou'd swear cou'd curse  My jealousy with fury now encreases  I'll tear this newfound lover all to pieces  ARABELLA  Oh mercy on us what a dreadful creature  If he'd a wife he certainly would eat her  But were you once my newfound spark to see  You wou'd adore the rogue as well as me  SONG  BARBARINO  Was ever mortal man so treated  What in my love to be defeated  Oh let me but lay hold of him  I'll tear the traitor limb from limb  I'd rather met with death I swear  Than once the name of rival hear  Yes I'd adore him you shou'd find  I'd strew his limbs before the wind  RECITATIVE  ARABELLA  Then here behold the dear bewitching thing  Behold your rival in this sparkling ring  BARBARINO  And am I then at last so much despis'd  As by a gaudy ring to be outpris'd  SOPHORINA  A ring for heaven's sake how came you by it  ARABELLA  I had it given me ma'am I don't deny it  SOPHORINA  By whom by whom pray tell me Miss and when  ARABELLA  By one the humblest of all humble men  And lo he comes in hopes you'll something buy  Some necklace earing or some rarity  Enter FLORIMORE  SOPHORINA  Pray tell me worthy friend how is't you live  Is it by what you sell or what you give  FLORIMORE  To those in whom civility I meet  It is my fancy oftentimes to treat  To those I do not love perhaps so well  To such I neither care to give or sell  BARBARINO  This fellow's some imposture you will find  The country swarms with numbers of his kind  I'd not receive the favour of a pin  He only gives away to take you in  SOPHORINA  Return the ring and let the villain go  Nay he may be a thief for ought you know  FLORIMORE  Dear Lady judge not hardly of me pray  SOPHORINA  Then take yourself and trumpery away  SONG  FLORIMORE  O 'tis cruel thus to judge me  And without the least offence  You'll surely not the time begrudge me  While I prove my innocence  I came to steal indeed 'tis true  A jewel which belongs to you  For which I'd give my heart  Then lovely maiden interfere  And stand a poor man's friend  Thou art the jewel I revere  I seek no other end  But I'm I fear by much too rude  A poor man never shou'd intrude  Take this and I'll depart  gives her a diamond necklace  BARBARINO  Presumptious fellow know you were you've got  FLORIMORE  Pray good gentleman be not so hot  BARBARINO  How dare such knaves as you to talk of love  FLORIMORE  Because 'twas taught me by the gods above  BARBARINO  You talk too free methinks 'tween you and I  FLORIMORE  I thought your question wanted a reply    Barbarino  whispers  Sophorina  Am I deceiv'd or is it truly so  Looking at  Barbarino  My vassal as I live my Barbarino  But I will still pursue this vagrant plan  To try my fair one and to know my man  Aside  SOPHORINO  I fear 'tis very true Sir what you say  To  Barbarino  We'd better send the saucy knave away  BARBARINO  Pray tell me fellow where you got those things  Those golden boxes diamonds and rings  FLORIMORE  I bought 'em  BARBARINO  Stole 'em if you please  Come Sir confess and down upon your knees  FLORIMORE  Excuse me Sir I've always made a rule  Never to make confession to a fool  BARBARINO  Death and veng'ance shall I bear all this  If you'll return the knave his necklace Miss  You soon shall see how I will treat the slave  I'll slay the thief and make yon ditch his grave  ARABELLA  For what pray Sir what has the poor man done  SOPHORINA  What do you take his part then we're undone  ARABELLA  Indeed mamma I do indeed I will  For I believe the Pedlar honest still  His looks the name of villain must reprove  For they are all humility and love  BARBARINO  Immortal Cupid this is mighty fine  SOPHORINA  She cannot be a daughter sure of mine  A Pedlarman is that your taste you jade  Pedlar indeed oh me I shall go mad  SONG  Get out you sleekeyheaded hound  What Devil sent you here  Alas alas my head turns round  I shall go mad I fear  Take take your trinket baits away  Nor dare to dark my door  I'll have you hang'dmind what I say  If here you venture more  RECITATIVE  FLORIMORE  My tender lovely maid farewel adieu  I'll go myself but leave my heart with you  But ere I go this di'mond locket take  And wear it dear one for a Pedlar's sake  To  Arabella  ARABELLA  Stay stay my gentle Pedlar prithee stay  For I cou'd listen to thee all the day  What Pedlar ever talk'd in such a strain  Come back dear friend and talk to me again  'Tis not the jewel which so much I prize  It is the language of thy tongue and eyes  BARBARINO  Fire and brimstone I'll no more behold  Away get hence you saucy beggar bold  I'll put an end you villain to your rout  Good ma'am assist me and we'll hand him out  SOPHORINA  Aye that I will good Sir with all my heart  ARABELLA  Wou'd I a giant were to take his part    Barbarino  and  Sophorina  in struggling with  Florimore  they throw off his cloak and pull off his false hair and discover a star upon his breast  BARBARINO  Ye Gods my Lord my rival and my master  Did ever mortal meet with such disaster  Now what the Devil shall I do or say  The best way'll be I think to run away  Aside  FLORIMORE  Pray gentlefolks why are ye both so grave  I thought you wou'd have made yon ditch my grave  Perhaps you've chang'd your minds  SOPHORINA  Oh lack a day  We're both confoundedand have nought to say    Florimore  makes affectionate signs to  Arabella  SONG  BARBARINO  O pardon what is past my Lord  I'll never no upon my word  I'll ne'er do so again  O let this shameful scene pass by  And for the future I will try  To wipe away the stain  SOPHORINA  O mercy how I quake and tremble  How cou'd your Lordship so dissemble  And feign your part so well  I hope your Lordship will forgive me  It was your pleasure to deceive me  Your own love tale to tell  RECITATIVE  FLORIMORE  Tis all forgot but for the sake of me  Use other Pedlars with more charity  I trust you'll never more yourself expose  Nor act the lover in your master's clothes  To  Barbarino  SOPHORINA  I wish him hang'd my Lord if you'll believe me  Because the villain strove so to deceive me  FLORIMORE  Then since you seem so truly to repent  To make amends now give me your consent  To wear this lovely charmer by my side  I wish to make the matchless maid my bride  SOPHORINA  Your bride my Lord I'm all surprise and wonder  You've my consentbut make her knuckle under  Dear Arabella who e'er thought to see  Thee stand so fair a chance for quality  FLORIMORE  And now fair maid it does on you depend  To give this comic scene a happy end  To  Arabella  ARABELLA  Give your instructions I will nought deny  That may befit a maiden's modesty  FLORIMORE  'Tis fairly spoke now yield me that fair hand  ARABELLA  You have it gentle Lord upon demand  Were't but my hand the gift were mean and poor  Had you not archly stole my heart before  FLORIMORE  Celestial maid thou'st hush'd each doubt and fear  Was ever maid so lovely and sincere  In thy dear arms I'll seek eternal rest  And lull my cares to sleep upon thy breast  SONG  Let smiling Cupids weave a crown  Young Hymen's brows to bind  Then make this matchless maid my own  The fairest of her kind  ARABELLA  Her hateful head let Envy hide  Whilst I my joys confess  There never sure was yet a bride  Felt equal happiness  BOTH  Ye mighty Gods I ask no more  I've got the maid man that I adore  SOPHORINA  Let happiness on both attend  And may your joys ne'er know an end  BARBARINO  Come let us all then join
