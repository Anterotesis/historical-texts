BRISTOL  THE Bath road is measured from Hyde Park corner On the right as we leave London is Hyde Park a park belonging to the crown it is much frequented by those who wish to take the air either on foot on horseback or in carriages In fine weather it is generally crowded from two o'clock in the afternoon till five  The first village that occurs as soon as we are through the turnpikegate is Knightsbridge On entering this place opposite the Park wall stands St George's Hospital an endowment for sick and lame A little beyond this the road falls off on the left to Chelsea and Fulhambridge  About half a mile from the gate on the right going out of Knightsbridge is a new building stand∣ing within the Park wall built as barracks for the soldiery  About two miles from town is the village of Kensington on the right as you enter it is one of the King's palaces the gardens to which are laid out in lawn and shrubbery and kept in good order and are open certain hours of the day for people to walk in  This spot was formerly the seat of the Veres an∣cestors of the Earls of Oxford to whom it was given by William the Conqueror it afterwards fell into the possession of Lord Chancellor Finch Earl of Nottingham and was from him purchased by William III who built the palace It has been the temporary residence of successive Kings and Queens of England from William III to George II who died there  Going out of Kensington on the right on an eminence stands Camden House once a noble re∣treat now a boarding school for young ladies  The next house on the right whose grounds ad∣join Camden

Near the three mile stone we enter Hammer∣smith a long and straggling village in which lives a little to the left near the church the Margrave of Anspach  A little beyond the four mile stone is Turnham green on the entrance to this place the road turns off on the left to Chiswick a pleasant village within a mile on the banks of the Thames near which is a small house built in the stile of an Ita∣lian villa by the late Lord Burlington now the property of the Duke of Devonshire  On the right at about half a mile distant but in view is a house called Gunnersbury House built by Mr Webb soninlaw to Inigo Jones it was the property and residence of the late Princess Amelia aunt to the present King  A little beyond this on the left stands Kew∣bridge crossing the Thames and leading to Kew Richmond c in the county of Surrey The road from London here as far Colnbrooke is in the county of Middlesex  We now enter the old town of Brentford which with the new town in continuance is more than a mile in length This town is poor dirty and straggling it stands on the banks of the Thames on the opposite shore of which are the beautiful and royal gardens of Kew and Richmond The seven mile stone stands at the corner of a street  leading into the road to Ealing and Uxbridge  Brentford is a market town and the county town where the members for the county are chosen on a building erected for the purpose behind the mar∣ket house Despicable as this town appears it  carries on a good trade with the metropolis by means of the river in corn malt and other com∣modities  In Charles I beat his enemies at this place and the Earl of Forth commander of the Kings forces was created Earl of Brentford which title became extinct at his death in  Passing the bridge as we leave the town on the

of George II and afterwards converted into a public house  From Smallborough Green we enter Hounslow  at the further end of which village the two great western roads fork off that on the right to Bath that on the left to Exeter and Cornwall There is a very good road to Bath through Andover or the Exe∣ter road not more than one or two miles out of the way which is fully compensated by avoiding the hills between Marlborough and Devizes and the high charges at the different inns on what is called the Bath road which is the road most fre∣quented  Just beyond the mile stone on the left are  the new barracks for the soldiers Hounslow Heath is a dead flat of great extent and having no va∣riety we have as little to say respecting it  Twelve miles and a half from London a rivulet  called the Crane

city of Somersetshire its hot springs are said to have been discovered years before Christ by Bladud from Brute It is allowed to have been formerly a very extensive city and to have been first reduced by the Romans about the year  Bath is seated in a very fertile vale on the banks of the river Avon and surrounded by hills so as to be a very close warm place particularly in sum∣mer From the bowels of these hills is dug that beautiful freestone made use in building the city Its increase within the last years has been great and quick from a small contracted town it has extended itself into open streets and squares with other elegant buildings in various forms the whole making a city of considerable magnitude so as to ascend almost to the summit of the hills about it and new works are still going on  The heat of the waters in the different baths are as follow according to Farenheit's Thermometer The water in the King's bath raises the mercury in its coldest place to degrees in its hottest to degrees The hot bath exceeds this by some degrees the degrees of heat in the Cross bath is and in the Queen's bath  Ladies and Gentlemen assemble every morning from till to drink the waters

shoes and for the accommodation of going to the rooms dressed sedanchairs are always at hand for  d  or  s  The country round the city is embellished with gentlemens seats the most distinguished is Prior Park the seat of the late Ralph Allen  Lansdown overhangs the city and is renowned for a battle in the Civil Wars on July when the King's forces beat those of the Parliament A monument is erected on it in commendation of the abovementioned victory by George Lord Lansdown in  The river Avon has been made navigable from Bath to Bristol and makes the intercourse between them great There are two roads to Bristol the distance miles one called the Upper Road and the other the Lower The Upper runs from the west end of the city along the northern side of the river and through a part of Gloucestershire the Lower and the most frequented winds along the southern bank of the river from the old bridge  and a communication between these two roads is formed by a handsome stone bridge of one arch over the same river about two miles and a half be∣low the town  Passing then over the bridge the Lower Road  we soon reach Twiverton two miles from Bath and a little beyond the d milestone Newton a small town scattered along the side of a hill near  which on the south or left stands Newton Park the seat of George Langton Esq On the other side of the river on a high ridge stands a hand∣some house the residence of some of the family of the late Sir Caesar Hawkins who lived occasion∣ally here  The Vale of Bath through which the Avon runs is beautiful in all its parts and worth the travellers' notice  Proceeding on from Newton we leave the village  of Corstan on the left and pass through Saltford on the right of which on the Avon side are several  copper and brass mills Hence the road rises and we pass through a rich country towards Keynsham eight miles and a half from Bath  Before we reach Keynsham we see a handsome house on the north this belongs to Edward Lyne Esq  Keynsham is a small market town standing on two hills on the south bank of the Avon with a small bridge over the river Chew which runs by  it The counties of Glocester and Somerset are joined by a larger bridge over the Avon below the town  Keynsham Church is of Gothic structure and the high grounds beyond the town have a beautiful effect  Passing Keynsham the house on the right is Mr Butcher's  At Stanton Drew a few miles from Keynsham are the remains of a Druid Temple known by the name of  the Wedding  from a vulgar opinion that a bride and her attendants were changed into these stones This temple says Mr Wood consisted of three circles of stones and formed a model of the Pythagorean System of the planetary world  From Keynsham we descend into an enclosed woodland country leaving Keynsham Park on the  right beyond which we rise another hill and from the top about three miles from Bristol we have exten∣sive prospects here we pass a colliery  Between the nine and ten milestones the house on the right is Mr Weirs that on the left Mr Ire∣land's  From the abovementioned hill we descend to  Brislington and on our approach to Bristol a great number of handsome houses and villas lie scattered on both sides the road  Beyond Brislington we go down an avenue of  stately trees passing a fine sloping valley of rich  verdure on the left and a more cultivated country on the right and again passing many handsome  villas winding round a hill we get a full view of Bristol Beyond this the road rises to the city  A little beyond the milestone on the left is the high road to Wells  Bristol is miles from London through Bath but miles nearer through Chippenham and Marshfield it stands part in Somersetshire and part in Gloucestershire the two counties being divided by the river Avon  This city is a county within itself made so by Edward III and Henry VIII made it a bishop's see It has handsome squares and churches besides the cathedral which stands in Gloucester∣shire The church of St Mary Redcliff is worthy attention being the most beautiful structure of the kind in the kingdom its roof is a solid arch of freestone  Bristol sends two members to Parliament and is governed by a Mayor Recorder Aldermen two Sheriffs and Common Council  About a mile west of Bristol in Gloucestershire is the village of Clifton seated on the side of a high hill extending to the river Avon the resi∣dence of many persons of fortune It has a parade a square and other handsome buildings fitted up for the accommodation of those who resort here for pleasure or for health There are two assemblyrooms  for the amusement of the company on the plan of those at Bath  At the western extremity of Clifton near the lofty rock of St Vincent's rises the Bristol hot∣springs the heat of which by Fahrenheit's Ther∣mometer is degrees  THIS Description of the Road from London to Bath will serve to conduct the traveller from Bath to London if he reads it from the end to the be∣ginning and remembers that those places which in his way down to Bath were represented to be on the right of the road in his way back must be on the left and  vicé versa  THERE is a second road to Bath from London as I have observed to which I whould give the pre∣ference for many reasons In the first place it avoids the hills between Marlborough and Devizes and of course saves time upon the journey se∣condly being less frequented is not so dusty in summer or so much worn in winter thirdly a traveller is not so likely to be stopped by a run of postchaises or be obliged to go on with tired horses and lastly inns are not so expensive This road is through Staines Hart∣fordbridge Basingstoke Andover Luggershal  Everley and Devizes To Bath this way is one mile more but the advantages more than com∣pensate it the country is equally beaut  f  l If we travel it in autumn we pass throu  h Weyhill Fair the greatest in the kingdom and if we would dis∣pense with a mile or two more on our journey and go through Ambresbury instead of Everley and Devizes the road is good and we pass close by that superb piece of antiquity the Druidical Tem∣ple of Stonehenge which every person of taste and curiosity goes to see and the road this way is not above two or three miles round  I know the Bath road through Reading has been admired for the good accommodations met with at the different inns but all inns are now improved and there are none that excel  Demesay's  at Hart∣fordbridge and some others on the way indeed the accommodations at  Demesay's  are so excellent that the Royal Family sensible of it make a point always of dining or supping there in their journey to and from Weymouth  If the traveller let him be of what cast he will wishes to be amused on his journey or at Bath  Dr Trusler  ventures to recommend to his perusal the two following books they will afford him a fund of entertainment being full of laughable anecdote and make him acquainted with the arts finesse and
