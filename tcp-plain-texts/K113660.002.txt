 THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD A TALE Supposed to be written by HIMSELF  Sperate miseri cavete faelices  VOL II  SALISBURY Printed by B COLLINS For F NEWBERY in PaterNosterRow London MDCCLXVI  CHAP I  The history of a philosophic vagabond pursuing novelty but losing content  AFTER we had supped Mrs Arnold politely offered to send a couple of her footmen for my son's baggage which he at first seemed to decline but upon her pressing the request he was obliged to inform her that a stick and a wallet were all the moveable things upon this earth that he could boast of  "Why aye my son"  cried I  "you left me but poor and poor I find you are come back and yet I make no doubt you have seen a great deal of the world"    "Yes Sir"  replied my son  "but travelling after fortune is not the way to secure  her and indeed of late I have desisted from the pursuit"    "I fancy Sir"  cried Mrs Arnold  "that the account of your adventures would be amusing the first part of them I have often heard from my niece but could the company prevail for the rest it would be an additional obligation"    "Madam"  replied my son  "I can promise you the pleasure you have in hearing will not be half so great as my vanity in the recital and yet in the whole narrative I can scarce promise you one adventure as my account is not of what I did but what I saw The first misfortune of my life which you all know was great but tho' it distrest it could not sink me No person ever had a better knack at hoping than I The less kind I found fortune then the more I expected from her another time and being now at the bottom of her wheel every new revolution might lift but could not depress me I proceeded therefore towards London in a fine  morning no way uneasy about tomorrow but chearful as the birds that caroll'd by the road I comforted myself with various reflections that London was the true mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward  "Upon my arrival in town Sir my first care was to deliver your letter of recommendation to our cousin who was himself in little better circumstances than me My first scheme you know Sir was to be usher at an academy and I asked his advice on the affair Our cousin received the proposal with a true Sardonic grin Aye cried he this is a pretty career indeed that has been chalked out for you I have been once an usher at a boarding school myself and may I die by an anodyne necklace but I had rather be an under turnkey in Newgate I was up early and late I was browbeat by the master hated for my ugly face by the mistress  worried by the boys within and never permitted to stir out to meet civility abroad But are you sure you are fit for a school Let me examine you a little Have you been bred apprentice to the business No Then you won't do for a school Can you dress the boys hair No Then you won't do for a school Have you had the smallpox No Then you won't do for a school Can you lie three in a bed No Then you will never do for a school Have you got a good stomach Yes Then you will by no means do for a school No Sir if you are for a genteel easy profession bind yourself seven years as an apprentice to turn a cutler's wheel but avoid a school by any means But come continued he I see you are a lad of spirit and some learning what do you think of commencing author like me You have read in books no doubt of men of genius starving at the trade but at present I'll shew you forty very dull fellows  about town that live by it in opulence All honest jogg trotmen who go on smoothly and dully and write history and politics and are praised and who had they been bred coblers would all their lives have only mended shoes but never made them  "Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an usher I resolved to accept his proposal and having the highest respect for literature I hailed the antiqua mater of Grubstreet with reverence I thought it my glory to pursue a track which Dryden and Otway trod before me In fact I considered the goddess of this region as the parent of excellence and however an intercourse with the world might give us good sense the poverty she granted was the nurse of genius Big with these reflections I sate down and finding that the best things remained to be said on the wrong side I resolved to write  a book that should be wholly new I therefore drest up three paradoxes with some ingenuity They were false indeed but they were new The jewels of truth have been so often imported by others that nothing was left for me to import but some splendid things that at a distance looked every bit as well Witness you powers what fancied importance sate perched upon my quill while I was writing The whole learned world I made no doubt would rise to oppose my systems but then I was prepared to oppose the whole learned world Like the porcupine I sate self collected with a quill pointed against every opposer"  "Well said my boy"  cried I  "and what subject did you treat upon I hope you did not pass over the importance of Hierardical monogamy But I interrupt go on you published your paradoxes well and what did the learned world say to your paradoxes"  "Sir"  replied my son"  the learned world said nothing to my paradoxes nothing at all Sir Every man of them was employed in praising his friends and himself or condemning his enemies and unfortunately as I had neither I suffered the cruellest mortification" neglect  "As I was meditating one day in a coffeehouse on the fate of my paradoxes a little man happening to enter the room placed himself in the box before me and after some preliminary discourse finding me to be a scholar drew out a bundle of proposals begging me to subscribe to a new edition he was going to give the world of Propertius with notes This demand necessarily produced a reply that that I had no money and that concession led him on to enquire into the nature of my expectations Finding that my expectations were just as great as my purse I see cried he you are unacquainted  with the town I'll teach you a part of it Look at these proposals upon these very proposals I have subsisted very comfortably for twelve years The moment a nobleman returns from his travels a Creolian arrives from Jamaica or a dowager from her country seat I strike for a subscription I first besiege their hearts with flattery and then pour in my proposals at the breach If they subscribe readily the first time I renew my request to beg a dedication fee If they let me have that I smite them once more for engraving their coat of arms at the top Thus continued he I live by vanity and laugh at it But between ourselves I am now too well known I should be glad to borrow your face a a bit a nobleman of distinction has just returned from Italy my face is familiar to his porter but if you bring this copy of verses my life for it you succeed and we divide the spoil"  "Bless us George"  cried I  "and is that the employment of poets now Do men of their exalted talents thus stoop to beggary Can they so far disgrace their calling as to make a vile traffic of praise for bread"  "O no Sir"  returned he  "a true poet can never be so base for wherever there is genius there is pride The creatures I now describe are only beggars in rhyme The real poet as he braves every hardship for fame so he is equally a coward to contempt and none but those who are unworthy protection condescend to solicit it  "Having a mind too proud to stoop to such indignities and yet a fortune too humble to hazard a second attempt for fame I was now obliged to take a middle course and write for bread But I was unqualified for a profession where mere industry alone could ensure success  I could not suppress my lurking passion for applause but usually consumed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but little room when it should have been more advantageously employed in the diffusive productions of fruitful mediocrity My little piece would come forth in the mist of periodical publication unnoticed and unknown The public were more importantly employed than to observe the easy simplicity of my style or the harmony of my periods Sheet after sheet was thrown off to oblivion My essays were buried among the essays upon liberty eastern tales and cures for the bite of a mad dog while Philantos Philalethes Philelutheros and Philanthropos all wrote better because they wrote faster than I  "Now therefore I began to associate with none but disappointed authors like myself who praised deplored and despised each other The satisfaction we  found in every celebrated writer's attempts was inversely as their merits I found that no genius in another could please me My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of comfort I could neither read nor write with satisfaction for excellence in another was my aversion and writing was my trade  "In the midst of these gloomy reflections as I was one day sitting on a bench in St James's park a young gentleman of distinction who had been my intimate acquaintance at the university approached me We saluted each other with some hesitation he almost ashamed of being known to one who made so shabby an appearance and I afraid of a repulse But my suspicions soon vanished for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very goodnatured fellow"  "What did you say George"  interrupted I  "Thornhill was not that his name It can certainly be no other than my landlord"    "Bless me"  cried Mrs Arnold  "is Mr Thornhill so near a neighbour of yours He has long been a friend in our family and we expect a visit from him shortly"  "My friend's first care"  continued my son  "was to alter my appearance by a very fine suit of his own cloaths and then I was admitted to his table upon the footing of halffriend halfunderling My business was to attend him at auctions to put him in spirits when he sate for his picture to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another and to assist at tattering a kip as the phrase was when we had a mind for a frolic Beside this I had twenty other little employments in the family I was to do many small things without bidding to carry the cork screw to stand godfather  to all the butler's children to sing when I was bid to be never out of humour always to be humble and if I could to be happy  "In this honourable post however I was not without a rival A captain of marines who seemed formed for the place by nature opposed me in my patron's affections His mother had been laundress to a man of quality and thus he early acquired a taste for pimping and pedigree As this gentleman made it the study of his life to be acquainted with lords though he was dismissed from several for his stupidity yet he found many of them who permitted his assiduities being as dull as himself As flattery was his trade he practised it with the easiest address imaginable but it came aukward and stiff from me and as every day my patron's desire of flattery encreased so every hour being better acquainted with his defects I became more unwilling to give  it Thus I was once more fairly going to give up the field to the captain when my friend found occasion for my assistance This was nothing less than to fight a duel for him with a gentleman whose sister it was pretended he had used ill I readily complied with his request and tho' I see you are displeased at my conduct yet as it was a debt indispensably due to friendship I could not refuse I undertook the affair disarmed my antagonist and soon after had the pleasure of finding that the lady was only a woman of the town and the fellow her bully and a sharper This piece of service was repaid with the warmest professions of gratitude but as my friend was to leave town in a few days he knew no other method to serve me but by recommending me to his uncle Sir William Thornhill and another nobleman of great distinction who enjoyed a post under the government When he was gone my first care was to carry his recommendatory  letter to his uncle a man whose character for every virtue was universal yet just I was received by his servants with the most hospitable smiles for the looks of the domestics ever transmit their master's benevolence Being shewn into a grand apartment where Sir William soon came to me I delivered my message and letter which he read and after pausing some minutes Pray Sir cried he inform me what you have done for my kinsman to deserve this warm recommendation But I suppose Sir I guess at your merits you have fought for him and so you would expect a reward from me for being the instrument of his vices I wish sincerely wish that my present refusal may be some punishment for your guilt but still more that it may be some inducement to your repentanceThe severity of this rebuke I bore patiently because I knew it was just My whole expectations now therefore lay in my letter to the great man  As the doors of the nobility are almost ever beset with beggars all ready to thrust in some sly petition I found it no easy matter to gain admittance However after bribing the servants with half my worldly fortune I was at last shewn into a spacious apartment my letter being previously sent up for his lordship's inspection During this anxious interval I had full time to look round me Every thing was grand and of happy contrivance the paintings the furniture the gildings petrified me with awe and raised my idea of the owner Ah thought I to myself how very great must the possessor of all these things be who carries in his head the business of the state and whose house displays half the wealth of a kingdom sure his genius must be unfathomable During these awful reflections I heard a step come heavily forward Ah this is the great man himself No it was only a chambermaid Another foot was heard soon after This  must be He No it was only the great man's valet de chambre At last his lordship actually made his appearance Are you cried he the bearer of this here letter I answered with a bow I learn by this continued he as how thatBut just at that instant a servant delivered him a card and without taking farther notice he went out of the room and left me to digest my own happiness at leisure I saw no more of him till told by a footman that his lordship was going to his coach at the door Down I immediately followed and joined my voice to that of three or four more who came like me to petition for favours His lordship however went too fast for us and was gaining his Chariot door with large strides when I hallowed out to know if I was to have any reply He was by this time got in and muttered an answer half of which only I heard the other half was lost in the rattling of his chariot wheels I stood for some time with my neck  stretched out in the posture of one that was listening to catch the glorious sounds till looking round me I found myself alone at his lordship's gate  "My patience"  continued my son  "was now quite exhausted stung with the thousand indignities I had met with I was willing to cast myself away and only wanted the gulph to receive me I regarded myself as one of those vile things that nature designed should be thrown by into her lumber room there to perish in unpitied obscurity I had still however half a guinea left and of that I thought fortune herself should not deprive me but in order to be sure of this I was resolved to go instantly and spend it while I had it and then trust to occurrences for the rest As I was going along with this resolution it happened that Mr Cripse's office seemed invitingly open to give me a welcome reception In this office Mr Cripse kindly offers all his  majesty's subjects a generous promise of l a year for which promise all they give in return is their liberty for life and permission to let him transport them to America as slaves I was happy at finding a place where I could lose my fears in desperation and therefore entered this cell for it had the appearance of one being dark damp and dirty Here I found a number of poor creatures all in circumstances like myself expecting the arrival of Mr Cripse presenting a true epitome of English impatience Each untractable soul at variance with fortune wreaked her injuries on their own hearts but Mr Cripse at last came down and all our murmurs were hushed He deigned to regard me with an air of peculiar approbation and indeed he was the first man who for a month past talked to me with smiles After a few questions he found I was fit for every thing in the world He paused a while upon the properest means of providing for me  and slapping his forehead as if he had found it assured me that there was at that time an embassy talked of from the synod of Pensylvania to the Chickasaw Indians and that he would use his interest to get me made secretary I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied and yet his promise gave me pleasure there was something so magnisicent in the sound I fairly therefore divided my half guinea one half of which went to be added to his thirty thousand pound and with the other half I resolved to go to the next tavern to be there more happy than he  "As I was going out with that resolution I was met at the door by the captain of a ship with whom I had formerly some little acquaintance and he agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch As I never chose to make a secret of my circumstances he assured me that I was upon the very point of ruin in listening  to the officekeeper's promises for that he only designed to sell me to the plantations But continued he I fancy you might by a much shorter voyage be very easily put into a genteel way of bread Take my advice My ship sails tomorrow for Amsterdam What if you go in her as a passenger The moment you land all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen English and I'll warrant you'll get pupils and money enough I suppose you understand English added he by this time or the deuce is in it I confidently assured him of that but expressed a doubt whether the Dutch would be willing to learn English He affirmed with an oath that they were fond of it to distraction and upon that affirmation I agreed with his proposal and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch English in Holland The wind was fair our voyage short and after having paid my passage with half my moveables I found myself fallen as if from the skies a  stranger in one of the principal streets of Amsterdam In this situation I was unwilling to let any time pass unemployed in teaching I addressed myself therefore to two or three of those I met whose appearance seemed most promising but it was impossible to make ourselves mutually understood It was not till this very moment I recollected that in order to teach Dutchmen English it was necessary that they should first teach me Dutch How I came to overlook so obvious an objection is to me amazing but certain it is I overlooked it  "This scheme thus blown up I had some thoughts of fairly shipping back to England again but happening into company with an Irish student who was returning from Louvain our conversation turning upon topics of literature for by the way it may be observed that I always forgot the meanness of my circumstances when I could converse upon  such subjects from him I learned that there were not two men in his whole university who understood Greek This amazed me I instangly resolved to travel to Louvain and there live by teaching Greek and in this design I was heartened by my brother student who threw out some hints that a fortune might be got by it  "I set boldly forward the next morning Every day lessened the burthen of my moveables like Aesop and his basket of bread for I paid them for my lodgings to the Dutch as I travelled on When I came to Louvain I was resolved not to go sneaking to the lower professors but openly tendered my talents to the principal himself I went had admittance and offered him my service as a master of the Greek language which I had been told was a desideratum in his university The  principal  seemed at first to doubt of my abilities but of these I offered to  convince him by turning a part of any Greek author he should fix upon into Latin Finding me perfectly earnest in my proposal he addressed me thus You see me young man continued he I never learned Greek and I don't find that I ever missed it I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek and I eat heartily without Greek In short continued he I don't know Greek and I do not believe there is any use in it  "I was now too far from home to think of returning so I resolved to go forward I had some knowledge of music with a tolerable voice and now turned what was once my amusement into a present means of bare subsistence I passed among the harmless peasants of Flanders and among such of the French as were poor enough to be very merry for I  ever found them sprightly in proportion to their wants Whenever I approached a peasant's house towards nightfall I played one of my most merry tunes and that procured me not only a lodging but subsistence for the next day I once or twice attempted to play for people of fashion but they still thought my performance odious and never rewarded me even with a trifle This was to me the more extraordinary as whenever I used formerly to play for company when playing was my amusement my music never failed to throw them into raptures and the ladies especially but as it was now my only means it was received with contempt a proof how ready the world is to under rate those talents which a man lives by  "In this manner I proceeded to Paris with no design but just to look about me and then to go forward The people of  Paris are much fonder of strangers that have money than of those that have wit You may imagine then as I could not boast much of either that I was no great favourite After I had walked about the town four or five days and seen the outsides of the best houses I was preparing to leave this retreat of venal hospitality when passing through one of the principal streets whom should I meet but our cousin to whom you first recommended me This meeting was very agreeable to me and I believe not displeasing to him He enquired into the nature of my journey to Paris and informed me of his business there which was to collect pictures medals intaglios and antiques of all kinds for a gentleman in London who had just stept into taste and a large fortune I was still more surprised at seeing our cousin pitched upon for this office as himself had often assured me he knew nothing of the  matter Upon my asking how he had been taught the art of a connoscento so very suddenly he assured me that nothing was more easy The whole secret consisted in a strict adherence to two rules the one always to observe that the picture might have been better if the painter had taken more pains and the other to praise the works of Pietro Perugino But says he as I once taught you how to be an author in London I'll now undertake to instruct you in the art of picture buying at Paris  "With this proposal I very readily closed as it was a living and now all my ambition was to live I went therefore to his lodgings improved my dress by his assistance and after some time accompanied him to auctions of pictures where the English gentry were expected to be purchasers I was not a little surprised at his intimacy with people of the  best fashion who referred themselves to his judgment upon every picture or medal as to an unerring standard of taste He made very good use of my assistance upon these occasions for when asked his opinion he would gravely take me aside and ask mine shrug look wise return and assure the company that he could give no opinion upon an affair of so much importance Yet there was sometimes an occasion for a more supported assurance I remember to have seen him after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mellow enough very deliberately take a brush with brown varnish that was accidentally lying in the place and rub it over the piece with great composure before all the company and then ask if he had not improved the tints  "When he had finished his commission in Paris he left me strongly recommended  to several men of distinction as a person very proper for a travelling tutor and I was after some time employed in that capacity by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris in order to set him forward on his tour through Europe I was to be the young gentleman's governor with this injunction that he should always be permitted to direct himself My pupil in fact understood the art of guiding in money concerns much better than me He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thousand pounds left him by an uncle in the West Indies and his guardians to qualify him for the management of it had bound him apprentice to an attorney Thus avarice was his prevailing passion all his questions on the road were how money might be saved which was the least expensive course of travel whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again in London  Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing he was ready enough to look at but if the sight was to be paid for he usually asserted that he had been told it was not worth seeing He never paid a bill that he would not observe how amazingly expensive travelling was and all this though he was not yet come to the age of twentyone When arrived at Leghorn as we took a walk to look at the port and shipping he enquired the expence of the passage by sea home to England This he was informed was but a trifle compared to his returning by land he was therefore unable to withstand the temptation so paying me the small part of my salary that was then due he took leave and embarked with only one attendant for London  "I now therefore was left once more upon the world at large but then it was  a thing I was used to However my skill in music could avail me nothing in a country where every peasant was a better musician than I but by this time I had acquired another talent which answered my purpose as well and this was a skill in disputation In all the foreign universities and convents there are upon certain days philosophical theses maintained against every adventitious disputant for which if the champion opposes with any dexterity he can claim a gratuity in money a dinner and a bed for one night In this manner therefore I fought my way towards England walked along from city to city examined mankind more nearly and if I may so express it saw both sides of the picture My remarks however were few I found that monarchy was the best government for the poor to live in and commonwealths for the rich I found that riches in general were in every country another  name for freedom and that no man is so sond of freedom himself that he would not chuse to subject the will of some individuals of society to his own  "Upon my arrival in England I resolved to pay my respects first to you and then to enlist as a volunteer in the first expedition that was sent out but on my journey down my resolutions were changed by meeting an old acquaintace who I found belonged to a company of comedians that were going to make a summer campaign in the country The company seemed not much to disapprove of me for an associate They all however apprized me of the importance of the task at which I aimed that the public was a many headed monster and that only such as had very good heads could please it that acting was not to be learnt in a day and that without some traditional shrugs which had been on the  stage and only on the stage these hundred years I could never pretend to please The next difficulty was in fitting me with parts as almost every character was in keeping I was driven for some time from one character to another till at last Horatio was fixed upon which the presence of the present company happily hindered me from acting"  CHAP II  The short continuance of friendship amongst the vicious which is coeval only with mutual satisfaction  MY son's account was too long to be delivered at once the first part of it was begun that night and he was concluding the rest after dinner the next day when the appearance of Mr Thornhill's equipage at the door seemed to make a pause in the general satisfaction The butler who was now become my friend in the family informed me with a whisper that the 'Squire had already made some overtures to Miss Wilmot and that her aunt and uncle seemed highly to approve the  match Upon Mr Thornhill's entering he seemed at seeing my son and me to start back but I readily imputed that to surprize and not displeasure However upon our advancing to salute him he returned our greeting with the most apparent candour and after a short time his presence seemed only to encrease the general good humour  After tea he called me aside to enquire after my daughter but upon my informing him that my enquiry was unsuccessful he seemed greatly surprised adding that he had been since frequently at my house in order to comfort the rest of my family whom he left perfectly well He then asked if I had communicated her misfortune to Miss Wilmot or my son and upon my replying that I had not told them as yet he greatly approved my prudence and precaution desiring me by all means to keep it a secret  "For at best"  cried he  "it is but divulging one's own infamy  and perhaps Miss Livy may not be so guilty as we all imagine"  We were here interrupted by a servant who came to ask the 'Squire in to stand up at country dances so that he left me quite pleased with the interest he seemed to take in my concerns His addresses however to Miss Wilmot were too obvious to be mistaken and yet she seemed not perfectly pleased but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her aunt than from real inclination I had even the satisfaction to see her lavish some kind looks upon my unfortunate son which the other could neither extort by his fortune nor assiduity Mr Thornhill's seeming composure however not a little surprised me we had now continued here a week at the pressing instances of Mr Arnold but each day the more tenderness Miss Wilmot shewed my son Mr Thornhill's friendship seemed proportionably to encrease for him  He had formerly made us the most kind assurances of using his interest to serve the family but now his generosity was not confined to promises alone the morning I designed for my departure Mr Thornhill came to me with looks of real pleasure to inform me of a piece of service he had done for his friend George This was nothing less than his having procured him an ensign's commission in one of the regiments that was going to the West Indies for which he had promised but one hundred pounds his interest having been sufficient to get an abatement of the other two  "As for this trifling piece of service"  continued the young gentleman  "I desire no other reward but the pleasure of having served my friend and as for the hundred pound to be paid if you are unable to raise it yourselves I will advance it and you shall repay me at your leisure"  This was a favour we wanted words to express our sense of I readily therefore gave my bond for the money and testified  as much gratitude as if I never intended to pay  George was to depart for town the next day to secure his commission in pursuance of his generous patron's directions who judged it highly expedient to use dispatch lest in the mean time another should step in with more advantageous proposals The next morning therefore our young soldier was early prepared for his departure and seemed the only person among us that was not affected by it Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter nor the friends and mistress for Miss Wilmot actually loved him he was leaving behind any way damped his spirits After he had taken leave of the rest of the company I gave him all I had my blessing  "And now my boy"  cried I  "thou art going to fight for thy country remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his sacred king when loyalty among Britons was a virtue Go my boy and immitate  him in all but his misfortunes if it was a misfortune to die with Lord Falkland Go my boy and if you fall tho' distant exposed and unwept by those that love you the most precious tears are those with which heaven bedews the unburied head of a soldier"  The next morning I took leave of the good family that had been kind enough to entertain me so long not without several expressions of gratitude to Mr Thornhill for his late bounty I left them in the enjoyment of all that happiness which affluence and good breeding procure and returned towards home despairing of ever finding my daughter more but sending a sigh to heaven to spare and to forgive her I was now come within about twenty miles of home having hired an horse to carry me as I was yet but weak and comforted myself with the hopes of soon seeing all I held dearest upon earth But the night  coming on I put up at a little publichouse by the roadside and asked for the landlord's company over a pint of wine We sate beside his kitchen fire which was the best room in the house and chatted on politics and the news of the country We happened among other topics to talk of young 'Squire Thornhill whom the host assured me was hated as much as an uncle of his who sometimes came down to the country was loved He went on to observe that he made it his whole study to betray the daughters of such as received him to their houses and after a fortnight or three weeks possession he turned them out unrewarded and abandoned to the world As we continued our discourse in this manner his wife who had been out to get change returned and perceiving that her husband was enjoying a pleasure in which she was not a sharer she asked him in an angry tone what he did there to which he only replied in an ironical way by drinking her health  "Mr  Symmonds"  cried she  "you use me very ill and I'll bear it no longer Here three parts of the business is left for me to do and the fourth left unfinished while you do nothing but soak with the guests all day long whereas if a spoonful of liquor were to cure me of a fever I never touch a drop"  I now found what she would be at and immediately poured her out a glass which she received with a curtesy and drinking towards my good health  "Sir"  resumed she  "it is not so much for the value of the liquor I am angry but one cannot help it when the house is going out of the windows If the customers or guests are to be dunned all the burthen lies upon my back he'd as lief eat that glass as budge after them himself There now above stairs we have a young woman who has come to take up her lodgings here and I don't believe she has got any money by her overcivility I am certain  she is very slow of payment and I wish she were put in mind of it"    "What signifies minding her"  cried the host  "if she be slow she is sure"    "I don't know that"  replied the wife  "but I know that I am sure she has been here a fortnight and we have not yet seen the cross of her money"    "I suppose my dear"  cried he  "we shall have it all in a lump"    "In a lump"  cried the other  "I hope we may get it any way and that I am resolved we shall this very night or out she tramps bag and baggage"    "Consider my dear"  cried the husband  "she is a gentlewoman and deserves more respect"    "As for the matter of that"  returned the hostess  "gentle or simple out she shall pack with a sassarara Gentry may be good things where they take but for my part I never saw much good of them at the sign of the Harrow"  Thus saying she ran up a narrow flight of stairs that went from the kitchen  to a room overhead and I soon perceived by the loudness of her voice and the bitterness of her reproaches that no money was to be had from her lodger I could hear her remonstrances very distinctly  "Out I say pack out this moment tramp thou infamous strumpet or I'll give thee a mark thou won't be the better for this three months What you trumpery to come and take up an honest house without cross or coin to bless yourself with come along I say"    "O dear madam"  cried the stranger  "pity me pity a poor abandoned creature for one night and death will soon do the rest"  I instantly knew the voice of my poor ruined child Olivia I flew to her rescue while the woman was dragging her along by the hair and caught the dear forlorn wretch in my arms  "Welcome any way welcome my dearest lost one my treasure to your poor old father's bosom Tho' the vicious forfake thee there is yet one in the  world that will never forsake thee tho' thou hadst ten thousand crimes to answer for he will forget them all"    "O my own dear  for minutes she could no more  my own dearest good papa Could angels be kinder How do I deserve so much The villain I hate him and myself to be a reproach to such goodness You can't forgive me I know you cannot"    "Yes my child from my heart I do forgive thee Only repent and we both shall yet be happy We shall see many pleasant days yet my Olivia"    "Ah never sir never The rest of my wretched life must be infamy abroad and shame at home But alas papa you look much paler than you used to do Could such a thing as I am give you so much uneasiness Sure you have too much wisdom to take the miseries of my guilt upon yourself"    "Our wisdom young woman"  replied I  "Ah why so cold a name papa"  cried she  "This is the first time you ever called me by so cold a name"    "I ask pardon my darling"  returned I  "but I was going to observe that wisdom makes but a slow defence against trouble though at last a sure one"  The landlady now returned to know if we did not chuse a more genteel apartment to which assenting we were shewn a room where we could converse more freely After we had talked ourselves into some degree of tranquillity I could not avoid desiring some account of the gradations that led to her present wretched situation  "That villain sir"  said she  "from the first day of our meeting made me honourable though private proposals"  "Villain indeed"  cried I  "and yet it in some measure surprizes me how a person of Mr Burchell's good sense and seeming honour could be guilty of such deliberate baseness and thus step into a family to undo it"  "My dear papa"  returned my daughter  "you labour under a strange mistake Mr Burchell never attempted to deceive me Instead of that he took every opportunity of privately admonishing me against the artifices of Mr Thornhill whom now I find was even worse than he represented him"    "Mr Thornhill"  interrupted I  "can it be"    "Yes Sir"  returned she  "it was Mr Thornhill who seduced me who employed the two ladies as he called them but who in fact were abandoned women of the town without breeding or pity to decoy us up to London Their artifices you may remember would have certainly succeeded but for Mr Burchell's letter who directed those reproaches at them which we all applied to ourselves How he came to have so much influence as to defeat their intentions still remains a secret to me but I am convinced he was ever our warmest sincerest friend"  "You amaze me my dear"  cried I  "but now I find my first suspicions of Mr Thornhill's baseness were too well grounded but he can triumph in security for he is rich and we are poor But tell me my child sure it was no small temptation that could thus obliterate all the impressions of such an education and so virtuous a disposition as thine"  "Indeed Sir"  replied she  "he owes all his triumph to the desire I had of making him and not myself happy I knew that the ceremony of our marriage which was privately performed by a popish priest was no way binding and that I had nothing to trust to but his honour"  "What"  interrupted I  "and were you indeed married by a priest and in orders"    "Indeed Sir we were"  replied she  "though we were both sworn to conceal his name"    "Why then my  child come to my arms again and now you are a thousand times more welcome than before for you are now his wife to all intents and purposes nor can all the laws of man tho' written upon tables of adamant lessen the force of that sacred connexion"  "Alas Papa"  replied she  "you are but little acquainted with his villainies he has been married already by the same priest to six or eight wives more whom like me he has deceived and abandoned"  "Has he so"  cried I  "then we must hang the priest and you shall inform against him tomorrow"    "But Sir"  returned she  "will that be right when I am sworn to secrecy"    "My dear"  I replied  "if you have made such a promise I cannot nor will not tempt you to break it Even tho' it may benefit the public you must not inform against him In all human institutions  a smaller evil is allowed to procure a greater good as in politics a province may be given away to secure a kingdom in medicine a limb may be lopt off to preserve the body But in religion the law is written and inflexible  never  to do evil And this law my child is right for otherwise if we commit a smaller evil to procure a greater good certain guilt would be thus incurred in expectation of contingent advantage And though the advantage should certainly follow yet the interval between commission and advantage which is allowed to be guilty may be that in which we are called away to answer for the things we have done and the volume of human actions is closed for ever But I interrupt you my dear go on"  "The very next morning"  continued she  "I found what little expectations I was to have from his sincerity That very  morning he introduced me to two unhappy women more whom like me he had deceived but who lived in contented prostitution I loved him too tenderly to bear such rivals in his affections and strove to forget my infamy in a tumult of pleasures With this view I danced dressed and talked but still was unhappy The gentlemen who visited there told me every moment of the power of my charms and this only contributed to encrease my melancholy as I had thrown all their power quite away Thus each day I grew more pensive and he more insolent till at last the monster had the assurance to offer me to a young Baronet of his acquaintance Need I describe Sir how his ingratitude stung me My answer to this proposal was almost madness I desired to part As I was going he offered me a purse but I flung it at him with indignation and burst from  him in a rage that for a while kept me insensible of the miseries of my situation But I soon looked round me and saw myself a vile abject guilty thing without one friend in the world to apply to  "Just in that interval a stagecoach happening to pass by I took a place it being my only aim to be driven at a distance from a wretch I despised and detested I was set down here where since my arrival my own anxiety and this woman's unkindness have been my only companions The hours of pleasure that I have passed with my mamma and sister now grow painful to me Their sorrows are much but mine is greater than theirs for mine is guilt and infamy"  "Have patience my child"  cried I  "and I hope things will yet be better Take some repose tonight and tomorrow  I'll carry you home to your mother and the rest of the family from whom you will receive a kind reception Poor woman this has gone to her heart but she loves you still Olivia and will forget it"  CHAP III  Offences are easily pardoned where there is love at bottom  THE next morning I took my daughter behind me and set out on my return home As we travelled along I strove by every persuasion to calm her sorrows and fears and to arm her with resolution to bear the presence of her offended mother I took every opportunity from the prospect of a fine country through which we passed to observe how much kinder heaven was to us than we were to each other and that the misfortunes of nature's making were very few I assured her that she should never perceive any change in  my affections and that during my life which yet might be long she might depend upon a guardian and an instructor I armed her against the censures of the world shewed her that books were sweet unreproaching companions to the miserable and that if they could not bring us to enjoy life they would teach us to endure it  The hired horse that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the way within about five miles from my house and as I was willing to prepare my family for my daughter's reception I determined to leave her that night at the inn and to come for her accompanied by my daughter Sophia early the next morning It was night before we reached our appointed stage however after seeing her provided with a decent apartment and having ordered the hostess to prepare proper refreshments I kissed her and proceeded towards home My heart caught new sensations of pleasure  the nearer I approached that peaceful mansion As a bird that has been frighted from its nest my affections outwent my haste and hovered round my little fireside with all the rapture of expectation I called up the many fond things I had to say and anticipated the welcome I was to receive I already felt my wife's tender embrace and smiled at the joy of my little ones As I walked but slowly the night wained apace The labourers of the day were all retired to rest the lights were out in every cottage no sounds were heard but of the shrilling cock and the deepmouthed watchdog at hollow distance I approached my little abode of pleasure and before I was within a furlong of the place our honest mastiff came running to welcome me  It was now near midnight that I came to knock at my door all was still and silent my heart dilated with unutterable happiness  when to my amazement the house was bursting out in a blaze of fire and every apperture was red with conflagration I gave a loud convulsive outcry and fell upon the pavement insensible This alarmed my son who perceiving the flames instantly waked my wife and daughter and all running out naked and wild with apprehension recalled me to life with their anguish But it was only to objects of new terror for the flames had by this time caught the roof of our dwelling part after part continuing to fall in while the family stood with silent agony looking on as if they enjoyed the blaze I gazed upon them and upon it by turns and then looked round me for my two little ones but they were not to be seen O misery  "Where"  cried I  "where are my little ones"    "They are burnt to death in the flames"  says my wife calmly  "and I will die with them"  That moment I heard the cry of the babes within who were just awaked  by the fire and nothing could have stopped me  "Where where are my children"  cried I rushing through the flames and bursting the door of the chamber in which they were confined  "Where are my little ones"    "Here dear papa here we are"  cried they together while the flames were just catching the bed where they lay I caught them both in my arms and snatched them through the fire as fast as possible while just as I was got out the roof sunk in  "Now"  cried I holding up my children  "now let the flames burn on and all my possessions perish Here they are I have saved my treasure Here my dearest here are our treasures and we shall yet be happy"  We kissed our little darlings a thousand times they clasped us round the neck and seemed to share our transports while their mother laughed and wept by turns  I now stood a calm spectator of the flames and after some time began to perceive that my arm to the shoulder was scorched in a terrible manner It was therefore out of my power to give my son any assistance either in attempting to fave our goods or preventing the flames spreading to our corn By this time the neighbours were alarmed and came running to our assistance but all they could do was to stand like us spectators of the calamity My goods among which were the notes I had reserved for my daughters fortunes were entirely consumed except a box with some papers that stood in the kitchen and two or three things more of little consequence which my son brought away in the beginning The neighbours contributed however what they could to lighten our distress They brought us cloaths and furnished one of our outhouses with kitchen utensils so that by daylight we had another tho' a wretched dwelling to retire to My honest next  neighbour and his children were not the least assiduous in providing us with every thing necessary and offering what ever consolation untutored benevolence could suggest  When the fears of my family had subsided curiosity to know the cause of my long stay began to take place having therefore informed them of every particular I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lost one and tho' we had nothing but wretchedness now to impart yet to procure her a welcome to what we had This task would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity which had humbled my wife's pride and blunted it by more poignant afflictions Being unaable to go for my poor child myself as my arm now grew very painful I sent my son and daughter who soon returned supporting the wretched delinquent who had not courage to look up at her mother whom  no instructions of mine could persuade to a perfect reconciliation for women have a much stronger sense of female error than men  "Ah madam"  cried her mother  "this is but a poor place you are come to after so much finery My daughter Sophy and I can afford but little entertainment to persons who have kept company only with people of distinction Yes Miss Livy your poor father and I have suffered very much of late but I hope heaven will forgive you"  During this reception the unhappy victim stood pale and trembling unable to weep or to reply but I could not continue a silent spectator of her distress wherefore assuming a degree of severity in my voice and manner which was ever followed with instant submission  "I entreat woman that my words may be now marked once for all I have here brought you back a poor deluded wanderer her return to duty demands the revival of our tenderness The  real hardships of life are now coming fast upon us let us not therefore encrease them by dissention among each other If we live harmoniously together we may yet be contented as there are enough of us here to shut out the censuring world and keep each other in countenance The kindness of heaven is promised to the penitent and let ours be directed by the example Heaven we are assured is much more pleased to view a repentant sinner than many persons who have supported a course of undeviating rectitude And this is right for that single effort by which we stop short in the downhill path to perdition is itself a greater exertion of virtue than an hundred acts of justice"  CHAP IV  None but the guilty can be long and completely miserable  SOME assiduity was now required to make our present abode as convenient as possible and we were soon again qualified to enjoy our former serenity Being disabled myself from assisting my son in our usual occupations I read to my family from the few books that were saved and particularly from such as by amusing the imagination contributed to ease the heart Our good neighbours too came every day with the kindest condolence and fixed a time in which they were all to assist at repairing my former dwelling Honest farmer Williams  was not last among these visitors but heartily offered his friendship He would even have renewed his addresses to my daughter but she rejected them in such a manner as totally represt his future solicitations Her grief seemed formed for continuing and she was the only person of our little society that a week did not restore to chearfulness She now lost that unblushing innocence which once taught her to respect herself and to seek pleasure by pleasing Anxeity now had taken strong possession of her mind her beauty began to be impaired with her constitution and neglect still more contributed to diminish it Every tender epithet bestowed on her sister brought a pang to her heart and a tear to her eye and as one vice tho' cured almost ever plants others where it has been so her former guilt tho' driven out by repentance left jealousy and envy behind I strove a thousand ways to lessen her care and even forgot my own pain in a concern for her's  collecting such amusing passages of history as a strong memory and some reading could suggest  "Our happiness my dear"  I would say  "is in the power of one who can bring it about a thousand unforeseen ways that mock our foresight If example be necessary to prove this I'll give you a story my child told us by a grave tho' sometimes a romancing historian  "Matilda was married very young to a Neapolitan nobleman of the first quality and found herself a widow and a mother at the age of fifteen As she stood one day caressing her infant son in the open window of an apartment which hung over the river Volturna the child with a sudden spring leaped from her arms into the flood below and disappeared in a moment The mother struck with instant surprize and making an effort to save him plunged in after but far  from being able to assist the infant she herself with great difficulty escaped to the opposite shore just when some French soldiers were plundering the country on that side who immediately made her their prisoner  "As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians with the utmost inhumanity they were going at once to perpetrate those two extremes suggested by appetite and cruelty This base resolution however was opposed by a young officer who tho' their retreat required the utmost expedition placed her behind him and brought her in safety to his native city Her beauty at first caught his eye her merit soon after his heart They were married he rose to the highest posts they lived long together and were happy But the felicity of a soldier can never be called permanent after an interval of several years  the troops which he commanded having met with a repulse he was obliged to take shelter in the city where he had lived with his wife Here they suffered a siege and the city at length was taken Few histories can produce more various instances of cruelty than those which the French and Italians at that time exercised upon each other It was resolved by the victors upon this occasion to put all the French prisoners to death but particularly the husband of the unfortunate Matilda as he was principally instrumental in protracting the siege Their determinations were in general executed almost as soon as resolved upon The captive soldier was led forth and the executioner with his sword stood ready while the spectators in gloomy silence awaited the fatal blow which was only suspended till the general who presided as judge should give the signal It was in this interval of anguish and exall  pectation that Matilda came to take her last farewell of her husband and deliverer deploring her wretched situation and the cruelty of fate that had saved her from perishing by a premature death in the river Volturna to be the spectator of still greater calamities The general who was a young man was struck with surprize at her beauty and pity at her distress but with still stronger emotions when he heard her mention her former dangers He was her son the infant for whom she had encounter'd so much danger He acknowledged her at once as his mother and fell at her feet The rest may be easily supposed the captive was set free and all the happiness that love friendship and duty could confer on each were united"  In this manner I would attempt to amuse my daughter but she listened with divided attention for her own misfortunes engrossed  the pity she once had for those of another and nothing gave her ease In company she dreaded contempt and in solitude she only found anxiety Such was the colour of her wretchedness when we received certain information that Mr Thornhill was going to be married to Miss Wilmot for whom I always suspected he had a real passion tho' he took every opportunity before me to express his contempt both of her person and fortune This news only served to encrease poor Olivia's affliction such a flagrant breach of fidelity was more than her courage could support I was resolved however to get more certain information and to defeat if possible the completion of his designs by sending my son to old Mr Wilmot's with instructions to know the truth of the report and to deliver Miss Wilmot a letter intimating Mr Thornhill's conduct in my family My son went in pursuance of my directions and in three days returned assuring us of the truth of  the acount but that he had found it impossible to deliver the letter which he was therefore obliged to leave as Mr Thornhill and Miss Wilmot were visiting round the country They were to be married he said in a few days having appeared together at church the Sunday before he was there in great splendour the bride attended by six young ladies drest in white and he by as many gentlemen Their approaching nuptials filled the whole country with rejoicing and they usually rode out together in the grandest equipage that had been seen in the country for many years All the friends of both families he said were there particularly the 'Squire's uncle Sir William Thornhill who bore so good a character He added that nothing but mirth and feasting were going forward that all the country praised the young bride's beauty and the bridegroom's fine person and that they were immensely fond of each other concluding that he  could not help thinking Mr Thornhill one of the most happy men in the world  "Why let him if he can"  returned I  "but my son observe this bed of straw and unsheltering roof those mouldering walls and humid floor my wretched body thus disabled by fire and my children weeping round me for bread you have come home my child to all this yet here even here you see a man that would not for a thousand worlds exchange situations O my children if you could but learn to commune with your own hearts and know what noble company you can make them you would little regard the elegance and splendours of the worthless Almost all men have been taught to call life a passage and themselves the travellers The similitude  still may be improved when we observe that the good are joyful and serene like travellers that are going towards home the wicked but by intervals happy like travellers that are going into exile"  My compassion for my poor daughter overpowered by this new disaster interrupted what I had farther to observe I bade her mother support her and after a short time she recovered She appeared from this time more calm and I imagined had gained a new degree of resolution but appearances deceived me for her tranquility was the langour of overwrought resentment A supply of provisions charitably sent us by my kind parishioners seemed to diffuse chearfulness amongst the rest of the family nor was I displeased at seeing them once more sprightly and at ease It would have been unjust to damp their  satisfactions merely to condole with resolute melancholy or to burthen them with a sadness they did not feel Once more therefore the tale went round and the song was demanded and chearfulness condescended to hover round our little habitation  CHAP V  Fresh calamities  THE next morning the sun arose with peculiar warmth for the season so that we agreed to breakfast together at the honeysuckle bank where while we sate my youngest daughter at my request joined her voice to the concert on the trees about us It was here my poor Olivia first met her seducer and every object served to recall her sadness But that melancholy which is excited by objects of pleasure or inspired by sounds of harmony sooths the heart instead of corroding it Her mother too upon this occasion felt a pleasing distress and wept and loved her  daughter as before  "Do my pretty Olivia"  cried she  "let us have that little melancholy air your pappa was so fond of your sister Sophy has already obliged us Do child it will please your old father"  She complied in a manner so exquisitely pathetic as moved me  WHEN lovely woman stoops to folly  And finds too late that men betray  What charm can sooth her melancholy  What art can wash her guilt away  The only art her guilt to cover  To hide her shame from every eye  To give repentance to her lover  And wring his bosomis to die  As she was concluding the last stanza to which an interruption in her voice from sorrow gave peculiar softness the appearance of Mr Thornhill's equipage at a distance alarmed us all but particularly encreased  the uneasiness of my eldest daughter who desirous of shunning her betrayer returned to the house with her sister In a few minutes he was alighted from his chariot and making up to the place where I was still sitting enquired after my health with his usual air of familiarity  "Sir"  replied I  "your present assurance only serves to aggravate the baseness of your character and there was a time when I would have chastised your insolence for presuming thus to appear before me But now you are safe for age has cooled my passions and my calling restrains them"  "I vow my dear sir"  returned he  "I am amazed at all this nor can I understand what it means I hope you don't think your daughter's late excursion with me had any thing criminal in it"  "Go"  cried I  "thou art a wretch a poor pitiful wretch and every way a lyar but your meanness secures you from my anger Yet sir I am descended from a family that would not have borne this And so thou vile thing to gratify a momentary passion thou hast made one poor creature wretched for life and polluted a family that had nothing but honour for their portion"  "If she or you"  returned he  "are resolved to be miserable I cannot help it But you may still be happy and whatever opinion you may have formed of me you shall ever find me ready to contribute to it We can readily marry her to another and what is more she may keep her lover beside for I protest I shall ever continue to have a true regard for her"  I found all my passions awakened at this new degrading proposal for though the mind may often be calm under great injuries little villainy can at any time get within the soul and sting it into rage  "Avoid my sight thou reptile"  cried I  "nor continue to insult me with thy presence Were my brave son at home he would not suffer this but I am old and disabled and every way undone"  "I find"  cried he  "you are bent upon obliging me to talk in an harsher manner than I intended But as I have shewn you what may be hoped from my friendship it may not be improper to represent what may be the consequences of my resentment My attorney to whom your late bond has heen transferred threatens hard nor do I know how to prevent the course of justice except by paying the money myself which as I have been at some expences lately previous  to my intended marriage it is not so easy to be done And then my steward talks of driving for the rent it is certain he knows his duty for I never trouble myself with affairs of that nature Yet still I could wish to serve you and even to have you and your daughter present at my marriage which is shortly to be solemnized with Miss Wilmot it is even the request of my charming Arabella herself whom I hope you will not refuse"  "Mr Thornhill"  replied I  "hear me once for all as to your marriage with any but my daughter that I never will consent to and though your friendship could raise me to a throne or your resentment sink me to the grave yet would I despise both Thou hast once wofully irreparably deceived me I reposed my heart upon thine honour and have found its baseness Never  more therefore expect friendship from me Go and possess what fortune has given thee beauty riches health and pleasure Go and leave me to want infamy disease and sorrow Yet humbled as I am shall my heart still vindicate its dignity and though thou hast my forgiveness thou shalt ever have my contempt"  "If so"  returned he  "depend upon it you shall feel the effects of this insolence and we shall shortly see which is the fittest object of scorn you or me"  Upon which he departed abruptly  My wife and son who were present at this interview seemed terrified with the apprehension My daughters also finding that he was gone came out to be informed of the result of our conference which when known alarmed them not less than the rest But as to myself I disregarded  the utmost stretch of his malevolence he had already struck the blow and now I stood prepared to repel every new effort Like one of those instruments used in the art of war which however thrown still presents a point to receive the enemy  We soon however found that he had not threatened in vain for the very next day his steward came to demand my annual rent which by the train of accidents already related I was unable to pay The consequence of my incapacity was his driving my cattle that evening and their being appraised and sold the next day for less than half their value My wife and children now therefore entreated me to comply upon any terms rather than incur certain destruction They even begged of me to admit his visits once more and used all their little eloquence to paint the calamities I was going to endure The terrors of  a prison in so rigorous a season as the present with the danger that threatened my health from the late accident that happened by the fire But I continued inflexible  "Why my treasures"  cried I  "why will you thus attempt to persuade me to the thing that is not right My duty has taught me to forgive him but my conscience will not permit me to approve Would you have me applaud to the world what my heart must internally condemn Would you have me tamely sit down and flatter our infamous betrayer and to avoid a prison continually suffer the more galling bonds of mental confinement No never If we are to be taken from this abode only let us hold to the right and wherever we are thrown we can still retire to a charming apartment and look round our  own hearts with intrepidity and with pleasure"  In this manner we spent that evening Early the next morning as the snow had fallen in great abundance in the night my son was employed in clearing it away and opening a passage before the door He had not been thus engaged long when he came running in with looks all pale to tell us that two strangers whom he knew to be officers of justice were making towards the house  Just as he spoke they came in and approaching the bed where I lay after previously informing me of their employment and business made me their prisoner bidding me prepare to go with them to the county gaol which was eleven miles off  "My friends"  said I  "this is severe weather on which you have come to  take me to a prison and it is particularly unfortunate at this time as one of my arms has lately been burnt in a terrible manner and it has thrown me into a slight fever and I want cloaths to cover me and I am now too weak and and old to walk far in such deep snow but if it must be so I'll try to obey you"  I then turned to my wife and children and directed them to get together what few things were left us and to prepare immediately for leaving this place I entreated them to be expeditious and desired my son to assist his elder sister who from a consciousness that she was the cause of all our calamities was fallen and had lost anguish in insensibility I encouraged my wife who pale and trembling clasped our affrighted little ones in her arms that clung to her bosom in silence dreading to  look round at the strangers In the mean time my youngest daughter prepared for our departure and as she received several hints to use dispatch in about an hour we were ready to depart  CHAP VI  No situation however wretched it seems but has some sort of comfort attending it  WE set forward from this peaceful neighbourhood and walked on slowly My eldest daughter being enfeebled by a slow fever which had begun for some days to undermine her constitution one of the officers who had an horse kindly took her behind him for even these men cannot entirely divest themselves of humanity My son led one of the little ones by the hand and my wife the other while I leaned upon my youngest girl whose tears fell not for her own but my distresses  We were now got from my late dwelling about two miles when we saw a crowd running and shouting behind us consisting of about fifty of my poorest parishioners These with dreadful imprecations soon seized upon the two officers of justice and swearing they would never see their minister go to gaol while they had a drop of blood to shed in his defence were going to use them with great severity The consequence might have been fatal had I not immediately interposed and with some difficulty rescued the officers from the hands of the enraged multitude My children who looked upon my delivery now as certain appeared transported with joy and were incapable of containing their raptures But they were soon undeceived upon hearing me address the poor deluded people who came as they imagined to do me service  "What my friends"  cried I  "and is this the way you love me Is this the manner you obey the instructions I have given you from the pulpit Thus to fly in the face of justice and bring down ruin on yourselves and me Which is your ringleader Shew me the man that has thus seduced you As sure as he lives he shall feel my resentment Alas my dear deluded flock return back to the duty you owe to God to your country and to me I shall yet perhaps one day see you in greater felicity here and contribute to make your lives more happy But let it at least be my comfort when I pen my fold for immortality that not one here shall be wanting"  They now seemed all repentance and melting into tears came one after the other to bid me farewell I shook each tenderly by the hand and leaving them my blessing proceeded forward without meeting any  farther interruption Some hours before night we reached the town or rather village for it consisted but of a few mean houses having lost all its former opulence and retaining no marks of its ancient superiority but the gaol  Upon entering we put up at an inn where we had such refreshments as could most readily be procured and I supped with my family with my usual chearfulness After seeing them properly accommodated for that night I next attended the sheriff's officers to the prison which had formerly been built for the purposes of war and consisted of one large apartment strongly grated and paved with stone common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the four and twenty Besides this every prisoner had a separate cell where he was locked in for the night  I expected upon my entrance to find nothing but lamentations and various sounds  of misery but it was very different The prisoners seemed all employed in one common design that of forgetting thought in merriment or clamour I was apprized of the usual perquisite required upon these occasions and immediately complied with the demand though the little money I had was very near being all exhausted This was immediately sent away for liquor and the whole prison soon was filled with riot laughter and prophaneness  "How"  cried I to myself  "shall men so very wicked be chearful and shall I be melancholy I feel only the same confinement with them and I think I have more reason to be happy"  With such reflections I laboured to become chearful but chearfulness was never yet produced by effort which is itself painful As I was sitting therefore in a corner of the gaol in a pensive posture one of  my fellow prisoners came up and sitting by me entered into conversation It was my constant rule in life never to avoid the conversation of any man who seemed to desire it for if good I might profit by his instruction if bad he might be assisted by mine I found this to be a knowing man of strong unlettered sense but a thorough knowledge of the world as it is called or more properly speaking of human nature on the wrong side He asked me if I had taken care to provide myfelf with a bed which was a circumstance I had never once attended to  "That's unfortunate"  cried he  "as you are allowed here nothing but straw and your apartment is very large and cold However you seem to be something of a gentleman and as I have been one myself in my time part of my bedcloaths are heartily at your service"  I thanked him professing my surprize at finding such humanity in a gaol in misfortunes adding to let him see that I was a scholar  "That the sage ancient seemed to understand the value of company in affliction when he said Ton kosmon aire ei+dos ton etairon and in fact"  continued I  "what is the World if it affords only solitude"  "You talk of the world Sir"  returned my fellow prisoner  "  the world is in its dotage and yet the cosmogony or creation of the world has puzzled the philosophers of every age What a medly of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world Sanconiathon Manetho Berosus and Ocellus Lucanus have all attempted it in vain The latter has these words Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan which implies    "I ask pardon Sir"  cried I  "for interrupting so much learning but I think I have heard all this before  Have I not had the pleasure of once seeing you at Welbridge fair and is not your name Ephraim Jenkinson"  At this demand he only sighed  "I suppose you must recollect"  resumed I  "one Doctor Primrose from whom you bought a horse"  He now at once recollected me for the gloominess of the place and the approaching night had prevented his distinguishing my features before  "Yes Sir"  returned Mr Jenkinson  "I remember you perfectly well I bought an horse but forgot to pay for him Your neighbour Flamborough is the only prosecutor I am any way afraid of at the next assizes for he intends to swear positively against me as a coiner I am heartily sorry Sir I ever deceived you or indeed any man for you see"  continued he shewing his shackles  "what my tricks have brought me to"  "Well sir"  replied I  "your kindness in offering me assistance when you could expect no return shall be repaid with my endeavours to soften or totally suppress Mr Flamborough's evidence and I will send my son to him for that purpose the first opportunity nor do I in the least doubt but he will comply with my request and as to my own evidence you need be under no uneasiness about that"  "Well sir"  cried he  "all the return I can make shall be yours You shall have more than half my bedcloaths to night and I'll take care to stand your friend in the prison where I think I have some influence"  I thanked him and could not avoid being surprised at the present youthful change in his aspect for at the time I had seen him before he appeared at least sixty  "Sir"  answered he  "you are little acquainted with the world I had at that time false hair and have learnt the art of counterfeiting every age from seventeen to seventy Ah sir had I but bestowed half the pains in learning a trade that I have in learning to be a scoundrel I might have been a rich man at this day But rogue as I am still I may be your friend and that perhaps when you least expect it"  We were now prevented from further conversation by the arrival of the gaoler's servants who came to call over the prisoners names and lock up for the night A fellow also with a bundle of straw for my bed attended who led me along a dark narrow passage into a room paved like the common prison and in one corner of this I spread my bed and the cloaths given me by my fellow prisoner which done  my conductor who was civil enough bade me a goodnight After my usual meditations and having praised my heavenly corrector I laid myself down and slept with the utmost tranquility till morning  CHAP VII  A reformation in the gaol To make laws complete they should reward as well as punish  THE next morning early I was awakened by my family whom I found in tears at my bedside The gloomy strength of every thing about us it seems had daunted them I gently rebuked their sorrow assuring them I had never slept with greater tranquility and next enquired after my eldest daughter who was not among them They informed me that yesterday's uneasiness and fatigue had encreased her fever and it was judged proper to leave her behind My next care was to send my son to procure a room or two to lodge the  family in as near the prison as conveniently could be found He obeyed but could only find one apartment which was hired at a small expence for his mother and sisters the gaoler with humanity consenting to let him and his two little brothers lie in the prison with me A bed was therefore prepared for them in a corner of the room which I thought answered very conveniently I was willing however previously to know whether my little children chose to lie in a place which seemed to fright them upon entrance  "Well"  cried I  "my good boys how do you like your bed I hope you are not afraid to lie in this room dark as it appears"  "No papa"  says Dick  "I am not afraid to lie any where where you are"  "And I"  says Bill who was yet but four years old  "love every place best that my papa is in"  After this I allotted to each of the family what they were to do My daughter was particularly directed to watch her declining sister's health my wife was to attend me my little boys were to read to me  "And as for you my son"  continued I  "it is by the labour of your hands we must all hope to be supported Your wages as a daylabourer will be full sufficient with proper frugality to maintain us all and comfortably too Thou art now sixteen years old and hast strength and it was given thee my son for very useful purposes for it must save from famine your helpless parents and family Prepare then this evening to look out for work against tomorrow and bring home every night what money you earn for our support"  Having thus instructed him and settled the rest I walked down to the common prison where I could enjoy more air and room But I was not long there when the execrations lewdness and brutality that invaded me on every side drove me back to my apartment again Here I sate for some time pondering upon the strange infatuation of wretches who finding all mankind in open arms against them were however labouring to make themselves a future and a tremendous enemy  Their insensibility excited my highest compassion and blotted my own uneasiness a while from my mind It even appeared as a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them I resolved therefore once more to return and in spite of their contempt to give them my advice and conquer them by perseverance Going therefore among them again I informed Mr Jenkinson of my design at which he laughed  but communicated it to the rest The proposal was received with the greatest goodhumour as it promised to afford a new fund of entertainment to persons who had now no other resource for mirth but what could be derived from ridicule or debauchery  I therefore read them a portion of the service with a loud unaffected voice and found my audience perfectly merry upon the occasion Lewd whispers groans of contrition burlesqued winking and coughing alternately excited laughter However I continued with my natural solemnity to read on sensible that what I did might amend some but could itself receive no contamination from any  After reading I entered upon my exhortation which was rather calculated at first to amuse them than to reprove I previously observed that no other motive but  their welfare could induce me to this that I was their fellow prisoner and now gained nothing by preaching I was sorry I said to hear them so very prophane because they got nothing by it but might lose a great deal  "For be assured my friends"  cried I  "for you are my friends however the world may disclaim your friendship though you swore twelve thousand oaths in a day it would not put one penny in your purse Then what signifies calling every moment upon the devil and courting his friendship since you find how scurvily he uses you He has given you nothing here you find but a mouthful of oaths and an empty belly and by the best accounts I have of him he will give you nothing that's good hereafter  "If used ill in our dealings with one man we naturally go elsewhere Were it not worth your while then just to try  how you may like the usage of another master who gives you fair promises at least to come to him Surely my Friends of all stupidity in the world his must be greatest who after robbing an house runs to the thieftakers for protection And yet how are you more wise You are all seeking comfort from him that has already betrayed you applying to a more malicious being than any thieftaker of them all for they only decoy and then hang you but he decoys and hangs and what is worst of all will not let you loose after the hangman has done"  When I had concluded I received the compliments of my audience some of whom came and shook me by the hand swearing that I was a very honest fellow and that they desired my further acquaintance I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day and actually conceived  some hopes of making a reformation here for it had ever been my opinion that no man was past the hour of amendment every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof if the archer could but take a proper aim When I had thus satisfied my mind I went back to my apartment where my wife had prepared a frugal meal while Mr Jenkinson begged leave to add his dinner to ours and partake of the pleasure as he was kind enough to express it of my conversation He had not yet seen my family for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow passage already described by this means they avoided the common prison Jenkinson at the first interview therefore seemed not a little struck with the beauty of my youngest daughter which her pensive air contributed to heighten and my little ones did not pass unnoticed  "Alas Doctor"  cried he  "these children are too handsome and too good for such a place as this"  "Why Mr Jenkinson"  replied I  "thank heaven my children are pretty tolerable in morals and if they be good it matters little for the rest"  "I fancy sir"  returned my fellow prisoner  "that it must give you great comfort to have this little family about you"  "A comfort Mr Jenkinson"  replied I  "yes it is indeed a comfort and I would not be without them for all the world for they can make a dungeon seem a palace There is but one way in this life of wounding my happiness and that is by injuring them"  "I am afraid then sir"  cried he  "that I am in some measure culpable for I think I see here  looking at my son Moses  "one that I have injured and by whom I wish to be forgiven"  My son immediately recollected his voice and features though he had before seen him in disguise and taking him by the hand with a smile forgave him  "Yet"  continued he  "I can't help wondering at what you could see in my face to think me a proper mark for deception"  "My dear sir"  returned the other  "it was not your face but your white stockings and the black ribband in your hair that allured me But no disparagement to your parts I have deceived wiser men than you in my time and yet with all my tricks the blockheads have been too many for me at last"  "I suppose"  cried my son  "that the narrative of such a life as yours must be extremely instructive and amusing"  "Not much of either"  returned Mr Jenkinson  "Those relations which describe  the tricks and vices only of mankind by increasing our suspicion in life retard our success The traveller that distrusts every person he meets and turns back upon the appearance of every man that looks like a robber seldom arrives in time to his journey's end"  "Indeed I think from my own experience I may say that the knowing one is the silliest fellow under the sun I was thought cunning from my very childhood when but seven years old the ladies would say that I was a perfect little man at fourteen I knew the world cocked my hat and loved the ladies at twenty though I was perfectly honest yet every one thought me so cunning that not one would trust me Thus I was at last obliged to turn sharper in my own defence and have lived ever since my head throbbing with  schemes to deceive and my heart palpitating with fears of detection"  "I used often to laugh at your honest simple neighbour Flamborough and one way or another generally cheated him once a year Yet still the honest man went forward without suspicion and grew rich while I still continued tricksy and cunning and was poor without the consolation of being honest"  "However"  continued he  "let me know your case and what has brought you here perhaps though I have not skill to avoid a gaol myself I may extricate my friends"  In compliance with his curiosity I informed him of the whole train of accidents and follies that had plunged me into my present troubles and my utter inabilty to get free  After hearing my story and pausing some minutes he slapt his forehead as if he had hit upon something material and took his leave saying he would try what could be done  CHAP VIII  The same subject continued  THE next morning I communicated to my wife and children the scheme I had planned of reforming the prisoners which they received with universal disapprobation alledging the impossibility and impropriety of it adding that my endeavours would no way contribute to their amendment but might probably disgrace my calling  "Excuse me"  returned I  "these people however fallen are still men and that is a very good title to my affections Good council rejected returns to enrich  the giver's bosom and though the instruction I communicate may not mend them yet it will assuredly mend myself If these wretches my children were princes there would be thousands ready to offer their ministry but in my opinion the heart that is buried in a dungeon is as precious as that seated upon a throne Yes my treasures if I can mend them I will perhaps they will not all despise me Perhaps I may catch up even one from the gulph and that will be great gain for is there upon earth a gem so precious as the human soul"  Thus saying I left them and descended to the common prison where I found the prisoners very merry expecting my arrival and each prepared with some gaol trick to play upon the doctor Thus as I was going to begin one turned my wig awry as if by accident and then asked my pardon  A second who stood at some distance had a knack of spitting through his teeth which fell in showers upon my book A third would cry amen in such an affected tone as gave the rest great delight A fourth had slily picked my pocket of my spectacles But there was one whose trick gave more universal pleasure than all the rest for observing the manner in which I had disposed my books on the table before me he very dextrously displaced one of them and put an obscene jestbook of his own in the place However I took no notice of all that this mischievous groupe of little beings could do but went on perfectly sensible that what was ridiculous in my attempt would excite mirth only the first or second time while what was serious would be permanent My design succeeded and in less than six days some were penitent and all attentive  It was now that I applauded my perseverance and address at thus giving sensibility to wretches divested of every moral feeling and now began to think of doing them temporal services also by rendering their situation somewhat more comfortable Their time had hitherto been divided between famine and excess tumultous riot and bitter repining Their only employment was quarrelling among each other playing cribbage and cutting tobacco stoppers From this last mode of idle industry I took the hint of setting such as chose to work at cutting pegs for tobacconists and shoemakers the proper wood being bought by a general subscription and when manufactured sold by my appointment so that each earned something every day a trifle indeed but sufficient to maintain him  I did not stop here but instituted fines or the punishment of immorality and rewards for peculiar industry Thus in less  than a fortnight I had formed them into something social and humane and had the pleasure of regarding myself as a legislator who had brought men from their native ferocity into friendship and obedience  And it were highly to be wished that legislative power would thus direct the law rather to reformation than severity That it would appear convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making punishments familiar but formidable Instead of our present prisons which find or make men guilty which enclose wretches for the commission of one crime and return them if returned alive fitted for the perpetuation of thousands it were to be wished we had as in other parts of Europe places of penitence and solitude where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty or new motives to virtue if innocent And this but not the increasing punishments is the  way to mend a state nor can I avoid even questioning the validity of that right which social combinations have assumed of capitally punishing offences of a slight nature In cases of murder their right is obvious as it is the duty of us all from the law of selfdefence to cut off that man who has shewn a disregard for the life of another Against such all nature rises in arms but it is not so against him who steals my property Natural law gives me no right to take away his life as by that the horse he steals is as much his property as mine If then I have any right it must be from a compact made between us that he who deprives the other of his horse shall die But this is a false compact because no man has a right to barter his life no more than to take it away as it is not his own And next the compact is inadequate and would be set aside even in a court of modern equity as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience since it is far better  that two men should live than that one man should ride But a compact that is false between two men is equally so between an hundred or an hundred thousand for as ten millions of circles can never make a square so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest foundation to falsehood It is thus that reason speaks and untutored nature says the same thing Savages that are directed nearly by natural law alone are very tender of the lives of each other they seldom shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty  Our Saxon ancestors fierce as they were in war had but few executions in times of peace and in all commencing governments that have the print of nature still strong upon them scarce any crime is held capital  It is among the citizens of a resined community that penal laws which are in  the hands of the rich are laid upon the poor Government while it grows older seems to acquire the moroseness of age and as if our possessions were become dearer in proportion as they increased as if the more enormous our wealth the more extensive our fears our possessions are paled up with new edicts every day and hung round with gibbets to scare every invader  Whether is it from the number of our penal laws or the licentiousness of our people that this country should shew more convicts in a year than half the dominions of Europe united Perhaps it is owing to both for they mutually produce each other When by indiscriminate penal laws a nation beholds the same punishment affixed to dissimilar degrees of guilt from perceiving no distinction in the penalty the people are led to lose all sense of distinction in the crime and this distinction is  the bulwark of all morality thus the multitude of laws produce new vices and new vices call for fresh restraints  It were to be wished then that power instead of contriving new laws to punish vice instead of drawing hard the cords of society till a convulsion come to burst them instead of cutting away wretches as useless before we have tried their utility instead of converting correction into vengeance it were to be wished that we tried the restrictive arts of government and made law the protector but not the tyrant of the people We should then find that creatures whose souls are held as dross only wanted the hand of a refiner we should then find that wretches now stuck up for long tortures lest luxury should feel a momentary pang might if properly treated serve to sinew the state in times of danger that as their faces are like ours their hearts are so too that few minds are so base as that perseverance  cannot amend that a man may see his last crime without dying for it and that very little blood will serve to cement our security  CHAP IX  Happiness and misery rather the result of prudence than of virtue in this life Temporal evils or felicities being regarded by heaven as things merely in themselves trifling and unworthy its care in the distribution  I Had now been confined more than a fortnight but had not since my arrival been visited by my dear Olivia and I greatly longed to see her Having communicated my wishes to my wife the next morning the poor girl entered my apartment leaning on her sister's arm The change which I saw in her countenance struck me The numberless graces that once resided there were now fled and the hand  of death seemed to have molded every feature to alarm me Her temples were sunk her forehead was tense and a fatal paleness sate upon her cheek  "I am glad to see thee my dear"  cried I  "but why this dejection Livy I hope my love you have too great a regard for me to permit disappointment thus to undermine a life which I prize as my own Be chearful child and we may yet see happier days"  "You have ever sir"  replied she  "been kind to me and it adds to my pain that I shall never have an opportunity of sharing that happiness you promise Happiness I fear is no longer reserved for me here and I long to be rid of a place where I have only found distress Indeed sir I wish you would make a proper submission to Mr Thornhill  it may in some measure induce him to pity you and it will give me relief in dying"  "Never child"  replied I  "I never shall be brought to acknowledge my daughter a prostitute for tho' the world may look upon your offence with scorn let it be mine to regard it as a mark of credulity not of guilt My dear I am no way miserable in this place however dismal it may seem and be assured that while you continue to bless me by living he shall never have my consent to make you more wretched by marrying another"  After the departure of my daughter my fellow prisoner who was by at this interview sensibly enough expostulated upon my obstinacy in refusing a submission which promised to give me freedom He observed that the rest of my family was not to be sacrificed to the peace of one child  alone and she the only one who had offended me  "Beside"  added he  "I don't know if it be just thus to obstruct the union of man and wife which you do at present by refusing to consent to a match which you cannot hinder but may render unhappy"  "Sir"  replied I  "you are unacquainted with the man that oppresses us I am very sensible that no submission I can make could procure me liberty even for an hour I am told that even in this very room a debtor of his no later than last year died for want But though my submission and approbation could transfer me from hence to the most beautiful apartment he is possessed of yet I would grant neither as something whispers me that it would be giving a sanction to adultery While my daughter lives no other marriage of his shall ever be legal in my eye Were  she removed indeed I should be the basest of men from any resentment of my own to attempt putting asunder those who wish for an union No villain as he is I could then wish him married to prevent the consequences of his future debaucheries But should I not now be the most cruel of all fathers to sign an Instrument which must send my child to the grave merely to avoid a prison myself and thus to escape one pang break my child's heart with a thousand"  He acquiesced in the justice of this answer but could not avoid observing that he feared my daughter's life was already too much wasted to keep me long a prisoner  "However continued he though you refuse to submit to the nephew I hope you have no objections to laying your case before the uncle who has the first character in the kingdom for every thing that is just and good I  would advise you to send him a letter by the post intimating all his nephew's ill usage and my life for it that in three days you shall have an answer"  I thank'd him for the hint and instantly fet about complying but I wanted paper and unluckily all our money had been laid out that morning in provisions however he supplied me  For the three ensuing days I was in a state of anxiety to know what reception my letter might meet with but in the mean time was frequently solicited by my wife to submit to any conditions rather than remain here and every hour received repeated accounts of the decline of my daughter's health The third day and the fourth arrived but I received no answer to my letter the complaints of a stranger against a favourite nephew were no way likely to succeed so that these hopes soon vanished like all my former My mind  however still supported itself though confinement and bad air began to make a visible alteration in my health and my arm that had suffered in the fire grew worse But my children still sate by me and while I was stretched on my straw read to me by turns or listened and wept at my instructions But my daughter's health declined faster than mine every message from her contributed to encrease my apprehensions and pain The fifth morning after I had written the letter which was sent to sir William Thornhill I was alarmed with an account that she was speechless Now it was that confinement was truly painful to me my soul was bursting from its prison to be near the pillow of my child to comfort to strengthen her to receive her last wishes and teach her soul the way to heaven Another account came She was expiring and yet I was debarred the small comfort of weeping  by her My fellow prisoner some time after came with the last account He bade me be patient She was deadThe next morning he returned and found me with my two little ones now my only companions who were using all their innocent efforts to comfort me They entreated to read to me and bid me not to cry for I was now too old to weep  "And is not my sister an angel now pappa"  cried the eldest  "and why then are you sorry for her I wish I were an angel out of this frightful place if my pappa were with me"  "Yes"  added my youngest darling  "Heaven where my sister is is a finer place than this and there are none but good people there and the people here are very bad"  Mr Jenkinson interupted their harmless prattle by observing that now my daughter was no more I should seriously think of the rest of my family and attempt to  save my own life which was every day declining for want of necessaries and wholesome air He added that it was now incumbent on me to sacrifice any pride or resentment of my own to the welfare of those who depended on me for support and that I was now both by reason and justice obliged to try to reconcile my landlord  "Heaven be praised"  replied I  "there is no pride left me now I should detest my own heart if I saw either pride or resentment lurking there On the contrary as my oppressor has been once my parishioner I hope one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal No sir I have no resentment now and though he has taken from me what I held dearer than all his treasures though he has wrung my heart for I am sick almost to fainting very sick my fellow prisoner yet that  shall never inspire me with vengeance I am now willing to approve his marriage and if this submission can do him any pleasure let him know that if I have done him any injury I am sorry for it"  Mr Jenkinson took pen and ink and wrote down my submission nearly as I have exprest it to which I signed my name My son was employed to carry the letter to Mr Thornhill who was then at his seat in the country He went and in about six hours returned with a verbal answer He had some difficulty he said to get a sight of his landlord as the servants were insolent and suspicious but he accidentally saw him as he was going out upon business preparing for his marriage which was to be in three days He continued to inform us that he stept up in the humblest manner and delivered the letter which when Mr Thornhill had read he said that all submission was now too late and unnecessary that he had heard of our application to his  uncle which met with the contempt it deserved and as for the rest that all future applications should be directed to his attorney not to him He observed however that as he had a very good opinion of the discretion of the two young ladies they might have been the most agreeable intercessors  "Well sir"  said I to my fellow prisoner  "you now discover the temper of the man that oppresses me He can at once be facetious and cruel but let him use me as he will I shall soon be free in spite of all his bolts to restrain me I am now drawing towards an abode that looks brighter as I approach it this expectation cheers my afflictions and though I shall leave an helpless family of orphans behind me yet they will not be utterly forsaken some friend perhaps will be found to assist them for the sake of their poor father and some  may charitably relieve them for the sake of their heavenly father"  Just as I spoke my wife whom I had not seen that day before appeared with looks of terror and making efforts but unable to speak  "Why my love"  cried I  "why will you thus encrease my affliction by your own what though no submissions can turn our severe master tho' he has doomed me to die in this place of wretchedness and though we have lost a darling child yet still you will find comfort in your other children when I shall be no more"  "We have indeed lost"  returned she  "a darling child My Sophia my dearest is gone snatched from us carried off by ruffians"  "How madam"  cried my fellow prisoner  "miss Sophia carried off by villains sure it cannot be"  She could only answer with a fixed look and a flood of tears But one of the prisoner's wives who was present and came in with her gave us a more distinct account she informed us that as my wife my daughter and herself were taking a walk together on the great road a little way out of the village a post chaise and four drove up to them and instantly stopt Upon which a well drest man but not Mr Thornhill stepping out clasped my daughter round the waist and forcing her in bid the postillion drive on so that they were out of sight in a moment  "Now"  cried I  "the sum of my miseries is made up nor is it in the power of any thing on earth to give me another pang What not one left not to leave  me one the monster the child that was next my heart she had the beauty of an angel and almost the wisdom of an angel But support that woman nor let her fall Not to leave me one"    "Alas my husband  said my wife  "you seem to want comfort even more than I Our distresses are great but I could bear this and more if I saw you but easy They may take away my children and all the world if they leave me but you"  My Son who was present endeavoured to moderate our grief he bade us take comfort for he hoped that we might still have reason to be thankful  "My child"  cried I  "look round the world and see if there be any happiness left me now Is not every ray of comfort shut out while all our bright prospects only lie beyond the grave"    "My dear father"  returned he  "I hope there is still something that will give you an interval  of satisfaction for I have a letter from my brother George"    "What of him child"  interrupted I  "does he know of our misery I hope my boy is exempt from any part of what his wretched family suffers"    "Yes sir"  returned he  "he is perfectly gay chearful and happy His letter brings nothing but good news he is the favourite of his colonel who promises to procure him the very next lieutenancy that becomes vacant"  "And are you sure of all this"  cried my wife  "are you sure that nothing ill has befallen my boy"    "Nothing indeed madam"  returned my son  "you shall see the letter which will give you the highest pleasure and if any thing can procure you comfort I am sure that will"  "But are you sure"  still repeated she  "that the letter is from himself and that he is really so happy    Yes Madam"  replied he  "it is certainly his and he will one day be the credit and the support of our family"    "Then I thank providence"  cried she  "that my last letter to him has miscarried"  "Yes my dear"  continued she" turning to me  "I will now confess that though the hand of heaven is sore upon us in other instances it has been favourable here By the last letter I wrote my son which was in the bitterness of anger I desired him upon his mother's blessing and if he had the heart of a man to see justice done his father and sister and avenge our cause But thanks be to him that directs all things it has miscarried and I am at rest"  "Woman"  cried I  "thou hast done very ill and at another time my reproaches might have been more severe Oh what a tremendous gulph hast thou escaped that would have buried both thee and him in endless ruin Providence indeed  has here been kinder to us than we to ourselves It has reserved that son to be the father and protector of my children when I shall be away How unjustly did I complain of being stript of every comfort when still I hear that he is happy and insensible of our afflictions still kept in reserve to support his widowed mother to protect his brothers and sisters But what sisters has he left he has no sisters now they are all gone robbed from me and I am undone"    "Father"  interupted my son  "I beg you will give me leave to read his letter I know it will please you"  Upon which with my permission he read as follows  Honoured Sir  I Have called off my imaginationa few moments from the pleasures that surround me to fix it upon objects that are still more pleasing the dear little fireside at home My fancy draws that harmless groupe as listening to every line of this with great composure I view those faces with delight which never felt the deforming hand of ambition or distress But whatever your happiness may be at home I am sure it will be some addition to it to hear that I am perfectly pleased with my situation and every way happy here  Our regiment is countermanded and is not to leave the kingdom the colonel who professes himself my friend takes me with him to all companies where he is acquainted and after my first visit I generally find myself received with encreased respect upon repeating it I danced last  night with Lady G and could I forget you know whom I might be perhaps successful But it is my fate still to remember others while I am myself forgotten by most of my absent friends and in this number I fear Sir that I must consider you for I have long expected the pleasure of a letter from home to no purpose Olivia and Sophia too promised to write but seem to have forgotten me Tell them they are two arrant little baggages and that I am this moment in a most violent passion with them yet still I know not how tho' I want to bluster a little my heart is respondent only to softer emotions Then tell them sir that after all I love them affectionately and be assured of my ever remaining  Your dutiful son  "In all our miseries"  cried I  "what thanks have we not to return that one at least of our family is exempted from what we suffer Heaven be his guard and keep my boy thus happy to be the supporter of his widowed mother and the father of these two babes which is all the patrimony I can now bequeath him May he keep their innocence from the temptations of want and be their conductor in the paths of honour"  I had scarce said these words when a noise like that of a tumult seemed to proceed from the prison below it died away soon after and a clanking of fetters was heard along the passage that led to my apartment The keeper of the prison entered holding a man all bloody wounded and fettered with the heaviest irons I looked with compassion on the wretch as he approached me but with horror when I found it was my own son  "My George My George and do I behold thee thus Wounded  Fettered Is this thy happiness Is this the manner you return to me O that this sight could break my heart at once and let me die"  "Where Sir is your fortitude"  returned my son with an intrepid voice  "I must suffer my life is forfeited and let them take it it is my last happiness that I have committed no murder tho' I have lost all hopes of pardon"  I tried to restrain my passions for a few minutes in silence but I thought I should have died with the effort  "O my boy my heart weeps to behold thee thus and I cannot cannot help it In the moment that I thought thee blest and prayed for thy safety to behold thee thus again Chained wounded And yet the death of the youthful is happy But I am old a very old man and have  lived to see this day To see my children all untimely falling about me while I continue a wretched survivor in the midst of ruin May all the curses that ever sunk a soul fall heavy upon the murderer of my children May he live like me to see"  "Hold Sir"  replied my son  "or I shall blush for thee How Sir forgetful of your age your holy calling thus to arrogate the justice of heaven and fling those curses upward that must soon descend to crush thy own grey head with destruction No Sir let it be your care now to fit me for that vile death I must shortly suffer to arm me with hope and resolution to give me courage to drink of that bitterness which must shortly be my portion"  "My child you must not die I am sure no offence of thine can deserve so  vile a punishment My George could never be guilty of any crime to make his ancestors ashamed of him"  "Mine Sir"  returned my son  "is I fear an unpardonable one I have sent a challenge and that is death by a late act of parliament When I received my mother's letter from home I immediately came down determined to punish the betrayer of our honour and sent him an order to meet me which he answered not in person but by his dispatching four of his domestics to seize me I wounded one but the rest made me their prisoner The coward is determined to put the law in execution against me the proofs are undeniable and as I am the first transgressor upon the statute I see no hopes of pardon But you have often charmed me with the lessons of fortitude let me now Sir find them in your example"  "And my son you shall find them I am now raised above this world and all the pleasures it can produce From this moment I break from my heart all the ties that held it down to earth and will prepare to fit us both for eternity Yes my son I will point out the way and my soul shall guide yours in the ascent for we will take our flight together I now see and am convinced you can expect no pardon here and I can only exhort you to seek it at that greatest tribunal where we both shall shortly answer But let us not be niggardly in our exhortation but let all our fellow prisoners have a share good gaoler let them be permitted to stand here while I attempt to improve them"  Thus saying I made an effort to rise from my straw but wanted strength and was able only to recline against the wall The prisoners assembled according to my directions for they loved  to hear my council my son and his mother supported me on either side I looked and saw that none were wanting and then addressed them with the following exhortation  CHAP X  The equal dealings of providence demonstrated with regard to the happy and the miserable here below That from the nature of pleasure and pain the wretched must be repaid the balance of their sufferings in the life hereafter  MY friends my children and fellow sufferers when I reflect on the distribution of good and evil here below I find that much has been given man to enjoy yet still more to suffer Though we should examine the whole world we shall not find one man so happy as to have nothing left to wish for but we daily see thousands who by suicide shew us they  have nothing left to hope In this life then it appears that we cannot be entirely blest but yet we may be completely miserable  Why man should thus feel pain why our wretchedness should be requisite in the formation of universal felicity why when all other systems are made perfect only by the perfection of their subordinate parts the great system should require for its perfection parts that are not only subordinate to others but imperfect in themselves These are questions that never can be explained and might be useless if known On this subject providence has thought fit to elude our curiosity satisfied with granting us motives to consolation  In this situation man has called in the friendly assistance of philosophy and heaven seeing the incapacity of that to console him has given him the aid of religion  The consolations of philosophy are very amusing but often fallacious It tells us that life is filled with comforts if we will but enjoy them and on the other hand that though we unavoidably have miseries here life is short and they will soon be over Thus do these consolations destroy each other for if life is a place of comfort its shortness must be misery and if it be long our griefs are protracted Thus philosophy is weak but religion comforts in an higher strain Man is here it tells us fitting up his mind and preparing it for another abode When the good man leaves the body and is all a glorious mind he will find he has been making himself a heaven of happiness here while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices shrinks from his body with terror and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of  heaven To religion then we must hold in every circumstance of life for our truest comfort for if already we are happy it is a pleasure to think that we can make that happiness unending and if we are miserable it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest Thus to the fortunate religion holds out a continuance of bliss to the wretched a change from pain  But though religion is very kind to all men it has promised peculiar reward to the unhappy the sick the naked the houseless the heavyladen and the prisoner have ever most frequent promises in our sacred law The author of our religion every where professes himself the wretch's friend and unlike the false ones of this world bestows all his caresses upon the forlorn The unthinking have censured this as partiality as a preference without  merit to deserve it But they never reflect that it is not in the power even of heaven itself to make the offer of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miserable To the first eternity is but a single blessing since at most it but encreases what they already possess To the latter it is a double advantage for it diminishes their pain here and rewards them with heavenly bliss hereafter  But providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than the rich for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable so it smooths the passage there The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror The man of sorrows lays himself quietly down he has no possessions to regret and but few ties to stop his departure he feels only nature's pang in the final separation and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before for after a certain degree of pain every  new breach that death opens in the constitution nature kindly covers with insensibility  Thus providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life greater felicity in dying and in heaven all that superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment And this superiority my friends is no small advantage and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable for though he was already in heaven and felt all the raptures it could give yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness that he had once been wretched and now was comforted that he had known what it was to be miserable and now felt what it was to be happy  Thus my friends you see religion does what philsophy could never do it shews the equal dealings of heaven to the happy  and the unhappy and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter and equal hopes to aspire after it but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasure here the poor have the endless satisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miserable when crowned with endless felicity hereafter and even though this should be called a small advantage yet being an eternal one it must make up by duration what the temporal happiness of the great may have exceeded by intenseness  These are therefore the consolations which the wretched have peculiar to themselves and in which they are above the rest of mankind in other respects they are below them They who would know the miseries of the poor must see life and endure it  To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy is only repeating what none either believe or practise The men who have the necessaries of living are not poor and they who want them must be miserable Yes my friends we must be miserable No vain efforts of a refined imagination can sooth the wants of nature can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapour of a dungeon or ease to the throbbings of a woeworn heart Let the philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these Alas the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain Death is slight and any man may sustain it but torments are dreadful and these no man can endure  To us then my friends the promises of happiness in heaven should be peculiarly dear for if our reward be in this life alone we are then indeed of all men the most miserable  When I look round these gloomy walls made to terrify as well as to confine us this light that only serves to shew the horrors of the place those shackles that tyranny has imposed or crime made necessary when I survey these emaciated looks and hear those groans O my friends what a glorious exchange would heaven be for these To fly through regions unconfined as air to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss to carrol over endless hymns of praise to have no master to threaten or insult us but the form of goodness himself for ever in our eyes when I think of these things death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings when I think of these things his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of my support when I think of these things what is there in life worth having when I think of these things what is there that should not be spurned away kings in their palaces should groan for such advantages  but we humbled as we are should yearn for them  And shall these things be ours Ours they will certainly be if we but try for them and what is a comfort we are shut out from many temptations that would retard our pursuit Only let us try for them and they will certainly be ours and what is still a comfort shortly too for if we look back on past life it appears but a very short span and whatever we may think of the rest of life it will yet be found of less duration as we grow older the days seem to grow shorter and our intimacy with time ever lessens the perception of his stay Then let us take comfort now for we shall soon be at our journey's end we shall soon lay down the heavy burthen laid by heaven upon us and though death the only friend of the wretched for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view and like his  horizon still flies before him yet the time will certainly and shortly come when we shall cease from our toil when the luxurious great ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth when we shall think with pleasure on our sufferings below when we shall be surrounded with all our friends or such as deserved our friendship when our bliss shall be unutterable and still to crown all unending  CHAP XI  Happier prospects begin to appear Let us be inflexible and fortune will at last change in our favour  WHEN I had thus finished and my audience was retired the gaoler who was one of the most humane of his profession hoped I would not be displeased as what he did was but his duty observing that he must be obliged to remove my son into a stronger cell but that he should be permitted to revisit me every morning I thanked him for his clemency and grasping my boy's hand bade him farewell and be mindful of the great duty that was before him  I again therefore laid me down and one of my little ones sate by my bedside reading when Mr Jenkinson entering informed me that there was news of my daughter for that she was seen by a person about two hours before in a strange gentleman's company and that they had stopt at a neighbouring village for refreshment and seemed as if returning to town He had scarce delivered this news when the gaoler came with looks of haste and pleasure to inform me that my daughter was found Moses came running in a moment after crying out that his sister Sophy was below and coming up with our old friend Mr Burchell  Just as he delivered this news my dearest girl entered and with looks almost wild with pleasure ran to kiss me in a transport of affection Her mother's tears and silence also shewed her pleasure  "Here pappa"  cried the charming girl  "here is the brave man to whom I owe my delivery to this gentleman's intrepidity I am indebted for my happiness and safety"  A kiss from Mr Burchell whose pleasure seemed even greater than hers interrupted what she was going to add  "Ah Mr Burchell"  cried I  "this is but a wretched habitation you now find us in and we are now very different from what you last saw us You were ever our friend we have long discovered our errors with regard to you and repented of our ingratitude After the vile usage you then received at my hands I am almost ashamed to behold your face yet I hope you'll forgive me as I was deceived by a base ungenerous wretch who under the mask of friendship has undone me"  "It is impossible"  replied Mr Burchell  "that I should forgive you as you never  deserved my resentment I partly saw your delusion then and as it was out of my power to restrain I could only pity it"  "It was ever my conjecture"  cried I  "that your mind was noble but now I find it so But tell me my dear child how hast thou been relieved or who the ruffians were who carried thee away"  "Indeed Sir"  replied she  "as to the villain who brought me off I am yet ignor ut For as my mamma and I were walking out he came behind us and almost before I could call for help forced me into the postchaise and in an instant the horses drove away I met several on the road to whom I cried out for assistance but they disregarded my entreaties In the mean time the ruffian himself used every art to hinder me from crying out he flattered and threatened  by turns and swore that if I continued but silent he intended no harm In the mean time I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up and whom should I perceive at some distance but your old friend Mr Burchell walking along with his usual swiftness with the great stick for which we used so much to ridicule him As soon as we came within hearing I called out to him by name and entreated his help I repeated my exclamations several times upon which with a very loud voice he bid the postillion stop but the boy took no notice but drove on with still greater speed I now thought he could never overtake us when in less than a minute I saw Mr Burchell come running up by the side of the horses and with one blow knock the postillion to the ground The horses when he was fallen soon stopt of themselves and the ruffian stepping out with oaths and menaces drew his sword and  ordered him at his peril to retire but Mr Burchell running up shivered his sword to pieces and then pursued him for near a quarter of a mile but he made his escape I was at this time come out myself willing to assist my deliverer but he soon returned to me in triumph The postillion who was recovered was going to make his escape too but Mr Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again and drive back to town Finding it impossible to resist he reluctantly complied though the wound he had received seemed to me at least to be dangerous He continued to complain of the pain as we drove along so that he at last excited Mr Burchell's compassion who at my request exchanged him for another at an inn where we called on our return"  "Welcome then"  cried I  "my child and thou her gallant deliverer a thousand  welcomes Though our chear is but wretched yet our hearts are ready to receive you And now Mr Burchell as you have delivered my girl if you think her a recompence she is yours if you can stoop to an alliance with a family so poor as mine take her obtain her consent as I know you have her heart and you have mine And let me tell you Sir that I give you no small treasure she has been celebrated for beauty it is true but that is not my meaning I give you up a treasure in her mind"  "But I suppose Sir"  cried Mr Burchell  "that you are apprized of my circumstances and of my incapacity to support her as she deserves"  "If your present objection"  replied I  "be meant as an evasion of my offer I desist but I know no man so worthy to deserve her as you and if I could give  her thousands and thousands sought her from me yet my honest brave Burchell should be my dearest choice"  To all this his silence alone seemed to give a mortifying refusal and without the least reply to my offer he demanded if we could not be furnished with refreshments from the next inn to which being answered in the affirmative he ordered them to send in the best dinner that could be provided upon such short notice He bespoke also a dozen of their best wine and some cordials for me Adding with a smile that he would stretch a little for once and tho' in a prison asserted he was never better disposed to be merry The waiter soon made his appearance with preparations for dinner a table was lent us by the gaoler who seemed remarkably assiduous the wine was disposed in order and two very welldrest dishes were brought in  My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy situation and we all seemed unwilling to damp her chearfulness by the relation But it was in vain that I attempted to appear chearful the circumstances of my unfortunate son broke through all efforts to dissemble so that I I was at last obliged to damp our mirth by relating his misfortunes and wishing that he might be permitted to share with us in this little interval of satisfaction After my guests were recovered from the consternation my account had produced I requested also that Mr Jenkinson a fellow prisoner might be admitted and the gaoler granted my request with an air of unusual submission The clanking of my son's irons was no sooner heard along the passage than his sister ran impatiently to meet him while Mr Burchell in the mean time asked me if my son's name were George to which replying in the affirmative he still continued silent As soon as my boy entered the  room I could perceive he regarded Mr Burchell with a look of astonishment and reverence  "Come on"  cried I  "my son though we are fallen very low yet providence has been pleased to grant us some small relaxation from pain Thy sister is restored to us and there is her deliverer to that brave man it is that I am indebted for yet having a daughter give him my boy the hand of friendship he deserves our warmest gratitude"  My son seemed all this while regardless of what I said and still continued fixed at respectful distance  "My dear brother"  cried his sister  "why don't you thank my good deliverer the brave should ever love each other"  He still continued his silence and astonishment till our guest at last perceived himself to be known and assuming all his  native dignity desired my son to come forward Never before had I seen any thing so truly majestic as the air he assumed upon this occasion The greatest object in the universe says a certain philosopher is a good man struggling with adversity yet there is still a greater which is the good man that comes to relieve it After he had regarded my son for some time with a superior air  "I again find'  said he  "unthinking boy that the same crime"  But here he was interrupted by one of the gaoler's servants who came to inform us that a person of distinction who had driven into town with a chariot and several attendants sent his respects to the gentleman that was with us and begged to know when he should think proper to be waited upon  "Bid the fellow wait"  cried our guest  "till I shall have leisure to receive him"  and then turning to my son  "I again find Sir"  proceeded he  "that you are guilty of the same offence  for which you once had my reproof and for which the law is now preparing its justest punishments You imagine perhaps that a contempt for your own life gives you a right to take that of another but where Sir is the difference between a duelist who hazards a life of no value and the murderer who acts with greater security Is it any diminution of the gamester's fraud when he alledges that he has staked a counter"  "Alas Sir"  cried I  "whoever you are pity the poor misguided creature for what he has done was in obedience to a deluded mother who in the bitterness of her resentment required him upon her blessing to avenge her quarrel Here Sir is the letter which will serve to convince you of her imprudence and diminish his guilt"  He took the letter and hastily read it over  "This"  says he  "though not a perfect excuse is such a palliation of his fault as induces me to forgive him And now Sir"  continued he kindly taking my son by the hand  "I see you are surprised at finding me here but I have often visited prisons upon occasions less interesting I am now come to see justice done a worthy man for whom I have the most sincere esteem I have long been a disguised spectator of thy father's benevolence I have at his little dwelling enjoyed respect uncontaminated by flattery and have received that happiness that courts could not give from the amusing simplicity round his fireside My nephew has been apprized of my intentions of coming here and I find is arrived it would be wronging him and you to condemn him without examination if  there be injury there shall be redress and this I may say without boasting that none have ever taxed the injustice of Sir William Thornhill"  We now found the personage whom we had so long entertained as an harmless amusing companion was no other than the celebrated Sir William Thornhill to whose virtues and singularities scarce any were strangers The poor Mr Burchell was in reality a man of large fortune and great interest to whom senates listened with applause and whom party heard with conviction who was the friend of his country but loyal to his king My poor wife recollecting her former familiarity seemed to shrink with apprehension but Sophia who a few moments before thought him her own now perceiving the immense distance to which he was removed by fortune was unable to conceal her tears  "Ah Sir"  cried my wife with a piteous aspect  "how is it possible that I can ever have your forgiveness the slights you received from me the last time I had the honour of seeing you at our house and the jokes which I audaciously threw out these jokes Sir I fear can never be forgiven"  "My dear good lady"  returned he with a smile  "if you had your joke I had my answer I'll leave it to all the company if mine were not as good as yours To say the truth I know no body whom I am disposed to be angry with at present but the fellow who so frighted my little girl here I had not even time to examine the rascal's person so as to describe him in an advertisement Can you tell me Sophia my dear whether you should know him again"  "Indeed Sir"  replied she  "I can't be positive yet now I recollect he had  a large mark over one of his eyebrows"  "I ask pardon madam"  interrupted Jenkinson who was by  "but be so good as to inform me if the fellow wore his own red hair"    "Yes I think so"  cried Sophia  "And did your honour"  continued he turning to Sir William  "observe the length of his legs"    "I can't be sure of their length"  cried the Baronet  "but I am convinced of their swiftness for he outran me which is what I thought few men in the kingdom could have done"    "Please your honour"  cried Jenkinson  "I know the man it is certainly the same the best runner in England he has beaten Pinwire of Newcastle Timothy Baxter is his name I know him perfectly and the very place of his retreat this moment If your honour will bid Mr Gaoler let two of his men go with me I'll engage to produce him to you in an hour at farthest"  Upon this the gaoler was called who instantly appearing Sir William demanded  if he knew him  "Yes please your honour"  reply'd the gaoler  "I know Sir William Thornhill well and every body that knows any thing of him will desire to know more of him"    "Well then"  said the Baronet  "my request is that you will permit this man and two of your servants to go upon a message by my authority and as I am in the commission of the peace I undertake to secure you"    "Your promise is sufficient"  replied the other  "and you may at a minute's warning send them over England whenever your honour thinks fit"  In pursuance of the gaoler's compliance Jenkinson was dispatched in search of Timothy Baxter while we were amused with the assiduity of our youngest boy Bill who had just come in and climbed up to Sir William's neck in order to kiss him His mother was immediately going to chastise  his familiarity but the worthy man prevented her and taking the child all ragged as he was upon his knee  "What Bill you chubby rogue"  cried he  "do you remember your old friend Burchell and Dick too my honest veteran are you here you shall find I have not forgot you"  So saying he gave each a large piece of gingerbread which the poor fellows eat very heartily as they had got that morning but a very scanty breakfast  We now sate down to dinner which was almost cold but previously my arm still continuing painful Sir William wrote a prescription for he had made the study of physic his amusement and was more than moderately skilled in the profession this being sent to an apothecary who lived in the place my arm was dressed and I found almost instantaneous relief We were waited upon at dinner by the gaoler himself who was willing to do our guest all the honour  in his power But before we had well dined another message was brought from his nephew desiring permission to appear in order to vindicate his innocence and honour with which request the Baronet complied and desired Mr Thornhill to be introduced  CHAP XII  Former benevolence now repaid with unexpected interest  MR Thornhill made his entrance with a smile which he seldom wanted and was going to embrace his uncle which the other repulsed with an air of disdain  "No fawning Sir at present"  cried the Baronet with a look of severity  "the only way to my heart is by the road of honour but here I only see complicated instances of falsehood cowardice and oppression How is it Sir that this poor man for whom I know you professed a friendship is used thus hardly His daughter vilely seduced as a recompence  for his hospitality and he himself thrown into a prison perhaps but for resenting the insult His son too whom you feared to face as a man"  "Is it possible Sir"  interrupted his nephew  "that my uncle could object that as a crime which his repeated instructions alone have persuaded me to avoid"  "Your rebuke"  cried Sir William  "is just you have acted in this instance prudently and well though not quite as your father would have done my brother indeed was the soul of honour but thouyes you have acted in this instance perfectly right and it has my warmest approbation"  "And I hope"  said his nephew  "that the rest of my conduct will not be found to deserve censure I appeared Sir with this gentleman's daughter at some places  of public amusement thus what was levity scandal called by a harsher name and it was reported that I had debauched her I waited on her father in person willing to clear the thing to his satisfaction and he received me only with insult and abuse As for the rest with regard to his being here my attorney and steward can best inform you as I commit the management of business entirely to them If he has contracted debts and is unwilling or even unable to pay them it is their business to proceed in this manner and I see no hardship or injustice in pursuing the most legal means of redress"  "If this"  cried Sir William  "be as you have stated it there is nothing unpardonable in your offence and though your conduct might have been more generous in not suffering this gentleman to be oppressed by subordinate tyranny yet it has been at least equitable"  "He cannot contradict a single particular"  replied the 'Squire  "I defy him to do so and several of my servants are ready to attest what I say Thus Sir"  continued he finding that I was silent for in fact I could not contradict him  "thus Sir my own innocence is vindicated but though at your entreaty I am ready to forgive this gentleman every other offence yet his attempts to lessen me in your esteem excite a resentment that I cannot govern And this too at a time when his son was actually preparing to take away my life this I say was such guilt that I am determined to let the law take its course I have here the challenge that was sent me and two witnesses to prove it and even though my uncle himself should dissuade me which I know he will not yet I will see public justice done and he shall suffer for it"  "Thou monster"  cried my wife  "hast thou not had vengeance enough already  but must my poor boy feel thy cruelty I hope that good Sir William will protect us for my son is as innocent as a child I am sure he is and never did harm to man"  "Madam"  replied the good man  "your wishes for his safety are not greater than mine but I am sorry to find his guilt too plain and if my nephew persists"  But the appearance of Jenkinson and the gaoler's two servants now called off our attention who entered haling in a tall man very genteelly drest and answering the description already given of the ruffian who had carried off my daughter  "Here"  cried Jenkinson pulling him in  "here we have him and if ever there was a candidate for tyburn this is one"  The moment Mr Thornhill perceived the prisoner and Jenkinson who had him  in custody he seemed to shrink back with terror His face became pale with conscious guilt and he would have withdrawn but Jenkinson who perceived his design stopt him  "What 'Squire"  cried he  "are you ashamed of your two old acquaintances Jenkinson and Baxter but this is the way that all great men forget their friends though I am resolved we will not forget you Our prisoner please your honour"  continued he turning to Sir William  "has already confessed all He declares that it was Mr Thornhill who first put him upon this affair that he gave him the cloaths he now wears to appear like a gentleman and furnished him with the postchaise The plan was laid between them that he should carry off the young lady to a place of safety and that there he should threaten and terrify her but Mr Thornhill was to come in in the mean time as if by accident to her rescue and that they should fight awhile  and then he was to run off by which Mr Thornhill would have the better opportunity of gaining her affections himself under the character of her defender"  Sir William remembered the coat to have been frequently worn by his nephew and all the rest the prisoner himself confirmed by a more circumstantial account concluding that Mr Thornhill had often declared to him that he was in love with both sisters at the same time  "Heavens"  cried Sir William  "what a viper have I been fostering in my bosom And so fond of public justice too as he seemed to be But he shall have it secure him Mr Gaoleryet hold I fear there is not legal evidence to detain him"  Upon this Mr Thornhill with the utmost humility entreated that two such abandoned wretches might not be admitted  as evidences against him but that his servants should be examined  "Your servants"  replied Sir William  "wretch call them yours no longer but come let us hear what those fellows have to say let his butler be called"  When the butler was introduced he soon perceived by his former master's looks that all his power was now over  "Tell me"  cried Sir William sternly  "have you ever seen your master and that fellow drest up in his cloaths in company together"  "Yes please your honour"  cried the butler  "a thousand times he was the man that always brought him his ladies"    "How"  interrupted young Mr Thornhill  "this to my face"    "Yes"  replied the butler  "or to any man's face To tell you a truth Master Thornhill I never either loved you or liked you and I don't care if I tell you now a piece of my mind"    "Now then"  cried Jenkinson  "tell his  honour whether you know any thing of me"    "I can't say"  replied the butler  "that I know much good of you The night that gentleman's daughter was deluded to our house you were one of them"    "So then"  cried Sir William  "I find you have brought a very fine witness to prove your innocence thou stain to humanity to associate with such wretches"  But continuing his examination  "You tell me Mr Butler that this was the person who brought him this old gentleman's daughter"    "No please your honour"  replied the butler  "he did not bring her for the 'Squire himself undertook that business but he brought the priest that pretended to marry them"    "It is but too true"  cried Jenkinson  "I cannot deny it that was the employment assigned me and I confess it to my confusion"  "Good heavens"  exclaimed the Baronet  "how every new discovery of his villainy  alarms me All his guilt is now too plain and I find his present prosecution was dictated by tyranny cowardice and revenge at my request Mr Gaoler set this young officer now your prisoner free and trust to me for the consequences I'll make it my business to set the affair in a proper light to my friend the magistrate who has committed him But where is the unfortunate young lady herself let her appear to confront this wretch I long to know by what arts he has seduced her honour Entreat her to come in Where is she"  "Ah Sir"  said I  "that question stings me to the heart I was once indeed happy in a daughter but her miseries"  Another interruption here prevented me for who should make her appearance but Miss Arabella Wilmot who was next day to have been married to Mr Thornhill Nothing could equal her surprize at seeing  Sir William and his nephew here before her for her arrival was quite accidental It happened that she and the old gentleman her father were passing through the town on their way to her aunt's who had insisted that her nuptials with Mr Thornhill should be consummated at her house but stopping for refreshment they put up at an inn at the other end of the town It was there from the window that the young lady happened to observe one of my little boys playing in the street and instantly sending a footman to bring the child to her she learnt from him some account of our misfortunes but was still kept ignorant of young Mr Thornhill's being the cause Though her father made several remonstrances on the impropriety of going to a prison to visit us yet they were ineffectual she desired the child to conduct her which he did and it was thus she surprised us at a juncture so unexpected  Nor can I go on without a reflection on those accidental meetings which though they happen every day seldom excite our surprize but upon some extraordinary occasion To what a fortuitous concurrence do we not owe every pleasure and convenience of our lives How many seeming accidents must unite before we can be cloathed or fed The peasant must be disposed to labour the shower must fall the wind fill the merchant's sail or numbers must want the usual supply  We all continued silent for some moments while my charming pupil which was the name I generally gave this young lady united in her looks compassion and astonishment which gave new finishings to her beauty  "Indeed my dear Mr Thornhill"  cried she to the 'Squire who she supposed was come here to succour and not to oppress us  "I take it a little unkindly that you should come here without  me or never inform me of the situation of a family so dear to us both you know I should take as much pleasure in contributing to the relief of my reverend old master here whom I shall ever esteem as you can But I find that like your uncle you take a pleasure in doing good in secret"  "He find pleasure in doing good"  cried Sir William interrupting her  "No my dear his pleasures are as base as he is You see in him madam as complete a villain as ever disgraced humanity A wretch who after having deluded this poor man's daughter after plotting against the innocence of her sister has thrown the father into prison and the eldest son into fetters because he had courage to face his betrayer And give me leave madam now to congratulate you upon an escape from the embraces of such a monster"  "O goodness"  cried the lovely girl  "how have I been deceived Mr Thornhill informed me for certain that this gentleman's eldest son Captain Primrose was gone off to America with his newmarried lady"  "My sweetest miss"  cried my wife  "he has told you nothing but falsehoods My son George never left the kingdom nor never was married Tho' you have forsaken him he has always loved you too well to think of any body else and I have heard him say he would die a batchellor for your sake"  She then proceeded to expatiate upon the sincerity of her son's passion she set his duel with Mr Thornhill in a proper light from thence she made a rapid digression to the 'Squire's debaucheries his pretended marriages and ended with a most insulting picture of his cowardice  "Good heavens"  cried Miss Wilmot  "how very near have I been to the brink of ruin But how great is my pleasure to have escaped it Ten thousand falsehoods has this gentleman told me He had at last art enough to persuade me that my promise to the only man I esteemed was no longer binding since he had been unfaithful By his falsehoods I was taught to detest one equally brave and generous"  But by this time my son was freed from the incumbrances of justice Mr Jenkinson also who had acted as his valet de chambre had dressed up his hair and furnished him with whatever was necessary to make a genteel appearance He now therefore entered handsomely drest in his regimentals and without vanity for I am above it he appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress  As he entered he made Miss Wilmot a modest and distant bow for he was not as yet acquainted with the change which the eloquence of his mother had wrought in his favour But no decorums could restrain the impatience of his blushing mistress to be forgiven Her tears her looks all contributed to discover the real sensations of her heart for having forgotten her former promise and having suffered herself to be deluded by an impostor My son appeared amazed at her condescension and could scarce believe it real  "Sure madam"  cried he  "this is but delusion I can never have merited this To be blest thus is to be too happy"    "No Sir"  replied she  "I have been deceived basely deceived else nothing could have ever made me unjust to my promise You know my friendship you have long known it but forget what I have done and as you once had my warmest vows of  constancy you shall now have them repeated and be assured that if your Arabella cannot be yours she shall never be another's"    "And no other's you shall be"  cried Sir William  "if I have any influence with your father"  This hint was sufficient for my son Moses who immediately flew to the inn where the old gentleman was to inform him of every circumstance that had happened But in the mean time the 'Squire perceiving that he was on every side undone now finding that no hopes were left from flattery or dissimulation concluded that his wisest way would be to turn and face his pursuers Thus laying aside all shame he appeared the open hardy villain  "I find then"  cried he  "that I am to expect no justice here but I am resolved it shall be done me You shall know Sir"  turning to Sir William  "I am no  longer a poor dependant upon your favours I scorn them Nothing can keep Miss Wilmot's fortune from me which I thank her father's assiduity is pretty large The articles and a bond for her fortune are signed and safe in my possession It was her fortune not her person that induced me to wish for this match and possessed of the one let whose will take the other"  This was an alarming blow Sir William was sensible of the justice of his claims for he had been instrumental in drawing up the marriage articles himself Miss Wilmot therefore perceiving that her fortune was irretrievably lost turning to my son she asked if the loss of fortune could lessen her value to him  "Though fortune"  said she  "is out of my power at least I have my hand to give"  "And that madam"  cried her real lover  "was indeed all that you ever had to give at least all that I ever thought worth the acceptance And I now protest my Arabella by all that's happy your want of fortune this moment encreases my pleasure as it serves to convince my sweet girl of my sincerity"  Mr Wilmot now entering he seemed not a little pleased at the danger his daughter had just escaped and readily consented to a dissolution of the match But finding that her fortune which was secured to Mr Thornhill by bond would not be given up nothing could exceed his disappointment He now saw that his money must all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own He could bear his being a rascal but to want an equivalent to his daughter's fortune was wormwood He sate therefore for some minutes employed in the most mortifying speculations till Sir William attempted to  lessen his anxiety  "I must confess Sir"  cried he  "that your present disappointment does not entirely displease me Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished But tho' the young lady cannot be rich she has still a competence sufficient to give content Here you see an honest young soldier who is willing to take her without fortune they have long loved each other and for the friendship I bear his father my interest shall not be wanting for his promotion Leave then that ambition which disappoints you and for once admit haphappiness which courts your acceptance"  "Sir William"  replied the old gentleman  "be assured I never yet forced her inclinations nor will I now If she still continues to love this young gentleman let her have him with all my heart There is still thank heaven some fortune left and your promise will make it  something more Only let my old friend here meaning me give me a promise of settling six thousand pounds upon my girl if ever he should come to his fortune and I am ready this night to be the first to join them together"  As it now remained with me to make the young couple happy I readily gave a promise of making the settlement he required which to one who had such little expectations as I was no great favour We had now therefore the satisfaction of seeing them fly into each other's arms in a transport  "After all my misfortunes"  cried my son George  "to be thus rewarded Sure this is more than I could ever have presumed to hope for To be possessed of all that's good and after such an interval of pain My warmest wishes could never rise so high"    "Yes my George"  returned his  lovely bride  "now let the wretch take my fortune since you are happy without it so am I O what an exchange have I made from the basest of men to the dearest bestLet him enjoy our fortune I now can be happy even in indigence"    "And I promise you"  cried the 'Squire with a malicious grin  "that I shall be very happy with what you despise"    "Hold hold Sir"  cried Jenkinson  "there are two words to that bargain As for that lady's fortune Sir you shall never touch a single stiver of it Pray your honour"  continued he to Sir William"  can the 'Squire have this lady's fortune if he be married to another"    "How can you make such a simple demand"  replied the Baronet  "undoubtedly he cannot"    "I am sorry for that"  cried Jenkinson  "for as this gentleman and I have been old fellow sporters I have a friendship for him But I must declare well as I love him that his contract is not worth a tobacco  stopper for he is married already"    "You lie like a rascal"  returned the 'Squire who seemed rouzed by this insult  "I never was legally married to any woman"    "Indeed begging your honour's pardon"  replied the other  "you were and I hope you will shew a proper return of friendship to your own honest Jenkinson who brings you a wife and if the company restrains their curiosity a few minutes they shall see her"  So saying he went off with his usual celerity and left us all unable to form any probable conjecture as to his design  "Ay let him go"  cried the 'Squire  "whatever else I may have done I defy him there I am too old now to be frightened with squibs"  "I am surprised"  said the Baronet  "what the fellow can intend by this Some low piece of humour I suppose"    "Perhaps Sir"  replied I  "he may have  a more serious meaning For when we reflect on the various schemes this gentleman laid to seduce innocence perhaps some one more artful than the rest has been found able to deceive him When we consider what numbers he has ruined how many parents now feel with anguish the infamy and the contamination which he has brought into their families it would not surprise me if some one of themAmazement Do I see my lost daughter Do I hold her It is it is my life my happiness I thought thee lost my Olivia yet still I hold theeand still shalt thou live to bless me"  The warmest transports of the fondest lover were not greater than mine when I saw him introduce my child and held my daughter in my arms whose silence only spoke her raptures  "And art thou returned to me my darling"  cried I  "to be my comfort in age"    "That she is"  cried Jenkinson  "and make much of her for she is your  own honourable child and as honest a woman as any in the whole room let the other be who she will And as for you 'Squire as sure as you stand there this young lady is your lawful wedded wife And to convince you that I speak nothing but truth here is the licence by which you were married together"  So saying he put the licence into the Baronet's hands who read it and found it perfect in every respect  "And now gentlemen"  continued he  "I find you are surprised at all this but a few words will explain the difficulty That there 'Squire of renown for whom I have a great friendship but that's between ourselves has often employed me in doing odd little things for him Among the rest he commissioned me to procure him a false licence and a false priest in order to deceive this young lady But as I was very much his friend what did I do but went and got a true licence and a true priest  and married them both as fast as the cloth could make them Perhaps you'll think it was generosity that made me do all this But no To my shame I confess it my only design was to keep the licence and let the 'Squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper and so make him come down whenever I wanted money"  A burst of pleasure now seemed to fill the whole apartment our joy reached even to the common room where the prisoners themselves sympathized  And shook their chains  In transport and rude harmony  Happiness expanded upon every face and even Olivia's cheek seemed flushed with pleasure To be thus restored to reputation to friends and fortune at once was a rapture sufficient to stop the progress of decay and restore former health and vivacity But perhaps among all there was not one  who felt sincerer pleasure than I Still holding the dearloved child in my arms I asked my heart if these transports were not delusion  How could you"  cried I turning to Mr Jenkinson  "how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death But it matters not my pleasure at finding her again is more than a recompence for the pain"  "As to your question"  replied Jenkinson  "that is easily answered I thought the only probable means of freeing you from prison was by submitting to the 'Squire and consenting to his marriage with the other young lady But these you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living there was therefore no other method to bring things to bear but by persuading you that she was dead I prevailed on your wise to join in the deceit and we have not had a fit opportunity of undeceiving you till now"  In the whole assembly now there only appeared two faces that did not glow with transport Mr Thornhill's assurance had entirely forsaken him he now saw the gulph of infamy and want before him and trembled to take the plunge He therefore fell on his knees before his uncle and in a voice of piercing misery implored compassion Sir William was going to spurn him away but at my request he raised him and after pausing a few moments  "Thy vices crimes and ingratitude"  cried he  "deserve no tenderness yet thou shalt not be entirely forsaken a bare competence shall be supplied to support the wants of life but not its follies This young lady thy wife shall be put in possession of a third part of that fortune which once was thine and from her tenderness alone thou art to expect any extraordinary supplies for the future"  He was going to express his gratitude for such kindness in a set speech but the  Baronet prevented him by bidding him not aggravate his meanness which was already but too apparent He ordered him at the same time to be gone and from all his former domestics to chuse one such as he should think proper which was all that should be granted to attend him  As soon as he left us Sir William very politely stept up to his new niece with a a smile and wished her joy His example was followed by Miss Wilmot and her father my wife too kissed her daughter with much affection as to use her own expression she was now made an honest woman of Sophia and Moses followed in turn and even our benefactor Jenkinson desired to be admitted to that honour Our satisfaction seemed scarce capable of increase Sir William whose greatest pleasure was in doing good now looked round with a countenance open as the sun and saw nothing but joy in the looks of all except that of  my daughter Sophia who for some reasons we could not comprehend did not seem perfectly satisfied  "I think now"  cried he with a smile  "that all the company except one or two seem perfectly happy There only remains an act of justice for me to do You are sensible Sir"  continued he turning to me  "of the obligations we both owe Mr Jenkinson for his late assiduity in detecting a scoundrel It is but just we should both reward him for it Your youngest daughter Miss Sophia will I am sure make him very happy and he shall have from me five hundred pounds as her fortune and upon this I am sure they can live very comfortably together Come Miss Sophia what say you to this match of my making Will you have him"  My poor girl seemed almost sinking into her mother's arms at the hideous proposal  "Have him Sir"  cried she faintly  "No Sir never"    What"  cried he again  "not have Mr Jenkinson your benefactor an handsome young fellow with five hundred pounds and good expectations"    "I beg Sir"  returned she scarce able to speak  "that you'll desist and not make me so very wretched"    "Was ever such obstinacy known"  cried he again  "to refuse a man whom the family has such infinite obligations to who has preserved your sister What not have him"    "No Sir never"  replied she angrily  "I'd sooner die first"    "If that be the case then"  cried he  "if you will not have himI think I must have you myself"  And so saying he caught her to his breast with ardour  "My loveliest my most sensible of girls"  cried he  "how could you ever think your own Burchell could deceive you or that Sir William Thornhill could ever cease to admire a mistress that loved him for himself alone I have for some years sought for a woman who a stranger to my fortune  could think that I had merit as a man After having tried in vain even amongst the pert and the ugly how great at last must be my rapture to have made a conquest over such sense and such heavenly beauty"  Then turning to Jenkinson  "As I cannot Sir part with this young lady myself for she has taken a fancy to the cut of my face all the recompence I can make is to give you her fortune and you may call upon my steward tomorrow for five hundred pounds"  Thus we had all our compliments to repeat and Lady Thornhill underwent the same round of ceremony that her sisters had done before In the mean time Sir William's gentleman appeared to tell us that the equipages were ready to carry us to the inn where every thing was prepared for our reception My wife and I led the van and left those gloomy mansions of sorrow The generous Baronet ordered forty pounds to be distributed among the prisoners and  Mr Wilmot induced by his example gave half that sum We were received below by the shouts of the villagers and I saw and shook by the hand two or three of my honest parishioners who were among the number They attended us to our inn where a sumptuous entertainment was provided and coarser provisions distributed in great quantities among the populace  After supper as my spirits were exhausted by the alternation of pleasure and pain which they had sustained during the day I asked permission to withdraw and leaving the company in the midst of their mirth as soon as I found myself alone I poured out my heart in gratitude to the giver of joy as well as of sorrow and then slept undisturbed till morning  CHAP XIII  The Conclusion  THE next morning as soon as I awaked I found my eldest son sitting by my bedside who came to encrease my joy with another turn of fortune in my favour First having released me from the settlement that I had made the day before in his favour he let me know that my merchant who had failed in town was arrested at Antwerp and there had given up effects to a much greater amount than what was due to his creditors My boy's generosity pleased me almost as much as this unlooked for good fortune But I had some doubts whether I  ought in justice to accept his offer While I was pondering upon this Sir William entered the room to whom I communicated my doubts His opinion was that as my son was already possessed of a very affluent fortune by his marriage I might accept his offer without any hesitation His business however was to inform me that as he had the night before sent for the licences and expected them every hour he hoped that I would not refuse my assistance in making all the company happy that morning A footman entered while we were speaking to tell us that the messenger was returned and as I was by this time ready I went down where I found the whole company as merry as affluence and innocence could make them However as they were now preparing for a very solemn ceremony their laughter entirely displeased me I told them of the grave becoming and sublime deportment they should assume upon this mystical occasion and read them two homilies and a thesis of my own  composing in order to prepare them Yet they still seemed perfectly refractory and ungovernable Even as we were going along to church to which I led the way all gravity had quite forsaken them and I was often tempted to turn back in indignation In church a new dilemma arose which promised no easy solution This was which couple should be married first my son's bride warmly insisted that Lady Thornhill that was to be should take the lead but this the other refused with equal ardour protesting she would not be guilty of such rudeness for the world The argument was supported for some time between both with equal obstinacy and good breeding But as I stood all this time with my book ready I was at last quite tired of the contest and shutting it  "I perceive"  cried I  "that none of you have a mind to be married and I think we had as good go back again for I suppose  there will be no business done here today"  This at once reduced them to reason The Baronet and his Lady were first married and then my son and his lovely partner  I had previously that morning given orders that a coach should be sent for my honest neighbour Flamborough and his family by which means upon our return to the inn we had the pleasure of finding the two Miss Flamboroughs alighted before us Mr Jenkinson gave his hand to the eldest and my son Moses led up the other and I have since found that he has taken a real liking to the girl and my consent and bounty he shall have whenever he thinks proper to demand them We were no sooner returned to the inn but numbers of my parishioners hearing of my success came to congratulate me but among the rest were those who rose to rescue me and whom  I formerly rebuked with such sharpness I told the story to Sir William my soninlaw who went out and reproved them with great severity but finding them quite disheartened by his harsh reproof he gave them half a guinea a piece to drink his health and raise their dejected spirits  Soon after this we were called to a very genteel entertainment which was drest by Mr Thornhill's cook And it may not be improper to observe with respect to that gentleman that he now resides in quality of companion at a relation's house being very well liked and seldom sitting at the sidetable except when there is no room at the other for they make no stranger of him His time is pretty much taken up in keeping his relation who is a little melancholy in spirits and in learning to blow the Frenchhorn My eldest daughter however still remembers him with regret and she has  even told me though I make a great secret of it that when he reforms she may be brought to relent But to return for I am not apt to digress thus when we were to sit down to dinner our ceremonies were going to be renewed The question was whether my eldest daughter as being a matron should not sit above the two young brides but the debate was cut short by my son George who proposed that the company should sit indiscriminately every gentleman by his lady This was received with great approbation by all excepting my wife who I could perceive was not perfectly satisfied as she expected to have had the pleasure of sitting at the head of the table and carving all the meat for all the company But notwithstanding this it is impossible to describe our good humour I can't say whether we had more wit amongst us now than usual but I am certain we had more laughing which answered the end as well One jest I particularly  remember old Mr Wilmot drinking to Moses whose head was turned another way my son replied  "Madam I thank you"  Upon which the old gentleman winking upon the rest of the company observed that he was thinking of his mistress At which jest I thought the two miss Flamboroughs would have died with laughing As soon as dinner was over according to my old custom I requested that the table might be taken away to have the pleasure of seeing all my family assembled once more by a chearful fireside My two little ones sat upon each knee the rest of the company by their partners I had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for all my cares were over my pleasure was unspeakable It now only remained that my gratitude in good fortune should exceed my former submission in adversity  FINIS
