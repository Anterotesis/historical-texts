INTESTINE WAR  By  THOMAS VAUGHAN  A M Vicar of ECCLES in  Lancashire  The King shall rejoice in thy Strength O Lord exceeding glad shall he be of thy Salvation  Psal xxi  LONDON  Printed for the AUTHOR and are to be Sold by WILLIAM SANDBY at the  Ship  opposite to  St Dunstan's Church  in  Fleetstreet    Price Sixpence  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EARL  GOWER  Viscount TRENTHAM AND LORD PRIVYSEAL  c  THE FOLLOWING DISCOURSE Is most humbly dedicated By His LORDSHIP'S  Most dutiful Most obedient And much obliged Humble Servant  THOMAS VAUGHAN  SAMUEL XII  Only fear the Lord and serve him in Truth with all your Heart for consider how great Things he hath done for you  IF all the Affairs of this lower World were either whirled about by the Giddiness of Chance or entirely go∣verned by the Sullenness of Fate it would strike a Damp upon all our Spirits and this World to all rational Beings that can fear and estimate all future Contin∣gencies would be a most gloomy and melancholy Place  And if all the wonderful and surpri∣sing Revolutions in this Life depended upon the Policy and Wisdom of those  that are the Agents in bringing mighty Things to pass since the greatest Weights many times are supported by the most slender Wires and Success in all extraor∣dinary Undertakings depends upon the happy Concurrences of innumerable Ac∣didents upon favourable Seasons and a thousand Circumstances as various and uncertain as the Weather the nicest Politicians would be lost and disap∣pointed and they in the Psalmist's Phrase would  reel to and fro  and be  at their Wits end  But how wise soever vain Men would be this World is no more governed than it was created by Chance and he that made it is only able to govern it We are neither under the Power of Chance nor determined by positive and inexorable Fate we do not depend upon politick Institutions but are now assembled to give Glory unto the Great God who rules the Armies of Heaven and the In∣habitants of the lower Regions whose Power is infinite and whose Mercy is over all his Works who  is the Hope of  all that dwell on the Earth and of them that remain in the broad Sea  Ps lxv  The Lord is King the Earth may be glad thereof yea the Multitude of the Isles may be glad thereof  Ps xcvii  We will re∣joice in thy Salvation and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God We will offer unto him the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving and tell out his Works with Gladness  Ps cvii And no Nation under Hea∣ven had ever more Reason to do so than we have upon this present Solemnity  And the signal Instances of God's Pro∣vidence are so illustriously visible that we cannot but with the deepest Grati∣tude adore him  that sitteth above the Water Floods and remaineth a King for ever  Ps xxix  Oh that Men would praise the Lord for his Goodness and de∣clare the Wonders that he doth for the Chil∣dren of Men  Ps cvii  In order to this I would earnestly re∣commend the Advice of  Samuel  a wise an experienced a faithful Governor who scorned to be bribed or to raise his For∣tunes  upon the Ruins of the People who abhorred all Artifices to enrich himself and solemnly appeals to all the People as Witnesses of his Integrity  Here I am  produce your Evidences I offer myself to a publick Trial  before the Lord and be∣fore his Anointed  Ver  Whose Ox have I taken or whose Ass have I taken or whom have I defrauded whom have I oppressed or at whose Hand have I re∣ceived any Bribe to blind mine Eyes there∣with and I will restore it you  And he received this publick Testimony  Thou hast not defrauded us neither hast thou taken ought of any Man's Hand  And they ratify the Sentence  the Lord is Wit∣ness  This admirable Person who had long governed them with such Courage and Fidelity that the worst of his Enemies could in no Case charge him with Maleadministration yet all his Merits were ungratefully slighted and the People that never want Occasion to pick Quar∣rels with their Governor whilst they ac∣quit the Judge yet murmur at his Age  for that had disabled him to travel his usual Circuits and they charged his Sons for perverting Judgment and he must re∣sign the Government to please the People But these high Provocations had no ill Effect upon him Oh the vast Differ∣ence betwixt those that have no Aims but the publick Good and those that have private Interests of their own to serve He chearfully resigns it but with unpa∣ralleled condescending Goodness after he shewed them that he was still the Favourite of Heaven how ungratefully soever they used him upon Earth At his powerful Prayers God terrified them with Thunder and softened them with Rain and prepared them for the most concerning Advice  Notwithstanding the highest Ingratitude and Barbarity to his Person and Family the brave aged Judge thus addresses him∣self to all the People  As for me God for∣bid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you  Ver  All the Injuries that they had done him could not raise the least Thought of Revenge he would not offend Al∣mighty God by any thing that looked like Resentment Let them despise his Council if they pleased yet he who was very well acquainted with what would most contribute to a national Prosperity after he had excellently reasoned before the Lord of the righteous Acts that he did to them and to their Fathers leaves this Advice with them  Only fear the Lord and serve him in Truth with all your Hearts for consider how great Things he has done for you  Permit me therefore to reflect upon these several Parts which are expressed in the Text  First  The great Things God hath done for us  Secondly  The Duty of considering how great they are  Thirdly  The Obligation that lies upon us to  fear and serve him in Truth with all our Hearts that hath wrought such wonderful Works  Should I look back to former Genera∣tions and peruse the Histories of our Church and Nation both the one and the other have subsisted by Miracles and the Indications of God Almighty's Goodness have been writ in the brightest and the clearest Characters writ as it were with a Sunbeam with equal Per∣spicuity and Certainty that we have not been left to Guesses and Conjectures But we might upon sure Grounds take up the Expressions of the Royal Prophet  Ps  xxxi  Thou hast O God shewed us marvellous Kindness in a strong City in thy holy Church  And that Church may apply those Words to itself  The Lord is my Rock and my Fortress and my Deli∣verer my Shield the Horn of my Salva∣tion my high Tower and my Refuge my Saviour  every Thing that can imply Se∣curity and Protection  Ps  xviii  For first if this be a Character of the Divine Aid that God lets Things come to the utmost Extremity before he makes  bare his Arm  and so the Psalmist in a very pathetical but unusual Address seems instead of petitioning to dictate and prescribe  Thou shalt arise and have Mercy upon Sion for why The Time is come to favour her yea the set Time is come and why Thy Servants think upon her Stones and it pities them to see her in the Dust  Ps cii  And if it be a very good Reason why God should then appear that they may know that this is thy Hand and thou Lord hast done it I need not look abroad for foreign Instances since we have so many flagrant ones at Home  We cannot forget how miserably we were distressed on every Side without were Fightings and within were Fears we all lay trembling under ambiguous Expectations impatiently waiting the Event of the Enemies Attack by Sea or  Land And when vast Armies were ready to invade us and our never enough to be lamented Divisions gave Force and Spirit to their Enterprizes all their san∣guine Hopes were wonderfully disap∣pointed by Him that hath the secret Springs of Nature in his Hands and can turn and manage them as he pleases The Winds kept the formidable Navies in their Harbours and they could not move without his Permission whom the Winds and the Sea obey  Secondly  It is another evident Cha∣racter of God Almighty's appearing for a Nation when several Events that are managed by different Persons and in dif∣ferent Places do happily conspire to com∣pleat a national Joy  When the Illustrious young Hero Duke  WILLIAM  Generalissimo of his Ma∣jesty's Forces in  NorthBritain  had spent the Season of the Year so far that he had been fatigued with long Marches and the People were faint and weary that then he should have the  Courage to attempt and be successful in so difficult an Enterprize as to storm strong Garrisons and take fortified Towns and slay and take Prisoners at the Battle of  StraghallenMoor  near  CullodenHouse  above three thousand Rebels and six hundred Prisoners and put the rest to Flight when the Rebels were superior in Number to us was a grateful Sur∣prize to all that heard it  Blessed be the Lord who did not give us as a Prey unto their Teeth This is the Lord's Doings and it is marvellous in our Eyes for which we will rejoice and give Thanks  And we cannot but break out in the famous Epinikion of the celebrated  Deborah  Judges v  So let all thy Enemies perish O Lord But let them that love him be as the Sun when he goeth forth in his Might  What an amazing tho' joyful Sight must it be to the King's Army to see the robust Highland Rebels those Gy∣gantick Sons of  Anach  fall before the  British  Fire like sturdy Oaks reft before a Sheet of irresistable Lightening Thanks  be to God who hath given us the Vic∣tory over the Enemies of his true Reli∣gion established amongst us Enemies whose wicked Designs were to set up Superstition and Popery Idolatry and arbitrary Power in its stead  For they intended Mischief against thee and ima∣gined such a Device as they were not able to perform Therefore didst thou put them to Flight and the Strings of thy Bow hast thou made ready against them Be thou exalted Lord in thy own Strength so will we sing and praise thy Power  Ps xxi But as if  Europe  was not a Theatre wide enough for the  English  Triumphs they are extended to the remotest Regions  CapeBreton  in  NorthAmerica  has seen and felt the the  English  Courage and those Vessels of the  French  which were looked on as invincible have been taken  Thirdly  Another Character of God Al∣mighty's appearing for a People is when some of the  Nimrods  some of the suc∣cessful Troublers of the World that come up to the Prophet  Isaiah  's elegant Descrip∣tion  Chap xiv  Thou saidst in thy Heart I will ascend into Heaven and I will exalt my Throne above the Stars of God I will ascend above the Heights of the Clouds I will be like the Most High  That resolve to extend their Empires and aim at Universal Monarchy by Fraud and Violence by Blood and Rapine that are swelled with Panegyricks and flattered by Devices whilst they are compared to the vast Luminaries of Hea∣ven and are told that they can no more be interrupted in their Victories and Triumphs than the Course of the Sun can be arrested When such a Prince as this feels the Weight of that Omni∣potence which he has defy'd when his powerful Navies are disabled and his Treasures exhausted and he restrained from his bloody Persecutions it is na∣tural to apply in the Prophet's Words  How art thou fallen from Heaven O Lucifer Sun of the Morning Is this the Man that made the Earth to trem∣ble that did shake Kingdoms that made the World as a Wilderness and destroyed the Cities thereof For if the Lord of  Hosts do purpose who shall disannul it and if his Hand be stretched out who shall turn it back  Isa xiv  So that if the Seasonableness of Events when Things are almost at a Crisis if the Concurrence of various prosperous Events in distant Places and Countries and Nations and the Preservation of Persons of that Figure and Eminency that the Success does depend very much upon them as the proper Instruments to procure it If the stemming the impe∣tuous Torrent and putting a Check to the Overflowing of Ungodliness Rebel∣lion and Oppression and reducing these extravagant and exorbitant Plunderers and Rebels If these be Employments worthy of Providence  Not unto us O Lord not unto us but to thy great Name be ascri∣bed the Glory and Praise  Psal cxv We have Reason to conclude that God has done great Things for us Which was the first Part I proposed to speak to  I now proceed to the second  The Duty of considering how great they are  How great are the Calamities we are freed from How great is the Happiness that we enjoy Both the one and the other require our calm and serious Reflections as we would escape the Prophet  Isaiah  's severe but just Reproof  Isa  v  The Harp and the Viol the Tabret and the Pipe and Wine are in their Feasts but they regard not the Work of the Lord neither consider the Operations of his Hands  Is it nothing in our Eyes that God hath shewed a more distinguishing Care of us than of any Nation in the whole World besides that he hath so fre∣quently interposed and snatched us from between the very Teeth and Jaws of the Destroyer  I need not lead you into antient His∣tory I must prescribe some Limits for I would not launch into a Sea of Matter  Be pleased to consider how lamen∣table our Case had been if the united Powers of  France  and  Spain  had as much disabled our naval Forces as we have done theirs since the War first broke out Had their Success been equal to ours how miserable beyond Expression had our Condition been A powerful Navy are the best Walls that can en∣compass an Island It is an illustrious and a terrible Defence It is our Glory at Home it is our Honour and Security Abroad It looks in our Channel like a lovely Valley of tall Cedars It hath a sweet and awful and majestick Pre∣sence  And if this which God of his infinite Mercy forbid should ever be destroyed how wretched how contemptible how weak how poor and inconsiderable a Nation should we be How would our neighbouring Kingdoms clap their Hands and hiss at us How should we become a Byword and a Proverb of Reproach to all that are round about us  Is it nothing to us that our restless our powerful our implacable Enemies have not yet been able to extirpate the Northern Heresy as they stile it that is the Protestant Religion Neither by open Violence nor insidious and treacherous Attempts That with all their Art they have not been able to root up our Foun∣dations and introduce Superstition and Idolatry and destroy the Products of the blessed Reformation which consists in rejecting what for many Years had been superadded to the Christian Religion and received its glorious Finishing from  an  IMMORTAL QUEEN whose Memory grows every Year more illustrious and whose Name at so great a Distance is poured out like precious Ointment and sheds a refreshing Fragrancy upon all the People  Is it nothing that our civil Rights are inviolably secured That we enjoy the Fruit of our Ancestors Labours and the Effects of our own Industry That our admirable Constitution and our ex∣cellent  Laws render us happy to the Envy of our Neighbours as happy as good Men could desire to be and as se∣cure from bad as the Justice and the Wisdom of the Laws can make us  Is it nothing that the Seasons of the Year which were lately so strangely al∣tered that the heavenly Bodies seemed angry and displeased and refused their favourable Aspects Ill News and bad Weather made Men restless and uneasy and the great Reviver of Mankind the Sun looked sullenly and was generally wrapt up in dismal Clouds Is it no∣thing that our Scarcity fresh in all your Memories is turned into Plenty That some Men begin to repine at it as their Burden and complain as vehemently for the Cheapness of the Fruits of the Earth as they did not long since for the Scar∣city and Dearness of them O consider this and lay it close to your Hearts and improve it in your most devout and grate∣ful Acknowledgments  And let it always be remembered for the Honour of this Day  When Cha∣racters engraved in Brass shall disap∣pear as if they were written in Dust when Elogies committed to the Trust of Marbles shall be illegible as whis∣pered Accents when Pyramids dis∣solved shall want themselves a Monu∣ment to evidence they were once so much as Ruin  I say let it be re∣corded for the Honour of this Day  let it be wrote with an Iron Pen and Lead in the Rock for ever  Job xix that the Battle near  CullodenHouse April  was terrible and decisive that the Highland Rebels were conquered that the  French  who joined them were taken Prisoners that those to whom Quarter was given were ungrateful and that his ROYAL HIGHNESS  WILLIAM  Duke of  Cumberland  Generalissimo of the  British  Forces at that Battle behaved with the Conduct and Bravery of an Hero  Vid  Life of  Scipio Africanus  by  Photius  p      It is observable that our Church in her  Benedicete  calls upon Darkness itself to praise the Lord The Recollection therefore of our former Disasters is not inconsistent with a Thanksgiving God grant it may fix and settle the strong and lasting Obligations that lie upon us devoutly to fear him who has wrought such wonderful Works for us Which is the last Part of this present Under∣taking  Altho' the omnipotent Power and the infinite Justice of God seem to be the only Objects of our Fear yet there is an Expression in  Hosea  iii  They shall fear the Lord and his Goodness  Tremble at the undeserved and stupendous Emana∣tions of it and dread the Abuse of it in any kind For the Transports of Success have sometimes more terrible Effects than the Desolations of War And may that never be said of us which the Prophet  Jeremy  upbraids the  Jews  with  Chap  vii  Ver    We are delivered to do all these Abominations  Good God delivered to  steal to murder to commit Adultery to swear falsely to burn Incense to  Baal  and walk after other Gods For these are the flaming Guilts that the Prophet charges home upon them Why the Saws and Harrows the Engines of Slavery and Cap∣tivity had been much more eligible than a Deliverance thus employed God Al∣mighty planted Fear in all our Natures with a gracious Design to make us wise He has placed that Passion as a wakeful Centinel to discern at a Distance the Approaches of our Enemies to see when and which Way they come and give us Cautions to avoid them or to prepare for their Attacks  Only fear the Lord  there∣fore as the Text directs  and serve him in Truth with all your Hearts for con∣sider how great Things he has done for you  Let it never be said of us that we ble∣mish our Festival by Intemperance and Excess by Lewdness and Prophaness Let us observe it with all imaginable Decency as those that fear their God and honour their Prince Let not our extravagant  Behaviour at our Feasting kindle God's Wrath against us These joyful Days should engage us in all charitable Offices Let us open both our Hands and our Hearts and send Portions to the Poor that there may be no Heart sad when God has given us such a triumphant Oc∣casion for our publick Joy And the sin∣cerest Expressions of it are discovered in  serving him in Truth with all our Hearts  To him our most gracious and mer∣ciful God our Shield and our Rock and our mighty Deliverer who hath set us free from the Northern Rebels and we hope and trust from  French  Tyranny and Popish Superstition a Yoke which neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear who hath frustrated the Counsels and blasted the Designs of wicked and unreasonable Men and made their mis∣chievous Councils and Devices to be of none Effect who brings to light the hid∣den Things of Darkness and hath hither∣to preserved our Religion and civil Inte∣rests in Despight of all the malicious and restless Designs of our Adversaries  Unto God who hath saved us with so great Salvation let us give Thanks from the Ground of the Heart And that he may accept this Sacrifice of Praise I shall once more entreat you to comply with the Advice in the Text for fear of the Judg∣ments threatened in the following Verse  Only fear the Lord and serve him in Truth with all your Hearts for consider how great Things he has done for you But if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be de∣stroyed both ye and your King  FINIS  The following Sermons printed for and sold by  WILLIAM SANDBY  at the  Ship  overagainst  St Dunstan  's Church in  Fleetstreet  I  THE Gospel an actual Friend to the Liberties of
