 ANIMADVERSIONS On a Late PAMPHLET INTITULED The New Arian Reprov'd  SInce there is a Pamphlet intituled the  New Arian Reprov'd  just Publish'd before my Four Volumes come out I shall make a few tho' very short  Animadversions  thereon Accordingly omitting several injudicious and unfair Passages I Observe That if I as an Heretick have written too insolently my Antagonists as Orthodox should do better and thereby shew how Athanasianism disposes Men to Christian Meekness and Humility more than Arianism Which yet I dare say neither this Author nor Mr  Mattair  and least of all Dr  Edwards  of  Oxford  have done  p    That my plainness and boldness in reproving the dangerous Errors remaining in our Church is interpreted an high  Affront  Whereas I take it to be the greatest Kindness I can do her I hope this Author does not suppose he affronts his Auditors every time he plainly and boldly rebukes them  p    c  I shall willingly allow this Author several whole Years to collect the Tenth part of the Testimonies for Orthodoxy in the Two first Centuries that I did in a few Months for Arianism▪ Nor am I at all unwilling to join Issue with him in the very same proportion for the Third Century also provided he will not produce those Testimonies that solely depend on  Athanasius  or a few  of his followers without nay against all the other and better Evidence about them What is here said about Dr  Grabes Essay    p    c  and my  New Theory  I shall not repeat but only desire the impartial Readers careful perusal of my  Remarks  on that  Essay  and my  Second Edition  of that  Theory  before such Reflections have any Weight with him And I must declare how reproachful soever this Author esteems it in me yet that I ever resolve to own and correct all my mistakes assoon as ever they appear to be such in all my Writings and by that means do hope to render those Writings at last much more Correct and Undenyable while the opposite vain Affectation in controversy Writers of justifying every Expression and Conjecture even after plain Evidence is produc'd to the contrary hinders their own Improvement and makes them still propagate Error among Mankind Sure those Learned Men who mainly recommend the three first Centuries as the Standard of antient Christianity  p    cannot properly include the Council of  Nice  belonging to the fourth  p    c  We have here a mighty Stir about this Council of  Nice  and how much 'tis to be prefer'd to other Councils As if there was no Passion nor Heat nor worldly Concern nor Court Management at that Council at all but the whole was peaceably debated and all guided by the good Spirit of God Which if this Author can believe he may do as he pleases while I am sure the Histories thereof how partial soever on its side give us very different Accounts And whatever that Council determin'd we are to believe no more of it than what is proved by the Sacred and Primitive Writers and what is proved by them we are to believe without regard to its Determination  So that 'tis not of great Weight what this or any other such warm Councils determin'd to those I mean who with me desire to follow the proper Authority of Christ by his Holy Apostles in sacred matters Our Author here seems to believe all the partial  Athanasian  Accounts on the side of  Athanasius  as firmly as if the whole Christian World had own'd the Truth of them Whereas one that stands so stifly for the Authority of Councils and Synods ought certainly to have some regard to the contrary Opinion of at least successive Councils in that Case After all that is here produc'd there appears little or no debating at the Council of  Nice  at all  p    c  more than what  Eusebius  oblig'd them to and which might well be all at one time So that their Creed as far as I see might be sign'd the same day they met as  Monfaucon  observes tho' I do not doubt but there was private Intrigues and subtile Management beforehand as there is I believe still in all such Assemblies to this day▪ If this Author can shew that the  was here fully debated and proved to have all the way been deliver'd down from the Apostles he will say something otherwise all the political Management and Arts previous to the final Determination will be of no consequence in this Case And I desire to know if the Council of  Nice  did so unanimously and upon such undenyable Authority establish this as the undoubted perpetual Faith of Christians How a more numerous Council that of  Jerusalem  to say nothing of those of  Tyre  and  Constantinople  could in ten years time quite lose the Notion and settle the Church upon a Foundation without it as if they never knew of any such antient Tradition or Doctrine among Christians  at all This is certainly a Question to be well weighed by those that depend so intirely on the Council of  Nice  I have fully in more places than one  p    c  declar'd how far I am an Arian Nor can any one doubt from all I have said that in my uncertain philosophick Conjectures I incline more to the Followers of  Arius  himself than of  Athanasius  but in my certain Faith I keep strictly to the original Doctrine and Expressions alone with an utter Abhorrence of all Novel and rash  Arian  as well as  Athanasian  Additions and Language in such matters as I think 'tis the plain Duty of every Christian to do I take  Eunomius  to have been a much more Learned Judicious Wise and Good Man than  Arius  and so I may well speak with great Respect of the one while I have no great Esteem for the other altho' Custom may call  Eunomius  a most compleat Arian in a general Acceptation as distinguish'd from other Parties then contending in the Church And the Apologetick of this  Eunomius  which I am going to publish  certainly shew what a great Man he was I have read nothing of the Orthodox in this Century for Piety Judgment and close Adherence to the antient Faith and Language of Christians to be compar'd to it  p    c  To prove that the  Athanasians  did not own that  Solomon Prov  said that God  Created  our Saviour while they forbad that Expression under the Penalty of Heresy this Author says that is not the meaning of the Hebrew Word in this place If this be Logick I own I have none For my Argument depended not on the real Sense of the Hebrew but on the confessed Language and Sense of the Greek which the Church us'd and I think none call'd in question till after the  Council of  Nice  So that all that is here said is intirely remote from the point For the Antient Testimonies they are soon to be laid before the Reader and he is himself to judge whether they are only some  unguarded Expressions  or whether they do not contain the direct and plain  Doctrine of the two first Centuries of Christianity  I believe our Author will find it hard to set them in a  clear irresistible Light  on the side of Orthodoxy as he here speaks As to the Constitutions  p    c  with their Interpolations and Doxologies I refer this Author to my Essay upon them which is now to be Publish'd and am not afraid still to assert notwithstanding all this Authors Exclamations that they are  the most Sacred of the Canonical Books of the New Testament    p    c  To prove that my Lord of  Worcester  is Angry with me for transposing some Parts of the former Thirteen Chapters of St  Matthew  he alledges that his Lordship differs from me about the Day of Christs Death and some Circumstances belonging to his Passion in the Twenty Sixth and Twenty Seventh Chapters If our Reflecter goes on in this way of reasoning he will soon become Unanswerable  p    I believe Monsieur  Toinards  is an excellent Harmony by what small sight I have had of it but sure I may venture to differ from him or omit his large Book in a small Catalogue without any great Imputation of Ignorance especially while there were so few Copies of it in  England  when I wrote that Catalogue  p    As to the Eighty Fifth Canon I did certainly discover its being Apostolical long before I found the rest to be so Let this Author say what he pleases And as to Dr  Grabes  proper denyal of any thing I have related of him I can hardly find it  p    For as to the general Charge of Misrepresentation  so common in all such Cases he rather intimates he will make it good hereafter than has yet done it So that all our Authors Flourishes here are upon very little Foundation  p    c  Nor does he seem to differ much from me at last about the meaning of the Scripture Phrases usually interpreted of a proper Eternity notwithstanding his shew of still confuting and reproaching me thereupon And for the Citations from  Ignatius    p    sure the Quotations in those Fathers he means are of  later Writers  or  Writers  much  later  than  Ignatius  and in no other Sense did I use those Words For I did not then nor do yet remember of what particular Antiquity the Citations he refers to were suppos'd to be The  Preface  to the Arabick Doctrine is that which I alone Publish'd and mainly depended on  p    as I still do and till its Authority be disprov'd which I believe cannot be done it certainly goes a great way to  put an End to the Dispute  about the Constitutions  for ever  This Author is to prove Mr  Emlin  once a  Socinian  even notwithstanding several Passages in his Writings intirely disagree thereto  p    c  Now sure this Author might have suppos'd that I knew an Intimate Friends Opinions both former and later better than a meer Stranger could do And that I would not notoriously falsify in such a plain case And I still assure him I spake the direct Truth And that he may learn to examin better before he  Writes  any more about Mr  Emlin  's Opinions I shall tell him what I know of them both from his Writings and from his own Month  viz  that when formerly he examin'd that matter he found that our Saviour Preexisted and mos  probably made the World as the Fathers In+strument And so he was not a  Socinian  Nay h  inclin'd most to the  Arians  But observing how he was call'd a  Man  and not knowing what powers even Human Nature in a Preexisting State might be capable of deriving from God when he pleas'd to inhabit in it or intimately unite himself in it he car'd not to enter deep into the Dispute between the Socinians and Arians but asserted what he was more fully satisfied in that Christ was not the same Being with or equal to the supreme God and that the subordinate Worship requir'd to be paid him did not imply any such Things That these were his real Thoughts  Humble Enquiry p    his own Words in the Pages here cited do shew which are these  So that it should seem that Nature which did preexist did not possess the supreme WillTho' he be allow'd to be a Man approved of God by Signs and mighty Wonders  p    which God did by him and by whom God made the World as the Instrument  This is also more plain by his intire little Treatise in Vindication of the Bishop of  Gloucesters  Preexistence of the Soul of Christ also But how a Passage from Bishop  Williams  who seems to have known no more than our Author what Mr  Emlins  Opinions were is a proof that he was a Socinian I by no means understand  p    So miserably do such Writers of Controversy argue when they pretend without proper evidence to affix odious Opinions and Imputations upon their Adversaries for which this Author among the rest must give an Account another day notwithstanding his strange way of Writing here so little agreeing with Truth or with Christianity Nor does he reason better when from the Verdict of a Jury of Tradesmen He concludes the same Mr  Emlin  really guilty of  Blasphemy  and accordingly treats him as well as my self as  Blasphemers    p    Yet 'tis to me prodigiously  strange that the  Subordination  of Christ to the Father should be exact Orthodoxy while his  Inferiority  borders on no less a Crime than  Blasphemy  I hope it will in a little time be hard to make Mankind believe any such extravagant Assertions let them be deliver'd with never so great an Air of Magisterial Authority Nor will this Authors Repetition of the Athanasian Reading of  Act    purchas'd by the Blood of God    p    have I hope any other effect on the honest and impartial than to make them look into Dr  Mills  's various Readings and at once to see and abhor such Heretical Forgeries and Interpolations in the very Books of the New Testament The Quotation of which interpolated Text is the more strange here since by his Silence he seems to desert the other more certain and gross Orthodox Interpolation  p      Joh  v Of which he had made so great a noise in his former Reflections This is all that I think necessary to say at present to this Author because my four Volumes are ready to be publish'd which will supersede I hope all occasions for such Pamphlets hereafter and put Men upon deeper and more serious Enquiries However so far I venture to Animadvert on my once more kind and candid Friends Vindication without the least ill will to him or any body living Heartily Praying that he and all who are so deeply engag'd in supporting the Athanasian Heresy may quickly  come to Repentance    Tim    and the Acknowledgment of the Truth  as it is in Christ Jesus  W Whiston  Novemb
