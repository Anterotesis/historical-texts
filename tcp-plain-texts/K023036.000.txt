the JOURNALISTS c  INDEX of PERSONS celebrated in this Poem  INDEX of THINGS including Authors to be found in the Notes  APPENDIX  ADVERTISEMENT  IT will be sufficient to say of this Edition that the reader has here a much more correct and compleat copy of the  DUNCIAD  than has hitherto appear'd I cannot answer but some mistakes may have slipt into it but a vast number of others will be prevented by the Names being now not only set at length but justified by the authorities and reasons given I make no doubt the Author's own motive to use real rather than feign'd names was his care to preserve the Innocent from any false Applications whereas in the former editions which had no more than the Initial letters he was made by Keys printed here to hurt the inoffensive and what was worse to abuse his friends by an impression at  Dublin  The Commentary which attends this Poem was sent me from several hands and consequently must be unequally written yet will have one advantage over most Commentaries that it is not made upon Conjectures or at a remote distance of Time and the reader cannot but derive one pleasure from the very  Obscurity  of the persons it treats of that it partakes of the nature of a  Secret  which most people love to  be let into tho' the Men or the Things be ever so inconsiderable or trivial  Of the  Persons  it was judg'd proper to give some account for since it is only in this Monument that they must expect to survive and here survive they will as long as the  English  tongue shall remain such as it was in the reigns of Queen  ANNE  and King  GEORGE  it seem'd but humanity to bestow a word or two upon each just to tell what he was what he writ when he liv'd and when he dy'd  If a word or two more are added upon the chief Offenders 'tis only as a paper pinn'd upon the breast to mark the Enormities for which they suffer'd lest the Correction only should be remember'd and the Crime forgotten  In some Articles it was thought sufficient barely to transcribe from  Jacob Curl  and other writers of their own rank who were much better acquainted with them than any of the Authors of this Comment can pretend to be Most of them had drawn each other's Characters on certain occasions but the few here inserted are all that could be saved from the general destruction of such works  Of the part of  Scriblerus  I need say nothing his Manner is well enough known and approv'd by all but those who are too much concern'd to be Judges  The  Imitations  of the  Ancients  are added to gratify those who either never read or may have forgotten them together with some of the  Parodies  and Allusions to the most excellent of the  Moderns  If from the frequency of the former any man think the Poem too much a  Cento  our Poet will but appear to have done the same thing in jest which  Boileau  did in earnest and upon which  Vida Fracastorius  and many of the most eminent  Latin  Poets professedly valued themselves  A LETTER TO THE PUBLISHER Occasioned by the first correct EDITION of the DUNCIAD  IT is with pleasure I hear that you have procured a correct Copy of the DUNCIAD which the many surreptitious ones have rendered so necessary and it is yet with more that I am informed it will be attended with a COMMENTARY a Work so requisite that I cannot think the Author himself would have omitted it had he approv'd of the first Appearance of this Poem  Such  Notes  as have occurr'd to me I herewith send you You will oblige me by inserting them amongst those which are or will be transmitted to you by others since not only the Author's friends but even strangers appear engag'd by humanity to some care of an orphan of so much genius and spirit which its parent seems to have abandoned from the very beginning and suffered to step into the world naked unguarded and unattended  It was upon reading some of the abusive papers lately publish'd that my great regard to a person whose friendship I esteem as one of the chief honours of my life and a much greater respect to Truth than to him or any man living engag'd me in Enquiries of which the inclos'd Notes are the fruit  I perceived that most of these authors had been doubtless very wisely the first Aggressors They had try'd till they were weary what was to be got by railing at each other no body was either concern'd or surpriz'd if this or that scribler was prov'd a dunce but every one was curious to read what could be said to prove Mr POPE one and was ready to pay something for such a discovery A stratagem which would they fairly own might not only reconcile them to me but screen  them from the resentment of their lawful Superiors whom they daily abuse only as I charitably hope to get that  by  them which they cannot get  from  them  I found this was not all Ill success in that had transported them to Personal abuse either of himself or what I think he could less forgive of his friends They had call'd men of virtue and honour Bad men long before he had either leisure or inclination to call them Bad Writers and some had been such old offenders that he had quite forgotten their persons as well as their slanders till they were pleas'd to revive them  Now what had Mr POPE done before to incense them He had publish'd those works which are in the hands of every body in which not the least mention is made of any of them And what has he done since He has laugh'd and written the DUNCIAD What has that said of them A very serious truth which the publick had said before that they were dull And what it had no sooner said but they themselves were at great pains to procure or even purchase room in the prints to testify under their hands to the truth of it  I should still have been silent if either I had seen any inclination in my friend to be serious  with such accusers or if they had only meddled with his writings since whoever publishes puts himself on his trial by his Country But when his moral character was attack'd and in a manner from which neither Truth nor Virtue can secure the most innocent in a manner which though it annihilates the credit of the accusation with the just and impartial yet aggravates very much the guilt of the accuser I mean by Authors  without names  then I thought since the danger was common to all the concern ought to be so and that it was an act of justice to detect the Authors not only on this account but as many of them are the same who for several years past have made free with the greatest of names in Church and State expos'd to the world the private misfortunes of Families abus'd all even to Women and whose prostituted papers for one or other Party in the unhappy divisions of their Country have insulted the Fallen the Friendless the Exil'd and the Dead  Besides this which I take to be a publick concern I have already confess'd I had a private one I am one of that number who have long lov'd and esteem'd Mr POPE and had often declared it was not his capacity or writings which we ever thought the least valuable part of his character but the honost open and beneficent man that we most  esteem'd and lov'd in him Now if what these people say were believ'd I must appear to all my friends either a fool or a knave either impos'd on my self or imposing on them so that I am as much interested in the confutation of these calumnies as he is himself  I am no Author and consequently not to be suspected either of jealousy or resentment against any of the men of whom scarce one is known to me by sight and as for their writings I have sought them on this one occasion in vain in the closets and libraries of all my acquaintance I had still been in the dark if a Gentleman had not procur'd me I suppose from some of themselves for they are generally much more dangerous friends than enemies the passages I send you I solemnly protest I have added nothing to the malice or absurdity of them which it behoves me to declare since the vouchers themselves will be so soon and so irrecoverably lost You may in some measure prevent it by preserving at least their  Which we have done in a List in the  Appendix  Titles and discovering as far as you can depend on the truth of your information the names of the conceal'd authors  The first objection I have heard made to the Poem is that the persons are too  obscure  for satire The persons themselves rather than allow the objection would forgive the satire and if one could be tempted to afford it a serious answer were not all assassinates popular insurrections the insolence of the rabble without doors and of domesticks within most wrongfully chastised if the Meanness of offenders indemnified them from punishment On the contrary Obscurity renders them more dangerous as less thought of Law can pronouce judgment only on open facts Morality alone can pass censure on intentions of mischief so that for secret calumny or the arrow flying in the dark there is no publick punishment left but what a good Writer inflicts  The next objection is that these sort of authors are  Poor  That might be pleaded as an excuse at the Old Baily for lesser crimes than Defamation for 'tis the case of almost all who are try'd there but sure it can be none for who will pretend that the robbing another of his reputation supplies the want of it in himself I question not but such authors are poor and heartily wish the objection were removed by any honest livelihood But Poverty is here the accident not the subject he who describes malice and villany to be  pale and meagre expresses not the least anger against Paleness or leanness but against malice and villany The Apothecary in  Romeo  and  Juliet  is poor but is he therefore justified in vending poison Not but Poverty itself becomes a just subject of satire when it is the consequence of vice prodigality or neglect of one's lawful calling for then it increases the publick burden fills the streets and highways with Robbers and the garrets with Clippers Coiners and Weekly Journalists  But admitting that two or three of these offend less in their morals than in their writings must Poverty make Nonsense sacred If so the fame of bad authors would be much better than that of all the good ones in the world and not one of a hundred had ever been call'd by his right name  They mistake the whole matter It is not charity to encourage them in the way they follow but to get 'em out of it For Men are not bunglers because they are poor but they are poor because they are bunglers  Is it not pleasant enough to hear our authors crying out on the one hand as if their persons and Characters were too sacred for Satire and the publick objecting on the other that they are too mean even for Ridicule But whether bread or fame be their end it must be allow'd our author by  and in this Poem has mercifully given 'em a little of both  There are two or three who by their  rank  and  fortune  have no benefit from the former objections supposing them good and these I was sorry to see in such company But if without any provocation two or three gentlemen will fall upon one in an affair wherein his interest and reputation are equally imbark'd they cannot certainly after they have been content to print themselves his  enemies  complain of being put into the Number of them  Others I'm told pretend to have been once his  Friends  Surely they are their enemies who say so since nothing can be more odious than to treat a friend as they have done But of this I can't persuade my self when I consider the constant and eternal aversion of all bad writers to a good one  Such as claim a merit from being his  Admirers  I would gladly ask if it lays him under a personal obligation at that rate he would be the most oblig'd humble servant in the world I dare swear for these in particular he never desir'd them to be his Admirers nor promis'd in return to be theirs that had truly been a sign he was of their acquaintance but would not the malicious world have suspected such an approbation of some motive worse  than ignorance in the Author of the  Essay  on  Criticism  Be it as it will the reasons of their Admiration and of his Contempt are equally subsisting for his works and theirs are the very same that they were  One therefore of their affertions I believe may be true "That he has a contempt for their writings" And there is another which would probably be sooner allow'd by himself than by any good judge beside "That his own have found too much success with the publick" But as it cannot consist with his modesty to claim this as a justice it lies not on him but entirely on the publick to defend its own judgment  There remains what in my opinion might seem a better plea for these people than any they have made use of If Obscurity or Poverty were to exempt a man from satire much more should Folly or Dulness which are still more involuntary nay as much so as personal Deformity But even this will not help them Deformity becomes an object of Ridicule when a man sets up for being handsome and so must Dulness when he sets up for a Wit They are not ridicul'd because Ridicule in itself is or ought to be a pleasure but because it is just to undeceive and vindicate the honest and unpretending part of mankind from Imposition because particular interest ought to yield to general  and a great number who are not naturally Fools ought never to be made so in complaisance to a few who are Accordingly we find that in all ages all vain pretenders were they ever so poor or ever so dull have been constantly the topicks of the most candid Satirists from the  Codrus  of JUVENAL to the  Damon  of BOILEAU  Having mention'd BOILEAU the greatest Poet and most judicious Critic of his age and country admirable for his Talents and yet perhaps more admirable for his Judgment in the proper application of them I cannot help remarking the resemblance betwixt him and our Author in Qualities Fame and Fortune in the distinctions shewn to them by their Superiors in the general esteem of their Equals and in their extended reputation amongst Foreigners in the latter of which ours has met with the better fate as he has had for his Translators persons of the most eminent rank and abilities in their respective nations  Essay on Criticism  in  French  Verse by General  Hamilton  The same in Verse also by Monsieur  Roboton  Counsellor and Privy Secretary to King  George  I after by the  Abbe Reynel  in Verse with Notes  Paris  Rape of the Lock in  French Paris  in  Italian  Verse by the Abbe  Conti  a Noble  Venetian  and by the Marquess  Rangoni  Envoy Extraordinary from  Modena  to King  George  II Others of his works by  Salvini  of  Florence  c his Essays and Dissertations on  Homer  in  French Paris    But the resemblance  holds in nothing more than in their being equally abus'd by the ignorant Pretenders to Poetry of their times of which not the least memory will remain but in their own writings and in the notes made upon them What BOILEAU has done in almost all his poems our Author has only in this I dare answer for him he will do it in no more and on his principle of attacking few but who had slander'd him he could not have done it at all had he been confin'd from censuring obscure and worthless persons for scarce any other were his enemies However as the parity is so remarkable I hope it will continue to the last and if ever he shall give us an edition of this Poem himself I may see some of 'em treated as gently on their repentance or better merit as  Perault  and  Quinault  were at last by BOILEAU  In one point I must be allow'd to think the character of our English Poet the more amiable  He has not been a follower of Fortune or Success he has liv'd with the Great without flattery been a friend to Men in power without pensions from whom as he ask'd so he receiv'd no favour but what was done Him in his friends As his Satires were the more just for being delay'd so were his Panegyricks bestow'd only on such persons as he had familiarly known only for such virtues as he had long observ'd in them and only at such times as others cease to praise if not begin to calumniate them I mean when out of power or out of fashion  As Mr  Wycherley  at the time the Town declaim'd against his book of Poems Mr  Walsh  after his death Sir  William Trumbull  when he had resign'd the office of Secretary of State Lord  Bolingbroke  at his leaving  England  after the Queen's death Lord  Oxford  in his last decline of Life Mr Secretary  Crags  at the end of the SouthSea Year and after his death Others only in  Epitaphs  A Satire therefore on writers so notorious for the contrary practise became no man so well as himself as none it is plain was so little in their friendships or so much in that of those whom they had most abus'd namely the Greatest and Best of all Parties Let me add a further reason that tho' ingag'd in their Friendships he never espous'd their Animosities and can almost singly  challenge this honour not to have written a line of any man which thro' Guilt thro' Shame or thro' Fear thro' variety of Fortune or change of Interests he was ever unwilling to own  I shall conclude with remarking what a pleasure it must be to every reader of Humanity to see all along that our Author in his very laughter is not indulging his own illnature but only punishing that of others To his Poem those alone are capable of doing justice who to use the words of a great Writer know how hard it is with regard both to his subject and his manner VETUSTIS DARE NOVITATEM OBSOLETIS NITOREM OBSCURIS

and  allowed  in  All Ages  Out of thine own Mouth will I judge thee wicked Scribler  MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS OF THE POEM  THIS Poem as it celebrated the most grave and antient of things Chaos Night and Dulness so is it of the most grave and antient kind  Homer  saith  Aristotle  was the first who gave the  Form  and saith  Horace  who adapted the  Measure  to heroic poesy But even before this may be rationally presumed from what the antients have left written was a piece by  Homer  composed of like nature and matter with this of our Poet For of Epic sort it appeareth to have been yet of matter surely not unpleasant witness what is reported of it by the Learned Archbishop  Eustatbius  in Odyss k And accordingly  Aristotle  in his poetic chap doth further set forth that as the Iliad and Odyssey  gave example to Tragedy so did this poem to Comedy its first Idaea  From these authors also it shou'd seem that the Hero or chief personage of it was no less  obscure  and his  understanding  and  sentiments  no less quaint and strange if indeed not more so than any of the actors in our poem MARGITES was the name of this personage whom Antiquity recordeth to have been  Dunce the first  and surely from what we hear of him not unworthy to be the root of so spreading a tree and so numerous a posterity The poem therefore celebrating him was properly and absolutely a  Dunciad  which tho' now unhappily lost yet is its nature sufficiently known by the infallible tokens aforesaid And thus it doth appear that the first Dunciad was the first Epic poem written by  Homer  himself and anterior even to the Iliad or Odyssey  Now forasmuch as our Poet had translated those two famous works of  Homer  which are yet left he did conceive it in some sort his duty to imitate that also which was lost And was therefore induced to be stow on it the same Form which  Homer  's is reported to have had namely that of Epic poem with a title also framed after the antient  Greek  manner to wit that of  Dunciad  Wonderful it is that so few of the moderns have been stimulated to attempt some Dunciad Since in  the opinion of the multitude it might cost less pain and oil than an imitation of the greater Epic But possible it is also that on due reflection the maker might find it easier to paint a  Charlemagne  a  Brute  or a  Godfry  with just pomp and dignity heroic than a  Margites  a  Codrus  a  Fleckno  or a  Tibbald  We shall next declare the occasion and the cause which moved our Poet to this particular work He lived in those days when after Providence had permitted the Invention of Printing as a scourge for the sins of the learned Paper also became so cheap and printers so numerous that a deluge of Authors cover'd the land Whereby not only the peace of the honest unwriting subject was daily molested but unmerciful demands were made of his applause yea of his money by such as would neither earn the one or deserve the other At the same time the Liberty of the Press was so unlimited that it grew dangerous to refuse them either For they would forthwith publish slanders unpunish'd the authors being anonymous nay the immediate publishers thereof lay sculking under the wings of an Act of Parliament assuredly intended for better purposes  Vid  Bossu du poeme Epique  ch  Now our author living in those times did conceive it an endeavour well worthy an honest Satirist  to dissuade the dull and punish the malicious  the only way that was left  In that publicspirited view he laid the plan of this Poem as the greatest service he was capable without much hurt or being slain to render his dear country First taking things from their Original he considereth the Causes creative of such Authors namely  Dulness  and  Poverty  the one born with them the other contracted by neglect of their proper talent thro' selfconceit of great abilities This truth he wrappeth in an  Allegory  Ibid  ch  as the construction of Epic poesy requireth and feigns that one of these Goddesses had taken up her abode with the other and that they jointly inspir'd all such writers and such works  Book    Verse  c  He proceedeth to shew the  qualities  they bestow on these authors and the  effects  they produce  Ver    to    Then the  materials  or  stock  with which they furnish them  Verse  to  and above all that  selfopinion  Verse    which causeth it to seem to themselves vastly greater than it is and is the prime motive of their setting up▪ in this sad and sorry merchandize The great power of these Goddesses acting in alliance whereof as the one is the mother of Industry so is the other of plodding was to be exemplify'd in some  one great  and  remarkable  action  Bossu  ch  And none could be more so than that which our poet hath chosen the Introduction of the lowest diversions of the rabble in  Smithfield  to be the entertainment of the Court and town or in other words the Action of the Dunciad is the  Verse    Removal of the Imperial Seat of Dulness from the City to the polite world as that of the Aeneid is the Removal of the Empire of  Troy  to  Latium  But as  Homer  singing only the  Wrath  of  Achilles  yet includes in his poem the whole history of the  Trojan  war in like manner our author hath drawn into this single action the whole history of Dulness and her children To this end she is represented at the very  Verse    to    Opening of the poem taking a view of her Forces which are distinguish'd into these three kinds Partywriters dull Poets and wild Critics  A  Person  must next be fix'd upon to support this Action who to agree with the said design must be such an one as is capable of being all three This Phantom in the poet's mind must have a  Name k  He seeks for one who hath been concerned in the Politic Journals written bad Plays or Poems and publish'd  d Bossu  ch Vide  Aristot Poetic  c  low Criticisms He finds his Name to be  Tibbald  and he becomes of course the Hero of the poem  The  Fable  being thus according to best example one and entire as contain'd in the proposition the  Machinery  is a continued chain of Allegories setting forth the whole power ministry and empire of Dulness extended thro' her subordinate instruments in all her various operations  This is branched into  Episodes  each of which hath its Moral a part tho' all conducive to the main end The crowd assembled in the second book demonstrates the design to be more extensive than to bad Poets only and that we may expect other Episodes of the Patrons Encouragers or Paymasters of such authors as occasion shall bring them forth And the third book if well consider'd seemeth to embrace the whole world Each of the Games relateth to some or other vile class of writers The first concerneth the Plagiary to whom he giveth the name of  More  the second the libellous Novellist whom he styleth  Eliza  the third the flattering Dedicator the fourth the bawling Critic or noisy Poet the fifth the dark and dirty Partywriter and so of the rest assigning to each some  proper name  or other such as he could find  As for the  Characters  the publick hath already acknowledg'd how justly they are drawn The manners are so depicted and the sentiments so peculiar to those  to whom applied that surely to transfer them to any other or wiser personages would be exceeding difficult And certain it is that every person concerned being consulted apart hath readily owned the resemblance of every portrait his own excepted  The  Descriptions  are singular the  Comparisons  very quaint the  Narration  various yet of one colour▪ The purity and chastity of  Diction  is so preserved that in the places most suspicious not the  words  but only the  images  have been censured and yet are those images no other than have been sanctified by Antient and Classical Authority tho' as was the manner of those good times not so curiously wrapped up yea and commented upon by most grave Doctors and approved Critics  As it beareth the name of  Epic  it is thereby subjected to such severe indispensable rules as are laid on all Neoterics a strict imitation of the Antient insomuch that any deviation accompanied with whatever poetic beauties hath always been censured by the sound Critic How exact that Imitation hath been in this piece appeareth not only by its general structure but by particular allusions infinite many whereof have escaped both the commentator and poet himself yea divers by his exceeding diligence are so alter'd and interwoven with the rest that several have already been  and more will be by the ignorant abused as altogether and originally his own  In a word the whole poem proveth itself to be the work of our Author when his faculties were in full vigour and perfection at that exact time when years have ripened the Judgment without diminishing the Imagination which by good critics is held to be punctually at  forty  For at that season it was that  Virgil  finish'd his  Georgics  and Sir  Richard Blackmore  at the like age composing his  Arthurs  declared the same to be the very  Acme  and pitch of life for Epic poesy tho' since he hath alter'd it to  sixty  the year in which he published his  Alfred a  True it is that the talents for  Criticism  namely smartness quick censure vivacity of remark certainty of asseveration indeed all but acerbity seem rather the gifts of Youth than of riper age But it is far otherwise in  Poetry  witness the works of Mr  Rymer  and Mr  Dennis  who beginning with Criticism became afterwards such Poets as no age hath parallel'd With good reason therefore did our author chuse to write his  Essay  on that subject at twenty and reserve for his maturer years this great and wonderful work of the  Dunciad  u See his Essays  TESTIMONIES OF AUTHORS Concerning our POET and his WORKS  NOW before we present thee with our Exercitations on this most delectable Poem drawn from the many volumes of our  Adversaria  on modern Authors we shall here according to the laudable usage of Editors collect the various judgments of the Learned concerning our Poet Various indeed not only of different authors but of the same author at different seasons Nor shall we gather only the Testimonies of such eminent Wits as would of course descend to posterity and consequently be read without our collection but we shall likewise with incredible labour seek out for divers others which but for this our diligence could never at the distance of  a few months appear to the eye of the most curious Hereby thou may'st not only receive the delectation of Variety but also arrive at a more certain judgment by a grave and circumspect comparison of the Witnesses with each other or of each with himself Hence also thou wilt be enabled to draw reflections not only of a critical but a moral nature by being let into many particulars of the Person as well as Genius and of the Fortune as well as Merit of our Author In which if I relate some things of little concern peradventure to thee and some of as little even to him I entreat thee to consider how minutely all true Critics and commentators are wont to insist upon such and how material they seem to themselves if to none other Forgive me therefore gentle reader if following learned example I ever and anon become tedious allow me to take the same pain to find whether my author were good or bad well or illnatured modest or arrogant as another whether his author were fair or brown short or tall or whether he wore a coat or a cassock  We purposed to begin with his Life Parentage and Education but as to these even his Cotemporaries do exceedingly differ One saith he was educated at home  Giles Jacob  's Lives of Poets vol    in his Life  another that he was bred abroad at St  Omer  's by Jesuits  Dennis  's reflect on the Essay on Crit  a third not at  St Omer  's but at  Oxford  Dunciad dissected p    a fourth that he had no University education at all  Guardian No    Those who allow him to be bred at home differ as much concerning his Tutor One saith he was kept by his father on purpose  Jacob ib  a second that he was an itinerant priest  Dunc diss  ibid  a third that he was a Parson  Farmer  P  and his son  ibid  one calleth him a secular Clergyman of the Church of  Rome  Dunc dissect  another a Monk  Characters of the Times p    As little agree they about his Father whom one supposeth like the father of  Hesiod  a tradesman or merchant  Female Dunc p ult  another a husbandman  Dunc dissect  another a hatter c  Room  Paraphrase on the    th of  Genesis  printed    in Character of Mr  P  and his Writings  in a  Letter to a Friend  printed for  S Popping  p  Curl  in his Key  to the Dunciad  first edit said to be printed for  A Dod in the tenth page declared  Gildon  to be author of that Libel tho' in the subsequent editions of his Key he left out this assertion and affirm'd in the  Curliad p and  that it was writ by  Dennis  only  Nor has an author been wanting to give our Poet such a Father as  Apuleius  hath to  Plato Iamblicus  to  Pythagoras  and divers to  Homer  namely a  Daemon  For thus Mr  Gildon m  Certain it  is that his Original is not from  Adam  but the Devil and that he wanteth nothing but horns and tail to be the exact resemblance of his infernal father  Finding therefore such contrariety of opinions and whatever be ours of this sort of generation not being fond to enter into controversy we shall defer writing the life of our Poet till authors can determine among themselves what parents or education he had or whether he had any education or parents at all  Proceed we to what is more certain his Works tho' not less uncertain the judgments concerning them beginning with his ESSAY ON CRITICISM of which hear first the the most Ancient of Critics  Mr JOHN DENNIS  "His precepts are false or trivial or both his thoughts are crude and abortive his expressions absurd his numbers harsh and unmusical without cadence or variety his rhymes trivial and commoninstead of majesty we have something that is very mean instead of gravity something that is very boyish and instead of perspicuity and lucid order we have but too often obscurity and confusion"  And in another place  "What rare  Numbers  are here would not one swear this youngster had espoused some antiquated muse who had sued  out a divorce from some superanhuated sinner upon account of impotence and who being poxt by her former spouse has got the gout in her decrepit age which makes her  hobble so damnably  "  Roflections critical and satyrical on a Rhapsody call'd an Essay on Criticism Printed for  Bernard Lintot vo  No less peremptory is the censure of our hypercritical Historian  Mr OLDMIXON  "I dare not say any thing of the Essay on Criticism in verse but if any more curious reader has discover'd in it something  new  which is not in  Dryden  's prefaces dedications and his essay on dramatick poetry not to mention the  French  critics I should be very glad to have the benefit of the discovery"  He is follow'd as in fame so in judgment by the modest and simpleminded  Mr LEONARD WELSTED  Who out of great respect to our poet not naming him doth yet glance at his Essay together with the Duke of  Buckingham  's and the Criticisms of  Dryden  b Essay on Criticism in Prose  vo  by the author of the  Critical History of England  and of  Horace  which he more openly taxeth  Preface to his Poems p      "As to the numerous treatises essays arts c both in verse and prose that have been written by the moderns on this groundwork they do but  hackney the same thoughts over again  making them still more  trite  Most of their pieces are nothing but a pert insipid heap of  commonplace Horace  has even in his Art of poetry thrown out several things which plainly shew he thought an art of poetry was of no use even while he was writing one"  To all which great authorities we can only oppose that of  Mr ADDISON  Spectator No      "The Art of Criticism saith he which was published some months since is a masterpiece in its kind The observations follow one another like those in  Horace  's art of poetry without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prosewriter They are some of them  uncommon  but such as the reader must assent to when he sees them explain'd with that ease and perspicuity in which they are delivered As for those which are the  most known  and the most  receiv'd  they are placed in so beautiful a light and illustrated with such apt  allusions that they have in them all the graces of novelty and make the reader who was before acquainted with them still more convinc'd of their truth and solidity And here give me leave to mention what Monsieur  Boileau  has so well enlarged upon in the preface to his works That wit and fine writing doth not confist so much in advancing things that are new as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn It is impossible for us who live in the latter ages of the world to make observations in criticism morality or any art or science which have not been touch'd upon by others we have little else left us but to represent the common sense of mankind in more strong more beautiful or more uncommon lights If a reader examines  Horace  's art of poetry he will find but few precepts in it which he may not meet with in  Aristotle  and which were not commonly known by all the poets of the  Augustan  age His way of expressing and applying them not his invention of them is what we are chiefly to admire  Longinus  in his reflections has given us the same kind of Sublime which he observes in the several passages that occasioned them I cannot but take notice that our  English  Author has after the same manner exemplisy'd several of the precepts in the  very precepts themselves"  He then produces some instances of a particular beauty in the Numbers and concludes with saying that  "there are three poems in our tongue of the same nature and each a masterpiece in its kind The Essay on translated Verse The Essay on the Art of Poetry and the Essay on Criticism"  Of  Windsor  Forest positive is the judgment of the affirmative  Mr JOHN DENNIS  Letter to  B B  at the end of the remarks on  Pope  's  Homer  "That it is a wretched rhapsody impudently writ in emulation of the  Cooper's Hill  of Sir  John Denham  The Author of it is obscure is ambiguous is affected is temerarious is barbarous  Printed    p    "  But the Author of the Dispensary  Dr GARTH  In the preface to his poem of  Claremont  differs from this opinion  "Those who have seen those two excellent poems of  Cooper's Hill  and  Windsor Forest  the one written by Sir  John Denham  the other by Mr  Pope  will shew a great deal of candour if they approve of this"  Of his Epistle of  Eloisa  we are told by the obscure writer of a poem called Sawney  "That because Prior's Henry and Emma charm'd the finest tastes our author writ his Eloise  in opposition to it  but forgot innocence and virtue If you take away her tender thoughts and her fierce desires all the rest is of no value"  In which methinks his judgment resembleth that of a  French  taylor on a Villa and gardens by the Thames  "All this is very fine but take away the River and it is good for nothing"  But very contrary hereunto was the opinion of  Mr PRIOR  himself saying in his  Alma  Alma Cant  O  Abelard  illfated youth  Thy tale will justify this truth  But well I weet thy cruel wrong  Adorns a nobler Poet's song  Dan  Pope  for thy misfortune griev'd  With kind concern and skill has weav'd  A silken web and ne'er shall fade  Its colours gently has he laid  The mantle o'er thy sad distress  And Venus shall the Texture bless c  Come we now to his Translation of the ILIAD celebrated by numerous pens yet shall it suffice to mention the indefatigable  Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE Kt  Who tho' otherwise a severe censurer of our author yet stileth this a "laudable translation  In his Essays vol printed for E Curl  " That ready writer  Mr OLDMIXON  In his foremention'd Essay frequently commends the same And the painful  Mr LEWIS THEOBALD  thus extols it  Censor vol No  "The spirit of Homer breathes all through this translationI am in doubt whether I should most admire the justness to the original or the force and beauty of the language or the sounding variety of the numbers But when I find all these meet it puts me in mind of what the poet says of one of his heroes That he alone rais'd and flung with ease a weighty stone that two common men could not lift from the ground just so one single person has performed in this translation what I once despaired to have seen done by the force of several masterly hands"  Indeed  the same gentleman appears to have chang'd his sentiment in his Essay on the Art of sinking in reputation printed in Mist's Journal March where he says thus  "In order to sink in reputation let him take it into his head to descend into Homer let the world wonder as it will how the devil he got there and pretend to do him into English so his version denote his neglect of the manner how"  Strange Variation We are told in  MIST'S JOURNAL June  "That this translation of the Iliad was not in all respects conformable to the fine taste of his friend Mr Addison Insomuch that he employ'd a  younger muse  in an undertaking of this kind which he supervis'd himself"  Whether Mr Addison did find it conformable to his taste or not best appears from his own testimony the year following its publication in these words  Mr ADDISON Freeholder No  "When I consider my self as a British freeholder I am in a particular manner pleased with the labours of those who have improved our language with the translation of old Greek and Latin authorsWe have already most of their Historians in our own tongue and what is more for the honour of our language it has been taught to express  with elegance the greatest of their Poets in each nation The illiterate among our own countrymen may learn to judge from Dryden's Virgil of the most perfect Epic performance And those parts of Homer which have been publish'd already by Mr Pope give us reason to think that the Iliad will appear in English with as little disadvantage to that immortal poem"  As to the rest there is a slight mistake for this  younger Muse  was  elder  Nor was the gentleman who is a friend of our author employ'd by Mr Addison to translate it  after him  since he saith himself that he did it  before  Vid Pref to Mr Tickel's Translation of the first book of the Iliad to  Contrariwise that Mr Addison ingaged our author in this work appeareth by declaration thereof in the preface to the Iliad printed some years before his death and by his own letters of Oct and Nov where he declares it is his opinion that no other person was equal to it  Next comes his Shakespear on the stage Let him quoth one whom I take to be  Mr THEOBALD Mist's Journal March  "publish such an author as he has least studied and  forget to discharge even the dull duty of an editor In this project let him lend the bookseller his name for a competent sum of money tho' to promote the credit of an exorbitant subscription"  Gentle reader be pleas'd to cast thine eye on the  Proposal  below quoted and on what follows some months after the former assertion in the same Journalist of June  "The bookseller propos'd the book by subscription and rais'd some thousands of pounds for the same"  I believe the gentleman did  not share in the profits of this extravagant Subscription  After the Iliad he undertook saith  MIST'S JOURNAL June  "the sequel of that work the Odyssey and having secured the success by a numerous subscription he employ'd some  Underlings  to perform what according to his proposals should come from his own hands"  To which heavy charge we can in truth oppose nothing but the words of  Mr POPE'S PROPOSAL for the ODYSSEY  printed by J Watts Jan  "I take this occasion to declare that the subscription for Shakespear belongs wholly to Mr Tonson And that the benefit of  This Proposal  is not solely for my own use but for that of  two of my friends  who have  assisted me in this work  "  But these very gentlemen are extolled above our poet himself in  another of Mist's Journals March saying  "That he would not advise Mr Pope to try the experiment again of getting a great part of a book done by assistants lest those extraneous parts should unhappily ascend to the sublime and retard the declension of the whole"  Behold these  Underlings  are become good writers  If any say that before the said proposals were printed the subscription was begun without declaration of such assistance verily those who set it on foot or as their term is secur'd it to wit the right honourable the Lord Vifcount HARCOURT were he living would testify and the right honourable the Lord BATHURST now living doth testify the same is a falshood  Sorry I am that persons professing to be learned or of whatever rank of authors should either falsly tax or be falsly taxed Yet let us who are only reporters be impartial in our citations and proceed  MIST'S JOURNAL June  "Mr Addison rais'd this author from obscurity obtain'd him the acquaintance and friendship of the  whole body of our Nobility  and transfer'd his powerful interests with those great men to this rising bard who frequently levied by that means unusual contributions on the publick"  Which  surely cannot be if as the author of Dunciad diffected reporteth  "Mr  Wycherley  had before introduced him into a familiar acquaintance with the  greatest Peers  and  brightest Wits  then living"  "No sooner saith the same Journalist was his body lifeless but this author reviving his resentment libelled the memory of his departed friend and what was still more heinous made the scandal publick"  Grievous the accusation unknown the accuser the person accused no witness in his own cause the person in whose regard accus'd dead But if there be living any one nobleman whose friendship yea any one gentleman whose subssription Mr  Addison  procur'd to our author let him stand forth that truth may appear  Amicus Plato amicus Socrates sed magis amica veritas  In verity the whole story of the libel is a lye witness those persons of integrity who several years before Mr Addison's decease did see and approve of the said verses in no wise a libel but a friendly rebuke sent privately in our author's own hand to Mr  Addison  himself and never made publick till after their own Journals and Curl had printed the same One name alone which I am authorized here to declare will sufciently evince this truth that of the right honourable the Earl of BURLINGTON  Next is he taxed with a crime with some authors I doubt more heinous than any in morality to wit Plagiarism from the inventive and quaintconceited  JAMES MOORE SMITH Gent  Daily Journal March  ""Upon reading the third volume of Pope's Miscellanies I found five lines which I thought excellent and happening to praise them a gentleman produced a modern comedy the Rival Modes published last year where were the same verses to a tittle These gentlemen are undoubtedly the first plagiaries that pretend to make a reputation by stealing from a man's works in his own life time and out of a publick print"  Let us join to this what is written by the author of the Rival Modes the said Mr James Moore Smith in a letter to our author himself who had inform'd him a month before that play was acted Jan that  "these verses which he had before given him leave to insert in it would be known for his some copies being got abroad"  "He desires nevertheless that since the lines had been read in his Comedy to several Mr P would not deprive it of them c"  Surely if we add the testimonies of the Lord BOLINGBROKE of the  Lady to whom the said verses were originally address'd of  Hugh Bethel  Esq  and others who knew them as our author's long before the said gentleman composed his play it is hoped the ingenuous that affect not error will rectify their opinion by the suffrage of so honourable personages  And yet followeth another charge insinuating no less than his Enmity both to Church and State which could come from no other Informer than the said  Mr JAMES MOORE SMITH  Daily Journal April    "The  Memoirs of a Parish clark  was a very dull and unjust abuse of a person who wrote in defence of our Religion and Constitution and who has been dead many years"  This also seemeth most untrue it being known to divers that these memoirs were written at the seat of the Lord  Harcourt  in Oxfordshire before that excellent person Bishop  Burnet  's death and many years before the appearance of that History of which they are pretended to be an abuse Most true it is that Mr Moore had such a design and was himself the man who prest Dr Arbuthnot and Mr Pope to assist him therein and that he borrow'd those Memoirs of our author when that History came forth with intent to  turn them to such abuse But being able to obtain from our author but one single Hint and either changing his mind or having more mind than ability he contented himself to keep the said Memoirs and read them as his own to all his acquaintance A noble person there is into whose company Mr Pope once chanced to introduce him who well remembreth the conversation of Mr Moore to have turned upon the  "contempt he had for the work of that reverend prelate and how full he was of a design he declared himself to have of exposing it"  This noble person is the EARL of PETERBOROUGH  Here in truth should we crave pardon of all the foresaid right honourable and worthy personages for having mention'd them in the same page with such weekly riffraff railers and rhymers but that we had their everhonour'd commands for the same and that they are introduc'd not as witnesses in the controversy but as witnesses that cannot be controverted not to dispute but to decide  Certain it is that dividing our writers into two classes of such who were acquaintance and of such who were strangers to our author the former are those who speak well and the other those who speak evil of him Of the first class the most noble  JOHN Duke of BUCKINGHAM  sums up his character in these lines  Verses to Mr  P  on his translation of  Homer  And yet so wond'rous

desert in sciences exceed  So also is he decypher'd by the honourable  SIMON HARCOURT  Poem prefix'd to his works  Say wond'rous youth what column wilt thou chuse  What laurel'd arch for thy

learned Clerk of  Suffolk  Mr WILLIEM BROOME  In his poems and at the end of the Odyssey  Thus nobly rising in fair  virtue  's cause  From thy own  life  transcribe th'  unerring laws  And divers more with which we will not tire the reader  Let us rather recreate thee by turning to the other side and shewing his Character drawn by those with  whom he never convers'd and whose countenances he could not know tho' turned against him First again commencing with the highvoiced and neverenoughquoted  JOHN DENNIS  Who in his reflections on the Essay on Criticism thus describeth him  A little affected hypocrite who has nothing in his mouth but candour truth friendship good nature humanity and magnanimity He is so great a lover of falshood that whenever he has a mind to calumniate his cotemporaries he brands them with some defect which is just  contrary to some good quality  for which all their  friends and their acquaintance  commend them He seems to have a particular pique to  People of Quality  and authors of that rankHe must derive his religion from  St Omer  's  But in the character of Mr  P  and his writings printed by  S Popping  he saith  "tho' he is a Professor of the worst religion yet he  laughs at it"  but that  "nevertheless he is a  virulent Papist  and yet a  Pillar  for the  Church of England  "  Of both which opinions  Mr THEOBALD  seems also to be declaring in  Mist  's Journal of  June    "That if he is not shrewdly abus'd he made it his practice to cackle to  both parties  in  their own sentiments"  But as to his  Pique  against  people of quality  the same Journalist doth not agree but saith  May    "he had by some means or other the  acquaintance  and  friendship  of the  whole body of our Nobility  "  However contradictory this may appear Mr  Dennis  and  Gildon  in the Character last cited make it all plain by assuring us  "That he is a creature that reconciles all contradictions he is a beast and a man a Whig and a Tory a writer at one and the same time of  The names of two weekly Papers  Guardians and Examiners an assertor of liberty and of the dispensing power of kings a jesuitical professor of truth a base and a foul pretender to candour"  So that upon the whole account we must conclude him either to have been a great hypocrite or a very honest man a terrible imposer upon both parties or very moderate to either  Be it as to the judicious reader shall seem good Sure it is he is little favour'd of certain authors whose wrath is perilous For one declares he ought to have a  price set on his head  and to be hunted down as a  wild beast  Theobald  Letter in Mist's Journal  June  Another protests that he  does not know  what may happen  advises him to  insure his person  says he has  bitter enemies  and

great an  esteem  for Mr  Pope  and so high an  opinion  of his  genius  and  excellencies  That notwithstanding he professes a  veneration almost rising to Idolatry  for the writings of this

after having violently attack'd him in many pieces at last came to wish from his heart  "That Mr  Pope  would be prevail'd upon to give us  Ovid  's Epistles by his hand for it is certain we see the original of  Sapho  to  Phaon  with much more life and likeness in his version than in that of Sir  Car Scrope  And this he adds is the more to be wish'd because  in the  English  tongue we have

works  we find the most  happy turns  and  natural similies  wonderfully short and thick sown"  The Essay on the Dunciad also owns pag it is very full of  beautiful Images  Mr GILDON and DENNIS  in the most furious of all their works the forecited Character p do in  In Concert  Hear how Mr  Dennis  hath proved our mistake in this place  "As to my writing in  Concert  with Mr  Gildon  I declare upon the honour and word of a gentleman that I never wrote so much as one line in  concert  with any one man whatsoever And these two Letters from Mr  Gildon  will plainly show that we are not Writers

Sir I had not the opportunity of hearing your excellent Pamphlet 'till this Day I am infinitely satisfied and pleas'd with it and hope you will meet with that Encouragement which your admirable

like Mr  Bayes  in the Rehearsal that is like Mr  Dryden  a notable knack of rhyming and writing smooth verse"  To the  Success  of all his pieces they do unanimously give testimony But it is sufficient  instar omnium  to behold this last great Critic sorely lamenting it even from the Essay on Criticism to this Day of the Dunciad  "the treatise of the  Profund  is very dall and that Mr  Pope  is the author of it"  The writer of  Gulliveriana  is of another opinion and says  "the whole or greatest part of the merit of this treatise must and can only be ascrib'd to  Gulliver  "  Gulliv

neither genius for Tragedy or Comedy"  Which whether true or not is not easy to judge in as much as he hath attempted neither  But from all that hath been said the discerning reader will collect that it little avail'd our author to have any Candour since when he declar'd he did not write for others it was not credited As little to have any Modesty since when he declin'd writing in any way himself the presumption of others was imputed to him If he  singly  enterpriz'd one great work he was tax'd of Boldness and Madness to a prodigy  i  if he  took  assistants  in another it was complain'd of

most rare and singular Character of which let the reader make what he can  Doubtless most Commentators would hence take occasion to turn all to their Author's advantage and from the testimony of his very enemies would affirm That his Capacity was boundless as well as his Imagination that he was a perfect master of all Styles and  all Arguments And that there was in those times no other Writer in any kind of any degree of excellence save he himself But as this is not our own sentiment we shall determine on nothing but leave thee gentle reader to steer thy judgment equally between various

Shakespeare  constantly observes the preservation of this very letter  e  in spelling the name of his beloved Author and not like his common careless Editors with the omission of one nay sometimes of two  ee  's as  Shak'spear  which is utterly unpardonable Nor is the neglect of a  Single Letter  so trivial as to some it may appear the alteration whereof in a learned language is an  Atchievement that brings honour  to the Critic who advances it and Dr B will be remembered to posterity for his performances of  this sort  as long as the world shall have any esteem for the Remains of  Menander  and  Philemon  THEOBALD  I have a just value for the letter E and the same affection for the name of this poem as the forecited Critic for that of his author yet cannot it induce me to agree with those who would add yet another  e  to it and call it the  Dunceiade  which being a French  and foreign termination is no way proper to a word entirely English and vernacular One  e  therefore in this case is right and two  e  's wrong Yet upon the whole I shall follow the Manuscript and print it without any  e  at all mov'd thereto by Authority at all times with Critics equal if not superior to

publisher of many noted pamphlets in the time of King  Charles  the second He answer'd all  Dryden  's political poems and being cried up on one side succeeded not a little in his Tragedy of the Empress of Morocco the first that was ever printed with cuts  "Upon this he grew insolent the Wits writ against his Play he replied and the Town judged he had the better In short  Settle  was then

together and are of that sort of nonsense which so perfectly confounds all Idea's that there is no distinct one left in the mind Further he says of him that he hath prophecy'd his own poetry shall be sweeter than  Catullus Ovid  and  Tibullus  but we have little hope of the accomplishment of it from what he hath lately publish'd"  Upon which Mr  Oldmixon  has not spar'd a reflection  "That the putting the Laurel on the head of one who writ such verses will give futurity a very lively idea of the Judgment and justice of those who bestow'd it"  Ibid p  But the wellknown learning of that Noble Person who was then Lord Chamberlain might have screen'd him from this unmannerly reflection Mr  Eusden  was made  Laureate  for the same reason that  Mr  Tibbald  was made  Hero  of This Poem because there was no better to be had Nor ought Mr  Oldmixon  to complain so long after that the Laurel would better have become his own brows or any other's It were more decent to acquiesce in the opinion of

pity than of that which he daily provokes laughter and contempt Did we really know how much this  poor man I wish that reflection on  poverty  had been spared  suffers by being contradicted or which is the same thing in effect by hearing another praised we should in compassion sometimes attend to him with a silent nod and let him go away with the triumphs of his ill nature  Poor  Furius  again  when any of his cotemporaries are spoken well of quitting the ground of the present dispute steps back a thousand years to call in the succour of the Ancients His very  panegyrick  is  spiteful  and he uses it for the same reason as some Ladies do their commendations of a dead beauty who never would have had their good word but that a living one happened to be mentiond in their company His applause is not the tribute of his  Heart  but the sacrifice of his  Revenge  "  c Indeed his pieces against our Poet are somewhat of an angry character and as they are now scarce extant a  taste of his stile may be satisfactory to the curious  "A young squab short gentleman whose outward form though it should be that of downright monkey would not differ so much from human shape as his unthinking immaterial part does from human understandingHe is as stupid and as venomous as a hunchbacked toadA book through which folly and ignorance those brethren so lame and impotent do ridiculously look very big and very dull and strut and hobble cheek by jowl with their arms on kimbo being led and supported and bullybacked by that blind Hector Impudence"  Reflect on the  Essay  on  Crit  pag    It would be unjust not to add his reasons for this Fury they are so strong and so coercive  "I regard him saith he as an  ▪Enemy  not so much to me as to my King to my Country to my Religion and to that

my duty I say to do  you shall see what  to pull the lion's skin from this little Ass which popular error has thrown round him and to shew that this Author who has been lately so much in vogue has neither  sense in his thoughts  nor  english in his expressions  "  DENNIS Rem on  Hom  Pref  p  and  p  c  Besides these publickspirited reasons Mr  D  had a private one which by his manner of expressing it in page appears to have been equally strong He was even in bodily fear of his life from the machinations of the said Mr  P  "The story says he is too long to be told but who would be acquainted with it may hear it from Mr  Curl  my BooksellerHowever what my reason has suggested to me that I have with a just  confidence  said in defiance of his two clandestine weapons his  Slander  and his  Poyson  "  Which last words of his book plainly discover  Mr D  his suspicion was that of being  poysoned  in like manner as Mr  Curl  had been before him Of which fact see  A full and true account of a horrid and barbarous revenge by poyson on the body of  Edmund Curl printed in the year antecedent to that wherein these Remarks of Mr  Dennis  were published But what puts it beyond all question is a passage in a very warm treatise in which Mr  D  was also concerned price twopence called  A true character of Mr  Pope  and his writings printed for S Popping  in the tenth page whereof he is said  "to have insulted people on those calamities and diseases which he himself gave them by administring  Poyson  to them"  and is called  p    "a lurking waylaying coward and a stabber in the dark"  Which with many other things most lively set forth in that piece must have render'd him a terror not to Mr  Dennis  only but to all christian people  For the rest Mr  John Dennis  was the son of a Sadler in  London  born in He paid court to Mr  Dryden  and having obtained some correspondence with Mr  Wycherly  and Mr  Congreve  he immediately obliged the publick with their Letters He made himself known to the Government by many admirable schemes and projects which the Ministry for reasons best known to themselves constantly kept private For his character as a writer it is given us as follows  "Mr  Dennis  is  excellent  at pindarick writings  perfectly regular  in all his performances and a person of  sound Learning  That he is master of a great deal of  Penetration  and  Judgment  his criticisms particularly on Prince  Arthur  do sufficiently demonstrate"  From the same account it also appears that he writ Plays  "more to get  Reputation  than  Money  "  DENNIS  of himself  See  Giles Jacob  's Lives of Dram Poets  gage    compared with page    V  But chief in  Tibbald  Lewis Tibbald  as pronounced or  Theobald  as written was bred an Attorney and son to an Attorney says Mr  Jacob  of  Sittenburn  in  Kent  He was Author of many forgotten Plays Poems and other pieces and of several anonymous Letters in praise of them in  Mist  's Journal He was concern'd in a Paper call'd the  Censor  and a translation of  Ovid  as we find from DENNIS'S remarks on  Pope  's  Homer p    "There is a notorious Idiot one hight  Whachum  who from an underspurleather to the Law is become an understrapper to the Play house who has lately burlesqu'd the Metamorphoses of  Ovid  by a vile translation c This fellow is concern'd in an impertinent Paper called the  Censor  "  But notwithstanding this severe character another Critic says of him  "That he has given us some pieces which met with approbation and that  the Cave of Poverty  is an excellent Poem"  JACOB  Lives of the Poets  vol p He had  once a mind to translate the  Odyssey  the first book whereof was printed in by  B Lintot  and probably may yet be seen at his shop What is still in memory is a piece printed in to it had the title of  Shakespear Restored  Of this he was so proud himself as to say in one of  Mist  's  Journals June  "That to expose any errors in it was impracticable" And in another  April    "That whatever care might for the future be taken either by Mr  P  or any other assistants he would still give above emendations that  shall  escape them all"  During two whole years while Mr  Pope  was preparing his edition he publish'd Advertisements requesting assistance and promising satisfaction to any who could contribute to its greater perfection But this Restorer who was at that time solliciting favours of him by letters did wholly conceal that he had any such design till after its publication which he was since not asham'd to own in a  Daily Journal  of  Nov  And then an outcry was made in the Prints  that our Author had joined with the Bookseller to raise an  extravagant subscription  in which he had no share of which he had no knowledge and against which he had publickly advertised in his own Proposals for  Homer  Probably that proceeding elevated  Tibbald  to the dignity he holds in this Poem which he seems to deserve no other way better than his brethren unless we impute it to the share he had in the Journals cited among the  Testimonies of Authors  prefix'd to this work  V    monsterbreeding breast  This alludes to the extravagancy of the Farces of that author

is amazing how the sense of this has been mistaken by all the former Commentators who most idly suppose it to imply that the Hero of the Poem wanted a supper In truth a great absurdity Not that we are ignorant that the Hero of  Homer  's  Odyssey  is frequently in that circumstance and therefore it can no way derogate from the grandeur of Epic Poem to represent such Hero under a calamity to which the greatest not only of Critics and Poets but of Kings and Warriors have been subject But much more refin'd I will venture to say is the meaning of our author It was to give us obliquely a curious precept or what  Bossu  calls a  disguised sentence  that "Temperance is the life of Study" The language of Poesy brings all into action and to represent a Critic encompass'd with books but without a supper is a picture which lively expresseth how much the true Critic prefers the diet of the mind to that of the body one of which he always castigates and often totally neglects for the greater improvement of the other  SCRIBLERUS  V  Volumes whose size  c This library is divided into two parts the one his polite learning consists of those books which seem to be the models of his poetry and

and patient a reader he must have been What can be more kind and affectionate than these words in the preface to his Poems to where he labours to call up all our humanity and forgiveness toward these unlucky men by the most moderate representation of their case that has ever been given by any author  "Much may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets What we call a  Genius  is hard to be distinguish'd by a man  himself from a prevalent inclination And if it be never so great he can at first discover it no other way than by that strong propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken He has no other method but to make the experiment by writing▪ and so appealing to the judgment of others And if he happens to write ill which is certainly no sin in itself he is immediately

Haunt of the Muses made their safe retreat  REMARKS on BOOK the SECOND  Two things there are upon the supposition of which the very basis of all Verbal criticism is founded  and supported The first that an author could never fail to use the  best word  on every occasion The second that a Critic cannot chuse but know  which that is  This being granted whenever any word doth not fully content us we take upon us to conclude first that the author could  never have us'd it  and secondly that he must have used  that very one  which we conjecture in its stead  We cannot therefore enough admire the learned  Scriblerus  for his alteration of the text in the two last verses of the preceding book which in all the former editions stood thus  Hoarse thunder to the bottom shook the bog  And the loud nation croak'd  God save King  Log  He has with great judgment tranposed these two epithets putting  hoarse  to the nation and  loud  to the thunder and this being evidently the true reading he vouchsafed not so much as to mention the former for which assertion of the just right of a Critic he merits the acknowledgment of all sound commentators  V  Henley  's gilt Tub  The pulpit of a dissenter is usually called a tub but that of Mr Orator  Henley  was covered with velvet and adorned with gold He had also a fair altar and over it this extraordinary inscription  The Primitive Eucharist  See the history of this person book verse  V  Or  Fleckno  's Irish Throne  Richard Fleckno  was an Irish priest but had laid aside as himself expressed it the mechanic part of priesthood He printed some plays poems letters and travels I doubt not our author took occasion to mention him in respect to the poem of Mr  Dryden  to which this bears some resemblance tho' of a character more different from it than that of the  Aeneid  from the  Iliad  or the  Lutrin  of  Boileau  from the  Defaits des Bouts rimeès  of  Sarazin  V  Or that where on her  Curls  the public pours  Edm Curl  stood in the pillory at  CharingCross  in  March    Mr  Curl  loudly complain'd of this note as an untruth protesting  "that he stood in the pillory not in  March  but in  February  "  And of another on verse  "Saying he was not tost in a  blanket  but a  rug  "  Curliad  in  p  and  V  Rome  in her capitol saw  Querno  sit  Camillo Querno  was of  Apulia  who hearing the great encouragement which  Leo  the tenth gave to poets travell'd  to  Rome  with a harp in his hand and sung to it twenty thousand verses of a poem call'd  Alexias  He was introduc'd as a buffoon to  Leo  and promoted to the honour of the laurel a jest which the court of  Rome  and the Pope himself enter'd into so far as to cause him to ride on an elephant to the Capitol and to hold a solemn festival on his coronation at which it is recorded the poet himself was so transported as to weep for joy He was ever after a constant frequenter of the Pope's table drank abundantly and poured forth verses without number PAULUS JOVIUS  Elog Virg doct ch  Some idea of his poetry is given by  Fam Strada  in his Prolusions  V  Never was dash'd out at one lucky hit  Our author here seems willing to give some account of the possibility of  Dulness  making a  wit  which could be done no other way than by  chance  The fiction is the more reconcil'd to probability by the known story of  Apelles  who being at a loss to express the foam of  Alexander  's horse dash'd his pencil in despair at the picture and happen'd to do it by that fortunate stroke  V  And call'd the phantom  More  CURL in his key to the  Dunciad  affirm'd this to be  James More Smith  Esq  and it is probable considering what is said of him in the Testimonies that some might fancy our author obliged to represent this gentleman as a plagiary or to pass for one himself His case indeed was like that of a man I have heard of who as he was sitting in company perceived his next neighbour had stolen his handkerchief  "Sir said the thief finding himself detected "do not expose me I did it for mere want be so good but to take it privately out of my pocket again and say nothing"  The honest man did so but the other cry'd out  "See gentlemen what a thief we have among us look he is stealing my handerchief"  The plagiarisms of this person gave occasion to the following Epigram  Mre  always smiles whenever he recites  He smiles you think approving what he writes  And yet in this no Vanity is shown  A modest man may like what's not his own  His only work was a comedy call'd the  Rival Modes  the town condemn'd it in the action but he printed it in with this modest Motto  Hic caestus artemque repono  The smaller pieces which we have heard attributed to this author are An Epigram on the bridge at  Blenheim  by Dr  Evans Cosmelia  by Mr  Pit  Mr  Jones  c The  Sawpit  a simile by a  Friend  and some unown'd letters advertisements and epigrams against our author in the  Daily Journal  Notwithstanding what is here collected of the person imagin'd by  Curl  to be meant in this place we cannot be of that opinion since our poet had certainly no need of vindicating half a dozen verses to himself which every reader had done for him since the name itself is not spell'd  Moore  but  More  and lastly since the learned  Scriblerus  has so well prov'd the contrary  V  The phantom  More  It appears from hence that this is not the name of a real person but fictitious  More  from    stultus    stultitia  to represent the folly of a plagiary Thus  Erasmus Admonuit me  Mori  cognomen tibi quod tam ad  Moriae  vocabulum accedit quam es

strongly to defend thy own folly  SCRIBLERUS  V  But lofty  Lintot  We enter here upon the episode of the Booksellers persons whose names being more known and famous in the learned world than those of the Authors in this poem do therefore need less explanation The action of Mr  Lintot  here imitates that of  Dares  in  Virgil  rising just in this manner to lay hold on a  Bull  This eminent Bookseller printed the  Rival Modes  abovementioned  V  Stood dauntless  Curl c  We come now to a character of much respect that of Mr  Edmond Curl  As a plain repetition of great actions is the best praise of them we shall only say of this eminent man  that he carried the Trade many lengths beyond what it ever before had arrived at and that he was the envy and admiration of all his profession He possess'd himself of a command over all authors whatever he caus'd them to write what he pleas'd they could not call their very names their own He was not only famous among these he was taken notice of by the  State  the  Church  and the  Law  and received particular marks of distinction from each  It will be own'd that he is here introduc'd with all possible dignity he speaks like the intrepid  Diomed  he runs like the swiftfooted  Achilles  if he falls 'tis like the beloved  Nisus  and what  Homer  makes to be the chief of all praises he is  favour'd of the Gods  He says but three words and his prayer is heard a  Goddess conveys it to the seat of  Jupiter  tho' he loses the prize he gains the victory the great Mother her self comforts him she inspires him with expedients she honours him with an immortal present such as  Achilles  receives from  Thetis  and  Aeneas  from  Venus  at once instructive and prophetical After this he is unrival'd and triumphant  The tribute our author here pays him is a grateful return for several unmerited obligations Many weighty animadversions on the publick affairs and many  excellent and diverting pieces on private persons has he given to his name If ever he ow'd two verses to any other he ow'd Mr  Curl  some thousands He was every day extending his fame and inlarging his writings witness innumerable instances but it shall suffice only to mention the  CourtPoems  which he meant to publish as the work of the true writer a Lady of quality but being first threaten'd and afterwards punish'd for it by Mr  Pope  he generously transferr'd it from  her  to  him  and ever since printed it in his name The single time that ever he spoke to  C  was on that affair and to that happy incident he owes all the favours since received from him So true is the saying of Dr  Sydenham  that  "any one shall be at some time or other the better or the worse for having but  seen  or  spoken  to a good or a bad man"  V  Curl  's  Corinna  This name it seems was taken by one Mrs  T  who procur'd some private letters of Mr  Pope  's while almost a boy to Mr  Cromwell  and sold them without the consent of either of those gentlemen to  Curl  who printed them in He has discover'd her to be the publisher in his  Key  p We only take this opportunity of mentioning the manner in which those letters got abroad which the author was asham'd of as very trivial things full not only of levities but of wrong  judgments of men and books and only excusable from the youth and inexperience of the writer  V  Obscene with filth c  Tho' this incident may seem too low and base for the dignity of an Epic poem the learned very well know it to be but a copy of  Homer  and  Virgil  the very words  and  Fimus  are used by them tho' our poet in compliance to modern nicety has remarkably enrich'd and colour'd his language as well as rais'd the versication in these two Episodes Mr  Dryden  in  MackFleckno  has not scrupled to mention  the Morning Toast  at  which the fishes bite in the  Thames PissingAlley Reliques of the Bum  c but our author is more grave and as a fine writer says of  Virgil  in his  Georgics tosses about his  dung  with an air of majesty  If we consider that the exercises of his  Authors  could with justice be higher than  tickling chatt'ring braying  or  diving  it was no easy matter to invent such games as were proportion'd to the meaner degree of  Booksellers  In  Homer  and  Virgil Ajax  and  Nisus  the persons drawn in this plight are  heroes  whereas here they are such with whom it had been great impropriety to have join'd any but vile ideas besides the natural connection there is between Libellers and common nusances Nevertheless I have often heard our author own that this part of his poem was as it frequently happens what cost him most trouble and pleas'd him least but that he hoped 'twas excusable since levell'd at such as understand no delicate satire Thus the politest men are sometimes obliged to  swear  when they happen to have to do with porters and oysterwenches  V  Down with the  Bible  up with the  Pope  's  Arms  The Bible  Curl  's sign the Crosskeys  Lintot  's  V  An unpaid Taylor  This line has been loudly complain'd of in  Mist June  ▪  Dedic to Sawney  and others as a most inhuman satire on the  poverty  of  poets  but it is thought our author would be acquited by a jury of  Taylors  To me this instance seems unluckily chosen if it be a satire on any body it must be on a bad  paymaster  since the person to whom they have here apply'd it was a man of fortune Not but poets may well be jealous of so great a prerogative as  nonpayment  which Mr  Dennis  so far asserts as boldly to pronounce that  "if  Homer  himself was not in debt it was because no body would trust him"  Pref to Rem on the Rape of the Lock p    V  Like  Congrvee Addison  and  Prior  These authors being such whose names will reach posterity we shall not give any account of them but proceed to those of whom it is necessary  Besalcel Morris  was author of some satires on the translators of  Homer  with many other things printed in newspapers  "  Bond  writ a satire against Mr  P  Capt  Breval  was author of  The Confederates  an ingenious dramatic performance to expose Mr  P  Mr  Gay  Dr  Arb  and some ladies of quality"  says CURL  Key  p  V  Mears Warner Wilkins  Booksellers and Printers of much anonymous stuff  V  Breval Besaleel Bond  I foresee it will be objected from this line that we were in an error in our assertion on verse of this book that  More  was a fictitious name since these persons are equally represented by the poet as phantoms So at first sight it may seem but be not deceived reader these also are not real persons 'Tis true  Curl  declares  Breval  a  captain author of a piece call'd  The Confederates  But the same  Curl  first said it was written by  Joseph Gay  Is his second assertion to be credited any more than his first He likewise affirms  Bond  to be one who writ a satire on our poet but where is such a satire to be found where was such a writer ever heard of As for  Besaleel  it carries forgery in the very name nor is it as the others are a surname Thou may'st depend on it no such authors ever lived all phantoms  SCRIBLERUS  V  Joseph Gay  a fictitious name put by  Curl  before several pamphlets which made them pass with many for Mr  Gay  's  V  And turn this whole Illusion on the town  It was a common practice of this bookseller to publish vile pieces of obscure hands under the names of eminent authors  V  Cook  shall be  Prior  The man here specify'd was the son of a  Muggletonian  who kept a publick  house at  Braintree  in  Essex  He writ a thing call'd  The Battle of Poets  of which  Philips  and  Welsted  were the heroes and wherein our author was attack'd in his moral character in relation to his  Homer  and  Shakespear  He writ moreover a farce of  Penelope  in the preface of which also he was squinted at and some malevolent things in the  British London  and  Daily Journals  At the same time the honest gentleman wrote letters to Mr  P  in the strongest terms protesting his innocence His chief work was a translation of  Hesiod  to which  Theobald  writ notes and halfnotes as hath already been said  V ibid  And  Concanen Swift  In the first edition of this poem there were only Asterisks in this place but the names were since inserted merely to fill up the verse and give ease to the ear of the reader  V  And we too boast our  Garth  and  Addison  Nothing is more remarkable than our author's love of praising good writers He has celebrated Sir  Isaac Newton  Mr  Dryden  Mr  Congreve  Mr  Wycherley  Dr  Garth  Mr  Walsh  Duke of  Buckingham  Mr  Addison  Lord  Lansdown  in a word almost every man of his time that deserv'd it It was very difficult to have that pleasure in a poem on this subject yet he found means to insert their panegyrick and has made even dulness out of her own mouth pronounce it It must have been particularly agreeable to him to celebrate Dr  Garth  both as his constant friend  and as he was his predecessor in this kind of satire The  Dispensary  attack'd the whole body of Apothecaries a much more useful one undoubtedly than that of the bad poets if in truth this can be call'd a body of which no two members ever agreed It also did what Mr  Theobald  says is unpardonable drew in  parts  of  private character  and introduced  persons independent of his subject  Much more would  Boileau  have incurr'd his censure who left all subjects whatever on all occasions to fall upon the bad poets which it is to be fear'd would have been more immediately his concern But certainly next to commending good writers the greatest service to learning is to expose the bad who can only that one way be made of any use to it This truth is very well set forth in these lines address'd to our author  The craven Rook and pert Jackdaw  Tho' neither birds of moral kind  Yet serve if hang'd or stuff'd with straw  To show us which way blows the wind  Thus dirty knaves or chatt'ring fools  Strung up by dozens in thy lay  Teach more by half than  Dennis'  rules  And point instruction

figure of a man are no reflections upon his  Genius  An honest mind will love and esteem a  man of worth  tho' he be deform'd or poor Yet the author of the Dunciad hath libell'd a person for his  ruful length of face  "  MIST'S JOURN  June  This  Genius  and  man of worth  whom an honest mind should love is Mr  Curl  True it is he stood in the Pillory an incident which will lengthen the face of any man tho' it were ever so comely therefore is no reflection on the natural beauty of Mr  Curl  But as to reflections on any man's face or figure Mr  Dennis  saith excellently  "Natural deformity comes not by our fault 'tis often occasion'd by calamities and diseases which a man can no more help than a monster can his deformity There is no one misfortune and no one disease but what all the rest of mankind are subject toBut the deformity of  this Author  is visible present lasting unalterable and peculiar to himself 'Tis the mark of God and  Nature upon him to give us warning that we should hold no society with him as a creature not of our original nor of our species And they who have refused to take this warning which God and Nature have given them and have in spite of it by a senseless presumption ventur'd to be familiar with him have severely suffer'd c 'Tis certain his original is not from  Adam  but from the Devil"  c DENNIS  Charact of Mr  P vo  Admirably is it observ'd by Mr  Dennis  against Mr  Law  p  "That the language of  Billingsgate  can never be the language of Charity nor consequently of Christianity"  I should else be tempted to use the language of a Critic For what is more provoking to a commentator than to behold his author thus portrayed Yet I consider it really hurts not  him  whereas maliciously to call some others dull might do them prejudice with a world too apt to believe it Therefore tho' Mr  D  may call another a  little ass  or a  young toad  far be it from us to call him a  toothless lion  or an  old serpent  Indeed had I written these notes as was once my intent in the learned language I might have given him the appellations of  Balatro Calceatum caput Scurra in triviis  being phrases in good esteem and frequent usage among the best learned But in our mothertongue were I to tax any gentleman of the Dunciad surely it should be in words not to the vulgar intelligible whereby christian charity decency and good accord among authors might be preserved  SCRIBLERUS  The good  Scriblerus  here as on all occasions eminently shews his humanity But it was far otherwise with the gentlemen of the Dunciad whose scurrilities were always personal They went so far as to libel an eminent sculptor for making our author's  Busto  in marble at the request of Mr  Gibbs  the Architect which rhimes had the undeserv'd honour to be answer'd in an  Impromptu  by the Earl of  B    Well Sir suppose the  Busto  's a damn'd head  Suppose that  Pope  's an Elf  All he can say for't is he neither made  The  Busto  nor  Himself  And by another Person of Quality  Rysbrake  to make a  Pope  of stone  Must labour hard and sore  But it would cost him labour none  To make a stone of  Moor  Their scurrilities were of that nature as

disposed in their proper places of rest the Goddess transports the King to her Temple and there lays him to slumber with his head on her lap a position of marvellous virtue which causes all the visions of wild enthusiasts projectors politicians inamorato's castlebuilders chymists and poets He is immediately carry'd on the wings of Fancy to the  Elyzian  shade where on the banks of  Lethe  the souls of the dull are dipp'd by  Bavius  before their entrance into this world There he is met by the ghost of  Settle  and by him made acquainted with the wonders of the place and with those which he is himself destin'd to perform He takes him to a  Mount of Vision  from whence he shews him the past triumphs of the Empire of Dulness then the present and lastly the future  How small a part of the world was ever conquered by  Science  how soon those conquests were stop'd and those very nations again reduced to her dominion Then distinguishing the Island of  Great Britain  shews by what aids and by what persons it shall be forthwith brought to her empire These he causes to pass in review before his eyes describing each by his proper figure character and qualifications On a sudden the Scene shifts and a vast number of Miracles and prodigies appear utterly surprizing and unknown to the King himself till they are explained to be the wonders of his own reign now commencing On this subject  Settle  breaks into a congratulation yet not unmix'd with concern that his own times were but the types of these He prophecies bow first the nation shall be overrun with Farces Opera's and Shows and the throne of Dulness advanced over both the Theatres Then how her sons shall preside in the seats of Arts and sciences till in conclusion all shall return to their original Chaos▪ A scene of which the present Action of the Dunciad is but a Type or Foretaste giving a Glimpse or  Pisgahsight  of the promis'd Fulnefs of her Glory the Accomplishment whereof will in all probability hereafter be the Theme of many other and greater Dunciads  BUT in her Temple's last recess inclos'd  On Dulness lap th' Anointed head repos'd  Him close she curtain'd round with vapours blue  And soft besprinkled with  Cimmerian  dew  Then raptures high the seat of sense o'erflow  Which only heads refin'd from reason know  Hence from the straw where  Bedlam  's Prophet nods  He hears loud Oracles and talks with Gods  Hence the Fool's paradise the Statesman's scheme  The airbuilt Castle and the golden Dream  The Maid's romantic wish the Chymist's flame  And Poet's vision of eternal fame  And now on Fancy's easy wing convey'd  The King descended to th'  Elyzian  Shade  There in a dusky vale where  Lethe  rolls  Old  Bavius  sits to dip poetic Souls  And blunt the sense and fit it for a scull  Of solid proof impenetrably dull  Instant when dipt away they wing their flight  Where  Brown  and  Mears  unbar the gates of Light  Demand new bodies and in Calf's array  Rush to the world impatient for the day  Millions and millions on these banks he views  Thick as the stars of night or morning dews  As thick as bees o'er vernal blossoms fly  As thick as eggs at  Ward  in Pillory  Wond'ring he gaz'd When lo a Sage appears  By his broad shoulders known and length of ears  Known by the band and suit which  Settle  wore  His only suit for twice three years before  All as the vest

wonders of th' oblivious Lake  Thou yet unborn hast touch'd this sacred shore  The hand of  Bavius  drench'd thee o'er and o'er  But blind to former as to future Fate  What mortal knows his preexistent state  Who knows how long thy transmigrating soul  Might from  Boeotian  to  Boeotian  roll  How many  Dutchmen  she vouchsaf'd to third  How many stages thro' old Monks she rid  And all who since in mild benighted days  Mix'd the Owl's ivy with the Poet's bays  As man's maeanders to the vital spring  Roll all their tydes then back their circles bring  Or whirligigs twirl'd round by skilful swain  Suck the thread in then yield it out again  All nonsense thus of old or modern date  Shall in thee center from thee circulate  For this our Queen unfolds to vision true  Thy mental eye for thou hast much to view  Old scehes of glory times long cast behind  Shall first recall'd rush forward to thy mind  Then stretch thy sight o'er all her rising reign  And let the past and future fire thy brain  Ascend this hill whose cloudy point commands  Her boundless empire over seas and lands  See round the Poles where keener spangles shine  Where spices smoke beneath the burning Line  Earth's wide extreams her sable flag display'd  And all the nations cover'd in her shade  Far eastward cast thine eye from whence the Sun  And orient Science at a birth begun  One godlike Monarch all

ev'n the  Antipodes Vigilius  mourn  See the Cirque falls th' unpillar'd Temple nods  Streets pav'd with Heroes  Tyber  choak'd with Gods  Till  Peter  's keys some christen'd  Jove  adorn  And  Pan

the dreamer's brain and not a real or intended satire on the present Age doubtless more learned more inlighten'd and more abounding with great Genius's in Divinity Politics and whatever arts and sciences than all the preceding For fear of any such mistake of our Poet's honest meaning he hath again at the  end of the Vision repeated this monition saying that it all past thro' the  Ivory gate  which according to the Ancients denoteth Falsity  SCRIBLERUS  V  Old  Bavius  sits  Bavius  was an ancient Poet celebrated by  Virgil  for the like cause as  Tibbald  by our author tho' not in so christianlike a manner For  heathenishly it is declar'd by  Virgil  of  Bavius  that he ought to be  hated  and  detested  for his evil works  Qui Bavium non  odit whereas we have often had occasion to observe our Poet's great good nature and mercifulness thro' the whole course of this poem  Mr  Dennis  warmly contends that  Bavius  was no inconsiderable author nay that  "he and  Maevius  had even in  Augustus  's days a very formidable Party at  Rome  who thought them much superior to  Virgil  and  Horace  " For saith he "I cannot believe they would have fixed that eternal brand upon them if they had not been coxcombs in more than ordinary credit"  Rem on  Pr Arthur  part c An argument which if this Poem should last will conduce to the honour of the Gentlemen of the  Dunciad  In like manner he tells us of  Settle  that  "he was once a formidable Rival to Mr  Dryden  and that in the University of  Cambridge  there were those who gave him the  preference  "  Mr  Welsted  goes yet farther in his behalf  "Poor  Settle  was formerly the  Mighty Rival  of  Dryden  nay  for many years  bore his reputation  above  him"  Pref to his  Poems  vo  p  And Mr  Milbourn  cried out  "How little was  Dryden  able even when his blood run high to defend himself against Mr  Settle  "  Notes on  Dryd Virg  p  These are comfortable opinions and no wonder some authors indulge them  SCRIBLERUS  V  Brown  and  Mears  Booksellers Printers for  Tibbald  Mrs  Haywood  or any bodyThe Allegory of the souls of the dull coming forth in the form of books drest in calve's leather and being let abroad in vast numbers by Booksellers is sufficiently intelligible  V Ward  in Pillory John Ward  of  Hackney  Esq  Member of Parliament being convicted of Forgery was first expelled the House and then sentenc'd  to the Pillory on the th of  Febr  Mr  Curl  having likewise stood there looks upon the mention of such a Gentleman in a satire as a  great act of Barbarity Key to the  Dunc  d Edit p  And another Author thus reasons upon it  Durgen  vo pag  "How unworthy is it of  Christian Charity  to animate the  rabble  to abuse a  worthy man  in such a situation What could move the Poet thus to mention a  brave Sufferer  a  gallant Prisoner  exposed to the view of all mankind It was laying aside his  Senses  it was committing a  Crime  for which the  Law is deficient  not to punish him nay a Crime which  Man can scarce forgive  nor  Time efface  Nothing surely could have induced him to it but being bribed by a great Lady"  to whom this brave honest worthy Gentleman was guilty of no offence but Forgery proved in open Court c But it is evident this verse could not be meant of him it being notorious that no  Eggs  were thrown at that Gentleman Perhaps therefore it might be intended of Mr  Edward Ward  the Poet  V  And length of Ears  This is a  sophisticated  reading I think I may venture to affirm all the Copyists are mistaken here I believe I may say the same of the Critics  Dennis Oldmixon Welsted  have pass'd it in silence I have also stumbled at it and wonder'd how an error so manifest could escape such accurate persons I dare assert it proceeded originally from  the inadvertency of some Transcriber whose head run on the  Pillory  mention'd two lines before It is therefore amazing that Mr  Curl  himself should overlook it Yet that  Scholiast  takes not the least notice hereof That the learned  Mist  also read it thus is plain from his ranging this passage among those in which our Author was blamed for  personal Satire  on a  Man  's  Face  whereof doubtless he might take the  Ear  to be a part So likewise  Concanen Ralph  the  FlyingPost  and all the Herd of Commentators  Tota armenta sequuntur  A very little Sagacity which all these Gentlemen therefore wanted will restore to us the true sense of the Poet thus  By his broad Shoulders known and length of  years See how easy a change of one single letter That Mr  Settle  was old is most certain but he

to this Pope at the same time that he mentions one of the strangest effects of this excess of zeal in him  Doctor sanctissimus ille Gregorius qui melleo praedicationis imbre totam rigavit inebriavit

scarce destroyed more monuments of Antiquity out of rage than these out of devotion At length they spared some of the Temples by converting them to Churches and some of the Statues by modifying them into images of Saints In much later times it was thought necessary to change the statues of  Apollo  and  Pallas  on the tomb of  Sannazarius  into  David  and  Judith  the Lyre easily became a Harp

my  Judgment  otherwise he would never have subscribed  Two Guineas  to me for one small Book in Octavo"  Jacob  's Letter to  Dennis  in his Remarks on the  Dunciad pag Therefore I  should think the Appellation of  Blunderbuss  to Mr  Jacob  like that of  Thunderbolt  to  Scipio  was meant in his honour  Mr  Dennis  argues the same way  "My writings having made great impression on the minds of all sensible men Mr  Prepented  and to  give proof of his Repentance  subscribed to my two volumes of select Worksand afterwards to my two volumes of Letters"  Ibid  pag We should hence believe the

to it the following different character of him  Mr  Welsted  had in his youth rais'd so great expectations of his future genius that there was a  kind of struggle  between the most eminent in the two Universities  which  should have the honour of his education To  compound  this he  civilly  became a member of both and after having pass'd some time at the one he removed to the other From thence he return'd to town where he became the  darling Expectation  of  all the  polite Writers whose encouragement he acknowledg'd in his occasional poems in a manner that  will make no small part of the Fame  of his protectors It also appears from his  Works  that he was happy in the patronage of the most illustrious characters of the present ageIncourag'd by such a  Combination  in his favour hepublish'd a book of poems some in the  Ovidian  some in the  Horatian  manner in both which the most exquisit Judges pronounce he even  rival'd his masters  His Loveverses have rescued that way of writing from

be mention'd but twice and so flightly touch'd in this poem But in truth he look'd upon him with some esteem for having more generously than all the rest  set his Name  to such writings He was also a very old man at this time By his own account of himself in Mr  Jacoh  's  Lives  he must have been above threescore in the mayoralty of Sir  George Thorold  in and hath since happily lived ten years more So that he is already senior to Mr  Durfey  who hitherto of all our Poets enjoy'd the longest Bodily life  V  Fam'd for good nature  Burnet c Ducket  for pious passion to the youth  The first of these was son of the late bishop of  S  Author of a weekly paper called  The Grumbler  as the other was concerned in another call'd  Pasquin  in which Mr  Pope  was abused with the late Duke of  Buckingham  and Bishop of  Rochester  They also joined in a piece against his first undertaking to translate the  Iliad  intitled  Homerides  by Sir  Iliad Dogrel  prtnted Mr  Curl  gives us this further account of Mr  Burnet  "He did  himself write  a Letter to the E of  Hallifax informing his Lordship  as he tells him  of what he knew much better before  And  he published  in his own name  several political pamphlets A certain information of a certain discourse A second Tale of a Tub c  All which  it is strongly affirmed  were written by  Colonel  Ducket  "  CURL  Key  p But the author of the  Characters of the Times  tells us these political pieces were not approv'd of by his  own Father  the Reverend Bishop  Of the other works of these Gentlemen the world has heard no more than it would of Mr  Pope's  had their united laudable endeavours discourag'd him from his undertaking How few good works had ever appear'd since men of true merit are always the least presuming had there been always such champions to stifle them in their conception And were it not better for the publick that a million of monsters should come into the world which are sure to die as soon as born than that the Serpents should strangle one  Hercules  in his cradle  The Union of these two Authors gave occasion to this Epigram  Burnet  and  Ducket  friends in spite  Came hissing forth in Verse  Both

for pious passion to the youth  The verse is a literal translation of  Virgil Nisus amore pio pueri  and here as in the original apply'd to Friendship That between  Nisus  and  Euryalus  is allowed to make one of the most amiable Episodes in the world and surely was never interpreted in a perverse sense But it will astonish the reader to hear that on no other occasion than this line a Dedication was written to this Gentleman to induce him to think something further  "Sir you are known to have all that affection for the beautiful part of the creation which God and Nature design'dSir you have a very sine Ladyand Sir you have eight very sine Children c"  Dedic to  Dennis  Rem on the Rape of the Lock  The truth is the poor Dedicator's brain was turn'd upon this article he had taken into his head that ever since some books were written against the  Stage  and since the  Italian Opera  had prevail'd the nation was infected with a vice not fit to be nam'd He went so far as to print upon the subject and concludes  his argument with this remark  "that he cannot help thinking the Obscenity of Plays excusable at this juncture since when that execrable sin is spread so wide it may be of use to the reducing mens minds to the natural desire of women"  DENNIS  Stage defended  against Mr  Law  p Our author solemnly declared he never heard any creature but the Dedicator mention that Vice and

READ  his ear  But in the last spurious editions of the singing Psalms the word READ is changed into  men  I say spurious editions because not only here but quite throughout the whole book of Psalms are strange alterations all for the worse And yet the titlepage stands as it used to do and all which is abominable in any book much more in a sacred work is ascribed to  Thomas Sternhold John Hopkins

APPENDIX  I  PREFACE  prefix'd to the five first imperfect Editions of the  DUNCIAD  printed at  Dublin  and  London  in  Octavo  and  Duod  The Publisher  Who he was is uncertain but  Edward Ward  tells us in his preface to  Durgen  "that most judges are of opinion this preface is not of  English  extraction but  Hibernian  c"  He means Dr  Swift  who whether publisher or not may be said in a sort to be author of the poem For when he together with Mr  Pope  for reasons specify'd in the preface to their Miscellanies determin'd to own the most trifling pieces in which they had any hand and to destroy all that remain'd in their power the first sketch of this poem was snatch'd from the fire by Dr  Swift  who persuaded his friend to proceed in it and to him it was therefore inscribed But the occasion of printing it was as follows  There was publish'd in those Miscellanies a Treatise of the  Bathos  or  Art of Sinking in Poetry  in which was a chapter where the species of bad writers were rang'd in classes and initial letters of names prefix'd for the most part at random But such was the number of poets eminent in that art that some one or other took every letter to himself All fell into so violent a fury that for half a year or more the common Newspapers in most of which they had some property as being hired writers were filled with the most abusive falshoods and scurrilities they could possibly devise A liberty no ways to be wonder'd at in those people and in those papers that for many years during the uncontrolled license of the press had aspersed almost all the great characters of the age and this with impunity their own persons and names being utterly secret and obscure This gave Mr  Pope  the thought that he had now some opportunity of doing good by  and dragging into light these common enemies of mankind since to invalidate this universal slander it sufficed to shew what contemptible men were the authors of it He was not without hopes that by manifesting the dullness of those who had only malice to recommend them either the booksellers would not find their account in employing them or the men themselves when discovered want courage to proceed in so unlawful an occupation This it was that gave birth to the  Dunciad  and he thought an happiness that by the late flood of slander on himself he had acquired such a peculiar right over their names as was necessary to his design  The  PUBLISHER  to the  READER  IT will be found a true observation tho' somewhat surprizing that when any scandal is vented against a man of the highest distinction and character either in the State or in Literature the publick  In general afford it a most quiet reception and the arger part accept it as favourably as if it were some  kindness done to themselves whereas if a known scoundrel or blockhead but chance to be touch'd upon a whole legion is up in arms and it becomes the common cause of all Scriblers Booksellers and Printers whatsoever  Not to search too deeply into the reason hereof I will only observe as a fact that every week for these two months past the town has been persecuted with  Pamphlets Advertisements  c See the list of these anonymous papers with their dates and authors thereunto annexed in the third article of this Appendix  pamphlets advertisements letters and weekly essays not only against the wit and writings but against the character and person of Mr  Pope  And that of all those men who have received pleasure from his works which by modest computation may be about a  About a hundred thousand  It is surprizing with what stupidity this preface which is almost a continued irony was taken by those authors This passage among others they understood to be serious  hundred thousand in these Kingdoms of  England  and  Ireland  not to mention  Jersey Guernsey  the  Orcades  those in the New world and Foreigners who have translated him into their languages of all this number not a man hath stood up to say one word in his defence  The only exception is the  The Author of the following Poem  c A very plain irony speaking of Mr  Pope  himself  author of the following poem who doubtless had either better insight into the grounds of this clamour or better opinion of Mr  Pope  's integrity join'd with a greater personal love for him than any other of his numerous friends and admirers  Further that he was in his peculiar intimacy appears from the knowledge he manifests of the most private authors of all the anonymous pieces against him and from his having in this poem attacked  The publisher in these words went a little too far but it is certain whatever names the reader finds that are unknown to him are of such and the exception is only of two or three whose dulness or scurrility all mankind agreed to have justly entitled them to a place in the  Dunciad  no man living who had not before printed or published some scandal agaist this gentleman  How I came possest of it is of no concern to the reader but it would have been a wrong to him had I detain'd this publication since those names which are its chief ornaments die off daily so fast as must render it too soon unintelligible If it provoke the author to give us a more perfect edition I have my end  Who he is I cannot say and which is great pity there is certainly  There is certainly nothing in his Style  c This irony had small effect in concealing the author The  Dunciad  imperfect as it was had not been publish'd two days but the whole town gave it to Mr  Pope  nothing in his style and manner of writing which can distinguish or discover him For if it bears any resemblance to that of Mr  Pope  'tis not improbable but it might be done on purpose with a view to have it pass for his But by the frequency of his allusions to  Virgil  and a labour'd not to say affected  shortness  in imitation of him I should think him more an admirer of the  Roman  poet than of the  Grecian  and in that not of the same taste with his friend  I have been well inform'd that this work was the labour of full  The labour of full six years  c This also was honestly and seriously believ'd by divers of the gentlemen of the  Dunciad J Ralph  pref to  Sawney  "We are told it was the labour of six years with the utmost assiduity and application It is no great compliment to the author's sense to have employ'd so large a part of his life c"  So also  Ward  pref to  Durgen  "The  Dunciad  as the publisher very wisely confesses cost the author six years retirement from all the pleasures of life tho' it is somewhat difficult to conceive from either its bulk or beauty that it could be so long in hatching c But the length of time and closeness of application were mention'd to prepossess the reader with a good opinion of it"  They just as well understood what  Scriblerus  said of this poem  six years of his life and that he wholly  retired himself from all the avocations and pleasures of the world to attend diligently to its correction and perfection and six years more he intended to bestow upon it as it should seem by this verse of  Statius  which was cited at the head of his manuscript  Oh mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos  The prefacer to  curl  's  Key  took this word to be really in  Statius  "By a quibble on the word  Duncia  the  Dunciad  is formed"  pag  Mr  Ward  also follows him in the same opinion  Duncia  Hence also we learn the true title of the Poem which with the same certainty as we call that of  Homer  the  Iliad  of  Virgil  the  Aeneid  of  Camoens  the  Lusiad  of  Voltaire  the  The Henriad  The  French  poem of  Monsieur Voltaire  entitled  La Henriade  had been publish'd at  London  the year before    Henriad  we may pronounce could have been and can be no other than  The DUNCIAD  It is styled  Heroic  as being  doubly  so not only with respect to its nature which according to the best rules of the ancients and strictest ideas of the moderns is critically such but also with regard to the heroical disposition and high courage of the writer who dar'd to stir up such a formidable irritable and implacable race of mortals  The time and date of the Action is evidently in the last reign when the office of City poet expir'd  upon the death of  Elkanah Settle  and it is fix'd to the Mayoralty of Sir  Geo Thorold  But there may arise some obscurity in Chronology from the  names  in the poem by the inevitable removal of some authors and insertion of others in their niches For whoever will consider the unity of the whole design will be sensible that the  Poem was not made for these Authors but these Authors for the Poem  I should judge that they were clapp'd in as they rose fresh and fresh and chang'd from day to day in like manner as when the old boughs wither we thrust new ones into a chimney  I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious if he cannot decypher them since when he shall have found them out he will probably know no more of the persons than before  Yet we judg'd it better to preserve them as they are than to change them for fictitious 'names by which the satire would only be multiplied and applied to many instead of one Had the Hero for instance been called  Codrus  how many would have affirm'd him to have been Mr  W  Mr  D  Sir  R B  c but now all that unjust scandal is saved by calling him  Theobald  which by good luck happens to be the name of a real person  I am indeed aware that this name may to some appear too mean for the Hero of an Epic Poem But it is hoped they will alter that opinion when they find that an author no less eminent than  la Bruyere  has honour'd him with frequent mention and thought him worthy a place in his characters  Voudriez vous  THEOBALDE
