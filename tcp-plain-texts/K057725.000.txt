universal Applause at the Theatre Royal CoventGarden  PROLOGUE  Written by Mr CHALMERS  Spoken by Mr WHITFIELD  FORTH from the closet to the improving stage  We bring the beauties of poor Yorick's page  In doing so we but fulfil his plan  To draw in public view the heart of man  To make the stage a vehicle of wit  And every varied humour kindly hit  To raise your sympathy by gentle force  And reconcile man to his hobbyhorse  Sterne's hobbyhorse was sympathy of mind  And we in this night's piece get up behind  Retain his jokes keep pity on the trot  Leave out digressions and connect by plot  Bring Toby's goodness and his antique whim  The Doctor's foible and the soul of Trim  In their odd fancies we our own perceive  For on some hobby horse all mankind live  The politician whose allconquering pate  Is fill'd with nothing but affairs of state  In one short evening with his pint of beer  Scudds o'er the acts of many a distant year  Tells you how Marlbro' foughthow it had been  If heroes now could emulate Eugene  With broken pipe describes the bloody field  Retakes the captured makes the victor yield  Regains our honour by postdated schemes  And credit lost last age in this redeems  Yet modern victors have their hobby too  In bringing ancient valour to our view  Eager our foes to humble fame to gain  By way of hobbyhorse they ride the main  Some strive for bucks and bloods themselves to pass  Poor men their hobby's neither horse nor ass  Heedless they gallop on their mongrel beast  And heedless fall when they expect it least  Some on less dang'rous hobbies whip along  Fickle in taste in prejudices strong  Or dress or books their every thought engage  And e'en to some good eating is the rage  See Gobble clear the plate and by mere force  Keeps riding one'en in the second course  Each rides apace nor fears his horse may stumble  The very best of riders should be humble  Since to dismount them all our art defies  Let them ride gentlythere the merit lies  Let them not kick to cause the in weaker fall  The world God knows is wide enough for all  Our fav'rite hobby is to hit your taste  When you are pleas'd some hours with us to waste  To night our author every merit stakes  And this gay ring his place of starting makes  Former success inspires with hopes to win  Let not the knowing ones be taken in  Spur our ambition then in this night's course  And Tristram Shandy make your hobbyhorse  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Mr SHANDY  Mr HULL  Capt SHANDY  Mr WILSON  TRIM  Mr EDWIN  Dr SLOP  Mr WEWITZER  OBADIAH  Mr FEARON  Mrs WADMAN  Mrs MORTON  SUSANNAH

attending  Shan  WELL you tell me love has made a a progress in both their bosoms but say Trim how does my brother Toby stand the assaults of the widow Wadman  Trim  An't please your honor he has capitulatedthe Captain has taken in love as he has taken in every thing elsehe has taken it in like a lamb  Sus  And the Widow Wadman I assure you Sir is as far gone as the Captainpoor gentlewoman she has taken in love like a lamb too  Shan  Then must we pursue our schemeYou must continue Trim to keep the Captain's flame alive and you Susan must lay fresh fuel upon  the widow's fire this peace Trim will break my poor brother's heart unless we get employment for his mind I have philosophiz'd with him in vainnothing but love can soothe himLove Trimmark SusannahLove is a passion derived from heaven  Trim  Yes your honor and it replenishes the earth  Shan  Where is my brother  Trim  An't please your honor he's gone over to the Inn to visit poor Lieutenant Lefevre  Shan  Then I'll go to himTrim drink success to the Captain  gives money  If the widow gets this brother of mine she gets an invaluable treasure he has'nt a heart to hurt a flyGo says he one day to an overgrown one which he had caught as it buzz'd about his nose and tormented him cruelly poor devil I'll not hurt a hair of thy head Go said he lifting up the sash the world is wide enough for thee and meIt was a lesson which might serve governors and parents better than a whole volume on the subject of humanity  Exit Shandy  Trim  My master his honor the captain and your master his worship Mr Shandy could not be match'd in a day's march Susangood hearts when the unfortunate claim assistance they fling down their money with that spirited jerk of an honest welcome with which generous souls only are able to fling down moneyFor each man's sorrow they have a tear for each man's need they have a shillingmay heaven ever bless them both  Sus  La Mr Trim I thought as how you gentlemen of the army never pray'd  Trim  It is not half an hour Susan since I heard Lieutenant Lefevre a soldier and a brave  soldier pray devoutly a soldier Susan prays as often of his own accord as a parson and when he's fighting for his king and for his country and for his own life and for his honor too he has the most reason to pray to heaven of any man in the world  Sus  Very true Mr Trim  Trim  But when a soldier my dear girl has been standing twelve hours in the trenches  Sus  A great while to stand indeed Mr Trim  Trim  Up to his knees in cold water or engag'd in long and dangerous marches harrass'd in his rear today harrassing others tomorrowdetach'd here  wheeling to right  countermanded there  wheeling to the left  resting this night perhaps upon his armsbeat up the next in his shirt benumb'd in his joints without straw in his tent to kneel on he must say his prayers how and when he can  Sus  And it's my opinion when a soldier gets time to pray he prays as heartily as any parson of them all though not with so much fuss and hypocrisy  Trim  Don't say that Susan heaven only knows who is hypocrite and who is not at the great and general review of all and not till then it will be seen who have deserted from their duty in this world and who have stood to their posts and we shall be advanced accordingly  standing upright  Sus  And it will never be enquired whether we were flaunting fine ladies or humble servant maids  Trim  No sweet Susan nor whether we did our duty in a red coat or a black oneBut to business Susan the Captain is certainly smitten  what marks of love have you perceived in the widow  Sus  Why she nightly reads over her marriagesettlement and every time she reads cries for her first husbanda strong sign that she's thinking of a secondBut do you know the marks of love Mr Trim  Trim  Know them I have felt them Susannah  pressing her hand  But say what dost thou think of love thyself my girl  Sus  I can tell you what it is through the whole alphabet parson Yorick taught me You must give me the letter Mr Trim just as you give the word of commandbegin with A  Trim  Very wellnow mind the wordtake care  as he gives the word he exercises with his stick and as she answers she reckons with the forefinger of her right hand upon her left hand  Trim  A  Sus  Agitation  Trim  B  Sus  Bewitching  Trim  C  Sus  Charming  Trim  D  Sus  Delightful or dev'lish which you please in short Love is the most Eextravagant F funny Ggigglish Hhumorous Iinteresting KO there is no key to it  Trim  What no key to love Susannah O there is a keyWell go on  Sus  Love is the most Llonging Mmisguiding Nnatural Othe O expresses its own meaning its the same with the heighho  sighs  Ppleasant Qquarrelsome Rrapturous but here comes Obadiah so the next time we  meet I'll give you the S T U W X Y and Z of love  Trim  With the  et caetera  I hope Susanfor the  et caetera  is worth the whole alphabet  Enter  OBADIAH  Oba  Alas alas Corporal as sure as I'm alive the poor Lieutenant at the inn will dieand yet he was better this morning  Trim    standing in the middle    Alas    extending his right arm    What is this morning or any other morning to the time presentAre we not here now    setting his stick perpendicular    and are we not gone in a moment  Dropping his hat  Sus  O yes gone in a moment  Weeps  Trim  I own that since the morning it is not long till now it is nothing but to those Obadiah who know not what death is and what havoc and destruction he can make before a man can wheel about    wheeling    it is a whole age  Oba  How learnedly the Corporal preaches  Trim  O Obadiah O Susannah it would make a good natur'd man's heart bleed to consider how many a brave upright fellow hath been laid low since that timeTrust me Susan before that time comes again many a bright eye will be dim  Points to Susan's eye  Sus  Yes Mr Trim many a bright eye will be dim  Curtsies and rubs her eyes  Trim  Are we not like the flower of the field  Looking at Susan  Sus  Yes we are like the flowers of the field  Smiles  Trim  Is not all flesh grass  Looking at Obadiah  Oba  Yesall flesh is grass  Trim  'Tis clay 'tis dirt    points to Obadiah    What is the finest face that a man ever look'd on  pointing to Susan  Sus  I could hear Trim talk for ever  Trim  What is the finest face    taps Susan's cheek she lays her hand up  n his shoulder and smiles    What is it but corruption    she takes away her hand    Out of doors I value not death at all not this    snapping his fingers    Let him not take me cowardly what is he a pull of a trigger a push of a bayonet The best way is to stand up to him the man who flies is in ten times more danger than he who marches up to his jaws I have look'd him an hundred times in his face Death is nothing in the field  Oba  But he's woundedly frightful in the house  Sus  For my part I think it's most natural to meet him in bed  Trim  And could I escape him in bed by creeping into the worst calfskin that ever was made into a knapsack I'd do it therebut that is nature  Oba  Well I must go see after the sick cow tho' I could hear the corporal for ever  Exit Obadiah  Trim  There's Captain Shandy fears not death he fears only what every honest man fearsdoing a wrong thing He's as kind an officer as ever stepp'd before a platoon and would march up to the muzzle of a cannon tho' there were a lighted match at the touchhole He'll take care of Lefevre's sonI'd serve him to the day of my death for love  Sus  And I'd sooner be his servant for seven pounds a year than serve other people for eight  Trim  Thank thee for thy twenty shillings a year as much Susan as if thou puttest the money into my own pocket I must kiss thee for it Susan  Kisses her  Enter  OBADIAH  calling    Oba  Susay Susan Susannah you are call'd for here

coachhorse wants a shoe  Trim  Don't take him poor creature  Oba  The Scotch horse is gall'd and can't bear a saddle upon his back  Sus  Take Patriot Obadiah  Oba  Patriot ah Susan nopoor Patriot's sold Well I'll e'en borrow the miller's carthorse or walk for better to walk thro' thick and thin all the days of a man's life than to ride a poor unshod devil or a devil with a gall'd back that must feel pain every inch of the roadBut I forgot master's returned from the inn and would speak with you Mr Trim  Trim  Farewell Susan when the widow comes remember your master's instructionsSusan we must all marry  Exit Trim and Obadiah  Sus  Well 'tis twenty to one but mistress dies this boutpoor gentlewoman she has always had a hard time and she has as good cloaths as any lady in the county and

   Enter  SHANDY  and  TRIM  as  SUSAN  goes out  Shan  Why Susan Susan they are calling for you all over the houseaway my girl away    Exit Susan    Should the Lieutenant die Trim 'twould go to my brother's heart so let's pursue our scheme against him and the widow with all expedition  Trim  And please your honor I fear I shall want spirits  Shan  Nay Trim never be gravegravity is an errant scoundrel and of the most dangerous kind toobecause a sly one more honest well meaning people are bubbled out of their goods and monies by gravity in a twelvemonth than by pocket picking and shoplifting in seven years Here comes my brother I'll step into the library to overlook my catalogue of christian names but will come out if I see occasion  Enter  CAPTAIN SHANDY  on a Crutch  TRIM  hands a Chair  TOBY  sits  Capt  I have seen the Lieutenant Trim he is the same Lefevre who serv'd at Angus's at Breda and whose wife was unfortunately kill'd by a musket ball as she lay in his arms in his tent  Trim  I remember the story an't please your honor  Capt  Then well may the poor Lieutenant remember itwhen you waited on the Lieutenant and made him an offer of my services did  you offer him my purseSickness and travelling are both expensive and thou knowest he was a poor Lieutenant with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his payThou should'st have made him an offer of my purse because if he stood in need Trim thou knowest he had been as welcome to it as myself  Trim  Your honor knows I had no orders  Capt  True    rising    thou had'st not orders and thou did'st very right Trim as a soldier but very ill as a man    sits Trim bows    Then when thou offeredst whatever was in my house thou should'st have offered him my house too    Trim bows    A sick brother officer should have the best quarters Trim and what with my care and thy care and the old woman's care and his boy's care we might recruit him again and set him on his legs    rises    In a fortnight or three weeks he might march  Putting forward his right leg  Shandy peeping  Precious souls what are their two noddles together about  Trim  He will never march an't please your honor in this world  Drawing

Capt  He shall not die byheaven  Trim  Don't swear your honor  SHANDY  comes forward  Shan  Your hand brotherthe accusing spirit which flew up to heaven's chancery with thy oath blush'd as he gave it in and the recording angel as he wrote it down dropp'd a tear upon the word that blotted it out for everBut consider dear Toby all must die monarchs princes dance in the same ring with us  Capt  Has the widow been here Trim  Shan  Kingdoms and provinces towns and cities have they not their period when those principles and powers which first put them together  Capt  Brother brother    laying his hand upon his breast    I hope you except this country from your principles and powers there was no principle in the powers which oppose her and she has now principle and power sufficient within herself to keep her firm upon her own broad basis  Trim  Yes an't please your honor and having justice on her side she's able to drive France and Spain andand the devil if he should join them out of the field  Shan  The approaches of death Toby make but little alteration in a great manVespasian died in a jest Galba with a sentence Septimus Severus with a dispatch Tiberius with dissimulation and Caesar Augustus with a compliment  Capt whistles Lillibullero  Trim  I hope your honor it was a sincere one  Shan  It was to his wife Trimbut lastly comes the anecdote which like the gilded dome  crowns in allnever did man receive such severe lashes as Cornelius Gallus  Capt  The greatest number of lashes I ever saw given was to a grenadier in Mackay's regiment  Trim  O heav'ns he was innocent yet he was flogg'd to death's door they had better shot him outright as he begg'd and he'd have gone to heaven directly  Weeps  Capt  It was a misfortune great as ever the eye of pity dropp'd a tear onit would be a pity Trim thou should'st ever feel sorrows of thy own thou feel'st so tenderly for othersBut whilst thy master has a shilling thou shalt not ask elsewhere for a penny  DR SLOP  without  Slop  Scoundrel I wish you hang'd I wish you shot  Capt  This cursing Dr Slop is no more than sparrow shot fired again a bastion Our armies swore terribly in Flanders Doctor but nothing to thisMy heart would not let me curse the devil with so much bitterness  Slop  The devil's damn'd already to all eternity  Capt  Poor devil    sighs    I'm sorry for him  Slop  That rascal Obadiah has injur'd me  Oba  No Doctor I would not injure a toad from my heart and I's no rascal and I scorn a lieI met Mr Doctor an't please you coming slowly along waddling thro' the dirt at a duck's gait upon his little poney the poor beast scarce able to set foot to ground under its heavy burden for the Doctor is a mortal load of human flesh as you mon seehe he he  Slop  Who do you laugh at Sirrah I was coming to pay my devoirs to the widow Wadman not knowing of your lady's alarm when this fellow came posting down the narrow lane at a monstrous and tremendous rate mounted on a huge cart horse prick'd into a full gallop  Oba  It was the miller's old troop horse and 'tis as good natur'd a beast  Slop  As yourself Sirrahyou came splashing and plunging like a devil thro' thick and thin a phenomenon with a vortex of mud and water round its axisWhat must be my terror and hydrophobia when advancing warily in an ambling motion this Obadiah and his miller's troop horse turns a corner furious pop full upon me  Oba  But Doctor you were in fault for you looked round when I cried out to you to hold the pummel of the saddle and in looking round you let go your whip and attempting to save your whip you lost your seat  Shan  And when the Doctor lost his seat he lost his presence of mind  Oba  And before I was near him your honor he fell from his poney for all the world like a pack of wool quite at his ease with the broader part of him sunk in the mud twelve inches  Laughs  Slop  You're an illmanner'd knave  Oba  Nay as to my manners did'nt I pull off my hat twice once when your worship was falling  laughs  and again when I saw you in the mud  Laughs  Enter  SUSAN  Sus  My poor mistress is ready to faint and the drops are spilt and the bottle of julip is broken the nurse has cut her arm

 Capt    taking the other boot    Then I fear Trim has cut off the entail  Trim  Cut off the tailno please your honor  taking the boot from Toby  I have only cut off the top  Shan  I hate perpetuities

heart  Shan  Trim step into the kitchen and enquire how things go on up stairs    exit Trim    Brother Toby you care not what money you throw away provided it is upon a siegeDear Toby these military operations are above your strength and will in the end quite ruin and make a beggar of youWhat's your modern artillery to the battering rams of the ancients to the catapulta  Enter  TRIM  Trim  An't please your honor there is no one soul in the kitchen except Dr Slop  Shan  Some retrogade planet is hanging over this house of mine turning every thing out of its placeI thought the Doctor had been with Mrs Shandy what can he be puzzling about in the kitchen  Trim  He's buzy an't please your honor in making a bridge  Capt  It's very obliging in himPray give my humble service to Dr Slop and tell him I thank him heartilyHe's making his bridge I suppose after the model of the Marquis de Hospitals  Trim  Heaven bless your honor it's a bridge for young master's nose  Shan  Confusion  Trim  Madam has got a son but Dr Slop as Susan told me on the stair head has crush'd his nose as flat as a pancake and is making a false  bridge with a piece of cotton and a bit of whalebone to raise it up  Shan  Lead me brother Toby lead me to my room this instant  Toby  Keep up your spiritsMeet me presently in the bowlinggreen with the mortars Trim  Shan  Crush'd his nose O heavenO unfortunate mutilated child  ACT II  SCENE  a Room  WIDOW WADMAN  and  SUSAN  Widow  AND are you convinc'd Susan that Capt Shandy intends paying his addresses to me  Sus  No Madam the Captain is as mild as new milk and Trim says he loves you better than gunpowder yet indeed Madam he is so modest a gentleman that you must c  urt him  Wid  And you'll sound the Corporal upon what I have spoken to you you know the Captain has been wounded and one would not wish to turn nurse and marry a patientHere comes the Corporal so remember your business  Exit  Sus  Yes I'll discover every thing for this poor widow I'll

that the Captain can never recover his woundDr Slop says he cannot  Trim  Upon my life Susan the Doctor's insinuations are as false as hellbut why do'st thou ask thou art good and modest by nature and so generous a girl thou would'st not wound an insect much less the honor of so  worthy and gallant a soul as my masterThou hast been set on and deluded Susan as is often a woman's case to please others more than themselves whose suspicion has misled theeTell me for by my Montero cap I love thee  Sus  Do you really love me To be sure you soldiers are the cleanest neatest uprightest menand

lose themselves  Exit Susan  Enter  TOBY  Trim  I believe your honor I am going to say a foolish kind of a thing for a soldier  Toby  A soldier Trim is no more exempt from saying foolish things than a man of letters  Trim  But a soldier your honor does not say foolish things so often as a man of lettersSince the peace your honor I have never once whistled  nor laughed nor cried nor talk'd of past done deeds nor told your honor a good nor a bad story  Toby  I have remark'd it Trim  Trim  Then since the war is over your honor we should look for other employmentWe have wounded the widow Wadman and I believe your honor she has returned the fire  Toby  She has attacked my breast works from the battery of her eyes and has left a ball here  Pointing to his heart  Trim  Your honor must attack her in return she can no more stand a siege than she can fly we'll get your honor's regimentals brushed up and I'll put your ramilie wig in pipes  Toby  And get some chalk for my sword  Trim  It will be in your honor's waybut when your honor is shaved and your clean shirt on and every thing ready for the attack we will match up to the widow as boldly as to the face of a bastion  Toby  I declare Corporal I'd rather march up to the edge of a Trench  Trim  A Trench your honor a woman is quite a different thingBut I must retire your honor for here comes the widow running down the gallery like

Toby  As I am a soldier Mrs Wadman it is in vain I have reconnoitered every corner and can see nothing Widowbut firefire shooting from every part  Wid  It is easy nowwell the eye is the most tender part about usand the most ornamental  Toby  And the most dangerous Madaman eye is for all the world in this respect exactly like a cannon that it is not so much the eye nor the cannon themselves as it is the carriage of the eye and the carriage of the cannon by which both the one and the other are enabled to do so much execution  Wid  Then there are many kinds of eyes  Toby  Yes widow and many kinds of cannon  Wid  The rolling eye  Toby  And the battering cannon  Wid  The commanding eye  Toby  And the field piece  Wid  The languishing eye  Toby  And the howitzer  Wid  The forbidding eye  Toby  And the horn petard  Wid  The imperious eye  Toby  Of all eyes good Heaven defend me from the imperious oneThere are more evils in such an eye widow than in a whole train of artillery      She gives him her hand    O give me Mrs Wadman an eye full of gentle salutations and soft notes whispering like the last low accents of a dying saint  Wid  I see Captain you are acquainted with the soft passions of love as well as the horrors of war  Toby  War Madam What is war But getting together a number of quiet and harmless people with swords in their hands to keep the turbulent and ambitious within boundsIt is one thing to gather laurels it is another to scatter cypress  Wid  Stop CaptainYou are so gallant so ardent I wonder a gentleman of your figure could so long have lived comfortably alone without a bosom to rest your head on or trust your cares to But then that dreadful woundwhere did you receive it Captain  Toby  You shall see Madam the very spot where I    pulls out a plan    Just here Madam before the gate of St Nicholas in one of the traverses of the French opposite to the salient angle of the demi bastion of St RochI suppose you understand the geography of the place
