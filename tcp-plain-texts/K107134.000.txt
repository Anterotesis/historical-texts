 THE BATTLE OF RAMILLIA OR THE Power of Union A POEM  In Five BOOKS  By Mr  DENNIS  LONDON  Printed for  Ben Bragg  at the  Raven  in  PaterNosterRow    To the Right Honourable CHARLES Lord  HALIFAX  My Lord  THIS Poem which was writ with a Design to shew the Prevalence and Power of Union could to no Person be more properly Addrest than Your Lordship who have ever since You have appear'd in the World been so great a promoter of Union  In those great Offices of the highest Trust in which Your Lordship has been employ'd at the same Time both by the Prince and the People You have always made profession of those Publick and Noble Principles which alone are capable of Uniting the Prince and the People  And while in the late Reign the Commons of  England  hearken'd to Your Lordship's Advice in Parliament they were united in their Inclinations and their Designs to the great People whom they represented The Nerves of War were duely supply'd and that War was carried on  Vigorously The Greatness of  France  was sapp'd by degrees and insensibly Undermin'd and prepar'd to receive a terrible Shock from the first Blow it should meet with But as soon as Your Lordship's Enemies began to prevail in those Illustrious Assemblies a Spirit of Parcimony ill Understood and worse Tim'd crept in amongst them and forc'd the best and most discerning of Kings to make a fatal Peace which has endanger'd the Liberties of all  Europe  and the Power and Traffick of this  Kingdom  and has cost this Nation so many Thousands of Lives and so  many Millions of Money and which makes us ev'n at present contented in order to the ending this just and necessary War to furnish those Supplies in the very midst of Scarcity which we then grumbling withheld in the Height of the greatest Affluence  My Lord The late King who was so True and so Just a Judge of Men was so very well convinc'd of Your Lordship's Services both to the Crown and the People that He took care by two just and two grateful Acts that is by calling You up to the House of Peers and making You  Auditor of the Exchequer that Your Country should never want Your Service in Parliament nor the Crown Your Abilities in the great Employments of the State  The extraordinary Regard which so great a King always express'd for Your Lordship's extraordinary Merit provok'd Your Enemies to endeavour to fix on You the odious Name of Favourite as they have since attempted to fasten it on some of Your Illustrious Friends But with how much Malice or how much Ignorance have both Attempts been made For a Favourite is the Prince's meer  Creature whose only Merit is His Sovereign's Favour and such an Object of the Prince's Favour is always that of the Peoples Scorn and Hatred and often exposes the very Sovereign to the same Contempt and Hatred Sovereign Princes are oblig'd by their Duty to God themselves and their People to shew most Regard for those who do most for the good of the People whom They govern And when they perform that Duty ev'n Kings are Justly Honour'd the more for the Merits of their Subjects How Happy is the Nation where the Ministers  of Kings become the Darlings of the People How Happy was  England  during the Time of Your Administration When Your Lordship was united both to the King and the People when the People declar'd aloud by their Representatives in Parliament that You had deserv'd the Honours by which the King distinguish'd You How Happy are we now when the Queen Employs the most extraordinary Persons in the Highest Employments whose Praises are celebrated by the August Assemblies of Parliament and ecchoed by every part of the  Kingdom Since never Princes were more universally esteem'd by the People of  England  than the late King and the present Queen 'tis an Infallible sign that the same People approve of their chosen Ministers  Your Lordship who in the late Reign was constantly employ'd in uniting the King and the People or the People and their Representatives has been justly thought in this to be the fittest Person to maintain Union between the two Sovereign Princes in whom  England  is most concern'd With how sensible a pleasure do all who have the  Honour to know Your Lordship consider the People of  Hanover  surveying You with a venerable Awe as a Person employ'd in Affairs of the Highest Trust and the Highest Consequence by the Two greatest Princes that ever ruled the bravest People of  Europe  The late King made choice of Your Lordship to stand in the Breach which Faction had made in the Ramparts of Liberty The Queen has chosen You not only to resist but to attack Faction and to drive it from its last Retrenchment by settling and securing an intire Correspondence between  Her Majesty and Her presumptive Heir And the Queen could not possibly repose a greater Trust in Your Lordship than by employing You in an Affair the Success of which was of so dear concern to Her Majesty as the securing both the Court of  Hanover  and Her own Subjects of Her hearty Intentions in Relation to the Act of Settlement When that Court beheld in Your Lordship so glorious an Example of the  British  Greatness how were they exalted to think what a People they were one Day to Govern tho' may that be late They began to think  some of their future Subjects equal to Foreign Princes and Your Lordship was entertain'd with the same Honours which are paid to them  The great Things which Your Lordship has done for uniting the Prince and the Successour the Prince and the People and the People among one another and for resisting the Force and Artifices of the Common Enemy ought in gratitude to unite the Inclinations of all  English  Men to Your Lordship To whom we have all so great Obligations that we cannot so much as pay or receive the very least Summ without reflecting  on our Engagements to the late King and to You to the late King whose Image we see upon every single Piece and to Your Lordship who plac'd it there when in the midst of the publick Indigence an Indigence like that of  Tantalus  that plagued us in the midst of Plenty when the Miser rolling in full Bags might then first be truly said to be literally poor Your Lordship by a political and noble Alchymy transmuted Pewter and sordid Brass to Silver and fine Gold and by an Action so great and so beneficent se+cur'd real Property to those  at Home who had but the Shadow of it before and reviv'd and restor'd the expiring Credit of the Nation abroad Since My Lord Treasurer by his admirable Management of the Nerves of War is so justly said to have had so great a share in the glorious Successes of the late Campaigns Your Lordship sure must have no small one since without what you have done there could be no Management  These My Lord are the publick Reasons for Addressing the following Poem to Your Lordship There is a private one and that is that  when a Man contracts so great a Debt as to make him Insolvent the least thing that he can do is to acknowledge what he can never pay thus Bankrupts when they can make no other return send their Creditors an Epistle I have lately had very great Obligations to Your Lordship You have been pleas'd to take some care of my Fortune at a Time when I most wanted it and had least reason to expect it from You since several things hinder'd my giving that constant attendance on You which Persons of Quality so scrupulously exact from those of  Inferiour Rank and with which when Your Lordship is generously pleas'd to Dispense You plainly Declare that Your Noble Notions of Liberty are not embrac'd by You as they are by many either out of Pride or on the account of Interest but by a Principle of Exalted Reason and Goodness and Humanity This is the first Opportunity which I have had since I receiv'd Your Favours of paying my Acknowledgments to You in so publick a manner which I desire Your Lordship to accept with Your usual Goodness But how false or  how bounded is Human Virtue And how few are Grateful without a Design of engaging their Benefactors or others to Heap more Benefits on them by shewing that they can be sensible of them This very Address to Your Lordship is not without an Intention of engaging You whose Judgment in these Matters is acknowledg'd by all the World to defend as far as Your Conscience will give You leave one of the Boldest Poems that has been writ for several Years But I who konw the vast Business in which You are engag'd am presuming  enough to apprehend rather Your not Reading than Your not Liking  I am My Lord Your Lordship's most Humble most Faithful and most oblig'd Servant John Dennis  THE PREFACE  THough the attempt which I have made in the following Poem is very bold yet I would not have the Reader believe it Rash I think my self obliged then to satisfie him without any Delay that it is by no means designed to be a just Epick Poem I know too little of the Nature of that Poem and too much of my own infirmity ever to attempt to write one But tho' this can by no means pass for a just Epick Poem yet is it something of the Epick Kind and bears the same proportion to a just Poem that a short and a faint Essay do's to a full and a perfect Treatise  That which threw me into this way of writing was the very Subject of the Poem The Duke of  Marlborough  has laid such High Obligations upon his Country that nothing can be said too much of him nor done too much for him And this obliged me to endeavour to do something more Bold and more Great than any thing that I had endeavoured to do formerly  But no Poem that is not Religious can be great without extravagance or bold without rashness which has been formerly prov'd But there were but two ways of writing a Religious Poem upon this Occasion The one was to do it by way of Hymn and the other was to introduce Machines The former being anticipated in the Poem which I wrote on the Battle of  Bleinem  there remained only the latter  But here I easily foresee that the following Objection will be made and that is that since what the Duke of  Marlborough  has done is in its self so great and so wonderful what occasion was there to endeavour to adorn it by Fiction To which I answer that because what the Duke of  Marlborough  has done is in its self so wonderful that it appears incredible and Truth it self has the Resemblance of Fable and of Fiction for that very Reason I was encouraged to embellish it with the Ornaments of Poetry This is the Defence that  Boileau  has made for himself in his fourth Epistle for introducing Machines into his Description of the Passage of the  Rhine  And if the Apology stands good for him as it has always past hitherto it is still better for me For my Machines are Christian whereas his are Pagan and consequently can raise no great Emotion in the Minds of the Readers because  they are incredible according to one of his own Verses  L' esprit n'est point emu de ce qu'il ne croit pas  If any one objects that what I make my Machines say and act will no more be believed than what  Boileau  Attributes to the God of the  Rhine  to that I answer that though things did not actually pass before and in the Battle of  Ramillies  as they are related here yet he who believes the Christian Religion and a particular Providence and Reflects upon a hundred Passages in the Old and new Testament must allow that there past something not altogether unlike it We see it is the Opinion of the Duke himself that the Hand of God was in it that Heaven which leaves most Events to common Causes was immediately concerned in this Now can any thing be more reasonable for one who believes that  Heaven was immediately concerned on one side than to believe that Hell which our Religion tells us is always for opposing the great Designs of Heaven was immediately concerned on the other Thus the Design of this Poem is built and the Machines are introduced upon what happened to the Duke in the Battle and what he himself wrote to one of our Ministers of State after it  Thus I have given an Account of the Design of this Poem How well that design is executed I must leave to the Reader As I have consulted my Friends who are fam'd for their Judgment in things of this Nature as to what relates to the first four Books and have had them by me long enough to form some Judgment of them my self I know the Fort and the Foible of them For the fifth I have neither had it by me long enough to make any Judgment of it my self nor have I had time enough to consult my  Friends about it And therefore if there is any thing amiss in it I must leave it to the indulgence of the Candid Reader I only desire him to take notice that having formerly describ'd with all the Application of which I was capable a Battle gain'd by the same General I was obliged to take a very different method in this Poem I have only this to add that I have not said so much as I thought to have done of the Important Consequnces of the Battle of  Ramellies  because I have some thoughts of writing a Pindarick Poem upon that great Action of  Quintus Flaminius  which restored Liberty to the  Grecian  Citties Between which Illustrious  Roman  and the Duke of  Marlborough  a very just Parallel may be drawn  THE BATTLE OF  RAMILLIA  OR THE Power of UNION  LIB I  OF  Belgian  Provinces by Unions Pow'r  Deliver'd in  Ramillia  's Plain I sing  I sing the Triumph of that wondrous Field  Which rais'd the Fame of pious  Anna  's Reign  Above the Glory of great  Henry  's Days  And equall'd  Marlbro  ' to Heroick Chiefs  In Natures Youth and happier Climates born  O Thou whose Wisdom and resistless Pow'r  Has brought to light this wondrous Birth of  Celestial Guardian of this Sacred Isle  Genius of Warlike  Britain  who awhile  Hast left eternal Glory and the Sway  Of some Triumphant Hierarchy of Heav'n  To shelter and protect these happy Realms  Thou who with blissful Charity inspir'd  Infusest Charity thro' ev'ry Heart  And ev'ry Soul subjected to Thy Sway  Teaching Thy much loud  Britons  to subdue  The Rage of  France  and Hell by Love Divine  O dart such Rays of that Seraphick Flame  Into my Breast that all my ravish'd Soul  May with immortal Charity be fir'd  With Sacred Love of  Britain  's Godlike Sons  That rais'd to Heav'n by that Celestial Fire  It may attain a Song of wondrous Height  May take a Flight above th'  Anonian  Hill  And may proclaim thy Wisdom and thy Pow'r  And their Heroick Deeds in such a strain  As no fictitious Muse can ere inspire  Now was the Sun in  Taurus  mounted high  And darting down his Genial Rays from Heav'n  Directly to the Bosom of the Earth  Call'd forth each Plant and ev'ry tender Flow'r  From out their Wintry secret warm Retreats  And restor'd Nature and renew'd the World  When the Confederate Troops call'd out by Fate  And by their great Commanders awful Voice  Were from their wintry warlike Stations drawn  T'appear near  Tongeren  in fierce Array  Full of that conqu'ring Spirit they appear'd  Which drove the vanquish'd  French  or'e  Blenheim  's Field  And in their Eyes a penetrating View  Might easily discern their Triumphs past  And their amazing Victory to come  All Nature seem transported at that Sight  For Tyranny Oppression Discord Fraud  Injustice Violence and Barbarous Rage  Are all about to be expell'd the Earth  And in their room Simplicity and Truth  Justice Security and gentle Ease  And Peace and spotless Innocence shall reign  Therefore all Nature smil'd upon that Sight  And Gods and Men and Earth and Heav'n rejoyc'd  But Hell's black Tyrant soon took fierce Alarms  Which to infernal Torments added Stings  And to infernal Fury fiercer Flames  And doubled the Damnation in his Breast  Upon the Steerage of his dusky Wings  Up thro' the Ocean of the Air he sails  In the midway he stopt between the Moon's  Resplendent Globe and Earth's refulgent Ball  At his great Palace there by Magick hung  And thither a tremendous Council calls  Of Friends who now were roaming round the Earth  In order to subject it to his Sway  Up strait upon the Wing the Spirits sprung  At the  Tartarean  Trumpets thundring call  And high above the Atmosphere they flew  The World was in Convulsions at the Flight  Earth trembled sigh'd the Air the Ocean groan'd  Frequent and full th'accurst Assembly grew  Direful Appearances amazing Forms  Which barely seen had Pow'r to look Despair  And Death into the Hearts of wretched Men  And wither in one moment all their strength  As soon as the Infernal Crew were sate  Up from his Throne th'outragious Tyrant rose  His wrathful Forehead to a Frown he roul'd  That darken'd all the Sky in fixing Plagues  Inexprimable Terrors thro' the Souls  Of his  Tartarean  Ministers that now  With sable Wings their flaming Eyes they veil'd  And they who had th'obdurate Hearts of Fiends  They who to all Hells Horrours were Inur'd  They who eternal Torments could endure  They could not bear their raging Tyrants Wrath  But shook like Men who frightful Fiends behold  Collected in himself a while he stood  But when the horrid Silence had prepar'd  th'accurst Assembly for his dreadful Voice  Thus from his Breast his Rage in Thunder broke▪  Are ye assembled then at my dread Call  By Hell I thought ye durst t'have disobey'd  So light so despicable in your Ears  Has been of late the Tempest of my Voice  But ye not only are assembled here  But what is stranger with those cruel Looks  And that relentless Air with which when last  I met you here you vainly made your Boast  You would subdue the World to my Fell Sway  Would constitute me Universal King  And pull the Thunderer from his noisie Throne  Yes yes ye have the Looks and Meens of Fiends  But O dire Shame to Hell to me to all  Your Deeds are so unworthy the great Name  So Poor so Mean so almost dully Good  That one would swear ye were grown Friends to Men  And Servants to my Rival of the Sky  Can ye be they who made your threatning vaunts  That e'er yon Planet turn'd about the Sun  With that he pointed to Resplendent Earth  As tow'rds the East her Magnitude she rowl'd  It a subjected Province should become  Like these bright Tracts of all surrounding Air  To our black Empire of the boundless Deep  Can it be you who promis'd to or'erturn  The Kingdom there establish'd by Heaven's King  Who there bears Sway wherever Reason rules  Whose Empire is where ever Law commands  For Reason is his secret whispering Voice  And Law his proud Command promulg'd to all  Can it be you who promis'd to extend  My Empire over all yon spotty Globe  An Empire rul'd by Men instead of Laws  Where human Passion sways and human Will  Passion infus'd by us and Will by us  Suggested and insensibly inspir'd  Have ye perform'd what vauntingly ye swore  No tho' your Interest and your Glory both  Demanded it for know Aerial Gods  Where humane Passion reigns and human Will  There we not only Reign but are Ador'd  Of this be sure Religion come from Heaven  Will ne'er support an Empire rais'd by Hell  Nor can the dreadful Empire rais'd by us  Where Tyrant Man instead of Law controuls  Endure Religion that from Heav'n descends  Cast but your Eyes wherever we command  And Man our Proxy reigns instead of Law  There Men adore some vegetable Power  Or their old crazy Priest they make their God  Or madly to Fanatick Prophets fall  There they bow down to Stocks and sensele  Stones  That is to Us and our Delusions bow  And Tremble at the Gods they could create  Why have ye then round Earth supinely roam'd  Regardless of the grand Concern of Hell  Or are your old seducing Arts forgot  Or know ye not my Interests or your own  Cast but your Eyes upon her Silver Globe  As through the vast Abyss of Sky she rouls  See that peculiar People chose by Heaven  To propagate its Empire upon Earth  Which they it seems call Liberty call Law  See how with Hearts too large to be confin'd  Within th'Eternal Fences of the Main  They pass the Limits of the boundless Deep  And every where my Rivals Rule extend  Survey Earths shining Ball with sharpest Ken  What Portion of her Planet can ye find  But where the Glory of the  British  Name  Or of her Councils or her Arms resounds  Look what ev'n now the  Britons  boldly Act  In rough  Germania  in Hesperian Land  In  Celtiberian  and in  Belgian  Fields  Mark yon assembled Squadrons near the  Dyle  Behold the conquering Spirit in their Eyes  Hell ye have suffer'd it to rise so high  'Tis irresistible by human Powers  Unless by our Auxiliar Bands sustain'd  See yonder their accurst Commander comes  And yonder Conquest towring or'e him flies  Whose well known Voice the Goddess strait obey  As at his Master's call the Falcon stoops  And his August Appearance is the Lure  That brings her swiftly rushing from the Skies▪  If once he joyns those Squadrons we are lost  His high Appearance when they once behold  Hell can shew nought so Dreadful and so Dire  As can dismay the greatness of their Souls  Ye Hosts of Terrors ye remember well  That when our fierce Auxiliar Bands sustain'd  Our dear Allies in  Blenheim  's deathless Field  The  Britons  though to every human Power  Invincible were forc'd to yield to Ours  But when great  Marlborough  came impetu  on  And rallied them with that Heroick Air  With which he fires the Warlike Squadro  Souls  Ye Stygian Gods what Miracles we saw  How they who Trembled but the Moment past  Before the King of Terror's awful view  Now fought like Gods above the reach of Fate  His Godlike Presence in a Moment rais'd  Their sinking Spirits and dispell'd their Fears  His Voice his sole Appearance made them bold  With what resistless Fury they prest on  Drove you with matchless Bravery on our Friends  Tho' I look'd on and tho' I menac'd high  But all my clamour was in Thunder drown'd  Till  French  and Fiends together vanish'd all  And Howling sunk thro'  Danube  's Ghastful yawn  Down to our Empire of the Nether Deep  Ye know ye Stygian Gods and oft have read  Within the Adamantine Book of Fate  That more amazing Wonders are reserv'd  To be perform'd by  Marlborough  's conquering Arm  Unless with all our Power we interpose  Lewis  by me and Destiny design'd  T'extend my Empire and exalt my Name  Above all Names that are ador'd on Earth  Lewis  the Great the Wise the second Hope  Hell  The Man the Monarch after my own Heart  Who never yet transgrest my dread Com+mands  But makes them his Employment all the Day  And Meditation all the watchful Night  He the great Image of my self express  Presumptuous Fraudulent Revengeful Prou  Implacable Inexorable False  Ev'n greatly and heroically False  Who watchful as a roaring Lion roams  With Jaws expanded to devour his Prey  And makes Religion his Pretence for Fraud  For Cruelty for dire Revenge for Murder  And every noble every slagrant Vice  O way to banish Virtue from the World  O great Invention envied ev'n by me  His Genius now from  Marlborough  's Genius shrinks  And unless we support him he must fall  And can we then forsake th'Immortal Man  Ah no such Merit claims that at his Need  To guard him from our fierce insulting Foes  We raise the noble Arrierban of Hell  If  Lewis  falls our Empire with him sinks  We meet a second more opprobrious Fall  For ev'n from Earth for ev'n from Dust we fall  O shameful Fall for us who aspir'd to Heaven  For us who made Divinity our Aim  Then Law and Reason will victorious reign  Then Liberty eternal will become  Then odious Virtue will possess the Earth  And every glorious Vice be driv'n to Hell  Exert your selves ye Furies then and act  Deeds worthy the Antagonists of Heaven  Can ye forget what utterly forget  What once we acted and what once we were  Ah no ye never can for in your Breasts  Some Spirits unextinguish'd yet remain  Some of those Godlike Spirits that inspir'd  Our Angel minds in that Eternal Field  When girt with Adamant and glorious Flames▪  Against the Empire of great Heaven we fought▪  I must confess we lost th'Immortal Day  But yet we fought ye Stygian Gods we fought  With Spirit equal to the vast Design  Fate gave our Enemy the Field but Ours  Ours was the Triumph and the Glory Ours  Of great aspiring unexampled Minds  Who dar'd against the Omnipotent to War  Can ye remember this Can ye reflect  That ye for Angels were an equal Match  And yield at last to Man to Woman yield  For 'tis a Woman O ye Pow'rs destroys  This mighty Champion of our Cause and Us  For she directs she animates she fires  Those who o're Earth the Rule of Heav'n extend▪  'Tis she who out of pure Despight to me  Contemns a boundless Arbitrary Reign  And thinks it lovelier Empire fairer Fame  Upon my Rival poorly to depend  Poorly to wear a Crown that Law may Rule  And to make Reason and th'Almighty Reign  Than be her self a Soveraign Goddess own'd  And by the Kingdoms of the Earth ador'd  Had ye the Spirit with which once ye flam'd▪  There needed not this long and pow'rful Speech  The Godlike Cause in which ye stand engag'd  The Cause of Empire and Eternal Fame  Would move alone your Adamantine Hearts  And urge you to great Acts tho' I were Mute▪  Behold yon World that fluctuates in the void  Know that's the Victor's Recompense Decreed▪  Now see your Female Adversary there  See her a Suppliant Earnest Humble Meek  Behold her Prostrate Abject on her Knees  And Trembling at that Monarch of the Sky  Whom so magnanimously we defy  No ye can ne're see this and not disdain  That she should make that floating World a Heav'n  Which we so greatly strive to make a Hell  Thus he blasphem'd aloud and while he spoke  Th'Assembly all the several movements felt  The various Passions that their direful King  Who knew so well their Hearts design'd t'Inspire  Now pleas'd now sad now trembling now enrag'd  With Envy wrack'd or burning with disdain  Or with desire of fierce Revenge inflam'd  When he had done unanimous they rent  The troubled  Aether  with a stormy Shout  And to the Heaven of Heavens defiance hurl'd  When suddenly a burst of Thunder broke  From the Empyrean and th'avenging Bolt  Thro' thousands drives and thousands lightning Blasts  Then as a flock of  imerous Fowl takes Wing  And seeks the inmost Covert of the Grove  On hearing of the Fowler's fatal Gun  That had of old their tender pinions gall'd  So on the Wing th'infernal Angels sprung  Upon the Empyrean Thunders roar  And sought the midmost Regions of the Air  And the black Hemisphere and Realms of Night  But soon their impious daring they resum'd  And up once more to the pure  Aether  slew  Among the rest there was a fantom Dire  Of all that fell from Heav'n the fiercest Fiend  The fiercest and most cruel Fiend that fell  Discord the Daughter of dire  Lucifer    Begot when his prodigious Lust ran high  On Pride when with her hottest Flames she burn'd  Gigantick was her Stature and her Looks  Like  Demogorgon  's  ere at which Hell shakes  Her Native Country was the Heav'n of Heav'ns  But Heav'n as soon as born disclaim'd the Fiend  With Lightnings and with Thunders drove her out  For Happiness still fl  es the raving Fiend  And Peace and Joy with her can never dwell  As from her Birth she was expell'd from Heaven  So by her cruel Father's dire Decree  She banish'd was from all the Bounds of Hell  As one who might elsewhere far better serve  The growing Empire of her dreadful Sire  But at her parting half her Serpent Brood  She left behind and to the very Heart  Her own inexorable Father stung  That with the Torment ever since he roars  Thus banish'd from high Heaven and driv'n from Hell  She among miserable Mortals dwells  A false and most inhospitable Guest  Who all her warmest Friends torments the most  Tho' banish'd from her Father's Realms below  Yet not one Fiend of all th'infernal Host  Endeavours to extend with so much Zeal  The spreading Empire of Hell's horrid sway  To others or her self no Rest sh' allows  Alternately afflicted with th'Extreams  Of burning Fury and tormenting Fear  And sharp Remorse with all her deadliest Stings  Arm'd all the Fears and Furies of her Soul  To this infernal Council she was call'd  And when the Whirlwind of Applause was o're  Up rose the Subtle and the Cruel Fiend  As rising her  Gorgonian  Head she shook  With all its Snakes that from their livid Eyes  Shot Hell's blue Fire and from their baleful Mouths  Darted a Thousand forky poisnous Tongues  A thousand Hisses at th'Assembly threw  Each frighted Spectre gave a fearful Start  As a poor Swain that underneath his Feet  Spies a fell Adder bloated with his Rage  And lifting up his angry Crest on high  Springs back while to his Heart his Blood retire▪  And none but  Lucifer  himself had Pow'r  To cast one look npon the raging Fiend  And he himself grew Stupid at the sight  Like old  Laoeoon  's dismal Statue look'd  That seems not fashion'd by the Sculptor's Art  But shews a Wretch with Horror stupid grown  And petrified with Woe and with Despair  And as the hideous Hag began to Scream  Th'accurst Assembly gave a second Start  Th'accurst Assembly gave a dreadful Yell  With equal fright shall all th'Infernal Host  And equal Horror hear at the last Day  The sounding clangour of th'Eternal Trump  Which universal Nature shall untune  And the bad Angels roaring drive to Hell  Then bar the Gates with Adamantine Bolts  Which then shall to Eternity be clos'd  Such was her Air unutterably dire  And such her hideous Voice and thus she spoke  Have we the Patience then of stupid Saints  Ye Gods to hear all this without Reply  Nay our insulting Tyrant to applaud  For his unjust and barbarous Reproach  But this tho' spoke to all is meant to me  For without me not all the Host of Hell  Has pow'r t'enlarge its dreadful Monarch's sway  Am I of want of Knowledge then accus'd  Or want of Diligence t'extend thy Pow'r  O burning Indignation O Disdain  O slander worthy of dire  Lucifer    And darst thou thus accuse me falsly here  Upon this Throne of thy Imperial Pow'r  Encompass'd with ten Thousand Spirits round  By mighty Angels serv'd and ev'n by me  From whence is all this Pomp this Pow'r deriv'd  This Emulation of the Thunderers State  Before I knew thee what wert thou in Heav'n  A servile Ministrel bred to Cringe and Fawn  And flatter thy proud Arbitrary Lord  But I an Emperor made thee of a Slave  Of a base Flatterer a Blasphemer bold  The Rival and the Antagonist of him  Whom thou so slavishly obey'dst before  Millions of Angels to thy side I drew  I gave them Spirit to assert thy Cause  Against thy thundring Rival and his Slaves  In that eternal Day which tho' we lost  We triumph'd in defeat O matchless Fame  For we dissolv'd his universal Sway  An Empire by our overthrow we gain'd  And thou a poor precarious Lord before  Becam'st the independant King of Hell  I founded thy Dominion upon Earth  I propagate in humane Hearts thy Sway  For where I dwell not thou canst never reign  No there dull Union dwells there lazy Peace  And Reason and thy hated Rivals Law  Have I not  Lewis  now for fifty Years  Inspir'd possessing all his mighty Soul  I fir'd that Soul to all those vast Designs  That made it worthy thee and worthy me  His sanguinary Orders I inspir'd  And then perform'd them with this Bloody hand  And all the  European  World laid bare  'Twas I embru'd his fierce dragooning Slaves  In Fathers and in Brothers guiltless Blood  A Sea of guiltless Blood this Hand has spilt  Thy Rival's Images by Millions I  In Rancour to th'Original defac'd  That thou might'st Triumph o're the vanquish'd World  And  Lewis  might thy great Vicegerent Reign  If now he flies before victorious  Anne    Can I with Justice be condemn'd or blam'd  Think'st thou 'tis to the Woman that I yield  No 'tis to him from whom thou fledst amain  With this Assembly here of potent Gods  And all the great th'united Host of Hell  'Tis to that Wisdom and that Power Divine  Which Day and Night on that victorious Queen  As on the conquering Hierarchies attends  Is it my Fault if that Religious Queen  By ev'ry Action and by ev'ry Voice  Inspires her  Britons  with Celestial Love  If by thy Rival she is taught t'employ  Great Souls by him and Destiny design'd  And by profoundest depths of Reason fit  T'unite her Subjects first and then Mankind  Am I to be condemn'd if while Abroad  Great  Marlborough  in indissoluble Bonds  The thwarting Interests of the Nations joyns  At Home  Godolphin  temperates the rage  Of Factions which for Mastery contend  And makes Confusion which is weakness yield  To Order which is Strength as he Above  The Rage of warring Atoms reconcil'd  Or causing them t'engage with moderate Strife  Yet Strife where that prevails which most agrees  With those eternal Laws that Rule the Whole  Mingled the Elements and made the World  I freely own that those our Mortal Foes  Grow more pernicious to us every Hour  They are come t'Associate now with  William  's Friends  William  whose Name we Fiends with Horror hear  Ev'n with his firmest faithfullest Friends they advise  Who never shrunk from his detested side  Tho' with a thousand Dangers compast round  By homebred Traytors and by foreign Foes  Th'audacious Men who insolently dar'd  To set up Liberty and pull down us  When  France  and Hell reign'd Paramount on Earth  When they had nought but Ruine to expect  From such a cursed desperate Attempt  With these they now consult in these confide  And these victorious  Anne  delights t'employ  To  Spain  she  Mordant  and  Ravigni  sends  And  Montague  himself to  German  Plains  Is hurried in extream despight to me  Where his wise Councils and his pow'rful Voice  Threaten my very Being to destroy  And menace all this dreadful Host in me  Therefore unless we make one last Effort  One great Attempt that's worthy of my Rage  Britain  Farewel and Tyranny Adieu  Adieu the Reign of Hell's despotick Sway  Britain  Unanimous as well as Free  Will soon Enfranchise and Unite the World  But not the pow'rfullest Fiend of all that fell  From Heav'n of all that own thy boundless Sway  Dares make that horrible Attempt but I  And now ev'n now I form the glorious Plan  As the Confederates by uniting Thrive  Success continuing will Cement them more  But their Felicity to come depends  Upon yon Squadrons in the  Belgian  Plains  Should they th'adverse Event of Battle feel  All that Great  Anne  has done t'unite Mankind  I can with Ease in one Campaign o'rethrow  Yon Squadrons I have view'd and have review'd  With all the Inquisition of my Eyes  I view'd them and I sigh'd to find their Heads  And Hearts united by great  Marlborough  's Care  Which makes them the just Terror of us all  But here by Hell and all Hell's Pow'rs I swear  Hear it ye God's who rule the unbounded Air  Hear it ye Horrors of th'Abiss profound  Ye black Attendants on Eternal Night  Hear it ye Deities assembled here  In Council to maintain Hell's horrid Sway  And thou whom all these dreadful Pow'rs obey▪  Whose Frown makes Gods above and God below  And all the frighted Universe except  The stedfast Empyraean Tremble Hear  Hear me great  Lucifer  while by thy self  Thy dire inviolable self I swear  That I with Spirit great as the Design  Great as the glorious Cause and worthy me  I that audacious General will destroy  I those victorious Squadrons will o'rethrow  And still in spight of Earth in spight of Heav'n  Discord and  Lucifer  and Hell shall reign  She said and not expecting a Reply  Down tow'rds the Earth she wheel'd her airy Flight  And  Lucifer  dismiss'd th'Infernal Pow'rs  The End of the First Book  THE BATTLE OF  RAMILLIA  OR THE Power of UNION  LIB II  NOW in the midmost Region of the Air  Descending Discord meets the Beldame Night  As Westward she her Sable Chariot drives  Old Night the Fury places by her side  And her black shaggy Mantle o'r her throws  As Discord sat by the dark grizly Hag  Discord more hideous seem'd and Night more foul  As they were hurried by their coal black Steeds  And the soft Chariot slid thro' Midnight Air  A motley Equipage before behind  And on each side the Journeying Furies flew  For there flew Treason with her looks askew  And Subornation clad in dismal Black  And  Stygian  Envy of a livid Hue  And yellow Jealousy with Eyes suffus'd  And faithless Fraud in particolour'd Robe  And Murder pale distain'd with sanguine Dye  And ugly Slander speckled like a Toad  With livid Spots upon a saffron Hue  Over her Arms her Belly and her Thighs  But Serpentine her Head and deadly Eyes  And from her Mouth she hurl'd her forky Tongue  And hideous was her Hiss and mortal was her Sting  Then lame Adultery and Incest blind  And sly Hypocrisy with Holy Leer  Came lagging in the Rear with Reverend Gown  And darting many a sow'r Grimace he flew  And sigh'd profoundly with inverted Eyes  And bang'd his Stomacher with sounding Strokes  But all affected was and all was false  For nervous were his Limbs and bold his Brow  His dimpled Cheek was of Vermilion Dye  His Chin a Fabrick with two Stories built  His wanton Eyeballs sparkled as they roll'd  His pamper'd side was with a sevenfold Shield  Defended of impenetrable Brawn  His Paunch was prominent above the rest  And like a goodly Promontory hung  The Silver Moon above th'Horizon peep'd  And frighted at the monstrous Scene retir'd  The conscious Stars withdrew their sickning fires  And Nature that abhorr'd the dismal sight  Redoubled all the Terrors of the Dark  As o're  Campania  's Viney Downs they flew  The Centinels of Nature took the Alarm  The watchful Dogs in ev'ry Village bay'd  And hungry Wolves forsook their Prey to Howl▪  And the wing'd Prophets of Nocturnal Sky  The fatal Raven croak'd the ghastful ScriechOwl scream'd  When to the glittering Palace they approach'd  Where  Lewis  in a restless slumber lay  Upon th'uneasy Down from the black Carr  Discord alights the golden Turrets shook  The Doors flew open with a hollow Groan  And the Fiend enter'd where the Tyrant lay  Then throws off her immense Gigantick Form  And the Gorgonian Terrors of her Front  And  Maintenon  appears in Shape and Air  And she who a fall'n Angel was before  Is a decay'd affected Beauty now  When she the Royal Curtains drew she saw  The Tyrant tossing on the restless Plume  Haughty and Stern and thoughtful ev'n in Sleep  Revolving mighty Mischiefs in his Mind  His Forehead furrow'd by an angry Frown  And on his clouded Brow sate cruel Care  And now and then he gave a fearful Start  And from his Heart drew many a guilty Groan  Ev'n Discord gaz'd with Pleasure at that sight  And the Fiend smil'd that never smil'd before  And canst thou Sleep in this malignant Hour  Said she when ev'ry Star's against thee leagu'd  How fall'n how chang'd from that transcendant State  In which the gazing World admir'd thee once  When thou wert grown the Terror ev'n of Kings  And dreadful Scourge of the Worlds potent Lords  When thou the Earth so rapidly laid'st waste  That Victory came panting in thy Rear  And wanted Wings t'o'rtake thy impetuous March▪  When Emulous of the Meridian Sun  Thy Glory blaz'd and thou had'st Hope to shine  Sole Monarch of the desolated Earth  As he sole Tyrant of the desart Sky  Yet in those Happy in those glorious Days  No profound Sleep could ever lull thy Soul  And rarely rarely Slumber clos'd thy Eyes  But all the Day and all the live long Night  Care kept thee watching to inflame the World  And to divide and to destroy Mankind  Now by victorious  Marlborough  brought low  Here thou liest buried in inglorious Ease  While with unwearied Vigilance he wakes  And ev'n this now the vollied Thunder grasps  That is about to part with hideous Roar  And all thy trembling Provinces amaze  Strike forty Thousand of thy Veterans dead  Strike ev'n thee dead their Arbitrary Lord  And with thy Person kill thy very Fame  Unless this Moment thou prevent'st the Blow  What fatal Hour is lost in soft Repose  Has adverse Fortune cool'd thy tow'ring Pride  Or has Age quench'd thy noble Lust of Soul  And that aspiring Flame that rais'd thy Thoughts  To Affectation ev'n of Godhead once  Can he who aim'd erewhile at nothing less  Than reigning King of Kings and Lord of Lords  Can he a Rival bear in Empire now  And art thou to a poor Despondence grown  Of Lording it o'r all this Western World  Yet hast thou Reason to despond indeed  Unless thou art eternally Intent  To disunite whom thou pretend'st t'o'rthrow  The few Gigantick Hunters of Mankind  Who universal Empire here acquir'd  All of them vast Advantages enjoy'd  Which Heav'n and Nature have deny'd to thee▪  Cyrus  great  Caesar  and the Son of  Jove    Young  Hammon  led their conqu'ring Troops themselves  Were themselves brave sometimes to Rashness Brave  And the undaunted Squadrons which they led  When they were Conquerors were always free▪  And could a more exalted Virtue boast  Than those who yielded to their conqu'ring Arms  But here Thou li'st supinely at Thy Ease  And buried in opprobrious Sloath pretend'st  To do thy Work by Journey men of War  Yes by Thy baffled Mareschals Thou pretend'st  Day Labourers who for Thy Glory drudge  To conquer Heroes fighting for their own  Fierce Warlike People Thou pretend'st t'o'rcome  By the Inhabitants of soft  Anjou    Or Squadrons in delicious  Touraine  bred  And by dejected and desponding Slaves  Freeborn magnanimous Nations to o'rthrow  But Freemen ne're were vanquish'd yet by Slaves  Nor Warlike Nations by a wanton Crew  If in thy great Designs Thou would'st succeed  Divide those Foes and fight them with themselves  Then by each others Arms enslave them all  And what Thou want'st in Personal Command  Or Valour or the Hardness of Thy Troops  Supply by Fraud and old notorious Arts  But take Occasion by the Forelock still  And let no Minute pass no Moment slip  That may be employ'd to disunite their Force  And by dividing to confound their Pow'r  Such an important Moment is This now  In which Thou liest dissolv'd in fatal Sleep  The Reins of Empire yielding up to Chance  And dead and stupid to the Charms of Fame  But tho' thou slumber'st know I always wake  And Day and Night or'e thy dear Interest brood▪  To cherish it like tender Birds their Young  And now am come thou dearest of Mankind  Dearer than Pleasure to me dear as Pride  Dear as the Godlike Pleasure of Revenge  Am come to rouze Thee from thy inglorious Ease  And my own Empire to advance in Thine  True said the Tyrant who had all this while  Been shaking off the Downey Bands of Sleep  If that a strong Desire to Rule the World  Inspires and Agitates my Highborn Soul  'Tis but to lay it at thy Lovelier Feet  And that the Ruler of the Land and Main  May be a happier Slave and worthier Thee  And let the boundless Liberty you take  Which had been Death to any one but Thee  Declare the Boundless Pow'r thy wondrous Charms  Have given Thee o're ev'n my ambitious Soul  But why do'st Thou who hast the Pow'r to pierce  The intimat'st Recesses of my Heart  Who rul'st it with as Arbitary Sway  As I my self would all the World controul  So cruelly upbraid me without Cause  Canst thou believe I poorly have giv'n o're  My great Design of Universal Sway  Canst Thou believe I lie extended here  Out of a low inglorious Indolence  Or mean Despondence of Success which ne  Can seize a towring fiery Soul like mine  No never shall my Soul Abatement feel  Of its high Passion for eternal Fame  But as I Thee adore with fiercer Flame  Than all that in my warmest Youth I felt  Ev'n for the brightest of Thy charming Sex  For  Montespan  or lovely  La Fontange    Or tender  La Valiere  so Age it self  Does but augment my noble Lust of Fame  'Tis my first Principle of Life by which  I speak and move and act and think and am▪  And  Lewis  when that fails must be no more  O could I but the Weaknesses suppress  Of this frail Flesh and conquer the Desire  And Need of Nutriment and soft Repose  As I th'Infirmities have overcome  Of my great Mind extinguishing Remorse  Driving Compassion out and stifling Shame  Then without Interval the glorious Cares  Of Empire should employ my Aspiring Soul  Under which now sometimes my Nature sinks  And I by sordid Elements are forc'd  To feed the thinking Parts expiring Flame  And seek new Life within the Arms of Death▪  But soon I shake off his dull Chains and then  At once to Life and Glory I return  Whether 'twas partial Destiny or Chance  That gave Victorious  Marlborough  the Day  In a dire Hour at  Bleinem  's fatal Field  O fatal Field to all my Aspiring Thoughts  I will forget that ever Thou hast been  And think of Universal Sway again  Yet to the Terror of my wondring Foes  I still recover'd that amazing Blow  Renew'd the fainting Courage of Troops  My Loss recruited and retriev'd my Pow'r  Me canst Thou then of Indolence accuse  Or of Despondence or abated Fire  Me whose unwearied Care has since opprest  The Dilatory  Germans  on the  Rhine    Opprest them on  Verona  's wondring Stream  And oblig'd Fortune in her own Despight  Against her worthless Favourites to declare  O I had laid a Scheme which would have sunk  And utterly confounded all my Foes  If Fate in Tempests had not interpos'd  Upon th'  Adige  and the  Rhine  I fought  Only with Men and there I found Success  In  Spain  I was constrain'd to yield to Heav'n  For 'twas the loud Artillery of Heav'n  That from me snatch'd the Celtiberian Tow'r  And baffled my whole Providence at once  But whence can this transporting Fury Spring  Or what makes this the great deciding Hour  To whom the Fury eagerly reply'd  By that disastrous Disappointment  Spain    The Pride for which contending Nations fight  Depends upon this very fatal Hour  Which here Thou squander'st in inglorious Ease  Spain  is in utmost Danger to be lost  Unless Thou rousing wilt prevent the Blow  And  Spain  in Danger will deject our Friends  And give more daring Spirit to our Foes  And bind them in indissoluble Bonds  Consider how they all prepare t'Unite  England  and  Scotland  stretch their Sinewey Arms  Both eager in a strict Embrace to meet  And for the future like two Sisters live  By their great Mother's Wisdoms reconcil'd  In  England  too by wise  Godolphin  's Care  Faction has lost its Ferment and grows mild  The very Tygress Faction is grown tame  The Listless  Germans  whom thy wondrous Arts  So nobly have divided and brought low  Some lucid Intervals of Concord find  And publick Spirit and Will surely leave  Their shameful Quarrels and opprobrious Sloath  If  Spain  should from thy baffled Arms be torn  That Loss will calm the fierce  Hungarian  's Rage  And Spirit jealous  Venice  to declare  Against th'Invader of fair  Italy  If  Spain  the Golden Prize of Battles lost  No Stratagem nor Violence nor Art  Can thy exhausted Treasury Supply  And then thy numerous Armies vanish all  And leave Thee to the Scorn of thy proud Foes  Even thy own Slaves and that's the Blow of Fate  Ev'n thy own vile obsequious Slaves will rise  And take rebellious Arms against their King  Then from the  Pyrenaeans  to the  Rhine  Adieu Thy Conquests and perhaps Thy Crown  But nought assure thy self can  Spain  retrieve  But a surprizing and stupendous Blow  Struck suddenly upon the  Belgian Dyle  A sudden and surprizing Blow struck there  While this the great Campaign of Fate be+gins  Will give thee sure occasion to detach  Part of thy conqu'ring Troops to  Philip  's Aid  To push thy Advantage on th'astonish'd  Rhine    Thy Friend the lost Elector to restore  And penetrate to inmost  Austria  's Clime  Which then in vain shall wait great  Marlborough  's Aid  That will constrain the Empire to recal  The new Supplies to Illustrious  Eugene  sent  And give thee time to finish  Savoy  's Fate  That fatal Blow will once again divide  Confederated Pow'rs will  Venice  awe  Exasperate the fierce  Pannonian  Mars  Amaze the  Germans  and the  Dutch  confound  Prevent that Union now design'd between  The  English  and the  Caledonian  States  And in both Realms rekindle factious Rage  Rouze up thy sleeping Arbitrary Friends  Ferment them still with more fanatick Rage  That our declining Empire will sustain  And will advance thro' all the Christian World  And wipe away the Stains of  Bleinem  's shameful Day  To whom the grizly Tyrant thus reply'd  O why hast thou once more so rashly rouz'd  The Serpent slumbring in my wounded Breast  Which when awake still gnaws my mangled Head▪  And greedily devours my vital Blood  O  Bleinem  bane to my aspiring Thoughts  At whose Idea all come tumbling from their Height  Bleinem  the Hag that in the dead of Night  My Fancy rides and drives soft Sleep away  The very Tyrant of my ambitious Soul  Blast to my Hopes of Universal Sway  Which wither ail and die when thou appear'st  And only by forgetting thee Revive  'Twas there by such a rash presumptuous Fight  As what thou now provok'st me to Repeat  That forty Thousand of my conqu'ring Troops  That always conquer'd till that cursed Hour  Were like ripe Corn in Autumn mow'd in Heaps  Those Heaps in Ranks extended on the Plain  Too plenteous Harvest of that bloody Field  Which broke the Hearts and Spirits of the rest  And interrupted all my vast Designs  Made all my Friends despond my Foes insult  And laid my Weakness open to the World  For as my greatness and my awful Pow'r  Lay in Opinion more than real Strength  Th'Opinion which the Nations had conceiv'd  Fortune was grown Immutable as Fate  And always would attend my conqu'ring Arms  That fatal Days Calamities Event  Undeceiv'd all the Christian World at once  And made me grow the very Scorn of those  To whom I was most Terrible before  Me would'st thou have repeat the dangerous risk  Of Battle when thou hast thy self observ'd  That to subdue I must divide my Foes  And then enslave them by each others Arms  That warlike Nations ne'r were Vanquish'd yet  By softer Ones nor Free born Souls by Slaves  Know'st thou not then that to divide my Foes  I must remain not only without Fight  But without War O Gods for that blest Hour  One short liv'd Truce would more advance my Fame  And spread my Empire than ten Victories▪  He said and thus the subtle Fiend reply'd  True if Fallacious Truce thou could'st obtain  I before Victory would Truce advise  But since thy Foes have been so oft betray'd  And mock'd all Hope of faithless Peace in vain  Therefore the Mischief ill Success has done  Must be by sudden Victory repair'd  Nor need'st thou run a dangerous risk to o'recome  What lost the fatal Day at  Blenheim  's Field  What but Presumption grown from long Success  Which  aus'd thee to abandon thy old Arts  And vainly to rely on fanci'd Power  Because Aetheral Victory had oft  Perch'd on thy waving Streamers when thy Troops  By odds of Numbers overwhelm'd their Foes  By long Success grown insolently vain  Thou fondly thought'st t'o'recome on equal Terms  Unknowing of the Troops thou wert t'engage  And wondrous Merit of their matchless Chief  Hence the Disaster of that Fatal Day  But when to your old Methods you return'd  With them Success and Victory return'd  For the prevented  Germans  you surpriz'd  Upon th'  Adige  and th'astonish'd  Rhine    And both their Armies easily o'rethrew  Both by superior Numbers overwhelm'd  And in their Leaders Absence both opprest  Ruine th'Allies upon the  Belgian  Plains  Opprest by the same Odds before their Chiefs  Arrive before their various Pow'rs are join'd  Then with Success return to thy old Arts  And by Division break their potent League  Thy Orders strait to the  Bavarian  send  Thy numerous  Belgian  Garrisons to drain  And swell thy Troops assembling on the  Dyle    Then as a Torrent to a Deluge swell'd  Disdains its Banks and makes its roaring way  With dreadful Devastation so may they  Scorning their Lines o'reflow th'adjacent Plains▪  While Desolation marks their hideous Course  And the surpriz'd Confederate Forces leave  The same eternal Monument of Pow'r  Which at  Morat  the fam'd  Burgundians  left  But Rouze lay hold upon this fatal Hour  Think that the very next may be too late  This Hour great  Marlborough  for his Camp sets forth  Whom thou must still industriously avoid  Avoiding  Marlborough    Lewis  may be Great  Thou hast already felt his nervous Arm  Whose towring Genius all the  Genii  dares  Of thy weak Marshals which before it Cow'r  He the great Qualities alone enjoys  Of all thy Chiefs who are and who have been  Great  Conde  's Spirit and his wondrous Fire  Joyn'd with that Presence of commanding Soul  That keeps intirely Master of it self  And Master of the furious God of War  When with dire Looks and with a dreadful Roar  He Foams and all the God runs mad with Rage  Great  Marlborough  has  Luxemburgh  's dispatch  His subtle Turns and his sagacious Views  The Wisdom and Sedateness of  Turenne    His dauntless Valour with his Thought profound  And vast Capacity and all that Skill  So admirable in the Art of Death  Which fix'd th'inconstancy of Fortunes Will  And made her doat on Wisdom's Charms divine  Rouze thy self then beware that fatal Man  Issue thy dread Commands this Moment out  And let the great deciding Blow be given  E'r Destiny and  Marlborough  arrive  The Fury said the Tyrant gave Consent  To the  Bavarian  strait his Orders sends  His numerous  Belgian  Garrisons to drain  And swell his Troops assembling on the  Dyle    Which to the Army thro the dreary Shades  Thence to the various Towns the impetuous Daemon bore  The End of the Second Book  THE BATTLE OF  RAMILLIA  OR THE

The starry Host of Heav'n and Host of Hell  And still the wakeful Dog took soft Repose  And still the prouling Wolf persu'd his Prey  No Shepherds Pipe was on the Mountains heard  Nor Hunters Bugle in the Ecchoing Vales  When the shrill Trumpet rouz'd up drowsy  Mars    Death's Bugle in the Chase of Humane Blood  The Beasts of Nature to their Dens retir'd  And the whole Forrest trembled at the sound  The Beasts of Nature fear'd alas in vain▪  Tho' Fate a solemn Hunting had prepar'd  For Man the Huntsman was and Man the Prey  Before the Dawn throughout the  Belgian  Plains  The Garrisons

Gallick  Pow'r  Whence now this Spirit this Superiour Fire  From Liberty the Mareschal strait replys  'Tis from the Bravery of the  English  Troops  Who with Immortal Liberty inspir'd  And with the Love of Glory all inflam'd  Infect the Nations with Their noble Fire  As Man was form'd to Lord it over Beasts  Freemen were preordain'd to vanquish Slaves▪  And this th'event had shewn in  William  's Reig  Had but His honest Mind suspected Thee  To whom the Fury instantly reply'd  'Tis true the  English  merit all our Praise  A Nation Fierce Magnanimous and Free  Valiant from Freedom from their Clima  Brave  Who in their fierce Attacks with Fury made  And in their firmness to sustain the Efforts  Of their outragious and their pressing Foes  Equal the Warlik'st Nations of the World  But in their Rallying Rage surpass them all  Your  Gallick  Troops with Fury know t'assault  But never yet endur'd the fierce Attacks  Of their bold Foes when obstinately urg'd  Our  Germans  with much Constancy sustain  But when our Squadrons once are broke they'r lost  The  English  Rally still with greater Rage  Than they at first attack th'astonish'd Foe  While with their eager Shouts the  Welkin  rings  As a fierce Bull who furiously contends  For the fair She that has his Heart subdu'd  And for the Empire of the Flow'ry Meads  Recedes from his proud Rival to return  With more impetuous Shock more dreadful Rage  While with His clash the ecchoing Vale resounds  So when the  Britons  from the Field retreat  They rally with no less amazing Fire  But the great Changes of the World below  Are brought about by Heav'n and not by Man  For 'tis a Jealous God who rules the Sky  Jealous of Glory and in Love with Praise  And when the Wonders of his Might He shews  And brings to pass astonishing Events  Events which all the under World amaze  'Tis not by Strength of Nations that He works  For that would look meer Human Might to all  But by select Celestial Spirits sent  For that Design from His own Heav'n and form'd  Of finer Clay and in a nobler Mould  Than are the vulgar Race of Mortal Men  And animated with Diviner Fire  That when to all th'astonish'd World they appear  With more than Human Qualities endued  Th'astonish'd World may be constrain'd to own  And they themselves confess that what they do  Is by th'immediate Hand of Heav'n perform'd  The noblest Nations have deriv'd their Fame  And all their Greatness from the Godlike few  And when These fail them they are lost undone  And grow the Scorn of their Insulting Foes  Or are quite swallow'd in

Religion and their  Anne    She Freedom and the Might of  Malb'rough  gave▪  As  William  was betray'd undone by me  Mareschal by us great  Malborough  too must fall▪  On which depends to morrow's fatal Day  For from His Presence yon audacious Troops  Derive the dauntless Spirit in their Eyes  From which they flash intollerable Fire  Ev'n thou thy self for I remark'd it well  Thou wert agreeably surpriz'd and rais'd  When his August Appearance thou beheld'st  Worthy the Grandeur of th'immortal Mind  Commanding as the Form of the first Man  While His great Maker's Image He retain'd  And Empire sate upon his Lordly Brow  The World's Imperial Ruler and his own  Before Celestial Reason had been taught  Her Subject Passion poorly to obey  And the degenerating Mind debas'd  The Majesty and Empire of the Meen  When e're His Troops behold that noble Form  All His great Actions all His high Exploits  Present themselves before their wondring Minds  Gelderland  conquer'd with its warlike Towns▪  And  Liege  and  Limbourgh  as by Magick rise  And to their view present their stately Tow'rs  Dire  Schellenbourg  's impenetrable Fort  Carried against the Choice of all our Pow'rs  And  Bleinem  's everlasting Day appears  And stunns with Rapture their astonish'd Minds  The Trumpet with its Clangour tears their Ears  And then they charge and once again they fight  Their Battles o're and triumph once again  And then the World wants force t'oppose their Pow'r  Whom to defeat we  Malborough  must destroy  For firmly yon audacious Troops believe  'Tis not from Fortune these Successes flow  But from the Wisdom of their wondrous Chief  His vast Capacity his flaming Zeal  His restless Labour and perpetual Thought  His dreadless Spirit and His just Designs  Indeed so just have been His great Designs  So exquisite His Conduct so profound  Not one false step in Four renown'd Campaigns  So bright His humble Modesty has shone  In still consulting His Illustrious Friends  His Counsellors so few so justly chose  His Secrets kept from the most piercing Eyes  His Constancy in executing all  That has so well consulted been so firm  His Spirit as a Captain so sublime  And as a Souldier so Invincible  That Mareschal to remove Him we must Hire  The fiercest and most desperate of thy Men  For my  Bavarians  will that Task refuse  Or Twenty Thousand of yon bravest Troops  Will less obstruct our great Success than He  Hadst thou beheld at  Bleinem  's dreadful Field  In the Distress of the stupend'ous Day  This matchless Man at once a prudent Chief  And a most daring Combatant supply  With His own Valour ev'ry prest Brigade  Each brave Battalion of His fainting Host  For wheresoever Death and Danger flew  T'appall His Squadrons with their ghastly glare  There  Malborough  on the Wings of Thunder flew  Till He brought Conquest back and won the Day  Till Fate He with Majestick Meen dispens'd  And seem'd the dreadful Delegate of  Jove    Hadst thou seen this at  Bleinem  's dreadful Field  Mareschal thou wouldst of Victory despair  Or else conclude this fatal Man must die  But could'st thou with a sharp sagacious Eye  Survey the wonders of his matchless Mind  What Apprehension then would pierce thy Breast  Then what Astonishment would strike thy Mind  For O the jarring Talents which appear  Uniting all their Factions in His Soul  The Heat the Cold the Liveliness the Weight  The Gravity th'astonishing Dispatch  The Providence the Intrepidity  The Fire and the Sedateness of His Soul  And the Revenging Thunder of His Might  Discharg'd without a Tempest on His Breast  Or a black lowring Cloud upon His Brow  Tempests without He raises and He calms  But His great Mind immovable remains  And these great Qualities by turns He shews  Not as His Fancy Humour Passion call  But guided all by Wisdom's sacred Law  As he who made this all the Seasons guides  And alters Hot and Dry and Moist and Cold  By what the changing Universe requires  Is't possible we can a Moment doubt  If we this dangerous General shall destroy  Who having these repugnant Talents joyn'd  Confederated in his mighty Soul  Talents which none besides of Human kind  Enjoys appears design'd by allwise Heav'n  Who nought creates in vain to perform Deeds  Surpassing all the rest of Mortal Race  Who the great Qualities of twenty Chiefs  Possessing still atchieves the Exploits of more▪  Whose Passion for his own accursed Cause  So flaming is so deadly is His Hate  And so invincible to us and ours  That not content to act in His own Sphere  And ev'ry Hour new Wonders to perform  He does the Duty with unwearied Pains  Of Foreign Generals which with all their Thought  And all the Godlike Greatness of their Souls  They were unable to perform themselves  Whereever the Allies appear in Arms  Their brave Battalians  Malb'rough  's Influence feel  With Him their noblest Actions they concert  He furnishes their bravest Chiefs with Troops  And with unhop'd for Treasure He supplies  Yet while to others He gives Pow'r to act  His own unwearied Vigilence is such  His Care His Labour His eternal Thought  As if all others had refus'd to act  As if th'inimitable Man were left  With  Atlantean  Shoulders to sustain  The more than Mortal Burden of the War  Indeed whatever has been greatly done  In  Germany  or in the  Belgian  Plains  Has under his Auspicious Power been done  For He observing with Judicious Thought  That thro' a tedious War your  Gallick  Pow'rs  By the Division of th'Allies prevail'd  Or ow'd Their Conquests to My secret Arts▪  Or by their Numbers gain'd their great Success▪  That They the Field eternally declin'd  Unless by vast Advantages sustain'd  As conscious of the Weakness of their Cause  The Weakness of their boldest Veteran Troops  And falseness of Imaginary Pow'r  Which Two set Battles fought on equal Terms  Would soon demonstrate to the  Christian  World  That ev'n in Fight they close Engagement shunn'd  Till they had tam'd their most intrepid Foes  By odds of Numbers wearied and opprest  He this remarking with sagacious Thought  His Conduct in each Point to theirs oppos'd  And chang'd the Form and Fortune of the War  By His eternal Vigilance His Troops  Are still too numerous to be flank'd by ours  And while He meditates His great Exploits  His secret His impenetrable Heart  Defended stands from Treason's piercing Eye  That Caution from great  William  's Fate he drew  Then He the fatal Hour of Combat seeks  And finds with penetrating Thought or makes  Either halfway he Bald Occasion meets  Or like a Hunter He persues her Flight  Till she at Bay her clustring Forelock turns  Then in the dreadful Field assails your Pow'rs  Nor suffers you with Fury to assault  For which you by the  Christian  World are fam'd  Nor wages then a cool and distant War  But presses on you with redoubled Might  And in upon your firmest Squadrons breaks  Till with his Horse their shatter'd Ranks he tears  Nor made by Nature nor by Climate form'd  The Thunder of such Fury to sustain  And chiefly which has render'd Him to us  A dangerous and a formidable Foe  That no Divisions fraudulently sown  Among th'Allies might hurt the general Cause  There is but one who breaths th'Aetherial Air  And ev'n that one is  Malborough  's second self  So careful to augment or to maintain  Among the various Potentates abroad  That Union which with a Celestial Voice  Great  Anna  to her  Brittains  recommends  He obviates growing Feuds Dissensions grown  He reconciles the Interests He adjusts  And He concerts of each Confederate Pow'r  And in one general Interest mingles all  As Streams from  East  and  West  and  North  and  South    Are mix'd in Ocean's vast Abyss and lost  He Nations and their Kings with Thoughts inspires  Above all little selfish low Designs  And fills them with a publick glorious Fire  In all these things the wondrous Man's concern'd  Which so destructive are to us and ours  With so much Zeal with such Assiduous Thought  With such unwearied Pains no length of Time  Nor any Distance of Remotest Place  Nor the Intemperance of Heat and Cold  Nor Pleasures specious and alluring Bait  The God like Man alas no Pleasure knows  But what the Ruler of yon Heav'n pursues  To do great Good and Glory to acquire  No nor the base Ingratitude of those  Whom Day and Night He watches to preserve  Nor ought that Earth nor ought that Hell invents  Nought but the Stroke of Destiny alone  Is able to obstruct His generous Course  Is able to retard His noble Speed  In the Carrier of everlasting Fame  But with Himself He high Designs revolves  Or those who execute those high Designs  With that familiar Greatness He receives  Which makes Him the Delight of all the Good  And the Felicity of all the Brave  As from these wondrous Talents in Him joyn'd  All that astonishing Success proceeds  Which is become the Darling Theme of Fame  The Theme on which th'eternal Talker doats  So by that high Success is  Malbrough  grown  The Joy of all the Happy Nations round  The Hope and Consolation of the Rest  The Confident of the most Jealous States  The great Example of Earth's Demygods  And the just wonder of the  Christian  World  But with the Squadrons who his Voice obey  So sacred His Authority is grown  So is He honour'd lov'd almost ador'd  By the brave Souldier His adopted Care  Whom with a pious Father's tenderest Love  He guards from Danger and from Want He shields  That when nor Interests loud and pow'rful Voice  Nor smarting Shame nor their dear Countrey's Love  Nor love of Glory longer can prevail  Upon their fainting Spirits to sustain  The fierce Attacks of our Assaulting Bands  His Meen His great Appearance fires their Souls  His potent

 To whom transported  Villeroy  replys  Tis true with Joy and Wonder I have heard  Thy generous Praise of such a deadly Foe  For when so many  English  have been found  Who have with basest Calumnies repaid  His mighty Benefits as great and strong  As ever Hero on his Country laid  That Thou shouldst do the glorious Hero right  Thou who by force of His victorious Arm  Art fall'n from such a Height O whither fall'n  Fall'n from thy Empire from thy Glory fall'n  From those which Thou enjoy'dst and from the Hope  Of Those at which Thy vast Ambition aim'd  That thou shouldst do the wondrous Hero right  That thou shouldst draw the lovely Features like  And place the noble Piece in its true Light  Shews something so magnanimously great  As all the generous  English  would extol  And Godlike  Malborough  himself admire  To whom the Fury in  Bavaria  's Form  The Praise I merit not I must refuse  'Tis not a generous Frailty in my Mind  But great Revenge the Attribute of Gods  That makes me just to  Malborough  's hateful Name  Small Generosity's requir'd to praise  A Merit which by all the World's extoll'd  And which in spight of Slanders cankring Bite  Will be th'eternal Ornament of Fame  If keen Detraction could have hurt His Name  Or Person I Detraction would have us'd  For 'tis with bitterest Gall that I extol  The Hero whom to crush I must commend  Since Calumnies have been essay'd in vain  And Slanders of the blackest hue been tryed  At once his Fame and Person to destroy  And against Both have signified no more  Than Morning Mists against the  Julian  Sun  His rising Glory has dispell'd them all  'Tis time to try what Truth may effect at last  And on her own loud Champion turn her Arms  This Hero I in just proportions drew  That thou may'st be convinc'd by the rich Draught  The way t'attack th'Allies with wish'd Success  Is this pernicious General to destroy  That whole Brigades less Dangerous are than He  That while yon Troops His noble Form inspires  They will Impenetrable still remain  And Fate will follow him as it does  Jove  If then our Interest's pretious in our Eyes  If Victory has Charms for our great Minds  If Glory if the vast th'inspiring

fearful to deny which when the Fiend  Observ'd she with Imperious Tone rejoyn'd  Think 'tis thy Absolute thy Awful Lord  Tis  Lewis  who commands thee to obey  Canst thou assist an Arbitrary King  To

World  From the bright Realms of Everlasting Joy  With Pleasure I am sent to visit Thee  O worthy Successour to me in Arms  O Care of Heav'n O Delegate of Fate  How have I been sollicitous beyond  What is allow'd to blissful Minds above  For  Anna  for  Britannia  and for Thee  And yet when I ascended up to Heav'n  I neither Her nor thee entirely left  For at my parting I left Friends below  O Men with whom ev'n Angels may consult  And on the Firmness of their faithful Zeal  And on their vast Capacity depend  For all my Friends are  Anna  's Friends and Thine  And will unchangeably respect my choice  But Hell and Hell's dire Missionaries here  With Rage implacable thy Life pursue  For  Bleinem  in their Minds has fix'd deep Wounds  Wounds which no length of Days can cure but Time  Exulcerates and Festers and Gangrenes  From  Bleinem  's mortal Day worse Days they expect  No less than Ruine of their Empire here  Therefore to Morrow all their Mortal Darts  Will levell'd be at thy Illustrious Head  And imminent the Danger is and great  But Danger will but raise the noble Fire  Of Thy exalted Soul intent on things  Above this groveling and this worthless World  And if thou fall'st like  Sampson  Thou wilt fall  And bitterly Thy Foes lament Thy Fate  Whatever for Thy Person Heav'n ordains  Yet Heav'n its Champion never will permit  To leave the World inglorious unreveng'd  A wondrous Victory attends thy Arms  Great in it self and in its Sequel vast  Whose ecchoing Sound thro' all the  West  shall run  Transporting the glad Nations all around  Who oft shall doubt and oft suspend their Joy  And oft imagine all an empty Dream  The Conquerour himself shall cry amaz'd  'Tis not our Work alas we did it not  The Hand of God the Hand of God is here  For Thee so great shall be thy high Renown  That Fame shall think no Musick like thy Name  Around the circling Globe it shall be spread  And to the World's last Ages shall endure  Heroes of Ancient Times Thou shalt eclipse  And the most lofty most aspiring Man  Shall want th'Assurance in his secret Pray'rs  To ask such high Felicity and Fame  As Heav'n has freely granted Thee yet this  That seems so great so glorious to Thee now  Would look how low how vile to Thy great Mind  If I could set before thy astonish'd Eyes  Th'excess of Glory and th'excess of Bliss  That is prepar'd for Thy aspiring Soul  When Thou arriv'st at everlasting Day  O could embodied Mind but comprehend  The Glories of the Intellectual World  Or I the blissful Secret were allowd  But Fate forbids to Mortals to reveal  O I could lay a Scene before thy Eyes  Which would distract Thee with transporting Joy  Fire the rich Blood in thy Illustrious Veins  Make ev'ry Nerve with fierce Convulsions start  Blast all thy Spirits and thy Life destroy  Thou could'st not tast th'extatick Bliss and live  As one who has liv'd thirty tedious Years  And ever since his wretched Birth been Dark  His visual Orbs with cloudy Films o'recast  And in the Dungeon of the Body dwelt  In utter Ignorance of Nature's Works  And Wonders of this vast material World  And has no Notion e're conceiv'd of Light  Or Colours or the verdant Flow'ry Earth  Or the stupendous prospect of the Sky  If then he finds some Artist whose nice Hand  Couches the Cataracts and clears his Eyes  And all at once a Flood of glorious Light  And this bright Temple of the Universe  The crystal Firmament the blazing Sun  All th'amazing Glories of the Heavens  All the great Maker's high Magnificence  Come rushing thro' His Eyes upon His Soul  He cannot bear th'astonishing Delight  But starts exclaims and stamps and raves and dies  So the vast Glories of the upper World  If they were set before embodied Mind  Would oppress Nature and extinguish Life  For all the Beauties of the World that's seen  As glorious as they look to Human Eyes  Are little are contemptible to them  Like glimmering Starlight to the Blaze of Day  For Thee let this suffize the Share of Bliss  And Glory that's prepar'd for Thee above  Is such as shall distinguish Thee from most  For since the Glory of the Just in Heav'n  Is equal to their Charity on Earth  What must be thine who labour'st to unite  Who labour'st to felicitate a World  I say not this to fortifie thy Mind  Against the Fear of Death Thou hast no Fear  For Thou hast been familiar with Him long  Been often dauntless with Him Face to Face  And calmly look'd upon His Gorgon Eye  As finding nothing there t'affright a Soul  That conscious is of Glory Bliss and Life  Unbounded all as vast Eternity  Ev'n I not more intrepid was on Earth  Than Thou nor am not more undaunted now  But this is said that on this dreadful Day  Thou may'st do Deeds that may excel ev'n thine  And surpass Him who all the World transcends  Thou shalt have Millions of Immortal Minds  Glorious Spectators of thy Immortal Acts  And tow'ring o're Thee still Thou shalt behold  Bright Victory and me he said and

Malborough  wakes  For when the Angel vanish'd from His Eyes  He shot half Heav'n into the Heroes Mind  His Mind was with Immortal Hope inspir'd  Celestial Confidence Celestial Fire  A Flame that in his noble Breast aspir'd  To things above the Greatness of this World  And Joy which Human Hearts can ne're conceive  Unspeakable Transporting yet Serene  Wisdom's Serene Companion and Her Friend  Prophetick of Felicity and Fame  Awak'd He rises from His Bed in haste  And after Him in hast the Sun arose  Impatient to behold his wondrous Deeds  Gazing He sees the Grandeur of his Meen  Exalted with a Dreadful Majesty  And all the Honours heightned of His Eyes  And all th'Heroick Virtues of His Mind  All but His great Contempt of Death encreas'd  For that was Sovereign in His Soul before  And while the Sun above th'Horizon rose  Ten thousand brighter Glories from the Skies  Descended to behold or to assist  In the Contention of th'Eternal Day  For the Immortal Day was to decide  No trifling small Affairs no mean Dispute  The Limits of small Kingdoms or the Bounds  Of poor Provincial Tributary Lords  But the Contention of th'Eternal Day  Was to decide in great  Ramillia  's Field  If God should reign o're His own Works below  Or Hell usurp them with Tyrannick Sway  And now the dreadful Trumpet sounds to Arms  When distant Clangours are like Ecchoes heard  Th'Angelick Trumpet of Celestial Fame  Which to Immortal Deeds excites their Souls  And now they march t'attack th'embattel'd Foe  And now in terrible Array appear  Awaiting their Commanders Awful Voice  Like Tempests low'ring in the Heav'ns they look  That black'ning all the Sky in silence stand  Before th'outragious Wrack of Heav'n begins  Like the  Virgilian  God of Winds their Chief  Who musters sounding Storms and rules their Rage  With pleasure He their Martial Eyes surveys  And finds them with Heroick Rage inspir'd  He finds they want no Speech to raise their Souls  To mightiest Deeds for in their Eyes He sees  They have already gain'd the glorious Day  Up to the Heav'ns His Eyes the Hero casts  And there the Angel with His flaming Sword  And Victory with Eagles Wings He spies  Towring along the vast Aethereal Space  And now a glorious Flame from Heav'n descends  And agitates and shakes His mighty Soul  And this is the first Hour that e're He found  Its Movements difficult to be restrain'd  With Ardor strait He gives the fatal Word  And now the Trumpet sounds the dreadful Charge  And like the last Eternal Trump it sounds  For now at hand the End of Time appears  And the expiring Worlds last ghastful Hour  For Hideous is the Face of Nature now  The Heav'ns are all on fire the  Welkin  burns  Earth trembles and the Air tormented groans  The warring Elements Earth Air and Fire  Are raging in stupend'ous motion all  And Earth with Air confounded and with Fire  And Bursts of horrid Thunder rend the Heav'ns  And seem to be expiring Natures Groans  But no swift Motion no Impetuous Rage  Of missive Earth or of exploded Air  Or of expanded Fire can equal half  Th'outragious Motions of undaunted Minds  Divinely swift in Tenements of Clay  While to th'Attack th'embattell'd Squadrons move  And clashing with amazing Fury joyn  On one side th'Angel and bright Victory  On th'other Discord with th'Infernal Pow'rs  And all the Auxiliaries of Heaven and Hell  Their mighty Movements for a while suspend  The Motions of frail Mortals to behold  Who Transports of Immortal Fury shew  Above the weak Condition of poor Dust  Above the frail Concerns of wretched Men  While wondring they behold with all their Eyes  The whole Confederate and the  Gallick  Pow'rs  Raging and working like divided Seas  Which Adverse Storms against each other drive  While  Jove  's Artillery rattling o're them flies  All their admiring Eyes are chiefly bent  On  Malborough  's ev'ry Motion ev'ry Look  Next Him  Argyle  drew all their wondring Eyes  Argyle  the Young the Beautiful the Brave  Fit for deep Counsels ev'n in early Bloom  Of Thought profound without Experience Wise  Without the Ruinous Expence of Years  In Counsel all Sedateness and all Thought  But in the Bloody Field all Rage all Fire  Champion of Union in the Bloody Field  Where still the Godlike Youth made War for Peace  In Cabinets He Union too advis'd  And in grave Senates constantly He strove  The jarring Nations to unite in

sounding Devastation comes behind  Argyle  was like the fancied God of Love  When He contracts His Brow and bends His Bow  And drawing his Inevitable Shafts  Wounds deeply Human Breasts t'unite their Hearts  Without their furious  Britons  both appear  And Foreign Squadrons to the Charge they lead  But  Germans    Danes  and  Dutch  turn  Britons  all  When  Britons  Genius in its Godlike Chiefs  Shines out and fires them to Immortal Deeds  And leads them to the Charge unknowing to retire  O would some Angel give me force to paint  The dreadful stalk of Discords sounding March  Between conflicting Hosts before her march'd  Ten thousand Terrours Natives all of Hell  Commanded by their grizly Monarch Death  Each stride entrench'd the Earth on which she strode  The Air was tempested the Aether frown'd  Mean while the Snaky Horrours of her Head  Were wrapt in pitchy Clouds from which her Eyes  Red Lightning Dart and Thunder was her Voice  As sternly she the Field of Death surveys  And finds that Fate in ev'ry other part  Was doubtful but where mighty  Malb'rough  shin'd  There Victory there Destiny declar'd  She gives a monstrous Yell that frighting shakes  The utmost Fortresses of  Belgian  Land  The Mountains tremble at the horrid Din  The Vales rebellow to the monstrous Roar  When thus the Terrours and their grizly King  The Fury in a frightful Tone accosts  Have ye then found an overmatch at last  Are ye contented basely to submit  To the Efforts of yon Confederate Pow'rs  O're which till  Malb'rough  at their Head appear'd  Ye always have prevail'd nay now prevail  O're Squadrons which remote from Him engage  But see He comes this Thunderbolt of War  Look how against the Storm He Headlong drives  By all that's Impious upon us He drives  Nay now He's in the midst of us He's here  He unconcern'd and only we amaz'd  Is it then possible that one frail Man  Can thus resist the Force of all your Pow'rs  And drive you frighted back upon your Friends  And can ye poorly bear th'extream Affront  Ye Host of Terrours and thou grizly Death  If ye are Terrours arm'd with deadly Stings  If thou art Death my cruel Offspring Death  And not an empty Bugbear to scare Boys  Oh fly oh seize dispatch th'audacious wretch  Oh pierce Him stab Him in the vitall st Part  Ha how agast with stupid Eyes thou star'st  To see this  Briton  amidst all thy Pow'rs  Serene and with a Dauntless Brow appear  Thou Fool with all this Calm and Dreadless Brow  This is no God but a meer Mortal Man  As subject to Thy Arm as the vile Slave  Muster Thy Terrours then in dire Array  And scare this hitherto undaunted Brave  Then then be ready with thy Fatal Dart  Let me alone to give Thee certain aim  And so dispatching one we conquer all  But who tho' Master of an Angel's Force  An Angel's Genius and an Angel's Voice  Of Song Celestial Eloquence Divine  Can worthily describe in dreadful Style  The fearful March of the Infernal Pow'rs  Who now prepare t'attack great  Malb'rough  's Life  Grim Death his meager Skeleton expands  Into a Form Immense then musters all  His Terrours in astonishing Array  And charges them t'appear to Mortal Eyes  His Terrours put on their most hideous Forms  Forms which with Horrour Nature sees and shakes  And from its Outworks Trembling Life retreats  And to the Heart its Cittadel retires  In  Phalanx  then the Hero they assail  The Godlike Hero views them and reviews  Considers them disdains them and repells  But into Madness starts the generous Steed  At the dire sight he flies he bounds he foams  Flashes of Lightning from his EyeBalls flie  And from his Nostrils curling Clouds of Smoak  Then shrieking on his hindmost Feet he springs  Then groans and floundring with his Rider falls  The  Gaul  and the  Bavarian  rend the Sky  Discord returns the Roar of vast Applause  And Death and all th'Infernal Pow'rs rejoyce  But thro' th'Allies a mortal Murmur runs  And all their Spirit's with their Hero fall'n  And Victory has Charms for them no more  The Heavn'ly Spirits are themselves concern'd  And for a Moment wonder what this means  And doubt least they mistook the Voice of Fate  The Ruffians now whom Discord had suborn'd  Present a Hundred Fusees at His Life  At once an Hundred Fiery Globes discharge  But a strong unseen Hand diverts them all  Grim Death bestrides Him with a Gyant stride  And scowls upon Him with a Walley'd glare  Then lifting brandishes His fatal Dart  Yet wants the pow'r to strike but looks askew  And cannot bear the Heroes dauntless Eye  When Discord cries aloud O strike my Son  Is not our dreadful Adversary fall'n  Yes from the Pinnacle of Glory fall'n  Fall'n in a Moment to the abjectest State  O foolish Sentence Judgment falsly past  For hear the Angel in th'Aethereal Space  O greatest Thou he cries of Mortal Men  Who art as Dauntless in the Arms of Death  As we whom Heav'n has plac'd above His reach  Serene as when Thou o'recam'st at  Bleinem  's Field  Then Conquest saw Thee Humble and Serene  Death finds Thee firm and undejected now  O greatest Thou he cries of Mortal Men  Courage surpassing Human Godlike State  Which nothing can depress and nothing raise  Never was Mortal more severly tryed  But now 'tis past and perfect art Thou found  And worthy found to free the Lab'ring World  For since within the very Arms of Death  Thou hast the high Security enjoy'd  Of Blissful Beings who can die no more  Thou shalt their high Felicity enjoy  For thy unshaken Mind can bear it all  What Angels dictate and what Angels do  Whose Words and Acts are swifter than our Thoughts  In Moments Mortals cannot speak in Hours  Down He comes shooting on His Golden Wings  And on the Spot in all His Glory lights  Where in the Arms of Death His  Malb'rough  lay  The Hero quicken'd by th'approach of Heav'n  Springs from th'embrace of Death and on His Feet  As swift as are the Wings of Lightning Bounds  The Heavenly Spirits in th'Aetherial Space  And all the Empyrean Shouts for Joy  When He who while He sojourn'd here on Earth  First His Command to Godlike  Malbro  ' gave  Sent down from Heaven now gives it Him once more  The Troops are wild with extasie of Joy  To see their General from the Bonds of Death  To Conpuest and Eternal Glory rise  Death from Immortal Splendour roaring flies  And yelling Discord flies from Love Divine  Now the Brave Squadrons to His Aid arrive  And now another fiery Steed present  And with their cries the eager Hero urge  To lead them on to everlasting Fame  The Hero mounts the Squadrons rend the Skies  Mounting with Him to Heav'n their Spirits soar  The Hero mounts but Discord while He mounts  And Death outragious to be thus repuls'd  Level a Canon at His Sacred Head  But from His Sacred Head the pondrous Ball  Diverted  Bringfield  who remounts Him kills  And consecrates Him to Eternal Fame  Who dies for such a Chief in such a Cause  Thro' the Confederate Troops the Angel now  The Spirit of Celestial Union spreads  And He who while he sojourn'd here on Earth  First bound the Nations in the Bonds of Love  Is sent from Heav'n that Union to confirm  And to augment in great  Ramillia  's Field  Malb'rough  remounted feels the Joys of Heav'n  The Wisdom and the Force of Gods He feels  And now He leads the shouting Squadrons on  Daring as if they were Immortal all  With Hearts and Souls unanimous they advance  United as they were one Nation all  One Family Relations all and Friends  One Interest have They all one Noble Cause  With Fury inexpressible They advance  And greatly each resolves to Die for all  The  French  who brave Resistance made till now  Now can Their fierce Attacks no longer bear  They can no longer bear their very Eyes  And fatal Meens but fainting all recoil  And Death and Discord with their Hellborn Host  Headlong upon their  Gallick  Friends are diven  The routed  Gauls  Divide Disband Disperse  They flie the Angel waves His Flaming Sword  At which expected Signal on the Wing  Th'Amazing Terrours of th'Almighty stoop  And persecute and plague their broken Rear  Make some precipitate their shameful Flight  While others basely beg for wretched Life  And others Trembling Faint and Sink and Die  Thus Discord and the  Gaul  were forc'd to yield  To  Malb'rough  and to Union's Sacred Pow'r  The END  ERRATA  Page line for  retire  read  retires▪
