to the performers of this Farce for the great justice they have done me I must beg leave to address myself in particular to  you  As your wishes produced the piece and your performance has raised it into some consequence to whom can it be so properly address'd You were before rank'd in the first class of our Theatrical Genuises and now you have the additional merit of transforming the GRECIAN DAUGHTER into  the IRISH WIDOW that is of sinking  to the lowest note from the top of the compass  Permit me Madam like other Coxcombs to boast some favours I have receivedYou perform the principal character some newspapers have criticis'd the Farce and the audiences have laugh'd heartily at it Were not I as sensible as the severest Critick of them all that it is a triffle not worth the owning I should subscribe my real name instead of  MADAM  Your great admirer And humble servant The AUTHOR  THE IRISH WIDOW  ACT I  SCENE I Whittle's House  Enter  BATES  and Servant  BATES  IS he gone out his

independance he so often has promis'd me he came to Scarborough for that purpose and wish'd me joy of my choice but in less than a week his approbation turned into a passion for her he now hates the sight of me and is resolv'd with the consent of the father to make her his wife directly  BATES  So he keeps you out of your fortune won't give his consent which his Brother's foolish will requires and he would marry himself the same woman because right title conscience nature justice and every law divine and human are against it  NEPHEW  Thus he tricks me at once both of wife and fortune without the least want of either  BATES  Well said friend WHITTLE but it can't be it shan't be and it must not bethis is murder and robbery in the strongest sense and he shan't be hang'd in chains to

seperated ever after for their particular pleasuresO rare matrimonyWhere does she lodge  NEPHEW  In PallMall near the Hotel  BATES  I'll call in my way and assist at the consultation I am for a bold stroke if gentle methods should fail  NEPHEW  We have a plan and a spirited one if my sweet widow is able to go through itpray let us have your friendly assistanceours is the cause of love and reason

BATES  This it is to be in love THOMAS  THOMAS  He may make free with himself he shan't make a fool of mehe has got his head into a bag but I won't have a pigtail tack'd to mineand so I told him  BATES  What did you tell him  THOMAS  That as I and my father and his father before me had wore their own hair as heaven had sent it I thought myself rather too old to set up for a monkey at my time of life and wear a pigtailhe he hehe took it  BATES  With a wry face for it was wormwood  THOMAS  Yes he was frump'd and call'd me old blockhead and would not speak to me the rest of the  daybut the

I was for liberty and a strait head of hair  BATES  Well said THOMAShe could not answer that  THOMAS  The poorest man in England is a match for the greatest if he will but stick to the laws of the

my heart to act contrary to its feelings would not you hate me for being a hypocrite tho' it is done for your sake  NEPHEW  Could I think myself incapable of such ingratitude  WIDOW  Don't make fine speeches you men are strange creatures you turn our heads to your purposes and then despise us for the folly you teach us 'tis hard to assume a character contrary to my disposition I cannot get rid of my unfashionable prejudices till I have been married in England some time and liv'd among my betters  NEPHEW  Thou charming adorable woman what shall we  do then I never wish'd for a fortune till this moment  WIDOW  Could we live upon affection I would give your fortune to your Uncle and thank him for taking it and then  NEPHEW  What then my sweet Widow  WIDOW  I would desire you to run away with me as fast as you can what a pity it is that this money which my heart despises should hinder its happiness or that for want of a few dirty acres a poor woman must be made miserable and sacrificed twice to those who have them  NEPHEW  Heaven forbid these exquisite sentiments endear you more to me and distract me with the dread of losing you  BATES  Young folks let an old man who is not quite in love and yet will admire a fine woman to the day of his death throw in a little advice among your flames and darts  WIDOW  Tho' a woman a widow and in love tooI can hear reason Mr BATES  BATES  And that's a wonderyou have no time to lose for want of a jointure you are still your father's slave he is obstinate and has promis'd you to the old man Now madam if you will not rise superior to your sexes weakness to secure a young fellow instead of an old one your eyes are a couple of hypocrites  WIDOW  They are a eouple of traytors I'm sure and have led their mistress into a toil from which all her wit cannot release her  NEPHEW  But it can if you will but exert it my Uncle ador'd and fell in love with you for your beauty softness and almost speechless reserve Now if amidst all his rapturous ideas of your delicacy you would bounce upon him a wild ranting buxom widow he will grow sick of his bargain and give me a fortune to take you off his hands  WIDOW  I shall make a very bad actress  NEPHEW  You are an excellent mimic assume but the character of your Irish female neighbour in the country with which you astonish'd us so agreeably at Scarborough you will frighten my Uncle into terms and do that for us which neither my love nor your virtue can accomplish without it  WIDOW  Now for a trial  mimicking a strong brogue  fait and trot if you will be after bringing me before the old Gontleman if he loves musick I will trate his ears with a little of the brogue and some dancing too into the bargain if he loves caperingO bless me my heart fails me and I am frighten'd out of my wits

insure you success I can scarce believe my own cars such a tongue and a brogue would make Hercules tremble at fiveandtwenty but away away and give him the first broadside in the Park there you'll find him hobbling with that old cuckold KECKSY  WIDOW  But will my dress suit the character I play  NEPHEW  The very thing is your retinue ready and your part got by heart  WIDOW  All is ready 'tis an act of despair to punish folly and reward merit 'tis the last effort of pure honourable love and if every woman would exert the same spirit for the same outoffashion rarity there would be less business for Doctors Commons Now let the criticks laugh at me if they dare  Exit with spirit  NEPHEW  Brava bravissima sweet Widow  Exit after her  BATES  Huzza huzza  Exit  SCENE the Park  Enter  WHITTLE  and  KECKSY  WHITTLE  Yes yes she is Irish but so modest so mild and so tender and just enough of the accent to give a peculiar sweetness to her words which drop from her in monasyllables with such a delicate reserve that I shall have all the comfort without the impertinence of a wife  KECK  There our taste differs friend I am for a lively smart girl in my house hugh hugh to keep up my spirits and make me merry I don't admire dumb waiters not I no stilllife for me I love their prittle prattle it sets me to sleep and I can take a sound nap while my sally and her cousin are running and playing about the house like young cats  WHITTLE  I am for no cats in my house I cannot sleep with a noise the widow was made on purpose for me she is so bashful has no acquaintance and she never would stir out of doors if her friends were not afraid of a consumption and so force her into the air Such a delicate creature you shall see her you were always for a tall chattering frisky wench now for my part I am with the old saying  Wife a mouse  Quiet house  Wife a cat  Dreadful that  KECK  I don't care for your sayingswho's afraid  WHITTLE  There goes BATES let us avoid him he will only be joking with

about you that you swear you have they would have cur'd you by killing you long ago Would you have me faitless to your Uncle hah young man Was not I faitful to you 'till I was order'd to be faitful to him but I must know more of your English ways and live more among the English Ladies to learn how to be faitful to two at a timeand so there's my answer for you  NEPHEW  Then I know my relief for I cannot live without you  Exit  WIDOW  Take what relief you plase young Jontleman what have I to do with dat He is certainly mad or out of his sinses for he swears he can't  live  without me and yet he talks of  killing  himself how does he make out dat If a countryman of mine had made such a blunder they would have put it into all the newspapers and Falkner's Journal beside but an Englishman may look over the hedge while an Irishman must not stale a horse  KECK  Is this the Widow friend WHITTLE  WHITTLE  I don't know  half sighing  it is and it is not  WIDOW  Your servant Mr WHITTOL I wish you would  spake to your Nephew not to be whining and dangling after me all day in his green coat like a parrot It is not for my reputation that he should follow me about like a beggarman and ask me

same effect upon me as upon stammering peoplethey can't spake for their impediment and my tongue is fix'd so loose in my mouth I can't stop it for the life of me  WHITTLE  What a terrible misfortune friend KECKSY  KECK  Not at all the more tongue the better say I  WIDOW  When the wind changes I have no brogue at all at all But come Mr WHITTOL don't let us be vulgar and talk of our poor relations

fireworks to cool and refresh one in the summer La la la  sings  WHITTLE  I protest she puts me into a sweat we shall have a mob about us  KECK  The more the merrier I saywho's afraid  WIDOW  How the

you were at Scarborough and winning my affections you were all mirth and gaiety and now you have won me you are as thoughtful about it as if we had been married some time  WHITTLE  Indeed Madam I can't but say I am a little thoughtfulwe take it by turns you were very sorrowful a month ago for the loss of your husband and that you could dry up your tears so soon naturally makes me a little thoughtful  WIDOW  Indeed I could dry up my tears for a dozen husbands when I were sure of having a tirteenth like Mr WITTOL that's very natural sure both in England and Dublin too  KECK  She won't die of a consumption she has a fine fullton'd voice and you'll be very happy TOMHugh hugh  WHITTLE  O yes very happy  aside  WIDOW  But come don't let us be melancholy before the time I am sure I have been mop'd up for a year and a half I was oblig'd to mourn for my first husband that I might be sure of a second and my father kept my spirits in subjection as the best receipt he said for changing a widow into a wife But now I have my arms and legs at liberty I must and will have my swing now I am out of  my cage I could dance two nights togeder and a day too like any singing bird and I'm in such

whole family you have screw'd him too high the young man is out of his senses  I think he stares and mopes about and sighs looks at me indeed but gives very absurd answers I don't like him  WHITTLE  What is the matter think you  BATES  What I have always expected there is a crack in your family and you take it by turns you have had it and now transfer it to your Nephew which to your shame be it spoken is the only transfer you have ever made him  WHITTLE  But am not I going to do him more than justice  BATES  As you have done him much less than justice hitherto you can't begin too soon  WHITTLE  Am not I going to give him the lady he likes and which I was going to marry myfelf  BATES  Yes that is your are taking a perpetual blister off your own back to clap it upon his what a tender Uncle you are  WHITTLE  But you don't consider the estate which I shall give him  BATES  Restore  to him you mean'tis his own and you should have given it up long ago you must do more or old nick will have you your Nephew won't take the Widow off your hands without a fortune throw him ten thousand into the bargain  WHITTLE  Indeed but I shan't he shall run mad and I'll marry her myself rather than

can bring it right again so soon as ten thousand pounds shall I promise for you  WHITTLE  I'll sooner go to Bedlam myself  Exit  BATES  WHITTLE  Why I am in a worse condition than I was before If this Widow's father will not let me be off without providing for his daughter I may lose a great sum of money and none of us be the better for it My Nephew half mad myself half married and no remedy for either of us  Enter  Servant  Sir Patrick O' Neale is come to wait upon you would you please to see him  WHITTLE  By all means the very person I wanted don't let him wait  Exit Servant  I wonder if he has seen my letter to the Widow I will sound him by degrees that I may be sure of my mark before I strike the blow  Enter Sir  PATRICK  Sir PATRICK  Mr WHIZZLE your humble sarvant it gives me grate pleasure that an old Jontleman of your property will have the honour of being united with the family of the O' Neale's we have been too much Jontlemen not to spend our estate as  you have made yourself a kind of Jontleman by getting one one runs out one way and t'other runs in another which makes them both meet at last and keeps up the ballance of Europe  WHITTLE  I am much oblig'd to you Sir PATRICK I am an old gentleman you say true and I was thinking  Sir  PATRICK  And I was thinking if you were ever so old my daughter can't make you young again she has as fine rich tick blood in her veins as any in all Ireland I wish you had a swate crater of a daughter like mine that we might make a double cross of it  WHITTLE  That would be a double cross indeed  aside  Sir  PATRICK  Tho' I was miserable enough with my first wife who had the devil of a spirit and the very moddel of her daughter yet a brave man never shrinks from danger and I may have better luck another time  WHITTLE  Yes but I am no brave man Sir PATRICK and I begin to shrink already  Sir  PATRICK  I have bred her up in great subjiction she is as tame as a young colt and as tinder as a sucking chicken you will find her a true Jontlewoman and so knowing that you can tache her nothing she brings every thing but money and you have enough of that if you have nothing else and that is what I call the ballance of things  WHITTLE  But I have been considering your daughter's great deserts and my great age  Sir  PATRICK  She is a charming crater I would venture to say that if I was not her father  WHITTLE  I say Sir as I have been considering your daughter's great deserts and as I own I have great demerits  Sir  PATRICK  To be sure you have but you can't help that and if my daughter was to mention any thing of a fleering at your age or your stinginess by the ballance of power but I would make her repate it a hundred times to your face to make her asham'd of it but mum old gentleman the devil a word of your infirmities will she touch upon I have brought her up to softness and to gentleness as a kitten to new milk she will spake nothing but no and yes as if she were dumb and no tame rabbit or pigeon will keep house or be more inganious with her needle and tambourine  WHITTLE  She is vastly altered then since I saw her last or I have lost my senses and in either case we had much better since I must speak plain not come together  Sir  PATRICK  'Till you are married you meanwith all my heart it is the more gentale for that and like our family I never saw lady O'Nale your motherinlaw who poor crater is dead and can never be a motherinlaw again 'till the week before I married her and I did not care if I had never seen her  then which is a comfort too in case of death or other accidents in life  WHITTLE  But you don't understand me Sir PATRICK I say  Sir  PATRICK  I say how can that be when we both spake English  WHITTLE  But you mistake my meaning and don't comprehend me  Sir  PATRICK  Then you don't comprehend yourself Mr WHIZZLE and I have not the gift of prophecy to find out after you have spoke what never was in you  WHITTLE  Let me intreat you to attend to me a little  Sir

PATRICK  To be or  not  to be is that the question I can swear too if it wants a little of that  WHITTLE  Dear Sir Patrick hear me I confess myself unworthy of her I have the greatest regard for you Sir PATRICK I should think myself honour'd by being in your family but there are many reasons  Sir  PATRICK  To be sure there are many reasons why an old man should not marry a young woman but as that was your business and not mine  WHITTLE  I have wrote a letter to your daughter which I was in hopes you had seen and had brought me an answer to it  Sir  PATRICK  What the devil Mr WIZZLE do you make a letterporter of me Do you imagine you dirty fellow with your cash that Sir PATRICK O NALE would carry your letters I would have you know that I despise letters and all that belong to 'em nor would I carry a letter to the King Heaven bless him unless it came from myself  WHITTLE  But dear Sir PATRICK don't be in a passion for nothing  Sir  PATRICK  What is it nothing to make a penny postman of me But I'll go to my daughter directly for I have not seen her to day and if I find that you have written any thing that I won't understand I shall take it an affront to my family and you shall either
