 AN ESSAY ON THE History of Parties AND PERSECUTION IN  BRITAIN  Beginning With a brief Account of the  TestAct  and an Historical Enquiry into the Reasons the Original and the Consequences of the  Occasional Conformity  of  Dissenters    With some Remarks on the several Attempts already made and now making for an  Occasional Bill    Enquiring how far the same may be esteem'd a Preservation to the  Church  or an Injury to the  Dissenters  LONDON  Printed for  J Baker  at the  BlackBoy  in  PaternosterRow  Price  d    AN ESSAY  c  IN order to enquire Critically into the Reason and Justice as well as Consequences of an  Occasional Bill  or an Act to prevent the Occasional Conformity of  Dissenters  it seems necessary to state as distinctly and in a Method as unexceptionable as may be the  Nature  and  Original  of the Thing call'd  Occasional Conformity  and by what Steps the present Debates about it have come upon the Stage  That this may be done with as little Offence as possible we shall deduce things in a brief Historical Narration from undoubted Testimony of Fact recent to the Memory of most observing Men in this Age and not to be contradicted by the false Glosses or Misrepresentations of any And if by this it should appear that the following are undoubted Truths of unquestion'd Authority  then all the Vehemence which some have used in presenting the several Acts against  Occasional Conformity  will appear so many Attempts  Whether knowingly or ignorantly is not to the Purpose  against the Constitution and against the just Right of their Country  That is to say  If it it appears That the Act of Parliament called  The TestAct  has been inverted by the Sinister Designs of a Party among us and being in its true Intent and Meaning formed against  Popish  Recusants only has been turned against our Fellow Protestants to the weakning and injuring the Interest of the Protestant Religion in general in this Kingdom  If it appears That it is a Law unjust in its own Nature and inconsistent with the Native Rights of the Subjects of  England  as well as with the Sovereignty of Conscience which ought not to be imposed upon  If it appears inconsistent with the Christian Religion and with the Principles and Doctrine of the Church of  England  If the manner in which it is put in Practice appears to be a Plot against the Peace of the Nation and a constant Handle  to the Strife of Parties and Oppression of the Innocent  If upon an Impartial Enquiry into the History of this Law these things should appear then it may be worth our Consideration whether we should still pursue a thing so fatal to the General Good and be for ever Sacrificing one another to the Resentment of Parties robbing each other of the Peace Liberty and Birthright of  Englishmen  under the Forms but contrary to the true Intent and Meaning of the Law  From this short Introduction and in order to lay these Things more plainly before us That  English  Protestants may see what they are doing and may not sacrifice one another to the Interests of the Enemies of both We proceed to ransack from the Beginning the Records of these Things that the Truth being brought forth into a clear Light and viewed with open unblinded Eyes the present Generation may have none to blame but themselves if they pull down the Liberties and Religion of their Ancestors with their own Hands  After the Restoration of King  Charles  II had been for some Years perfected and the Court as well as the Kingdom was gotten  over their first Transports enjoy'd a full Dominion over the  PuritanParty  as they call'd them and had for two or three Years suppressed the Remains of them by severe Prosecutions of  Dissenters  suppressing  Conventicles  Fining Imprisoning and Confiscating the Hearers and Banishing as by the CorporationAct their Ministers or Preachers Five Miles from every considerable Town and the like the Nobility and Gentry of  England  began to see that while their Eyes had been taken up with pursuing these lesser Evils of  Schism  in Religion among Protestants they had as the Consequence of such Proceedings generally proves insensibly suffered the secret Encroachments of  Rome  and of  France  and opened a Door to  Popery  and  Tyranny  It would be too tedious a thing to undertake here what all our Histories are full of  viz  To give an Account by what insensible Degrees the King influenc'd by the Council of his Brother a declared  Papist  and by his own Resolutions himself as appear'd at his Death being secretly a  Papist  an Account whereof shall in these Tracts be at large made Publick suffer'd himself and all his Councils to be acted and managed by the Artifice of  France  and being himself a Pensioner to the King of  France  brought his whole Kingdom to be passively  subservient and actively assistant to the Rising Exorbitance of that Prince whose Power so assisted has since grown too great for all  Europe  and has cost this same Nation whose Blood and Valour assisted them  to rise  so much Blood and Treasure since  to reduce  At length tho' late the People of  England  took the Alarm when in the Year the King of  France  made that dreadful Eruption into  Holland  attacking the  Dutch  with three formidable Armies at once without any Provocation any Satisfaction demanded or Cause assign'd save that he was ill satisfied in them  At the first of this War we wretchedly assisted  France  not only by Land but declared War against the  Dutch  and fell upon them by Sea in a manner too dishonourable for an  Englishman  to say much of  viz  falling upon their  Smyrna  Fleet while in full Peace they might be supposed to come securely into our Channel if not into our very Harbours The rest we choose to cover with a Hand of Charity rather than expose the Nakedness of those Times more than the Necessity of the present Argument obliges us to  The Successes of  France  against the  Dutch  reduc'd the States to the Brink of Ruine and  Naerden  being taken by the Duke of  Luxemburgh  it was expected that  Amsterdam  which was but Miles off would have sent Deputies to make their Submission to  France  But in this Interim the Massacre of the  de Witts  and the Ruine of the  Barnavelt  Faction intervening the Prince of  Orange  afterwards King  William  of Glorious Memory a Prince born for the Rescuing oppress'd Nations and for a Refuge to the Protestant Religion was restor'd to the Administration of the Affairs in  Holland  revived the Courage of the desponding People and in a little time drove the  French  as fast out of the Country as they came in  These things and the Progress of the  French  in  Flanders  alarm'd  England  as we hinted above and put us upon Enquiring into our State at Home Endeavours were us'd to bring  England  over and the Pulse of the People in Parliament beat so high against  France  that the Court was oblig'd to make a shew of Changing Sides Peace was made with the  Dutch  an Offer of Marriage of the Princess  Mary  afterwards Queen  Mary  to the Prince of  Orange  and several measures taken which look'd like a War with  France  tho' nothing less intended  An Army was rais'd Three Millions seven hundred thousand Pounds given by Parliament for the Carrying it on but such hold had the  Popish  and  French  Councils  gotten in the  English  Court that all the Means which were possible to be used could never get the King to Declare War but at last ended all in the Treaty of  Nimeguen  a Peace wholly to the Advantage of  France  During these Transactions the Patriots of the Protestant Interest in this Nation finding the Influence which  French  and  Popish  Emissaries had on the King and finding the  Popish  Lords in the House always vigorous to oppose every thing which was for the advancing the new Measures they apply'd themselves to several Methods in order to weaken the  Popish  Party They could not yet obtain an Act to prevent the  Popish  Lords Sitting in the House but the present Case was to prevent  Popish  Officers in the Army who were so many and behaved so Insolently that the Army then raised and incamp'd at  BlackHeath  under a Pretence of the War with  France  was become a Terror to the People and was called the  Cutthroat Army    The Earl of  Shaftsbury  who till then had been one of the Five Capital Letters which formed the Word CABAL was the Man who contriv'd and brought in the Proposal for a Bill to dispossess these  Popish  Officers And the Title of the Act expressed the Meaning and Design of its being  brought in The King the Court and all the  Popish  and  French  Interest opposed it with all their Might but the Popular Terror and the just Fear the People were in of a  Popish  Army prevailed and it pass'd by a great Majority neither did the King think fit to oppose himself to the Stream of the whole Nation at that time especially there being a great MoneyBill then depending in the House for no less than  l  which would have been lost So the Bill pass'd  Carol  and is Intitled  An Act for preventing Dangers which may arise from Popish Recusants  This is the Famous  TestAct  and that the true Intent and Meaning of this Act and the Reason of its making may more plainly appear the Preamble to the Act is thus  For Preventing Dangers which may happen from Popish Recusants and for quieting the Minds of His Majesties good Subjects  The  Æ²neasiness of His Majesties good Subjects  was at that time manifest to be their Fears of the Army and Court being put into the Hands of  Papists  and the People who push'd on the Act were those very People who espousing Liberty and Property obtain'd in Contempt from the CourtParty the Name of  Whiggs    But further to explain this Matter the Court which with all possible Management and Art opposed this Law endeavour'd to alarm the  Dissenters  with their Danger from this Act and Alderman  LOVE  Representative for the City of  London  a Man of unspotted Integrity was privately spoken to that he might oppose it on behalf of the  Dissenters  This at first had some Effect on the People but Mr  Love  seeing into the Design avoided it and would not meddle on the other hand the Persons who brought in the Bill assured the  Dissenters  there was no Design to offer them any Disturbance and that if they desired it they would bring in another Bill afterwards to exempt them from the Penalties of the said Act representing to them at the same time That if they struck in to oppose this Act the Bill against  Popery  would be lost and both they and the Church of  England  should fall together under the growing Mischiefs arising from the Power of  Papists  in the Court  The  Dissenters  prevailed upon with these Arguments and especially depending upon the Promises of the  Churchmen  Unhappy Credulity that the Act had no View towards them and should in no wise be turned upon them acquiesc'd and to save the Church of  England  sacrific'd themselves  and their Posterity to the Ingratitude of those that proposed it to them Just thus the  Dissenters  in  Ireland  suffered themselves to be prevailed upon in the same Case rather than to lose that happy Bill last past there to prevent the Growth of  Popery  into the middle of which a certain Noble Person then in the  Ministry  and lately become a Convert to a  Principle  perfectly new to what he formerly profest thrust into the middle of that Act thereby to throw out all the Faithful Subjects of the Government who spent their Estates and some of their Blood in the Defence of  LondonDerry  against the  Popish  Army of King  James  from being trusted with the Magistracy of the City they defended  In this manner and on this Occasion and no other this Act was passed which is now become so much the Favourite of a Party as to be thought the great Defence of the Church of  England  how and by what Degrees it became so may not be improper to enquire  It was some Years after the first passing of this Act 'ere the Effects of it on the  Dissenters  were much taken notice of and during the first Years afterwards the Capitulation of those Persons who brought it in was pretty well observed And tho' several Persecutions happen'd in that time  upon the  Dissenters  by Virtue of other Penal Laws which were turned against them yet this Part of the Law was not much insisted on till about the Year and when the  Popish  Plot being turn'd into Ridicule and several Plots trumped up upon the  Dissenters  partly to turn the Odium of that Plot upon them and partly to suppress them as a Party joyning with the  Whigs  especially when the Court undertook the modelling of Corporations and brought Writs of  QuoWarranto  against the Charters of Towns Then this Law was turned fullbut upon the  Dissenters  and with all imaginable Eagerness insisted upon even so much as to the CommonCouncil Men of the City of  London  nay they began to talk or offer at allowing no Citizens to Vote for CommonCouncil Men or Aldermen but such as had taken the Sacrament and to run it to all possible Extremities they went this Length That no Man should be allow'd a License to keep an  AleHouse  unless he had taken the Sacrament of the Church and several sad Stories are left upon Record of Persons falling into Despair Melancholy and Madness for having acted against their Consciences in that Case till at last it was said a poor profligate Wretch found out an Expedient for it and finding a Priest with as little Religion as himself  communicated with him professing to take it as no Religious Act for that he owned he was not fit to do it acknowledging himself a Scandalous Sinner but that being forced to do it or lose his License which was his Livelyhood he took it as common Bread and Wine  c  There are other Scandalous Instances of the Severity of those Times which we omit being not willing to aggravate the Grief of those things  By the publick Management of these Times this Act was thus brought on the Stage as if made on purpose for the  Dissenters  while at the same time the  Papists  against whom it had really been made were upon every Occasion forborn conniv'd at and overlook'd and all Attempts to prosecute the Law against them discourag'd and discountenanc'd  This continued during the whole Reign of King  Charles  II and in King  James  's Reign till the Defeat of the Duke of  Monmouth  when the King in his Speech to the Parliament fairly told the House He could not want the Service of the Gentlemen of his own Religion and openly Dispensing with this Law in the  Papists  cajol'd the  Dissenters  with their share of the Liberty  Some of the  Dissenters  it must be allowed were so far partial to their own Ease as not to consider that it was given them at the Expence of the Constitution and that their enjoying the Relaxation of Penal Statutes by the Breath of the King was a stopping their Mouths against the open Breaches of the Law and effectually taking from them any Argument they might use against the Dispensing Power or the pulling down all the Fortifications of our Laws against  Popery  and Arbitrary Government  But their Eyes were soon open'd and they saw the Mistake time enough to joyn heartily with the Church of  England  in restoring the Liberties of their Country and overthrowing the projected Establishment of  Popery  and then followed the  Revolution    During the whole Reign of King  William  the  TestAct  slept in its Native Circumstance its first Design in keeping  Papists  out of Publick Employment out of Parliament Army and Civil List was effectually answer'd But the corrupt turning the Edge upon the  Dissenters  was discountenanc'd as what was  not only  not the Interest of the Nation but as what was not the true Reason or Intent and Meaning of the Bill The King who had a native  Aversion to all Religious Coercion had also the less Inclination to push the Severity of this Law upon the  Dissenters  because he knew in the Original Making that Law it was not in the View either of the People or of the Sovereign to give them the least Disturbance on that Account  Yet here the  Dissenters  committed another Error for as if they were easier in their Compliance in that they were not at all compell'd they voluntarily comply'd with the Law tho' they were sure no Man would meet with Encouragement in prosecuting them for the Omission nor do we find in all this time any Prosecution commenced against any Protestant Dissenter for taking or executing any Office or Place whether Civil or Military without taking the Sacrament  This obtain'd the Name of  Occasional Conformity  but the Freedom with which the  Dissenters  qualified themselves at their entring into such Offices tho' there seem'd no Danger in the Omission gave Offence first to their own Friends especially among those who having a more strict regard to their Principles look'd upon it as an Inconsistency with their professed Dissent from the Church who complained openly that such who could on meer Occasion of Preferment and to shun a Penalty Conform  ought not to be receiv'd again into the Communion of particular Congregations but as Penitents  There were many who took up the Weapons against this Objection and thought to master it with Arguments drawn from General Charity But however they might prove the Legality of a Communion of Charity with all Orthodox Christians or a General Communion with the whole Christian Church yet it is most certain no full Answer could be given to that Part of  Occasional Conformity  which was submitted to by Persons otherwise Dissenting from the Church meerly to quality for Preferment and Places in the Government which was the Sum of the Dispute at that time  This Argument therefore being directly against them became exceeding Popular and especially it appear'd a little new to find the  Dissenters  themselves vigorously Disputing for  Conformity  to that very  Church  which they statedly separated from  No sooner was Her present Majesty come to the Crown but the Enemies of the  Toleration  having as they thought an opportunity to oppress the  Dissenters  began here They found nothing so proper to render them hated and odious to the People as the Charge of Hypocrisy and therefore immediately  took hold of this as an Advantage which offered against the  Dissenters  and that would make their Proceeding against them popular and specious And this introduced the first  Occasional Bill    Now as all Extreams in the unhappy Divisions of this Nation have been fatal to the common Liberty of the whole as well as to the Parties themselves who run unadvisedly into them So here as the  Occcasional Confor  of those  Dissenters  in general who run to the Sacrament in that prophane manner meerly for a Qualification grew scandalous and hateful even to their own Brethren whose Consciences were more strictly obey'd so the absolute restraining the Liberty of Occasional Conforming in all that should enjoy any Publick Employment tying them up from ever Communicating or so much as hearing a Sermon in a  Dissenting Meeting  or indeed in any Foreign Protestant Church on Pain of losing their Employments and Livelyhood this always carry'd with it such an Air of Cruelty such an Invasion of NativeRight such an Oppression of Conscience such a visible Inconsistency with the  Toleration  and such a Degree of  Persecution  that all the moderate Part even of the Church of  England  it self opposed it  How it was first introduced and pass'd the  House of Commons  how it was sent up to the  Lords  for their Concurrence how the  Lords  return'd it but with one Amendment relating to some Circumstances not essential to the Bill and which the Commons would gladly have quitted in their subsequent Attempts and yet how the Commons adhering to their first Bill and the Lords insisting on their Amendment that Bill was lost How the next Session a second Bill was brought in and sent up to the Lords but the Temper of Persecution having lost Ground was thrown out by the Peers by a great Majority And  lastly  how a third Bill was brought into the House of Commons and lost in their own House by the Attempt to Tack it to another Bill and how that Tacking Project not only threw out the Bill but even overthrew the Party that had been all along so forward to promote it These are Things so well known to every Man that has any Concern upon him for the Publick and the Particulars have been made so public that we need do no more than refer the inquiring Readers to the Papers which have been already published on that Occasion  When after this by the late  CourtRevolution  in  England  a new Turn was given to all our Civil Affairs and new Faces appear'd in the Management as the Warmth of the  High Church  Party appear'd in several Extravagancies so unbounded as we had Reason to apprehend that they could be deny'd nothing and knew they would stick at nothing to raise their New Party and effectually crush the Old so it was expected this old Affair should be revived  When we say  expected  'tis needful to add that it was expected by every Party The  High Party  expected it they said one to another That now was the happy Moment when it was in their Power entirely not to establish the Church only but so effectually to crush the Interest of the  Dissenters  as to render it impossible for them ever to rise again at least so as to make themselves formidable to the Church  We might add here what that Party promised themselves from the Restoration of their Friends the Elections having gone generally in their favour how they reduc'd the  Toleration  to such a Pitch that they would no more have it allow'd to be a  Toleration  but an Exemption from the Penalty of certain Laws how the Academies  and Schools of the  Dissenters  were threatened and Prosecutions against some of them actually begun and how in all Places they began to threaten the  Dissenters  with shutting up their MeetingHouses and in many Places rabbl'd pull'd down and burnt their MeetingHouses but this may be referr'd to a more proper Place this may we hope sufficiently prove That the Friends of that Party made no question but that an  Occasional Bill  should be immediately brought in  The  Dissenters  testify'd early their just Apprehensions when in the Hurry of this Change at Court and the coming in of a New Party like a Flood the Insults in their Persons the Injuries in their Houses and Meetings the Abusive Railing Pamphlets and the Tumultuous carrying of all kinds of Elections against common Rules of Modesty and Decency as well as Right made it Rational to them to think that nothing could be so severe but what they had Reason to expect and therefore that an  Occasional Bill  should be Introduc'd into the next Parliament to the Ruin of their Liberty was one of the least Things which they thought it was Reasonable to fear  Even those Gentlemen who tho' willing for other Reasons to join in the Changes at Court were yet of more Moderate Principles  that were willing to have the late Ministry depos'd and admitted the New Ministry as a Means to such other Ends as they had in View whether respecting this or that View yet unconcern'd with any Religious Prospects These tho' they did not approve of the Occasional Bill as what they imagin'd needless to the Church and tending to encrease the Æ²neasinesses of the People which they having settled the New Management of Civil Affairs desir'd to bring to some settled Condition yet it is plain expected the Occasional Bill to be push'd at the last Session and as they expected it so they apply'd themselves to prevent it and as by the Consequence appear'd did prevent it  It will be needless to bring the Complaints of the Hot Men against these last for their fatal Moderation as they call it is an Evidence that these Men of Moderation did effectually stop the Current of that Zeal or Heat call it what you please which would have put forward such a Bill 'Tis enough that the House of Commons governing themselves by Moderate Councils contrary to all the Expectations Hopes or Fears as above offer'd nothing to the Prejudice of the  Dissenters  abridg'd none of their Liberties nor encourag'd any of the Heats without Doors which would have  push'd at the  Dissenters  and the Session pass'd over with a Calmness as exceedingly Mortifying to the Enemies of Peace as perhaps Surprizing to those who had been under Apprehensions of other Usage as above  By this happy Conduct the  Dissenters  began to take Courage Rebuilded their Demolish'd MeetingHouses and promis'd to themselves that as Her Majesty had pass'd Her Royal Word to preserve  Inviolable  their Privileges and Religious Liberty they should enjoy the same notwithstanding the former Fears without any farther Interruption  When on a suddain from a Quarter whence they expected nothing of that kind and from Hands which they well hop'd would as they formerly had been held up in their Favour the Storm seems to be Risen by what ever Influence and with what ever Design rais'd is not for us to Enquire yet but we shall adjourn it with the Words of the Apostle  We have many Things to say but you cannot bear them now  We are now come to that unhappy Time That Crisis when we see the  Dissenters  given up by their Beloved Patriots Attack'd by those who they justly plac'd their Confidence in as the People from whom they expected Protection and as another  Author writes sacrifiz'd to the PartyInterest of those who pretended formerly to espouse them  This we say with Respect to those People who to Congratulate the New Converts that come over to a Party are pleas'd to see themselves ruin'd and the Liberties of their Posterity taken away in Matters both Civil and Consciencious in order to form a Secular Interest and support their Prospects relating to Power Management and Administration We are speaking now of People without Doors for of the Parliament and Proceedings within Doors we may not now discourse  But above all it seems Astonishing to Unbyass'd Judgments to find even the  Dissenters  themselves less Allarm'd at their approaching Bondage than they us'd to be willing to please themselves with Hopes that the Hands that this comes from cannot be suppos'd to hurt them willing to amuse themselves with the Rumour that the Bill now depending is differing from the former and less severe that it is qualified with some Circumstances which makes them amends that it includes a farther Security to the  Tolleration  and the like  Alas poor People When are ye to open your Eyes When will Heaven be pleas'd to restore you to your Understanding  What are you doing If the present Bill is Qualified with some Clauses for your better liking it if the bitter Pill is cover'd with a thin Leaf of glittering Metal if there are not all the severe Things which you were formerly Attack'd with in this Do you derive Comfort from this Or ought you not the rather to see the certainty of what is to come and that your Bondage is made sure to you by the EarnestPeny given you in the Beginning  The present Parliament are perhaps dispos'd to gentle Methods and backward to bring upon you the Weight you were formerly Threatned with and you are pleas'd with the Negative of your Miseries and Thankful that it is no worse  But have you look'd at the Formidable Power of your Enemies without Doors Have you Enquir'd into their New Measures How having as before miscarried in their Attempts on you by the Rash pushing all at once upon the whole of your Destruction they now see their Mistake and are acting wisely with you  Go to let us deal wisely with them  was the Ancient Method of God's Enemies and what is this Wisdom but a gradual Encroachment upon you and gaining by little and little what they would find less likely to prevail in if offer'd at once  Fatal is their Policy to wheedle you in they take hold of your Party Animosities and send over their  Hushai's  to Counterfeit a Revolt to you and to bring in your Easie and Impolitick Leaders into Measures with them at your Cost forming a Party to carry on Temporal Interest at the Expence of your Religious Liberties and thus you are drawn in by the Spies and Cheats of a Party to be Agents in your own Destruction  Poor unhappy blinded People Supinely sitting down pleas'd with the Ruin of your Liberty because it comes from Hands that you think would not hurt you Perhaps those People whom you Rely so steadily upon are your Friends and would not willingly injure you but they are not  Dissenters  their Opinion is not with you so it can be no Point of Conscience to them perhaps they do not see so far into the fatal Consequences of your Oppressions as you may soon have Cause to do and are willing to give up a few Points which they may not be sensible are fatal to your Interest and as this may form a greater Interest for them another Way they think this the lesser Mischief  But is this suitable to the Sincerity of those Pretences these Men have always made of a Disinterested regard to the Concerns of the  Dissenters  Is this according to the Stipulations of the Memorial to the P of  O  Or is not this opening a Door at which the apparent Ruin of the  Tolleration  must infallibly enter It is our Duty to suppose that the  Parliament  has no such View has no Prospect or Intention but to the better Establishing the Interest of the Church and are not desirous of Invading the Tolleration or taking away the Liberties of the  Dissenters  or lessening their Native Rights But is not the restless pursuit of the Ruin of the  Dissenters  at the bottom of their Conduct who prompt these Things without Doors And why do they content themselves with this part of their Design at this time But perhaps because they foresaw they could obtain no more and because they are willing to get up every Step they can towards that intire Dominion over Conscience which they hope to arrive to  It cannot be construed a Reflection upon the Parliament without manifest Injustice to say that others may have Abhorr'd Destructive Prospects in Contriving what these may have no View but the general Good in their Enacting for the Wholesomest Laws have been perverted to the most wicked Purposes as Establishments of Civil Right to Oppression CorporationPrivileges to Monopoly Royal Prerogative  to Tyranny and Church Settlements to Persecution and therefore while we charge the Party who aim at the Ruin of the Toleration to be at the Bottom of every Attack against the  Dissenters  we no more Reproach the Proceedings of the Parliament than when we clear the Parliament of any Evil in such Proceedings we may be said to acquit the Contrivers and Party who promote on all Occasions the Ruin of the  Dissenters  Liberty  That the present Bill depending in the House may be with fewer Restrictions than the last That there may be some Clauses in Favour of the Toleration we cannot say but all this may be true and the Moderation and Justice of the Houses are so far your Safety but are there not Clauses in the same Law which lessen the Liberties which the Act of Toleration either Granted you or which were your Right in Consequence of the Act of Toleration or which are the Native Rights of  EnglishMen  Are there no Clauses which break in upon that Liberty of Conscience which we have so long insisted upon as a Right which no Humane Power ought to Invade Are there no Branches of Persecution in it Are there no Powers given to your Enemies to Insult and Oppress your Consciences Are there no poor Innocent Men who must forego  their Employments and starve their Families or act against Conscience to feed them Are there no innocent People who must be driven from the  Dissenters  to the  Church  meerly for Subsistence Or which is still worse are there no Conscientious  Dissenters  who must now perish and starve because they cannot totally Conform being obliged to quit their Employments because they cannot in meer Conscience comply If none of these Things are in the Bill it is well but if there are Let the  Dissenters  flatter themselves as much they will that those on whose Favour and Judgment they so much depend acquiesce in the Bill Let them please themselves as much as they will in the Negatives of the Bill That this or that which was severe in the late Bill was not in this they will find let this be as mild as it will it is yet so much the nearer to the Persecution which the Party designs 'tis yet a Step forwarder to the approaching Evil that waits behind the slower the Poison the surer the Operation the lingring Consumption is most certain to kill and the  Toleration  which is the Aim of the Party is so much the nearer to its fatal Period  Nor is the Slumber of the  Dissenters  and the Lethargy that is upon them as to this Matter the least of their Danger when they are so divided in Interests heated with Animosities and engaged in Parties that too many among them are willing to give up any thing and fall in with any Body so they can but strengthen the Party Interest they pursue This is a foreboding Signal of the Ruin of their Interest we speak not meerly with respect to the present Heats that rage among us but for several Years past this has been the prevailing Temper  And how else could they now rejoyce in and propose Things to themselves from the seeming Conversion or Revolt or what you will call it of a Person known thro' many Years of Publick Conduct to bear a profess'd Aversion to the  Revolution  to the Person of the King to the whole Body Being and very Name of a  Dissenter  Is it for this Man and his very few Dependents that we are so willing to Sacrifice the Liberties of Two Millions of Her Majesty's Subjects Is it to gain a Man who no Side ever thought capable of Business whose Interest never put an Ounce in the Scale of Parties but who has been the Derision of all Sides and the Contempt even of his  own House Is it for this Man's Favour that a whole Party should deviate from their Ancient Steadiness and give up the Rights and Privileges of their Countrymen  We look upon an Attempt of this Nature to be a Plot upon the  Whigs  in general and their Interest as a Party as well as upon the  Dissenters  and this Plot is to divide them and no doubt but it will have the desir'd Effect For will the  Dissenters  ever trust a  Low Church Whig  again when they find that these have turned upon them in such a manner as this and flattering the other Party put their Hands to such a Work as this smiling to the  Tories  with  JEHÆ² Come see our Zeal for the Church  Could there ever be a more effectual Step to divide the Interest of the Whigs Can one Party ever betray another but it lessens their Confidence one in another for ever after Will a  Dissenter  ever repose his Safety again in the Breast of a  Church Whig  Or will a  Church Whig  ever believe a  Dissenter  can trust him with his Liberty after this And do not the Enemy percieve it  Were there no Man of  Moderation  left among the whole Body to have recourse to to save Us And when did this happen Had  it been when a Majority of  High Flying  Interest had Govern'd in the it might have been expected but when we boasted of the contrary to an Extream to have this Storm arise from that Quarter O  Hominem  O  Mores  Why should any Man wonder That a  Nemine Contradicente  is added to the Accounts we have of the Progress of the Affair we are upon How should it be expected that any one should contradict what those alone who it was always expected should oppose it had consented to do nay and as we are told were the Originals  I had almost said worse  in the Famous Introduction of it into the  It might be expected here that somewhat should be said to the Matter of the present Bill depending But there may be more time for that and a Time more proper  It may suffice at present to speak a little to the General Design of a  Bill  or  Act of Parliament  against  The Occasional Conformity of Dissenters  whether it respects this Bill or no and a little of that  Occasional Conformity  it self as they relate to what has been formerly Transacted in both Houses of Parliament upon that Head  We have not the least View in this to plead for the Occasional Conformity of the Dissenters as it relates to a meer Qualification a Practice which it is manifest few of the Dissenters defend which they are very much come off from and which has done much more Prejudice to the Dissenters themselves than to the Church But it seems absolutely necessary in common Justice to distinguish here between a voluntary ill Practice of a few and a Law to divest the Subject either of his Civil or Religious Right  We find many People who by their constant Practice tho' dissenting in Worship and in many things relating to Discipline ChurchGovernment and Ceremony have yet held it as a Point of Conscience to maintain a Communion of Charity with the Church others tho' they do not choose to Communicate with the Church yet in such Cases where the Law requires it think themselves bound in Conscience  as they are to shew Obedience to the Laws  to comply with that Occasionally which statedly they cannot do these we call  Conscientious Conformers  If these things are meerly Matter of Principle then oppressing these Men must be the highest of  Persecution  which  Persecution  was censur'd in the Preamble to the first Occasional Bill to be  contrary to the Principle of the Christian Religion and the Doctrine  of the Church of  England And it is to be noted here as well worth our Reflection that both the first and second  Occasional Bills  were rejected because they were look'd upon to be a Degree of  Persecution  We cannot but think 'tis always reasonable to distinguish between preventing an evil Practice and taking away a Civil Right and that this is the Case here no Body will dispute  The Dissenters have injury enough in that they are by the Letter of the Law  contrary to the Intent and Meaning of the whole Legislature at the time of its making  excluded from the common Privileges in Society with their FellowSubjects  viz  of serving the Publick and receiving the Reward of their Prince for the Expressions of their Zeal and Loyalty in the publick Service except upon the unhappy Condition of doing that which as Dissenters they may be not supposed capable to do  But to lay so severe an Injunction That if ever they touch any publick Employ they shall never go to hear a Sermon again or to communicate again in a MeetingHouse This is Persecution with a witness to compel to do any thing which is against our Conscience to do otherwise tho' lawful in itself  is Persecution  to restrain from doing what is in it self lawful and we may think  to be Duty to do  is Persecution  and all the Punishment inflicted in these Cases  is Persecution  in the Abstract  It has been so often argu'd that this is no Service to the Church or to the High Party that this Argument seems perfectly useless to be repeated but we cannot but take notice that all the Acts hitherto propos'd have not seem'd to have an Eye to the Church but to the Civil Preferments not to bring the Dissenters over to the Church but to keep them out of the Offices of Profit There lies the true Aim in all this matter and this has been so visible in all the former Practice that it needs little Explanation  Had the Design been purely the bringing the Dissenters over to the Church they would let it alone where it is since nothing is more certain than this that the Occasional Conformity of Dissenters has done more towards bringing all their Posterity into the Church than all the Coecive Laws Penal Statutes or other Violence in the World could ever do and it is most remarkable that generally speaking whereever the Parents have been Occasional Conformists the Children have been total Conformist So that this Liberty taken by the Dissenters has been the Ruin of their Strength the breaking of the principal Families of their Party and the  indifferency of one Age has terminated the dissenting of the next  This the High Church Men are not ignorant of and it is mention'd for this Reason  viz  To prove that were the true Interest of the Church regarded in this Case or at least were that true Interest the End and Design in these things they would entirely let the Dissenters alone But the Design in these things is so far from that is so remote from a Religious View that it all centers in making Parties keeping Posts of Profit and Advantage and if possible keeping the Dissenters out of them and which is yet worse the Aim is at a dividing the Interest of the Whiggs which being link'd to that of the Dissenters has been too formidable for them to deal with but if the Low Church Men can be brought to give up the DissentersWhat then Why they shall have the Honourof what Of being devour'd last and that is all they can promise themselves  And will the Low Church Men give up the Dissenters Will they make a Sacrifice of the Consciences of their Brethren to gain a small Addition to their Party Interest What can be said to them We crave leave to remind them of two or three things  How long do ye think the New Interest you are making will last upon so  ill a Foundation built How far can you go along with the New Converts you are bringing over either they must turn Whigs or you must turn High Flyers The first can never be but by Project and purpose to trick and deceive you and the last can never be but by unaccountable and most judicial Blindness and if these cannot be then you cannot go far together  When they and you part and they go back to their own Party you having in the highest manner provok'd the Dissenters are you able to stand the Ground against Popery and High Flying mad Men by your selves  Remember the time when you were last try'd and consider that two things will suit your present Case That when you were try'd with Popery and Slavery the one from a Popish Prince the other from  French  Maxims of Government what was your Case Were you able to stand your Ground alone were you not sensible of the impossibility of it And when you were sensible of the contrary and made solemn Invitations to the Dissenters to stand by you and join with you did the Dissenters abandon you Did they make their Court to King  James  at your Expence  as it is evident they might have done and were courted by the King to do In short did they serve you then as they are served by you No they resisted all the Caresses of Popery and and PassiveObedience Tories and chose Affliction and Hazard with that very Church of  England  that now are for denying them the least publick Advantage from that Government they have spent their Blood and their Money to support  Are these the Men you will now Sacrifice to the private Views you have of a PartyStrength Are these the Returns to the Dissenters for the putting themselves into your Hands Is this the Temper promised them at the Revolution Is this the Justice to their adhering so vehemently to the personal Interest in the late Changes of those that are now making a Market of them Honest  Coleman  Thou hast lost the most effectual and undisputed Axiom of Political Philosophy that ever was deliver'd at the Gallows  No Trust in Man  The Scriptures concur in it  Rich Men are Vanity and Great Men are a  Lye    Put not your Trust in Princes  Turn we our Eyes up to Heaven from whence cometh Help and as  Zachariah  the Son of  Jehojadah  said when the Rabble stoned him after all the great Things his Father had done for them  The Lord look upon it and require it  Nor can the Spirit of common Discernning forbear to say without Respect or Claim to Prophecies This cannot end but in the sinking of that very Party who by this Treatment of an innocent People seek to Establish their Interest even with the very Men they always abhorr'd They will sink under the Weight of the Party they Caress and this  Egyptian  shall be to them as a Staff which whoever leaneth thereon it shall pierce thro' their Hand and the Deliverance of the Dissenters shall come some other way  But we are told here several Things to buoy us up under the Weight of what we see coming upon us such as these  The Bill now depending in Parliament tho' it may restrain the Occasional Conformity of Dissenters as to Places yet it gives you more than the Equivalent in many Things it confirms the Toleration it restores the Act of Exemption to the Name of the Toleration which it had lost it checks the Jacobites in  Scotland  and it is not extended  in many Things which were included in the former Act  It was brought in from a Prospect of meer Kindness to the Dissenters to prevent the Design of another Party who had projected one tenfold worse and which had been perfectly ruinous to the Dissenters Interest and had in effect turn'd the Toleration out of Doors And both these evidence that the Dissenters are not given up or betray'd or sacrific'd as above  We answer briefly to this that  as before  We are not debating what Favour the Two Houses of Parliament may grant in the Bill now depending It is not for us to say here we are speaking  of  or  to  that Bill or to the Houses of Parliament but we are speaking to those People whom we call  Whigs without Doors  who are concern'd in or agree to bringing any Bill in or putting forward any Law to restrain the Consciences of Innocent Men and take from them at the severe Penalty of the loss of their Employments the Liberty of serving God according to their Consciences If the Parliament have sweetned this bitter Potion with any Negatives with any Favours We are for being thankful for all Favours but We are not to think our selves oblig'd at all to any of those People  if any such are  who having it in their Power to prevent it have put us into the Condition to seek or be glad of such Favours  And let those Favours be what they will if the Clause excluding all those from the Natural Privilege of  Loyal Subjects  and from the Favours of their Sovereign who cannot  how Consciencious soever their Scruples are  Conform to the  Church  We may without Offence say we should not be at all the less thankful to be without the said Favours having but at the same time the Liberty to be without the Grievance  As to what is called  Confirming our Toleration  if we think it sufficiently Confirm'd before and in a most Sacred Manner Establish'd besides the Act of Parliament in the Sanction of Her Majesty's Solemn Promise from the Throne of preserving it  Inviolable  We hope it will not be ill taken if we say We do not see how it can be better Confirm'd tho' every Session of Parliament should pass a New Act in its Favour Nor is our Confidence less in Her Majesty's Sacred Promise than in all the Acts to Confirm our  Toleration  that are or can be pass'd since one Parliament may Repeal what ever Acts another has made  and even their own too  But Her Majesty's Veracity is a Royal Security which we have so much Dependance upon as  we cannot prevail upon our selves to say We desire any further Confirmation of it  That the Parliament in their printed Votes have thrown Dirt in the Face of that condemn'd Impostor  S l  and restor'd the Act for the Liberty of  Dissenters  to the true Title and Denomination of it  viz  a  Toleration    vide  the  Votes Die Lunae Decemb  It is a satisfying Piece of Justice done that Honourable House and what we are bound to acknowledge is like the Righteous Proceedings of so August an Assembly and we should have been larger in owning the Favour did it not come accompany'd with something in the Cover of it which we can by no means without the utmost Hypocrisy be thankful for  viz An Act to restrain the Consciences of Men in the Affair of possessing Offices without renouncing the worshipping God in their own way and according to the Dictates of their Consciences  For this we can no more be thankful than to a Judge who pronounces Sentence of Death against us for Crimes we think our selves not guilty of  That we had as  Dissenters  a Legal  Toleration  before by Act of Parliament is certain That the Act Intitled  An Act to Exempt Her Majesty's Protestant Subjects  c is a  Toleration  is out of all question true  and to prove it The Title to this Act now passing is my Authority being the Words of the Parliament Lords and Commons in whose Name and by whose very Mouths  S l  is thus pronounc'd an Impostor and a Deceiver  We might Address our selves now to speak to the Act it self and examine Two Things in it and which shall be done with Brevity and Modesty  Will this Act answer the End which is pretended in the Title  viz To secure the Church of England  Will it answer the particular View of those who acquiesce in it in hopes of obtaining by it their PartyEnds against the Measures taken for a Peace  Will this Act answer the Two other Ends confirm the  Toleration  and preserve the  Succession  Will it answer the End which is pretended in the Title  viz  To  secure the Church of England  To this I give the Opinion of all those Gentlemen whose Speeches are upon Record against the first and second  OccasionalBill  where it seems manifest at least That it was all their Opinion that this Law would bring no real Addition to the  Church  only serve to keep the Body of  Dissenters  more united And if we might add in this Case that  Æ²nion  may in time be found the only Case in which the  Dissenters  can be formidable to the  Church  The divided Condition of the  Dissenters  their vain Trusts in the  Great Men  who they thought were their  Protectors  their frequent Access to Favours and Fortunes these have all along been the Foundation of their Disasters their Dependance upon  Great Men  elevated them made them secure divided them made them despise Caution and Enemies and made them selfinterested narrow and reserv'd  in short  it bury'd what they call a Publick Spirit among them this lessen'd them in their Real Strength to that Degree that instead of making them Formidable it made them Despicable so that indeed the Liberty and Occasional Conformity of Dissenters has been their Ruin has been the Weakning their Strength Lessening their Numbers and Destroying their Interest and in all these have been  if the Prosperity of the Dissenters is the Churches Danger  a Safety to the Church Now will this Restraint answer the Churches End as it is propos'd It is impossible neither is it Calculated for that End since as is before Noted the Design is not to bring the Dissenters over to the Church but to keep them out of Places But if  alarm'd by this Treatment the Dissenters should more firmly Unite act in Concert recover the Reputation of their Integrity and Sincerity as if they are wise they may they will add weight to their Interest and the End of their mighty Struggle will be quite Defeated  Will it answer the End of those who by it push at breaking the Measures of the Court as to Peace or War  Not in the least  The Interest they had this way is entirely divided by it Mutual Confidence is Destroy'd  Irretrievably Destroy'd  and can never be Restor'd When Men Trust and Confide in one another and then Decieve one another they  seldom  but in Parties and Sets of Men  Never  Trust again they may join Outsides tho' that will be Difficult but Insides Never Now if the Concert is broken which  when whole  could not withstand the Measures above how should they do it when Divided No Strength encreases by being separated  Vis Unita Fortior  is an Old and True Maxim to say  Vis separata Fortior  would be a gross Absurdity Can any one be so weak to think that the Interest of the Whigs and Dissenters which is miserably Torn and Dismembred by this Mystery of Politicks can be able to do that now which they could not do before Where are the Legions  added to their Strength by this New Step Where is the Equivalent they Recieve  Ridiculus Mus  A poor empty unaccompany'd  Hero  Whose Interest has not been able to Draw his own Brethren the Sons of his Mother into his Measures Nay whose Measures Unconcerted and Undetermin'd have hardly amounted to a Clear ProposalWhere are the Preliminaries of this mighty Treaty Truly the Whigs have done as the King of  France  was to do first evacuate the Towns and then let the Confederates make their Demands so they have first evacuated their Friends surrendred the Faith they had Pledg'd to the Dissenters and now the Tories may make their Demands and if it be to give up the Toleration next we do not see how these can deny them so that in short the End is as Uncertain as it was before    Will this Act Confirm the Toleration  Because the House says  it shall  we will not say  it shall not  but God forbid we should say  it will  while we see not the least room for any thing of that Kind This Act and a Hundred more of this Nature being all attended with this Circumstance That they may be Repeal'd by the Breath of the House who gives them Life  As to the Succession being Secured  by excluding a few  Jacobites  out of the  Faculty  at  Edinburgh  where they  are capable of doing little Mischief unless they were likewise excluded out of Commissions of the Peace in  Scotland  where their Power is capable of doing things Fatal to the Succession as may be proved by innumerable Instances We cannot have so much value for that Clause as others have As to  Confirming the Toleration  We will not say that this Act is a direct Breach of the  Toleration  and a most Open Invasion of the Liberties Granted to the Dissenters by the Toleration But we must profess our selves utterly Ignorant of any Discovery to our present Understanding as to any Clause Matter or Thing in it whereby the said Toleration is at all Confirm'd as abovesaid which Ignorance we hope may be Humbly acknowledg'd without Offence  We conclude this with One Only View being the last Resort the Dissenters have and the Alone Help which Humane Power can offer to interpose in this Affair and  This is in Her Majesties Royal Goodness and Compassion  And the Authors of this small Tract beg leave in the Humblest manner with all possible Respect with the utmost sence of Duty in the Name of Her Majesties Loyal but Distressed Protestant Subjects the Dissenters to whom Her Majesty has so often promis'd Her Protection and in whose Zeal  for Her Service Her Majesty has been Graciously pleas'd to express great Satisfaction To represent  That Her Majesty has given Her Royal and Sacred Promise to Them on several Occasions to Preserve their Toleration  Inviolable  Submitting the rest to Her Majesty's Consideration  FINIS
