 THE MEMOIRS OF THE Countess of  BERCI  Taken from the  French  By the Author of the  Female Quixote  In TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  LONDON  Printed for A MILLAR in the  Strand  M DCC LVI  THE HISTORY OF THE Chevalier DES ESSARS AND THE Countess of BERCI  PART I  _IN the Reign of one of the greatest Princes the French Monarchy ever had lived a young Nobleman equally illustrious for his Virtues and the Grandeur of his Descent The Count of  Berci  is the Name I shall give him here His Person was genteel and elegant his Manners soft and insinuating He was in high Esteem for his Valour and his Fidelity to his Master during those Troubles which disturbed the first Years of the Reign of Henry IV acquired him the Esteem of that great King who knew how to distinguish and loved to reward Merit  With such Advantages of Nature and Fortune it will be easily imagined the Count of  Berci  could not be unsuccessful in a wellplaced Passion nor indeed was he suffered to sigh long for the Daughter of the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  whom he demanded in Marriage The Marquis approved of his Addresses and the young Lady gave him her Hand without Reluctance  The Count and Countess of  Berci  passed the first Years of their Marriage in the chaste Pleasures of a tender Union The Count neglected no Opportunity to procure for his Wife all those Amusements which it is natural for Persons of her Sex and Years to be fond of and the Countess on her Side made it her chief Care to merit his Esteem by an exact and prudent Conduct and preserve his Love by her Softness and Attention to please Hymen lavished on this amiable Pair his choicest Favours their Love always tender and sincere was always uniform and constant neither embittered with Jealousy nor palled by any of those Disgusts which too often follow the Possession of what we have most ardently desired  But this Happiness was not to last for ever The Chevalier  des Essars  happened to see the Countess of  Berci  one Evening at the Play to see her and to love her with the most ardent Passion was the same Thing The Chevalier's Birth was noble his Face tho' beautiful to Excess was without Effeminacy  his Person tho' eminently genteel was bold and manly to the frank and easy Manners of a Soldier he joined the polished Elegance of a Court His early Valour had made him remarkable in  Europe  and the following Pages of this History will furnish such amazing Proofs of his Courage as would transcend Belief if the Histories of past Ages had not given Credibility to the Exploits of those Heroes who filled the World with their Glory and their Virtues  The Chevalier  des Essars  was then in his thirtieth Year and the Countess of  Berci  just turned of eighteen Her Stature was tall her Shape easy and delicate her Complexion fine and animated her Eyes were large black and full of Fire all the Features of her Face were regular and charming a thousand nameless Graces were diffused over her whole Form and captivated the Heart of every Beholder Yet this Person lovely as it was was her least Perfection She had a fine Understanding cultivated by Reading and Reflexion a Wit lively and pleasing a noble and generous Mind and a Sweetness in her Manners that secured all those Hearts which the Charms of her Person had first surprised But truly admirable as all these Qualities were it was that unclouded Reason that solid Virtue that noble Fortitude and that blameless Conduct which she constantly maintained even in her greatest Misfortunes and the most dangerous Circumstances of her Life that crowned and gave a Lustre to them all  She was early taught that Beauty when not accompanied by Virtue and the brighter Graces of the Mind could never hope for the Esteem of wise and good Men whose Eyes it only pleased but could not extend its Influence to the Heart and that the greatest personal Advantages if not strengthened by Virtue were the most fatal Gifts that Nature could dispense  The Countess of  Berci  felt all the Force of these Maxims she received and lodged them in her Heart and regulated by them the whole Conduct of her Life and if she at length felt some Sensibility for the Passion of the Chevalier  des Essars  she restrained it within such strict Bounds that it never endangered her Virtue and by her prudent Conduct she changed the most impetuous Man in the World into the most respectful and submissive Lover that ever was  But it is now Time to return to the Chevalier  des Essars  At the first Sight of the Countess of  Berci  her Charms made a deep Impression upon his Heart he was so wholly engrossed by them that he was indifferent to all Things else nor could he give a Moment's Attention to any other Object When the Play was ended he eagerly enquired the Name of that enchanting fair One and was overjoyed to find he might love her without blushing He returned home full of pleasing Anxiety a new and sweet Disorder possest him How altered in a few Hours He was no more that fiery Warrior whose Soul till  then had been accessible to no other Passion but Glory The Image of the Countess of  Berci  took full Possession of his Breast and the Conquest of her Heart was the only Ambition he was now sensible of Oh powerful Love how in a Moment dost thou fix thy Empire in our Souls and suspend or destroy every other Passion  The Chevalier  des Essars  would have rejoiced to find that the Object of his Passion had been single and at Liberty to receive his Vows Her being married was a Circumstance which gave him great Grief and Perplexity he even made some Efforts to vanquish his newborn Love Company Dissipation and the Remonstrances of his Friends might perhaps have rendered those Efforts effectual but he on the contrary delivered himself up to Solitude and conversing only with his own Thoughts his Reason became subjected to his Love he flattered himself that he might love without a Crime his disordered Imagination suggested a thousand vain Chimera's and leaving it to Time and Fortune to make him happy he abandoned himself entirely to the Violence of his Passion Although he had never seen the Countess of  Berci  till that fatal Evening at the Play yet he had some slight Acquaintance with the Count and he conceived that the best Way to get an Introduction to the Wife was to commence a strict Friendship with the Husband And here his Success was answerable to his Wishes The Count of  Berci  thought  it an Honour to be ranked among the particular Friends of the Chevalier  des Essars  and met his Advances with such Eagerness that in a short Time they became inseparable  The Count of  Berci  was continually talking to his Wife of the great Merit of the Chevalier he made one in all their Parties of Pleasure The Countess to please her Lord took all Opportunities of shewing the Respect and Esteem she had for him and the Chevalier at first only discovered a profound Veneration for the Countess but his Passion gaining daily new Force by the frequent Opportunities he had of seeing the lovely Object of it it was with the utmost Difficulty he concealed the Secret of his Heart and weary of the intolerable Restraint he resolved to seize the first favourable Moment to reveal his Love without giving the Count any Suspicion and this Design employed all his Thoughts  In effect it was very difficult to execute but what will not a Lover attempt who lives in the most terrible Uncertainty of his Fate The Chevalier to prevent giving the Count any Suspicions had at first regulated all his Actions his Words and even his Looks with so much Prudence that nothing escaped him in his Presence which could discover his real Sentiments he was neither too free nor too reserved and kept so just a Mean that his Behaviour had not the least Appearance of Artifice or Affectation The Count and Chevalier were always together  and every Day was distinguished with some new Amusement Assemblies Tournaments Running at the Ring each had a Place in this Circle of Pleasures The two Friends were always the Challengers in every Tournament and never failed to give the most shining Proofs of their Valour and Dexterity  In former Times the French Nobility were passionately fond of all those Diversions which at first were instituted in Honour of the Ladies The Prizes which the Victors always received from their Hands was a Spur to their Emulation and early incited them to form themselves for all those Exercises which it became every Nobleman to be skilful in But Tournaments which are natural Representations of Battles however proper they might be to instruct the young Nobility in the military Art were notwithstanding abolished in  France  as being thought too dangerous No one can be ignorant of the fatal Accident that happened to Henry the Second one of our Kings who died of a Wound he received in a Tournament in the forty first Year of his Age and the thirteenth of his Reign Tournaments and Running at the Ring were still in Use in the Times I am speaking of and they were the most splendid and most noble Amusements in the Court of our Kings I hope the Reader will pardon this short Digression the succeeding Part of this History will shew the Necessity of it But let us now return to our noble Friends  The Count of  Berci  had a Taste for Magnificence and Pleasure The Chevalier was always with him either at his House or at some public Diversion after which till the Hour of Supper arrived they amused themselves with walking in some of those enchanting Gardens which constitute one of the chief Pleasures of  Paris  The charming Countess made one in all their Parties The Chevalier would have thought them insipid without her Presence but still no Opportunity offered to speak to her in private In vain he endeavoured to conceal his Torments the soft Languor that appeared in his Eyes when he met those of the Countess gave her some Suspicion of his Passion but the unfortunate Lover gained no Advantage from those Suspicions At length the fatal Flame that preyed upon his Heart began to affect his Health he grew pale and wan a fixed Melancholy appeared in his Countenance and Behaviour  The Count of  Berci  was greatly affected with the Situation in which he saw his Friend  What ails you my dear Chevalier  said he to him one Day when they were walking together  some secret Grief lies heavy upon your Heart Is your Favour at Court declining or does some one of the Beauties that adorn it hold you in her Chains and by her Rigour occasion this strange Alteration in you Speak my dear Chevalier open your Heart freely to me and be assured that my Fidelity in keeping  your Secret will not be less than my Concern for your Misfortunes  The Chevalier was a little disconcerted by this Discourse of his Friend 'My dear Count said he endeavouring to suppress a Sigh which nevertheless would force its Way  how obliging is this tender Anxiety of yours Believe me there are few Evils in Life that would give me much Affliction with such a Friend to alleviate them But indeed I have no Reason to complain of my bad Fortune the King is still pleased to continue his Favour towards me and my Heart hitherto insensible to the Charms of Love has escaped the Chains of any of our Beauties whom I have beheld with an Indifference that preserved my Freedom Ambition is the sole Passion of my Soul and the Desire of acquiring Glory takes up all my Thoughts Ever since our invincible Monarch has been in peaceable Possession of the Throne of his Ancestors the French Nobility have languished in a shameful Inactivity I can no longer bear to lead this inglorious Life and am determined to seek for Laurels in other Countries which I will water with the Blood of our Enemies The Desire of Glory my Friend is the Passion that consumes me hence proceeds that Discontent you have observed in me and that Languor your Tenderness has likewise taken Notice of is caused by a slight Indisposition with which I have been troubled for some Days past  'I am willing to believe you Chevalier' replied the Count  but if there is any Foundation for the Report that now prevails of a Rupture between the King and the Emperor you will not need to go far to seek Occasions of acquiring Glory and of signalising your Valour As for the Indisposition you complain of I am persuaded the Air of the Country will contribute greatly to remove it It is now the most agreeable Season of the Year The Countess and myself intend to set out in a few Days for my Estate of  Beauplan  it is but a few Leagues distant from  Fontainebleau  where the King is at present We will go from Time to Time to pay our Respects to his Majesty and we will endeavour to make your Stay at  Beauplan  so agreeable that you shall be quite freed from your Melancholy Come you must go with us I desire it as a Favour and be assured you cannot give the Countess a more sensible Pleasure she esteems you greatly and the Alteration she has observed in your Health gives her no less Uneasiness than it has done me  The Chevalier eagerly accepted a Proposal so conformable to his Wishes The Count's last Words gave him a sweet Emotion that might have been easily discovered in his Countenance had not the Arrival of the rest of the Company who joined them that Instant concealed it from his Observation The Conversation now became general and during the rest of the Time that they continued walking they spoke  of nothing but the Pleasures and Amusements the Country would afford them  In the mean Time the Chevalier who never since the Commencement of his fatal Passion had had Room to entertain the least Sentiment of Joy resigned himself up to the pleasing Hopes with which the new Proposal of his Friend inspired him He flattered himself that while he continued in the House of his beloved Countess he could not sail of meeting with frequent Opportunities of entertaining her alone in one of which he might assume Courage enough to declare his Passion at least he hoped that the calm Pleasures of the Retirement he was going to would alleviate his Cares Full of these soothing Ideas he set out for  Beauplan  but he soon found that Groves and Meads thick Woods and winding Alleys with the soft Musick of Birds and murmuring Streams were powerful Aids to Love and while they soothed increased his Flame He had likewise vainly hoped that in the  should find his Mistress less engaged  to form their Arrival at the Castle of  Beauplan  all the neighbouring Gentry came to pay their Respects to the Count and his Lady and for fifteen Days there was such a constant Succession of Visitors at the Castle that the Chevalier never found the Countess alone one Moment during that whole Time  The unfortunate Chevalier was now in a worse Situation than he had ever been The  Amusements of the Country had no Charms for him all Company was irksome he sought Solitude and Silence and there without Restraint abandoned himself to the gloomy Reflexions which filled his Soul These frequent Absences giving the Count great Uneasiness he used to go in Search of him and always found him either in the wildest Part of the Forest or in some romantic Cave swallowed up in deep Reflexion with his Eyes fixed on one particular Object which nevertheless he seemed not to regard his Mind being wholly employed upon what passed within it The Count was now convinced that his Friend had disguised the true Situation of his Heart and that the Noise and Tumult of  Paris  were more likely to cure his Disorder than the Privacy of the Country  The Count who neglected nothing which he thought could dissipate his Melancholy obliged him one Day to make one in a Party for the Chace they were to hunt the Stag The Countes  at home with a Brother of  a Youth about twenty Years o  ▪ Madam  de Berci  as soon as she had dined desired her Brother to walk out with her to meet the Hunters in their Return They had already entered a Wood whose dark embowering Shades for ever excluded the Sun and made it look like the eternal Abode of Solitude and Silence She sat down at the Root of a Tree to rest herself a Moment when her Attention was immediately engaged by the Voice of a Person  whom although she did not see she knew to be but at a small Distance from her She rose up instantly and with her Brotherinlaw walked softly towards the Place from whence this Voice seemed to come and being now very near she heard distinctly these Words  Unhappy Wretch what is it thou hopest for Why dost thou waste the miserable Remains of thy Life in this wild Solitude Art thou resolved to die thus obscurely and not have the melancholy Pleasure of letting her for whom thou diest know the Sacrifice thou makest her Ah too lovely Countess added he after a Moment's Pause is it possible that my Eyes have not discovered to you the Flame you have kindled in my Heart Sure if you knew the Torments I suffer your Compassion at least would meet the Wretch you have undone No no I deceive myself your haughty Virtue would suggest to you that I ought to die unpitied and unlamented Wretch that I am dare I avow such Sentiments Is it for me to form such audacious Hopes Is it for me to make such unjust Complaints Ought I not rather to blush at my own Baseness I who seek to violate the sacred Rights of Hospitality and break through all the tender Ties of Friendship Yet alas mine is an involuntary Crime I love and who can resist the Force of that imperious Passion  He rested for some Moments on this Thought which seemed to calm his Sorrow as it palliated his Crime and lessened his own Remorse But again with new Sighs he continued his mournful Soliloquy in this Manner  It is true O adorable Countess that when I first beheld you I was no longer Master of my Heart you triumphed over it in Spite of myself and I am sensible your Power will not cease but with my Life But oh how long will this miserable Life endure unless I assume Courage enough to reveal my Passion Ah you will doubtless punish me for my Temerity yet I am resolved to disclose my fatal Secret and before your Eyes will pierce this unhappy Breast if I am not able to move some Pity in yours  The Countess of  Berci  unwilling to hear more left the Forest with Precipitation It was not difficult for her to discover that she herself was the Subject of those Complaints she had just heard and that it was the Chevalier  des Essars  who had uttered them That unhappy Lover who had with much Difficulty been persuaded to hunt that Day took the first Opportunity that offered to withdraw and was returning to the Castle with a Resolution to discover his Passion to the Countess But the natural Timidity of a Lover restraining him instead of entering he took a Path that carried him from the Castle and following it found himself insensibly at the Entrance of this Wood its Gloominess pleased  him he alighted from his Horse and tying it to a Tree wandered about on Foot a long Time till being tired he threw himself down under the Shade of a large Tree and there gave free Course to his Complaints not imagining that he should be overheard in a Place which seemed to him to be only a sit Recess for Wretches like himself  It is not easy to determine which was most surprised the Countess or her Brotherinlaw This young Lord had till then been absolutely ignorant of the Chevalier's Passion for his Sister and if some slight Suspicions of it had forced their Way into the Mind of the Countess her Virtue never suffered her Thoughts to rest a Moment upon them Although her Innocence was fully proved by the Complaints her Lover had uttered yet she was under great Uneasiness at what had happened Young innocent and unexperienced she knew not what Conduct to observe on so critical an Occasion She could not determine whether it was most eligible to recommend Secresy to her Brotherinlaw or to desire him to reveal to her Husband what he had heard whether she ought to conceal an Affair of such Consequence from the Count or tell him herself what he might possibly learn one Day from his Brother After some Moments Reflexion she believed the Danger equally great whether she was silent or disclosed the Secret and therefore took a Resolution upon the Spot not only to say nothing to her Husband but also to dissemble  her Knowledge of it even to her Brotherinlaw accordingly she pursued her Way to the Castle in a profound Silence and seemed to have understood nothing of what she had heard  But she could not impose upon the young  Berci  he easily penetrated into her Thoughts and knew how to account for her Perplexity He did not love the Chevalier  des Essars  the great Friendship his Brother exprest for him excited his Jealousy and he secretly congratulated himself at first that Fortune had furnished him with a favourable Opportunity to ruin him for ever with his Brother But these were the first Motions of his Mind his natural Generosity prevailed over his Passions and he rejected with Shame the base Thoughts which had involuntarily obtruded themselves upon him  He was apprehensive likewise that if his Brother should be made acquainted with the Sentiments which the Chevalier  des Essars  had avowed it might raise Suspicions injurious to the Honour of his Wife and change that tender Love he had hitherto felt for her and that Confidence he had reposed in her Fidelity into Indifference and Distrust The young Chevalier  de Berci  had a great Esteem for his Sisterinlaw he trembled at the Thoughts of kindling the Flame of Discord between her and her Husband and he loved his Brother too tenderly to inspire him with a Passion so cruel and tormenting as Jealousy  All these Considerations determined him to be silent with respect to what had happened but observing that the Countess continued silent and pensive he spoke to her thus  I am no longer surprised Madam at the terrible Melancholy in which the Chevalier  des Essars  is plunged he is in Love and you are the Object of his Passion And I must needs confess that the extreme Indifference you discover for this unhappy Man astonishes me  'Methinks' replied the Countess with some Emotion  you are not less indiscreet than the Person you speak of If it be true that I am the Object of his Passion as you tell me it is no less true that the Conquest far from flattering my Vanity gives me on the contrary great Uneasiness But that we may no longer have Occasion to talk of the Chevalier  des Essars  and his presumptuous Designs for which I am truly afflicted I conjure you by our mutual Friendship to assist me in finding out the Means of procuring his Departure from  Beauplan  there is nothing I wish with more Ardour than to be freed from his Presence that I may receive no farther Proof of that Extravagance you attribute to him My Virtue is alarmed by the bare Possibility that I may be suspected of giving the least Encouragement to his unhappy Passion and my Honour is sensibly wounded by being the involuntaly Object of it  I am very much concerned Madam replied the young  Berci  that I cannot do you the Service you require of me If I undertake to remove the Chevalier  des Essars  from  Beauplan  he may possibly complain of my Proceedings to my Brother who will doubtless insist upon knowing my Reasons for thus treating a Man who is so dear to him how then shall I avoid disclosing a Secret which for many Reasons it is not fit he should be acquainted with However if you shall judge it proper to write a Letter to the Chevalier such as your own Prudence shall dictate to you I will very willingly take upon myself the Care of getting it safely delivered to him and I am persuaded that honouring you so much as he does and seeing that his Passion is both discovered and contemned he will take a Resolution to banish himself voluntarily from your Presence rather than interrupt your Quiet and the Happiness of your Family  This Expedient was approved by the Countess and she resolved to put it in Execution that very Night They arrived at the Castle without meeting any one but the Hunters were not long after them They entered with joyful Acclamations having taken in that Day's Sport a monstrous Stag The Chevalier  des Essars  was the last that returned home they did not fail to railly him upon his leaving them he got off by saying that he had lost his Way and had not been able to rejoin  the Company Little did he then imagine that the Complaints he had uttered in the Forest at  Beauplan  had reached the Ears of his Mistress and that she was forming such cruel Resolutions against him  The Countess of  Berci  whose Mind was in great Agitation retired to her Apartment sooner than usual and giving Orders to her Attendants that no one should interrupt her she shut herself up in her Closet and abandoned herself to her Reflexions The Adventure of the Forest so dangerous to her Reputation so injurious to her Virtue filled her with Inquietude She dreaded the fatal Consequences that might result from it she reproached her own innocent Self for being the Object of so criminal a Pursuit and detested those Charms which had been capable of inspiring Wishes and of suggesting Hopes destructive to her Fame a Torrent of Tears ran from her fine Eyes and wet that beautiful Breast which was afflicting itself for the Crimes of others not her own  At length she became a little more composed and began to write after many times altering effacing and writing anew she at length finished a Letter and sending for her Brotherinlaw she delivered it to him intreating him to dispose it in such a Manner that the Chevalier  des Essars  might find it that Night in his Chamber without his being able to guess how it came there She recommended it to him in a particular Manner that in copying this anonimous  Letter he should carefully disguise his Hand for she apprehended some dangerous Consequences might ensue if the Chevalier discovered that it was the young  Berci  who had written the Letter  Every Thing was done with as much Expedition and Secresy as she could have wished Supper being served the Countess left her Chamber and seated herself at Table the whole Company except the Chevalier and the Countess was chearful and supped with a good Appetite However they assumed as much Gaiety as possible and both carefully dissembled the uneasy Thoughts which agitated their Souls The Countess tasted by Anticipation the good Effects her Letter was likely to produce and the Chevalier ignorant of the new Torments that Fortune was preparing for him regretted his not having made Use of the favourable Opportunity which the Count's Absence had afforded him to declare his Passion and was resolved not to defer opening his whole Heart to the Countess any longer than the next Day if he should be so happy to find her alone  As soon as the Company broke up the Count as usual attended the Chevalier to his Apartment where after discoursing with him some Time upon indifferent Matters he retired and left him with his Servants whom the Chevalier dismissing when he was undrest approached his Bed and then found the fatal Letter which was conceived in these Words  Fly from this hospitable House which thou hast violated  with thy impure Designs Fly rash and presumptuous Man Heaven has permitted thy impious Thoughts to be disclosed which thou hadst vainly imagined were hid in the inmost Recesses of thy Heart and out of the Depth of a vast Forest amidst the Shades of an eternal Night has brought thy Crime into open Day Unworthy as thou art of the Name of a Gentleman thou hast plotted the Dishonour of the Count of  Berci  thy Friend and not satisfied with having formed Designs against the Innocence of his Wife thou hast the Audacity to resolve upon confessing thy Passion to her a Passion as odious as it is criminal Thy Death had been already the Punishment for thy Crime if thy injured Friend and his Wife both equally outraged had been made acquainted with thy Purpose But if Heaven has permitted that they should be still ignorant of it it is because thou shouldst have Time to reflect upon the Horror of thy Enterprise Fly then instantly from a Place where if thou shouldst happen to be discovered nothing could preserve thee from the Fury of their just Revenge  What a cruel Stroke was this to a tender Lover to have all his Hopes blasted in a Moment and deprived for ever of the Sight of her who was dearer to him than Life Pale trembling and overwhelmed with the deepest Despair he remained for a long Time motionless with his Eyes fixed on the fatal  Letter which he still held in his Hand He could not comprehend by whom it had been written with such an Appearance of Mystery but he knew that he was discovered and that the Complaints he had made that Day in the Forest had been overheard Opprest with Grief he threw himself upon his Bed but Sleep was a stranger to his Eyes In vain he endeavoured to guess the Author of this cruel Letter the Count of  Berci  he knew had not quitted the Chase and it was not probable that that Nobleman would on an Occasion wherein his Honour was so deeply concerned have contented himself with writing in such a Manner Neither was it likely that the Countess was the Author of it He was entirely ignorant of her having been in the Forest and besides the Letter declared that she as well as her Husband had no Suspicion of his Love and his Schemes It was probable therefore that this anonymous Letter had been written by the Count of  Berci  's Brother who had not been of the Party for Hunting The Chevalier had on many Occasions perceived that this young Lord was not his Friend but he could not persuade himself that a Youth like him stimulated by Hatred would have been capable of acting with so much Prudence and Moderation in an Affair which furnished him with an Opportunity of ruining him with the Count his Brother  The more he reflected upon this Letter the greater Uncertainty he found himself in and the more his Trouble increased  But miserable as he knew he should be when deprived of the Sight of his dear Countess yet he resolved to quit the Castle of  Beauplan  immediately he was convinced that since his Passion was discovered by some one in the Family he could not stay longer without exposing the Honour of Madam  de Berci  to Suspicion and that the perpetual Restraint he should be obliged to lay upon himself would subject him to new Torments His Thoughts now were wholly employed upon the Means of departing without giving Umbrage to the Count and how to procure a Moment's Conversation with the Countess the Hope of which was the only Consolation he had in the miserable Condition to which he was reduced  As soon as Day appeared he went himself and wakened one of his Footmen ordering him to prepare to set out for  Fontainebleau  with the utmost Expedition he then wrote a Letter to one of his most intimate Friends at Court intreating him to send him an Answer after the Model he prescribed to him He then directed his Footman to give this Letter into his Friend's own Hands and to bring him his Answer with the utmost Dispatch The Servant returned early the next Morning from  Fontainbleau  with the requested Letter in which the Chevalier's Friend informed him that it was necessary he should come to Court as soon as possible for Reasons of great Importance which he could not confide to any one but himself  In the mean Time the Chevalier wasted all his Moments in contriving Expedients to procure an Interview with the Countess but none of them succeeded she avoided him so carefully and with such apparent Design that he was convinced she not only had discovered his Passion but was likewise the Author of that Letter which had so greatly alarmed him Finding all his Endeavours to speak to the Countess ineffectual he went to the Count's Apartment where as his good Fortune would have it he also found the Countess his Wife He shewed Monsieur  de Berci  the Letter he had received from his Friend and intreated him not to be offended that for some Time he should be obliged to deprive himself of the Pleasure of his Society The Count who tenderly loved the Chevalier  des Essars  was greatly afflicted at this News  You cannot sure said he be so much hurried as to hinder you from giving us at least the Remainder of this Day to prepare for the Grief we shall suffer by losing you besides I have myself received some News from Court which I want to communicate to you and to have your Advice upon  Saying this the Count quitted the Room immediately without waiting for the Chevalier's Answer for the Express that had brought him Letters from  Paris  attended his Orders and by thus leaving him alone with his Wife he himself contributed to satisfy the Wishes of this too tender and unfortunate Lover  The Countess seeing her Husband leave the Room was preparing to follow him excusing herself to the Chevalier on Account of some necessary Orders she had to give but the Chevalier well knowing the Value of an Opportunity which he might probably never meet with again stopt her with a respectful Air and beholding her with Eyes in which the Disorder of his Soul was but too visible  Ah do not fly Madam said he with a trembling Voice grant me one Moment's Audience I have just acquainted the Count with the News that has been brought me from Court but I have received others also from a Person who is extremely dear to me I conjure you Madam do not refuse me the Favour of reading this Letter it will not detain you long  Saying these Words he presented her with the Billet which he suspected she had wrote to him and fixing his Eyes at the same Time attentively upon her Face the Countess who in an Instant perceived the Snare he had laid for her could not constrain herself so far as to conceal her just Indignation from the Chevalier  What Advantage do you expect from your Artifice Monsieur said she what have you dared to hope from this Temerity Can you imagine that I will suffer you to remain at  Beauplan  after the Offence you have been guilty of Be satisfied with my Moderation in not revealing your injurious Designs to my Lord And take Care that by another Attempt which may possibly come to his Knowledge my Honour may not be wounded by the Sacrifice  of your Life to his Resentment  Ah Madam replied the Chevalier throwing himself at her Feet how unjust how rigorous are you I love the Count of  Berci  your Husband with the sincerest Affection and I adore you with such Purity of Sentiments such inviolable Respect that I cannot think either of you ought to be offended at my Passion It is indeed true Madam that what I concealed from you through Fear of your Resentment I freely uttered to the Trees amidst the Gloominess of a Forest that seemed sacred to Solitude and Grief There it was that I indulged my Sorrow by Complaints which I had not the Temerity to wish might come to your Ear But since contrary to my Intentions you have heard them suffer me to confess Madam that if it is a Crime to love an amiable Object with the most respectful Passion I am the most guilty Man in the World Nay more while I confess so freely this Crime if it be one I likewise protest that I can never repent of it Ah Madam how useless are your Threats against my Life I would only preserve it for your Service and I cannot sacrifice it more nobly than to my Love for you But your Honour requires that I should deprive myself of the only Consolation my unhappy Destiny affords me I must live without seeing you that your Quiet may not be disturbed nor your Reputation injured Ah what would not such Motives prevail upon me to do Yes  Madam I will leave you I will reduce myself to the most horrible Despair rather than give you the sl  ghtest Uneasiness b  t do not imagine that I will renounce my Love Alas it is no longer in my Power to do so All I can do is to avoid your Presence that I may adore you without offending you I go then Madam from your Sight yes you shall have this fatal Proof of my Obedience But ah permit me to intreat that softened by such an implicit Submission to your inhuman Commands you may be one Day prevailed upon to recall a miserable Wretch who to please you banished himself from the most delightful Abode he can ever be in in this World  This Speech uttered with those insinuating Charms which always accompany the Discourse of a Lover tender submissive and unhappy made some Impression on the Breast of the Countess but the more she felt herself moved by Words so well calculated to seduce her the more she guarded herself against their dangerous Softness by reflecting upon what she owed to her own Honour and her Husband's Tenderness for her She turned away her Eyes that she might not meet those of the Chevalier whose passionate Glances died her Cheeks with Blushes and gave her a Confusion she wished him not to be sensible of Assuming therefore a calm and serene Air she answered him thus  You ought to know my Character well Monsieur and to believe that my Knowledge of your Merit would make me think the Passion you avow for me an Honour were I at Liberty to accept of it As I am it is injurious to my Virtue and my Fame both which ought to be dear to you if you have really any Tenderness for me You ought to be satisfied with the Esteem your Merit has inspired me with since it is all my Virtue will allow of and never hope that I shall be capable of entertaining any other Sentiments Pursue then Monsieur the Resolution you have taken to leave  Beauplan  which will appear the more necessary when you shall know that young  Berci  was with me in the Forest when you indulged those imprudent Complaints he will doubtless watch your Conduct strictly every thing will appear of Consequence to an interested Observer He is jealous of the Friendship his Brother bears you he may do you bad Offices with him at least he may disclose your Secret young Men though generous are not always discrete  The Countess had but just ended these Words when the Count entered the Chamber with his Brother The Chevalier was grieved that their Conversation was interrupted and both he and the Countess were apprehensive that the young Lord had discovered their Secret However their Suspicions were soon removed The Count taking the Chevalier  aside discovered his own Affairs to him with such unlimited Confidence that he was persuaded he was intirely ignorant of his Whilst they were engaged in this private Conference the Countess acquainted her Brotherinlaw with the Success of her Billet She told him that the Chevalier had resolved to quit  Beauplan  immediately but she took no Notice of his having mentioned his Love to her or that he knew the Billet he had found came from her  The Chevalier felt some Alleviation of his Sorrows by the Confession he had made to the Countess She had indeed given him no Hopes but she had listened to him without Anger He appeared less melancholly than usual the rest of that Day and passed the Night if not in Tranquility yet free from the dreadful Inquietude which his Doubts about that fatal Letter had occasioned The next Day after taking a tender Leave of the Count and Countess he set out for the Court His Mind being wholly employed upon the Gentleness and Moderation with which Madam  de Berci  had listened to the Confession he made her of his Passion he rode with great Swiftness contrary to the general Practice of Lovers who move slowly and with Regret from the Place where they have left the Object of their Tenderness and fortunately as it proved for him he arrived before Night at the Entrance of the Forest of  Fontainebleau  Scarce had he rode a few Paces in it when by the Report of some Pistols that were fired and the Cries that reached his Ears he judged that some Persons were attacked by Robbers in that Wood and that they were not at any great Distance All the Attendants he had with him were a Valet de Chambre and two Footmen but had he been alone he had too much Courage to have gone back He rode on then with an Intrepidity natural to him and directing his Course to the Place from whence the Noise proceeded he saw a single Man environed by ten Robbers who were upon the Point of assassinating him These Wretches had already killed two of his Attendants and dispersed three others who sought their Safety in Flight The Man that was left defended himself desperately and knowing that he could not escape Death he resolved to sell his Life dear He had already got rid of two of the Robbers with his Pistols and supporting himself against the Trunk of a large Tree he parried with his Sword as well as he could the Strokes that these Villains aimed at him  The Chevalier  des Essars  transported with Rage at this Sight fired his Pistols at the Robbers and did some Execution he afterwards rushed in among them being mounted upon a vigorous Horse and pierced with his Sword all who opposed his Passage His Pistols laid two of these Assassins upon the Earth his Horse threw down another who fell at his Feet and his Sword delivered him from a fourth  The rest of these wicked Wretches seeing the Ground covered with their dead and wounded Comrades were seized with Terror and believing the whole Marecha  ss  e was at their Heels they disappeared in an Instant and took Shelter in the deepest Recesses of the Forest leaving the Field of Battle free to the intrepid Chevalier  des Essars  After this bloody Combat he approached the Gentleman whom he had relieved and was charmed to see in a Person whose white Hairs shewed that he was full of Years all the Fire and Activity of Youth He was struck with a reverential Awe at the Majesty which appeared in his Countenance and saluting him in a most respectful Manner enquired if he was wounded and offered him his best Services  Generous Unknown replied the old Gentleman my Wounds I believe are but inconsiderable to your Valour and the speedy Relief you brought me I owe the Preservation of my Life but I am very much concerned for the Loss of my Servants who are all either dead or dispersed  As for the former replied the Chevalier they have died like Men of Honour the others who so basely abandoned you are not worthy of your Cares nevertheless they are so near the Court whither I suppose your Journey was to terminate that they cannot be in any Danger  I was indeed going to Court answered the old Gentleman but I did not design to continue there any considerable  Time It is long since my Age and the Charms of a Country Life have forced me from that honourable Captivity But Monsieur let us I conjure you see whether these two faithful Servants whom with Grief I saw fall in my Defence have any Occasion for our Assistance  The Chevalier's Servants had already alighted and were busy about the two Men who they found still breathed although they were dangerously wounded in many Places With great Difficulty they restored them to their Senses and then hollowing to the rest of the old Gentleman's Servants who had fled their Voices favoured by the Silence of the Night resounded through the Forest and reached the Ears of those terrified Men who hearing themselves called by their Names began to lose Part of their Fears and they returned to their Master whom they could not behold without Confusion After having bound up his Wounds they applied themselves to relieve their Comrades who were in much greater Danger and seating them upon Horses they mounted behind and supported them and in this Manner pursued the Road to  Fontainebleau  During this Journey the Chevalier  des Essars  addressed himself to the old Gentleman and apologising for his Curiosity intreated him to let him know who it was he had had the good Fortune to assist  I am too much obliged to your Valour Monsieur replied the old Gentleman not to seize eagerly  this Occasion of gratifying your Wishes I will not only tell you my Name and Quality but I will give you an Account of my Adventures The Life which you have so lately preserved is a Benefit I hold from your Generosity and all the Moments which for the future I shall enjoy ought to be devoted to you Happy if the grateful Sense I have of what you have done for me will not be unacceptable but happier still if Fortune will be favourable to my most ardent Wishes and afford me the Means of serving you and of giving you some striking Proof of my Gratitude  The Chevalier returned Answers full of Respect to these obliging Expressions and intreated the old Gentleman to begin his Recital and give him a more perfect Knowledge of a Person for whom he already felt so much Esteem Accordingly the old Gentleman began thus  I was born in the Province of  Burgundy  I am called the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  great Part of my Life has been spent in the Field in the Service of my Country and Religion and there have been few memorable Actions that have past in my Time which I have not been a Witness of I was wounded in that fatal Battle in which  Don John of Austria  and the  Venetians  died the Sea of the  Levant  with  Ottoman  Blood After having served a long Time in foreign Countries I returned to  France  I made my last Campaigns in those fatal Civil Wars  where Citizens blinded by a false Zeal dipped their impious Hands in the Blood of their FellowCitizens and thought it for the Glory of Religion to attack the Lives of their Countrymen with a savage Fury Deplorable Times when the Subject thought he was doing an acceptable Service insolently to take up Arms against his lawful King  I am speaking Monsieur of the last Rebellions in  France  against that generous Monarch so dear at present to the very People who once so eagerly opposed him A Prince whose Goodness Courage and Glory will live eternally in the Annals of our History I had the Honour to fight near him in the celebrated Battle of  Ivry  the Event of which was to seat him upon the Throne or to exclude him from it for ever His Forces were greatly inferiour to those of his Enemies but  Henry  whose Person alone was worth a whole Army formed himself the Plan of the Battle was present in every Part animated all and exposed himself like a common Soldier to every Danger Before he ordered the Signal to be given for sounding the Charge he spoke these few Words to his Soldiers with that majestick Sweetness which gained him every Heart  Friends  said he  you are French Men I am your King and there is the Enemy  This noble and Iaconick Speech inspired us with Courage and excited a general Emulation We gained a  complete Victory which was followed by many other great Advantages The Reduction of  Mante  and  Vernon  which were brought under the Obedience of their lawful Sovereign put him in Possession of all the Bridges of the  Seine  that lay between  Paris  and  Rouen  We afterwards made ourselves Masters of all the Towns in the Neighbourhood of  Paris  The Siege of that great Capital which was reduced to the last Extremity having been raised by the King in Compassion to the unhappy  Parisians  and failing in our Attempt to get Possession of it by Stratagem we invested and took  Chartres  in a most rigorous Season At length this great Prince who had caused himself to be instructed in the Principles of the Catholick Religion became sensible of the Errors of his own and performed his Abjuration at the Abbey of  Saint Dennis  with all the Formalities in use in such Ceremonies From that happy Day the Party of the League sunk insensibly and our great Monarch by this wise and prudent Step which was neither influenced by Interest nor Fear saw himself in the peaceable Possession of a Throne which was his lawful Inheritance and which he held but from God alone  These were the last Campaigns in which I served The whole Kingdom submitting to  Henry the Great  I resolved to make a a Visit to my paternal Estate Love was  the Cause of my settling there I was weary of the tumultuous Life of a Soldier the calm Pleasures I tasted in the Country made me desirous of Privacy and Retirement and my Passion for Madam  de SaintSauveur  whom I happened to see at the House of a neighbouring Gentleman whom I went to visit confirmed me in my Resolution to quit the Court and to pass the Remainder of my Life in  Burgundy  my native Province I married her in the Course of two Years she brought me a Son and a Daughter My Son is at present at Court and my Daughter was married about three Years ago to a Nobleman called the Count of  Berci  who is now at a Castle of his half a Day's Journey from hence I quitted my Retreat to come and visit my Children whom I passionately longed to see and was wholly intent upon the Pleasure of embracing my dear Son whom I proposed to visit first when at the Entrance of this Forest I was set upon by a Band of Robbers and should have doubtless lost my Life by their Hands but for the seasonable Succour you brought me  Such Monsieur is the History of my Life and Fortunes which I have given you in a few Words but brave Unknown added the old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  I expect that you will gratify my Impatience to know who has so lately exposed his Life yet fresh and blooming to save the poor Remains of mine  The Chevalier  des Essars  was equally surprized and pleased at what he had heard a secret Joy took Possession of his Soul and a hundred Times he blest his good Fortune that the Forest of  Fontainebleau  had afforded him an Opportunity of saving the Life of his Mistress's Father He might have made himself known to the Marquis of  SaintSauveur  not only without Danger of any disagreeable Consequence but also with an Increase of Satisfaction to the old Man who would have been charmed to hear that this Preserver was the intimate Friend of the Count of  Berci  his Soninlaw yet through an Excess of Delicacy which few would have been capable of he chose rather to conceal his Name He flattered himself that when the Countess should know that the Life of her Father had been preserved by him and that by concealing his Name he gave a convincing Proof that he sought not any Acknowledgement from her for such a Service she would be as much pleased with his Discretion and Modesty as with his Courage  Having taken his Resolution therefore he answered the old Marquis in this Manner  I am but a private Man Monsieur and so little known in the World that if I should tell you my Name you would know it no better than you do my Person I have only the Honour to inform you that this Day I passed by the Castle of  Beauplan  where the Count of  Berci  is at present I heard that he was in good Health as is  likewise the Countess your Daughter and the high Reputation they have among all the neighbouring Gentry for their many great and amiable Virtues makes me think myself happy to have served them in the Person of a Gentleman of your Rank and so deservedly dear to them  The Chevalier's Precaution was of no Use to him his Valet de Chambre who knew not that his Master had any Reasons for concealing his Name had discovered it before to one of the Marquis's Attendants but when he found by his Master's Discourse that he had a Design to keep himself unknown he was concerned at what he had done and intreated the Servant to whom he had been so communicative not to repeat what he had said In the mean Time the Marquis and the Chevalier continued their Journey to  Fontainebleau  during which the Marquis had often but in vain urged his Preserver to disclose his Name and Condition  The Court was so full that no Lodgings could be procured except one Apartment which the Chevalier obliged the Marquis to accommodate himself with and he went to the House of Monsieur  de Morigny  his Friend This young Lord gave him a most obliging Reception and the Chevalier as soon as they sat down to Supper relating the Adventures which had happened to the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  in the Forest of  Fontainebleau  Monsieur  de Morigny  asked him if he knew the  Son of that Marquis who was now at Court  I have never seen him replied the Chevalier but I have heard great Praises of his Courage  He is one of the bravest young Men in  France  resumed Monsieur  de Morigny  we performed our Exercises together at  Paris  we were hardly ever asunder during our Travels through  Italy  and till within these few Days we have lived in the strictest Intimacy and Friendship but there is a great Coldness between us at present and I believe it will not be long before we shall break altogether with each other  I am sorry for it answered the Chevalier but is it impossible to effect a Reconciliation between you  It will be a very difficult Thing returned Monsieur  de Morigny  since it is Love that has disunited us We are both enamoured of one Lady and neither of us are disposed to yield up our Pretentions However if he had first addressed the Lady my Friendship for him would have induced me to make an Effort to subdue my Passion but since I saw and loved her first I expect he should make a Sacrifice such as I would do in his Situation I spoke to him to this Purpose this Evening as we both came away together from Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  for that is the Name of the young Lady we love I know not how he received what I said but I explained myself in a Manner sufficiently intelligible and it is not my Fault if he did not understand my Meaning  The Chevalier was extremely afflicted at this Discourse he foresaw that if these Friends should have a Duel during his Stay at  Fontainebleau  he should be obliged according to the Rules of that false Notion of Honour which then prevailed in  France  to offer himself as a Second to Monsieur  de Morigny  He was not deceived in his Conjecture Monsieur  de Morigny  was scarce awake the next Morning when a Gentleman desired Admittance to him he ordered him to be shewn immediately into his Apartment after the first Civilities the Gentleman told him that the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  desired to see him immediately with his Sword in his Hand to give him Satisfaction for the injurious Treatment he had received from him the Evening before the Gentleman added that the Marquis had done him the Honour to chuse him for his Second and therefore he intreated him to fix upon one of his Friends for the same Service  Monsieur replied  Morigny  with great Composure I am ready to give your Friend the Satisfaction he demands but I will have no Second and I know you are a Man of so much Honour that upon the Security of your Word I will go alone to meet my Adversary  I expected such an Answer from one of your Courage and Generosity replied the Gentleman and in the same Circumstances I would make such a one myself but you doubtless know better than I that Custom in this Place gives the Law to Reason The  Business of Seconds is to be Witnesses of the Conduct of their Friends not to fight themselves but the contrary has obtained by long Use and you and I are too young to establish new Laws I entreat you then Monsieur to employ some one of your Friends upon this Occasion or permit me to tell the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  that you refuse to give him the ordinary Means of Satisfaction  Monsieur  de Morigny  was going to make the Gentleman some Answer when the Chevalier  des Essars  suddenly entered the Room he had heard that some Person had enquired for Monsieur  de Morigny  and judging by the Discourse he had with him the Evening before that the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  would infallibly send a Challenge the next Morning he rose hastily and wrapping his Nightgown about him slipped into a Place from whence he could overhear their Conversation He rushed into the Room upon hearing the Gentleman say these last Words  What is the Matter Gentlemen said he you seem to be disputing some Point is there no way to bring you to an Accommodation I have thought added he without giving them Time to reply of an Expedient to put an End to your Contest for I suspect the Design Monsieur that brought you here I declare then that if Monsieur  de Morigny  will not accept the Challenge with the Conditions you bring him I offer to take it upon myself and will attend your Call whenever  you please  You are too generous my dear Chevalier said Monsieur  de Morigny  embracing him and since you will have it so let us dress ourselves instantly and meet the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  at the Place appointed  It was with infinite Pain and Regret that the Chevalier took this Step no Quarrel of his own had ever given him so much Uneasiness He was under terrible Apprehensions that by it he should ruin himself with the old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and the Count of  Berci  his Friend He was preparing to assist Monsieur  de Morigny  against the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  at the Hazard of all the fatal Consequences that might result from this Combat But these Considerations were weak compared to that of incurring the Displeasure of his dear Countess He had Reason to expect that she would be highly incensed against him yet terrible as this Thought was that Notion of false Honour to which the bravest Men were Slaves at that Time made him resolve at the Expence of all that was dear to him to comply with it Unjust and cruel Law which reasonable Men imposed upon themselves Those destructive Maxims cannot be rejected with too much Horror nor can their Influence during that miserable Period be too highly lamented Every Day teemed with the Fates of some brave Youths who wantonly sacrificed each other's Lives in support of a Quarrel wherein they had no Part and which they had heard  of but a few Moments before This Madness they carried still farther a Man would have thought himself injured and have publickly complained of the Injustice that was done him if on such an Occasion his Friend had not made choice of him for his Second and if it happened that he was informed of the Dispute he would with the utmost Eagerness run to offer his Arm to revenge the often imaginary Wrong It very frequently happened that the Adversary to whom he was to be opposed was one of his in  mate Friends yet it would have been dishonourable if he had scrupled on these glorious Occasions to have deprived him of Life We cannot give too many Praises to that Prince truly worthy of the Name of Great who by wise Edicts supported by illustrious Examples of a salutary Rigour at length suppressed this savage Gallantry which every Day carried off some of the Flower of his Nobility and the bravest Men in his Kingdom But let us resume the Thread of our History and see what passed at the House of Monsieur  de Morigny  As soon as it was determined there that they should fight two against two the Chevalier  des Essars  and Monsieur  de Morigny  drest themselves in haste and were conducted by the Gentleman into one of the most private Parts of the Forest of  Fontainebleau  where they found the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  waiting for them on Horseback They all dismounted in an Instant and stripping themselves to their Shirts the Chevalier  des  Essars  and the Gentleman left the young Marquis  de Saint Sauveur  and Monsieur  de Morigny  to terminate their real Dispute while they went to put an End to their imaginary one However they assaulted each other with no less Fury than the two others and after both had made several Passes without Success they closed and each received a Wound from his Adversary The Chevalier passed his Sword through the Gentleman's right Thigh and was himself wounded at the same Time in the left Arm The Gentleman no longer able to stand fell upon the Ground and the Chevalier  des Essars  too generous to take Advantage of his good Fortune and having not the least Design to terminate by the Death of his Adversary the Combat which was now become unequal spoke to him in these Terms  Let us put an End Monsieur to a Dispute which began on our Friend's Account we have no Reason to hate each other Take my Advice let us content ourselves with the Blood we have mutually shed and do you permit me to go and endeavour to separate two Men whom a Trifle has made Enemies  He quitted the Gentleman that Instant without waiting for his Answer and ran eagerly to the two Rivals who had both given and received several Wounds But in the Moment as he was advancing towards them the Sword of the young Marquis by  a Stroke of his Enemy's broke in the Middle The unfortunate Youth seeing the Chevalier  des Essars  approach alone with his Sword drawn and bloody did not doubt but that he had killed his Friend and was come to the Assistance of Monsieur  de Morigny  But not suffering these Apprehensions to appear he redoubled his Efforts although he had now nothing but a broken Sword to defend himself with and resolved to sell his Life dearly But the Chevalier  des Essars  throwing himself between the Combatants intreated them to stop a Moment and listen to him  You are both brave said he neither has had any Advantage over the other but what Chance not superiour Skill or Strength has given I therefore conjure you Gentlemen to remember your former Friendship once so tender and sincere and do not rashly sacrifice it to so slight a Difference as yours is Can you refuse to grant this Favour to two Friends who have so lately exposed their Lives and shed their Blood for you  Well Marquis said Monsieur  de Morigny  will you not now confess yourself vanquished when with only a broken Sword you have the Chevalier  des Essars  and me also to oppose  No answered the brave Marquis  de SaintSauveur  with a generous Indignation I am not vanquished do not flatter yourselves that you have this Advantage over me you  are indeed Masters of my Life Fortune has delivered it into your Hands but you cannot take my Courage from me although I am deprived of the Means of defending myself  Live then replied Monsieur  de Morigny  charmed with the young Marquis's Courage and noble Contempt of Death live unconquered and invincible the poor Advantage I have gained I owe only to Fortune I claim no Triumph from it and all I contest for is that I may not be overcome in Virtue and Generosity  Ah my dear  Morigny  replied the young Marquis I now acknowledge you have truly vanquished me when with such Greatness of Soul you give me a Life which you might have deprived me of without Shame and Injustice but which my Courage would never have suffered me to ask for Yes dear  Morigny  my Eyes are opened in thee I no longer behold a Rival and an Enemy but see with Joy a virtuous and magnanimous Friend My Heart softened by thy Generosity resigns for ever its Hatred and Desire of Revenge Suffer me then with this tender and sincere Embrace to assure you that I have the highest Esteem for your Virtues and the utmost Gratitude for the Kindness you have shewn me  Saying this he threw away his broken Sword and ran into the Arms of Monsieur  de Morigny  They continued a long Time in a strict Embrace and reciprocally conjured each other to forget they had ever had any Difference  vowing a perpetual Friendship for the future which no Consideration whatever should have Power to break  The Marquis  de SaintSauveur  then enquiring of Monsieur  de Morigny  the Name of his generous Friend he turned to the Chevalier  des Essars  and politely thanked him for the Generosity he had shewn him and which he had not merited intreating him in the most obliging Terms to grant him the Honour of his Friendship The Chevalier met these Advances of the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  with a Politeness full of Modesty and Respect he embraced him tenderly and they both vowed an eternal Friendshp  Mean Time the Chevalier  des Essars  lost a great deal of Blood but the Friend of the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  lost much more that Gentleman was so weakened by his Wound and the great Effusion of Blood from it that he had not been able to rise They all ran to the Place where the Chevalier  des Essars  had left him and found him more sensible of his Misfortune in not having been able to follow the Chevalier than of the Pain of his Wound But when he was informed of the happy Event of the Combat between his Friend and Monsieur  de Morigny  he congratulated them both with a sincere Joy  The whole Court was already informed of this Duel The Challenge had not been sent  with such Secresy but Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  who was the Occasion of it had Notice of it a few Moments afterwards Several of the young Lords of the Court to whom she had communicated the Affair mounted immediately to go in Search of the Rivals and to separate them but not knowing the Spot they had chosen to decide their Quarrel they wandered about a long Time in the Forest and did not find them till the Combat was over The first that discovered them were the Friends of the Gentleman who had been wounded in the Thigh they caused a Handlitter to be made immediately with some Branches they broke off the Trees and carried him to  Fontainebleau  The Marquis  de SaintSauveur  earnestly recommended him to the Care of his Attendants and took Leave of him with great Tenderness expressing the utmost Concern for his Wound and then mounting his Horse he joined the Chevalier  des Essar  and Monsieur  de Morigny  and they rode all together after renewing their Protestations of an inviolable Friendship for the Future Monsieur  de Morigny  and the Chevalier  des Essars  took the Road to  Paris  and the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  that which led to the Castle of his Brotherinlaw the Count of  Berci  for their Combat had made it dangerous for them to return to  Fontainebleau  The old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  who had risen very early that Morning to visit his wounded Servants was informed by one of his Footman of the Duel fought by his Son  which already made a great Noise at  Fontainebleau  He sent immediately to his Son's Lodgings to be more particularly informed and his Messenger was told that the young Lord went out very early in the Morning with three other Gentlemen on Horseback with an Intention as it was supposed to fight and that several of the Courtiers had mounted their Horses and were gone to separate them This News filled the old Man with the most dreadful Alarms he mounted a Horse that Instant and galloped after them and soon met the Men who carried the wounded Gentleman from whom he was informed of the Event of the Combat The good old Man then returned to  Fontainebleau  and after recommending his Servants to the Care of the Surgeons he took the Road to the Castle of  Beauplan  whither he did not doubt his Son had retired His Eagerness to see him and be assured that he was not dangerously hurt made him use such Speed that the young Lord was still in the Embraces of the Count and Countess of  Berci  when he arrived  The Countess and her Brother felt very different Sentiments at the Sight of their Father hers was all Joy and Tenderness his Surprize and Confusion After the old Marquis had embraced his Soninlaw and his Daughter the young Marquis approached to pay his Duty to him and was received with equal Tenderness as the others the good old  Gentleman seeming not to perceive that he had his Arm in a Scarf but as soon as they were all seated at Table the Countess of  Berci  observed it for the first Time  Certainly said she you have some Reasons which you are unwilling to own for wearing this Scarf I cannot believe you carry it in Triumph as a Favour from a Mistress but rather that you are obliged through Necessity to wear it I beg you will explain this Mystery to me it has an Appearance that gives me great Inquietude  I own to you Sister replied the young Marquis that I am obliged to wear this Scarf on Account of a violent Pain I feel in my Arm but it is not dangerous therefore do not be uneasy about it  I know Son said the old Marquis that your Arm gives you some Pain but pray tell the true Cause of it to your Sister I shall raise another Quarrel between you and a Gentleman I met in the Forest of  Fontainebleau  to Day if you relate the Affair differently from what he told it  The young Marquis blushed at these Words and not doubting but that his Father was fully informed of the whole Affair he related it to his Brotherinlaw and his Sister very succinctly praising particularly the Generosity of Monsieur  de Morigny  's Second who he said had saved his Life in the very Moment that his Sword was broken in his Hand and he owned that he could not have avoided Death if that brave  Man had not eagerly thrown himself between him and his Adversary  The young Marquis was about to tell the Name of his Deliverer when he stopt through Respect perceiving his Father was going to speak  Son said the old Gentleman you have to Day had a very narrow Escape let me advise you never to tempt an unnecessary Danger there are Accidents enough which happen in the World by which the Life of a brave Man may be shortened there is no Occasion to seek Death he comes too often unexpected and undesired Your Rashness was the Cause of your Danger this Day but that which I escaped Yesterday was the meer Effect of ill Fortune I was attacked in the Forest of  Fontainebleau  by a Band of Robbers who wounded two of my most faithful Servants and put the rest to Flight I could not have avoided sinking under their Strokes but for an Assistance more than human I think which was brought me when my Strength had almost wholly forsaken me a Gentleman on Horseback came to my Relief when I despaired of Safety he appeared like the avenging Thunder of Heaven he either overthrew or dispersed all my Enemies in a few Moments I could not view him plainly because it was almost dark but he had the Air and Port of a Hero as well as the Valour and Courage of one but his Modesty exceeded every thing I ever met with I could not help being  grieved at it because it robbed me of the pleasing Satisfaction of knowing to whom I was obliged for my Life however he answered my Enquiries with Excuses so polite and with such a graceful Sweetness that I durst not take the Liberty to press him any farther I thought I should have failed in Respect and Gratitude if I had urged him to reveal a Secret which he doubtless had Reasons for concealing from me  At these Words one of the old Marquis's Servants who waited at his Chair stepping a little forward said  Monsieur the Gentleman who came to your Assistance in the Wood is called the Chevalier  des Essars  his Valet de Chambre told it me Yesterday as we pursued our Journey after the Combat and he added that he had left this Castle the same Day but hearing his Master make you Excuses for not telling his Name he earnestly intreated me not to mention to you what he had told me I likewise believe that he is the same Person who fought this Morning with the Gentleman we met in the Forest for I heard it said that his Adversary came to  Fontainebleau  but last Night  The young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  was the only Person present who could clear up a Mystery which perplexed every one else He accordingly declared that the valiant Man to whom both his Father and himself owed the  Preservation of their Lives was the Chevalier  des Essars  A general Astonishment seized the Company all were eager to give the Chevalier's Valour and Modesty the Praises so justly due The Satisfaction and Joy which the Countess of  Berci  felt at this News was silent but not less sincere She was afraid of indulging herself in any Expressions of it lest she should give Cause of Suspicion to her Brotherin law This young Man kept a profound Silence and seemed unwilling to give the Chevalier's Virtues that Tribute of just Praise which every other Person allowed him The Company observed his Uneasiness the Effect of a mean and malicious Envy It is the Quality of that unjust Passion when it cannot blacken a superiour and generallyacknowledged Merit to give Pain and Grief to its Owner at the Applauses with which it is honoured The Countess in her Heart set a just Value upon the Services her Family had received from the Chevalier  des Essars  she praised him cautiously but inwardly acknowledged that a Lover so brave and generous deserved her most tender Esteem  The old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  remained fifteen Days at  Beauplan  after which he returned with his Son to  Fontainebleau  He found his two Servants dead of their Wounds which gave him a very sensible Grief The Chevalier  des Essars  and Monsieur  de Morigny  being but slightly wounded soon recovered their Health as also the young Marquis  de  SaintSauveur  and his Second But Love which raged with a cruel Violence in the Heart of the wretched Chevalier poisoned all his Joys and made Glory itself tasteless to him  Absence that Remedy so often successful in Love rendered the Chevalier's Passion more ardent He was not able to taste any Pleasure while he remained banished from  Beauplan  the Idea of the Countess of  Berci  pursued him every where A Lover less respectful than himself after having been so happy as to render two such signal Services to the Father and Brother of his Mistress would not have hesitated to have presented himself before her But awed by her Commands to the contrary he rather chose to pine in Absence and fall a Victim to the Torments that consumed him than offend her He was likewise apprehensive that the two Marquises  de SaintSauveur  were still at  Beauplan  but it was the Presence of young  Berci  which he dreaded more than that of any other He knew he was acquainted with his Passion for the Countess his Sisterinlaw he trembled at the Thoughts of such an interested Observer as he would prove he could not hope for an Opportunity of entertaining the Countess amidst such a crowd of Relations and Friends So many Obstacles were not capable of damping one Moment the Ardour of his Passion His Impatience to see the charming Countess increased with the Difficulties of gratifying it  yet he determined to stay at  Paris  till he had by a Letter demanded her Permission to wait on her at  Beauplan  and he fixed upon one of his Servants whose Fidelity he had often experienced to be the Bearer of it  During the Time that the Chevalier had resided with the Count he became acquainted with a Woman who lived in a Village at a small Distance from the Castle He foresaw that he might one Day have Occasion for her Assistance in his Passion and by rich Presents he had entirely secured her in his Interest He was too prudent and had too much Respect for the Countess of  Berci  to make her the Confidant of his Love for that Lady therefore he told her that he was fond of one of her Women whose Name was  Marianne  This Girl was greatly beloved by the Countess and entirely possessed her Confidence The Chevalier had gained her by the same Methods as the CountryWoman and she had promised him to deliver his Letters to her Lady The Chevalier wrote to the Countess with a trembling Hand and a Heart agitated by a thousand Fears He gave the Letter to his Servant with full Instructions how to act ordering him above all Things not to go to  Beauplan  till it was Night and to set out again from thence at the first Dawn of Day  This faithful Domestick executed his Master's Orders with the utmost Exactness He delivered the Letter to the Woman it was  inclosed in a Cover directed to  Marianne  he likewise gave her two Chains of Gold from his Master one for  Marianne  and the other for herself in reward of her Fidelity The next Day the CountryWoman after locking up the Chevalier's Servant in her House went to the Castle of  Beauplan  and easily acquitted herself of her Commission no Person in the House having the least Suspicion of the Cause of her coming  Marianne  took an Opportunity to give the Letter to the Countess when she retired in the Evening to her Closet Madam  de Berci  was at first surprized and angry at the Boldness of her Woman she reproved her severely and for a long Time refused to receive the Letter from her Hands But this Girl who had some Power over the Mind of her Mistress and who wanted neither Wit nor Cunning used so many Arguments to prove that she might without Reproach receive a Letter from a Man to whom she owed such extraordinary Obligations that the Countess overcame at length by her Reasons and secretly persuaded by the Motions of her own Heart took the Chevalier's Letter from her and opening it with extreme Agitation read these Words  How shall a Lover Madam whom you have condemned to Silence whom you have banished from your Sight make known the Violence of his Passion Yet to be allowed to make you sensible that he loves you is the only Consolation he requires Is it too  much Presumption to wish to be pitied by you when Pity is all he dares hope for or request But how can you pity unless you are a Witness of the Torments I endure And how can you be a Witness of them while I remain banished from your Sight Consider Madam I beseech you that this Exile which I have suffered is your own Work At length relent and permit me to approach you again afford me the Blessing of beholding you 'tis all I ask and it is the only Means of preserving a Life which I would lose with Pleasure to do you Service Your Answer will determine my Fate  The Countess of  Berci  was greatly affected with this Letter some Sighs escaped her unknown to herself the Chevalier's respectful Passion lulled all her Suspicions asleep and the unhappy State of his Mind excited her Pity Nevertheless she was in Doubt whether she ought to write him an Answer Reason and Honour dictated to her that a virtuous Woman ought not to indulge herself in a Correspondence however innocent with a Man who is her profest Lover But Gratitude and Compassion pleaded the Chevalier's Cause with such inresistable Force that she flattered herself she might write to him and even see him without wounding the Duty she owed her Husband The Count of  Berci  designed the next Day to accompany his Father and Brother to  Fontainebleau  she therefore resolved  not only to write an Answer to the Chevalier but also to take Advantage of her Husband's Absence to give him an Interview in private and taking up the Pen she wrote to him in these Words  I answer your Letter Monsieur contrary to the Rules my Duty imposes upon me to put you in Mind of yours which is to cease a Pursuit that will infallibly be fruitless and may be fatal Hope for nothing from me beyond Esteem and Gratitude the one I cannot refuse your Merit and I owe the other to the Services you have lately rendered me in the Persons of my Father and Brother I am willing to believe that you love me with Honour and this Thought alone prevails with me to grant you Permission to see me I shall be alone on Friday in the Afternoon if this Letter reaches you soon enough you may come to  Beauplan  and at eleven o'Clock at Night you will find the Garden Door open and  Marianne  attending to conduct you to me See Monsieur what Hazards I run to express my Acknowledgement for the Obligations you have conferred upon me But again I warn you not to expect that you can ever inspire me with any other Sentiments than what the most rigid Virtue will permit a reasonable Woman to entertain  The Countess who was too innocent and unexperienced to reflect on the Consequences  of such a suspicious Interview was very well satisfied with the Terms in which she had conceived her Letter But this false Step however guiltless she was in Intention was soon followed by the most dreadful Alarms it exposed her to the greatest Danger she had ever been in during her whole Life and was the Source of all those Misfortunes she afterwards proved The CountryWoman returned the next Morning to the Castle and received the Answer which the Countess had written from the Hands of  Marianne  that Girl pretended it was a Letter from her to the Chevalier  des Essars  The Chevalier's Servant set out for  Paris  as soon as it was dark and mindful of his Master's Orders made such haste that he arrived there early the next Day Although there was nothing in the Countess's Letter which could flatter the Chevalier with a Hope of being more happy than Compassion restrained by Duty could make him yet it filled him with inconceivable Transport and he mounted on Horseback that Instant in order to be at  Beauplan  at the appointed Time  The Count of  Berci  took Horse to attend his Father and Brotherinlaw to  Fontainebleau  that very Day on which the Chevalier arrived at  Beauplan  As he went only in complaisance to the Marquis and his Son they would not suffer him to go farther than half way and then obliged him to return back The Countess who had not expected to see her  Husband that Night was greatly perplexed at his Return she now repented of the Assignation she had made the Chevalier  des Essars  and was in dreadful Uneasiness lest it should be discovered Yet she concealed her Agitations from her Husband as well as she possibly could but she was too much disordered to be able to eat any Supper The Count was uneasy supposing she was indisposed Madam  de Berci  eagerly catched at that Expedient and made it her Excuse for retiring immediately after Supper to her Chamber The Count attributing his Wife's Indisposition to her Grief at parting with her Father and Brother obligingly endeavoured to console her and conducting her to her Apartment withdrew to his own  The Night was dark and cloudy and savoured the Desires of the Chevalier  des Essars  who was very solicitious to prevent being seen near the Castle of  Beauplan  lest it should reflect any Dishonour upon the Character of his Mistress The whole Family was already enjoying the Sweets of a profound Repose when  Marianne  going softly out of her Lady's Apartment went to the Gate she there found the passionate Chevalier who loverlike had through Impatience come an Hour sooner than he was directed and had waited for her with great Anxiety  Marianne  did not fail to exaggerate the Danger to which she exposed herself to do him Service and protested her Zeal for his Interest so strongly that the Chevalier  who thought the Moments too precious to waste in Thanks took a fine Ring off his Finger and gave it to the faithful Confidant in acknowledgement of her Kindness she then desired him to follow her with the utmost Precaution and brought him without being discovered into the Apartment of the Countess Madam  de Berci  looked so charming in the elegant Undress she was in that the Chevalier lost in Admiration and Desire almost forgot the Condition upon which he was permitted to see her But the lovely Countess who was capable of inspiring at once Respect and Love represt this first Transport by a modest Regard full of mingled Sweetness and Severity then desiring the Chevalier to be seated she spoke thus to him  If you knew Monsieur the Danger to which I expose my Reputation and perhaps my Life by seeing you here these slight Charms would take up less of your Attention My Lord is not at  Fontainebleau  with my Father as I expected he would have been this Night he is retired to his own Chamber in complaisance to me his unexpected Return to  Beauplan  perplexed me greatly and in order to keep my Word with you I have been obliged to feign myself indisposed do not then Monsieur abuse a Favour which I could not refuse to your earnest Intreaties and to the Interest I take in the Preservation of your Life which you have so lately ventured in  the Service of my Family In your Favour I have in some Degree transgressed the Laws of Decorum the Consideration I have had for you ought to secure your Gratitude and to prevent your Forming any Hopes from a Condescension I cannot help condemning in myself know this is the last Time you must ever expect to see me alone  The Countess had scarce uttered these last Words when some body knocked hastily at the Door of the Antichamber the Chevalier did not doubt but it was the Count and began to suspect that Madam  de Berci  had laid this Snare to ruin him when he was first told that a Man whom he had supposed to be at  Fontainebleau  was in his own Chamber in that very House he entertained some Suspicions against the Countess but had already rejected them as too injurious to that amiable Lady when the Noise at the Door of her Antichamber awaked them again in his Mind and now not doubting any longer that he was betrayed  Madam said he to the Countess you had many other Ways of freeing yourself from a Passion which you doubtless thought too importunate without sacrifising me to your Husband's Revenge But be assured Madam I will not lose my Life without putting that of your Lord's into Danger into whose Hands you have delivered me  Ah how you injure me by these Suspicions replied the Countess half dead with fear it is not now a Time to endeavour by Oaths to assure you of my Sincerity but the Testimony you will soon have of it will make you know the Injustice you do me but retire I conjure you behind the Tapistry you will be absolutely safe from a Discovery there and if you are not convinced of my Innocence sacrifice my Life to your Revenge  She spoke these Words with a low Voice and then called  Marianne  who had heard the Knocking at the Door but like one that understood her Business well made no Offers to stir till she had Directions from her Lady The Chevalier a little reassured by his Mistress Words placed himself behind the Tapistry holding it close with his left Hand but through a little Opening which he left that he might see who came into the Room he held a PocketPistol which he resolved in Case of Necessity to use in his own Defence  Marianne  as if hardly awake came into her Lady's Room with a loose Gown on and went to open the Door of the Antichamber to her Lord for it was he that demanded Entrance The Count as he approached his Wife passed so near the Place where the Chevalier was concealed that he touched the End of the Pistol the Chevalier acknowledged afterwards that he was never so much alarmed in his Life but the Count  went on without observing any Thing and seeing that his Wife was not yet in Bed he sat down upon the Sopha which the Chevalier had quitted but a few Moments before and with a Look of tender Anxiety which relieved the Countess from some Part of her Fears enquired how she did  Madam  de Berci  answered in a low Voice that she had been worse since Supper that she was feverish and just going to Bed to try if she could get a little Rest which she hoped would relieve her The Count taking her Hand felt her Pulse which from the Terrors with which she was agitated beating a little unequally  You are indeed disordered said the tender Count but I hope your Illness will not be dangerous I could not be easy till I saw you I have been but a few Moments in Bed yet was terrified by a horrid Dream from which I awaked in Agonies I dreamt a monstrous Dragon was going to devour you your Indisposition which I had imagined was but slight rose to my thoughts I began to be apprehensive that this was the Dragon and that you were grown much worse since I saw you I came eagerly to know the State of your Health and thank Heaven I find it better than I expected but why are you not in bed Let me have the Satisfaction to see you enjoying a quiet Sleep before I return to my own Apartment  The Chevalier's Suspicions returned when he heard the Count relate his Dream he was absolutely persuaded that he was discovered and the Countess dreadfully alarmed knew not what to expect The Count's Interpretation of his Dream reassured them a little but when they found he intended to stay some Time longer and that he pressed Madam  de Berci  to go to Bed all again seemed lost The Chevalier was apprehensive that he should not be able to continue long in the Situation he was in for it was extreamly uneasy Nevertheless as he had a great deal of Courage and was very much in love the Hope of the Count's retiring in an Hour supported him under so disagreeable a Restraint but he indulged his ill Humour with secretly execrating this too tender Husband who after three Years Marriage came so unseasonably to give his Wife a Proof of his Fondness  The Countess of  Berci  was obliged to go to Bed and under pretence that the Taper which the Count had brought in with him glared too full in her Eyes she ordered  Marianne  to draw the Curtain on that Side where the Chevalier stood concealed  Marianne  obeying her Lady's Orders with too much Precipitation disingaged herself from a little Dog which had followed the Count into his Wife's Apartment the Animal being free ran to the Place where the trembling Lover was concealed and discovering instinctively  that a Stranger was in the Room he began to bark so loud that the Count was rising from his Seat to endeavour to pacify him himself But the Countess in great agitation held back her Husband And  Marianne  coaxing the little Creature into good Humour at last catched him in her Arms and carried him into her own Chamber where she did not fail to beat him severely for his unseasonable Fidelity to his Master  The Countess of  Ber  i  finding her Husband resolved to stay still she was quite composed was obliged to counterfeit herself asleep and the Count when he was assured she was so rising softly went out of her Apartment and retired to his own His Absence relieved the Countess and the Chevalier from terrible Inquietude the ardent Lover as soon as he was withdrawn left the Place of his Concealment and went to the Countess's Bedside where he threw himself on his Knees and implored her pardon for the ungenerous Suspicion he had entertained The Countess sweetly blushing at the Situation she was in before her Lover told him she had already pardoned him and hoped that for the future he would judge more candidly of her Sincerity and Honour The Chevalier scarce listened to what she said he had not only forgot his past Danger but also the Conditions to which he had bound himself when he requested an interview with the Countess  Insolent Man cried the Countess darting a disdainful Look at him and pushing him away with all her Force is it thus that you abuse the Credulity of an unhappy Woman who has so lately exposed both her Honour and her Life for you Base and ungrateful as you are was it to cover your impious Designs that these Appearances of Respect and Submission were assumed But go avoid my Sight and thank my Clemency that I content myself with Depriving you for ever of my Esteem without making you feel the just Effects of my Indignation  Ah Madam replied the impetuous Chevalier how can you imagine I should be Master of myself exposed to the Assault of so many Charms My Passion is stronger than my Reason its Violence is my Excuse and I ought less to excite your Anger for my Presumption than your Compassion for the Miseries I have suffered  These Words were not calculated to remove the Countess's Anger any more than the Behaviour by which they were followed That unfortunate Lady now first perceiving the Danger to which she had exposed her Virtue assumed more Courage and Resolution she called  Marianne  with loud Cries the Terror she was in not giving her Time to reflect that her Husband might be alarmed her Woman appearing the Chevalier full of Repentance for his Attempt retired from the Bedside the Countess no longer  observing any Terms with him commanded him with a Look and Voice which made him tremble to leave her Chamber and fiercely threatened to send for her Lord and shew him the real Dragon which he had seen only in his Dream unless he obeyed her that Instant  It was in vain that the unhappy Chevalier endeavoured by Tears and Prayers to soften the Anger of his incensed Mistress she was inexorable and he was obliged to quit her with the Grief of knowing that he had lost her Esteem by giving way to the Impetuosity of his Desires Fatal Love blind and ungovernable Passion thy highest Favours are too deerly purchased by the Dangers the Inquietude and the Remorse thou causest  The unfortunate Chevalier full of Shame and Grief was a hundred Times ready to run his Sword through his Heart before the Eyes of Madam  de Berci  Adieu Madam said he to her my unfeigned Repentance and the miserable Life I am going to drag on at a Distance from you will I hope one Day procure me Pardon for an Attempt as fruitless as it was involuntary  The Countess did not deign to say a single Word to him in Answer and the Chevalier not daring to importune her any farther made her a low Bow and followed  Marianne  who  conducted him to the Door of the Antichamber without any Light for fear of being perceived The Chevalier was in such agitation of Mind that he hardly knew what he was doing and as he descended the Stairs his Foot slipping he tumbled down and the Pistol which he held in his Hand for Fear of some Accident went off and alarmed the whole House  The Count his Brother and several of the Men Servants got up immediately and made the Castle resound with their Cries of Thieves Assassins The Countess at the Report of the Pistol was almost distracted with her Apprehensions she heard her Lord's Voice and knew not whether the Chevalier had fi  ed at him or the Count at the Chevalier  Marianne  who had quitted the Chevalier at the Door of the Antichamber and who knew not any more than her Lady the true Cause of what had happened trembled at the Punishment which she expected and bemoaned herself piteously the whole Castle was full of Tumult and Disorder  In the mean Time the Chevalier who found himself at the Bottom of the Staircase by his Fall missing his Hat and his Pistol resolved not to leave them behind him tho' by staying to look for them he run the Danger of being seized but he was sensible if those Things were found it would be known that it was he who had been there and that was  equal to a Discovery of his Person The Moon gave Light enough through the Windows to direct his Search and he was so fortunate as to find both his Hat and Pistol and to reach the Garden Gate without being discovered some of the Count's Servants ran thither a few Moments after and finding the Gate open they supposed the Thieves had escaped that way they had a Glimpse of the Chevalier as he ran but it was not light enough for them to distinguish his Person however supposing him to be one of the Rogues they pursued him but the Chevalier made such Speed that he joined his Servant who was waiting for him before the Fellows could come up with him and mounting his Horse which his Man held ready he gallopped across the Country without keeping any direct Road and at last got to a Village where he concealed himself for a few Hours and then returned to  Paris  The END of the First PART  THE HISTORY OF THE Chevalier DES ESSARS AND THE Countess OF BERCI PART II  THE Count of  Berci  and his Brother who had been among the first that were alarmed by the Report of the Pistol having as has been already said risen in haste they armed themselves with their Swords and Pistols and followed by some of the Servants who carried Flambeaux in their Hands they went to the Apartment of the Countess whose Terror at seeing her Lord and his Brother enter with such a formidable Equipage was so great that she fainted away The  The Count full of Grief at this Accident ran eagerly to her Remedies were applied but her Husband's tender Solicitude and the affectionate Things he said to her had more Efficacy in recovering her Spirits than all the other Endeavours which were used for that purpose  It was her Fear that the Chevalier had been discovered which reduced her to that Condition but her Lord's excessive Concern for it convinced her that the Chevalier had had the good Fortune to escape without being known This Thought restored her Spirits and the Count entirely dissipated all her Suspicions by telling her that the Tumult and Noise there had been in the House was occasioned by some Rogues who had attempted to rob it  I beg Madam said he embracing her tenderly that you will not suffer yourself to be alarmed thus to the Prejudice of your Health my Brother and myself will go and search every Part of the Castle that we may be assured none of these Villains are concealed in it Banish your Fears then and depend upon it added he smiling that if we find some of these Rogues lurking here still we will give you a good Account of them  He then ordered the Countess's Woman to be called to stay in the Chamber and leaving two of the Footmen to guard the Door of her Apartment he went with his Brother and the others to search the Castle  The Count after traversing over the whole House went down into the Court Yard where he met two of his Servants who had just returned from pursuing the Chevalier They had run after him a long Time in the Fields but the Chevalier being well mounted as were his Servants likewise he was soon out of Sight and the Count's Footmen thinking it was needless to follow them  ny farther at such a Disadvantage came home no wiser than they went  As soon as they saw the Count they related to him what they had done and as in their terrified Imaginations the Chevalier and his Servant appeared to be five or six Men so they did not fail to double the Number and confidently affirm that there were no less than a dozen Rogues whom their Presence unarmed as they were put to Flight Another who had a mind to have it said that he also had a Share in this terrible Adventure declared with great firmness of Countenance that it was at him the Rogue who had got Entrance into the House fired the Pistol and that he heard the Whizzing of the Ball as it happily past by his Ear without hurting him  The Count of  Berci  fully persuaded that the Castle had been beset by Robbers went up to his Wife's Apartment  I told you Madam said he as he entred that there was nothing to apprehend my Servants have just now informed me that the  Thieves alarmed at the Noise we made and by the Lights supposing the whole Family was up are fled with the utmost Precipitation one of them had it seems got over the Garden Walls in order to open the Gate to the others but as soon as it is Day I shall take Care to prevent such Attempts for the future by making it impossible for any one to climb over those Walls again Think no more then I conjure you Madam of what is past all now is safe try to calm your Mind and get an Hour or two's Repose I am extremely apprehensive that the Alarms you have suffered this Night will disorder you greatly  The Countess full of inward Remorse which her Lord's excessive Tenderness redoubled begged him to retire to his own Chamber and she would try to compose herself She could scarce retrain her Tears as she spoke her Voice faltered the Count saw her greatly disordered but far from guessing the Cause he concluded all was owing to the Terrors she had been in on Account of the Attempt he supposed had been made on the Castle he desired her Women to watch by their Lady and then taking Leave of her with a tender Embrace and an ardent Ejaculation for her Health he returned to his own Apartment  The Countess as soon as her Lord was withdrawn commanded her Women to quit  her Chamber she longed to be alone to give free Vent to her Tears A Woman who has just Notions of Honour needs no other Tormentors when she has transgressed the strict Laws of it than the Stings of her own Conscience Madam  de Berci  had through Ignorance of the World and by her too great Sensibility of the Services the Chevalier had done her Family been betrayed to make a false Step which she too late acknowledged to be so Her Eyes were opened by the Chevalier's Behaviour she was enabled to judge of the Irregularity of her Conduct by the Advantage her unworthy Lover had endeavoured to take of it She trembled at the Remembrance of the Danger to which she had exposed her Virtue she accused herself she exclaimed against the Baseness of the Chevalier  Unhappy Wretch cried she bursting into Tears what hast thou done and what would have been thy Fate if Heaven respecting the Innocence of thy Intentions had not had Compassion upon thee Justly detested by a Husband who now adores thee thy least Punishment if he had spared thy Life would have been to be confounded with Women of infamous Reputation upon whose Forehead is engraved in Characters never to be effaced the shameful Story of their Crimes And oh fatal Aggravation of my Folly such a Husbandblush blush ungrateful Wretch at the Remembrance of his Tenderness What Return hast thou  made for this unexampled Affection Thou hast not scrupled to endanger the Quiet of his whole Life by submitting to a private Interview with a Man whose wild Passion thou wast but too well acquainted with thou hast introduced into his House at the dead of Night the premeditated Assassin of his Honour Thou mayst judge unhappy Woman by the Grief with which thou sawest him overwhelmed for thy feigned Sickness what would have been his Agonies if thy fatal Secret had been discovered Oh mayst thou be ever ignorant of it my dear and injured Lord and may my Repentance and my Tears blot out of my Heart the Image of that most insolent and most base of Men  With such Complaints and in such bitter Reflexions did the unhappy Countess waste the remaining Part of the Night Quiet was banished from her Mind and Sleep from her Eyes the Morning found her bathed in Tears and seized with the first Symptoms of a Fever which in a few Days increased to such a Degree that her Life was despaired of Her Lord almost distracted at the Danger she was in never quitted her a Moment during eight Days that the Physicians thought her Recovery doubtful Her Youth at length and her good Constitution overcame the Violence of her Disease she began to recover tho' by slow Degrees and in this State we shall leave  her and see what passed at  Fontainebleau  where we left the old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  As soon as he arrived he went immediately to pay his Respects to his Majesty his gracious Master under whom he had made his last Campaigns His Design was to solicit a Pardon for his Son as likewise for the Chevalier  des Essars  to whom he was so greatly obliged That great Monarch who never forgot the Services of his faithful Subjects gave the Marquis a most gracious Reception and with that Affability which was so natural to him welcomed him to Court and enquired into the Motive which had induced him to quit his Retreat  Sire replied the old Man the Desire of seeing once more the greatest and best of Kings and of embracing my Children has brought me again and probably for the last Time to Court I find myself hasting forward to my Decay and all that for the future I shall be able to do will be to pray for your Majesty's Glory and Happiness but I would beg Leave to present a young Man to you in my Stead who eagerly pants to follow you in your glorious Expeditions and wishes for Life only to efface by his Courage and Loyalty shewn in your Service the Shame and Disgrace he has incurred by disobeying your wise Laws It is for my Son most gracious Sovereign  that I plead and most humbly implore that your Majesty will pardon him a Fault he has committed lately and impute it to the wild Sallies of inconsiderate Youth and not to stubborn Will and premeditated Disobedience  Monsieur  de SaintSauveur  said that generous Prince if your Son has failed in the Respect and Obedience he owes me by his last Combat I have not forgot those in which you have formerly shed your Blood for my Service I therefore not only grant you his Pardon which I cannot refuse to your Services but also that of the Chevalier  des Essars  which probably you was afraid to ask for I have been informed of your Adventure in the Forest of  Fontainebleau  the Assistance he so generously gave you and his Valour in saving your Life engages me to grant this and to pardon him out of Consideration to you  Sire replied the old Man in a Rapture throwing himself at the King's Feet I have not Words to express my grateful Sense of your Majesty's Goodness in thus granting me the Life of my Son your Majesty who like a God has read those Wishes in my Heart which I did not dare to give Utterance to best knows how much I am affected with your unmerited Indulgence Yes my gracious Lord you have prevented my most ardent Desires and by granting  me the Life of the Chevalier  des Essars  you have given me an Opportunity of returning in some Degree the Obligations I have to that valiant Man to whose Generosity I owe the Happiness I now enjoy of embraceing the Knees of my indulgent Master  The old Marquis then stepping to his Son who was standing behind a Crowd of Courtiers  Approach my Son said he and bless the Clemency of your Prince who has been pleased at my Intercession to pardon you and resolve to prove to him one Day that the Life you have received from me and which his Goodness has preserved belongs wholly to him and remember that you never more must hazard it but in his Service  The young Marquis approaching with a graceful Modesty threw himself at the King's Feet who raised him up instantly and assured his Father that he would take the Care of his Son's Fortune entirely upon himself  In this Manner it was that the great  Henry  tempered Majesty with Sweetness and accompanied those Pardons he granted to his offending Subjects with the most striking Instances of Generosity and Goodness Great and magnanimous Prince thy Memory will live forever in the Hearts of all true  Frenchmen  and thy gentle Virtues be as much their  Love and Veneration as thy immortal Fame their Glory  The Marquis  de SaintSauveur  as soon as he had quitted the King retired to his Apartment eager to enjoy the delicate Pleasure of acquainting the Chevalier  des Essars  with what his Prince had just done for him He told him in his Letter that the Pardon he had solicited was granted less to his weak Intercession than to his own Merit and the Fame of his great Actions and particularly to the Valour and Generosity he had shewn in exposing his own Life in the Forest of  Fontainebleau  to save his He added that his modest Endeavours to conceal from him the Name of his Benefactor had all been fruitless and that he had at length had the good Fortune to know a Man from whom his Family were every Day receiving new Benefits that the last Favour he had received from him in preserving the Life of his Son so greatly endeared the former to him that he despaired of ever finding Opportunities sufficient to make known the Extent of his Gratitude  The good old Man after having thus given Vent to the Overflowings of his grateful Heart employed the few remaining Hours he staid st  Fontainebleau  in giving some Lessons of Wisdom and Prudence to his Son recommending to him in the most earnest Manner  to persevere in his Loyalty to his Sovereign and never more to offend him by disobeying his Commands  He then set out for his Estate in  Burgundy  where he arrived without meeting with any ill Accident The Marchioness  de SaintSauveur  his Wife had heard some Reports concerning his Adventure in the Forest as likewise of her Son's Duel with Monsieur  de Morigny  She had suffered great Uneasiness but the Recital her Lord made her of the happy Event of all turned her Fears and Sorrows into transports of Joy She admired the Valour of the Chevalier  des Essars  whose Person she was not acquainted with but whose Name and Quality she knew and was extremely impatient to see and thank a Man to whom she was obliged for the Lives of her Husband and her Son  But of what Use was it to this brave Man that his Merit was acknowledged by his Prince and applauded by the public Voice since all was not able to comfort him for the Loss of his Mistress's Esteem We have already related how he fortunately escaped being known by the Servants of the Count of  Berci  After having wandered several Days about the Country he at last took the Road to  Paris  and arrived there full of the deepest Despair As he durst not venture abroad on Account of his last Combat he confined himself to his House all Day and went out sometimes  at Night to visit Monsieur  de Morigny  It was not in his Power to conceal his Sadness from him but all the Endeavours of this tender Friend to prevail upon him to disclose the Cause were ineffectual the Chevalier had too much Delicacy to make him the Confident of his Passion for the Countess of  Berci  and he rather chose to shut up all his Sorrow in his Heart and want the Consolation of a faithful and sympathising Friend than fail in his Respect for her who was now dearer to him than ever  He was in this cruel Situation when he received the Letter from the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  it gave him at first a transient Relief and he tasted some Pleasure in the Assurances it brought him of the Friendship and Esteem of a Man who was become so dear to him But a Letter which a few Days after he received from the Count of  Berci  gave him far more Satisfaction That tender Friend wrote that he had too long deprived him of the Pleasure of embracing a Man to whom the Countess and himself had such great Obligations that he could not bear his Absence and conjured him to set out immediately for the Castle of  Beauplan  where he soon expected the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and he likewise earnestly intreated him to bring Monsieur  de Morigny  with him who he said must be their Friend since he was his  The Chevalier firmly persuaded that he had lost for ever the Esteem of his Mistress did not figure to himself any Happiness at  Beauplan  farther than that he should enjoy the Sight of that inhuman Beauty He could not flatter himself that he should be able to obtain her Pardon for the Offence he had committed but he hoped that his Repentance and his Grief would excite her Pity He therefore resolved to gratify the Count of  Berci  's obliging Impatience to see him by an immediate Departure from  Paris  he shewed the Count's Letter to Monsieur  de Morigny  who wearied with the Length of his Confinement accepted with Joy Monsieur  de Berci  's obliging Invitation  Beauplan  being likewise but half a Day's Journey from Court it gave him a better Opportunity of soliciting his Pardon there than he could do at  Paris  As he had several powerful Protectors about the King's Person was not the first Aggressor and as his Majesty had pardoned the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and the Chevalier  des Essars  there was Room to hope he would not be the only one that was punished And accordingly his Friends exerted their Interest for him with such Success that they obtained his Pardon which was sent to him eight Days after his Arrival at  Beauplan  with the Chevalier  des Essars  The Countess of  Berci  was in extreme Perplexity when her Lord sent to inform her that the Chevalier was come the Count had  not mentioned to her his Intention of writing to him at  Paris  he did not doubt but she would be rejoiced to see again a Man who had preserved her Father and Brother He took Pleasure in giving her what he thought an agreable Surprize He surprized her indeed more than he imagined but she was far from being pleased The Chevalier entered her Apartment before she had Time to answer her Lord he advanced with a respectful Awe to salute her A Blush caused at once by Indignation and Shame overspread her Face and gave her new Charms but the Mortification she felt at being obliged to conceal her just Rage from the Chevalier gave her great Pain However the Force she put upon herself to behave with Complaisance was not perceived and she acted her Part so artfully that the Chevalier began to conceive Hopes she might in Time be prevailed upon to forgive him  he answered the Compliments he made her with Freedom and Politeness she praised his Valour and Generosity she returned him Thanks for the Services her Father and Brother had received from him but she resolved in her own Heart to make him pay dear for the Constraint she had been obliged to lay upon herself  The young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and Monsieur  de Morigny  continued a long Time embraced and fully persuaded of each other's Merit and reciprocal Tenderness they drew more strait than ever the Knot of their ancient  Friendship which nothing after was able to loose Monsieur  de Morigny  was received with great Kindness by the Count of  Berci  and his Brother as likewise by the charming Countess whom he greatly admired  After the first Compliments were over the Count of  Berci  related to the Chevalier  des Essars  the Story of the Robbers painting with great Vivacity the Alarms which the whole Family had been in and gave a long Account of an Affair that the Chevalier knew better than himself The Chevalier had occasion for all his Prudence and Art to conceal from the Company the Embarrassment this Recital threw him into the Countess who was less able to repress or conceal her Emotions shewed a Concern while the Count was speaking sufficient to have betrayed her if it had not been ascribed by him to the Remembrance of the Terror she had suffered  The Chevalier who knew the Danger she had been in and saw by her Looks that her Health had suffered greatly was sensibly afflicted at the Inconveniences he had brought upon her he reproached himself a thousand Times with his Rashness and Presumption he cursed the fatal Effects of his impetuous Passion and endeavoured to give her some Idea of his Grief and Repentance by his Looks since he could not speak to her he was resolved to try the first Opportunity that offered and let her know how much he had suffered from his own  Remorse for having offended her but be sought in vain for such an Opportunity Far from giving him one she avoided his Looks as much as possible and if by Chance her Eyes incountered his she would hastily withdraw them again as if she had seen a Basilisk  The Chevalier again applied for Assistance to  Marianne  he intreated this Woman to endeavour to make his Peace for him he gave her several Letters for the Countess but she would not receive them and severely reproving her Woman for accepting of such Commissions forbad her ever to do the like again upon Pain of being dismissed from her Service and  Marianne  tho' it would have been her Interest to have effected this Reconciliation was so terrified at this Threat that she would not afterwards concern herself in the Chevalier's Affairs  The unfortunate Chevalier had been already fifteen Days at  Beauplan  and had used every Artifice that Love and Wit could suggest to procure an Interview with the Countess but in vain when one Day observing the Count to be employed in his Gardens giving Directions to his Workmen for some new Embellishment the Plan of which he had drawn himself he quitted some Company that were walking with him and ran to Madam  de Berci's  Apartment resolving to attempt every thing to gain her Pardon But she being always upon her Guard against such  Surprizes rose up as soon as she saw her Chamber Door open and perceiving the Chevalier she flew into her Closet and fastened the Door Her Lover in Despair at this new Instance of her Rigour said all that a Heart torn with Remorse could dictate to move her but his Complaints his Protestations and his Grief were fruitless she carried her Severity so far that she would not deign even to answer him and he was obliged to withdraw for fear of irritating her still more  Her obstinate Resentment could not break his Chains he had merited it all and his own Heart acknowledged that he did so incapable of vanquishing his Passion for the Countess and despairing of ever being able to gain her Pardon he resolved to retire from a House where he was every day exposed to new Torments and seek a glorious Death in the Field  Holland  was then the Theatre of War as it was likewise the School for the bravest Men that ever distinguished themselves in Arms The ArchDuke threatned to attack  Rhimberg  and the States were preparing to defend it The Commanders on one side were the Marquis  de Spinola  General of the Archduke's Army and the valiant Count  de Buguoy  the first of whom had already acquired immortal Glory before  Ostend  with the  Spaniards  and  Walloons  On the other was Prince  Maurice  of  Orange  whose Name alone is an Eulogium  he had with him a younger Brother who emulous of his Glory tread already in his Steps he was indeed at the head of an Army less numerous than  Spinola's  but it was chiefly composed of the two most gallant Nations in the World I mean the  French  and the  English  in the Troops of the former were many of the Nobility commanded by the great  Bethune  and the brave  Chatillon  who were preparing to join the Forces of Prince  Maurice  Although the Chevalier  des Essars  had been treated less cruelly than he was by his Mistress yet he loved Glory too much to remain an idle Spectator in  France  of the Laurels his Countrymen were gaining he mentioned his Design of making a Campaign in  Holland  to the Count of  Berci  who not only approved of it but assured him he would go thither likewise and both of them declaring their Resolution next Morning to Monsieur  de Morigny  and the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  they would not be left behind  The Count intreated his Brother to stay with Madam  de Berci  during his Absence but this young Man full of a noble Ardour that could not be repressed was sensible how shameful it would appear to stay in the Castle of  Beauplan  and be the Guardian of his Sisterinlaw while his eldest Brother was exposing his Life to the uncertain Chance of War he resolved therefore to partake his Labours and his Dangers and all being concluded  on they gave Orders for their several Equipages to be prepared with the utmost Expedition  The Countess was greatly afflicted when she heard her Lord's Design and that it was the Chevalier  des Essars  who had persuaded him to it It was not difficult for her to discover that it was her rigorous Treatment of this unfortunate Lover which had induced him to take such a Resolution She now began to repent of the extreme Rigour she had shewn which was going to deprive her of a Husband so dear to her attributing all her Uneasiness to the Thoughts of being separated from him but it was in vain that she endeavoured to conceal her Sentiments from herself She could not without great Concern reflect on the Dangers to which her Lover was going to expose himself and although he had offended her yet she was apprehensive of the Effects of his Despair and that Death which he was going to seek would doubtless deprive her of a Lover for whom in spite of all her Virtue and her Pride she felt in her Heart something more tender than Esteem But this was a Confession she durst not make to herself and studiously avoiding any Examination of her own Thoughts she endeavoured to persuade herself that all her Fears were upon her Lord's Account he whom it was her Duty to love and by whom she was loved with so much Tenderness She resolved therefore to prevail upon the Chevalier to lay aside their Design  she thought she could not have a better Motive for breaking through her Resolution never to have any private Discourse with him and did not in the least Doubt that by the Power she had over him she could make him abandon a Design which he had formed in Despair and she persuaded herself that if she succeeded on this side the Count her Husband would no longer think of leaving her  Full of this Project the Success of which she was sure of in her own Imagination she fought for an Opportunity to speak to the Chevalier which however was not the least difficult Part of her Undertaking for he who despaired of ever gaining her Pardon and fearful of offending her farther took Care never to throw himself in her Way as usual so that the Countess finding herself disapointed in her Endeavours to meet him alone was beginning to doubt whether she should ever succeed without making it her Request to speak to him a Humiliation she would fain have avoided when Chance brought her one Day into a Room fronting the Garden where she saw the Chevalier alone standing at a Window in an Attitude that shewed he was wholly absorbed in Thought  The Countess excessively pleased at this accidental Meeting approached the Window where he stood with an Intention to speak to him that very Moment when the Chevalier supposing she had no other Design than  to amuse herself with looking out of it left it free to her with a respectful Bow and went to the other End of the Room where he stood looking at the Count of  Berci  and the Marquis  de Saint Sauveur  and Monsieur  de Morigny  who were playing at Tennis  It would not be easy to determine whether this Behaviour gave the Countess more Shame or Vexation but it is certain that she was extremely disappointed She understood this Instance of Respect in the Chevalier to be a plain Avowal of Contempt  How insolent he is said she to herself but I will not give him Room to imagine that I am weak enough to run after him no I will rather suffer the Loss of all that is dear to me in the World  She now leaned upon the Window pensive in her Turn full of Reflections very mortifying to her Pride and fain would she have forced herself to believe that her Pride only was concerned she felt Emotions more painful than those which arise from Confusion and Anger and the supposed Neglect of the Chevalier advanced his Affairs with the Countess more than all the Proofs he had hitherto given her of his Passion  But he in the mean Time observing the Countess to be in a deep Revery knew not what to think of her Behaviour He soon began to repent he had left the Window and after he had continued looking at the Players a few Moments though his Attention  was wholly employed another Way he stept forwards with a Design to return to the Place he had quitted so unseasonably but the Countess who was extremely piqued by what he had done seeing him approach left the Window in her Turn and went hastily out of the Room darting a Look at him as she past that upon any other Occasion would have given him inexpressible Pain but as he now interpreted it filled him with a Joy he had never experienced before  He comprehended in an Instant all that had passed in the Heart of his Mistress He was in Raptures at this new Mark of her Rigour and thoroughly acquainted as he was with all the Motions of a Heart in Love he saw with inconceivable Transport that the Disdain and Rage which the Countess had darted from her Eyes were the Effects of affronted Tenderness and neglected Advances He blessed his good Fortune and flattered himself with the sweet Idea of being more loved than he had believed he resigned himself up entirely to the intoxicating Charms of Hope But this Alteration in his Affairs with the Countess far from inducing him to lay aside his former Design confirmed him in his Resolution of pursuing it the War in  Holland  he did not doubt would afford him Opportunities of shewing himself worthy of her Esteem and this Thought alone was sufficient had he been less brave than he was to make him eagerly embrace them  The Count and his Guests having given over Play went to Madam de  Berci's  Apartment Her Vexation which was visible enough in her Eyes made her Lord conclude that she was afflicting herself for his approaching Departure which the had often endeavoured to prevent He therefore applied himself to make her approve of it as a Thing absolutely necessary He represented to her the Disgrace he should incur if he neglected so favourable an Opportunity of acquiring Honour and advancing his Fortune assuring her that although his Love for her would not permit him to wear out his Days in a shameful Indolence yet it should hasten his Return be urged to her so many strong Reasons and so well calculated to make an Impression upon the Mind of a Woman born with just Notions of Honour that she could not help yielding to them whatever Grief it might cost her It was then agreed upon by them both that she should go into the Province of  Burgundy  and stay with her Father and Mother during his Absence they earnestly pressing for such a Visit and that in two Days he should take Leave of her to go to  Paris  and finish the Preparations for his Journey  The Countess though greatly displeased with the Chevalier for his last Behaviour was somewhat softened after her Discourse with her Lord She thought no longer of his supposed Neglect she only considered the Dangers he was going to expose himself to And  whenever she met his Eyes which now happened more frequently than before she saw so much Grief and Tenderness painted in them that she conceived it would be inhuman to deny him the Satisfaction of taking a particular Leave of her She therefore no longer avoided him as usual And these two Lovers having now agreed to speak to each other it was not difficult for them to find an Opportunity The Chevalier who watched her Steps seeing her the Evening before they were to set out for  Paris  walking alone in a covered Alley he joined her with a respectful Air and a Timidity which the late Discovery he had made could not repress  I know not Madam said he to her trembling whether you will condescend to hear for a few Moments the most unfortunate of Men but I dare flatter myself that if you knew the Sincerity of my Repentance for having displeased you and all the Torments I have suffered from that Time your Heart insensible as it is would be moved to pity me but if you are severe enough to think my Crime not sufficiently punished by your Rigour and my own Grief Death I hope will soon revenge you fully on a Wretch who has had the Audacity to offend you I shall suffer it without repining I shall meet it with Indifference nay to satisfy you I will do more and seek it eagerly that I may at once deliver you from a Lover you detest and myself from Torments I can  no longer support Happy still if the Sacrifice I shall make you of my Life will at length appease your Rage which I acknowledge to be just and procure me that Compassion I vainly hoped for while I lived  Chevalier replied the Countess looking on him with Eyes in which Anger and Disdain were wholly extinguished let us speak no more of what is past I am willing to forget your Crime and remember only your Repentance and the Services my Father and my Brother have received from you Live then since I am so far from wishing your Death that I earnestly conjure you to be careful of yourself do not expose your Life to inevitable Dangers I recommend my Husband and my Brother to your Care be watchful over their Safety and do not neglect your own Yes continued she in a Voice more tender your Life is dear to me I will not blush to own it I esteem your Person but do not imagine that this Confession can authorize you to entertain any Hopes to the Prejudice of my Honour it is innocent though it is frank and without Disguise do you then take care to regulate your Conduct by it as the Sentiments I have for you are not inconsistent with my Duty and will be always guided by the strict Rules of Virtue let me hope that your Behaviour will be such as shall not give me Cause to retract them  The Countess of  Berci  stopped at these Words expecting her Lover's Reply but the Chevalier was not composed enough to make any for some Moments he doubted whether what he had heard was not an Illusion of his Senses A Man who from extreme Misery passes rapidly to an Excess of good Fortune could not be more transported out of himself than the happy Chevalier in that sweet Moment  'Ah Madam said he with a Look and Voice expressive of the highest Agitation  your unmerited Goodness is almost as fatal to me as your Rigour my Heart so long tormented by Remorse for having offended you and Grief for having lost your Esteem can with Difficulty bear the Transports with which you have filled it by this Assurance of your Pardon and Promise of your returning Favour this overpays me for all the Torments I have suffered Torments that will ever be dear to me since they have produced such happy Effects Yes Madam I will endeavour to preserve my Life since you desire I should do so I will submissively obey your Commands but will live only to love you with the most pure disinterested Affection and to serve you with the most faithful Respect  Well Monsieur returned the charming Countess begin then by giving me convincing Proofs of the Disinterestedness of your  Affection I love my Husband and my Brother with the utmost Tenderness again I tell you that I confide them to your generous Care do not abandon them in the Danger to which their rash Courage may lead them moderate their ardor and hinder them from exposing their Persons unnecessarily bring them back to me again in Safety pursued she letting fall some Tears from her fine Eyes and be assured that my constant Esteem will be the Price of such a Service  The Chevalier was preparing to assure the Countess that he would pay the most exact Obedience to her Commands when young  Berci  her Brotherinlaw appeared in the Walk and interrupted the most pleasing Conversation he had ever known How difficult is it for a Lover who has lately experienced any unlooked for good Fortune to conceal his Joy The Chevalier at that Moment was hardly to be known he was no more the same Man plunged in Grief and wholly absorbed in Melancholy The Satisfaction he felt shone in his Eyes and enlivened his whole Countenance His Conversation freed from that Restraint he had formerly laboured under was now easy and chearful and as they continued their Walk all three together some lively Sallies escaped him which gave the Countess as good an Opinion of his Wit as she had of his Valour and Generosity  It was not difficult for the Count's Brother to guess the Cause of so extraordinary a Change He supposed his Sisterinlaw had relaxed in her Severity to the Chevalier and if he did not form Suspicions injurious to her Virtue he concluded at least that their Farewel had been very tender and that they were well assured of each other's Affection however he prudently dissembled his Thoughts and contented himself with observing them carefully all the rest of the Evening the Lovers perceived it and were more circumspect but their Eyes often met and to an interested Observer could not fail of betraying their secret Sentiments The next Day was appointed for their Journey to  Paris  The Parting between the Count and Countess was extremely moving they both shed Tears and probably the Chevalier had some Part in those of Madam  de Berci  He was not permitted to indulge his Grief with any outward Expressions of it but his Eyes looked a thousand tender Farewels which the Countess could not but understand  They arrived at  Paris  the same Night and stayed there some Days to provide themselves with Armour and all Things that were necessary for their Expedition and after they had furnished themselves with Letters of Exchange for  Holland  they took Post for that Place leaving Orders that their Equipages should follow them by easy Journies They had the good Fortune to arrive eight Days before  Rhineburg  was invested which gave them Time to throw themselves into the Town that they might have Part in the glorious Defence it made during the three Months which the Siege of that important Place continued  It does not enter into my Design to describe here the Particulars of a Siege which may be read at length in the Histories of  Holland  I shall only relate what properly belongs to the Subject I am treating The Besieged made several Sallies with great Advantage in all which our Voluntiers signalised themselves and were very much taken Notice of but the Chevalier  des Essars  gave so many Proofs of his Courage that he was looked upon as a Prodigy of Strength and Valour Notwithstanding the Promises he made to his adored Countess he was far from acting with Caution he rushed into the thickest Dangers and exposed his Person in every Place where most Glory was to be acquired No Man understood the Art of War better than he did he was particularly skillful in the Art of Fortification and his Advice contributed greatly to prolong the Defence of the Place He might be seen upon the Ramparts like one of the Heroes of old overturning all that made any Attempts to scale them and fearlessly receiving upon his Buckler the innumerable Stokes that were aimed at him He was only attentive to the Preservation of his two Friends the Count of  Berci  and the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  whose Lives were more  precious to him than his own he kept them always in his Sight and never failed to bring them off in Safety when their too great Ardour had carried them in spite of his Remonstrances into Places where their Lives were most exposed  The Siege of  Rhineburg  had already lasted two Months by the uncommon Efforts of the Warriors who defended the Place when it was resolved that a new Sally should be made from which they hoped for great Advantages a dreadful Mine being ordered to be sprung at the same Time to favour the Sally Although our noble  Frenchmen  had been greatly fatigued with their past Labours yet they were determined not to miss this Opportunity of gathering new Laurels The Enemies who did not expect this sudden Sally were at first put into Disorder and fled but soon rallying again the Fight was renewed with equal Fury on both Sides The Count of  Berci's  Brother rashly engaging himself too far from his own Party was taken by the Enemies the Chevalier not being near enough to prevent his Misfortune but being informed of it he resolved cost what it would to recover him he overthrew all that opposed his Passage and the Enemy's Troops amazed at a Courage and Strength which appeared to them more than human dreaded him more than half the Garrison He had already slain a great many with his own Hand when he perceived that his dear Count was just thrown  on the Ground by a Grenadier with a Stroke of his Sword which however had only stunned him The Marquis  de SaintSauveur  his Brotherinlaw was near him but had enough to do to defend himself against the Blows that were aimed at him on all Sides The Grenadier was just going to take away the Life of the Count  de Berci  if the Chevalier who never one Moment forgot the Commands of Madam  de Berci  had not flown to his Relief he struck down with one Blow the Grenadier who was going to murder the Count and after he had helped him up they both joined to disengage the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  who was defending himself alone against three fierce Enemies They soon got rid of them and made a horrible Slaughter of several others who met their Fury The Signal for reentering the Town being given they obeyed with Regret still fighting as they retreated and they were the last that entered having brought off the Troops with great Glory and Success The Chevalier was more pleased with his good Fortune in having preserved his dear Friends than with all the Praises that were given him by those who had been Witnesses of his Actions To have had it in his Power to do some Service to his beloved Countess in the Persons of a Husband and Brother so dear to her gave him more Joy than the Laurels he had gained with so many Dangers and with such loud Applause However they were all three greatly afflicted at the Misfortune  that had happened to young  Berci  A Trumpet was sent next Day to the General to desire he might be treated with the Respect due to his Quality His Captivity lasted but a short Time for he was soon after exchanged for a Kinsman of the Marquis  de Spinola's  who had been taken Prisoner by the Besieged  Rhineburg  had now heldout three Months more through the Valour of the Besieged than the Strength of the Place The Governour despairing of Succours and growing destitute of Provision and Ammunition demanded a Capitulation The vigourous D  fence he had made was alike glorious to him and advantageous for his Party for it effectually hindered the Enemies from undertaking any thing considerable during the Remainder of the Campaign The Enemies doing Justice to his Valour and good Conduct allowed him very honourable Conditions Our Voluntiers finding that the Season was far advanced and that they were not likely to have any more Opportunities of signalising themselves took the Road back to  Paris  making short Journies But it is now Time to see how the Countess of  Berci  employed herself during the Absence of her Lord  A few Days after his Departure from  Beauplan  she set out for  Burgundy  with two of her Women and a Gentleman whom the  Count had left to attend her She stopped at an Inn at  Auxerre  and as she entered the House saw a young Lady who seemed to be just alighted also standing at the Window Madam  de Berci  thought her extremely handsome and was desirous of having the Pleasure of her Company during the Time they staid there she sent to beg the Favour they might dine together The young Lady gladly accepted the Invitation and entering the Countess's Apartment both were pleasingly surprised to see each other for in effect this young Lady whom the Countess did not know at a Distance was Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  with whom the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  was in Love  They embraced with mutual Satisfaction and after the first Compliments each asked the other where she was travelling and were infinitely pleased to find that great Part of their Journey they might be together After Dinner they were informed that their Coaches were ready but the Countess insisted upon Mademoiselle  de Montmartin's  coming into her's their Women being all accommodated in the young Lady's Coach Madam  de Berci  and she had the Pleasure of conversing together without Restraint  As soon as they had left  Auxerre  the Countess informed Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  of the Occasion of this Journey she told her that in the Company of her Father and Mother  she was going to seek some Consolation for the Grief which her Lord's and her Brother's Absence had given her who she added were gone to make a Campaign in  Holland  Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  knew this as well as the Countess for the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and Monsieur  de Morigny  had both wrote to her before their Departure from  Beauplan  to inform her of their intended Expedition and to take their Leaves of her She was almost as much afflicted as the Countess and was going into the Country to bewail her Lover's Absence and to conceal the Interest she took in it However she affected to be surprised at the News expressing a great Esteem for the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  had she said Love she would but have done Justice to those Sentiments she felt for him but on such Occasions young Ladies generally shew they can be very secret And indeed she had dissembled her Thoughts with so much Art that neither the Marquis or Monsieur  de Morigny  had ever Reason to flatter himself with being prefered To this Conduct of her's was owing the Dispute which terminated in their Duel at  Fontainebleau  for each supposing the other more happy than himself both were enraged and thought themselves injured  However Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  was not quite so reserved with the Sister of her favourite Lover for though she would not confess that she loved the Marquis  de  SaintSauveur  yet she acknowledged with a graceful Modesty that notwithstanding Monsieur  de Morigny  had great Merit yet he would never be her Choice This was enough to assure the Countess who did not want Penetration that one Lover was rejected in Favour of the other She knew her Sex too well to expect a farther Explanation from one so modest as Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  and sensible how obliging such an Declamation was for her Brother she only answered it by tender Caresses to shew that she understood it so  Mademoiselle de  Montmartin  was absolutely ignorant of the Chevalier  des Essar's  Passion for the Countess as well as the great Esteem she had for him They discoursed about the Duel between the Rivals Mademoiselle  de Montmantin  praised the Valour and Generosity of the Chevalier in very high Terms and the Countess was not sorry that she had an Opportunity of talking of him both of them had great Obligations to him No Conversation is so delightful as that on a beloved Object These Ladies sufficiently proved the Truth of that Observation for the Count the Chevalier and the Marquis afforded them a Subject so copious that although they talked of nothing else during that Day's Journey yet when they came to part at Night they seemed to have a great deal more to say The Countess and Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  embraced each other tenderly and vowed an  inviolable Friendship Madam  de Berci  promised to be in  Paris  at the Expiration of two Months from whence she did not intend to remove till her Lord's Arrival Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  on her Side assured her that she would join her there about that Time and intreated her to write to her frequently promising to be as punctual as possible in her Answers  The Countess of  Berci  continuing her Journey arrived three Days afterwards at her Father's Estate where she was received with the highest Testimonies of Joy Her Mother who had not seen her since her Marriage held her a long Time embraced in her Arms bedewing her fair Face with Tears of Tenderness and Delight Madame  de Berci  as soon as these first Transports of their Meeting were subsided acquainted her Parents with her Lord's and her Brother's Departure to  Holland  and that it was the Chevalier  des Essars  who had persuaded them to this Expedition to which she had been obliged to consent  God grant said the old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  with lifted Eyes that their safe Return may put an End to your Fears and ours My Daughter added the good old Man you recal to my Remembrance a Man who will ever be dear to me his Welfare next to that of my Wife and Children is what I take most Interest in I dread lest his immoderate Courage should expose  him to Dangers no human Force can surmount for all that Man can do he can he saved my Life once by his Valour and he saved it a second time by preserving your Brother it will never be in my Power to make him a sufficient Return for Benefits of this Nature  The Countess durst not trust herself so far as to answer this Discourse of her Father's she dreaded lest she should say too much on so pleasing a Subject she therefore artfully turned the Conversation upon her meeting with Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  at  Auxerre  She extolled the Merit and Beauty of that young Lady and expressed an ardent Wish that she might be so happy as to have her for a Sisterinlaw The old Marquis who knew her Family as also that she had a very large Fortune a Quality which in those Times as well as our own was of higher Estimation than all the Advantages of Wit Birth and Beauty was extremely well satisfied with his Son's Taste and approved of his Daughter's Proposal declaring that her Estate was a very good one and she was a very amiable Lady  In the mean time the Count of  Berci  who took every Opportunity of writing to his Wife and sending her News of every Thing that concerned him informed her of his Brother's being taken Prisoner by the Enemies and the Extremity to which he himself and  his Brotherinlaw would have been reduced but for the immediate Assistance they received from the Chevalier  des Essars  He acknowledged that he owed his Life to the Courage of that brave Man and that he had also preserved the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  a second time The Count gave a very circumstantial Account of the Danger they had been in and of the Valour and Conduct of his Friend who by a thousand brave Exploits had gained a never dying Reputation He intreated his Wife to be at  Paris  in a few Days where he hoped he should soon meet her  No my dear Daughter said her Mother transported with Admiration and Gratitude the Count must come and fetch you write to him to bring with him this wonderful Man This is the only Way we have to see him he is so great a Friend of your Lord's that he will not refuse to accompany him to  Burgundy  We will shew him by our Reception of him that although it is not in our Power to repay the inestimable Benefits he has conferred upon us yet that we can acknowledge them with the utmost Gratitude  The Countess could not but be very much affected with this new Proof of the Chevalier's Passion for her her Delicacy was not shocked at the grateful Tenderness she felt for a Man who had preserved her Husband His Generosity and the Disinterestedness of his Love seemed to authorise those favourable Sentiments she had for him The Praises her  Father and Mother bestowed upon him strengthened those Sentiments and it was with Difficulty that she forbore joining in their Eulogiums on this brave Man with an Ardour that might have betrayed her Secret She reflected with Astonishment on the strange Effects of Fortune which continually furnished him with new Arms to take as it were her Heart by Force She became sensible at length that she loved the Chevalier A Crime which though involuntary she would not have pardoned in herself had she not resolved to die rather than do any thing that could wound her Duty or throw a Blemish upon her Fame  After she had continued some Weeks at her Father's she had Affairs to solicit at Court which required that she should be there as soon as possible The Marquis and his Lady used a thousand Efforts to detain her with a Hope of having soon the Company of their Soninlaw and the Chevalier  des Essars  but the Countess could not be prevailed upon Although the Care of her Affairs had indeed less Part in her Eagerness to be gone than her Impatience to meet her Lord and perhaps a secret Wish to see the Chevalier besides she had promised Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  to be at  Paris  within two Months and the Time drew very near that young Lady was already there and had wrote to the Countess to remind her of her Promise  Madam  de Berci  took a tender Farewel of her Parents who believing they saw her for the last time were dissolved in Tears and Grief the Countess was not less afflicted and with Difficulty disengaging herself from their Arms she threw herself into her Coach in a silent Agony of Grief  Having met with no Accidents or Delays in her Journey she arrived at  Paris  on the tenth of  September  She employed all the remaining Part of the Time her Lord continued at the Siege of  Rhineburg  in soliciting the Affair she had at Court Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  hardly ever left her nothing could be more tender and sincere than the Friendship between these two Ladies Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  felt the Absence of the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  less severe when she was in the Company of his charming Sister and Madam  de Berci  could indulge her Tenderness by talking of the Chevalier  des Essars  to Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  who considering him as the Preserver of her Lover's Life was never tired of hearing his Praises  The Ladies had Lodgings near the Arsenal where the young Nobility diverted themselves every Day with Tilting and other martial Sports and these bloodless Wars were often a pleasing Amusement to them One Day they were informed that some Foreigners who  were just arrived at  Paris  had challenged some of the Courtiers to break a Lance with them as was the Custom in the gallant Reign of  Henry  IV The King who supposed these Foreigners to be  Englishmen  a Nation he had a high Esteem for resolved to honour this Combat with his Presence the whole Court came to the Arsenal and our two Friends did not fail likewise to be there The Foreigners made good their Challenge a long Time against several Lords of the Court but one amongst them soon drew all the Attention of the Spectators He gave so many Proofs of an uncommon Courage and Address that one of the bravest Men of the Court and a great Favourite of the King's flattering himself that he could revenge the Defeat of the other Lords by overcoming his Vanquisher advanced fiercely against him however he had soon Cause to repent of his Presumption for after several vigourous Efforts to overthrow his Adversary the Stranger weary of a Resistance to which he had not been accustomed collecting all his Strength gave him so furious a Blow that he fell groveling on the Ground  The Courtier was slightly wounded by the Lance and although the King was soon informed that his Hurt was not dangerous yet he was so much concerned at an Accident so mortifying for his Favourite that he commanded the Sports should cease and sending for the Challengers desired they would make  themselves known They obeyed with a profound Reverence to the King and taking off their casques discovered to him that they were his own Subjects  The King and the whole Court soon knew them to be the same brave Men who three Months before had left  Paris  to go and shut themselves up in  Rhineburg  and indeed they were no other than the Chevalier  des Essars  and his two noble Friends they had arrived that very Day from  Holland  and had agreed to signalize their Entry into  Paris  by some gallant Adventure  The King was extremely pleased to see them again and was better satisfied that his Favourite and his Courtiers should be overcome by their own Countrymen than Foreigners He said a great many obliging Things upon their Valour and Success and after conferring with them upon some Particulars relating to the Siege of  Rhineburg  and declaring that he was highly pleased with their Conduct he returned to the  Louvre  and left them in the midst of the Ladies  In the mean time the Praises that were given to the Chevalier  des Essars  resounded from every Part and had Glory been the predominant Passion in his Soul he might have been extremely happy but he was wholly taken up with the Thoughts of his lovely Countess whom he was every where  seeking with his Eyes The Impatience that was visible in his Countenance and that Absence of Mind which made him insensible to every thing that passed had there been Leisure for Observation might have betrayed his Secret At length he discovered the Place where Madam  de Berci  was he pointed her out with a joyful Emotion to the Count and they immediately advanced to salute her while the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and Monsieur  de Morigny  flew eagerly to kiss the Hands of Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  who was with her that young Lady was in great Perplexity how to behave in such a manner to these Rivals as might not excite the Jealousy of either by a Preference too remarkable And though her Heart declared for the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  yet she received Monsieur  de Morigny  with equal Appearance of Satisfaction  The Count of  Berci  having embraced the Countess his Wife presented the Chevalier  des Essars  to her and casting a tender Regard upon him said  Madam it is to this brave Man this truly generous Friend that you owe the safe Return of your Husband and your Brother to him we are obliged for the Happiness of seeing you again Pay your Acknowledgments here and by your grateful Reception of our Preserver shew your Estimation of the Benefits he has conferred upon you  It is not the only time replied the Countess sweetly blushing that the Chevalier by the Greatness of his Services to us has made all Thanks poor and infinitely below the Obligations we have to him and if it is not in our Power to repay such noble Acts with any thing farther than such Sentiments as the highest Gratitude inspires he will like Heaven be contented with Thanks and Praise since Virtue is always its own greatest Reward  The Chevalier understood the full Force of this Answer which probably the Count might think a little extravagant  Madam answered he the Services I have been so happy as to render you are only considerable with respect to their Motive and their Objects and to which Fortune has contributed more than any thing else but were they much greater than they are I should think them too well rewarded by the Honour you do me of appearing sensible of them  The Count during this Speech had been making his Compliments to Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  and the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  then found Time to salute his Sister and to present Monsieur  de Morigny  to her after which the Count giving his Hand to the young Lady while the Chevalier had the Happiness of leading the charming Countess they went altogether to Madam  de Berci's  Lodgings  which were but a small Distance from thence  The Countess detained Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  to Supper as likewise some other Ladies her Friends who being informed of the Count's Return came to take Part in her Joy After Supper several of the Count's Friends coming in the Chevalier  des Essars  left him amongst them and joined the Ladies who had formed a little Cabal by themselves The Discourse now turned wholly upon Gallantry One of the Ladies who had a great deal of Vivacity asked the Chevalier if Insensibility was the necessary Consequence of uncommon Courage and whether Love and Glory were incompatible  To tell you the Truth added she we are all very unhappy to find that our Charms have yet made no Impression upon your Heart And since as we find by your Example that Hero's are sensible to no other Passion but Ambition we are in Danger of having either no Adorers at all or such as will do us no Honour  The Countess and the Chevalier could not help smiling at this Speech Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  finding the Chevalier silent turned to the Lady who had made the Attack upon him  We find Madam said she that the Hero's of old were proud of surrendering their Arms to Love and those Laurels they had gained with such Danger  in the Field were generally offered to some Fair ones at their Return why then should you imagine that the Chevalier would think Love a Blemish to his Glory when they imagined it added Glory to theirs As for me I declare I believe him to be as much in Love as any of those great Men but infinitely more discreet and his great Care to conceal his Flame from all Eyes but those which have kindled it is a Proof with me that it is so much the more violent and lasting  Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  would not have railled the Chevalier in this manner had she had the least Suspicion of his Passion for the Countess she had no other Design in it but to keep up the Mirth of the Conversation The Countess knew not what to think when the Chevalier recovering a little from the Perplexity into which this Discourse had thrown him said  If there is no Heart Madam but what some Time or other is sensible of the Force of Love mine if it had kept its Freedom hitherto would certainly lose it now amidst so many Charms but grant I am in Love what would it avail me to confess a Flame for which I cannot hope for any Remedy  Perhaps Monsieur said Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  the Beauty for whom you languish in secret wants only such a Confession  to make her pity and reward your Love  The Countess was now more alarmed than before and apprehensive that her Silence might make it suspected that she was too much interested in this Discourse addressed herself to the Chevalier with an Air so unreserved and easy as might have blinded the most penetrating View'  If I was acquainted with this haughty Beauty Monsieur said she and was assured that I had any Influence over her I would never cease to importune her till she had rendered Justice to your Valour and Merit I am persuaded the rest of these Ladies are as much inclined to favour you and would readily join their Endeavours with mine to serve you If then you would make use of our Assistance you must tell us the Name of this powerful Beauty who has had the Glory to triumph over such a Heart that we may all plead your Cause myself particularly in Acknowledgment for the Services I have received from you  It was plain the Countess relied greatly on the Chevalier's Wit and Discretion or she could not have gone so far he answered her Expectations and taking the Word with a Grace that suffered not any Embarrassment to be perceived  Madam said  he there is so great a Disproportion between the Merit of the Lady I love and my own that I dare not hope for any Return to my Passion However I am so highly obliged by the Offer you have generously made me and I owe you so much Respect and Obedience that although I had determined not to disclose her Name yet if you command me I will reveal it to you upon Condition that you will promise me Madam never to discover the Secret  It is impossible to accept of your Condition interrupted the Countess smiling how little do you understand our Sex if you think we would not rather lose the Pleasure of hearing a Secret than be under the horrible Restraint of keeping it but I believe continued she that we have really carried our Curiosity too far It would be inhuman to rally you any more and we will content ourselves with knowing that you are in Love without desiring you to name the Object  The Chevalier made no Reply but taking up a Lute that lay upon a Table he touched the Strings with such Art as shewed he was a perfect Master of that Instrument and joining to it his Voice he sung a melting Air which expressed all the Fervour of his Passion The Company drawn by the Sweetness of his Voice began to gather round  him The Ladies who remarked the Purport of the Song which lamented a hopeless Love and saw his Eyes swimming in tender Languishment sighing at every Pause with sympathetic Sorrow were persuaded that he was indeed a Lover and that he was unfortunate  The Countess was so affected with this musical Complaint which she understood perfectly well that it was with Difficulty she restrained her Tears and not daring to meet her Lover's Eyes with so much Softness in her own she turned them on her Lord calling up all her Virtue and her Fortitude to resist the soft Emotions that filled her Breast The Chevalier had scarce ended his Song when a Page entered the Room and desired to speak with him He rose up and Madam  de Berci  who followed him with her Eyes saw that the Page delivered a Message to him in a Whisper after which the Chevalier making an Excuse to the Company for leaving them followed the little Emissary down Stairs  The Countess found something in this mysterious Message sufficient to alarm her she suspected it was some Lady who had sent for the Chevalier That Love which had lain hid even from herself at the Bottom of her Heart flamed out in Jealousy at this Incident she felt Emotions which hitherto she had been a Stranger to a deadly Palenass  overspread her Face she trembled sighed and e'er she was aware the Tears started  om her Eyes Such extraordinary Agitasions must necessarily have awakened the Company's Suspicions had not the Accident that happened at that very Instant given a Colour to it by the general Terror and Grief with which all were seized  The Chevalier having as we have already said followed the Page down Stairs he rushed suddenly out of the Door that led to the Street and three Men advancing immediately to the Chevalier seized him and plunged their Poignards into his Body The Chevalier disengaging himself from their hold drew his Sword to defend himself but e'er he could execute his Intentions he received another Wound which depriving him at once of Sense and Motion he fell to the Ground The Assassins supposing him dead endeavoured to escape by the Door through which the Page had run out and which as they expected he had left open for them but the Boy in his Hurry and Confusion flung the Door after him so that the Murderers found themselves enclosed on every Side The Noise the Chevalier had made by strugling with them reached the Ears of some Servants who waited in the Antichamber near that the Company were in they ran hastily down Stairs and came just Time enough to see the Chevalier fall all bloody upon the Ground One of them running up Stairs again entered  the Room where the Company was and told them that the Chevalier  des Essars  had just been assassinated  Instantly the Count of  Berci  followed by his Brother and Messieurs  de SaintSauveur  and  Morigny  ran with their Swords drawn to the Hall they found their Friend bathed in his own Blood and lying senseless upon the Ground and the three Murderers who endeavoured to conceal themselves standing in a Corner of the Hall These Wretches seeing the imminent Danger they were in and that they could hope for no Mercy sought like Madmen the Count of  Berci  called to them to yield but finding them obstinate he and his two Friends soon dispatched them Two of them died upon the Spot and the third lived a few Moments after he fell but could not be prevailed upon to declare who he was and upon what Account he had joined in so villainous an Action  The House was full of Tumult and Disorder the Count's Servants having taken up the Chevalier carried him without Reflexion into the Room where the Ladies were they laid him on a Sopha and ran to fetch Surgeons What a sad Spectacle was this for the Countess of  Berci  her Lover pale bloody and disfigured with Wounds She stood gazing for a Moment upon him her Eyes seemed fixed her Feet rooted to the Ground then with a deep Groan she fell senseless into  the Arms of Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  who was near her and was carried into another Room where all the Remedies they applied to recover her were for some Time ineffectual  The Surgeons in the mean time examined the Chevalier's Wounds they pronounced them very dangerous they conferred together a few Moments in a Language unintelligible to any but themselves and then proceeded to apply their Dressings declaring that if the Chevalier recovered it would be little less than a Prodigy His Friends listened to this as to the Sentence of his Death and abandoned themselves to excessive Grief The Chevalier was put to Bed and continued all the rest of the Night in a Swoon Towards the Morning he began to recover his Senses but his Voice was so low that he could scarce be heard when he attempted to speak He had lost a great Quantity of Blood and with it all Remembrance of what had happened to him The Surgeons who visited him as soon as it was light ordered that he should not be allowed to see any Person or to speak but be kept as quiet as possible His Friends amidst their Anxiety for his Recovery used their utmost Endeavours to find out the Authors of so horrid a Villany After a strict Enquiry they discovered the Page who had brought the Message to the Chevalier and delivered him up to his Butchers He confessed that he and those Men  had been employed by a Kinsman of the King's Favourite who had been unhorsed in the Lists by the Chevalier the same Day he came to  Paris  The Friends of Monsieur  des Essars  full of Indignation and breathing Revenge went to the  Louvre  to complain of this Assassination to the King and to demand Justice on the Author of it It was but too probable that the Favourite himself who was likewise vanquished by the Chevalier was concerned in this black Affair however he disavowed it publicly and shewed great Concern for the Condition to which the Chevalier was reduced His Grief whether real or affected had such Marks of Sincerity in it as persuaded the King he was absolutely ignorant of the horrid Deed and being charmed at such a Conviction of his Innocence he obliged him and the Friends of the Chevalier to embrace in his Presence commanding them positively to take no other Measures to revenge him than those the Law allows  In the mean time the Favourite's Kinsman sought to secure his own Safety by Flight He went into another Country and never more durst venture to return to  France  But although the Favourite was justified in the King's Opinion yet the Public had not the same Indulgence for him nor equal Facility in believing his Professions The Chevalier had never had any declared Enemy and it was the general  Discourse that the false Shame of being vanquished had induced him to commit an Action so infamous and so unworthy of a brave Man  But let us now return to the unfortunate Countess of  Berci  When she had recovered her Senses and began to reflect on what had passed she found she had given very remarkable Testimonies of her Grief and Tenderness before several Witnesses all of whom she could not flatter herself were so taken up with their own Terror and Concern as not to observe them She trembled at the Interpretation her Lord might put upon her Behaviour but the Count of  Berci  who tenderly loved his Wife and who had not the least Suspicion of her Virtue attributed her sudden Fainting to the Terrors with which she was seized at the Sight of the Chevalier in that dreadful Condition and it was natural for her to be extremely afflicted for the Danger of one from whom she had received so many Services  He was the first to tell her that the Surgeons had some Hopes of his Recovery she was overjoyed at this News but the Apprehensions she still continued to be under that her Regard for the Chevalier was discovered embittered that Joy and filled her with Anxiety She dreaded lest her Brotherinlaw should form Suspicions injurious to her Virtue He indeed was but too well acquainted  with the Chevalier's Passion for the Countess' and did not fail to observe the Conduct of them both His Sisterinlaw's Fainting did not escape his Notice but whatever were his Thoughts about it he kept them shut up in his Heart and never took any Step that might give her Uneasiness or prejudice her in the Opinion of her Husband and notwithstanding his secret Envy of the Chevalier he always governed himself by those Principles of Generosity which were natural to him  As soon as the Chevalier was able to reflect upon the Adventure which had happened to him he employed his Mind incessantly in considering who could be the Author of it And as Lovers are ever torturing themselves with imaginary Evils he sometimes fancied that this secret Enemy who sought to take his Life by such shameful Methods was a Rival who flattered himself that it was he only who stood in his Way to Happiness This Thought gave him inexpressible Agonies he burnt with Desire to be revenged and Impatience and the Inquietude of his Mind greatly retarded his Recovery  The Count of  Berci  who came into his Chamber one Day when he was most disturbed with these Chimera's finding his Fever much higher and hearing him sigh and discover great Agitation of Mind  What is it that troubles you my dear Chevalier said this tender and faithful Friend Why  do you give way to any anxious Thoughts in the Condition you are in The Melancholy that oppresses you will be of dangerous Consequence to your Health and the Hopes the Surgeons have given us of your Life will be all blasted if you do not by calming your Mind contribute to your Cure Banish these Cares that disturb your own Quiet and afflict your Friends and be assured that you are already revenged of your Enemies if that Thought can give you any Relief  The Count then informed him of the Fate of his three Assassins but took Care not to own his Suspicions concerning the King's Favourite whom he had vanquished in the Lists the Day he arrived at  Paris  He was afraid that he would too soon be led by common Discourse and his own Reflexions to suspect him himself and knowing the Courage of his Friend he did not doubt but as soon as he had recovered his Strength he would take Vengeance on him for the base Attempt he had made upon his Life  The Chevalier would have answered the Count and expressed his Acknowledgment of the Friendship he discovered for him but Monsieur  de Berci  laying his Hand upon his Mouth conjured him to obey the Surgeons Directions who had earnestly recommended to him not to speak and tenderly urged him to contribute all in his  Power towards his Cure which was earnestly prayed for by his Friends The Chevalier then contented himself with pressing in an affectionate manner the Count's Hand which he held between his endeavouring by this Action to shew him how greatly he was affected with all those Instances he gave him of his Friendship He ardently wished to see the Countess her Presence would have been an effectual Relief to him but she was of a contrary Opinion She was afraid that the Sight of her might produce some dangerous Alteration she therefore contented herself with sending frequent Messages to know the State of his Health and to assure him of the great Interest she took in it  At the Expiration of fifteen Days the Surgeons declared that he was out of Danger and that they would answer for his Life The Count eager to communicate this good News to his Wife went instantly to her Apartment and congratulated his Brother and her upon the hopedfor Recovery of a Friend so dear to them all Madam  de Berci  could resist no longer the earnest Desire she had to see him but still fearful of surprising him she sent to let him know that she would visit him the next Day This Interval appeared an Age to the transported Chevalier he counted the Hours with Impatience and blessed every fleeting  Moment as it past which brought him nearer to his Happiness  The Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  accompanied the Countess in this Visit but they glad of an Opportunity to discourse together apart retired to one End of the Room as soon as they had paid their Compliments to the Chevalier and left the Countess alone at his Bedside The Chevalier at the Sight of her whom he loved with such Ardency forgot his Wounds and his Pain he attempted to raise himself in his Bed that he might in a less unbecoming Posture thank her for the Honour she did him Madam  de Berci  perceiving his Intention made a Motion with her Hand to hinder him The happy Chevalier immediately seized that charming Hand and the Countess not having Resolution enough to withdraw it at first he printed an ardent Kiss upon it but again offering to press it to his Lips she drew it back with Precipitation though with no Marks of Anger and this mute Conversation gave place to Acknowledgements on the Part of the Chevalier and Protestations of eternal Gratitude and Respect for her unmerited Goodness but all uttered with such apparent Disorder and in Language so unconnected as persuaded the Countess of the Fervour of his Love better than the most eloquent Discourse could have done She assured him on her Side that she had been  really afflicted at the Misfortune which had happened to him she intreated him to take Care of himself and not retard his Cure by any Impatience or Anxiety she said a thousand obliging Things to him and although she was a little offended at the Freedom he had used in taking her Hand so unexpectedly yet she would not in the weak Condition he was in discover any Resentment towards him but secretly resolved to avoid as much as possible all Opportunities of being alone with him lest a less pardonable Liberty should escape him And fearing he would endanger his Health by speaking too much if she protracted her Visit any longer she  o  e from her Chair and Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  and her Lover approaching she took Leave of him promising to see him soon again She kept her Word and visited him frequently but took Care to be as seldom as possible left alone at his Bedside her Presence advanced his Cure more than all the Surgeons Endeavours he felt no Pain when he saw her and even the Torments of his Mind were suspended while she was with him he  ound so much Sweetness in that soft and obliging Solicitude she expressed for his Recovery that he began to dread lest his Wound  should be cured too soon  Would to Heaven Madam said he to her one Day when she asked him how he was that I might continue still for Years in this Condition the highest Health has  not half so many Charms for me as these Wounds since they procure me the Blessing of seeing you and of being assured that you take some Interest in my Health  Although he spoke these Words very low so that they could only be heard by the Countess the rest of the Company who came with her to visit standing at some Distance in Discourse yet she blushed and was in great Confusion  You make an ill Use of my Condescension said she softly in Answer and you will force me to forbear my Visits unless you treat me with more Respect  These Words were severe enough to have given the Chevalier great Pain for nothing is so timid as a true Lover but a Smile which immediately after beamed over the fair Face of Madam  de Berci  and a parting Look she gave him which expressed more Compassion than Anger calmed his Fears and notwithstanding his Wishes to the contrary his Cure was soon perfected and he obliged through Decency to quit the Count of  Berci's  House and remove to his own  He now thought himself in a frightful Solitude Absence increased his Despair without diminishing his Love he had been so used to the Sight of the charming Countess every Day that he could not live without it When the Hour approached in which she and her Friends used to visit him he felt more sensibly the Want of that charming  Presence which while enjoyed annihilated his Torments He sought for Relief in Company and Amusements but in Crouds he was alone and in the midst of Pleasures absorbed in Melancholy Love pursued him every where but a Love without Hope and Reason which he sometimes called to his Aid when it represented to him that his Pursuit was fruitless increased his Despair but left his Passion more violent than before  Nor was the Countess without her Inquietudes Her Tenderness for the Chevalier though innocent was a perpetual Reproach to her in her own Mind Reason and Duty dictated to her that she ought to combat such Thoughts as seemed to incroach upon the Love she owed her Husband while on the other hand the Services she had received from the Chevalier demanded her Gratitude His unhappy Love excited her Compassion and his Merit forced her Esteem fain would she have persuaded herself that the Sentiments she had for him were authorised by the Obligations he had conferred on her whole Family but her Heart was pure and the Voice of Reason though not heard amidst the Tumult of unrestrained and lawless Passions yet is readily listened to by doubting Virtue Hence it followed that the Countess escaped all those Snares which the deluding Sophistry of Love laid for her And although she could not vanquish her Tenderness for the Chevalier yet looking upon  it as a Crime she lived in continual War with herself and kept her Will in Subjection if she could not her Thoughts The Conversation of Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  as it was tender and sensible and her Heart sincere was all the Comfort Madam  de Berci  had but this Lady was likewise far from being happy  The Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and Monsieur  de Morigny  still continued their Addresses to her their Jealousy notwithstanding their Endeavours to conceal it as well from her as from each other broke out in all their Looks and Actions She dreaded the Effects of it she loved the Marquis and she felt nothing but Indifference for Monsieur  de Morigny  nevertheless she was obliged to conceal her real Sentiments and treat them with equal Reserve  It is extremely difficult to act always in Opposition to our Inclinations and to a Mind naturally sincere and artless all Dissimulation is painful Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  suffered great Uneasiness from the continual Restraint she laid upon herself but she trembled lest she should be the Cause of a second Rupture between these friendly Rivals They haunted her perpetually they visited her together they followed her to all public Places and if to get rid of the Importunity of Monsieur  de Morigny  she sometimes refused to see him it was necessary likewise that she  should deprive herself of the Pleasure of seeing her beloved Marquis whose Destiny by the peculiar Unhappiness of her Situation was not more fortunate than that of his Rival It is true she might have freed herself from so cruel a Tyranny by declaring at once her Choice but terrified at what had lately happened she trembled lest the Rivals should again dispute the Possession of her with their Swords and the Loss of her beloved Marquis would then be unavoidable for if he did not perish by his Rival's Hand he could not a second time hope for a Pardon She resolved therefore to see neither of them till Time had produced some Alteration in their Minds and Absence from the Marquis seemed less painful to endure than the cruel Alternative of treating both with equal Indifference where one was so greatly preferred  Having taken her Resolution she told them when they came as usual to visit her that for very important Reasons which she could not at that Time explain to them she must desire they would forbear their Visits  The Lovers thunderstruck at so severe a Decree gazed on her some Moments in Silence The Marquis at length recovering from his first Consternation began to expostulate with her upon the Cruelty of her Proceeding Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  was greatly affected scarce could she restrain her  Tears and some Sighs in spite of her made their Way as she spoke to her Lover to whom she confirmed tho' with a faltering Voice his Sentence Her Emotion did not escape his Observation it gave Rise to various Reflexions in his Mind he turned from her and went to a Window where he stood ruminating upon what had passed  In the mean Time Monsieur  de Morigny  who had been so shocked with her cruel Prohibition that he had not been able to attend to what she said to his Rival began to urge her with the most vehement Intreaties to change her Resolution Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  found no Reluctance in herself to deny him she assured him with great Steadiness that she had taken it upon mature Deliberation and that nothing he could say would have Power to alter it The Marquis approaching her as she pronounced these Words told her that he would give her a convincing Proof of his Passion by paying an implicit Obedience to her Commands He bowed low as he finished these Words which Monsieur  de Morigny  looking upon as the Signal for going away only conjured her not to make the Time of their Banishment too long since it would be difficult for them to obey her and live and then taking a respectful Leave he followed the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and they both went out of the House together  The Chevalier  des Essars  saw them and perceiving an unusual Discomposure on their Countenances asked them the Reason of it They acquainted him with what had happened and intreated him to advise them how to act in such a perplexing Situation  The Chevalier very frankly told them it was their Part to obey he represented to them that the Extremities to which their Jealousy had formerly carried them was without Doubt the Cause which had induced Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  to banish them from her Presence and that it was that very Jealousy the Effects of which she dreaded now which had made them commit a Fault that to repeat would render them wholly inexcusable and at the same Time that it deprived them of the Esteem of their Mistress would infallibly draw upon them the Anger of their Prince who would not be again prevailed upon to pardon them He added that if they truly loved Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  they would leave her to the Freedom of making her Choice and not expose her to the Hatred of the Public by making her the Subject of new Quarrels and more Bloodshed and lastly he conjured them to remember their old Friendship which they had so lately renewed with mutual Oaths and not to resign themselves to the wild Rage of Jealousy which had already produced such dreadful Effects  They both assured him that although they could not renounce their Love for Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  yet they would obey her Orders whatever it cost them The Chevalier then obliging them to promise that neither of them would take any Measures to produce an Alteration in the Mind of Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  without acquainting each other they parted with a full Resolution to keep their Word  Accordingly for some Days they religiously observed the Promise by which they had bound themselves They were equally afraid of offending their Mistress and of giving each other any Occasion of Disgust They flattered themselves that in the variety of Amusements which are to be found in  Paris  they should meet with some Aleviation of their Grief But the Dissipation in which they lived could not banish the Idea of Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  from their Thoughts all Objects became disagreeable but that which they were forbidden to behold and which was nevertheless always present to their Imaginations  Monsieur  de Morigny  less politic or more impatient than the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  was the first who resolved to get rid of this tormenting Restraint He hired an Apartment opposite to the House where Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  lived believing it would be some Relief to him to be in a Place where  he might sometimes behold her at a Window or see her get in and out of her Coach He did not reflect upon the Consequences of this rash Step and falsely imagined that there was nothing in it contrary to the Obedience he had vowed to pay to the Orders of his Mistress nor to the Promise he had made to his Rival  The Marquis  de SaintSauveur  who had placed Spies upon Monsieur  de Morigny  which gave him an exact Information of his Conduct soon learned by one of them that his Rival was never to be found in his own House nor seen in any Place of public Diversion but spent all his Hours in an Apartment opposite to the House of the Lady they both loved which he had hired for the Conveniency of seeing her The Marquis easily saw that Monsieur  de Morigny  had no Intention to forget her and thinking himself dispensed with from keeping his Word with a Man who had first broke through his Engagements he resolved to derive some Advantages from this Breach of Faith in his Rival and endeavour to prevail upon Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  to repeal his Banishment Being informed the next Day that Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  was gone to the Thuilleries with another Lady he ordered his Coach in an Instant and drove thither determined to complain to her of Monsieur  de Morigny  's ungenerous Behaviour and intreat her to do him Justice He found it was the Countess of  Berci  his Sister who was with her which gave him more Courage to approach her after having paid his Compliments to her with great Respect he intreated her not to condemn him till she had heard him He told her it was true that by coming into her Presence contrary to her express Prohibition he appeared a Rebel to her Orders but he had such Reasons to urge in his Excuse as would he hoped justify him in her Opinion He then informed her of what Monsieur  de Morigny  had done he represented to her that it was not just his Rival should every Hour enjoy the Pleasure of seeing her while he languished in a cruel Banishment He hinted that if she did not admit the Justice of his Plea he should have Room to suspect that Monsieur  de Morigny  was more favoured than himself and perceiving that this Insinuation gave her some Emotion he pursued it with such Art and painted the Torments he endured during the Absence she had condemned him to in Colours so lively that Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  was moved she looked upon Monsieur  de Morigny  's Behaviour as an Instance of Disrespect to her and as a Breach of Honour to his Friend She thought herself affronted by his taking an Apartment so near her and as one is easily persuaded of the Guilt of those whom one dislikes Monsieur  de Morigny  's Conduct however innocent in itself to her prejudiced Mind appeared a Crime worthy of her utmost Rigor Nothing could have happened  more agreable to her Inclinations she loved the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and wanted a specious Pretence for recalling him She had now found such an Occasion as she had wished for the absent Lover was treated as a presumptuous Man who had disobeyed her Orders and was therefore condemned to perpetual Banishment while the happy Marquis was listened to favourably his Complaints acknowledged to be just and the Means he pursued to procure Satisfaction lawful It is not difficult to find Favour with a partial Judge The Marquis  de SaintSauveur  soon gained his Cause before this Tribunal at the Expence of the unfortunate  de Morigny  The Countess of  Berci  joined in her Brother's Request that he might be permitted to see her Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  at last consented to receive his Visits but with great Caution she flattered herself that their Meetings might be carried on so privately that Monsieur  de Morigny  notwithstanding he was so near a Neighbour might not be informed of them It was agreed that the Marquis should never come to her House till it was Night she was assured that his Passion was honourable and having the Sanction of his Sister's Concurrence to these private Interviews they thought there was nothing to apprehend on the Score of Scandal  Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  used to retire early to her Apartment and when her  Servants were in Bed her Woman who was well paid by the Marquis for her Secresy always introduced him into the House where he generally staid an Hour or two with his Mistress For some Time these happy Lovers continued undisturbed in the Possession of that Liberty they had so long wished for of seeing and declaring to each other their mutual Tenderness But it is a difficult thing to deceive a jealous Man long he is the Argos of the Fable his hundred Eyes are continually open and no Charms are able to close one of them for a Moment  It happened that the Marquis coming one Morning at three o'Clock out of the House of Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  that young Lady that she might have the Pleasure of seeing him a Moment longer looked out of the Window after her Lover who was then in the Street The Moon shone bright and the unhappy  de Morigny  who was too much in Love to sleep soundly hearing some little Noise in the Street ran to his Window and softly opening it he had the Mortification to see his Rival taking Leave of his Mistress with Expressions which shewed he was in a Situation very different from his and to hear Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  answer him with great Tenderness But as if this was not enough to torment the unfortunate  Morigny  and that nothing should be wanting to compleat his Despair the Marquis took it into his Head to intreat Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  to throw him some Trifle out of the Window that he might have the Pleasure to have something in his Possession that Night which belonged to her  Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  refused to grant this Request at first and turned it into Ridicule but the Marquis prest her so earnestly that at last she tossed him a white Handkerchief she had in her Hand however it was less in compliance with what she thought a silly Request than her Desire to get him away least by staying longer in the Street some unlucky Chance might discover him to his Rival The Marquis catched the Handkerchief she threw him and kissing it made a profound Bow to his Mistress wishing her as happy as he should be that Night with such a Favour in his Possession and then departed  Monsieur  de Morigny  heard and saw all that past Rage and Despair had almost deprived him of his Senses he was several Times upon the Point to rush out upon his happy Rival and sacrifice him to his just Revenge before the Eyes of his Mistress and by one last Combat decide the Fate of his Life and Love But he was withheld almost in Spite of himself by his eager Desire to see and hear all but when he saw the Marquis go away he cursed his Imprudence and his Folly for suffering him to escape without taking a severe Revenge upon him for the Injury he  had done him He then comforted himself with the Thought of demanding Satisfaction of his false Friend the next Day and threw himself upon his Bed full of the hoped for Vengeance But when this first Fury gave way to calmer Reflexions he found that he was miserable that he had nothing to hope for from Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  and that the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  was beloved Grief now took the Place of Fury and a Thirst of Vengeance He could not think of losing Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  for ever without Agonies not to be described he gave way a while to these first Transports of Despair and Death seemed to be his only Resource But the Mind amidst the most violent Pangs of Sorrow naturally turns itself towards any possibility of Relief he began to reflect upon the extreme Indifference Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  had always shewn him he blamed himself for entertaining Hopes unjustly founded and concluded that if he had not blinded himself by those intoxicating Expectations his Passion would not have gained such Strength He considered whether an Attempt to subdue it might not still be successful and if the Despair to which he was reduced might not by a proper Exertion of his Reason be productive of his Cure The first Fruit of these Thoughts was a salutary Shame for his own Weakness he blushed for having given way to Transports unworthy of a Man of Sense and Courage The Marquis's Behaviour  seemed now not quite so unjustifiable as he had at first conceived it to be since he was capable of acknowledging to himself that he had deserved such an Advantage should be taken of him by breaking his Word to him solemnly given in Presence of the Chevalier  des Essars  not to take any Measures to see Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  Her Behaviour to the Marquis shewed that she had always loved him and convinced him that his own Addresses had been always disagreeable to her and that any farther Pursuit would not only be fruitless but add to his Rival's Triumph and his own Disgrace  What signifies my Sighs said he to himself they are despised while my Rival's are heard with a tender Sympathy and while I pass my Nights in Misery and Complaints he is happy in the Sight and Conversation of his Mistress who uses no Precaution in those Testimonies she gives him of her Love Is it not more consistent with my Honour and my Quiet to sacrifice a Passion so odious and despised to Reason and to Friendship than prosecute an unjust Revenge and solicit a hopeless Love Can I expect to snatch her Heart by Violence The Marquis and she are united by the most tender Ties will my Rage and my Complaints break them Were it in my Power to render them miserable should I be more happy or rather should I not be  far more wretched by the Consciousness of the Injury I did them  Monsieur  de Morigny  found Tranquility steal upon his Soul as he pursued these Reflexions his Passion lost its Force in Proportion as he exercised his Reason and he resolved at length to renounce those Hopes which had hitherto made up all his Happiness and conquer that Passion which was always his Misfortune and would now under such Convictions be his Crime  A Change so sudden although not frequent is nevertheless not impossible and would be oftener effected if the still Voice of Reason be listened to the base Subjection we live in to our own Desires is the Effect of our Pusillanimity We need only to fight to be acquainted with our Strength if Love so often engages us with Success it is because we find him Arms against ourselves and he is strong only in our Weakness Love is an Enemy whom it is no Disgrace to shun against him Flight is Victory his first Approaches are always dangerous Distance only can secure our Safety and make our Triumph glorious  Monsieur  de Morigny  was convinced of this Truth he took Care not to expose himself again to the Danger of seeing Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  he knew his own Weakness and her Power He was persuaded that all  the wise Resolutions he had taken would vanish in her Presence He therefore returned to his own House and avoided Company and public Places as much as possible that he might have no Opportunity of seeing or bearing of that fatal Beauty whom it was now his Business to forget Monsieur  de Morigny  had always a pious Turn Disappointments in worldly Affairs have often contributed greatly towards making a devout Christian he applied himself to religious Books for Consolation in his Misfortunes In this Study he found not only what he sought Resignation and Peace but they also inspired him with a Zeal suitable to his Years and Condition an active Zeal which laid the Foundation of a Design to which the brightest Actions of his Life were owing He resolved to consecrate his future Days to the Service of Religion by fighting against its most redoutable Enemy who by his own Strength and the vast Extent of Dominion which he had usurped was still less dreadful to Christendom than by the Disunion and different Interests of Christian Princes The barbarous  Othoman  infested at that Time the Seas by his Pirates the most inhuman Outrages were every Day committed by them with impunity the Cities of  Algiers  and  Tunis  were filled with the unhappy Victims of their Cruelty and Rapine who groaned in Chains and languished out their Lives in the utmost Misery  Monsieur  de Morigny  felt a generous Compassion for these unhappy Sufferers he was desirous of associating himself with those brave and pious Knights who bound themselves by solemn Vows to consecrate their Labours to the Service of Religion and who swore upon the Altar an eternal Hatred to the Infidels and to maintain a continual War against them The Order of the Religious of  Saint John  of  Jerusalem  was then a Nursery fruitful in great Men and valiant Warriors An End so noble and a Vocation so eminent were conformable to the martial Inclinations of Monsieur  de Morigny  his Zeal increased every Day and he resolved not to defer any longer his Entrance into that Order which was both a military and religious one He prepared therefore for a speedy Departure for  Malta  in order to take the Cross and having settled his Affairs he reserved only a small Pension for himself destining all the rest of his Estate which was very large to the Redemption of Christian Slaves as the noblest Use he could make of his Riches  When all was finished he sent Invitations to his Friends to require they would meet at his House he then in few Words acquainted them with his Design which he was ready to put into Execution immediately and addressing himself particularly to the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  I render Thanks to Heaven said he for having conducted me safely to a happy Port from whence I may contemplate securely the Shipwrecks of Love May you my dear Marquis be happy with Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  I no longer envy your good Fortune you are more worthy of her than I am I have now ceased to be your Rival but shall always be your Friend  This Speech greatly moved the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and the Chevalier  des Essars  they made some Efforts to retain him in  Paris  and to prevail upon him to quit a Resolution which they attributed to Despair but he steadily resisted all their Intreaties and having tenderly embraced them he took Leave of them and after a prosperous Voyage arrived safely af  Malta  He performed his Caravanes for so they call the first Sea Expeditions of the new Knights of  Malta  in which he gave to the new Order he had embraced and to all Christendom several glorious Testimonies of his Zeal and of his Valour against the common Enemy  Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  could not hear of his Departure without being moved and gave some Tears to the Memory of a Man who by her Rigour had been forced to embrace a Life so dangerous and austere Nothing now seemed to oppose the good Fortune of the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  he had  wholly resigned himself to the most flattering Hopes when that young Lady by a Conduct as capricious as it was cruel forbid him all on a sudden to visit her  The Marquis in the utmost Uneasiness and Surprise at such an unexpected Stroke used every Argument that Love could suggest to prevail upon her to revoke so unjust and cruel a Command but all was in vain he was forced to submit And such was his Submission to her Will that although in his Heart he could not but condemn the fair Tyrant for her unreasonable Conduct yet he did not complain nor make any Attempts to break a Chain which she was resolved to render so heavy  Mean Time the Chevalier  des Essars  being perfectly recovered of his Wounds made frequent Visits to the Count of  Berci  still fancying that the Sight of his lovely Mistress would alleviate his Pains while in reality that Sight only strengthened his Disease when Chance afforded him an Opportunity of speaking to her in private the Violence of his Passion would sometimes force him to make Complaints of her Rigor and his own Unhappiness but these Complaints always drew upon him severe Reproaches from the Countess whose only Consolation it was amidst the Uneasiness in which she was plunged that she religiously adhered to the Duty she owed her Lord  Are you not she would say the most unjust Man in the World when you accuse me of Ingratitude and Cruelty How can I listen to you without being cruel to myself and without being ungrateful and base to a Husband who loves me with the tenderest Affection Ah Monsieur you lose all the Glory of the great Benefits I have received from you by expecting a Reward which my Duty forbids me to give If you have saved the Lives of my Father my Husband and my Brother is it just that I should load them with Infamy and dishonour myself in Return for those Obligations Do not imag  ne that all your Services can make me think myself authorised to grant you Favours inconsistent with the Fidelity I owe my Lord Alas my own Conscience condemns me for having heard the Declarations you have made me but much more for being too sensible of your Misfortune in loving me Hope not in Spite of this Confession of my Weakness to triumph over me my Virtue and my Duty will always furnish me with Arms against you Make then a generous Effort yourself and restrain your Passion within such Bounds that you may not for the future indulge a Wish which may alarm my Virtue and make me blush for my own Weakness if not for my Guilt  The Chevalier could not help acknowledging the Reasonableness of her Arguments and  these Conversations always ended by Repentance on his Side and new Assurances of never offending her with such presumptuous Complaints for the future  But he did not long enjoy the Happiness of seeing his Mistress and declaring to her the Excess of his Passion new Misfortunes tore him soon after from the Presence of her who was so dear to him and then it was that a fatal Experience shewed him that a hopeless Absence was a Torment greater than any he had yet felt  In effect whatever Precautions his Friends used to prevent his entertaining any Suspicions of the Person who had attempted to get him assassinated he was at length brought to his Knowledge and at a Time when he had lost all Remembrance of the Injury as well as the Desire of Revenge  One of those busy Sycophants who swarm in Courts meeting the Chevalier one Day told him with great Appearance of Friendship and Regard for his Honour that the Public were astonished at the Patience with which he bore the Injury offered him by the Count of  Polan  for so I shall call the King's Favorite who was indeed the real Author of that detestable Attempt to assassinate the Chevalier  des Essars  He added that although he was convinced it was owing to his Generosity and Greatness of Soul that he did not  take a Revenge suitable to the Wrong that had been done him yet that the Court judged otherwise and attributed the extreme Indifference he shewed in an Affair which so nearly concerned his Honour to his Fear of offending the King whose Fondness for the Count was well known but that no Consideration whatever ought to oblige him to pass over quietly such a glaring Injury and that it was necessary he should take some Resolution immediately to silence Reports so injurious to his Reputation  The Chevalier  des Essars  who at first could not comprehend what the Man meant by talking to him of the Count of  Polan  and the Revenge it was expected he should take of him made him repeat what he had said The busy Courtier then gave him a long Account of all what had passed He exaggerated many Circumstances and added many more and finally assured him that it was the Count of  Polan  who had employed Assassins to murder him in Revenge for having defeated him in the Tournament  The Chevalier had Wisdom and Discretion he was not willing to be precipitated into an Affair of such Consequence and was resolved before he proceeded any farther to examine into it more carefully He went immediately to the House of Monsieur  de Berci  and taking him aside reproached  him for his Secresy and Reserve which had had Consequences that could not but be prejudicial to his Character he then recounted to him all that he had just heard and conjured him earnestly to tell him all he knew without Disguise or Palliation  The Count of  Berci  was thrown into great Perplexity by this Demand he endeavoured to remove his Suspicions of the Count of  Polan  but he could not deny that the Public had the same The Chevalier persuaded that they were but too well founded both by the Flight of the Count of  Polan's  Kinsman with whom he never had any Quarrel and likewise by the Favourite's cool Behaviour towards him which argued a secret Disgust resolved to be revenged but in the mean Time he carefully concealed his Intentions and seeming to be quite convinced that the Informations he had received were false the Count of  Berci  thought the Affair entirely over and did not apprehend any fatal Consequence from his Resentment But he was mistaken the Chevalier under the Appearance of great Composure breathed nothing but Fury and Revenge Nevertheless the Resolution he had taken to challenge the Count of  Polan  occasioned some disagreeable Reflexions Whatever Way it was terminated he was sure to lose the Sight of his beloved Countess and draw upon himself the Anger of his King who would consider him as doubly criminal by transgressing the Law  against Duelling for which he had once been pardoned and by outraging him in the Person of a Man whom he greatly esteemed but the Chevalier eager for Revenge could neither be influenced by the Voice of Love or Ambition As soon as he returned home he wrote the following Billet to the Count of  Polan  charging his Gentleman whom he sent with it to deliver it into the Count's own Hand  'The Chevalier  DES ESSARS  to the Count 'of  POLAN  If the King influenced by his great Affection for you and his own Generosity has been prevailed upon to acquit you in his own Thoughts of the base Attempt which was lately made upon my Life yet my just Suspicions and those of the Public are not yet effaced The Flight of your Kinsman is a sufficient Proof that he acted by your Orders and leaves me no other Part to take but to address myself to you to demand Satisfaction for the Injury I have received from your Emissaries The Person who brings you this will tell you the Place where you are expected alone by  '  the Chevalier  DES ESSARS'  The Count of  Polan  was still in Bed when the Chevalier's Gentleman desired Admittance to him he was told that the Count was not up but he intreated that he might  be waked immediately because he had an Affair to communicate to him of the utmost Consequence The Count's Servant being thus pressed informed his Master immediately who ordered the Gentleman to be admitted and receiving the Billet he brought read it in his Bed without betraying the least Emotion then desiring the Chevalier's Gentleman to wait a Moment he took a Pen and wrote this Answer  'The Count of  POLAN  to the Chevalier  'DES ESSARS  You prevent me in the Demand you have made and without entering here into any Explanation concerning the Injury you complain of know that I only waited for the Reestablishment of your Health to prove if you are as fortunate with the Sword as you have been with the Lance Be in the appointed Place at the Hour you mention and depend upon seeing immediately with an Ardor equal to your own  '  the Count of  POLAN'  The Chevalier's Gentleman having delivered this Answer to his Master who felt a new Accession to his Fury he mounted his Horse and attended only by his Gentleman rode instantly to the Back of  le Bois de Boulogne  where he had soon the Satisfaction to see his Adversary arrive followed only by  his Gentleman likewise They both dismounted immediately the two Gentlemen received their Horses and were Spectators of a long and obstinate Combat The Count and the Chevalier stript themselves to their Shirts as was the Custom at that Time and with a gloomy Silence and Eyes sparkling with Fury rushed upon each other for above a Quarter of an Hour they fought with equal Ardor and equal Success The Chevalier  des Essars  by so long a Resistance found that he had to do with one of the most valiant Men in the World he had never before met with an Enemy worthy of his Courage and Strength Fortune always favourable to him would not abandon him on an Occasion so pressing the Count stumbling over a Stone that lay in his Way was put into some Disorder the Chevalier closing with him instantly gave him a mortal Wound he fell to the Earth and a few Moments afterwards expired in the Arms of his Gentleman  The Chevalier  des Essars  mounted his Horse the Moment he saw his Antagonist fall and rode to  Paris  with the utmost Haste that he might get there before the Count's Death could be known He alighted at his own House and after he had taken what Money he thought he should have Occasion for he went immediately to that of the Count of  Berci  he related to him in brief what had happened and his Design of retiring immediately into  Flanders  The Count of  Berci  opposed this Scheme and advised him to go immediately to an Estate which he had in the Heart of  Anjou  where it was not probable he would be searched for he assured him he might remain there in Security till the King informed of the Justice of his Cause and the Reasonableness of his Resentment might be prevailed on to grant him a Pardon The Chevalier approving of this Expedient the Count wrote a Letter to the Steward of his Castle in which he commanded him to accommodate the Chevalier in the best manner he could and charged him upon Pain of losing his Place not to discover to any one that he was concealed there  The Chevalier embraced his dear Count with the utmost Tenderness and thanked him for his friendly Solicitude for his Safety he left in his Hands a Copy of his Letter to the Count of  Polan  with that unhappy Nobleman's Answer to it that they might if necessary be shewn to the King He then recommended to him the Care of his private Affairs in  Paris  and took Leave of him with another ardent Embrace The Countess advancing to bid him Farewel he could only by his Eyes and a heart breaking Sigh as he kissed her Hand express the Grief he felt at being thus torn from her Madam  de Berci  saw his Emotion and after she had with a faltering Voice wished him Health and Safety she retired to her Chamber to give free vent to her Tears  Mean time the Count of  Polan's  Gentleman having dispatched a Man who accidentally passed by to  Paris  for a Coach he placed the Body of his Lord in it and carried him thither The whole Court was soon informed of the Count's Death but very few Persons were concerned for it as it was not doubted but he was the Contriver of the Chevalier  des Essar's  designed Assassination on the contrary the brave Revenge which the Chevalier had taken was highly approved and the more as he was entitled by the Count's Baseness towards him to have attempted his Life without endangering his own But the King who had loved the Count with great Tenderness and who had never entertained the slightest Suspicion of his Guilt was excessively enraged against the Chevalier  des Essars  he ordered the most diligent Search to be made for him and protested his Life should pay the Forfeit due to his violated Laws  The Countess of  Berci  was greatly afflicted at this Inflexibility of the King's she foresaw that the unhappy Chevalier would be obliged to undergo a long and perhaps perpetual Banishment from his native Country her Compassion for the sad Fate of a Man who so well deserved to be happy augmented her Tenderness and her Mind as if it had a Foreboding of her approaching Misfortunes fell insensibly into a Melancholy that made all Company and Diversions irksome to her  Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  was the only Person she saw with Pleasure their Friendship continued always tender and sincere notwithstanding the Countess would sometimes reproach her with her Rigour to the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  her Brother at a Time when nothing seemed to oppose his Happiness  Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  in Excuse for herself alledged that the Noise Monsieur  Morigny  's Resolution had made gave Occasion for very free Discourses upon her Conduct and had determined her to act in the manner she had done by the Marquis she added that if her Brother truly loved her he would not be discouraged by a Reserve which was but in Appearance cruel and which in her Situation was absolutely necessary that the Marquis could not but be sensible of her Regard for him and that his Perseverance would convince her of the Sincerity and Ardor of his Passion  The Countess was forced to yield to these specious Reasons she repeated to her Brother what Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  had said and consoled him under the Prohibition she had laid upon him by Assurances that it would not be long before she made him happy These two lovely Friends lived from that Time in the most perfect Union Although the Countess and she did not mix with the great World their manner of  Life had not fewer Charms for them Reading Walking and sometimes the Theatre agreeably varied their Amusements and in these they found more true Pleasure than in brilliant and numerous Circles of which they were formed to be very distinguishing Ornaments The Count of  Berci  always made one in their Parties the Tenderness which the Countess his Wife felt for the Chevalier  des Essars  having nothing criminal in it it did not lessen the Affection she had for the Count the Presence of a Husband deservedly beloved always gave her Delight because she had no Cause to blush for her own Conduct with respect to him but this Calm in the Countess's Fortunes did not last long she was destined to prove still greater Miseries than that of hopeless Love  Her Unhappiness was first begun by the irregular Conduct of  Marianne  her favourite Woman who shared all the Secrets of her Heart and who as has been related before introduced the Chevalier  des Essars  into her Apartment at  Beauplan  This Girl was far from imitating the virtuous Examples set her by her Lady she conceived a violent Passion for a young Gentleman named  Verague  who was intimately acquainted with Monsieur  de Berci  the Count's Brother The Countess although not naturally suspicious yet soon discovered this misplaced Love which could not but be productive of Dishonour to her Woman if not timely suppressed but she  saw with Pain that  Marianne  was so far from endeavouring to conquer her Inclinations in Favour of Monsieur  Verague  that she gave full Scope to them and was not even at the Pains to conceal them from her  The Advances this indiscrete Girl made to  Verague  soon attracted his Notice She was young and handsome he pursued his Conquest and a regular Intrigue commenced between them the Countess often surprised them together at very undue Hours She expostulated with her Woman upon the Danger to which she exposed her Virtue by permitting the Addresses of one too much her superior to give her Hopes of being his Wife  Marianne  was so far from profiting by the prudent Remonstrances of her Lady that her Passion seemed to gather Strength from the Obstacles which opposed it She was no longer solicitous to conceal her Commerce with  Verague  from her Lady she threw aside all Caution and admitted him into her Chamber at all Hours without the least Reserve  The Countess was in great Affliction at this scandalous Behaviour she contented herself at first with reproving her for it in her usual gentle manner but she did not dare to exert the Authority of a Mistress that has nothing to apprehend from a Servant's Resentment she had unfortunately confided to  this Girl her Affection for the Chevalier  des Essars  and however irreproachable her Conduct with respect to him might be yet she was apprehensive that if she drove her to Extremity she might prejudice her Brotherinlaw against her whose Suspicions would soon infect her Lord likewise The Countess's Case was not absolutely singular and it ought to warn the gentle Sex to be cautious how they make Confidents of their Domestics and to make those who are unhappy enough to have Intrigues tremble at the Danger to which they expose themselves by accepting of their Assistance  Marianne  insolent upon her being the Depository of her Lady's Secret and fancying herself in full Security soon threw off the Masque entirely Reserve and Constraint suited not with that Taste of Libertinism which she had imbibed and she carried her Immodesty to such Excess that  Verague  was almost every Night brought into her Chamber when her Lady was retired into her Apartment and they seldom parted till the next Morning The Countess lost all Patience at such infamous Behaviour her whole Soul was filled with a just Indignation and left no room for prudential Considerations she became all on a sudden intrepid to the last Degree and was resolved at the Hazard of whatever might happen to turn the vile  Marianne  out of her Family and gave her but three Days to procure another Establishment  But this Girl full of Grief for being dismissed on an Occasion so shameful for her for she did not doubt but her Lady would disclose her Reasons for acting in the manner she did by her and still more afflicted that she should be deprived of the Opportunities she had hitherto enjoyed of seeing her Lover used her utmost Endeavours to prevent her being obliged to leave her Service but finding her Lady firmly resolved to dismiss her she instantly conceived the blackest and most detestable Project that a wicked Woman could be capable of This was to prevent the Effects of the Countess's Indignation and accuse her of Unchastity and Disloyalty to her Lord  When her Imagination had presented her with this diabolical Scheme she endeavoured to strengthen herself in her Resolution to ruin her Lady and to stifle all Remorse And having settled her Plan she threw herself in young  Berci's  Way and earnestly entreated him to give her a few Moments Audience in his own Apartment  Monsieur  de Berci  surprised at her Request but more at the seeming Emotion with which it was made desired her to attend him immediately As soon as they had entered his Chamber  Marianne  burst into  Tears he eagerly asked her the Cause of her Affliction She first answered only by Sighs and a feigned Confusion which stimulated his Curiosity and made him repeatedly urge his Request At length with interrupting Sobs she told him that her Lady had with the utmost Cruelty and Injustice dismissed her from her Service  Monsieur  de Berci  finding this was all replied calmly that his Sisterinlaw would not have acted thus without some Cause that if she would confess her Fault ingenuously he would engage to make her Peace with her Lady  Marianne  smiled scornfully at that Promise and shaking her Head gave him to understand that the Thing was impossible Monsieur  de Berci  a little alarmed and anxious to know more gave her his Word that if she would disclose the Reasons which had induced her Lady to dismiss her he would not only keep her Secret faithfully but use his utmost Endeavours to serve her  The perfidious and wicked  Marianne  having already settled in her Thoughts what she should say began in this Manner  I am extremely concerned Monsieur at the Necessity I am under to unfold a Mystery to you which will equally surprize and grieve you but I am still more afflicted  at the Part I have unwillingly acted in it I conjure you to believe that if I break the Silence I have so long held it is only to prove my Penitence and my Submission and in full Reliance upon the Promise you have given me that the Secret shall never escape you I have been long tortured with the Stings of my own Conscience for the Treachery I have been forced to be guilty of to my Lord by serving his Lady in a criminal Passion which you are not wholly unacquainted with yourself but it is Time that I should restore Peace and Tranquility to my Mind so long distracted with Remorse and which my Lady by her imprudent Rage against me has made it necessary I should discover to clear my own Innocence  Know then Monsieur pursued this Monster that the same Day which made my Lady acquainted with the Passion of the Chevalier  des Essars  for her whose Complaints in the Forest of  Beauplan  you heard as well as she gave Rise to a flame in her heart for him the Alarm some Nights afterwards in the Castle supposed to be occasioned by an attempt of some Thieves to ro  it was wholly owing to my Lady's Imprudence in admitting the Chevalier privately into her Apartment unhappy that I am in the Recollection it was I who introduced him but I durst not withstand her peremptory Orders I did all that a Servant  could do in such a Case I represented to her respectfully the Dangers to which she exposed herself and she had soon Reason to be convinced that I had not exaggerated them The Count your Brother coming unexpectedly into my Lady's Chamber the Chevalier was obliged to conceal himself behind the Tapistry and it was wonderful that he was not seen for he had scarce a Moment to effect his Escape but a still greater danger followed for when he left my Lady she ordered me to conduct him down Stairs without any other Light than that of the Moon which shone in through the Windows lest a Taper might alarm some of the Servants the Chevalier as he descended the Stairs made a false Step he fell down and his Pistol went off the Report of which put the whole House into Confusion and Dismay From that Time the Countess and the Chevalier have carried on a strict Correspondence You may now Monsieur added she account for that violent Grief my Lady discovered some Time ago when the Sight of her Lover pale bloody and in Appearance dead took from her the Power of dissembling You may now know the Cause of that Melancholy in which she is continually plunged since the Chevalier's Duel with the Count of  Polan  which has forced him to absent himself from her and you know likewise the Cause of my Dismission from her service I am become  a troublesome and importunate Inmate whose Presence she can no longer support because taking Advantage of the Chevalier's Absence I endeavour to bring her back to her Duty and because I am tortured with Remorse for the Part I have had in her Infidelity to my Lord  The Wretch ended her Speech with another Shower of Tears and with dreadful Inprecations on herself if what she had related was not strictly true  Monsieur  de Berci  although he had a high Opinion of his Sisterinlaw's Virtue yet could not help being staggered at this Relation he knew for a Certainty that the Chevalier  des Essars  was in Love with her his own Ears had heard him declare it in the Forest of  Beauplan  and more than once his Eyes in observing those of the Chevalier and Madame  de Berci  discovered that his Sisterinlaw was not insensible yet he could not imagine her capable of a Crime so horrid as to dishonour his Brother in the Manner the vile  Marianne  accused her of after giving a few Moments to his reflexions on what he had heard he took a resolution full of Prudence and Generosity As he would not condemn his Sisterinlaw upon the Reports of her Servant so neither could he hold her absolutely innocent in his own Opinion since there were some Circumstances in her Conduct that bore a doubtful Appearance  He thought it just to wait till he had more Certainty of her Guilt before he made her Infamy publick and supposing that if the Lovers were realy guilty it would not be impossible for him by the Assistance of  Marianne  to surprize them together as soon as the Chevalier was again permitted to return to  Paris  he determined to engage this Girl in his Interest But if it happened that the Chevalier should be unable to procure his Pardon and remain in perpetual Banishment he judged it best to bury all he had heard in Oblivion since the honour of his Brother would be preserved by the Chevalier's Absence and having then nothing to fear from his Sisterinlaw's indiscreet Passion there would be no Necessity to wound the Peace of the Count and introduce Disorder and Infamy into his Family  He therefore strictly charged  Marianne  not to impart to any other Person in the World what she had said to him he promised to restore her to her Lady's Favour upon Condition that she would give him a faithful Account of her whole Conduct particularly in every Thing that related to the Chevalier  des Essars Marianne  joyfully swore to obey him and he instantly went to the Apartment of the Countess to perform his promise he praised the affection and fidelity of that wicked Girl he exaggerated her Grief for being obliged to quit her Service and begged the Countess to take compassion  on her and if her fault was not very great to admit her to her usual attendance upon her Person  Madam  de Berci  was softened at this Account of her Woman's Contrition She was not sorry that she had a lawful Excuse for taking her again for she had been under dreadful Apprehensions of her Malice she sent for her into her Apartment and before her Brother told her that through his Interposition she had consented to receive her again but as soon as Monsieur  de Berci  withdrew she told her with a very severe Air that she expected to see a thorough Reformation in her Conduct and that it was upon that Condition alone she restored her to her former Place The dissembling  Marianne  with tears in her eyes thanked her Lady for her Goodness and promised Amendment but in her Heart she deeply vowed to make her pay dear for the Mortifications she had suffered  The Countess of  Berci  was scarce relieved from the Anxiety this Affair had given her when she was assaulted by new Disquiets The Count her Husband had a Kinsman who having formerly given some Disgust to the Court had been banished from  France  after he had spent some Years in travelling over all  Europe  he resolved to settle in  Venice  for the Remainder of his Life This City which is one of the most celebrated in all  Italy  had peculiar Charms for him on Account  of the Freedom that reigned there His Quality and Merit soon procured him the Respect and Esteem of the Nobility of that powerful Republic who tho' naturally haughty and not easy of access to Foreigners yet were solicitous to make his Residence amongst them pleasing to him He lived there thirty Years and dying suddenly in a very advanced Age the Count of  Berci  who was his nearest Relation succeeded to all his vast Riches and as soon as he was informed of his Death prepared for a Journey to  Venice  to take Possession of them  The young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  having a Desire to visit  Italy  again where he had formerly spent some Months with his Friend Monsieur  de Morigny  intreated the Count's Leave to accompany him in this Voyage Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  had not yet taken off her Interdiction and he was willing to try if a greater Distance from what he loved would not weaken his continual Regret at being deprived of her Presence Besides he was not without Hope that an Absence which no longer depended upon her Will to revoke would give his capricious Mistress herself some little Anxiety  The Count readily agreed to the Marquis's Proposal and thanked him for offering so frankly what he would have solicited had he not thought it too great a Favour They set out immediately for their Voyage to  Venice  where they arrived happily the Beginning of Spring They staid there a Month during which Time the Count settled all his Affairs and having a fine Season before them they determined to visit  Rome  and some other of the celebrated Cities in  Italy  In their Return they passed by  Leghorn  where they found a Felucca which was only waiting for a favourable Wind to set Sail for  Marseilles  The Count and the Marquis eager to see again the dear Objects of their Affection resolved to embark in this Felucca as being the most expeditious Way of returning besides the great Heat of the Weather made travelling by Land very disagreeable but they had no sooner reached the Coast of  Genoa  when they had Reason to repent of their Design they were encountered by a Corsair of  Algiers  whom they found it impossible to escape from  The two  French  Lords although as brave as Men could be yet plainly saw that any Resistance they could make would not preserve their Liberty but would inevitably expose them to Death and perhaps to the most cruel Tortures the  Algerine  was manned with a great Number of valiant and desperate  Turks  who presented themselves to the Attack while they had very few Sailors and only some Passengers aboard who were destitute of all manner of Defence with such Inequality it would have been Madness to fight it was resolved therefore that they  should use their utmost Endeavours to escape and if they proved unsuccessful to surrender peaceably that they might not to no Purpose irritate those who were likely to be their Masters  The  Turks  however having grappled their small Vessel boarded it with their Cymetars in their Hands they stript the Passengers and the Crew to their Shirts and tying them all to the Oar set Sail for  Africa  As they were pursuing their Voyage full of an insolent and barbarous Joy for the Prize they had taken their Vessel was driven by a Storm into the Gulf of  Barcelona  where it was attacked by a  Maltese  Galley commanded by a  Spanish  Knight of the Order The miserable Captives on board the  Algerine  beholding this unhopedfor Assistance offered up the most ardent Prayers to Heaven for the Success of their Friends Their Joy and their Hopes were but shortlived the Wind which at first was favourable for the  Maltese  Galley changed suddenly as it was attempting to grapple that of  Algiers  and the Corsair doubting his Strength endeavoured to escape by the Force of rowing which he effected  What a dreadful Reverse of Fortune was this for the two  French  Lords and the rest of the unhappy Captives But the Surprise the Grief which seized one of those brave Knights in the  Maltese  Galley when he beheld the two noble Slaves are not to be described  The Chevalier  de Morigny  for it was he himself could scarce believe the Evidence of his own Eyes when they distinguished the Count of  Berci  and the Marquis  de Saint Sauveur  chained like a great Number of other Wretches to the Oar But these illustrious Captives stretching out their Arms loaden with Fetters and calling him by his Name convinced him he was not mistaken They had not Time to conjure him to save them from the Cruelties of their Enemies for at that Instant the Wind seconding the Efforts of the Rowers to escape the  Algerine  Vessel was at once carried away from his Eyes and his Vengeance  Monsieur  de Morigny  was inconsolable at this sad Sight Notwithstanding all his Virtue and his Resignation to Providence he suffered with some Kind of Impatience and Repining the Effects of an Event so favourable to those Barbarians which deprived him of an Opportunity of succouring two Friends whom he loved with the tenderest Affection The more he reflected on this strange Adventure the less he was able to comprehend how the Count of  Berci  and his Brotherinlaw should happen to be on Seas so distant from their native Country and chained to an Oar in an  Algerine  Vessel The more he reflected upon this amazing Accident the more his Mind was perplexed The only Thing that now remained for him to do was to send Notice to  France  of the Captivity of his noble  Friends he wrote to the Countess of  Berci  and gave her an affecting Relation of the sad Spectacle his Eyes had seen and wept her noble Husband and her Brother mingled with Slaves and labouring at an Oar he assured her that he would himself have made a Voyage to  Africa  to procure their Deliverance but that his Duty obliged him to cruize the Remainder of the Summer upon the Seas he recommended it to her to send instantly some Person whose Prudence and Fidelity she could rely upon to  Africa  to treat with the Infidels for the Ransom of her Lord and her Brother  The Countess was seized with Horror and Dismay at the Contents of this Letter she fell fainting into the Arms of her Woman upon reading the first Lines which acquainted her with the miserable Condition of two Persons so dear to her and when she recovered it was only to a painful Sense of agonising Sorrow but her Grief violent as it was did not prevent her from contriving instant Means for their Rescue Her Lord's Brother was the Person on whom she cast her Eyes to manage their Redemption Monsieur  de Berci  met her Request with a Zeal that shewed the Greatness of his Affection for his Brother no Dangers could hinder him from undertaking the Voyage to serve him he pressed for a speedy Departure and the Countess without waiting for an Application to her Father gave her Brotherinlaw  all the ready Money she had and her richest Jewels to make up the Sum for the Ransom of her Husband and her Brother Monsieur  de Berci  being thus furnished with every thing that was necessary took Leave of the afflicted Countess and set out for  Marseilles  in order to embark there for  Africa  The Captivity of these two illustrious  Frenchmen  made a great Noise at the Court of  France  A Friend of the Chevalier  des Essars  to whom he had confided the Place of his Retreat sent him this News into  Anjou  almost as soon as it was known at Court The Chevalier after giving some Tears to the Misfortunes of his Friends felt a secret Satisfaction in his Mind at the Thoughts of being able to give the Countess of  Berci  a new Instance of the Purity and Disinterestedness of his Passion he determined to make a Voyage instantly to  Africa  and to expose his Life his Fortunes and perhaps his Liberty to free the Count of  Berci  and the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  from the Slavery they groaned under  A Lover of equal Delicacy can only feel the Force of this Action and nothing less than a Hero can be capable of approving a Design which so many almost invincible Obstacles seemed to oppose but true Love thinks every thing easy to be done when the Interest of the beloved Object is in Question  The Chevalier  des Essars  listened to nothing but the Dictates of his Passion and his Courage already he tasted the transporting Delight of doing his Mistress a considerable Service and of giving her a new Proof of his Tenderness He set out immediately for  Paris  in a Disguise and securely reached the House of an intimate Friend where he staid a few Days to provide himself with Money necessary for his Voyage and the Redemption of the two noble Captives As soon as every thing was prepared for his Departure he wrote a Letter to the Countess informing her of the Occasion of his Arrival at  Paris  and the Resolution he had taken to set out immediately for  Marseilles  he intreated his Friend not to send this Letter to the Countess till two Hours after his Departure from  Paris  He thought it necessary to use this Precaution lest she should imagine that he wanted to pay his purposed Service by the Pleasure of seeing her or to draw from her some Marks of Acknowledgment and full of the pleasing Hope of soon restoring to her two Persons who were so deservedly dear to her he left  Paris  and took the Road to  Provence  attended by the same Gentleman whom he had taken with him to  Anjou  The Countess of  Berci  although she had been accustomed to receive very extraordinary Proofs of Love from the Chevalier yet was extremely surprised at this last she admired the Generosity and unbounded Courage  of this faithful Lover who seemed born to render her new Services Her Gratitude so strongly engaged her Heart for the first time that it delivered itself up to a Tenderness she had hitherto suppressed A Service of such Importance to be so eagerly undertaken without being requested to make a Voyage to a barbarous Region from whence he might possibly never return with a Courage so heroic such perfect Disinterestedness to expect no other Reward than what he found in the Pleasure of serving her and the great Delicacy he had shewn in renouncing even the Satisfaction of seeing her before his Departure in a Word such striking Instances of the most pure and constant Passion that ever Man was capable of excited during some Moments Sentiments more soft than Friendship and Acknowledgments more tender than Gratitude a while she indulged the sweetly painful Emotions but her Duty and her Honour those lawful Tyrants of her Soul soon united their Forces to deliver her from the Assaults of Love  Oh Prudence too rigid Oh Virtue too severe cried she bursting into Tears suffer me to have some Respite you have nothing till this Day to reproach me with I will inviolably observe your Dictates to the last Moment of my Life But alas how cruel is my Destiny what Torments must a tender and grateful Heart experience  who can no other ways requite such Benefits but by new Severities  The Countess was resigning herself to these melancholly Reflexions when Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  came into her Chamber their Friendship and Intimacy had long ago banished all Reserve and entering without sending Notice of her Arrival she found Madam  de Berci  bathed in Tears and so lost in Grief that she did not perceive her Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  ran to her afflicted Friend and with a tender Anxiety begged to know if any new Misfortune had happened to her the Countess raising her Head and looking on her with Eyes which tho' swimming in Tears expressed a kind Compassion for her who was but too much concerned in the News she had to tell her At the Mention of her Lover's Captivity Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  threw herself upon a Sopha with a Sigh that seemed to rend her Heart in Pieces a deadly Paleness overspread her face she lifted up her fine Eyes in speechless Agony to Heaven a while she abandoned herself to the Bitterness of her Reflexions then turning to the Countess who was sat weeping by her  Ah Madam said she it is for me to weep who by the foolish extravagance of my Conduct have lost perhaps for ever the most faithful Lover in the World you have only Fortune to complain of I have Fortune and Myself if your Lord groans  in Fetters you have the Consolation of knowing that you are not the Author of his Miseries but it is my Injustice that has thrown my Lover into a horrid Dungeon my Cruelty has reduced him to Slavery but for my Caprice and Folly this dear Brother had now been with you comforting you under your Misfortunes and endeavouring to redress them without feeling any other himself but what arose from his sympathising Tenderness Alas my dear Countess added she embracing her tenderly ought I to hope that you will pardon my Injustice to your Brother and then my dear and injured Lover pursued she bursting again into Tears canst thou forget my injurious Treatment of thee ah if Fate ever restores thee to me will my Tenderness and Fidelity repay thee for all the Torments thou hast suffered through me  The Countess of  Berci  was greatly moved at the Affliction of Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  her Heart softened by her own Woes made her more sensible of those of another These tender and afflicted Friends past all their Time together the compassion they mutually afforded each other soothed their Griefs but the Countess had some which she was obliged to smother in her own breast Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  was far less to be pitied she might without Guilt or Restraint resign herself up to the Tenderness of  a lawful Passion and had no Vows to make but for the Deliverance of her Lover but the Countess besides her Grief for the Captivity of a Husband and a Brother whom she loved trembled for the Life of a Hero who was dear to her yet whom her Duty forbid her to love  The Ladies in their calmer Moments often talked of the Generosity of the Chevalier  des Essars  and when their Minds were not weakened by dreadful Apprehensions concerning the Destiny of Friends so deservedly dear to them they hoped for every Thing favourable from his Zeal his Courage and his good Fortune  Mean Time Monsieur  de Berci  arrived at  Marseilles  and embarked immediately in a Vessel that was ready to sail for  Africa  but they suffered a great deal by Storms and wandered for more than a Month upon the  Spanish  Coasts The Chevalier  des Essars  was more fortunate he found at  Marseilles  two Religious of the Order for the Redemption of Captives who were waiting only for a favourable Wind to set sail for  Oran  a fortified Town situated in the Kingdom of  Algiers  they were to land first at this Capital and afterwards to proceed to  Tunis  to free a great Number of Slaves according to the Engagements of their pious Institution The Chevalier was rejoiced at an opportunity of joining Persons who by  the frequent Voyages they had made with a Zeal so holy into those barbarous Countries were received and treated with Respect by the Infidels themselves he flattered himself that with the assistance of their charitable Diligence they would easily discover the Place where his two Friends were confined and might more successfully treat for their Ransom  He was not deceived in these agreeable Expectations the two Religious promised him their utmost Assistance and the Wind becoming fair they embarked and set sail for  Africa  They had a favourable Voyage and after some slight Storms that were followed by no dangerous Accidents they landed safe at  Oran  where they proposed to rest a few Days before they executed their Commission but the Chevalier  des Essars  whose Impatience to see his Friends at Liberty would not suffer him to consult his own Health set out instantly for  Algiers  travelling the Rest of the Way by Land As he spoke the  Spanish  Tongue perfectly well he easily past for a Merchant of that Nation who traded in Jewels He avoided with great Care every thing that might give the Infidels the least Suspicion of his Quality or the Occasion of his Voyage But let us now return to those illustrious Victims of their Barbarity  When the Count of  Berci  and the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  saw that the  Maltese  Galley was prevented by the Wind which became directly contrary to them from getting up to the Corsair and that there was no Probability of their being delivered from their Slavery they abandoned themselves to the most frightful Despair Their Grief was encreased even by the sight of Monsieur  de Morigny  that Friend so dear to them both upon whose Valour they depended more than upon that of all the other brave Knights that accompanied him This cruel event filled them with the most melancholy Reflections all the Horrors of that destiny which waited for them at  Algiers  rose to their Imaginations their Minds being weakened by the terrible apprehensions they laboured under they soon became incapable of performing the laborious exercise to which they were destined and this incapacity drew upon them an encrease of Severity from their cruel Masters At length they resigned themselves with submission to the decrees of that Providence which orders all human Events they relied with a pious Confidence upon it and indulged a hope that the Chevalier  Morigny  would not forget them in their Misfortunes This last Thought gave them great Consolation and flattering themselves that the Corsair would not separate them in their Prison they determined to wait with patience for the happy Moment of their Deliverance  But this Barbarian had no Intention to grant them such a Favour the noble Air and the rich Dress they were in when he took them made him conclude that they were Men of high Quality he determined therefore not to sell them but to make their Slavery so insupportable by his hash Treatment as to make them glad to purchase their Liberty at any Price he should demand for it  As soon as they landed at  Algiers  he ordered them to be thrown into separate Dungeons where they had not the least Glimmering of Light he would not allow them to take Leave of each other they begged only for a parting Embrace and the Request was punished with Stripes which they suffered with such a noble Patience and such Dignity of silent Grief as would have moved any other Heart but that of a Corsair accustomed to treat Christians with the most savage Cruelty  On the fourth Day of their miserable Confinement the Doors of their Dungeons were opened but it was only to expose the Count of  Berci  to a Treatment still more humbling and rigorous than what he had yet endured As he was of a Constitution more strong and robust than the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  the inhuman Corsair destined him to labour in his Lands in the Country he caused him to be conducted thither with five other Slaves tied two and two together like the vilest Animals  He placed a Wretch as cruel as himself over them who gave them no Intermission from their Labour and who punished every Symptom of Weariness with Stripes and abusive Language They were allowed no other Nourishment than Bread and Water and at Night when their Labour was ended they were thrown covered with Sweat and Dust into a dark damp Dungeon where a little Straw was all that composed their Bed  What a dreadful Situation for a Man of the first Quality brought up in Luxury and surrounded with pleasures The Marquis  de Saint Sauveur  was treated with less Barbarity but he owed his indulgence to the Avarice of the  Corsair  the great delicacy of his Make made the Wretch apprehensive that he should lose him if he put him to Labours beyond his Strength He was therefore employed in his Gardens but his Grief at being separated from the Count joined to his other disquiets of which Love was the most poignant made his misfortunes not less unsupportable  The Count of  Berci  could not long support the Weight of so many miseries he sunk under them at length and fell dangerously ill His Master beginning to fear that he should lose him ordered proper Nourishment to be given him and allowed him some intermission from his labour but as soon as he had recovered Strength  he was again obliged to resume his first Employment  The Chevalier  des Essars  had been four Days in  Algiers  without being able to do any thing for his Friends the Pirate had been absent three Weeks but at his Return the Chevalier immediately sent the two Religious to him who had been the Companions of his Voyage they offered him a very considerable Sum for the Ransom of several Captives among whom they comprehended the two French Lords they discovered no particular Solicitude concerning them lest the Terms of their Redemption should be made more difficult this Artifice did not succeed The  Corsair  made a great Difference between them and his other Slaves and demanded such an extravagant Sum for their Freedom that the two Religious thought proper to speak to him no more on the Subject for some Days that they might not confirm him in the notion he had conceived of their Quality  The Chevalier whose Impatience to see his Friends at Liberty could not bear any Delay thought every Moment an Age till he had purchased their release and ordered the two  Friars  to give the Pirate whatever he demanded but they prudently represented to him that if they proceeded in that manner with the avaricious  Corsair  he would insist upon still harder Conditions and would advance  his Price in Proportion as he saw them eager for their Deliverance The Chevalier was at length prevailed upon to trust their Experience and Zeal with the Conclusion of a Bargain which he desired so ardently Accordingly these holy Men went three Days afterwards to the Pirate's House and without taking any Notice of the two noble Slaves offered to ransom twelve others for which they immediately agreed upon the Price The Pirate seeing them preparing to go without mentioning the Prisoners he had taken in his last Prize was the first to propose a Sum for their Ransom the Religious affecting great Indifference agreed at last to give ten thousand Livres which the Corsair accepted and they promised him to bring the Money the next Morning  That Moment so earnestly desired by the Chevalier at last came the Religious paid the Sum agreed on and flew to open those dreadful Prisons the eternal Abode of Horror and of Grief After telling the unhappy Sufferers with proper Caution that they were now at Liberty their Fetters were struck off and they were led into the open Air The unexpected News of his Freedom had such an Effect upon the Count of  Berci  whose Mind and Body were greatly weakened that he fainted away in the Arms of the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  who had been first taken out of his miserable Confinement and had eagerly advanced to embrace him The Religious  finding all Endeavours to recover the Count from his Swoon ineffectual they carried him in that Condition to the Lodgings of the Chevalier  des Essars  That faithful Friend was expecting them with an anxious Impatience he ran to strain them in his Arms and welcome them to Freedom and Happiness when seeing the Count brought in motionless he stopt short Grief and Amazement usurped the Place of Joy he thought he was dead for a livid Paleness overspread his Face and he was so emaciated that he was hardly to be known He was beginning to give Vent to his Grief and his Complaints for this new Misfortune when the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  who know not of the Chevalier's Arrival at  Algiers  threw himself suddenly into his Arms with Exclamations of Surprise and Joy For some Moments they held each other in a strict Embrace without the Power of expressing their Sentiments any otherwise than by Tears their Solicitude for their Friend at length drew them out of this Rapture they both sprung in one Instant to him and by proper Applications he was at length brought out of his Swoon he opened his Eyes but it was only to turn them wildly about on the Objects around him in a few Moments his Speech and Understanding returned and the Marquis and the Chevalier meeting his Eyes  his Surprise at this View had like to have brought on a Relapse  Allpowerful Heaven cried he with a Voice seeble and languishing but expressive of the Emotions his Heart laboured with what do I see Is it a Dream or am I really awake What Wonders have I beheld this Day Oh gracious and all wise Providence I adore thy infinite Goodness in bringing to me again these Friends so dear to my Soul Finish Oh finish thy Work almighty Power pursued he with Eyes and Hands raised towards Heaven and restore me likewise to the Sight of her without whom I cannot live  Then holding out his Hand to the Chevalier  des Essars  who stood regarding his Action with Eyes swimming in Tears of Tenderness and Joy  Dear and faithful Friend pursued he cease to load us thus with Benefits or teach us how to acknowledge them in a manner worthy of thee but is it possible to make suitable Returns to this last Proof of your generous Friendship Oh Brother added he turning to the Marquis our Lives have long since been his Gift under God can either of us refuse to sacrifice them for his Service  The Chevalier unable to bear these Transports of his Gratitude ran into his  Arms and embracing him tenderly congratulated him on his Liberty He then quitted him to the Marquis who claimed a Share in the Endearments of the beloved Husband of his Sister  When these mutual Raptures were a little subsided they gave each other an Account of what had happened to them during their Separation The Chevalier was greatly affected at the Recital of what his Friends had suffered the Count in particular whom the Corsairs had treated so cruelly that not even the Joy of his recovered Liberty nor the tender Cares of his Friends could hinder him from feeling the Effects of it He was seized with a violent Fever which held him fourteen Days during the whole Time that his Recovery was doubtful the Chevalier and the Marquis were in the utmost Affliction but the natural Strength of his Constitution at length overcame the Disease and his Health restored Tranquility and Joy to his sympathising Friends who now thought of nothing but hastening their Departure  Mean time young  Berci  who had been tossed about by contrary Winds and in great Danger from several Storms arrived at length safe at  Algiers  the Chevalier  des Essars  and the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  were walking upon the Port of that City whither they were drawn by the Beauty of the  Place and the Necessity they had for some fresh Air when the Vessel that brought Monsieur  de Berci  entered the Harbour with full Sails the Chevalier and the Marquis were upon the Point of returning Home to the Count who on account of some Remainder of Weakness could not accompany them in their Walk when their Curiosity to see the Passengers who were preparing to land detained them a few Moments longer but their Surprize was extreme to see the Count's Brother among them they ran eagerly to embrace him nor was he less astonished at the Sight of the Marquis and the Chevalier one of whom he believed in Fetters and the other in the Heart of  Anjou  He immediately concluded that the Chevalier had prevented him in his Design nor could he guard his Mind from a little Emotion of Jealousy he regretted that his Brother and the Marquis should owe their Deliverance from Slavery to any other than himself after the Fatigue and Dangers he had endured to have the Satisfaction of doing them that Service But these Thoughts soon gave way to his Anxiety for his Brother he enquired with a tender Impatience for him they soon released him from his Apprehensions at not seeing him with them and carried him immediately to their Lodgings  The Count of  Berci  was not less astonished than they had been at the Sight of  his Brother he embraced him tenderly and expressed the highest Acknowledgment for this Proof of his Affection with a trembling Eagerness he enquired after the Health of his Wife and when Monsieur  de Berci  shewed him her Jewels which she had given him to purchase his Freedom he burst into Tears of Joy Gratitude and Love His Impatience to see again that dear Object of his fondest Wishes gave him new Strength and he declared that he was able to embark immediately for  France  His Friends however impatient themselves to return to their native Country which was still more endeared to them by the Remembrance of those beloved Persons they had left in it insisted upon the Count's staying till his Health was perfectly reestablished The Count of  Berci  had a Motive more strong for his Delay he could not think of leaving his Servants that had been taken with him in the Felucca Victims to the Cruelty of the  Algerines  he judged of their Sufferings by his own and his Compassion for them being heightened by that painful Remembrance he was resolved not to leave  Algiers  till he had effected their Deliverance It was not without great Difficulty that they were found they had been all sold by the Corsairs and had more than once changed their Masters during the Continuance of their Slavery  The Count of  Berci  thought himself under an indispensible Obligation to ransom them those unhappy Men had been so barbarously treated that they were the more sensible of the generous Kindness of their Lord in giving them Freedom  Nothing now opposed their speedy Departure the Count and the Marquis expressed their Gratitude to the two Religious who had treated so prudently for their Ransom by making them several noble Presents but they did not stop there they left very considerable Sums in their Hands to open the Dungeons of a great Number of Christians who had long suffered all the Rigors of Slavery They thought they could not better express their Gratitude to their Maker for their own Deliverance than by freeing their FellowCreatures and their Brethren in the same Communion out of the Hands of Infidels who blasphemed his holy Name by this pious Use of Part of their great Riches they hoped to draw a Blessing upon the Remainder and this Act of Charity performed they all embarked on board a Vessel that was preparing to sail for  Provence  and le  t for ever that barbarous Region where they had suffered such cruel Torments At length that God whom they had invoked in their Affliction and whom they had rendered propitious by their Alms who commands the Winds and the Waves who bids Tempests be still and  smooths the Face of the Deep that God protected them throughout their Voyage and gave them to land safely at  Marseilles  three Months and some odd Days after the Departure of the Chevalier  des Essars  for  Africa  The END of the Second PART  THE HISTORY OF THE Chevalier DES ESSARS AND THE Countess OF BERCI PART III  THE Count of  Berci  and his noble Friends as soon as they landed at  Marseilles  offered up a solemn Thanksgiving to God for the Mercies they had received They stayed some Days there not so much to take a View of all the Beauties of that celebrated City which for its Strength its Extent and the Security of its Commerce was in such high Esteem and drew to it continually Merchants from every Nation in the Universe but to rest themselves after the Fatigues of a long Voyage Their Impatience to see the Countess of  Berci  and Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  prompted the Count and the Marquis to a speedy Departure The Chevalier though he was not at Liberty to own his Motive was no less eager to get to  Paris  Accordingly they pursued their Journey with all possible Haste and reached that great Capital towards Aut    They alighted all together at the Count of  Berci's  Hotel he would not suffer the Chevalier to seek any other Asylum than one which he by his friendly Solicitude could render most secure to him He told him that he would not part with him till the King had signed his Pardon which he hoped he would not refuse to his Solicitations and that of his Friends all of whom would interest themselves in his Behalf The Chevalier expressed the highest Gratitude to the Count for his friendly Offers which too agreably flattered his secret Wishes not to be accepted with Joy  It is not easy to give an Idea of that Mixture of Surprise Joy Tenderness and grateful Rapture which filled the Souls of the Countess of  Berci  and Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  at the Sight of Persons so dear to them The Marquis  de SaintSauveur  threw himself at the Feet of his charming Mistress whose Eyes welcomed him with streaming Tenderness while the Count ran into the Arms of his Wife and in the most endearing Language expressed his Joy at seeing her again  It was with Difficulty he tore himself from her soft Embrace to present the Chevalier  des Essars  to her  See Madam said he to her that tender and generous Friend who makes it the Business of his Life to serve us who not satisfied with having more than once delivered us from impending Death has now freed us from the Horrors of a Slavery far more to be dreaded  The Countess advanced immediately to salute him pleased that her Duty and her Inclinations this once coincided she gave free Vent to the grateful Sentiments that filled her Soul she praised his generous Friendship she acknowledged the great Obligations she owed him and assured him she should ever preserve the most grateful Remembrance of them  I have done nothing Madam said the Chevalier interrupting the Countess than what any other in the same Circumstances and with the same Incitements would have done but were the Services I have been so happy to render your Lord and your Brother far more considerable they would be overpaid by the Sensibility you are pleased to express for them and am I not doubly rewarded pursued he smiling and directing the Eyes of the Count and Countess to the young Marquis who was pouring out his Soul in grateful Transports at the Feet of his Mistress by the Pleasure I feel myself  at restoring a faithful Lover to the Object of his Wishes  The Marquis and Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  finding they were observed joined the rest of the Company and the Conversation became more general that lovely Girl thought it would be no Violation of the Laws of Modesty and Decorum to join her Thanks for the Delivery of the noble Captives to those of the Countess of  Berci  she could no longer disguise her real Sentiments her Joy to see again the Marquis after a cruel Captivity which had appeared so tedious to her broke out in every Look and Action the happy Lover on his Side assured her that his Absence from her was a Torment far greater than all the Hardships he had suffered from his barbarous Masters in  Africa  A calm and settled Joy succeeded their first Transports at this happy Meeting and in the present Satisfaction all Remembrance of past Evils was forgot  Some Days afterwards the Count of  Berci  and the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  went to the  Louvre  to pay their Duty to his Majesty and both resolved to use their utmost Endeavours to obtain a Pardon for the Chevalier  des Essars  That Prince who had been informed of their Captivity had the Goodness to assure them of his Concern for the Miseries they had suffered in  Algiers  he commanded the Count to give him a particular  Relation of their Slavery and the Treatment which they had received from the Infidels the Count obeyed and the great Heart of  Henry  was sensibly affected with the melancholy Detail The Count of  Berci  seeing his Majesty so much moved thought this a favourable Moment for the Chevalier and continuing his Relation he informed the King in what manner they were delivered from their Chains and how greatly they had been obliged to the Chevalier  des Essars  who had generously undertaken a Voyage to  Africa  for their Service and by his wise and prudent Conduct obtained their Liberty Observing the King struck with such a noble Instance of Friendship and Generosity the Count of  Berci  entered into a Justification of his Friend's Conduct with respect to his last Combat with the Count of  Polan  he explained to his Majesty the Necessity the Chevalier was under to take Notice of the Injury he received which was publicly charged to the Count of  Polan  he produced the Count's Answer to the Challenge sent him by the Chevalier as a Proof of what he advanced Then the Marquis and he throwing themselves at the King's Feet besought him to pardon the Chevalier  des Essars  in Consideration of his great Valour his inviolable Fidelity to his Sovereign his aimable Character and the Wrong he had suffered by which he was provoked to take Revenge  The King was a little shook by their Intreaties and the Arguments urged in Favour of the Chevalier but when he reflected that a Man whom all the Kingdom knew to be particularly dear to him was killed by the Chevalier in Defiance of his Edicts and at the Hazard of mortally offending him all the Solicitations of the Count and the Marquis could not prevail with him to pardon their Friend they returned Home full of Grief for their bad Success and this Cloud that hung over the Chevalier's Fortune embittered their Joys for their happy Return to  France  The Countess of  Berci  and Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  were greatly afflicted at this Rigor of his Majesty as they thought unjustly exerted in the Case of the Chevalier but although their Affliction arose from Motives very different in each yet it was pretty near equal for in a generous Heart Gratitude produces Sentiments as tender as those of Love Mean time the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  pursued his good Fortune with Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  his Sufferings on her account had augmented her Tenderness She had made too full a Discovery of her Sentiments to the Countess and even to her Lover himself to indulge any farther female Parade without incurring the Censure of Affectation and Caprice The Marquis with a Lover's Ardor pressed for an early Day Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  but faintly denied  As she was entirely Mistress of herself and Fortune she could form no Excuse for a longer Delay she therefore yielded to give the Marquis her Hand as soon as the necessary Preparations for their Marriage were made The Countess was charmed with her ready Compliance and Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  obligingly assured her that the Happiness she proposed to herself in acquiring such a Sister was not one of her least Motives for so sudden a Consent though she allowed to her Brother's faithful Passion and her own Inclinations in his Favour their full Force  Letters were immediately dispatched to  Burgundy  to the old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and his Lady acquainting them with Mademoiselle  de Montmartin's  Consent to give her Hand to their Son which was an Event they had both earnestly wished for In the expected Happiness of such a Union they buried all Remembrance of their past Sorrows for the Captivity of their only Son and although weakened with Age and Infirmities they resolved to take a Journey to  Paris  and honour with their Presence the Solemnity of his Nuptials  The old Nobleman and his Lady were infinitely delighted to find the Chevalier  des Essars  at their Soninlaw's Hotel The Count of  Berci  presented him to them with his usual Tenderness the old Marquis embraced him  with Transport calling him the Preserver of himself and his Family the Marchioness received his Compliments with the Tenderness of a Mother to a worthy Son The Chevalier politely begged that he might be allowed to offer them his Hotel for their Residence during their Stay in  Paris  Since added he smiling the Count of  Berci's  Hospitality has obliged me to become an Inmate here  The old Marquis and his Lady gratefully accepted his Offer they were conducted thither in the Evening by their Son and the Count and Countess of  Berci  and the next Morning Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  went to pay her Respects to them  The old Marquis and his Lady were charmed with the Beauty good Sense and Politeness of their designed Daughterinlaw they applauded their Son for his Choice and not the less for having consulted as they supposed Fortune as well as external Qualities in that Choice The young Marquis suffered his Parents to attribute as much Prudence to him as they pleased though his Heart told him that Mademoiselle  de Montmartin's  Fortune great as it was was nevertheless one of his least Inducements for making his Addresses to her  The Nuptials of the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and Mademoiselle  de Montmartin  were celebrated with a Magnificence suitable to their Quality and Riches but alas  how was the Pomp of that Day's Ceremony darkened What bitter Grief succeeded to their Joys That Day was at once to the new married Couple and their Friends the happiest and most miserable of their Lives  The Ceremony of the Marriage performed the Bride and Bridegroom with their Relations and Friends went to the Hotel of the Chevalier  des Essars  where Monsieur and Madam  de SaintSauveur  had caused a splendid Entertainment to be prepared At One o'Clock in the Morning the new married Pair retired the rest of the Company continued dancing but the Count and Countess of  Berci  after they had attended the Bride and Bridegroom to their Apartment returned Home without taking Leave of the Company that they might not oblige them to break up  The Chevalier  des Essars  on account of the Disgrace he was in with the King was not able to assist at this Day's Ceremony he went early to Bed but an unusual Inquietude for which he could assign no Cause hindered him from Sleeping he rose and walked about his Chamber and when he thought he had fatigued himself with that Exercise he went again to Bed but Sleep still sled his Eyes his Imagination was tortured with sad and dismal Images that would not leave him a Moment's Repose he started at every little Noise without knowing why his Heart beat  in an unusual measure and he was preparing again to rise when he heard the Count's Coach at the Gate  The Arrival of the Count and Countess seemed to suspend his Uneasiness he heard them pass by his Antichamber and he again endeavoured to take some Rest Monsieur and Madam  de Berci  after enquiring of the Chevalier's Health retired to their own Chamber  Marianne  whose Conduct had been strictly observed by her Lady ever since the Discovery she had made of her Amour took Advantage of that Day's Solemnity which she concluded would keep the Count and Countess very late from Home to admit her Lover once more into her Chamber she could not imagine they would return so soon as they did but hearing the Coach she caused  Verague  to dress himself hastily and having concealed him in her Closet she presented herself before her Lady with an assured Countenance and assisted in undressing her as usual  As soon as she was dismissed she returned immediately to  Verague  but would not suffer him to attempt to go away till she thought the Count and her Lady were asleep The Door of this Woman's Room opened into the Countess's Antichamber  Verague  must necessarily pass through it to get to the back Stairs When  Marianne  thought he might venture safely she conducted him with as little Noise as possible to the Door however  the Count who was not asleep heard his Steps a fatal Curiosity to know who it was passing so late through his Lady's Apartment made him rise and throwing his Nightgown over him he went into the Antichamber  Verague  had stopt there a Moment to listen whether none of the Domestics were still up hearing the Count's Chamberdoor open he attempted to gain the Staircase but with so much Precipitation and Fear that he made a false Step upon the first Stair which gave the Count of  Berci  an Opportunity to lay hold on him  Verague  made desperate by his Fears for his own Life and the Dishonour of his Mistress took a Poignard he wore in his Bosom when he went upon such Adventures and endeavoured to disengage himself from the Count by wounding him in the Arm but the Count by a sudden Motion received the Stroke full in his Side  Verague  now easily breaking from his Hold ran down Stairs and climbing over the Walls of the Courtyard which were very low he got into a little Garden of the Door of which  Marianne  had given him a Key and escaped without Discovery  The unhappy Count of  Berci  fell to the Ground with the Stroke he had received and feeling his Blood flowing fast from his Wound he called for Help with a loud Voice His Gentleman whose Chamber was very near and who happened to be up and reading took up a Candle and ran to the Place  where his Lord's Voice had directed him At the Sight of the Count extended upon the Ground and covered with Blood he made the House resound with his Cries the Countess awaking in great Terrors and not finding her Lord beside her hastily arose threw on a loose Robe and calling  Marianne  flew out of her Apartment the Chevalier met her at the Head of the Staircase What a Spectacle for the Wife and the Friend the Count weltering in his Blood supported against the Wall while his Gentleman was endeavouring to bind up his Wound with his Cravat  Madam  de Berci  uttered a piercing Groan and sunk down by her almost expiring Lord the Chevalier for some Moments stood motionless with Grief and Amazement the Servants running from every Part of the House were preparing to take up their bleeding Master when the Chevalier roused from his silent Agony eagerly lent his trembling Arm and with the Assistance of his Gentleman carried the Count into his Chamber and laid him upon his Bed Surgeons were immediately sent for but he feeling his Strength almost exhausted turned his dying Eyes towards the Countess who supported by her Women stood at his Bedside in Anguish unutterable  Cease Madam said he to her cease to resign yourself to a fruitless Grief your Tears and your Despair cannot restore me to your Love but will embitter my last  Moments 'Tis done I have finished my Course parting with you is all the Grief I feel in Death but I return Thanks to Heaven for calling me away first and spareing me the Affliction of surviving you we have lived happy in each other's Affection I die contented and I conjure you with my last Breath not to revenge my Death I pardon the Authors of it continued he looking at  Marianne  who was in visible Agitations nor must you my dear Countess refuse me another Request it is said he taking the Chevalier's Hand who stood by him in an Agony of Grief that after my Death you will transfer the Affection you have borne me to this dear this faithful Friend let him possess my Place in your Heart bless him with your Hand and both of you cherish my RemembranceMay the God of all Mercies pursued the dying Count with Eyes fervently raised to Heaven pour down his choicest Blessings upon you and grant me an Asylum in the Bosom of my  He was not able to utter more his Hand lost its Hold of the Chevalier his Eyes for ever shut out the Light and faintly groaning he expired  The Chevalier ordered the Countess's Attendants to convey her instantly into another Chamber that she might not behold a Spectacle capable of shocking her Reason The Effects of her Grief were so much the more to be apprehended as it neither vented itself  in Tears or Complaint her Eyes remained always fixed on one Object like a Person in the last Agonies of Death a mortal Paleness overspread her Face for a while she seemed to have neither Sense or Motion at length she was seized with Convulsions which held her so long that her Life was despaired of It would have been happy for her had Fate then put a Period to her miserable Days but she was reserved to suffer greater Woes By the Force of Medicines she recovered to a Sense of Grief Painful Return to Life She now felt and deplored her Loss The Chevalier staid by her till the Convulsions had left her and her Reason was a little restored he neither could nor would attempt to console her that he judged must be the Work of Time and his Heart was too much oppressed by his own Sorrows to make him capable of administring Comfort to another  Mean time the News of this tragical Accident was carried to the Hotel of the Chevalier  des Essars  and changed the Mirth and Pleasures of the Ball into Tears and Lamentations every one ran with distracted Haste to the Count's Hotel an Assassination committed upon his Person in his own House at the dead of Night and by an unknown Hand filled all who heard it with Horror and Amazement a strict Search was ordered to be made but the Murderer could not be discovered all the Doors of the House were found fastened nor was it possible by any Circumstance that appeared  to form any certain Judgment All that could admit of no Doubt was that the Murder had been committed by one who had been all Night concealed in the House  During all this Time a thousand gloomy Reflexions rolled in the Mind of Monsieur  de Berci  the deceased Count's Brother He was resolved to spend all the rich Possessions he was left Heir to in discovering the Authors of the Assassination and revenging it he caused all the Men Servants to be carried to Prison and upon the Recital that was made him of his Brother's last words for he was not present having staid behind the Count and Countess at the Chevalier  des Essars  of the meaning look he had cast upon  Marianne  and the trouble and confusion it occasioned in her he made her be taken up likewise and conducted to Prison the Counts Servants went through the interrogatory and the innocence was no less apparent by the sincere Grief they shewed for the Loss of their Master than their clear and unvarying answers to the questions that were put to them  When  Marianne  was examined she absolutely disavowed having any Concern in the Murder and to remove any Suspicions that might be entertained against herself or her Lover she declared to the Lieutenant criminel with an amazing Confidence that it was from the Countess of  Berci  herself that they ought to seek an Explanation of that  dark affair she asserted that her Lady's passion for the Chevalier  des Essars  who had lain for some Time concealed in the House was doubtless the true Cause of the Count's Assassination to support this Charge she related all that had passed in the Castle of  Beauplan  the secret Interview between the Chevalier and Madam  de Berci  by Night her free Remonstrances to her Lady upon so shameful a Conduct which were so ill received that she dismissed her from her Service but at the Intercession of the Count's Brother to whom she had disclosed the Amour between the Chevalier and her Lady she had been pardoned by her and continued in her Place Hereupon the Lieutenant Criminal thought proper to have Monsieur  de Berci  examined his Answers agreed with  Marianne  's Deposition as far as it related to the Account she had given him of his Sisterinlaw's Amour with the Chevalier but he observed to that Magistrate that he had made  Marianne  's Peace with her Lady upon Condition that she should give him Notice of all her steps with Regard to the Chevalier that since that the Countess of  Berci  might have had many Opportunities of seeing the Chevalier in private if ever she had admitted of such a Freedom and  Marianne  could not have been unacquainted with it and would consequently have given him Notice of those stolen Interviews in Performance of her Promise but she had never done it therefore he concluded it was not in  her Power to give any such Proof of her Lady's Dishonour for it was not to be imagined that she who new accused Madam  de Berci  of being concerned in the Murder of her Lord would have neglected to discover a slighter Fault if she had been able The Lieutenant Criminel although he found some Reason in what Monsieur  de Berci  had urged in Favour of the Countess and that in the Deposition of  Marianne  only very light Presumptions could he formed against Madam  de Berci  and the Chevalier  des Essars  yet thought it necessary ta issue out an order for taking the Countess into custody Mosieur  de Berci  foresaw this he was fully persuaded of his Sisterinlaw's Innocence the Observations he had made to the Lieutenant Civil was the result of deep Reflexion on her Conduct her Grief for her Lord's Captivity the generous Sacrifice she had of her Jewels to procure his Release fearing that a much larger Sum would be demanded for his Ransom than they could immediat  ly Raise her unfeigned affliction for his Death which had brought her to the last Extremity the uncommon Friendship shewn by the Chevalier in making a Voyage to  Africk  to deliver the Count was all this consistent with a criminal Amour between them and such complicated Wickedness as the Assassination of the Count apparently the beloved Husband and the valued Friend of them who were accused to be the Authors of it Monsieur  de Berci  rejected the Thought with  Horror his Esteem and Affection for his Sisterinlaw increased in Proportion as he thought she suffered unjustly in her character he flew to inform her of the Order issued for seizing her and exhorted her with Tears to seek some Asylum where she might be secured against so cruel an Affront The Countess trembled with Horror at the news of her being suspected to be an Accomplice in so dreadful a Crime a generous Indignation took Place of those first Emotions and overspread her fair Face which ever since the Death of her Lord had lost all its Freshness with a transient Blush  Oh Woman cried she when her Brotherinlaw repeated to her the Deposition of  Marianne  Oh Woman unworthy of the Light detested Monster sent from Hell to be my destruction What reward dost thou promise thyself for thy infamous falshood Is it my Life thy wicked Malice aims at Alas it is now grown indifferent to me Grief would probably have done thy Work but that does not content thee I must dye upon a Scaffold and my Fame must be murdered as well as my Person Prosecute Wretch thy cruel Scheme the silent Testimony of a clear Conscience shall be my Comfort and the Review of a Life free from Reproach my Defence  Monsieur  de Berci  could not hear this affecting Apostrophe to that infamous Slanderer  without Tears and Execrations The Countess expressed a grateful Acknowledgment for the Interest he took in her Misfortunes She then desired him to send the Chevalier  des Essars  to her and as soon as he entered her Apartment she related to him all that her Brotherinlaw had told her concerning the wicked  Marianne  and her own impending Danger  The Chevalier was in Agonies at the Recital of so horrid a Calumny His Rage at the Aspersions cast upon the Countess and his Terrors at what might be the Consequence of them made him appear like one distracted he traversed the Chamber with a furious Pace forgetting that she was present and casting up his Eyes to Heaven seemed to upbraid it for permitting such Virtue to suffer But recollecting himself at length he approached the Countess with a calmer air and asked her what in the present Exigence she resolved to do begging her to command him freely whose Life was wholly devoted to her Service  The Countess who had taken her Resolution replied with great composure that her Innocence was her Security and that she would stand her Trial  The Chevalier who had not expected such Firmness was at first lost in Astonishment and Admiration but anxious for her Safety  and judging that there was no Time to lose he represented to her that she ought not to abandon a Life so precious to the precarious Judgments of Men often unjust and cruel Madam  de Berci  alledged that her Flight would give her the Appearance of Guilt that she would rely entirely upon her Innocence and the Interposition of Providence and wait patiently for the Event of such an undeserved Accusation  The Chevalier finding her determined to expose herself to all the Dangers that threatened her was almost distracted he threw himself at her Feet and with Tears conjured her to take Measures for preserving herself but she unmoved with all he could say obstinately persisted in her Resolution to suffer the horrors of Confinement in a dreadful Prison the infamy of a publick Trial and the Agony of a shameful Death if such was her Lot and with absolute Resignation to the will of Heaven drink the bitter Cup that was prepared for her  But at the same Time that the Countess thus fearlesly braved her own Fate she trembled at the Danger of a Man so deservedly dear to her she conjured him to fly and leave her to the Protection of Heaven the Chevalier declared that he would share her Fate whatever that might be Madam  de Berci  intreated wept all was in vain She then assumed an Appearance of Rage and  threatened never to pardon him if he refused to give her this last Proof of his obedience to her Will even this was ineffectual At last she told him that her Interest required he should be safe and at liberty that he might be able to assist her if her Enemies should bring Things to Extremity  This last Thought made some Impression upon the Chevalier he considered that if he should suffer himself to be taken the Count of  Polan's  friends would not fail to urge the King to have the Sentence he had pronounced executed upon him so that the Countess would be effectually deprived of all the Assistance he was able to give her he had many great and powerful Friends all of whom he could engage in the Interests of Madam  de Berci  while he continued free but when he was once in custody would have enough to do to procure his Pardon for the Death of the King's Favourite He therefore agreed to the Countess's Proposal determining within himself to die with her if he failed in his endeavours to save her  I go Madam said he with Tears in his Eyes in Obedience to your Commands as long as I can be useful to you my Life will be worth my Care and when it ceases to be so I know how to die  he kised her Hand as he pronounced these words and hurrying out of her Apartment met the two Marquisses  de SaintSauveur  who were come  hastily to see the Countess the Chevalier embraced them affectionately and recommending Madam  de Berci  to their tender Cares retired to the House of a faithful Friend where he determined to wait the Effect of her Resolution  He had scarce been gone two Hours when he was informed that the Countess had been arrested and notwithstanding the vigorous Efforts of her Relations to save her from such an Ignominy was conducted to the little Chatelet she had been torn out of the Arms of her Father and the young Marchioness  de SaintSauveur  who hung upon her while her unhappy Mother sunk upon the Ground in a fainting Fit at the Sight of the dreadful Officers of Justice who came to convey her to Prison  Oh blind and cruel Fortune shall Virtue ever be persecuted by thee and thy severest Malice be exercised upon those who most deserve thy Smiles  When the Countess entered the fatal Place which was henceforward to be her Habitation the melancholy Gloom the wretched Furniture the grated Windows the frightful Solitude filled her Mind with Horrors till then unfelt all that Fortitude the Pride of suffering Virtue the secret Calm of conscious Innocence upon which she had depended were too little to support her under such dreadful  Circumstances She had now none of that boasted Courage left which had lessened every Trial she could be called to and made her imagine herself more than equal to them all Filled with Horror and Despair she threw her streaming Eyes around the miserable Room surveying it with distracted Eagerness then sinking upon a Chair and giving a loose to the Anguish that oppressed her she wrung her Hands and struck her groaning Breast  Where art thou now unhappy Wretch cried she is thy once splendid Fortune reduced to this an Inmate of a horrid Prison confounded with the vilest Criminals branded with horrid Crimes and threatened with a shameful Death Ah my dearest Lord pursued she was not the Remembrance of thy unhappy Fate sufficient to afflict me but I must be charged with being the Author of it Just Heaven let me not find Fault with thy Decrees suffer not my rebellious Heart to murmur at my undeserved Woes let me submit with Patience to my Destiny and since I have lived with Innocence let me die with Resignation  The Woman who had been appointed to attend the Countess rather indeed to be a Spy upon her Behaviour than to do her Service could not hear this affecting Language without Tears The Youth and Beauty of Madam  de Berci  had the Moment she beheld her excited her Compassion and insensibly  removed that Prejudice which she had conceived against a Woman charged with so black a Crime she could not look on her and imagine her capable of Cruelty she could not hear her and believe her a Hypocrite After two or three Days Attendance upon her she discovered so much unaffected Piety in her Behaviour such Gentleness of Manners such perfect Resignation and such a calm yet steady Courage as persuaded her she was wholly innocent  Madam  de Berci  soon perceived this Woman had entertained favourable Thoughts of her her extreme Assiduity to oblige her the tender Concern she expressed for her Misfortunes drew from the grateful Countess Acknowledgments that entirely won her Heart The Unfortunate are ever ready to overrate the Benefits they receive because they are unexpected Madam  de Berci  although she shewed herself grateful in the highest Degree yet had a Dignity in her Manner which enhanced the Value of her Condescensions The Exigencies of her Situation required that she should court the Friendship of this Woman and she succeeded without Difficulty and without Humiliation the Horrors of her Confinement were in some Degree moderated by this Incident but the Shame and Disgrace she suffered and the Uncertainty of what might be her Fate innocent as she was was sufficient to overwhelm her with Sorrow Death was not what she dreaded her Miseries  had made Life hateful to her but to die loaded with Infamy to suffer the Stroke of an Executioner upon a public Scaffold branded with the Crimes of Adultery and Murder shocked her almost to Madness  After a Week's Imprisonment the Lieutenant Criminal entered suddenly into her Chamber in order to interrogate her she trembled at first at the Sight of this austere Magistrate the Thoughts of being obliged to answer like a Criminal in a Posture so unworthy of her Quality and Innocence threw her into some Confusion but here her Piety came to her Aid she humbled herself under the chastising Hand of the Almighty and with a perfect Submission to his Will suffered the ignominious Examination she confessed the Adventure of the Forest and the Interview she had had with the Chevalier  des Essars  in the Castle of  Beauplan  but she took God to Witness for the Innocence of her Intentions and her Conduct The Judge after taking her Confession in writing which he read to her and she signed withdrew  Neither the Countess of  Berci  nor  Marianne  had made any mention of  Verague  in their Examinations that Assassin was carefully concealed in  Paris  in the House of one of his near Relations He staid there for some Days to see what Turn the Affair would take but though he found himself in Safety he was tortured with the Stings of his own Guilt  This Man was a Gentleman by Birth he had not hitherto committed any flagrant Crimes the Terror he was in lest the Reputation of his Mistress should be blasted made him desperate he found he could not disengage himself from the Count who held him fast and called aloud for Lights his Situation gave him not Time for Reflexion it was necessary he should speedily escape for the Preservation of his own Life and his Mistress's Honour and he could no other ways effect it than by ridding himself of the Count guided by a sudden Impulse he stabbed him with his Poignard but aimed the Stroke at the Arm which held him the unfortunate Count received it in his Breast and  Verague  fled full of Horror at the Action he had committed and Fear of the Consequences When he found that the Countess of  Berci  and the Chevalier  des Essars  were accused of the Murder of the Count his Heart was touched with Remorse but he had neither Fortitude nor Generosity enough to clear their Innocence by confessing himself the Assassin of that unhappy Nobleman He could not however endure to be in a Place which every Moment recalled to him the Remembrance of his Crime for which two innocent Persons were persecuted he was apprehensive likewise that  Marianne  terrified at the fatal Consequences of her Guilt would endeavour to repair the Mischiefs she had been the Cause of and would deliver him up to Justice but he judged too favourably of that hardened  Wretch the Persecution she saw the Countess suffer gratified her Malice while it secured her Safety She could never forgive her for the severe Reproaches she made her on account of her Amour with  Verague  and for the Resolution she had taken to dismiss her from her Service  It is one of the greatest Triumphs of Vice to behold Virtue in Distress  Marianne  exulted in her own Mind over her suffering Lady and hardened herself in her Crime by reflecting on the Advantages she had now over that scrupulous Virtue which rather than wink at her Failings had exposed its Owner though innocent to all the Consequences of detected Guilt But  Verague  who had not even trusted her with the Place of his Concealment did not know the full Extent of his Wickedness and was ignorant of his own Security he therefore resolved to leave  Paris  and shelter himself in  England  but Change of Place could bring no Relief to the Tortures of his Mind the Blood he had shed haunted his Imagination with Horrors which made that Life he feared to lose insupportable to him and the Dangers the innocent Countess was exposed to through his Crime gave new Stings to a Conscience sufficiently wounded before  The Lieutenant Criminal was extremely concerned to find that the Chevalier  des Essars  had escaped his Vigilance the strictest  Search imaginable was made for him but to no Purpose he was perfectly safe in the Asylum he had chose but devoured with Melancholy and a Prey to the most bitter Reflections the Murder of his Friend the Sufferings of his beloved Countess were never out of his Thoughts and almost overturned his Reason  Madam  de Berci  who possessed more real Delicacy and Greatness of Mind than half her Sex had never when pressed by her Brotherinlaw to receive  Marianne  again into her Service taken the least Notice to him of the Cause for which she had dismissed her he therefore was wholly ignorant of her Intrigue with  Verague  She was silent likewise upon that Head when she was interrogated by the Lieutenant Criminal her Agonies when she beheld her Lord wounded to Death and weltering in his Blood were too great to suffer her Attention to be free enough to observe the conscious Look he gave  Marianne  and the Confusion it caused in that wicked Girl At times indeed she had some Suspicions of the Truth but as they were only Suspicions she did not think herself authorized to accuse any one Her Pride suggested to her likewise that she should level herself with her infamous Servant to retort Scandal for Scandal since she had no Means of proving her Assertions and  Marianne  had the Advantage of having first accused her which she thought would render every thing  she afterwards said suspected this false Reasoning was the Source of all her Miseries had she discovered her vile Woman's Amour with  Verague  his Flight with several other concurring Circumstances would have made him known to have been the Author of her Lord's Assissination but she herself was ignorant of his having left  France  and as none of her Family knew of his Connexion with  Marianne  it was a Circumstance not attended to by them and if not by them no other Person had any Concern in it Madam  de Berci  trusting her Justification to Providence consoled herself with the Consciousness of her Innocence and in her Piety and Resignation to the Will of Heaven found a Support that enabled her to undergo her Afflictions  Mean time the Chevalier never one Moment forgot the lovely Prisoner as he could not solicit her Cause openly he engaged all his Friends in her Interest the Ardor and Zeal with which they undertook her Defence were so much the greater as they were convinced of her Innocence and that of their Friend even the Public though often very unjust in its Censures could not be persuaded that this brave Man was capable of committing a Crime so unworthy of his Courage his Generosity and his Birth those only who were Strangers to his Fame and his great Qualities and the Friends of the Count of  Polan  whom he had killed in his last Duel  were capable of saying that he was the Author of so detestable an Action  The two Marquesses  de SaintSauveur  were inconceivably afflicted for the Misfortunes of the Countess but her Mother and her new Sisterinlaw were in a Condition truly pitiable the Sorrow of that tender Friend for the undeserved Sufferings of Madam  de Berci  was equal to that of her who had given her Birth Under what fatal Auspices had  Hymen  lighted his Torch for her Her Nuptials resembled a Funeral rather than a Bridal Solemnity Tears Groans and agonizing Aprehensions left no room for Love or Joy None of the Relations of Madam  de Berci  entertained the slightest Suspicion of her Virtue they were alike convinced of the Honour and Probity of the Chevalier they knew where he lay concealed and often visited him to lament the hard Fate of the innocent Countess and to concert Measures for her Relief  That unfortunate Lady was not allowed the Consolation of seeing her Friends her Father and Mother were denied Permission to visit her Yet amidst this complicated Misery her Mind was composed her Behaviour expressed a calm and decent Sorrow and in that the Death of her Lord had greater Part than her own Disgrace and Danger  The old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  although he had a great Opinion of his Daughter's Virtue  and the highest Veneration for the Chevalier  des Essars  yet was greatly surprised when he was informed of the Circumstances of  Marianne's  Deposition concerning the Chevalier's Passion for his Daughter He resolved to get some Explanation of this Matter from him for which Purpose he went alone to visit him one Day and entering immediately upon the Point he told him that the only Circumstance which made his Daughter's Innocence doubtful were the violent Presumptions formed against her by the Judges on account of the Passion he was said to have entertained for her and which was proved by the Depositions of the Count's Brother and her Woman  The Chevalier was in some little Confusion at this Discourse he blushed and cast down his Eyes for a few Moments he was silent and in terrible Uneasiness The old Marquis in great Agitations pressed him to speak the Chevalier disdained a Lie reassuring himself therefore in a Moment he replied with that Confidence which is always the Companion of Innocence and Rectitude of Mind  It is true my Lord I do love the Countess of  Berci  your Daughter I loved her before I knew her unfortunate Lord whose Death you cannot more sincerely lament than I do Her Beauty charmed me while I was yet ignorant of her being married  and when I knew it her Wisdom and Virtue rivetted my Chains She might possibly have been ignorant of this Passion till now had I not discovered it by my Complaints in the Forest of  Beauplan  I did not imagine I could be overheard amidst the Solitude of that vast Forest I freely disburthened my Heart and Chance brought the Countess and her Brotherinlaw within Hearing That young Lord for his Sister's Justification ought to have remembered that I expressed the sincerest Friendship for the Count which my Actions have since proved that I trembled lest my involuntary Passion should offend the Virtue I adored and that I hoped for no other Reward than her Compassion I acknowledge farther that I once had a private Interview with the Countess in the Castle of  Beauplan  she granted me this Favour in Consideration of the Service I had the good Fortune to do you I had no Intention of making a Merit with her by that Service as you my Lord well know by my Solicitude to conceal my Name Madam  de Berci  saw me indeed but it was to reprove me for my misplaced Love she convinced me I could never hope to obtain any Favour of her inconsistent with the strictest Duty and tenderest Affection to her Lord and what is more she brought me myself to desire no other to be contented with her Friendship and to aim at no higher Satisfaction than the Glory of serving her Lord  and giving her such Proofs of my Passion as the severest Virtue must not only not condemn but approve Is it possible that the Judges should reflect upon the whole Tenor of my Conduct with regard to the Count of  Berci  yet impute his Murder to me Was it probable that I would take a Voyage to  Africa  in which I run the Risque of being delivered up to the Laws of my Country which I had offended by killing the Count of  Polan  or of being made a Slave myself to deliver the Count from his Fetters only to become his Assassin Did I expose my Life to save his at the Siege of  Ostend  only to deprive him of it by a Midnight Murder when I returned into  France  Ah my Lord do me the Justice to believe that I mention not these Things with any other View but to clear the Innocence of the Countess and to defend my own Honour from the unjust Censures that have been cast upon it Yon Star that gilds the Firmament is not clearer than your Daughter's Virtue nor more spotless than her Mind He who reads Hearts who knows our Thoughts as they rise spontaneous in the Mind can witness how pure mine have been with regard to the Countess your Daughter Ah my Lord if my Passion for that virtuous Lady had been criminal if it had suggested base Desires I should have rejoiced at the Captivity of her Lord and not have exposed myself to Slavery to redeem him to save him from Death I  should not have run between him and his Enemies and received the Strokes aimed at his upon my own Breast  Dear Chevalier interrupted the old Marquis convinced by the Force of these Reasons forgive me for the Necessity I have laid you under of defending that Honour and Generosity of which my whole Family has had such striking Proofs I am ashamed that I have for one Moment suffered a Doubt to rise in my Mind concerning your Love for my Daughter that Love must have been honourable and pure for mean and base Passions could never have a Place in such a noble Mind Once more forgive me and allow me to hope that I have not forfeited your Friendship by this Trial of your Goodness  The Chevalier made no other Answer than a strict Embrace to which the old Marquis had invited him as he uttered these last Words by opening his Arms and going towards him Tears of Joy and Tenderness fell from the Chevalier's Eyes at the recovered good Opinion of the Father of her whom he so religiously adored but these pleasing Emotions soon gave Way to others caused by the Remembrance of the Countess's Sufferings They conferred together upon what Measures were proper to be taken to remove the Prejudices of the Judges but all their Efforts were to no Purpose the supposed  Amour between the Chevalier and the Countess gave every Thing so black an Appearance on the Side of the Lovers that those Magistrates issued an Order for Madam  de Berci  's being put to the Question to force her to reveal what she knew of the Assassination of her Lord  When this News was brought to the Family  de SaintSauveur  the Grief they had hitherto suffered on account of her Imprisonment was so light to that they now felt that they thought they had never been miserable till now the whole House was filled with Cries and Lamentations the unhappy Mother beat her groaning Breast and prostrate on the Ground in agonising Sorrow beseeched Heaven to have Mercy upon her Child But the unfinished Prayer scarce passed her Lips when the Image of her Daughter's threatned Pains rising to her tortured Imagination her Grief rose up to frensy wildly she rent her reverend Hairs and wrung her Hands casting by Intervals her streaming Eyes to Heaven from whence she only hoped Relief the young Marchioness in the Arms of her Woman fell into successive Faintings that made them tremble for her Life the two Marquisses  de SaintSauveur  endeavoured to console the Ladies but wanted themselves the Support they would have given  But no Words can describe the mingled Rage Despair and Anguish which took  Possession of the Chevalier's Soul at the dreadful News the very Idea of torturing that lovely Frame drove him almost to Distraction he could not bear to think her Ears had been wounded with the ignominious Sentence regardless of his Safety he quitted his Retreat and flew to his own Hotel where the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and his Family still resided The Sight of his afflicted Friends gave him up for a few Moments to Tears they could not speak to each other no one could bear to mention the horrid Sentence The Chevalier at length recollecting himself and starting as if newly awaked from a frightful Dream approached the wretched Mother and taking her Hand with a Countenance and Tone of Voice that darted a Ray of Comfort into her Soul thus spoke to her  Heaven Madam has inspired me with a Design which may relieve the Countess and restore you tranquility suspend your Grief for a few Days and depend upon it I will save her or perish in the Attempt  The old Marchioness could only press his Hand and by an ardent Ejaculation implore the Assistance of Heaven upon his Enterprize the Chevalier then taking the two Marquisses aside told them that it being now near the End of Advent it was probable the ignominious Sentence might be put in Execution before  Christmas  he therefore desired he would solicit the King to put  off by his Authority the Decision of the Process till after Twelfthnight In great Afflictions it is natural for the Mind to fasten upon any thing that affords the least Probability of Relief the well known Courage of the Chevalier his enterprizing Temper and the Prudence and Fortitude which he possessed in a very high Degree gave such Force to his Assurances that he would deliver the Countess from her Confinement though with the Loss of his Life if that short Interval could be obtained that they readily and not without some Degree of Hope and Comfort undertook to procure by the Mediation of their Friends the required Delay In Effect the King whose Indulgence for the charming Sex made up a great Part of his Character was prevailed upon to interpose his Authority to procure the unhappy Countess this short Relief The Chevalier was overioyed and immediately began to execute the Project he had formed  Between the little Chatelet and the Bridge there is a Street inhabited only by Butchers whither no one comes but such as have Occasion to purchase Meat because it is not a Thoroughfare The Chevalier having long before been informed that the Chamber in which the unfortunate Countess was confined looked into this Street had upon that Circumstance laid the Foundation of his Design Having put on a plain Dress and turned up his own fine Hair under a Wig which served  for a tolerable Disguise he went very early in the Morning to this little Street as at that Hour there was no Probability that any one would come to buy Provisions he walked leisurely down it to take a View of the Situation of the Countess's Prison and observed that a Grate of the Chatelet looked upon a Window of a House which was so near it that there was only the Breadth of that Street between them the Grate was indeed a little higher than the Window The Chevalier was approaching this House when he observed that the Mistress of it was employed in opening her Shop the Woman struck with his Air and Mien notwithstanding the Plainness of his Dress was surprised to see a Person whom she concluded to be of some Rank at that early Hour in an unfrequented Street But the Chevalier did not give her Time to make many reflections he accosted her with great Civility and told her it was in her Power to do him a very considerable Service which he would not fail to reward generously and as an Earnest of what he would farther do for her in Case she was so good as to assist him he begged she would accept that Trifle saying which he put a Purse that contained fifty Crowns in her Hand The Woman was astonished at the Value of such a Present which conciliated her good Will even more than the insinuating Person and Address of the Chevalier though Beauty never fails to have its due Weight  with that Sex She desired him to come in and was prudent enough not to let him stand in the Shop for fear of Observation for she found her Interest engaged in this strange Gentleman's Business whatever it might be and that made her extremely wary The Chevalier joyfully accepted of her Invitation he followed her into the little Room she led to and after prefacing his Story with some Praises of her Benevolence which he accompanied with a Salute and a gentle Pressure of her Hand that extremely prepossessed her in his Favour for Women in her low Class think themselves highly honoured by such Sort of Notice from Men of the Rank the Chevalier appeared to be he told her that in the Chatelet there was Prisoner a Lady who was a near Relation of his that he had the Management of her Affairs but that she had been so closely confined for some Time past that he had not been able to give her any Informations concerning her Process nor to receive any Instructions from her all which was extremely prejudicial to her Cause He assured her that the Favour he required of her could be productive of no Inconvenience either to her or her Husband it being only to lend him for two or three Days a Room in her House that was opposite to the Grate the Use he intended to make of it he said was to convey a Letter to his distressed Relation to give her Notice of something which was of the utmost Consequence to her Safety He concluded with assuring her that if God  through her Assistance should enable him as he hoped to justify the Innocence of the Lady he would give her a much more considerable Proof of his Gratitude than that she had already received  The Populace of  Paris  are naturally compassionate they are always ready to assist any one in the Circumstances the Chevalier described this Lady to be in when it is to cost them nothing but when for that Assistance Gratuities so considerable as the Chevalier's Present are offered there is nothing but what may be expected from their obliging Officiousness The Woman won by the Sum she had in Hand and the flattering Hopes of a much greater offered the Chevalier not only that Room but her whole House if it could be of any Service to him assuring him she would keep his Secret faithfully which the Chevalier having engaged her so far in his Interests had no Reason to doubt She began immediately to make good her Promises and conducted the Chevalier into the Room he desired to be shewn to The Husband upon hearing them there ran to see who was with his Wife She was young and tolerably handsome his Jealousy was awakened at the Sight of a fine Gentleman in Conference with her and he did not fail to give some Marks of his Dissatisfaction but this lasted no longer than till he was informed of the Occasion of such a suspected Visit the Sight of fifty Crowns instantly dispelled the  Cloud on his Brow and he surpassed his Wife in Civility intreating the Gentleman to be assured that himself and all he had was at his Service At any other Time the Chevalier would have smiled at such a sudden Transition from Disgust to a Profusion of Kindnesses but the Importance of his Design filled all his Thought The Butcher told him that the Chamber which had that Grate in it was the best in the Chatelet where only Persons of Quality were used to be confined and that he believed there was at present in it a Lady of Distinction who was accused of being concerned with a Gallant in the Assassination of her Husband The Chevalier could not help sighing at these Words but recollecting himself he desired the Man with great Composure to bring him the necessary Materials for writing his only View being to convey a Letter to the Hands of his Kinswoman The Butcher flew to get him what he wanted and the Chevalier having finished his Letter fastened it to a small Cord together with a little Inkhorn some Paper and a Pen The Grate was doublebarred and very close he saw it would be very difficult to throw in this little Packet however he flung it several times directing it as near as possible to the Mark at last it had the good Fortune to enter he let go the Packthread that the Countess might draw it all in through this Grate That unhappy Lady was upon her Knees just opposite to it she saw something fall on the Ground and her Imagination being  heated with the Fervency of her Devotion she concluded that Heaven had heard her Prayer and had sent her Comfort She took up the Packet immediately and drew in the rest of the Packthread which was hanging on the Outside of her Chamber The Paper the Inkhorn and the Pen which she saw tied up all together surprised her at first for the Confusion of her Thoughts were so great that she could not guess for what Reason those Things were sent her but when she opened the Chevalier's Letter her Apprehension was a little quickened It contained these Words  'MADAM  Although I would sacrifice my Life to free you from the smallest Uneasiness yet at present I rather chuse to increase your Grief by informing you of the Dangers with which you are threatened than lose by my Silence the Means of delivering you from them But ah Madam how can I write the Words You are to be sentenced immediately after Twelfthnight Your Courage your Fortitude your glorious Resignation what will they all avail you against the cruel Fate that is preparing for you But I cannot will not blot a Paper which I hope will reach your lovely Hands with the abhorred Sentence Let me conjure you Madam by the heartbreaking Sorrows of your wretched Mother by your Father's Anguish the Tears of your new Sister the  Distress of your noble Brother by the Affliction of all your Friends who take such tender Interest in your Sufferings do not oppose my Endeavours to set you free I am authorised by your unhappy Parents to make some Attempt to save you oh be not blinded by false Honour to throw away a Life so precious Let me have your Consent to deliver you and hope every Thing from Heaven's Assistance and my Zeal to serve you I am now waiting for your Answer as soon as you have wrote it throw it out of your Grate without troubling yourself about its Fate only give me Permission Madam to save a Life upon which my own so absolutely depends  The Countess read this Letter with a Variety of strong Emotions her Heart felt an involuntary Transport at this new Proof of the Chevalier's Tenderness and Constancy She well knew his natural Intrepidity and did not doubt but he was capable of undertaking any Enterprise to preserve her That good Fortune which had hitherto always attended him in any hazardous Attempt seemed to promise him Success in this she could not think of being delivered from that Place of Horror without indulging a momentary Joy heigthened with the Reflexion that the Man to whom she was most willing to be obliged would be her Deliverer But this last Thought gave Rise to another which filled her with Confusion and Uneasiness  she recollected that this Deliverer so dear to her was in the Opinion of the World the Assassin of her Husband if she accepted his offered Services would it not confirm that horrid Suspicion and be productive of Dangers to both She could not bear the Thought of giving such a Sanction to the vile Reports that were spread of a guilty Commerce between her and the Chevalier as the flying from her Prison would do No cried she weeping let me die with the Satisfaction of having done nothing to deserve the cruel Censures that have been past upon me In vain she endeavoured to fortify herself against the Fears of Death by a Consideration of what she owed her Honour the very Idea of the cruel and ignominious Torture she was to suffer overthrew all her Constancy and now wholly engrossed by those Terrors she resolved to suffer no more Scruples to rise in her Mind but rather hazard the Loss of her Reputation for a little Time than lose it effectually together with her Life She had not sufficiently attended to the Force of the Chevalier's former Arguments against her trusting to the Judgments of Men which cannot but be fallible She had not Time to reflect on the Consequences of the Step she had determined to take In that Enthusiasm inspired by Innocence and Grief she braved her Fate and only sensible to Dishonour feared neither the Horrors of a Prison nor the threatened Death Doubtless her Mind had been supported with the  Hope that her Innocence would be manifested in spite of the Malice of her Accusers and that a short Disgrace would be recompensed by a noble Testimony to her Honour But her Situation was now greatly altered her Fame was wounded deeply her Punishment was certain and not far off  One reasons very differently when a Danger is near and unavoidable from what one does while it is yet doubtful and only threatens at a Distance The Love of Life so natural to a young and beautiful Woman whose Heart was filled with the softest of all Passions repelled every other Thought but what tended to her own Preservation she no longer deferred taking her Resolution it was to live whatever Construction the World might put upon her Conduct She made use of the Materials the Chevalier had sent her for writing and answered his Letter in the following Manner  I will abandon myself entirely to your generous Cares and ardent Desire to serve me provided that after you have delivered me from this Place of Horror you will immediately resign me to my Father's Protection the Enterprize you have engaged in is generous and noble but alas Chevalier it is very difficult to execute but remember that I expect you will act with so much Prudence that while you are endeavouring to preserve my Life you may not  endanger your own Restrain the Impetuosity of your Courage in Affairs of this Nature the Arts of Contrivance are most wanted Adieu Chevalier I shall be full of Anxiety till I hear from you again  Although the Countess had entirely gained the Heart of the Woman who had been put about her yet she did not think proper to impart her Secret to her so soon she only told her that a Friend who was greatly interested in her Misfortunes had found Means to convey a Letter to her to comfort her under her severe Trials The Pleasure the Woman expressed at hearing this small Piece of good Fortune for the Countess made her with good Reason judge that when Matters were riper she might safely engage her Assistance The Chevalier mean time suffered great Uneasiness and Perplexity while the Countess was employed in deliberating what Part she should take and afterwards in writing her Answer the poor Chevalier tortured with Anxiety planted himself at the Chamberwindow his Eyes were continually turned towards the fatal Grate he trembled lest he had mistaken the Room where the Countess was confined and that the Letter had fallen into other Hands But at length after being long racked between Expectation and Fear he saw a Bit of Paper fall into the Street his Heart bounded to his Mouth with trembling Impatience he ran down the Stairs to take it up but could not come Time  enough to prevent a Bailiff who had unfortunately entered that Shop to buy some Meat from seizing the Paper which he was opening when the Chevalier approached him and desired him very civily to give it to him saying it was a Paper he himself had let fall The Bailiff's Curiosity to see the Contents of that Paper was greatly heightened by the apparent Agitation of the Chevalier he was a little slow in returning it the Chevalier almost distracted with his Fears of what might happen from such an unlucky Circumstance staid no longer to intreat but snatcht the Paper out of his Hands and run away as fast as his Legs could carry him behind the Chatelet on that Side near the Church of  Notre Dame  with all the other Bailiffs who were then at the Barriere and a confused Rabble at his Heels who cried aloud Stop stop him he has killed a Man This Cry made several Persons throw themselves in his Way and endeavour to seize him but these Enemies were not near so formidable as those behind he conceived he might easily terrify them by holding his drawn Sword in his Hand and in Effect the Sight of it and the Chevalier's threatening Looks so intimidated them that not one would venture to lay hold on him but on the contrary opened him a Passage through the Coaches and Chariots with which the little Bridge is always crouded He escaped thus from the Croud and going through Bystreets he arrived safe at the House of his Friend where  he read Madam  de Berci's  Billet with infinite Satisfaction  The Chevalier had not acquainted his Friend with his Design of delivering the Countess but he now told it him together with the Danger he had lately escaped Monsieur  la Ronvere  for that was the Name of this faithful Friend of the Chevalier's blamed him greatly for his Rashness and told him that he with less Danger and equal Success might have transacted the Business with the Butcher and his Wife and have conveyed the Letter to and from the Lady safe The Chevalier embraced him tenderly and thanking him for his Zeal represented to him that on this Occasion if he attempted to serve the Countess and was discovered it might create a Suspicion that he lay concealed in his House and if that happened he should either be apprehended or obliged to leave  Paris  to avoid it either of which in the melancholy Situation the Countess was in would be worse than Death to him as it would leave him no Possibility of assisting her  But interrupted Monsieur  la Rouvere  in what manner do you propose to convey Letters to her now for it would be Madness to prosecute your former Scheme If you return again to the Butchers you will infallibly have all the Bailiffs to contend with and probably the Mob of  Paris  likewise in which Case a Discovery of your Person would be the certain Consequence  I have thought of an admirable Expedient replied the Chevalier after a little Pause I will as soon as it is Night dress myself like a Beggar and be so well disguised that you shall hardly know me I will creep along the Street asking Alms till I get near the Chatelet where I will attempt two Things the one is to send another Line to the Countess by the same Conveyance as before and the other to procure if possible an Interview with the Turnkey of the Prison and try if with the Hopes of a considerable Reward I can prevail with him to let the Countess escape Although I should spend all my Estate pursued the Chevalier with great Emotion in this Design I shall yet be too happy and too rich if I procure her Liberty for which I would readily sacrifice my Life  Monsieur  la Ronvere  approved of his Friend's Scheme  But in order to render the Success of it less uncertain said he I think it will be necessary that I should follow you at a Distance with four or five Servants well armed to prevent any Accident happening to you if you should be known and I would advise you continued he to take Money with you to give immediately to the Turnkey for you deceive yourself if you imagine he will listen to  your Proposals unless he is softened by the Sight of that persuasive Metal And it is possible that without such a powerful Advocate he may seize your Person for tempting him to betray his Trust I think in the Letter you write to the Countess you should desire her to sound this Man and if she finds him disposed to serve her to tell him that one of her Friends designed to have a Conference with him this Night concerning her Affairs she may likewise promise him a considerable Sum which you shall fix in your Letter and have it ready with you to give him in case he complies The Countess will certainly have a better Opportunity to enter upon this Negotiation than you can have and when she has once begun you may conclude it happily together  The Chevalier approved of his Friend's Advice and waited with an ardent Impatience for the Hour in which he was to put his Project in Execution After a short Dinner he wrote to the Countess depending upon conveying it to her in the same manner as he had done in the Morning he then put on some ragged Cloaths torne Stockings and an old Pair of Shoes one of which wanted a Heel and helped to give him a hobbling Gate his Hair was all tied up under the miserable Remains of a Wig that had once been fair but now looked like a darkish red a large black Patch covered  half one Side of his Face and upon the whole he was so well disguised that had he been met by his most intimate Friends he would not have been known  In this Equipage he set out in the Evening followed at a distance by his Friend and two stout Footmen The Chevalier was not without Apprehensions of meeting with some unlucky Accident like that in the Morning and was grieved that he had not been able to take his Sword along with him for he was armed only with a little Poignard which he concealed in his Breast When he  as  ed the Chatelet he left the Barriere where the B  liffs sit and on his left Hand entered the  Street of the Butcher's leaving his Friend and his Servants to walk leisurely between the little Bridge and the Entrance to the Street  St Jacques  He went immediately to his friendly Butcher whom he found in great Concern about him they did not know him again till he sp  ke to them and overjoyed that he had so happily escaped from the Bailiffs and the Mob that had pursued him in the Morning they conducted him instantly to the Chamber from whence he had thrown his former Letter into the Grate as he did this likewise with equal Success He desired the Countess in it to prepare the Turnkey for an Interview with him at Nine o'Clock that Night and to let him know that he should receive five hundred Crowns in Hand and a thousand  more as soon as he had delivered up his Prisoner  The Countess whose Thoughts had been busied in contriving Means to facilitate her Escape ever since she had received the Chevalier's first Letter had actually hit on the same Expedient and had sounded the Turnkey that very Day he had listened to her with great Attention and Complacency but had promised nothing in particular he only expressed great Compassion for her Misfortunes and an Inclination to do her all the Service that was in his Power Madam  de Berci  was overjoyed to see a second Billet from the Chevalier fall into her Chamber she was still more pleased with the Contents of it and thought it a favourable Circumstance that the Chevalier and herself had made Choice of the same Scheme to effect her Liberty She wrote an Answer immediately in which she told the Chevalier that she would give the Turnkey a Present when he came with her Supper as usual and make him the Offers mentioned in his Letter She desired him not to come to the Chatelet till Ten o'clock at Night at which Hour she hoped to prevail upon the Turnkey to meet him The Chevalier went down into the Street that he might be ready to take up the Countess's Billet as soon as he saw it fall he had the good Fortune to secure it in his Pocket without being perceived But he fell into another Scrape which was much  more dangerous than the Adventure that happened to him in the Morning  It was formerly a Custom in  Paris  on  Christmas Eve  for a Commissary attended with a certain Number of Archers to walk through the Streets and take up all the Poor they met who during that solemn Festival were carried by Force if they would not go voluntarily to a Place prepared for their Reception where they were cloathed and supported with the Money that was found in the Poor's Boxes in Churches and with the Alms given by charitable Persons The Chevalier as he was returning to meet his Friends was met by the Commissary and his Guard the Archers concluding the Chevalier was a Beggar invited him to follow them he refused and two or three of the Archers laid hold on him in order to force him along with them wondering at the Folly of the miserable Wretch who refused to go to a Place where he would be cloathed and fed for a certain Number of Days the Chevalier finding they were resolved to compel him to accept of this Charity resisted them with so much Strength and Obstinacy that they grew weary of contending with him and left him at Liberty to go where he pleased His Friend who at a Distance saw what passed advanced with his two Servants under Pretence of asking what was the Matter and favoured the Chevalier's Retreat In Effect he happily escaped this Danger and arrived safe at his Friend's House  where he was soon followed by Monsieur  le Ronvere  and they read Madam  de Berci's  Billet with great Joy They entertained themselves at Supper with the pleasing Hopes of soon freeing that persecuted innocent Lady from her Confinement and as soon as they had supped they went to present themselves at the Chatelet at the appointed Hour They were attended by several Servants well armed so that if the Turnkey should prove perfidious they were in a Condition to take Revenge on him and to defend themselves against any that should offer to seize them  In the mean time Madam  de Berci  took an Opportunity to speak to the Turnkey when he brought her Supper into her Chamber She had about four hundred Crowns in her Purse which she divided between the Turnkey and the Woman that attended her she told them that she made them that Present in return for their obliging Behaviour to her ever since she had been a Prisoner and that if God was pleased to make her Innocence manifest and she was restored to her Liberty she would give them further Proofs of her Gratitude She mentioned the approaching Trial she was to undergo and bursting into Tears assured them that no Tortures should extort from her the Confession of a Crime she had never committed and if she died under them she hoped Justice would be done to her Memory  The Woman wept bitterly at this Discourse the Turnkey was greatly affected A Lady so young so lovely of such high Birth and in all Appearance so innocent to be put to the Torture was a Thought he could not endure  how meritorious would it be whispered he to the Woman if we could preserve this Lady from the cruel Fate with which she is threatened  The Woman although she durst not be the first to make such a Proposal was overjoyed that he had mentioned it she eagerly assured him that she would run any Hazard to save her The Countess observed their Whispers her Heart divided between Fear and Hope beat with unusual Violence At length they approached her she waited trembling for the Result of their Conference judging that her Destiny depended upon the Resolution they had taken The Turnkey addressing her with Tears in his Eyes urged her to make her Escape and both he and the Woman assured her that they would venture their Lives to assist her He told her that it should be his Part to deliver her out of Prison provided she had any Person in whom she could conside that would receive her from him at the Gate of the Chatelet and conduct her out of  Paris  The Countess was transported to see them enter so readily into her Measures such unhopedfor good Fortune made her doubtful whether she was not in a Dream but recollecting herself she heedfully observed the Countenances of her two Friends  and saw so many Marks of real Sorrow and Tenderness imprinted on them that she was persuaded they were sincere in their Professions She then opened herself more freely to them and assured them that they should have no Reason to repent of what they did for her Service that they might hope every thing from her Generosity and Gratitude and that they should be largely recompensed for the Advantages they quitted in the Chatelet to set her at Liberty that if he was in Earnest in his Offers she had a Friend who would that very Night give him five hundred Crowns and when he delivered her in to his Hands a thousand more she assured him that he might depend upon this Promise but that he must be also exact in the Performance of his for that if he should fail no Place on Earth would be able to shelter him from the Vengeance of her Friend She added that he might make his Fortune in one Day if he pleased and he enabled to quit a Profession which could not but be very disagreeable to one who had any Humanity or Generosity  The Turnkey unalterably fixed in his Resolution of delivering her by such great Offers assured her with the most sacred Oaths that he would perform his Promise in the Countess then shewed him the Letter she had received from the Chevaller and it was resolved that the Turnkey should give him a Meeting that Night in order to receive the  five hundred Crowns and to six the Day for her Escape  The Turnkey did not fail to go out of the Chatelet at the appointed Hour and seeing two Men at a little Distance from the Gat  he concluded they must be the Lady's Friends who were waiting for him One of them who was the Chevalier  des Essars  advanced immediately and asked him if it was he that carried Provisions into the Chamber of a Lady who was Prisoner in the Chatelet The Turnkey replied he was and that the Lady had sent him to confer with him concerning the Means to set her at Liberty The Chevalier was overjoyed at these Words he found by them that Madam  de Berci  had been successful and taking out of his Pocket a Purse in which were five hundred Crowns in Gold  Friend said he to the Turnkey putting it into his Hand receive this small Earnest of my Gratitude and depend upon being rewarded with a Sum much larger provided you will Tomorrow deliver your Prisoner into my Hands But do not deceive me added he for if you do I will take away your Life though I sacrifice my own  I will not deceive you replied the Turnkey receiving the Purse but I cannot promise you to free the Lady before  Saint John's  Day my Master always keeps that Festival and makes a great Entertainment in the Chatelet to which all his Friends and Relations are invited they  will not fail to drink deep and I hope I shall find some Opportunity that Evening to acquit myself of the Promise I have made you to deliver the Lady that Promise I here repeat to you Monsieur and engage at the Hazard of my Life to bring the Lady at Twelve o'Clock that Night to the Newmarket where you must be ready to receive her but till then you must have Patience and do not attempt to convey any more Letters to her for fear any thing should happen that may discover the Correspondence we hold together Again Monsieur I beg you to rely upon my Sincerity and doubt not but I will faithfully perform my Promise  The Turnkey then urged him to depart lest they should by some prying Eye be observed in Discourse together The Chevalier repeating his Promise of a further Reward and recommending Caution and Zeal in the Lady's Service rejoined his Friend to whom he related all that had passed between him and the Turnkey This fortunate Beginning seemed such an Earnest of happy Success that the Chevalier resigned himself up to a Joy he had long been unacquainted with He would not Delay a Moment relieving the Anxiety of the sorrowing Parents before he went to his Friend's Hotel he called upon the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and gave him Hopes that he should behold his Daughter at Liberty The Chevalier did not think it  proper to toll them what Measures he was pursuing to bring about this happy Event but those few Words transported them with Joy They endeavoured to interest all Heaven in his Favour by the most ardent Supplications and he retired loaded with their Blessings and Praises  The next Day the Turnkey informed Madam  de Berci  of his having settled every thing with her Friend and that on the Festival of  Saint John  he hoped to be able to deliver her into his Hands How sweet were the Hopes of Liberty to that unhappy Lady who had so long languished amidst the Horrors of a Prison She now for the first time since her Entrance into that fatal Place felt some Remission of her Grief Her Mind admitted a Hope of once more being happy She dwelt with Pleasure on the Remembrance of all the Services she had received from the Chevalier and having no longer tyrannic Duty to combat with indulged a Tenderness authorized by her Husband's dying Command and his own exalted Merit In such agreeable Reflexions she lessened that Interval of Time which otherwise would have appeared so tedious Yet she was often alarmed with Fears that their Enterprize would be discovered and that Anxiety so natural to Persons in Suspence sometimes damped her Joy for the near Prospect of her Liberty and gave her up to Terror and Despondence  At length the Day so impatiently wishedfor appeared The Jailor celebrated the Festival with a great Entertainment as usual They prolonged the Debauch to a later Hour than ever they had done before which was a very unfavourable Circumstance The Turnkey had given Notice to the Countess and the Chevalier to hold themselves in Readiness at Eleven o'Clock the one in her Chamber the other at the Newmarket They both were persuaded that if they lost this Opportunity it would be very difficult to find another and that it would not be possible to procure a further Delay of the Sentence against the Countess The Chevalier posted himself with his Friend and four other Gentlemen well armed at the appointed Place With such an Escort they had nothing to fear from the Archers if they should be betrayed and they were determined if they once got the Countess out of the Chatelet to kill all that opposed them rather than suffer her to be taken from them When the Clock struck Eleven an universal Trembling seized the poor Countess her Heart beat as if it would leave her Breast anxiously she listened to every little Noise and longed with eager Impatience to hear the softly treading Foot of her Deliverer nor was the Chevalier under less Agitations when he heard the important Hour strike Fear and Hope for some Moments equally divided his Soul but when he found the Turnkey did not appear he was almost distracted he thought his beloved Countess  wholly lost and in the Agony of his Grief and Despair he was for going forward to the Chatelet and making some desperate Attempt to relieve her  The Turnkey at length appeared but without the Countess the Chevalier  des Essars  transported with Rage was for sacrificing him instantly to his Revenge supposing he had betrayed him The Turnkey seeing the Chevalier advance in a threatening Posture begged him to listen patiently to him for one Moment he then assured him that nothing had hindered him from performing his Promise but the unexpected Stay of the Guests to a later Hour than usual that they were now all gone and that his Master was preparing to go to Bed where he did not doubt but he would be soon fast asleep for he had drank deep and was greatly intoxicated He intreated him to wait patiently a little Time longer when he would infallibly bring out the Prisoner  This Assurance calmed the Rage of the Chevalier and dissipated his Uneasiness but the poor Countess was in dreadful Agonies She had counted the Hour by several different Clocks which she heard strike but not seeing her Deliverer she flattered herself that her Impatience had made her mistake The Turnkey terrified by the former Menaces of the Chevalier was only solicitous about satisfying him without giving  himself any Trouble to calm the Fears of the Countess As the Minutes rolled away her Apprehensions increased yet still she fain would have persuaded herself that she had miscounted the Hour and this Thought left her some faint Remains of Hope which supported her fluttering Spirits till the Clock struck and she reckoned Twelve At this sad Confirmation of her Fears a mortal Paleness overspread her Face her trembling Knees could no longer support her Weight she sunk down upon a Chair and losing all Hopes of Liberty and of Life she abandoned herselfto an Excess of Despair  Amidst these Agonies more cruel than the Tortures she dreaded the Turnkey suddenly opened the Door of her Chamber and desired her to follow him his unexpected Sight had such an Effect upon the Countess that she fell fainting into the Arms of the Woman who attended her her Mind tortured at first by Suspense and afterwards sunk in the most deep Despair could not bear the overwhelming Joy which the sudden Transition from certain Death to Liberty and Safety gave her She continued a long Time deprived of Speech and Sense and in all Appearance dead  The Turnkey surprized at this Accident and dreading the fatal Consequences of it knew not what to do The Woman who was likewise a Witness of so sad a Spectacle  was so much terrified that she was for several Moments incapable of giving her any Assistance But after they had thrown some Water on her Face she gave Signs of returning Life the Turnkey repeatedly cried to her that her Friends were waiting for her That welcome Sound at length recalled her scattered Spirits she opened her Eyes and the Turnkey urging her to depart immediately lest they should be prevented Fear gave her Strength in an Instant the Woman lent her her supporting Arm while the Turnkey softly walked before with a Light with eager though trembling Stept she quitted that horrible Place When she had got without the Gate she thought herself secure and now light as the Wind her willing Feet carried her along she hardly touched the Ground and flew rather than walked to the Place where the Chevalier and his Friends were waiting for her with great Anxiety The Chevalier received her with a thousand Transports of Joy his Friend congratulated her on her recovered Liberty in Terms that shewed the highest Satisfaction they put her and the Woman who had attended her in the Prison and who never after quitted her into a Coach they had broughtwith them and giving the Turnkey the promised Reward they left him to provide for his own Safety and went after the Coach together with the four Gentlemen who had followed them in this dangerous Enterprise The Coach brought the  Countess safe to the House of the Chevalier's Friend where he had lain so long concealed and where Messieurs  de SaintSauveur  with their Ladies were expecting her and her generous Rescuers with Agitations that can better be imagined than described  The Countess eagerly entered the Room where her Relations were her Sight drew a joyful Exclamation from her Brother and Sisterinlaw who sprung to meet her her Eyes with speaking Tenderness returned their raptured Welcomes but her Feet spontaneous carried her to her Mother's Chair whose strong Emotions had rendered unable either to rise or speak Madam  de Berci  threw herself on her Knees before her and taking a Hand of each dear Parent as they sat close together she put them to her Lips in a pathetic Silence for her Heart was too full to speak The overjoyed Mother hung over her with Tears of Tenderness and Transport the no less transported Father embraced her as she kneeled and with lifted Eyes adored the gracious Providence that had restored to him his Child The young Marquis and his Lady impatient to fold their beloved Sister in their Arms stood close beside her each with Arms extended for the wished Embrace while the Chevalier and his Friend extremely affected with this tender Scene stood at some Distance contemplating it What sweet Emotions then filled the Breast of the Chevalier at seeing the Object he had so long adored so long  lamented restored by him to Liberty to Life and to the tender Gratulations of her Friends No Wonder that his Heart entertained a Hope of being one Day rewarded with the Possession of her whom he had so faithfully served  When the first Transports for this happy Meeting were a little abated and their Joy  ound vent in Words a thousand rapturous Welcomes were given the Countess a thousand Blessings pronounced on the Chevalier who had so generously exposed his Life to deliver her nor was Monsieur  la Ronvere's  Kindness unacknowledged by the whole late sorrowing now rejoicing Family The Morning appeared e'er they could be persuaded to separate but the Chevalier representing to them that it might raise some Suspicions if they were not seen as usual at their own Hotel the two Marquisses and their Ladies with extreme Reluctance returned Home and left the Countess to recruit her wasted Spirits in Slumbers more tranquil than any she had for a long Time tasted  The Countess's Escape from the Chatelet was not  o soon discovered as they had Reason to apprehend for the Jailor from the Effects of the Night's Debauch lay late in Bed and when he got up was so much disordered that for several Hours he could not as usual visit his Prisoners to see if all were safe At length however he took his  accustomed Rounds when he came to the Chamber where the Countess had been confined and found the Door open and no one within he grew pale with Fear and Amazement and dreaded to make any Enquiries lest his Apprehensions should be turned into Certainties His Wife having just then been informed that the Turnkey had not been seen in the Chatelet that Day came to acquaint her Husband with the News and was astonished to see him gazing wildly round the Lady's Chamber with all the Marks of Terror and Dismay imprinted on his Countenance  Do you know cried she pulling him by the Sleeve that the Turnkey is fled  The Jailor at these Words starting as from a Dream sent forth a Volly of Execrations and tearing his Hair roared out that he was ruined the Lady had made her escape and the wicked Turnkey it was plain had assisted her and was fled with her The Wife taking in instantly all the fatal Consequences of this Flight intreated her Husband to compose himself and to endeavour privately to discover what Way the Fugitives had taken and get them again into his Hands  It will be Time enough said she to declare their Flight when you have lost all Hopes of recovering them You will unavoidably be turned out of your Employment as soon as it is known that this Accident happened through your Intemperance therefore by keeping it  secret you will only defer your Fate a little longer if you do not succeed in your Attempts to get back your Prisoner and if you do you will have nothing to fear  The Jailor relished this Reasoning although it was very absurd for he ought immediately to have given Notice to the Officers of Justice that the Countess had escaped that she might have been immediately pursued his Wife however was willing to put off the evil Moment as long as she could This Procrastination saved the Countess as it gave her Friends Time to settle the Method of her Flight  Messieurs and the Ladies  de SaintSauveur  returned to the House of Monsieur  la Ronvere  the next Day as secretly as possible in order to consult with the Countess and her Friends upon the Measures they were to take to keep her concealed They did not doubt but her Flight from the Chatelet was already publicly known and that she would be sought for with the utmost Diligence This Thought gave them great Uneasiness such is the Vicissitude of human Passions and of Affairs below Hope and Fear Joy and Sorrow succeed each other naturally as Darkness to the Light  The Transport which the Relations of the Countess had felt for her Deliverance now gave way to their Sorrow for her Departure  which for many obvious Reasons it was absolutely necessary should be sudden While they were deliberating in great Confusion and Anxiety upon the Measures she should pursue Monsieur  la Ronvere  who had very prudently been in Search of News that Morning supposing the Town would be full of the Countess's Escape returned pleasingly surprized to tell the perplexed Family that Madam  de Berci  was either not yet missed or the Jailor for Considerations in which himself was concerned had certainly concealed her Flight that therefore they need not precipitate their Resolutions but take Time to deliberate upon the Course which was now most proper to pursue  The Countess proposed retiring to  Burgundy  where she might remain in Safety in a Castle belonging to the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  her Father the natural Strength of the Place and the great Affection all the Gentlemen in that Province bore her Family made that appear to her the securest as well as the most decent Retreat as it was not likely they would suffer any Violence to be offered to her there The old Marquis was of Opinion that to attempt to secure his Daughter by Force was an Insult to the Authority of Justice and the highest Disrespect to the Sovereign who would undoubtedly if thus braved by his Subjects make himself be obeyed in his own Kingdom in spite of all Obstacles It was then proposed by the young  Marquis that his Sister should leave  France  and till this Storm that threatened her Life and Honour was laid reside in some foreign Country  Flanders  was unanimously allowed to be the fittest Retreat for her the City of  Brussels  in particular where she had a Kinswoman with whom she could stay with Honour This Lady was Wife to the Ambassador from  France  to the Archduke and had always had a great Friendship for Madam  de Berci  It was therefore concluded that she should set out early the next Morning with an Escort able to defend her against any Attempts that might be made upon her Liberty Monsieur  la Ronvere  engaged the four Gentlemen who had assisted in carrying the Countess from the Chatelet to accompany him in guarding her to the Frontiers they were likewise to be attended by a good Number of their Servants well armed and they declared that they would not quit the Lady till they delivered her safe to the Ambassadress  The Chevalier with eager Joy seized this new Opportunity of shewing his Zeal and Ardor in the Service of his beloved Countess no Intreaties could dissuade him from attending her in this Journey and he resolved not to quit her any more till her Innocence was made manifest in the Eyes of all  France  When it was fully determined that the Countess should retire to  Brussels  and all the necessary Preparations for her Journey were made they next consulted upon the Measures to be taken in order to discover the Author of the Count's Assassination by which alone she could be cleared as well as the Chevalier upon whom the Weight of this Accusation fell The Count's Hint relating to  Marianne  the conscious Look he gave her her extreme Confusion in Consequence of it and her diabolical Malice in accusing the Countess were the Points now discussed Madam  de Berci  listened attentively to the different Opinions that were formed upon this Wretch's Behaviour some Suspicions suddenly darted into her Mind  Marianne's  scandalous Intrigue with  Verague  rushed upon her Remembrance she thought she ought not to conceal a Circumstance of such Importance from her Family however unwilling she was to discover the infamous Secret and which her Delicacy considered as a kind of Recrimination Her Friends greatly blamed her for so long suppressing a Circumstance of such a Nature and with good Reason formed violent Suspicions against  Verague  The young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  was commissioned immediately to make some Inquiries after that Gentleman he went to his House and was told that he was not at home the Marquis asked so many Questions concerning him and so artfully examined the Servant who answered him that at last he  learned that  Verague  had left  Paris  fifteen Days before and was gone to pass some time in travelling When he returned to his Friends with this Account no one doubted but that  Verague  was the real Assassin But as they could as yet prove nothing it was judged proper to keep their Suspicions secret from all but Monsieur  de Berci  who was as well as them greatly interested in revenging his Brother's Murder As he truly esteemed and loved his Sisterinlaw he was rejoiced to hear of her Escape from Prison and resolved together with the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  to go in Search of the Murderer and if possible bring him to Justice  At length the cruel Moment came that was to separate the Countess of  Berci  from her afflicted Friends they had no Leisure to indulge Tears and Embraces sudden and sad their Parting was The old Marquis his Lady and Daughterinlaw not being allowed to follow her to the Coach for fear of giving Suspicion pressed her each in their Arms and withdrew in silent Anguish at Eight o'Clock at Night She entered drowned in Tears a Coach drawn by six Horses which waited for her at a private Gate of Monsieur  la Ronvere's  House All her female Attendants were the Woman who had fled with her from the Chatelet and a young Maid that belonged to the Marchioness her Mother The Chevalier  des Essars  attended  by his Gentleman a Valet de Chambre and a  Biscayan  of whose Fidelity he was well assured mounted their Horses as did likewise Monsieur  la Ronvere  and the four Gentlemen before mentioned and followed the Coach at a small Distance they went all out of  Paris  by the Gate of  St Denis  and took the Rout through  Picardy  to  Flanders  They soon reached  Cambray  having travelled with great Speed and resting there one Day pursued their Journey but with less Haste and Fatigue as they were now out of Danger The Chevalier finding there was nothing farther to apprehend intreated Monsieur  la Ronvere  and his Friends to return to  Paris  with all possible Diligence lest if their Absence should be known they might probably be supposed to have been of their Party He as well as the Countess expressed the highest Acknowledgments for the Services they had received from him and his generous Friends It was with Difficulty that the Chevalier could prevail upon them to return till they had seen the Countess safe at  Brussels  but the Reasons he urged for their Departure being unanswerable they at length separated not without some Tears and many affectionate Wishes on both Sides  From  Cambray  to  Brussels  the Chevalier gave his Horse to his Valet to lead and seated himself by the Countess in the Coach The continual View of an Object whom he so ardently loved soon banished all Remembrance  of his past Misfortunes and left him no leisure to reflect on any of those with which he was still threatned A thousand soft Emotions filled his Breast but his Respect for the Countess whom he saw buried in a profound Sadness and the Regard he owed to the Memory of his late Friend represt the Violence of his Passion and obliged him to such a reserved and distant Behaviour as left the Countess no cause to complain of him and indeed during the whole Journey his tender Assiduity and his solicitude and Eagerness to serve her were the only indications he gave of a Flame the most pure and constant that ever warmed a Heart The Countess was too generous not to give this Moderation all the Weight it ought to have her Gratitude so much engaged already every Hour added to the Debt the tender Awe so apparent in the Chevalier's Behaviour the conscious Love that sparkled in his Eyes yet when they met hers reluctently withdrawn lest they should too plainly discover all that passed in his Heart were such Indications of uncommon Delicacy and Respect as could not fail of making a very great Impression on a Heart so generous as hers With such a mutual Reserve did these two Lovers pass the happiest Moments of their Lives the only Opportunities they ever had to declare their Sentiments to each other were Sacrificed to Delicacy and to Grief  As soon as they arrived at  Brussels  Madam  de Berci  dispatched a Messenger with a Letter to the Ambassador's Lady acquainting her with the Situation of her Affairs and the Design she had of throwing herself into her Protection that Lady no sooner received it than she ordered her Coach to be made ready and went herself to fetch her Kinswoman from the Inn she had put up at such an Instance of Respect joined to the affectionate Reception she gave the Countess made the Chevalier entertain a high Opinion of the Merit of that Lady Few Persons know how to confer Favours on the Unfortunate the highest Delicacy must accompany Acts of Benevolence to true Merit and Dignity in Affliction if we would not oppress that Heart we intend to relieve The Chevalier went that Day to pay his Respects to the ArchDuke that Prince received him in the most gracious Manner imaginable the great Actions he had performed in  France  and even in  Holland  tho' against himself inspired him with Admiration and Esteem for such extraordinary Valour He loaded him with Favours in Hopes to bring him over to his Service and offered him a very considerable Pension to engage him to fix himself in his Court but the Chevalier had too much Greatness of Mind to secure his Safety by Concessions inconsistent with the strictest Honour He intreated his Highness not to be offended with him for refusing the Offers he was pleased to make him he assured him that although he  had incurred the Displeasure of his King rather indeed by his Misfortune than his Fault yet that he was resolved to continue faithful to him till his Death but at the same Time he expressed the highest Acknowledgements to the ArchDuke for his offered Bounty and declared that he would be always ready to shed his Blood in Support of his Interests uninfluenced by any Reward when he could do so without violating the Duty he owed his lawful Sovereign  The ArchDuke was generous enough to applaud a Conduct which opposed his Desires he was charmed with his disinterested Loyalty and gave him publick Testimonies of his Esteem As the Chevalier conceived he had only performed his Duty by rejecting the ArchDuke's Offers he did not repent of what he had done although he found himself still persecuted by his Prince for  Henry  was no sooner informed that the Countess and he had retired to  Brussels  but he sent Orders to his Ambassador there to arrest them both and send them under a strong Guard to  Paris  The Ambassador's Lady greatly concerned that she could no longer protect her unfortunate Kinswoman acquainted her immediatiately with the Orders her Husband had received It was resolved she should leave  Brussels  with as much Expediton and Secresy as possible and retire to  Friesland  The Chevalier insensible to his own Misfortunes only lamented those of the Countses  She again set out under his Convoy and they arrived safely in  Friesland  where they hoped to remain for some Time in Tranquility but Fortune was not yet weary of persecuting the Countess of  Berci  her Charms had not suffered any Dimunition from the Distresses she had been in her Countenance shewed indeed that her Mind was not at ease but that soft Languor with which it was overspread carried a secret Influence that no Heart could resist No one could behold her without feeling pity for her Sorrows whatever they were and Pity for so lovely an Object soon ripened into a more tender Passion it was thus that a Nobleman of  Friesland  found himself captivated with the melancholly Fair One before he was aware but presuming upon his Rank and Fortune he was at no Pains to desguise his Passion the Chevalier  des Essars  had perceived it before he himself could give a Name to his Sentiments Nothing is so quick sighted as the Eyes of a Lover all his Confidence in the Justice and Generosity of Madam  de Berci  could not hinder him from feeling the most cruel Torments at the Thoughts of this new Conquest but dreading to offend her by a Jealousy so injurious to that perfect Esteem she exprest for him he imposed Silence upon his Tongue and had it been possible would have regulated his Looks in such a Manner that they should not have given the least Indication of the torturing Anguish that preyed upon his Soul  The Countess was not long before she discovered the painful Situation of her Lover The Restraint he laid upon himself in not disclosing the Cause of it to her was a new Proof of his Respect which claimed some Return She was resolved not to let him languish any longer under such cruel Enquietude and was therefore the first to propose leaving  Friesland  she alledged that the Air of that Province did not agree with her constitution and she desired he would conduct her as soon as possible to some Place where her Health might be less endangered The Chevalier who did not penetrate into the Countess's secret Reasons for being desirous to leave  Friesland  was excessively rejoyced that a Proposal so agreeable to his Wishes had first come from herself he would have been wretched had he imagined she had perceived his Jealousy for although in Lovers it may be considered as a Proof of the Violence of their Passion yet in a favoured one it argues some injurious Distrust of his Mistress which a Woman of any Delicacy cannot easily prevail upon herself to pardon The Chevalier therefore wisely concealing the particular Interest he had in the Countess's leaving  Friesland  replied calmly that he would attend her when ever she pleased and advised her to make  Gascony  the Place of her Retreat he assured her that in that Province there were several strong Castles at so great a Distance from the Court that they need not be under any Apprehensions of being surprized although it  should be discovered that they were there he added that by being nearer their Friends and Estates they might avoid many Inconveniencies to which they were now subjected in that Country  The Countess approved of his Advice but being resolved to take no Step of that Kind without first consulting her Father she told the Chevalier that they must defer their Departure till she had wrote to the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  and received his Answer It was not long before the Answer they waited for arrived it filled the Countess of  Berci  with Joy but it was not favourable to the Wishes of the poor Chevalier as he found he should for a long Time be deprived of the Presence of her who was dearer to him than any other Person in the World  The old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  informed his Daughter that the Count of  Berci  for so we must now call her Brotherinlaw had left  Paris  together with the Marquis his Son to go in search of  Verague  that he himself was preparing to go to Court to solicit a Pardon for the Chevalier  des Essars  on Account of his Duel with the Count of  Polan  that he would engage so many Persons of Distinction in his  se and use such Methods as he hoped would entirely undeceive the grand Monarque who had suffered himself to be influenced by his Regard for the Favourite to the Prejudice of the Chevalier  When his  Pardon for the Death of the Count of  Polan  is obtained added the old Marquis he will then be at Liberty to come and defend his Innocence with Regard to the Accusation he suffers under as well as you but till this is effected I desire you will set out immediately to attend the Marchioness your Mother who will not be able in the Grief she is in for your Absence to support the additional Weight of mine  He then advised his Daughter to take her Rout through  Germany  and  Franche Comte  from whence she might travel to  Burgundy  with less Danger of a Discovery and concluded with the most affectionate Prayers for her Health and Safety  The Chevalier was greatly afflicted at this unexpected Order he had been used for some Time past to the Sight of his dear Countess almost every Day the Idea of a long Absence plunged him into the most cruel Despair yet he resolved to make a generous Effort upon himself and give Madam  de Berci  a new Proof of his Love by obeying without murmuring the Commands of her Father The Agonies it cost him to make this Resolution were but too visible in his Countenance and Behaviour the tender Sorrow that languished in his Eyes his painfully suppressed Sighs the Solitude he now courted to indulge a Melancholly which even in her presence seemed wholly to engross him could not escape the Notice of Madam  de Berci  and  filled her with sympathising Grief So perfect a Resignation to her Father's Will such a boundless Respect for hers even to the Loss of all his Happiness touched the Heart of the Countess more than the most pathetick Complaints could have done she resolved to neglect nothing which depended meerly upon herself to calm his Griefs and to enable him to support her Absence After enumerating to him all the Obligations he had conferred upon her Family and herself she assured him that her Gratitude being so much engaged by his Services her Heart had readily received the tender Impression a Passion so pure and disinterested had inspired Here she stoped abruptly when the Chevalier in a Transport of Joy threw himself upon his Knees and besought her to have Compassion upon the miserable Condition to which he should be reduced if she suffered him to leave her without giving him her Hand  Let me have the unspeakable Happiness Madam cried he to call you mine before this cruel Parting How shall I support your Absence if any Possibility remains of losing you if the Torments I have so long endured while I languished with a hopeless Passion have any Claim to your Pity if my Fidelity has any Title to reward Oh soften the Pangs of Separation by consenting to be mine  Madam  de Berci  was greatly affected with this passionate Supplication but she would not leave her Lover a Moment in Suspence upon a Point  whereon she herself was so absolutely determined her Tenderness for a Man so worthy of her utmost Esteem had at all Times yielded to her Duty nor would she suffer it now to triumph over the care of her Reputation after obliging him to rise she represented to him with her usual Sweetness that a Marriage solemnised in a foreign Country while they were accused of the Assassination of her deceased Lord would cover them both with Infamy that the Duty and Respect she owed her Parents required that her Choice should have the Sanction of their Consent and her Reputation was too dear to her to suffer her to think of Mariage till her Innocence was as well known to the World as it was to her own Heart she assured him that when they had triumphed over the Malice of their Accusers and that they were fully justified in the sight of all  France  she would follow the Impulse of her Gratitude and Tenderness that Absence should never weaken her Regard for him or blot him for one Moment out of her Remembrance and that if the Malice of their Fate should make it impossible for her to be his she never would be anothers  The Chevalier yieled to the Force of her Reasons and with the most tender Transports received the Assurances she was pleased to give him of being only his Again at her feet he vowed eternal Constancy Madam  de Berci  could not hide her Emotion when with a respectful  Awe he took her Hand and sealed his Vows upon it with his Lips while a struggling Sigh seemed to rend that manly Heart which was the Seat of every Virtue and Tears of mingled Grief and Tenderness gushed from his Eyes she hastily withdrew her Hand but not till by an almost imperceptible Pressure of his she shewed she was not offended at the Favour he had snatched and retiring to her own Apartment indulged the sweetly painful Emotions of her Soul in Tears that she had hitherto with Difficulty restrained  The Preparations for their Journey being made with the utmost Privacy and Expedition the Countess and the Chevalier set out very early in the Morning in a Coach escorted by their Servants well mounted and armed one of whom led a Horse for the Chevalier to make use of upon Occasion They continued their Rout two Days without Interruption but on the Third the Chevalier's Gentleman came up to the Coach and told him that they were pursued by six Horsemen who would infallibly be up with them in a few Minutes The Chevalier instantly leaped out of the Coach and mounted his Horse leaving Madam  de Berci  almost fainting with her Fears it was in vain that he protested to her he would lose his Life rather than suffer her to fall under the Power of her Enemies so sad an Alternative only increased her Grief with Eyes and Hands lifted up she earnestly implored the Assistance of Heaven  and collecting all her Fortitude to her Aid silently waited the Issue of this Adventure The Chevalier had ordered the Coach to go on while he with his Gentlemen his faithful  Biscayan  and two Gentlemen of  Friesland  waited undauntedly for the Enemy As soon as they came near the Chevalier knew the foremost to be the  German  Nobleman who was in Love with the Countess the Sight of his Rival added to his natural Courage all the Fury that Hate and Jealousy could inspire The  German  was for pursuing the Coach but the Chevalier rushing in his Way bid him proceed upon his Peril and asked him with what Intention he followed that Coach The  German  with horrid Oaths replied that he would have the Lady The Chevalier made no other Answer than by firing his Pistol at his Rival but missing his Aim the  German  and his Men fired upon the Chevalier and his Attendants and at this first Discharge his Gentleman and the two  Frieslanders  fell to the Ground The Chevalier transported with Rage at this Sight clapping Spurs to his Horse rushed through the midst of his Enemies and coming up close to the  German  shot him through the Head He then drew his Sword and being seconded by his faithful  Biscayan  he overturned all that opposed him the  Germans  dismayed at the Death of their Master and the Impetuosity of the Chevalier  who had made two of their Companions bite the Ground turned their Horses Heads and fled with the utmost Precipitation while the Chevalier and his Servant galloped after the Coach and never stopped till they had passed the Frontiers of  Friesland  The Chevalier had received some slight Wounds but those of his faithful  Biscayan  were much more dangerous The Ian they alighted at being at a great Distance from any Town there was no Surgeon to be had and the Chevalier was obliged to dress his own Wounds and his Servant's as well as he could Madam  de Berci  was greatly alarmed for her Lover but he assured her that he felt so little Inconveniency from his Hurts that he was able to attend her as soon as the Horses had baited The  Biscayan  indeed was obliged to be put to Bed he was dangerously wounded in the Shoulder The Chevalier desired a Surgeon might be sent for with the utmost Expedition and leaving him Money to defray all his Expences ordered him as soon as he was cured to join him in  Gascony  Madam  de Berci  and the Chevalier after taking a little Refreshment again entered the Coach the Countess gave some Tears to the Memory of the Chevalier's Gentleman for whose Loss his Master expressed great Concern They met with no Accident the remaining  Part of their Journey and arrived happily in  Franche Comte  The Countess at her Lover's earnest Intreaty resided eight Days at  Besançon  and then resumed their Rout to  Burgundy  The Marquis  de SaintSauveur's  Castle was but two Days Journey from  Auxerre  the Chevalier's Heart was divided between Grief and Joy when he surrendered the Countess to the Arms of her indulgent Mother who received her with inexpressible Transports That she was now in Security was a Circumstance which could not but give him the highest Satisfaction but when he considered that he must soon leave her that it might be long e'er he beheld her again he suffered Torments which can only be imagined by those who have loved like him and like him been torn from the Object of their Affections The old Marchioness releasing her Daughter from her Embraces turned towards the Chevalier and in Terms that expressed the highest Gratitude thanked him for her Safety she told him that the Marquis had eight Days ago set out for  Paris  on the Business he had mentioned to the Countess in the Letter he had wrote to her and that he would send him Notice in  Gascony  what Success he had at Court It was necessary for this Reason as well as for his own Security that the Chevalier should go into that Province immediately He had an Uncle there who was very much advanced in Years and to whose vast Possessions he was Heir  who earnestly desired to see him as he found he must leave the Countess he resolved to rush at once into his Misery and after resting one Night at the Castle  de SaintSauveur  he took Leave of the Marchioness and Madam  de Berci  and pursued his Way to  Gascony  The Marchioness who saw her Daughter swallowed up in Affliction omitted nothing which maternal Fondness could suggest to comfort her but as her Consolations were wholly applied to the Misfortunes she had lately suffered on account of the vile Accusation she had laboured under she did not reach the Bottom of the Countess's Grief who was pierced to the Heart by the Despair that was visible in her Lover's Eyes notwithstanding his assumed Composure at parting  The Chevalier full of uneasy Thoughts that made him wholly regardless of his Safety took  Paris  in his Way to  Gascony  he was very desirous of seeing his Friends there and arriving at  Charenton  at Five o'Clock in the Evening of the third Day after his Departure from the Castle  de SaintSauveur  he rode slowly on not being willing to enter  Paris  till it was dark A Noise of some Horses behind him made him apprehensive that he was discovered and pursued he turned hastily to see who they were that were riding after him and perceived four Archers of the Provost conducting a Prisoner whose Legs were fastened  under his Horse's Belly Although the Chevalier had but a slight View of this Prisoner yet he imagined he knew the Face he rode up to the Archers and desired to know who their Prisoner was and whither they were conducting him  We are carrying him replied one of them to the little Chatelet where he was formerly Turnkey but we should have enough to do added he in a surly Tone if we answered all the impertinent Questions that are asked us  The Chevalier without heeding the Fellows Rudeness was reflecting upon the Misfortune of the poor Turnkey and upon the Means he should use to deliver him Gratitude as well as Compassion suggested to him that he ought not to let this poor Wretch suffer for an Action which he had drawn him in to commit and of which the Countess and himself had all the Benefit he therefore again accosted the Archers and with great Mildness represented to them that the unhappy Man would certainly be hanged if they carried him to Prison  and you said he will then be concerned at the Part you have had in precipitating his Death if you will deliver him to me I will give you twenty Pistoles to drink and you will bind the poor Wretch to pray for you as long as he lives  We neither care for his Prayers nor your Pistoles said one of them who had  not yet spoke and possibly it would be better for you if you were less charitable than you are  How replied the Chevalier a little alarmed do you intend to make me Prisoner for being too charitable  I do not say so replied the Archer but if those by whom we are commissioned to bring this Man Prisoner to  Paris  were to know your Offers they would force you to declare what Interest you have in his Escape from Justice  Leave that Care  to Justice returned the Chevalier who began to be enraged and at present think of nothing but delivering this Man to me for I will absolutely have him I desire you will unbind him this Instant and resign him into my Hands for nothing since you have refused my Money and if you do not comply willingly know that I will have him from you by Force  The Archers stared upon one another in Astonishment at this arrogant Speech they thought the Chevalier was a Madman and were more inclined to laugh at his Extravagance than dispute with him for their Prisoner but when they saw him fall upon them Sword in Hand assisted by his Valet de Chambre and a Lackey he had brought from  Burgundy  they prepared in good earnest for a vigorous Defence The Chevalier dealt his Strokes with such Rapidity and Success among the Archers that two fell immediately to the Ground his Servants dispatched another and  the fourth fled towards  Vincennes  leaving the poor trembling Prisoner in the Hands of his Deliverer for whom during the Combat he had offered up the most ardent Prayers The Chevalier ordered his Valet to take off his Irons and then making himself known he congratulated him upon his Freedom the Turnkey ravished with Joy and Gratitude fell at his Feet and vowed the Life he had preserved should from thenceforwards be wholly at his Disposal  They now rode with all Speed towards  Paris  the Chevalier altered his Intention of stopping there on account of his Adventure with the Archers and continued his Journey to  Estampes  whither he arrived at the Break of Day he rested about two Hours and then taking Post with the Turnkey who never afterwards quitted him he arrived safe at his Uncles Estate which was a few Days Journey from  Bordeaux  The old Man who had not seen him during ten Years before received him with Transports that had like to have been fatal to his Health He wept at the Recital of the several Dangers and Misfortunes which had happened to him in the Course of so many Years and earnestly conjured him to expose himself no more to the Caprice of Fortune but to live with him in Security and Happiness  The News of the Chevalier's Arrival being spread over the Province all the neighbouring  Gentry came in Crouds to visit him and to shew their Joy for his Return he had the Satisfaction a few Days afterwards to see again his faithful  Biscayer  who was perfectly recovered of his Wounds The Tenderness his Uncle expressed for him and the obliging Solicitude of his Friends to divert and please him suspended for some Time the Agonies of a Passion which had hitherto been traversed by so many cruel Accidents But we shall now leave him to enjoy a shortlived Repose and see what Success the old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  had at Court  His Impatience to serve the Chevalier  des Essars  would not permit him to delay going to the  Louvre  the Day after his Arrival to solicit the King in his favour he extolled in Terms worthy of the Fervor of his Friendship the Valour and Generosity of the Chevalier of which on many different Occasions he had given the most shining Proofs He dwelt upon his unshaken Fidelity when distressed and a Fugitive in the Court of the Archduke persecuted by the Laws and under the Displeasure of his Sovereign he had refused a very considerable Pension and disclaimed his Protection if he must purchase it by the smallest Violation of his Duty The Marquis then throwing himself at the King's Feet modestly reminded him of his past Services and with Tears conjured him to have Compassion on his old faithful Soldier sinking under the Weight of Years and Infirmities  and made miserable by the Assassination of a worthy Soninlaw and the undeserved Sufferings of his Daughter  To soften these Calamities said the good old Man grant me I conjure your Majesty the Pardon of the Chevalier  des Essars  for unfortunately killing the Count of  Polan  in a Duel which he could not in Honour or Justice avoid after the Attempt that was made upon his Person by a Kinsman of the Count and by his Orders  He then represented to the King that the Count in his Answer to the Chevalier's Challenge had in a manner confessed the Charge and therefore justly deserved the Fate he had met with  The Circumstances of the Chevalier's Combat with the Count of  Polan  had by his Friends been represented to the King in a manner very different from the Truth prejudiced by those Reports and the Tenderness he had borne to the Deceased he answered the Marquis with some little Indignation  That he had been prevailed upon to pardon Duellists when their Quarrel had been fairly decided by the Sword but that he had never skreened Assassins from Justice  and expressed a great Astonishment that the Marquis should so earnestly implore Pardon for a Man who had been accused of murdering his Soninlaw  I do not Sire replied the Marquis implore your Pardon for an Assassin but for a Man who has bravely killed his Enemy in a fair Fight no if it can be proved that the Chevalier  des Essars  has murdered my Soninlaw I would be the first to intreat that he might suffer the Punishment due to such a Crime but being fully persuaded of his Innocence with regard to my Son's Assassination I am come to solicit his Pardon for a lesser Offence in order that he may be at Liberty to clear himself of a greater  Marquis answered the King the Relations of the Count of  Polan  are convinced that the Chevalier killed that Nobleman basely although they possibly do not believe him guilty of your Soninlaw's Murder Thus every one listens to the Dictates of his own private Resentment for supposed Wrongs but I who am not a Party but a Judge in this Cause will render to each the Justice that is due to him  Permit me Sire returned the old Man to represent to your Majesty that no one is condemned till he has been heard in his own Defence I am solicitous to procure the Chevalier's Pardon for the Count of  Polan's  Death that he may clear himself of my Son's Murder My Daughter's Character labours under the same odious Calumny her Justification is included in  that of the Chevalier In this Case the Accused and the Accusers are in a like Uncertainty Surmises only can be opposed to Surmises but if your Majesty will on this Occasion follow the Example of some of your glorious Predecessors when in Capital Crimes there was neither sufficient Evidence to condemn or to acquit and allow the Parties to decide their Cause by the Sword Providence and a just Cause will I doubt not enable the Chevalier to make good his Challenge let who will be the Opposer  The King was at Dinner while the Marquis with friendly Zeal and honest Eloquence was pleading the Chevalier's Cause Among other Noblemen who attended at his Majesty's Chair was the young Count of  Polan  Brother to him whom the Chevalier had killed This young Lord had already acquired a great Reputation for personal Valour the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  had scarce finished his Speech when he threw himself at the King's Feet and conjured him not to let the Death of a Brother so dear to him and who had been killed by the Chevalier contrary to the known Rules of Duelling go unrevenged for want of sufficient Proofs but permit him to challenge the Chevalier to single Combat  Count interrupted the old Marquis were it not that we are in the Presence of the  greatest King in the World to whom I owe an inviolable Respect I would not tamely suffer you to charge the Chevalier  des Essars  with having basely killed your Brother he is too noble and too generous to commit any dishonourable Action and too brave to have Recourse to Assassination to rid him of an Enemy or unjustifiable Methods to overcome him Loaden as I am with Years and Afflictions this Arm wants not Strength nor this Heart Courage to defend the Chevalier against so base an Accusation and if his Majesty will permit it I am ready whenever you please to prove with my Sword that what you have asserted against my Friend is false I would rather replied the young Count of  Polan  with a scornful Smile meet your Son than you upon this Occasion but when I have done with you I will support the Truth of what I have said against your Son and against the Chevalier  des Essars  likewise if he dares accept my Challenge  The good old Marquis enraged at this Insolence was going to reply with some Warmth when the King imposed Silence upon them both and forbid them upon Pain of his highest Indignation to proceed any further in this Affair Afterwards that Prince feeling the Force of those Arguments the old Marquis urged in favour of the Chevalier as well as the Duty and Fidelity he had shewn in refusing a Pension from the Archduke at a  Time when his Protection was so necessary for his Safety he granted him a Pardon for the Death of the Count of  Polan  upon Condition that he returned to  Paris  within a Month to clear himself of the Assassination of the Count of  Berci  The old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  transported with Joy that he had thus happily carried his Point returned to  Burgundy  with great Expedition where he had the Satisfaction to find his Daughter already arrived being informed by her of the particular Place where the Chevalier resided he sent a Gentleman post that very Day with his Pardon which he accompanied with the following Letter  I have at length Monsieur had the good Fortune to touch the Heart of the most just and benevolent of King's by the Representations I have made in your favour The Bearer of this will deliver your Pardon for your last Duel in Form There is now nothing to hinder you from appearing to clear your Innocence with respect to the lamented Murder of my dear Soninlaw and to cover with Confusion and Disgrace those who have blackened your Fame and that of my Daughter I am not through paternal Tenderness more solicitous for her Justification than through Gratitude and Friendship for yours I would have sent my Son to you with this News if I had  found him after my Return from Court at my Castle but he is still abroad in Search of  Verague  I make it my constant Prayer to Heaven that he may be so fortunate as to bring back that Wretch with him to  France  Do not fail to be at  Paris  within the Time prescribed to you by the King and may our meeting be happy to us all  The Marquis having communicated this Letter to his Lady she told him that her Daughter being so much concerned in this Affair it was proper that she also should write to the Chevalier the Marquis approved of the Proposal and desired Madam  de Berci  to write to their common Friend which she did with great Willingness in these Terms  I write to you Monsieur by the Command of my Parents but at the same time I must assure you that no Command of theirs was ever more chearfully complied with You will understand by my Father's Letter which accompanies this what he has done for you at Court and what is now expected from you for your own Justification as well as mine I do not think it necessary to press your speedy Return to  Paris  wherever your Honour and my Interest is concerned I cannot doubt of your utmost Solicitude Be assured that my Desire to see you again is not one of my least Motives for being anxious for your Return The many and great Obligations  I owe you merit all my Gratitude and my tenderest Esteem may my Justification be also your Work that my Heart may openly avow the Sentiments with which you have inspired it Adieu  The Messenger having received these Dispatches and proper Instructions where to find the Chevalier  des Essars  in  Gascony  set out for that Province immediately His Return was expected with extreme Impatience by the Countess of  Berci  but an unfortunate Accident happened which produced great Disorders in the Chevalier's Affairs the Messenger was sent in a Season of the Year when the Waters had rose very high and travelling was both dangerous and tedious as he was riding along the Side of a little River which had overflowed great Part of the Road he perceived that the Postillion was got beyond his Depth and was in Danger of being lost together with his Horse eager to save the Youth he advanced hastily to lay hold of him by the Neck but the Bank upon which he supported himself suddenly gave way and his Horse stumbling he fell into the Water and both he and his Postilion were drowned By this fatal Accident the Chevalier was prevented from appearing at Court within the Time prescribed which brought on the Countess of  Berci  and himself many cruel Misfortunes but let us now see how the Chevalier employed himself in his Retirement where he was perfectly ignorant of all that had passed at Court  The old Marquis  des Essars  his Uncle who was extremely rich and had no other Heir but the Chevalier was laying Schemes in his own Mind to fix him in  Gascony  for the rest of his Life he dreaded his Return to Court lest some new Misfortune should deprive him for ever of a Nephew he so tenderly loved and whose Presence was so necessary to his Happiness He resolved therefore to make his Connexions in  Gascony  so strong that it should not be in his Power to break them and this was only to be done by marrying him advantagiously Mademoiselle  de Genvincourt  was the Lady he pitched upon for a Wife for the Chevalier she was young beautiful and had the greatest Fortune in the Province she had been left an Orphan in her earliest Years under the Guardianship of a Kinsman of her Father who for some Time very faithfully discharged his Trust he carefully applied himself to improve the great Qualities she had received from Nature by an excellent Education the surprizing Progress she made in every Kind of Learning and the consummate Loveliness of her Person excited an Admiration of her in the Heart of her Guardian which when she grew older terminated in a most violent Passion his advanced Age his Proximity of Blood his low Fortunes low when compared to hers were Considerations too weak to hinder him from declaring his Sentiments to his ward and to solicit earnestly for her Hand Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  with a Mind as haughty as ever Woman's  was had all the Courage Fortitude and Resolution of the most intrepid Man Her Inclinations from her earliest Youth had led her to Masculine Exercises and the Make of her Person beautiful and finely proportioned as it was fitted her for exelling in them She was so enraged at her Guardians presumptuous Declaration that she would have wished to chastise his Insolence with her own Arm for her Resentments were no more feminine than her Spirit With a Look of inconceivable Disdain she desired him to be silent for ever upon such a Subject if he did not wish to feel the Effects of her just Indignation  The poor Guardian was thunderstruck at a Repulse couched in Terms so very extraordinary for a Lady yet he did not cease to persecute her with his Addresses which so provoked the haughty Girl that she resolved to set him at Defiance Some little Time afterwards he was obliged to go into another part of the Province upon Affairs which would necessarily detain him several Weeks Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  took this Opportunity to fortify the Castle in which she had hitherto lived with her Kinsman and shut herself up in it with some of her Friends when her Guardian returned she refused him Admittance and ordered him to be gone otherwise she would Fire upon him and his Attendants from the Windows the old Lover retired in Despair and soon after died with  meer Shame and Grief for the Treatment he had received from his Charge this Affair made a great Noise over all the Province every one was pleased with the Spirit and Resolution of Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  her fine Accomplishments the Charms of her Person her noble Birth and her great Riches brought an innumerable Croud of Lovers to her Feet but there was not one amongst them who in her Opinion was worthy of her Heart  It was this incomparable young Lady whom the old Marquis  des Essars  designed should give Fetters to his Nephew He was not ignorant of her extreme Haughtiness and her declared Aversion to Marriage founded upon her own Fondness for Liberty and desire of Rule but he hoped every thing from the extraordinary Merit of his Nephew whose Fame too vast for his Country had extended itself over all Europe and made him the Object of Universal Admiration and Esteem he flattered himself that Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  would be charmed with a Character that so nearly resembled her own but he did not think it proper to mention his Design to his Nephew the Sight of Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  he justly thought would have more Influence upon his Heart than all his Arguments or even his Authority if he was inclined to make use of it not but he was acquainted with the Chevalier's Passion for the Countess of  Berci  and looked on it as an Obstacle to the Success of his Scheme he  was too prudent to think of reasoning him out of his Love for that Lady but he expected a great deal from the Beauty of Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  and therefore earnestly wished that Chance might throw her in his Way not doubting but the Sight of so many Charms informed by a Mind great and noble as his own would have suitable Effects upon a Heart whose Sensibility was but too certain  The old Marquis having been taken up several Days in contriving Schemes to bring his Nephew and Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  together at last bethought himself of making a Party for the Chace which could not fail of answering his Purpose When this Thought had once entered his Head he wondered how he could be so long before he hit upon it he went himself to invite the fair Amazon for so she was called all over  Gascony  to honour this Hunting Match with her Presence Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  instantly complied with his Invitation she had a great Desire to see the Chevalier  des Essars  of whom she had heard the most extravagant Encomiums she took a more then ordinary Care that Day in setting off her lovely Person to the greatest Advantage her Pride would not suffer her to acknowledge to herself that she had any Design upon the Chevalier's Heart yet she could not help thinking such a glorious Conquest would add greatly to the Reputation of her Charms and she neglected no Ornament  her hunting Dress would admit of to make herself appear lovely in his Eyes Her Habit was green Velvet richly embroidered with Silver a Dagger the Handle of which was adorned with a great number of Diamonds hung in a rich Scarf by her Side her fair Hair played in careless Ringlets down her Shoulders she wore a little Hat with a black Feather that waved over part of a Forehead whiter than Ivory it was adorned with Brilliants which bright as they were yielded in Lustre to her large blue Eyes in which Vivacity and Sweetness were so happily blended that the coldest Heart must have been inflamed by their piercing Rays her Horse was a Spanish Genet white as the falling Snow which she managed with a Grace wholly inchanting in this Equipage so well suited to the lovely Fierceness of her Air and Mein she rode to meet the Marquis  des Essars  and his Company The Chevalier although plainly drest had a natural Dignity in his Person which Negligence of Apparel could neither hide or diminish he was mounted upon a very fine Horse which he managed with equal Skill and Gracefulness the manly Sweetness of his Countenance the Fire that sparkled in his Eyes his martial Air soon discovered him to Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  who had been at the place appointed for meeting a few Moments before the Marquis  des Essars  and his Company  The Chevalier gazed with Astonishment and Delight upon an Object so new and charming Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  was not less struck with the noble Aspect of our Hero The Company in whispers declared that they were the lovliest Pair in the World and seemed wholly formed for each other the old Marquis enjoyed the mutual Admiration with which his Nephew and the charming Amazon beheld each other but the Effects of this Interview were vastly different in each Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  lost in a Moment that Insensibility of which she had hitherto boasted and became passionately enamoured of the Chevalier while her Beauty Inchanting as it realy was found his Heart so filled with the Idea of the Countess of  Berci  that it excited no other Sentiments for her than those of Admiration and Respect The Chevalier eagerly leaping off his Horse was presented by the Marquis his Uncle to the lovely Maid who lightly dismounting advanced to meet him The Chevalier made her a gallant Compliment which sent new Arrows to her Heart Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  found a secret Charm in every Thing he said and did she scarce ever removed her Eyes from his Face superior to the little Affectations and Reserve of her Sex she was not solicitous to conceal the favourable Sentiments she entertained for him they never separated during the Chace The old Marquis  des Essars  could hardly contain his Joy at a Success so much beyond his Hopes he did not doubt  but the Wit and Learning of Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  would finish what her Beauty had begun and entirely erase all Remembrance of the Countess of  Berci  The Chevalier indeed found Graces in the Conversation of Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  which greatly increased his Admiration and Esteem of her A Man of his Galantry and Vivacity could hardly avoid talking of Love to so charming a Creature whom he had an Opportunity of entertaining alone he fell naturally into very passionate Expressions by which however he meant nothing more than to pay that Homage he thought due to a Beauty so attracting and a Wit so lively and poignant Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  had been too much used to make such sudden Conquests to doubt that her Charms had produced their ordinary Effects she listened with Pleasure to the rapturous Language that fell from the Lips of the Chevalier and although her Heart was sensible of Emotions it had till then been a Stranger to yet she answered him with such easy Raillery and a Gaiety so unaffected that whatever were her Thoughts they remained perfectly hid from the Chevalier  The Chace finished with the taking of a large Stag and the Company being now very much fatigued they were preparing to return home when a furious Boar rushed out of a Wood that was near them and dispersed both the Hunters and the Dogs in an Instant the intrepid Chevalier alone disdained not to fly he threw himself off his Horse and advancing  towards the Boar with his drawn Sword in his Hand he thrust it up to the Hilt in the Body of the terrible Beast the Wound was mortal but the furious Animal in his dying Agonies sprung forwards and overthrowing the Chevalier fell down dead a few Paces distant from him The Marquis supposing his Nephew mortally hurt sent forth loud Cries of Grief and Consternation he was hastening to his Assistance when the fair fierce Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt  leaping off her Horse flew to raise him from the Ground trembling between Hope and Fear and all the Marks of Terror and Grief printed upon her lovely Face The Chevalier was already upon his Feet when the charming Amazon offered her assisting Hand The Marquis was by this Time come up to them as well as the rest of the Hunters their Fears were now turned to Joy and Exultation they congratulated the Chevalier upon the Victory he had gained Mademoiselle  de Gevincourt's  Emotions had been so visible that there was not one in the Company who doubted of her Love to the Chevalier she complimented him as well as the rest on his Valour but the Changes in her fair Face while she was speaking made it evident that the Danger he had so lately escaped was still most in her Thoughts The Chevalier in Imitation of  Melcager  cut off the Head of the Boar and laid it at the Feet of this fairer  Atalanta  as a Trophy consecrated to her Beauty She accepted it smileing together with the Chevalier's Offer to  attend her to her Castle where at parting he begged Permission to visit her which he obtained without Difficulty but he returned to his Uncle more pleased than captivated with the Perfections of the lovely Amazon  Mean time the Marquis  de SaintSauveur  was full of uneasy Apprehensions on hearing no News of the Chevalier the Term prescribed by the King for his Appearance for which he had engaged was almost expired he was amazed that the Messenger whom he had sent to the Chevalier did not return he knew not what to think of a Delay so unaccountable The Countess of  Berci  was in Despair nothing but the most fatal Accident could in her Opinion be the Cause of his not appearing Anxiety and Suspense might have suggested Doubts of his Love but his Honour was too well known to admit of the slightest Suspicion against it But fearful of her Parents Observations she smothered her Griefs in her own Breast and only silently deplored the various Misfortunes to which her Life was exposed  Two Days before the Expiration of the Month prescribed to the Chevalier the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  arrived at  Paris  he had spent several Months in Search of  Verague  but to no Purpose and eager to see again his beloved Wife he came back some Weeks sooner than the Time on which he had agreed to meet the Count of  Berci  at  Paris  who had been employed in the same fruitless Search On his Arrival he was immediately informed of the Challenge given by the young Count of  Polan  to his Father and to himself in the King's Presence which at the Command of his Majesty was not accepted The Fire of Youth and eager Desire of supporting his Father's Honour upon this Occasion as well as his own would not suffer him to reflect upon the Consequences of disobeying the King he sent a Challenge to the Count of  Polan  who accepted it with Joy they met accordingly and a vigorous Combat ensued both gave Proofs of great Courage and Skill and both were so much wounded that their Attendants were obliged to get Litters to carry them from the Place of Battle to  Paris  The Friends of the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  did not think him in Safety in that City therefore wounded as he was carried him in the Night to  Champiegny  to a House that belonged to one of them The young Marchioness his Wife almost dying with her Fears hastened thither to attend him the Marquis who was now capable of serious Reflexions asked her Pardon for exposing unnecessarily a Life that was dear to her while she mingling Tears with her soft Reproaches assured him that her Fate was involed in his The old Marquis his Father losing all Expectations of seeing the Chevalier resolved to be at  Paris  on the appointed Day to fight with the Count of  Polan  in behalf of his Friend unaccountable  as the Conduct of that Friend now seemed to him On his Arrival he was informed that his Son had been beforehand with him and that he was dangerously wounded as well as his Antagonist The brave old Man was piqued at his Son's Forwardness in snatching this Combat out of his Hands it looked as if he thought him unequal to the Task and he was apprehensive that it might be imagined his Son had by his Command met the Count of  Polan  in his stead These Considerations although they excited some Resentment in the brave old Soldier yet could not obliterate the Tenderness of the Father he sent Notice of his Son's Condition to the Marchioness his Wife and set out immediately himself for  Champiegny  to visit him Nothing passed at this Interview but kind Endearments on one Side and submissive Pleadings for Pardon on the other The young Marquis grew better every Day and when Madam  de SaintSauveur  his Mother and the Countess of  Berci  his Sister arrived they had the Satisfaction to find him out of Danger Their Apprehensions and Grief were now changed to Joy the young Marquis's Recovery left them nothing to wish for but the Sight of the Chevalier  des Essars  and the Discovery of  Verague  to make them entirely happy The Friends of the Count of  Polan  seeing that both he and his brave Antagonist were quite out of Danger resolved to reconcile them to each other they flattered themselves with being able to effect this the more  easily as neither of them had any Advantage over the other and their Quarrel was occasioned rather by a Point of Honour than any Injury given or received The Count of  Polan  and the young Marquis  de SaintSauveur  had a mutual Admiration of each other's Valour there is a secret Sympathy in brave and generous Minds which insensibly produces Esteem and Kindness The Count of  Polan  readily embraced an Opportunity of visiting the Marquis with a common Friend of them both and met with a most polite Reception from the Father and the Son The two Marchionesses and the Countess of  Berci  were present at this Interview which proved fatal to the Liberty of the Count of  Polan  for the Charms of Madam  de Berci  made so absolute a Conquest of his Heart that from a mortal Enemy of her Family he now became one of the most zealous Friends to it  The Count was young handsome and extremely gallant he had indeed more Vivacity than Wit but he possessed the happy Art of saying the most common Things in a manner so agreeable that his Conversation by the Ladies especially was always thought pleasing Madam  de Berci's  Heart was too little at Ease to take any Delight in the agreeable Livelinesses of this young Nobleman who knowing his own Talent took every Opportunity to display those happy Spirits which inspired good Humour and Chearfulness wherever he came The fixed Melancholy that appeared  in the Countenance and Behaviour of Madam  de Berci  repressed his Gaiety which however was no Advantage to him a true Lover insensibly adopts the prevailing Humour of his Mistress be it what it will The Count of  Polan  made no Figure in a serious Conversation nor were his Features adapted to Gravity yet his Eyes seemed to take Lessons from the lovely ones of Madam  de Berci  he sighed when she did sympathetically and Sorrow in her sweet Face had such powerful Influence upon his Heart that losing all that Fire and Vivacity which so particularly distinguished him he became pensive and reserved without knowing that he was so He easily found a Pretence for staying at  Champiegny  a few Days during which he lost no Opportunity of seeing the Countess of  Berci  but these frequent Interviews increased his Flame without affording him any Hope of his ever being more happy He saw her so wholly engrossed by Grief that he durst not make any Declaration of his Sentiments he only intreated her to accept of his Services on every Occasion that offered to defend her Innocence but he made this Request with a Zeal so animated with such apparent Tenderness in his Voice and Eyes that the Countess who knew too much of the Passion of Love herself to mistake the Cause of such extraordinary Emotions easily perceived the Impression she had made in his Heart which considering him as an Enemy to the Chevalier  des Essars  rather increased than lessened her Disgust  The Count of  Polan  returned to  Paris  in a State very different from that in which he had left it He had hitherto been too successful with the Ladies to leave him any Doubt of making an Impression upon a Heart wholly disengaged the Coldness with which the Countess received his Offers he attributed to her Regard for the Chevalier whose ardent Passion for her no one was ignorant of the Count of  Polan  being fully persuaded that when his Rival was removed he should find no other Obstacle to his Wishes in the Heart of Madam  de Berci  resolved to prosecute him for his Brother's Death with the utmost Rigor and sacrifice him at once to his Vengeance and his Love  The Month granted by the King for the Chevalier  des Essars  to make his Appearance in being now fully expired his Pardon was cancelled and the Count of  Polan  was determined if possible to hinder it from being ever renewed He remonstrated to the King that the Chevalier's Guilt could no longer be doubted since he had neglected to lay hold of his Majesty's Mercy which had given him so fair an Opportunity of clearing himself he alledged that his Flight was as well a Proof of his Crime as the Terrors of his Conscience for brave as he was allowed to be he would not have shunned the offered Combat had he not known he had a bad Cause to support The Count then humbly intreated his Majesty to revoke the Pardon he had granted to the  Chevalier  des Essars  and to suffer Justice to be executed upon the Murderer of his Brother or at least if in his Absence any one was presumptuous enough to maintain his Cause to permit him to challenge him to the Field and trust his Vengeance to the Decision of Arms  The King did not think fit to grant all that the Count of  Polan  demanded but contented himself with declaring that if in the Space of three Weeks the Chevalier  des Essars  did not appear to answer the Count's Challenge or some one for him his Pardon should be cancelled and his Person wherever he could be seized delivered into the Hands of Justice He then commanded that the Combat should be fought on Horseback and in his Presence that the Combatants should be in compleat Armour according to the ancient Custom of the Kingdom of  France  The old Marquis  de SaintSauveur  hearing of this Decree dispatched his Son immediately to  Gascony  in Search of the Chevalier although he was hardly yet recovered of his Wound and having prevailed with the King to order that all Proceedings against the Countess his Daughter should be stopt till farther Informations could be had with regard to her Husband's Murder he fixed his Residence at  Champiegny  expecting with great Anxiety and Impatience the Event of the young Marquis's Journey in which they were all so much concerned  The END of the Third PART  VOL I
