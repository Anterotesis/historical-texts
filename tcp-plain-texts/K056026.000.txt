LONDON Printed by  W Botham  for  James Knapton  at the  Crown  in St  Paul  's ChurchYard MDCCV  AN ENQUIRY INTO THE ORIGIN OF  FOSSILSHELLS  c  SIR  AMongst the unusual Workings of Nature the Original and Formation of these pretty and sometimes surprizing Appearances have of late busied the Heads and exercised the Thoughts of some of our greatest Theorists to conceive and to give the World a satisfactory Solution of it  This if ever it be done is to be expected from such who have had the Opportunities to make the best Collection of those Figured Substances and to  observe their Matrices and places of existence and who have most carefully traced the Impressions of Nature and have examin'd the Force Extent and Determination of her Plastick Powers in other Processes of her Operations From such we may one day expect when a long train of new Discoveries and Trials has ripen'd things for it what upon due Proofs and evident Demonstrations the World may call a general Satisfaction And what has hitherto been perform'd of this nature hath in the opinion of some rather served to enlarge our Doubts and to quicken our Inquisitiveness than to fix or determine our Judgment as in a solid acquiescible Solution of that Particular Yet this must in no wise discourage us from offering towards it in the mean time for perhaps when the wish'd Conclusion sees the Light its Birth may be facilitated by every Conjecture that hath gone abroad about it  The several late Opinions on this Subject vastly disagreeing between themselves as they are brought to serve several Hypotheses we may generally sort and distinguish under these two Heads  viz  First  Of those who strenuously contend that these form'd Substances Shells Bones and other peculiar Fossils are the exuvious Remains and the true and real Parts of Marine Animals by some extraordinary Fate scattered and left embodyed in the several Consistencies of the upper Crust of the Earth where mixt with various sorts of Bodies they came by means of certain lapidific Juices to be congealed with them leaving there either their Marks and Signatures on their Containing or Contained Concrets or else Preserving their Bulk Figure and in some places their Frame and Contexture firm entire and unaltered to this day  Secondly  There are other Persons who maintain and warmly avouch that these form'd Bodies taken out of the Earth are indeed the direct and regular Workings of Nature wherein she sometimes seems to sport and play and make little Flourishes and Imitations of things to set off and embellish her more useful Structures and that those Formations had no other Original than what her plastick Power exerted in the forming of them in those very places  where they are found and taken up These are the two main Heads of the disagreeing Opinions in this Affair which for your satisfaction I shall first compare and examine severally and then as you desire shall attempt to propose a middle way to solve the Difficulty which at least shall be very agreeable with the Order of Nature and the Mechanical Powers of Matter which is all I can promise towards the advancing of that general Satisfaction  The first of these Opinions I must confess in the Grounds of it appears very plain and rational but as to the manner of the Conveyance and Dispersion of these exuvious Concrets unto such remote and different places it must be confess'd to be encumber'd with very great and insuperable difficulties So also the other Opinion is consonant enough to the Laws and Powers of Nature but when we take into consideration the End Designment and Purposes of Nature in the production of these prettily form'd and little useless Things it encounters with no small difficulty to support and defend it For what more obvious than this reflecting Thought  viz  To what purpose should  a Tooth be made without a Jaw or Mouth To what end should a Shell be form'd without an Animal Inhabitant and to imagine it to no end would be too mean a thought of the acknowledg'd Prudence and Sagacity of Nature which she is seen to observe in all her Workings To fancy her tricking and sporting is too trivial and lusory for her severe and rigid Constancy  Now indeed tho' we may of the one very justly and reasonably ask the question how these Shells Bones  c  came to be lodged in those deep and thick  Strata  of Stone and Earth and found on the highest Mountains so far distant from their natural Element and 'tis very true that without a reasonable and satisfactory account of this we may as justly reject the Conclusion that is deny that they are the true genuine and real Parts of those very Animals which they so intimately and undeniably resemble  Yet of the other Opinion tho' we cannot give a determinate account to what end and purposes Nature produced these pretty Resemblances of the parts of living Things there being very  many things obscure and unperceivable in her Designs and Purposes amongst which this very thing does and perhaps for ever will as to us lye dormant in the Cabinet of her Secrets after all our most curious Views and Enquiries about it yet if it may be possible that She may have some ends in it it is Ground enough for us to establish the Supposition  viz  That Nature is the immediate Parent of them even in those places in which they are found and that too without giving the Atheist any Advantage by it as some persons have been needlesly apprehensive  For indeed there will appear upon a just view of the matter a very great difference between the difficulties which may occur to us in both these respects that is between that of the Instrumental Causes and that of the Ends and Purposes of Nature We have in view and we may inquire into and examine all the material Means and Instruments by which the Conveyance and Settlement of these Marinelike Substances may be effected and with which they may have been transported from their native Dwellings to the Beds and  Lodgments where they are now found to rest in and if we find and plainly apprehend from the State of Nature from the Testimony of Sacred Records and from other Assurances a manifest impossibility in these Means and Instruments to perform that Work we may justly deny the Fact But in the other Opinion the case is quite otherwise we have not there before us we cannot examine into and calculate all the Ends and Designments of Nature And if it be possible she may have some ends tho' unknown to us in the production and forming of these regular Fossils we are to accept the Proposition in the main there appearing no feasible way to infringe and overthrow it  The first Hypothesis is I confess asserted and maintain'd by very Learned and Ingenious Persons but as to the manner of that supposed Conveyance of those Fossil Shells from Sea to Land it involves in it particularly in some of their Explications of it such strange Inconsistencies and Abhorrences to the establishment of Nature that the very naming of them is enough to subvert it  'Tis true the Patrons of this Hypothesis have found in the Variety of these  Fossils such appearing Symptoms and Indications of their having once been the Parts and Appurtenances of Animal Marinebodies that without manifest violence to their Faculties they could not choose on such appearing Probabilities but assert them such There frequently appearing immured in the densest Concretions of Marble Limestone and Chalk vast numbers of Cockles Oystershells Escallops Periwinkles and other variety of Shells belonging to Seas and Rivers some of them broken some entire being as Dr  Woodward  affirms  precisely of the same Size and Figure  Dr  Woodward  's Essay  Page    with those now found on the Seashores of the same Substance and Texture consisting of the same peculiar Matter and this constituted and disposed in the same manner as is that of their respective Fellowkinds at Sea Nay more▪ the tendency of the Fibres and Striae the same and alike in both the Composition of the  Lamellae  constituted by these Fibres the same in both the same  Vestigia  of Tendons▪ by means whereof the Animal is fastened and joyned to the Shell in each of them  Besides saith he these Fossil Shells are attended with the ordinary Accidents of the Marine ones They sometimes grow to one another the lesser Shells on the larger they have  Balani Tubuli vermiculares  Pearls Coral and the like still actually growing on them and which is very considerable they are most exactly of the same specifick Gravity Nay farther they answer all Chymical Tryals in the same manner as the Seashells do their parts when dissolved have the same appearance to view the same smell and taste they have the same  Vires  and Effects in Medicine when inwardly administred to animal Bodies  Aqua fortis  Oyl of Vitriol and other like  Menstrua  have the very same effects upon both  In a word nothing can be seen in the true Marine Bodies at Sea but may be paired and sampled in the like on Land except a living Inhabitant  He farther adds  That so exactly conformable to the Marine ones are those Shells Teeth Bones which are digg'd out of the Earth that tho' several hundreds of them which I now says he keep by me have been  nicely and critically examin'd by very many learned Men who are skill'd in all parts of History and who have been particularly curious in and conversant with Shells and other Marine Productions yet never any Man of them went away dissatisfied or doubting whether these are really the very  Exuviae  of SeaFishes or not Nay which is more to my purpose adds he some of the most eminent of those very Gentlemen who were formerly very doubtful in this matter and rather inclined to believe that these were natural Minerals and who had wrote in defence of that Opinion do notwithstanding upon strict and repeated inspection of these Bodies in my Collection and upon farther inquiry and procuration of plain and unalter'd Shells from several parts of this Island fully assent to me herein and are now convinc'd that these are the Spoils and Remains of Sea Animals  These great and pregnant Testimonies of Similitude between these Marine and Terrestrial Products have induced several Persons of this and other Nations as well as Dr  Woodward  to believe  them all to have one and the same Original and that those Shells Teeth Bones that are thus found in Stones and Earth the pieces also and fragments of them have been the  Exuviae  or spoils of Marine Animals But to demonstrate how and by what means they came to be so dispersed and lodged in Earth Rocks and Stones so far from their natural Element  Hoc opus hic labor est  this has extreamly perplexed their thoughts and has set some of them on strange attempts to endeavour to loose and solve the Difficulty  It was plain that nothing but the universal bulk of Water in which these Shells they say were generated could perform this Work but to convey these Shells into great depths in the firm and compacted Body of the Earth and there too into the most dense and solid  Strata  of Rocks and Stones by the only means of this Fluid into which it naturally has no access is a difculty they could not surmount  The Ingenious Dr  Hooke  with his Glasses looking further than many others into the Frame and Texture of these Testaceous Bodies confidently pronounces them to be the Shells of certain Shellfishes  but how they came to be intombed in those hard inaccessible Recesses it passed his skill to find out and discover He thinks it possible they might be lodged there by some Deluge Inundation Earthquake or some such like means  Fabius Columna Augustino Scilla Bocchone  Italians and Mr  John Ray  and others are of the same Opinion and give us as little Satisfaction in the point of their conveyance from Sea to Land as Dr  Hooke  has done Indeed  Nicholas Steno  an  Italian  Author in his  Prodromus  has attempted the Explication of that  Phaenomenon  but with such strange and until then unheard of Paradoxes and Inconsistencies that nothing less than a total dissolution of the Terrestrial Frame must be admitted to establish the Conclusion  From this Author it seems the foremention'd Dr  Woodward  took the first Strokes and Lineaments of his intended Natural History in relation to this  Phaenomenon  of which History he has given us a short Draught and Plan in his late Essay towards it wherein he hath improved that Notion to that accuracy and seeming probability that if the state and Constitution of Nature did  not loudly contradict it and if the Text of  Moses  for which he owns all due Veneration would afford it the Countenance he pretends to it would well deserve to be highly accounted of and we might rest as positive as the Author in the truth and certainty of its Conclusions  This Gentleman affirms that during the time of the Universal Deluge or  Noah's  Flood whilst the Waters were out upon and cover'd the Terrestrial Globe all the Stone and Marble of the  Antediluvian  Earth All the Metals of it All Mineral Concretions and in a word all Fossils whatsoever that had before obtain'd any Solidity were totally  dissolved  and their Constituent Corpuscles all disjoined their  Cohaesion  perfectly ceasing that the said Corpuscles of these Solid Fossils together with the Corpuscles of those which were not before Solid such as Sand Earth and the like as also all Animal Bodies and parts of Animals Bones Teeth Shells Vegetables and Parts of Vegetables Trees Shrubs Herbs and to be short all Bodies whatsoever that were either upon the Earth or that Constituted the parts of it if not quite  down to the Abyss yet at least to the greatest depth we ever dig I say saith Dr  Woodward  all these were assumed into and promiscuously sustain'd by that Water in such a manner that the Water and Bodies in it made up one common confused Mass  Then he adds That at length all the Mass that was thus born up in the Water was again precipitated and subsided towards the bottom That this Subsidence happen'd generally and as could be expected in so great a Confusion according to the laws of Gravity That Matter which had the greatest quantity or degree of Gravity subsiding first in order and falling lowest That which had the next and still a lesser degree of Gravity subsiding next after and settling upon the precedent and so on in their several Courses That the matter subsiding thus form'd the  Strata  of Stone of Marble of Coal of Earth and the rest of which  Strata  lying one upon another the Terrestrial Globe or at least as much of it as is ever display'd to view doth mainly consist Then he proceeds to shew how these Shells Teeth Bones and other Marinelike Fossils being likewise taken  up and sustain'd in that great Fluid came to he disposed in their several Lodgments by their particular Gravities and Inclinations  This he seems to intimate as the groundwork of his intended Superstructure by which he supposes to give an undoubted Solution of this difficulty but in Propositions of this great concern and consequence he would have done well to have nicely weigh'd and consider'd every important Circumstance of such a Procedure to have given us more than I say to oblige the World to the belief of such novel Conclusions He should one would think have with great accuracy and diligence pondered and examin'd the relative Properties and Affections of the minute Contained Corpuscles so dissolved and of the great containing Fluid the Velocities and  Remora's  of different descending Bodies their weight and surfaces and the Moments of time commensurate to the spaces of Motion he should have given us plain demonstrative evidence at least of the possibility of that dissolution what were the efficient what the instrumental Causes of it and have shew'd us Mechanically  and experimentally that the Minute constituent parts of any Solids when reduced to that supposed Smallness can observe those Laws of Gravity which the bigger and more heavy Compounds are observ'd to do  It being so and that this is the only fair Account we have yet had that looks like a Reason given of these Fossils being the true and real Spoils of the Ocean and that they owe their Formation and Being to a Marine extraction in that manner as Dr  Woodward  describes it I shall a little inquire into the validity and consistence of the Parts of that Account and if by that Enquiry we find it unconsonant to the  Phaenomena  of Nature and the Mechanical Laws of Matter to which it so highly pretends the whole Superstructure how speciously soever raised will of it self totter and fall to the Ground and the Patrons of that Opinion will be left to seek out some other way to fetch these scatter'd Fossils from their antient Marine Repositories and to explain it with better Success to gain assent and approbation in this thoughtful inquiring Age  First  This Author seems defective in explaining and setling his Terms that is in letting us know what he would have to be meant by Total Dissolution and Constituent Corpuscles If he understands by these general Terms all solid Bodies to be dissolved into their Granules or visible and palpable Parts it may be perhaps possible such a Dissolution being granted that there might be such a sedimenting and setling of them as he asserts according to the Specifick Laws of Gravitation But if he means a dissolving of them into their  Minima Naturalia  as they call them into their invisible and impalpable Parts I mean invisible every one by it self which are indeed the prime Constituent Elements and into such they must be reduced if as he affirms all Cohaesion ceased Then 'tis demonstrable that Corpuscles so dilated are as uncapable of subsiding in any Fluid as the Parts of dissolved Copper are when mixed with the thinnest Liquids which by their Colour are plainly seen to remain incorporated with the Water in which they are sustain'd And Gold we know the heaviest of all Bodies yet observed  will not easily subside when dissolved in  Aqua Regalis  till press'd down and precipitated by another Agent▪ that draws it along with it Nay we every day see that a great proportion of Terrestrial Matter when reduced to Steam or Vapour the parts whereof are yet much more gross and bulky than where all Cohaesion perfectly ceases rather ascend than descend even in a lighter Medium than Water the Parts thereof being broken and dissolved to that Exility and Lightness that  Quantum pro quanto  they become lighter than the Air in which they fluctuate Then how much lighter than Water would these Parts be if as Dr  Woodward  expresses it all their Cohaesion perfectly ceased in it So far is he out in the main and principal part of his Assertion and so unlikely therefore is it that these Fossil Marine Remains were that way conveyed into their present Repositories from whence they are now digged out and discovered to us  Secondly  Granting the Doctor's Corpuscles to be of a larger size than the ultimate Minute Atoms and that That dissolution he imagines affected only  the  component Granuli  of the  Antediluvian  Earth of Stones Mettals Minerals  c  yet these being taken asunder and assumed into an ambient Fluid how incredibly vast must the Orb and extension of that Fluid be to contain the diffused and expanded Mass of these dissevered and elated Corpuscles especially to afford every one of them space and Elbowroom to run their Career and perform their respective Specifick Descents and Gravitations  Thirdly  That such an Orb and Expansion of Water as will appear at a moderate Computation necessary to sustain the whole Terrestrial Mass of Matter and to give to every part of it a full Scope and Latitude to act and perform the said Descents and Gravitations exceeds possibility in the ordinary State of Things is made evident by this Demonstration  A The Abyss  B The  Terraqueous  Globe  C The vast Sphere of Water sufficient to give the Sustained Corpuscles of the whole Earth a  free way to gravitate and preponderate in order to form again the Body of the Earth according to Dr  Woodward  's Hypothesis  The  Terraqueous  Globe AB being by the Computation of the late best Mathematicians about Miles diameter what proportion the Water bears to the Earth in this Globe cannot be determin'd 'Tis conceiv'd by most not to exceed a third part of the Earth's Dimension The Ancients gave it a much less Allowance Now if Dr  Woodward  's Hypothesis be true the bulk of Water or that third part of the Globe AB for he fetches none from Comets must expand it self to the vast Circumference of the Globe C being at least Miles diameter which is as much as to say that the same Body of Water should exceed it self above two hundred times  Now that it must be so and that the Expansion of a Globe of Water to that vast dimension here ascertained is necessarily requisite to support his Hypothesis will appear by this The whole Body of the Earth says he was taken  asunder into Minute Parts or Corpuscles and all these taken up and sustain'd for some time in an expanded Fluid and afterward leasurely subsided along the Central Lines of that Fluid till they met and united and closed again into the same  Terraqueous  Globe AB one Atom or Corpuscle after another as they preponderated and were of greater or lesser degree of gravity Now if so then it is plainly and necessarily requisite that in that  Hydrostatic Mechanism  in that procedure of Gravitation wherein every Corpuscle took its place in the Sediment according to its specific Gravity there must be allow'd to every Corpuscle a Line of Fluid of ten times its own diameter to descend in which it must have before it can preponderate and outrun others and perform its due Course in that Race of Gravitation And what will this amount to No more than this that if we take but one half of the Semidiameter of this Globe which is the least we can assign to be dense and solid Matter and allow that to be Miles of thickness if a Line of Fluid be assign'd of ten times that length for such it must be to  give to every Corpuscle a space of ten times its diameter then it follows that to perform this there must be raised up a Sphere of Water above Miles diameter that is a Deluge above the highest present Mountains some thousands of Miles of perpendicular height a space that no less than a hundred thousand Oceans could fill a thing sure the Doctor will not affirm  For if to evidence the truth of this from the Circle A to the Circle B the thickness of the Terrestrial Crust it be Miles as is here supposed then a Line of Atoms from A to B extended to C being the decuple Proportion must have a Semidiameter of Fluid from C to the Circle A which is Miles the least we can conveniently assign for every Corpuscle to perform in its Career of Gravitation as the Hypothesis prescribes And so it is evident that the perpendicular of that Fluid Line from C to B must be nine parts of ten which is Miles above the present Surface of the Earth And if a Mass of Water of that prodigious Magnitude rose above any point of the Earthly Globe to that height it must do so all round it the nature of that  Element obliging it to cling together in a Globular Figure or one very near it  But yet if any be prevailed upon to think that a less Space of Fluid than ten Diameters to every dissever'd Particle will suffice to perform those acts of Sedimenting which the Hypothesis before us supposes with regard to the powers of Gravitation and consequently that a lesser Globe of Water than I have computed may do the work the force of my Objection will not yet be much abated I can easily spare a deduction if the thing would bear it of three parts of four of my calculation  viz  streighten every Corpuscle to two Diameters and a half of Fluid to move in for to less than that I suppose none will demand it and yet even so much will require such an Orb of Water above the Surface of the Earth that some thousands of Oceans would scarce suffice to fill it which leaves the Matter still as we found it that is inconsistent with the Constitution of Nature in the then and present state of things  Fourthly  'Tis to be farther considered that in case it be granted that the vast Orb of Fluid upon the total dissolution  of the Earthly Globe became one promiscuous Blend or Mass of Earth and Water commixt and jumbled together in great confusion and disorder 'tis not yet Mechanically conceivable neither does Dr  Woodward  in his Essay pretend to shew how these Teeth Bones Shells and other instanced Fossils had not had their parts likewise dissolved in the same manner as other Concrets in that grand Separation for sure we are whatever he may fancy of a vegetative Conglutination that harder and more closely compacted Substances than them which he mentions were then dissolv'd and macerated Neither is it conceivable how the elated vagrant Corpuscles suppose of Marble Flint Coal and other more uniform Substances should in that precipitous hurry of Gravitation meet and unite again in Marble Flint and Coal and that sometimes too in Laiers beneath heavier and sometimes above lighter Substances than themselves against the order of Gravity And 'tis no less difficult to apprehend how it came to pass that in this confused hurry and agitation the heaviest Corpuscles had not seated themselves at and closed about the Center of Gravity  there being no sufficient reason yet given why solid Particles heavier than their quanity of Fluid wherein they move should not descend in that Fluid as far as the Fluid can give them way to their proper Center and therefore the whole Frame and Texture of the Earth being so dissolved as the Hypothesis supposes and every Particle of it playing in a space of Water and that Water being Specifically the same from the Center to the Circumference what would hinder the heaviest parts of Earth to fall to and close about that Center and the next in gravity to succeed and so one Sediment after another till all had settled leaving out and protruding the Mass of Water all above the united Central Solid except what might remain in little Hollows and Interstices which would appear an easie and a Natural effect of such a Procedure But why the Corpuscles D directly descending and moving towards the Center A should stop at B forming a Spherical Concave about the Center A I must profess I cannot conceive for their crowding close together could not keep up the lowest Particles still from falling Yet the Doctor must have  a central Fluid If he answers that the parts of the same specifical Body of Water are proportionably heavier the nearer they are to Center so likewise must the Earthy Particles at B be heavier than at C and so the Water of the central Concave can have no greater power of resistance against the Earthy descending parts at B than the same Water had at D or C tho' much remoter from the center they increasing or decreasing alike in gravity for both Opinions are held and in this case 'tis no Matter which as they make Proportionable approaches to the Central Point That of Dr  Burnet's  Oleaginous Surface of the Water or Mr  Whiston's  dense Fluids can be of no service here for an oyly Surface cannot be near the Center and dense Fluids remove the State of the Question they if there be such a thing are of quite different Species from the Fluid we are speaking of  Fifthly  Supposing that there might be a Mass of Fluids spherically raised to that Altitude as was capable to give the Terrestrial dissever'd Corpuscles a Scope to pursue the Laws of Gravitation and in the manner the Doctor propounds  to form the Shell and Cortex of this Earthly Globe we are left yet in the dark as to the Main and indeed what should have been the foundation of his Hypothesis that is in being assured or at least in having it intimated to us what determin'd Power Force or Quality inherent or for that time acquired it was in that  Diluvian  Water which might and could effect that dissolution and disjunction and separation of the most intimously conjoined consolidated parts of the most hard impervious Substances and could so dissolve dilacerate and take them so asunder as to volutate and raise the minute Corpuscles thereof and put them into that posture that they might statically subside and by so subsiding form the Involutions and  Strata  of this present Terrestrial Globe  All powers of Matter we know are derived from their Essence and 'tis the essential property of all Bodies to work by Contact or immediate Application of their Parts Now 'tis evident that the Parts of this Fluid could not operate where they could not come and how Water could penetrate the most compacted  solid Substances and insinuate and interpose itself betwixt their most closely conjoined and subtile Particles is too difficult to imagine And tho' the parts of this Fluid might and probably did▪ penetrate and dissolve the loose and pervious Earth into a great depth yet it seems impossible upon Natural Grounds it should pervade and come into the inmost and closest Recesses of Chalk Marble or Porphyry and other most hard and petrified Concretions of which the Earth mostly consists and if that Fluid could not enter into and pervade the Pores and Interstices of these consolidated Substances it is evident it could not at all dissolve and unchain their Links and utterly demolish their Consistence and Solidity so as that all Cohaesion perfectly ceased and if it did so in some why not in all concretions And then what will become of the Doctor's  Antediluvian  shells and of his Opinion concerning them His place of  Genesis  that God destroy'd the Earth he has very deeply expounded for surely if  Moses  had been of this Gentleman's Mind in expressing that particular he would not have told us almost in the next  words that the Earth in that sense was not destroy'd but that the Waters prevailed exceedingly upon it the highest Mountains lying Fifteen Cubits under them which if there were no more abundantly proves the contrary to the Doctor's Supposition What natural reason can be given of Rocks and Stones being then dissolved under those prevailing Waters which continued over them but one Year when we find that no such Dissolution is effected on them in the bottom of the Ocean where they have continued soaking not one but some thousands of Years  More might be said but upon a general view of the Principles this ingenious Person has unhappily espoused to maintain his Conclusion the Letter from  Oxford  charges him with more particular deviations from  Hydrostatick  and  Geometrick  Truths But however he came to fall on that fallacious way of arguing no necessity from Similitude of things which he seems to plead can warrant it he is certainly Master of great Knowledge and insight in the Nature and diversity of Subterranean Rarities and a Structure ill  founded may be built a new without discredit to the Builder and without doubt his vast Collection which they say he has from all Regions and Climats of what is rare and observable may enable him to do much that way on better and more warrantable Principles  What is or may be affirm'd by others in favour of this Opinion I cannot yet say I know nothing in Dr  Burnet's  Model that can be serviceable to it the rude Chaos as in the gross heap so in all the parts of it being too confused ghastly and illfavour'd to give a Preexistence to these prettily form'd and regular Fossils Neither will Mr  Whiston's  Theory who very warily passes by these  Phenomena  be any help to solve this point both Dr  Burnet  and he giving us such a description of the Original Chaotick Separations as will not afford the least Countenance to this Opinion which would have all these Fossil figured Concretions Shells Teeth Bones  c  to have a preexistent being before their Lodgment in those dense compacted Substances  viz  Chalk Rocks Stones  c  where they are now found and discover'd And if any  imagine that according to Mr  Whiston  the Creationdays were annual Revolutions the diurnal Rotation of the Earth about its own Axis having not begun till the Fall of Man as that Author conceiveth and that consequently a time and space of two years might well suffice for the Formation of these Bodies he must yet remember that tho' the separation of Earth and Water happened the third day or year in Mr  Whiston's  Account yet be the determin'd time and space of those days what it will the  Mosaick  account is express that the Production of Marine Animals was after that separation that is on the fifth Day or Year as the division of Sea and I and was on the third And if no such things as Shells and Bones of perfect Fishes existed before the Fifth day of the Creation as 'tis plain they did not the Earth having been seperated from the Sea some two days before it is hence apparent that the Sea or universal Fluid could not at that time leave such things in and upon the Earth such things being not at that time produced into actual perfection capable of leaving such remains behind them  If Mr  Whiston's  ingenious Fancy may carry him yet further to suggest that as this present Globe at first grew out of the Ruines of an ancient Planet dissolved to the consistence of a Comet and was after that increased at the Deluge from the  Atmosphere  of another and that consequently these Fossils might one way or 'tother owe their Original either to the preexistent or pertransient Comet then what will follow Even this If the first be true then these Shells Spines Bones  c  are the parts of Creatures that existed Gods knows where before the time of the  Mosaick  Creation If the second be granted then it will follow that there are some parts of this Globe now existing that were not then created if the  Mosaick  account as Mr  Whiston  would have it be restrain'd to this Elementary Terrestrial Globe both which are equally absurd and extravagant  Thus we see let them turn on which side they will they will find it an insuperable Task to give an intelligible account how the  Exuviae  of Marine Animals that have been once perfectly such could possibly come to be universally dispersed in and among the  several  Strata  of the Terrestrial Crust and yet there embodied even in the hardest of those  Strata  we find vast plenty of such Shells so exactly and perfectly corresponding in shape colour texture and disposition of parts with the natural ones bred in the Sea and found on our Shoars that if meer resemblance would be sufficient evidence it would be argument enough to induce any one to conclude them to be really such And did the Patrons of that Opinion but once demonstratively assign a  Possible  way upon natural and intelligible grounds of the Conveyance of these  Exuviae  to the places wherein they are now found without receding too much from the truth of Nature as well as of Scripture most Men I think would be sway'd by the force of that Argument to take them to be true real and Natural Shells Teeth Bones  c  of Fishes once bred and nourished in the Bosom Creeks and Angles of the great Surrounding Ocean But we too well know that Similary Appearances too often sham and banter our Reason and impose upon our Faculties Nature not seldom proceeding by the same means to very different ends and Intentions  and for us to determin from the Identity of her ways and measures the Identity of her Intentions in different Subjects would be very false and groundless reasoning And tho' it be inconsistent with the Wisdom of Nature or indeed of God the Author and Guider of her to work any thing to no end or purpose which makes that saying universally true  Natura nihil facit frustra  yet to conclude this or that to be to no end or purpose because we cannot assign one for instance to say that Teeth without a Jaw Bones without Flesh or Fish or Shells without an Animal Inhabitant which I find to be one of the chief Arguments of  Fabius Columna  is contrary to the designs and intentions of Nature when her bounds and limits that way many of them are unto us unknown and uncertain is to deal too boldly and unfaithfully with her And Arguments drawn from that Head how Specious soever they may be smell of too much arrogance in us to be well relished and entertain'd Nay indeed the force of that Reason if duly weigh'd and attended to will appear to incline wholly on the other side It doth not so much  conclude that these Fossil Shells Bones  c  had been once really and actually Parts of Animals  because  it may appear to be against the intention of Nature that Teeth should be found without a Jaw or Shells without living Inhabitants as it doth prove that if there do appear really and  de facto  Shells and Bones without such Concomitants or without any possibility of ever actually having them that  therefore  there are such things in Nature that are really and actually Shells and Bones though it may possibly be as much removed from the reach of our Knowledge to determin by what means as to what ends and purposes they were so produced and specificated  And truly in this regard I can see no reason why those people that daily observe the many and some very exact resemblances in the parts of Vegetables to the parts and members of Animal Bodies of which there are Multitudes of instances in  Oswaldus Crolius  his Tract of Signatures can yet by no means prevail with their Faculties to believe that there might be the like Analogies and Similitudes in the parts of Stones and Minerals  with the said parts of Animal Bodies without making them to be the true and genuine parts of some of those Bodies they resemble  Why may not Nature in her first Strokes of Congelation pursue the same Paths and draw the same Lines both in the Formation of some parts of Clay Stones and Marchasytes and in the framing of Oystershells Cockles and Perwinckles  c  as well as she is observed to delineate very like Strokes in the head of Poppies with those in the Skull of Man in the Jewsear the Leaves of Coltfoot with the Ear in the Seed of  Aconitum  the Flower of Eyebright with the Eye in the Husks of the Seed of Henbane and Pinekernels with the Jaws and Teeth in the Fruit of the Citron tree with the Heart in the true  Scolopendrum Asplenum  and  Cetrach  with the Spleen of Man Some of these do with great accuracy resemble some parts of our Body and perhaps with greater than some Shellstones do their respective Prototypes  There are some Figures which are the pure effects of Mechanism and not at all the ultimate designs of Nature  and these general Forms and Models of Nature being as it were her common road she may be observed to  trace  them to several Ends to  pursue  the same Tracts to various Purposes and Intentions Thus we find in the growth of Fearn in the  Ramusculi  of Snow and Horefrost and in the freezing of Urine Nature affects one and the same way to protract her Motions Not that there doth lie any particular design upon the Figure but because it is the most  Concise  and  Expeditious  way of dilating And if it seems consonant with the usual Processes of Nature on account of  Brevity  and  Conciseness  to choose one and the same way to exert her first strokes of Motion in several Subjects tho' tending to different ends and purposes 'tis no way fair to conclude ultimate and particular Intentions from the meer position of any one of her general rules and ways of proceeding  Now that  Conciseness  and  Brevity  may be a sufficient assignable cause of the unity of her Plastick Motions in her various Structures and Efformations will appear not only from the ordinary Prolepsis we have of the Sagacity and Wisdom of Nature perceivable in her most  trite and common Operations it being the Property of  that  ever to make the shortest dispatches but also which we ought principally to take notice of from a Necessary and Mechanical  Constrainment  which the first strokes and delineations of matter lie under to form themselves with such Angles degrees of Extention proportion of Parts and other Respects and Habitudes one to another as most conveniently suit with and answer the Scope and End of their Dilatation  This Geometrical Disposition and necessary Mechanism of the first strokes of Nature on account of  Dispatch  and  Brevity  is observable almost in all constant specifical Productions of which I shall briefly touch on a few instances    st  All Vegetables of a tall and spreading growth seem to have a natural tendency to a Hemispherical Dilatation but generally confine their spreading within an Angle of degrees or an exact Quadrant as being the most becoming and useful disposition of its Parts and Branches  Now the shortest way to give a most graceful and useful filling to that space of dilating and spreading out is to proceed  in strait Lines and to dispose of those Lines in a variety of Parallels through the whole Extension and to do that in a Hemispherical or Quadrantal Space there appears to be but one way possible and that is to form all the Intersections which the Shoots and Branches make with Angles of degrees only and I dare appeal to the observation of Mankind if it be not in this manner almost to a nicety  observed  by Nature in the  first  and  primary  Directions of all Vegetable Shoots though yet when these Shoots are grown and spread out external Impressions may and always do occasion Curvites and Reflexions that is That they have the main Stem Branches Lateral Collateral Subcollateral Laterosubcollateral or into as many Divisions as Nature usually reaches to above a Horizontal Plane of or very near approaching to an Angle of which in a Hemispherical or Quadrantal Space makes all the Shoots and Directions of Branches run out into Parallels of three sorts only  viz  Perpendicular Incident and Horizontal as appears by the Figure  The Lateral Branches being all Incidents the Collateral a Composition of Perpendiculars and Horizontals the Subcollateral as the Lateral and the Laterosubcollateral as the Collateral and the distance and interjacent Spaces being all a sort of Rhomboids all these being Affections of that Angle and Section I ask if it be any other way possible for Art or any intelligent Principle to fill up this described Space more compendiously and commodiously than we find the natural  direction  of these Vegetable Shoots and Branches inclined to perform and what I demonstrate of the Superiour or  Supra  Horizontal Space the same is applicable to the inferiour or radical Dilatation though the unmanageable Stiffness of the Ground disturbs the natural direction of those radical Shoots as the violences of the Air ponderosity and other Accidents do that of the upper Branches I do not say that all Trees do grow up thus but the greatest part of them shew that Nature generally affects that Angle on which the other Properties are depending  Therefore from this Speculation we may conclude that the shortest Procedure being allowed in streight Lines and the Production of these Lines in these three sorts of Parallels being most prompt and facile and all that depending on one Angle only Nature being allowed to be a Provident Agent lies under a sort of Geometrical necessity to dispose her Emanations just thus and no otherwise in the expedition of her Plantal Ramifications And it being so that all Spreadings from a Point or Center as all Seminal Productions are affect a Sphere either entire or divided for their Activity to display in It is therefore highly reasonable those Activities should betake themselves in one and the same way in variety of Subjects and we may thence as reasonably conclude that the close invariable pursuing of that way is nothing in the World else but the effect of Mechanism and Geometrical Necessity a visible Argument that the Plastic Capacities of Matter are governed and disposed by an Allwise and Infinite Agent the native Strictnesses and Regularities of them plainly shewing from whose Hand they come  The same Geometrical Process and Order is observable also in the first Strokes of Nature in other Instances particularly in what is the Subject of this Writing  viz  the Formation of Shells In these she generally occupies a greater Latitude of Dilatation than a Quadrantal Space which in Vegetables she seems to content her self with And as the parts of Matter she imploys in the Formation of Shells are more stubborn untractable and rigid than the Vegetative Ingredients so she is oblig'd and under a necessity to draw closer Lines and to make sharper Angles betwixt her first Shoots and the  Radii  and consequently to make more obtuse ones in the transverse Lines and Peripheries or the tacking together of the main Strokes with cross and collateral Lines than what I have observed in Trees and Vegetables which is also a necessary result of Mechanism  For when a Gradual Enlargement and Dilatation proceeds from one Point or  I reckon in all Seminal Production  the Seed or Sperm to be their Root or Center from which their Lines of Augmentation are drawn and thence  their several Ends and Specification  Center as the same is manifestly apparent in almost all perfect Shells  the most  Concise  and regular way and most agreeable with the Reason of our Faculties always practised by Art performed by natural Instincts as may be observed in Cobwebs and Spiderworks is to protract streight Lines or  Radii  with equal Distances and Angles from the Center to the designed Peripherie and the determin'd Figure of the Peripherie to be according to the different lengths and terminations of those  Radii  which is seen to be performed with great accuracy and exactness in bivalved striated Shells especially Cockles and Scallop Shells both which sort of Shells affect a sort of Semicircular Dilatation and differ only in bigness and in the flatness and gibbosity of their Valves  So also in Oystershells and Muscles which seem to have another make Nature proceeds in their Formation just as the most skilful Artist would do if he had the same Materials for his purpose and the same Design and End to aim at that is in extending and shooting out a multiplicity of their  Ramellae  each one larger than another and plated one upon another from the Root or Center to the Peripherie or Circumference as may be discovered by  the rotting of these Shells in the Earth or by dissolving them in Vinegar or any other  Menstruum  These smooth and laminated Shells seem to be more loosely and weakly built than striated Shells because they are naturally fix'd to a place by a Root or Tendon and are not exposed to the Volutation of the Sea which would require more strength and firmness as is observed to be in the more lasting striated Shells  Thus we may Geometrically conclude that all Plastick Dilatations proceeding from one Point or Center have on account of  Conciseness  or  Expedition  a natural Tendency to a sort of Spherical Figure either whole or in part and near which abating the Distortions of Gibbosities and Contractions of Brims and Edges all Shells usually arrive Nature being under as great a Necessity of forming these Figures either quarter half or full Rounds or near approaching them as any Artificer is of making round Wheels to perform the Motion of Machines and Movements But in the Formation of Shells this is yet further to be considered that they are naturally and originally designed to be the containing Teguments and Defences  of contained Animations and on that account the End being the chief Regulator in all Structures in the growth and augmentation of these Shells their Plastick Matter issuing and streaming out of one Center or Spermatick Point to build the Frame and Texture of a Shell or hollow Cottage for the Fish to secure it self and inhabit it is Mechanically necessary that all Shells naturally tending to a Spherical Dilatation their Plastick Matter flowing equally round their Spermatick Point or Center should be either Bivalves that is two Compress'd or Contracted Hemispheres their Segments or Openings intersecting their divided Pole or Center or one round hollow Cone as all turbinous and Ophiomorphous Shells abating their Folds and Twistings seem to be So likewise it is necessary that such shelly Dilatations as do not flow circularly but occupy only one part or space of a Circle should grow triangular and so have their Central Angle folded in with as many turnings as its length will bear and in that folding have the Sides and Arch a little bent and contracted for a convenient Cavity for the Fish to dwell in  and such we find it exactly to be in that Species of Shells which are of that sort of shape and extension  In every one of these general Formations as the Figure of the dilated Mass Circular Semicircular or Triangular for on a Circle and and its central Sections I observe the Figure of all Shells to depend is a necessary result of Mechanism so the forming out of these Cones and Bivalves and Triangular Involutions which comprehend the Figure of all perfect Shells is the quickest most expedite and easiest way that the Wit of Man could invent if it had been left unto it to fold and lap up and shelter those tender Creatures So we find that the general Figure of Shells seems much to depend on a Circle and its two central Sections and as to the manner how they are formed out of them we may conceive that as the Generation of all Shells of the perfect kind proceeds from a Point or Center which is the Sperm or Seed so the protraction out of these of the Lines of Augmentation if their Root or Center be undivided and of equal strength and efficacy on all sides must be spun out and gow into a hollow Cone or Conoid  and so form if the power of Protraction join Ends the  Patellae  or broadconed Shells But if the power of Protraction be more exertive and vigorous then it draws out the Cones to a length wreathing and twisting them into Perwinckles Turbens Spindles and other Cochlear turbinated Shells and if it has not a free  Medium  to display that spiral Elevation then it compresses and folds them in a Plane into  Nautili Cornua Ammonis  and other Serpentine Figures  Next if the said power of Protraction be divided at the Root or Center and be equally strong and vigorous on each side then the Dilatation becomes bivalved and makes two irregular Hemispheres as their Lines or  Striae  calculated together plainly demonstrate extending streightning or compressing their Peripheries as the length and contraction of their Lines and Gibbosity of their Valves exact and determin forming such Shells into Cockles Escallops Oysters Muscles and all other Specificks of bipartite Shells  And lastly If this power of Protraction be severed and divided at the Root or Center into more Parts than  two then these divided Parts or Branches by such a Section as I said before must become Triangular and consequently those triangular Dilatations being not join'd together as Valves of one Shell must to form a Cell for the Fish to dwell in fold in their Central Angle turning in also a little of the Arch or Subtense of that Angle and so form the  Concha Veneris  and such Species of Shells as seem to be made up of involved triangular Dilatations  Now from all this I propose it may be considered that if some Figures be the necessary result of pure Mechanism and if the primary Exortions of Nature do necessarily and mechanically fall into those Figures and lastly if the more general Forms of Plantal and Testaceous Dilatations be those necessary Figures why should we stand amazed and wonder that in the Original Congelation of Bodies there being then an Infinity of such Exortions some parts of Matter should run into these Forms and Figures which they were as necessarily drawn and moulded into on account of Mechanism as any growing Shell or Plant that Sea or Land can afford us Nay this thing being well adverted  unto it should rather draw our wonder on the other side that is that we find so few of these Figured Concretions in congealed Substances no Plantal Delineations save a few now and then in Coal and Slatestones and not very many shelly Impressions but in such places where a Calcatious Matter of which Shells consist predominates and abounds  But although this way of proceeding may very well account for many  Phaenomena  in the Theory of Shells and other Fossil Rareties in a general view of similary Forms and Appearances yet I must confess it does not reach to solve the most considerable Difficulties that Theory is encumber'd with  viz  Particularly though general Figures may be the effects of Mechanism yet it may and ought to be reasonably demanded how the specifical Determinations of those Figures how the Contraction and Curvitudes and Angles of the direct and transverse Lines and  Striae  and other Specifications of Fossilshells the Insertions of their Valves their Diaphragms and the Symmetry and Order and the gradual Disposition of all the parts of them came exactly to  be of the same Make Contexture and Dimensions with those Marine ones of their respective Kinds which manifestly proceed from a Seed or Sperm How also those Plantal Delineations in Coal and Slatestones should circumscribe their Foliations and terminate their Lines to the exact Figures of several sorts of Fearn and especially into the Proprieties of Hartstongue Cinquefoil Clovergrass Strawberry Leaves which are uncontestedly Seminal Products as I hear they are observed to do to perform all this is plainly above the Mathematicks of Nature and since it is done it becomes an Objection that will supercede and raise our inquiries from these mean and lusory Effects of Mechanism to the Contemplation of a higher and more powerful organizing Principle capable of guiding and specificating the Motions of Augmentation unto all those determined Figures in order to give it a compleat and satisfactory Solution And this Principle however it be conceived to be in a way to produce these Effects can be no other than a powerSeed or Sperm And if there be not a possibility in Nature of finding out  a way by which this efficient might be the cause of these Effects I think we may cease our Inquiries about it and let it rest for ever in the most recondite Cabinet of Natures unrevealed Secrets But if it appears possible or any way probable that these surprizing Effects may be the Products of Seminal Parents as their like are in other Circumstances I hope the Patrons of the first Opinion will appease their Scruples and the Solution of the greatest difficulty in that Theory the said possibility being once demonstrated will become very natural intelligible and easie  In order to which having from what evidence we have of the true State and Constitution of Things conceived some Grounds for such a possibility I think it not unacceptable to lay out some poor Endeavours to elucidate a point of that concernment to the Curious in which yet I shall no farther attempt than to offer a few problematical Conclusions which if they be solidly evinced and demonstrated as much as the Nature of the thing will bear will I presume infer a possibility at least if not some degree  of probability that these  Osseous  and  Testaceous  remains taken out of the Earth are the Products of and owe their Formation and Existence to what we call Seeds or Spermatical Energies To which Conclusions I shall a little strew the way with these Praeliminary  Postulata  or Propositions which being well grounded and established the Consequences I shall draw from them will be the more firm and immoveable And therefore  My  first  Proposition is that the Sphere of Matter consists of Space and Body and consequently of parts really divisible to a vast degree of Minuteness  Secondly  That the just Magnitude of any of the Aggregates or united Portions of these Parts as to us is utterly unassignable and what we may determine of their  quantum  is only Mathematical and Comparative with relation of one Aggregate to another  Thirdly  That there are certain Portions of this Matter of extraordinary Fineness and Activity called Seed or Sperm indued with a Power of unfolding and augmenting themselves unto determined Shapes and Measures of Extension  Fourthly  That Generation Growth and Corruption are but the Rise Progress and Rest the Explication Motion and Pause of these Seminal Powers and Activities  Fifthly  That these Seeds or Spermatical Portions of Matter contain within them entirely and individually the Body or Bodies they produce and all the parts of those Bodies as Sinews Muscles Bones Shells and the like and as it were the Seeds too and component Particles of those Parts in immeasurably small and unperceivable Proportions  Sixthly  That these Seminal Collections of prolifick Matter were at first prepared modified and produc'd into Being in the Primigenial Chaotick Fluid  Venus orta mari  and still require a watry Vehicle to unfold and propagate  Seventhly  That all the now solid Parts of concreted Matter or at least a great and vast deal of them have been originally a fluid Mass or substance highly agitated and from that State by several degrees of Lentors and Arrestments of Motion they thickned and coagulated into various sorts  and qualities of Fluors and thence after some Separations congealed and hardned into this present Terrestrial Crust consisting of Clays Stones Marchasits Minerals Metals and common Earth  These short and previous Hints which I lay down as the Grounds and Evidence of my Conclusion are in themselves very Natural and Intelligible and as such have been all of them propounded asserted and vigorously maintain'd by very many learned Men both Ancient and Modern  The first Proposition has been asserted by many Ancient Philosophers  Pythagoras Democritus Leucippus  and even by  Plato  himself Neither doth  Des Cartes  of late who seems most of any to impugn it at all invalidate what I propound by my calling it not  vacuum plenum  as the Ancients did but Space and Body which he very well allows of provided they equally fall within his Notion of Extension  The second is demonstrated by  Euclid  and generally asserted by all Micrographers and Geometricians  The third and fourth are visible Demonstrations and plain Objects of Sense  The fifth is with great probability and demonstrative Strength of Reason maintain'd by Father  Malebranch Luenhooke  and confirm'd by the attesting Experiments of Mr  Boyle  and Dr  Hooke  and assented unto by Philosophers of principal Note and Estimation  The sixth was the Ancient Hypothesis of  Anaxagoras Hippocrates  and is the approved Sentiment of the best Physiologers and Chymists that every Seminal Propagation is  ex humido  and consequently the Analogy will make the Maxim universally true that  ex aqua crescentia profluunt    The seventh Proposition is indeed a main part of  Des Cartes  his Philosophy and will if throughly contemplated both explain the Powers of Gravity and account for all its Effects of Gravitation and Sedimenting as well perhaps as any of the now muchtalked of Modern Explications otherwise conceived and worded  These being established Theorems by most Men assented unto and by  very few deny'd I hope what Corollaries will necessarily and naturally flow from them will be if duly explicated of prevailing weight to infer at least a possibility of the designed Conclusion  First  I offer from the first Proposition that it is possible there may be exact Mechanisms and Fabricks of most exquisite Contrivances and Dispositions of Parts contain'd in the very least as to us and utmost conceivable Minuteness of place there being in that  punctillo  a Body to extend and a Space to be extended in and as a consequent of that from the second Proposition that by much the greatest part of Animal Speciesses and individuals are undiscovered by us being as to us so extremely small that without the help of Glasses not one of a Million can be seen and distinguished And Mr  Lewenhooke  assures us that by these helps he has discovered some Animals which were so exceeding small that saith he if a Grain of Sand were broken into of equal parts one of these would scarce be exceeded in bigness by one of these Creatures And Dr  Hooke  goes yet farther who says that he had discovered some Animalculs  so excessive small that Millions of Millions of them might be contained in one drop of Water And therefore if there might be actually so many Millions of these altogether compleat and perfect Creatures existing in a drop of Water what an unconceivable infinity of them in their Seeds and contracted Parvitudes might in the beginning exist in the whole Mass of Waters  Secondly  I offer from the third fourth and fifth Propositions that if all animated Creatures do exist in their Seeds though in a contracted State and in vastly lesser Dimensions yet  Compleatly  and  Perfectly  that is as compleat and perfect Beings as they would be in their utmost Specifick Magnitudes and Extensions It is therefore very agreeable with the order of Nature and Divine Wisdom that the first Creation or primary Production of these Beings Man's excepted should be in their Seeds and contracted Parvitudes they lying there as compleat and perfect as in their utmost Bulks and Explications of Extension  Now it being supposed that the primordial State of animated Beings  Man's excepted was in their Seed or Sperm it is easily conceivable that these primary Seeds Ovaries or epitomiz'd Animations and contracted Abstracts of Things being in that State absolutely and compleatly perfect and on that account in an agreeable Condition to come from the Hands of God 'tis I say conceivable that as many of them as met with a fit Medium and proper Matrices and places of Explication were then and there in a natural way by assumption of peculiar Particles of Matter that were more or less abounding in such places to explicate and enlarge themselves to their determin'd specifick Bulks and yet in those Extensions to carry with them their Ideas and Miniatures  in parvo  to continue their successive Explications and Enlargements from that time properly called Generation to the World's end Which latter I call the Seeds of Generation as the former may very properly be called Seeds of Production  Thirdly  I offer from the sixth Proposition that these Seeds or spermatical Activities contracted formed and qualified as in the foregoing Propositions when first created and produced into beings  in and for some space of time lay dispersed and floating through the whole Mass of the first Universal watry Fluid which being the first Matrix or Principle of Corporification if I may use that Word and the only capable one in Nature of yielding Room and Materials for growth and Augmentation was on that account the fittest Repository to lay up those Eggs of things and by and with the convenient Instrumentality of it to brood and hatch and to dispose and distribute them to their peculiar Elements and Places of Faetation in order to set on maintain and conserve their successive Generations to the World's end  Fourthly  I offer from the seventh Proposition that when this Universal Chaotick Fluid the first Conservatory of these Corporeal  Activities  underwent further Separations a great deal of it came to obtain greater and greater Degrees of Coagulating and to be condensed into still more gross and thicker Fluors or a sort of soft ouzie Consistency I say in this coagulating Recession or Precipitation of the Chaotick Fluid those Kinds of Sperm floating in it which were Productive of Aereal  Animations to cover and inhabit the Face of the Earth had more of Air and Life in their Composition and were consequently lighter and therefore statically ascended and kept up in the higher and purer Regions of this thickning Mass until upon appearing of the dry Land they came to be left in plentiful Proportions on the Surface of it there to produce Plants Animals and other Furniture of that fruitful Element  Let the Earth bring forth the Living Creatures after their kind  Gen  But the other kinds of Sperm the Seminary of the Ocean the Squammose the Crustaceous and especially the Testaceous Kinds being more gross and heavy than the former and of greater Agreeableness and Congeniality with the watry Consistence descended with and stuck in it and when that thickening Fluid grew yet more coagulated and condensed vast Proportions of those grosser Sperms might come to be impacted and incorporated in its thickest Sediments and condensed Fluors and so came to be closed up in the congealing Masses which then formed and constituted the  Strata  and Involutions  of this Terrestrial Globe  In this state of things we are also to conceive that when the various sorts of these Sediments once settled and when the  detruded  Juices and condensed gravitating Fluors the most defaecat and purest of them such as became the component matter of Clays Stones Minerals  c  commenc'd the Act of Congelation and began to consolidate and petrify it is apparent from the third Proposition that these Sperms and Seminal Activities whereever they were first of all began to put out and exert their strokes of Dilatation in which act of Congeling and Consolidating the Matter of those Flours in which the said Seeds or Sperms were included coming by degrees to a stony Hardness we must imagine then that these vigorous Activities while yet the Matter wherein they were lodged was raw soft and fleeting so far acted and put forth their peculiar Energies and Powers in displaying and expanding themselves as the parts of that Matter which they were invested with could fit and supply them with proper and agreeable Materials Which could be no more than in the  Testaceous  Kinds  to build up the Fabrick of their Shells which they might perform there compleatly and exactly that lapidifick Matter being the proper Aliment of that part of the Sperm that lay within the Mineral Province and was to shoot out into Shells and Teguments And also the other fishy part of the Sperm being there out of the Animal Kingdom failing for want of due Matter and Aliment to work upon the contained Intervals and Spaces of those shelly Concretions which the Muscular fishy Exertions of the Sperm were to occupy for want I say of that due Matter to give it Increase and Animal Production those Intervals came to be filled up instead of Fish with the common Matter of those petrifying Juices which they were included in or with the purest and most lubrick parts of Matter as Spar Flint  c  that ran in and filled their Cavities  But in the  Squammose  and  Cartilaginous  Kinds of these Sperms detain'd as beforesaid in these detruded coagulating Juices their plastick Exertions had much less of these fit Materials to act upon yet we may well suppose that their quick and more vigorous  Activities might there also in the same manner begin to display their vital Shoots and Formation and where they chanc'd to meet among those stiff unwealdy parts of Matter with agreable Materials which must have been very rare and uncommon they might hit here and there where they met with such on the Formation at least of their hardest  Osseous  Substances as Teeth Spines Ribbs  c  and form those into Analogous Figures At the same time the other parts of the integral  Compages  all failing where the Portions of Matter to be acted upon were too course and untractable to be wrought and modified into an  Organical  Consistence In short such parts of these Animal Seeds as bordered upon the Mineral Kingdom might very well be form'd into Shells and Bones the rest for want of proper Matter all failing  These Processes of Spermatical Exertions I reckon all along as primary Productions or the Original Formation of things unto their specifick Magnitudes and Perfection pursuant to that Allpowerful Word  viz Let the Earth bring forth let the Waters bring forth abundantly  and not as Generation  which I reckon a secondary Production influenc'd by that other efficacious Command  viz Increase and multiply  And therefore to conclude agreeable with the Mosaick Accounts with the order of Nature and with the Mechanical Capacities of Matter I affirm from the foregoing Propositions that the Creation of these Seminal Powers and Corporeal Vehicles of Life was done on or before the first Day of the Mosaick Creation and is there symbolically express'd by Light and Darkness and that from that time these original Seeds of Things gradually one after another arrived unto their full Dimensions Habitudes and Perfections in the space of six Days in which time especially the third and fourth Day when the  Coagulum  of the Earth newly separated from the Water was very raw soft and yeilding and the hardest Rocks▪ and  Strata  of it were yet in their Gellies Then I say it is not unreasonable to conclude that these mentioned Sperms left included in the various Juices of the concreted Earth might very well perform those Feats we now behold  with wonder and which have exercised the Thoughts and busied the Inquiries of all Ages especially of this wherein we live  Now on the whole matter having briefly premised or rather hinted what I conceive just necessary to conclude this Point the Consideration before me falls in and naturally determines in this Issue which yet I am very far from pretending to obtrude with any degree of certainty but only to propound as a probable Conclusion  viz  That all Fossil Shells Bones  c  digg'd up and found entomb'd in Slate Stone Chalk Marble  c  all the Parts and Contents of them however wreathed marked and striated are on the one side so much the Productions of Nature that they were originally formed and figured in those very places from whence they are taken up and yet are also on the other side so much the Remains of the parts of those Fishes they do imitate that they are the Productions of the same univocal Sperms which those parts of Animals they resemble are derived from In which Point methinks the two contesting Parties so nearly come together that it is not to be despaired but that if any undertakes  to make a full prosecution of this Theory and by many Discoveries and Experiments that are requisite to it set things in their due Light there may be such a solid scientifical Account handed out as will sufficiently answer all the  Phaenomena  that occur in this Speculation and give therein a determining satisfaction to all rational Inquirers which is much desired by  SIR  Your humble Servant  c  POSTSCRIPT  ALthough the Propositions laid down in this Letter may justly and naturally import at least a Possibility of a Spermatick Origin of those Fossil Shells Bones and other Shelllike Impressions often appearing in Stones Rocks and Clay in the manner I have accounted for yet if this Theory and what I have attempted in it takes in any thing contrary or indeed dissonant to the  Mosaick  Accounts in the just and natural and now generally received sense and acceptation of them  ibit in ignes  let it be dash'd out and expunged for ever  But that it may appear to be far otherwise that it may demonstrate the Grounds on which those Conclusions were built which urg'd that Origin to be in themselves very agreeable with the Sense and Letter of  Moses  and that the Discourse and Inferences made on that Subject may also appear innocent and able to stand on a warrantable Bottom  I shall here sum up those Propositions and place them in that Light and Evidence from the Texts of  Moses  as they stand related one to another that I hope upon an impartial View of the Parallels there will be little or no scruple to be made of the warrantableness of the Theory in relation to Sacred Scriptures Let the natural Grounds and Philosophy of it be their own Advocates  The main Propositions of this Theory are chiefly reducible to these two in reference to the Texts of  Moses  on which they are grounded  The First Proposition  And the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the Face of the  Deep  and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the  Waters  And God said Let the  Waters  under the Heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the  Dry Land  appear  Gen  The First Original Matter of this Elementary System or Earthly Planet was an irregular formless Fluid condensed and coagulated by gradual Separations and Digestions into the Form of dry Earth Air and Water surrounding and embracing each other in the manner we behold  This Proposition is no other in the true and natural Idea of it than what  Moses  affirms What he calls on the one side  Deep  and  Waters  is called here a  Fluid  and what he calls  gathering together  is here term'd  Coagulation  and  Digestion  which being in effect no other than General and  Synonymous  Terms importing one and the same thing may very well be connext together and come under one Notion and what consequently results from the one may therefore justly be entitled to the other  The Second Proposition  And the Spirit of God moved  hatched brooded  Gen  compared with  Deut    upon the Face of the Waters And God said let the Earth bring forth let the Waters bring forth and the Earth and the Waters brought forth abundantly Gen  The Creation of all Speciesses of Vegetables and Animals whether of Sea or Land was in their Seed or Contracted State and Parvitude out of which the Earth and Waters when once settled at God's Command brought them forth as from their Original Matrices and gave them growth and Sustenance to arrive to their utmost Specific Bulks and Perfections  The former part of this Proposition I confess at first view seems to have but little Countenance from the parallel Texts yet the Word  Mirachephet  there may admit of an Interpretation which may afford some hints of the Original Make and Construction of these extraordinary Machines the Seeds and Miniatures of Things even in the unseparated and disordered State of the Primitive Deep or Chaos But the latter part seems a more natural and easy Paraphrase of the parallel Texts the Earth and Waters being only said to produce or bring forth those Plants  and Animals which by  Moses  his Phrase and way of Expression plainly implies their actual existing and having been created some space of time before the Production he mentions of them at the third fifth and six Days For if they had been then created the Holy Penman had a Word at Hand  Bara  or even  Gnascha  by which he expresses the Formation of the first Man which might have compleatly signified their being then made or created But since he expresses that act by other Words  viz Dascha Scharatz Jatza  importing no more than Production or indeed ordinary Generation as will appear evidently by comparing those of  Gen  with  Joel  of  Gen  with  Exod  and with  Psal  and of  Gen  with  Job  where the same Words plainly express no more than an ordinary Process of Seminal Births and Productions It seems therefore conclusive to me that these Words in the first of  Gen  imply no more than such a Production and that those Products actually existed before the recorded time of that Production that is among the then disordered parts of the Fluid Chaos  Now besides what may very reasonably be enforc'd from the propriety of these Words to urge a Seminal Praeexistence  Praecedaneous  to the six Days Productions the very order of Nature and the visible Scheme of Providence seem to intimate no less For as it must be allowed that Providence superintends and governs Nature in all her Works and is therefore on no contemptible Reasons called a continued Creation because it supports the acts of Nature in their created Condition I should from hence be very ready to conclude that if this continued Creation or the settled order of Providence deduces the Beginning Rise and Progress of all animated Products from what we call Seeds or Spermatick Energies that it is therefore highly reasonable the same order being no other than the Will of God and therefore constant and unchangeable that the same Process being but the Effect of that Order should likewise deduce the first Commencement of Production from and consequently prove the Creation or primary Constitution of these vital Products to be in what we call Seeds or Spermatical  Bodies And from hence it will be easy to conceive that what the Mosaick History affirms of the Earth and Water's bringing forth the first set of Plants and Animals means and should conclude no more than that as many of these Seeds as by the most wise order of Providence were in that Original Separation of Things distributed and convey'd to their proper Elements and peculiar places of Faetation the Allpowerful Word of God invigorated and quickened in those places to put forth and display their specifick Growths and Capacities of Explication And this being granted I hope the conclusion I have advanced of some of those Seeds sticking in and being incorporated with the thicker Juices of the congealing Fluid as was before accounted may be allowed to be very possible and not at all thwart the true Sense of the Mosaick Creation  But to make this yet appear more plain and demonstrable I shall summ up the Evidence of this last Proposition into this one Argument that is we must conceive that either the Bodies of Plants and Animals were actually created at the time accounted by  Moses  or they were created and actually existed some time before and were then only produc'd to take on them the State of Growth and Augmentation That those Bodies were not then created the very Words by which the sacred Author expresses the Procedure are very strong presumptive Proofs And indeed our best Expositors are not willing to allow of any Creation properly so called at that time Now 'tis evident that if they existed before at least before the  Mosaick  Days of Production they must be and exist amongst the rude and indigested Parts of the Chaos the dry Earth that is the dense coagulated Sediments of the  Mosaick  Deep having not till the third Day appeared  Gen  And if they existed in the Chaotick Fluid they must exist there either in their Seeds and Sperms as the Proposition supposes or in their Bulks of Maturity and Perfection in their mature State they could not because the crude and undigested Masses of the Chaos were of themselves an unfit and unsuitable Medium to sustain and cherish them in that state and condition therefore the Conclusion is fair and demonstrative that the  first created Bodies of all Vegetables and Animals Man only excepted primarily existed and floated in that Original Fluid in their Seeds and contracted Miniatures out of which the Holy Penman expressly affirms that they were on the third fifth and sixth Days produced and brought forth and that too in the afterwards ordinary way of Nutrition and Augmentation Nay as to one kind of these he speaks expressly to my purpose namely Plants and Herbs  And God made  saith he  every Plant and Herb before it was in the Earth and before it grew  Gen that is as was before demonstrated in the  Mosaick  Deep or Chaos and if there then in their Seeds and Miniatures  To this I add that it must be confest that the Formation of all Seeds of Vegetables and Animals was the immediate Workmanship of God himself because 'tis plain if no Fermentations no Laws of Motion no Mechanical Powers of Matter as Mr  Whiston  very well observes can of themselves reach to and frame the Structure of such extraordinary Machines as the Seeds of things are and if the immediate Creation of all the parts of Matter was at the beginning  of or rather before  Moses  his six Days as most Men are not unwilling to allow it is therefore very just and Philosophical to conclude that the most noble admirable and elaborate parts of Matter the Seeds of Things were then created too the Words of the sacred Historian as I have before touched implying that these little Bodies or most active parts of Matter must have existed somewhere before these mentioned Days of Production and where could that be but among the loose and disorder'd parts of the Chaos  And moreover if we have reason to believe that these Seeds or Sperms contain in them the entire Bodies compleatly and perfectly  in parvo  of the Individuals to be produced which they evidently do in those of Plants and by what yet appears in those of Animals too as far as our Micrometry inables us to judge and discern into the Make and Constitution of them it cannot then be thought that their Littleness they being in their Seeds as compleat and perfect Beings as in their utmost Bulks and Extension can render them or give us just cause to suspect them unworthy the immediate Hand of God  and the peeuliar Workmanship of creating Power for Great or Little is equal to that and equally becoming the Divine Work so they be in their Kinds absolutely compleat and perfect Beings  That the Creation of Matter and consequently of all the parts thereof is precedaneous to the six Days Work many of our late Expositors conclude and explain by reading the Word  Created  in the first of  Genesis  not as usually in the  Perfectum  but in the  plus quam Perfectum  as it is frequently used in the Scripture Stile and very common in the Hebrew Syntax which way of interpreting renders the Text natural and easy And tho' the word  Created  be sometime used to express  Creation  in the most strict and grosser Sense yet otherwhiles it implies no more than producing framing making as is plain by several Instances in Scripture And therefore if  Gen  be objected against the evidence of the Proposition before us  viz  That  God created great Whales and every living Creature that moveth  we are undoubtedly either to take the Word  Created  in the  plus quam Perfectum  or to take it as it is promiscuously  used for Making or Producing for the next Words clearly intimate that the  Waters  produced them and then the Sense that when God had created and the Waters brought them forth they then became great Whales is just natural and proportion'd to the other Acts of Production And therefore to give the Words of  Moses  a Coherence with himself and the established  Phaenomena  of Nature the Production there mentioned of these Creatures called  Great  on account of their vast growth must reasonably imply as in the other Particulars a seminal Origination And this way of explaining the Words of  Moses  in reference to the different Ideas of Creation and Production I find our great and worthy Commentator the Lord Bishop of  Ely  to make use of who grants these Concessions  First  That the Creation of the World and consequently of all material Beings was over before the six Days Works began  Secondly  That the six Days Works were a regular and orderly Reduction of a confused Chaos into a habitable World without any strange Miracle in every part of it  Thirdly  He supposes that for a considerable time before the six Days Work began there were such preparatory Agitations Fermentations and Separations and Conjunctions of Parts as disposed the whole to fall into that succeeding Method and to introduce the six Days Production following of which more in Mr  Whiston  's excellent Discourse of the  Mosaick Creation pag    Though this Light and Evidence from the Words of  Moses  taken in the Sense now explained led me to assert the Primary Origination of both the Vegetable and Animal Furniture of our Earthly Globe to be in their Seeds yet the Theory I offer to account for the Origin of Figured Fossils requires no more than that of Animals and but of the Marine ones too together upon what has been said with these Concessions following  viz  First  That the common Matter of our Earth was once in a Fluid State and Consistence which the  Mosaick  History proves and the Spheroidal Figure of the Earth supposes  Secondly  That at least all Marine Animals were originally created in their Sperm or Seed in that Fluid which is very easie to conceive that Element being the proper Seat and Habitation of those Creatures  Thirdly  That on the original Separation of the thicker and thinner parts of that Fluid the thinner became Air and Water and the more dense and thicker parts gradually fixed into dry Earth that is Earth Clay Stones  c  which is sufficiently confirmed by the sacred Text  Fourthly  That in the gradual fixing and coagulating of the dense and gravitating parts of that Fluid vast Proportions and innumerable Multitudes of the Seeds of Fish especially of the shelly Species were hurried down detain'd and incorporated in the strict embraces of the detruding thickning Sediments which afterward became Earth Clay Stones Minerals  c  and were there laid up and preserved for ever throughout the substance of those depressed congealing Masses  Fifthly  That at the first congealing of the more gross and heavy Masses and Sediments of that Original Fluid these  enclosed Seeds or animated little Bodies being more full of Life and replenished with greater Activity and Vigour than the other parts of Elementary Matter with the first Onset of their vital and plastick Motion disposed and figured the then soft and ductile parts of their inclosing Matter into such Forms as their peculiar specifick Exertions shot them into and wherein they remained ever after congealed and petrified And this we may conceive in the same or very like manner as we observe the Salts of some Vegetables when mixed and incorporated with Lye or Urine to shape direct and figure in a sharp Frost the congealing parts of that Liquid into their own natural Forms and Delineations And also that some Proportions of these Seeds the strongest and liveliest of them actuated so far their peculiar Ferments in that soft and ouzie Matter as to become perfect Fish of which the tender Musculary parts soon failing the more firm and durable  viz  Bones and Shells kept up their Frame and Texture and became upon a through Congealation parts of those very Concrets in which they were produc'd and in which we find them  These two last  Postulata  are but Mechanical Consequences of the three preceding ones and their Evidence depends on the Authority of them as that does on the  Mosaick  Text  Yet for a farther proof that Shells may be produc'd and perfectly form'd in a much grosser Substance than we do or can suppose the Constitution of the hardest Rocks to have been before their acquiring Solidity and Hardness that is when their parts were yet loose and in a sort of Fusion and Fluidity I have oft observ'd and sometime shew'd to my honour'd and worthy Friend Mr  Edward Lhwyd  Keeper of the  Musaeum  in  Oxford  multitudes of small very perfect Shells lying scatter'd in all Positions and of all sizes from the bigness of a small Pins Head to that of an ordinary Perwinkle in the midst and throughout the Pulp and Substance of a very thick Clay or Marle nay in one place I have seen abundance of Cockleshells most of them whole their Frame strong and durable in the midst of very tough Marle but the others were weak and brittle and perfectly white which are to be seen in twenty places in my Neighbourhood on whose Circumstances and Production for more  evidence in this Matter I shall a little insist and thus argue  These Shells must either be seminally produced in this Marle or Clav or convey'd there by Deluges or Inundations the latter is very improbable if not impossible for their Make and Texture I mean the first ones I mention'd is so thin light and friable that the least Undulation or hitting of them against other Bodies would have bruised them to pieces and they lie generally if not all in their adapted Cavities whole and entire neither is there any cause to suspect their having sunk or in any manner made their way into these thick Beds of Clay there appearing not the least Tokens of such a Passage  So that we must conclude them to have been generated there but then whether originally produc'd there at the first  Coagulum  before mention'd or afterwards sprouting out of their interspersed and latent Seeds from time to time as certain Causes concurr'd to give them Birth and Production is a Point may deserve a little consideration  First  That these Shells were not produc'd in their perfect Shapes Magnitudes and Dimensions at or before the first  hardning of the Marly Substance we have reason to presume because the Composition of them is so dilute their Frame and Texture so weakly built and unstable that the necessary Pressures of the closing and hardning Mass would have utterly ruin'd their Frame and Structure many of them being but a thin Film of a finely dilated Calx form'd into Shells but so brittle that they can scarce endure the singering of them and therefore as this Diluteness and Feebleness of their Frame is a good Argument to prove they were not thrown there by any Floods which would have dashed them to pieces so is it a proof likewise that they were not produced into the Form and Substance we see before the hardening of the including Mass Therefore we may hence in the  Second  place conclude them to have grown and sprung out of their latent Seeds in those places after the settling and congesting of the Marly Substance But how to account for their so doing in so hard a Substance I mean hard in comparison of their tender Bodies is another difficulty  To the unfolding of which I conceive that that sort of Marle being of a porous  spungy Texture was perhaps at first after its settling full of Bloats and little Holes replenish'd with a saline Juice at which the spermatick little Bodies interspersed through the whole Mass blooming and putting forth their Increase and Vegetation soon filled the  Vterus  or Cavity with an Animal Shell and the Vegetative Ferment depredating and converting the Ambient Matter into its own Substance not only encreased the Shell but also inlarged the Cavity for the growth and augmentation of it Which Process may appear probable since 'tis evident that these Shells must be form'd there sometime after the Marle's acquiring its hard and settled Consistency and even in the thickest of it there are little fibrous Pipes or Conveyances through which the animated Products of the Marle may be well conceived to receive Air and Moisture enough to sustain and accommodate them in their Growth and Maturity  I insist the more on this  Phaenomaenon  that the Proposition before us may appear more conceivable and easie instancing in these Marly Shells the visible Notes and Indications of just the same Process of Generation as the said Proposition  supposes for it supposes no more than I have I think easily and mechanically accounted for in these Marly Shells that on the like reason the same Effects might be well attributed to the same Cause and Circumstance Now from all this it is just and natural to infer and I presume few or none will gainsay that  First  if the production of these true and undoubted Shells in thick Clay or Marle sprouting out of some hidden Seeds incorporated with the Marle as certain Causes concurr'd to give them birth seems possible nay probable and almost evident to any one who views them in their Marly Cells and Receptacles and duly weighs their Circumstances it will reasonably follow that it is as possible nay as probable that those Shells now included in Chalk Stone or Marble or any the hardest Substances might be and were produced just in the same way or one not very different from it at that time when these nowharden'd Masses were in their original Clays and Softnesses  Secondly  It will from this instance follow also that if the Marine Animals were created in their Seeds or Sperms of which the crustaceous and testaceous sort are a considerable Species in the Chaotick  Fluid and if this Fluid in which these Seeds floated had a great and considerable share of it by the Divine Appointment condensing and subsiding into such spiss and dreggy Consistencies as afterward came to be Earth Clay and Stones which I take to be sufficiently authorised by the  Mosaick  Accounts it will be from hence very plain and easie to conceive and as reasonable to infer that many of these Seeds and Sperms so subsiding were detached and carried down in those thick congealing Juices where during the fused and yielding Consistency of them they were in no incapacity of displaying and actuating their Animal Ferments Now let us reflect and observe here that if in the instances I have now made use of these mention'd Shells found in Clay and Marle may not be judged to pretend to any other Origin than a seminal Production in those very Clays where they're found enclos'd whether the very same Reason will not oblige us to make the same Account of the Origin of those other Shells found in the same manner in Rocks and Stones for since the Original of these two Subjects  viz  Clays and Stones was the same why may we not ascribe the production  of these FossilShells to one uniform Cause in both these Subjects that is to those Original Seeds dispersed in the engross'd Earthy Matter part whereof by the concurrence of certain Causes came to be congealed and petrified unto a stony hardness and the other part for want of such Causes still continuing in their claiey state and condition I shall yet go one step further and only ask such as are averse to this Opinion if they allow these Shells in Marle and Clay to be the undoubted Products of that including Mass and yet will deny the other Shells found in Rocks and Stones to have been spermatically produced in those Masses and if it should so happen that part of that claiey Mass abounding with these Shells be turn'd to Stone which some petrifying Steams or Waters may easily effect I say whether in that turn of Circumstance these Persons on the Principles they go will not be thereby induced to deny what before they easily granted when indeed the pretended Difficulty is founded on no essential difference but on what is only a Mode or Accident  viz  the Laxity and Density of the same Subject  FINIS
