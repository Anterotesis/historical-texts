 ZINGIS A TRAGEDY  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  ZINGIS A TRAGEDY AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  BY ALEXANDER DOW  LONDON PRINTED FOR T BECKET AND P A DE HONDT IN THE STRAND M DCC LXIX  ADVERTISEMENT  TO those who are not conversant in the history of the Asiatic nations it may not be improper to give in brief the story upon which the Tragedy of Zingis is founded as it is taken from the TARICH MOGULISTAN or History of the Mogul Tartars written in the Persian language  In the twelfth century most of the Tartar Ordas or tribes though governed by their own chiefs paid tribute to the king of the Orda of the Keraits who held his court under the title of the GRAND CHAN in the city of Caracorum well known since by the name of Ordabalich The famous Zingis Chan who afterwards conquered all the countries from the sea of Canton in China to the Nile was prince of the Niron tribe of Tartars and from his early youth served in the armies of Aunac the Grand Chan and at last rose to the command of all his forces Zemouca chief of the Siogarates supplanted Zingis in Aunac's favor Zingis was disgraced He retired to his Orda which was in some measure independent of the Grand Chan Aunac pursued Zingis with a small force and was defeated In the ensuing year Aunac was in a pitched battle totally routed by Zingis Zangon the prince royal was slain and the only daughter of Aunac Ovisa Lug√Æn fell into the conqueror's hands Zingis having determined to give Ovisa in marriage to his favorite son Octar who afterwards succeeded him in the empire of all Asia occasioned an insurrection under Timur another of his sons who was in love with the princess Timur fell in his rebellion Ovisa died of grief and the unfortunate monarch Aunac was killed in his flight from an action in which he was defeated by a part of the army of Zingis  Zingis Chan whether we regard him as a conqueror or legislator was perhaps the greatest prince that ever appeared in history He not only secured the empire of all Asia to his posterity for some ages but even to  this day twothirds of that immense continent remains in the possession of princes of his blood So fortunate was he in his children and descendents that many of them did not yield in abilities to him and they would perhaps have equalled him in fame had his sword left them more to conquerThe Emperor of China the Mogul of India the great Chan of Tartary and the princes of the Krim Tartars derive their blood from Zingis and it is remarkable that at one period there were five hundred crowned heads of his race in Asia

faint twilight of the morning seems  To wander o'er the EastThe storms that long  Have shook the desart now are pass'd away  And Altay's stream retards the war no more  Here Zingis forms the Nirons of the west  And royal Aunac on the farther shore  Marshals the Naimans and demands his throne  Enter NEVIAN  NEVIAN  The emperor of Tartary commands  Thy presence Cubla  CUBLA  Zingis should have cloath'd  His haughty message in less odious terms  Does he presume to hope that I will join  His rebel sword against his antient lord  Tho' near ally'd to Zingistho' I own  His parts unequal'dhis desert in arms  Nevian my soul approves not of the means  By which he seiz'd the scepter of the East  And drove great Aunac from the Tartar throne  NEVIAN  'Tis less a vassal's duty to approve  Than to obey his sovereign's high commands  CUBLA  A vassal By that honor which descends  From a long line of ancestors to Cubla  My soul rejects the thoughtWhat tho' my tribe  In Aunac's wide dominions form'd a state  And my brave fathers listen'd to the voice  That issu'd from the throne and rose in arms  When war was in the fieldshall I become  The property of treasonbe transferr'd  The mean appendage of a crown usurp'd  NEVIAN  Beware of treasonCubla can thy tribe  Bold as thou art and confident in war  Contend with him who rules the Eastern world  Zingis is kingand now that homage claims  Which thou didst pay to the imperial throne  CUBLA  Presumptuous mandoes he prescribe to Cubla  Or talk of homagehe who broke all ties  That bind the faith of subjects to their kings  Whence is his right deriv'd  NEVIAN  He has been wrong'd  CUBLA  Wrong'd didst thou saywhat wrongs can justify  His usurpationShould the world permit  Private ambition thus to seize on crowns  Each daring villain that dispises life  Would be the king or tyrant of mankind  NEVIAN  Rashly thou dost condemnDoes Cubla know  The Cause and progress of this bloody war  CUBLA  From the chill bosom of the stormy north  From Corea's distant clime where I have long  Employ'd my sword against my country's foes  Last night arriv'd amidst domestic broils  I know not aught but that my king's dethron'd  NEVIAN  The prince of Soigarathe bold Zemouca  Was the first mover of this civil war  He jealous of the fame and deeds of Zingis  And that high confidence his rival held  With Aunacto the royal ear convey'd  Malicious falshoods and intended treason  At length the monarch list'ning to his voice  Divested Zingis of his high command  The chief retired and darkly pass'd along  To his own native tribethe hardy Nirons  They thought him wrong'dthey started to their arms  Determin'd to defend him from his foes  Zemouca camehis host was roll'd away  The king advanc'd in Tangut's bloody field  The valiant Zingis triumph'd o'er his lord  Amidst his ruin'd armies in the fight  The son of Aunac graceful Zangon fell  Whilst o'er his mangl'd corse his father fled  And left his capital and throne to Zingis  CUBLA  Zemouca was to blame'Twas dangerous  To drive a hero to the last extreme  The very coward when bereft of hope  Turns on the lifted sword that threatens death  But now let Zingis grant his sovereign peace  And give the nations back to Aunac's sway  Fame will applaud the deed He hopes in vain  The aid of Cubla to support his crimes  But since my sister was his favourite spouse  And gave to him a sonthe princely Timur  For Timur's sake I will not join his foes  NEVIAN  'Tis not enough Inflexiblesevere  Tenacious of his power and like a god  Decisive in his councilshe declares  Himself the foe of temporizing friends  Consult thy safetyKnow the Naiman prince  Betrays his sovereign and sollicits peace  CUBLA  Betrays the king to ZingisTell your lord  Should he imbrue his hand in Aunac's blood  Cubla must be his foeMy safety rests  Upon my swordThis day I would confer  With Zingisquickly I will join his camp  Haste and convey this answer to your chief  NEVIAN  It grieves me to behold my former friend  Thus rushing headlong into certain ruin  Cubla let me conjure theeguard thy words  And talk not thus of ZingisHe is stern  I'll bear a milder answer to the king    Exit  Nev  Enter ZENA  ZENA  Hail prince of Eluth  CUBLA  Noble Zena whence  ZENA  Straight from the tents of Zingis  CUBLA  Zingis knows  Already Cubla's mindHas Zena's sword  With fortune turn'd against his antient king  ZENA  Blame not thy friend tho' the event of war  Hath made me vassal to successful Zingis  My soul is faithful to unhappy Aunac  I mean to serve him  CUBLA  Darken'd is his fate  ZENA  Tho' few his friends since fortune left his side  Tho' scarce his strength his armour can sustain  Still unsubdu'd in soul to Altay's banks  He leads the poor remains of former fields  And strives to raise his hoary head above  The cloud of his misfortunes On thy aid  He rests his latter hopes  CUBLA  The faithless Naiman  Betrays his king  ZENA  That Cubla may prevent  CUBLA  Explain thy words  ZENA  Zemouca will protect  His aged kingNay more will raise him high  Again restore him to the Tartar throne  He plans a daring purpose in his soul  He near this place is striding thro' the night  Like the dark genius of devoted Zingis  'Tis thine to point his thunder to the mark  And rouse dishonour'd Timur  CUBLA  Ha dishonour'd  Were Timur's backward steps beheld in war  Did Timur fly  ZENA  Untarnish'd is his fame  CUBLA  Whence then is this unmeritted disgrace  That hangs so darkly on my sister's son  ZENA  When with his ruin'd armies Aunac fled  From Tangut's bloody field young Timur press'd  Upon the rear and seiz'd the hapless king  As faint and wounded by a brook he lay  His grey head leaning on his daughter's breast  His only child the beautiful Ovisa  The hero sawhe pitied and he lov'd  Brought the fair captive to the Niron camp  But gave her father's freedom to her tears  She in return bestow'd on him her heart  For this fierce Zingis from his presence drove  His generous sonThe exil'd Aunac heard  Of his fair daughter's loveher choice approv'd  And by an embassy propos'd to yield  The bright Ovisa to young Timur's arms  To name him heir of Tartary should Zingis  Consent to end with peace this civil war  CUBLA  Yet still the tyrant keeps his sword unsheath'd  ZENA  He doesnay moretomorrow Octar comes  His favorite son tho' by a second bed  To wed the weeping captiveto derive  From her a title to the Tartar throne  But e'er tomorrow should'st thou join thy sword  To bold ZemoucaAunac still might reign  And name young Timur heir to all his realms  CUBLA  But what intends Zemouca  ZENA  With the king  To cross the Altay when the night returns  With terrible assault to rush on Zingis  Amidst his armiesBy a great exploit  To win the East or lose his noble life  He sent me hitherbade me to entreat  His sister's husbandhis own former friend  If yet the memory of what Aunac was  If pity for a failing line of kings  Who rul'd mankind with justice touch thy breast  CUBLA  Gobid the chief approachThis great design  Becomes the spirit of the bold Zemouca    Exit  Zen  Th' injustice done to Timurthe disgrace  Thrown on my linethe partial favor shown  To Octar sit not easy on my mind  The voice of Aunac toothe dying voice  Of ruin'd Majesty is ecchoing here  I will support him  Enter MILA  Partner of my life  What anxious cares send Mila from her tent  At this dull hour of darkness when the world  Sleeps in the skirts of the retiring night  MILA  Why didst thou leave me Cubla Is there aught  Unfriendly from the Niron  CUBLA  Noretire  MILA  To meditate alone bespeaks a mind  Not well at ease let Mila share the grief  That labours in thy bosom  CUBLA  By our loves  I know no cause of grief Determined minds  Brood not upon misfortunes they forget  The accidents of life When this base world  Shall throw disgrace upon them forth they rush  Swift as the lightning's flash that wings the storm  And right themselves  MILA  Has Zena then inform'd  CUBLA  Yes Mila all I know how Cubla stands  With that presumptuous man He has disgrac'd  Me in my nephew Timur yet expects  My aid in battle  MILA  He commands it Cubla  Nay threatens disobedience with those frowns  That lords assume to vassals when they fail  In duty to the throne This hour Ovisa  By private message to my ears conveyed  His gloomy purpose  CUBLA  What can he intend  MILA  To treat thee as a foe shouldst thou delay  to pass beneath his standard with the morn  This tedious march from Corea's distant realms  He construes into treason but the cause  Lies in his policy thou art the lord  Of Eluth's warlike tribe A chief of pow'r  And dang'rous in the state The king himself  The allsubduing Zingis mark'd the path  Which leads to empire and he fears that Cubla  May do with him what he has done to Aunac  CUBLA  I am beset with perilsyet this state  Suits well the active tenor of my soul  Which loves to dwell in storms I have resolv'd  To stretch my hand to Aunac and support  That ruin of a king  Noise within  But hark what noise  Swells in the camp of ZingisGo my love  Regain the tentI must explore the cause  From whence this tumult roseBy dawn of day  I'll meet thy brother to concert the plan  Of deeds more daring than were e'er atchiev'd    Exit  MILA  'Tis donebut still my fears  Enter ZEMOUCA  ZEMOUCA  My sister's voice  MILA  My lord Zemouca welcome to my soul  O chief of the Soigarafrom what a world  Of troubles art thou come  ZEMOUCA  YesI have strove  With some disasters Mila since the Niron  Led his rebellious tribe to Tangut's field  And triumph'd o'er his lord Had loyalty  Been less my choiceHad ease been more my care  Than selfapproving honor and that pride  Which lov'd to stand alone when Tartary  Fell in the stream of conquest to a chief  I once scarce own'd my equal I might use  The day to visit Mila and have thrown  This cloud I borrow from the night away  MILA  How fares it with the king  ZEMOUCA  Not such his state  As when in Ordub√¢la's splendid halls  He rul'd the nationsOn the farther side  of Altay's foaming course my tribe surrounds  The king of Tartarsnarrow is the camp  Of him who covered Asia with his hosts  But still this sun which moves behind a storm  May issue forth and shew his evening beams  Before he sets in night  MILA  Should Naima's prince  Prevail in battle  ZEMOUCA  May heaven's lightning blast  His armies and himself Perfidious man  He treats with Zingis  MILA  Tartary is lost  The house of Aunac trembles to its base  And in its ruins will involve Zemouca  Why dost thou stand against a world in arms  With unavailing valor  ZEMOUCA  Hear me Mila  Ere next the night shall from these fields retire  Aunac shall reign o'er Asia I have form'd  A plot with Zena in the Niron camp  Cubia will join us with his warlike tribe  At the dead midnight hour we mean to rush  On Zingis in his tent  MILA  To rush on Zingis  The deed is desperate  ZEMOUCA  We claim thine aid  To forward our design To thee is known  The love of Timur and his late disgrace  For the escape of Aunac Thro' their tribes  The Nirons murmur for their gallant prince  Who led them often to the fields of fame  Go to Ovisa let her arm the son  Of haughty Zingis in her father's cause  Thus shall she wrest from tyranny the world  And rule the nations with the man she loves  MILA  And does my brother then resign Ovisa  ZEMOUCA  NoMila noShe beams upon me still  Thro' all this tempest which involves my soul  The Queen of AsiaBut I must be calm  The softer passions suit not with a state  So desperate as mine Zemouca first  Must stretch his hand to Zingis the event  May lead thy brother to his soul's desire  Why Mila why in tears  MILA  I'll bear my lord  Thy message to Ovisa But my mind  Forbodes I never shall behold thee more  ZEMOUCA  That heaven alone can tellmy sister stay  Perhaps thou'lt ne'er behold meand thy lord  Treads too a dangerous path Let not our foes  In thee extend their triumph to our dust  Take this    giving a dagger  It is thy thy brother's giftOur house  Was ne'er dishonour'd  MILA  Son of daring Tangor  Our house was ne'er dishonoured nor shall Mila  Stain the unclouded glories of her line  I know the purpose of this presentHere    putting it in her bosom  This friend shall rest I'll call it to my aid  When thou canst not defend me from my foes    Exit  CUBLA entering with CAREDI  CUBLA  Caredi hasten Call the chiefs to arms  Rouse my brave EluthsI will join them straight  I like not this confusion this uproar  That Zingis raises round him in his camp  He may perhaps intendMy lord Zemouca    embraces him  How fares it with my brother and my friend  I fear our zeal for aged Aunac's cause  Shall not avail  ZEMOUCA  Has Cubla learn'd from whence  This tumult rose  CUBLA  All night the high divan  Sat in the tent of Zingis and gave ear  To proffered terms from Naima's perjur'd prince  'Tis said they were axcepted But the voice  Of war resounds thro' all the Niron camp  The nations start with ardor to their arms  Some daring enterprize is formed by Zingis  Against deserted Aunac  ZEMOUCA  Fear not that  Tho' Zingis loves to move thro' bloody fields  He tries not force where policy avails  If Naima promis'd with her sovereign's blood  To end this contest Zingis will delay  To cross the AltayWhen the night descends  I will remove the kingat once prevent  The Naiman's treachery and rid the world  Of the usurper  CUBLA  But that eagle sits  Too watchful on his rockwe must not trust  Much to the foes neglect for Zingis owes  To fortune less his greatness than to skill  In war's extensive artWe are too few  To reach him thro' his armies we must raise  Some other swords to penetrate those lines  The Niron draws around him  ZEMOUCA  Our success  Depends not on our numbers We command  A hardy race the Tartars of the north  Whose souls partake the nature of the storms  That rush across their climate They delight  In the abrupt decision of the sword  And love a deed of danger Nor on them  Rest all our hopes the fair Ovisa arms  Dishonour'd Timur in her father's cause  His late disgrace ambition love revenge  Shall urge him on and should the chief prefer  A tame submission to the will of Zingis  To Aunac's daughter and the Tartar throne  Our glory must be greater and our fame  Arise proportion'd to the perils round us  CUBLA  Friend of the hapless AunacIn thy voice  Speaks forth the hero and thy noble fire  Falls on my soul and kindles it to flame  Ere next the light which now bursts from the East  Shall gleam on Altay's streams the Tartar tribes  Shall own another lord Myself will rouse  The lion Timur if that spirit dwells  In him which animates th' Eluthian line  Dishonour sits not lightly on his mind  But where Zemouca shall my tribe receive  The king to night  ZEMOUCA  Upon that narrow point  Thou seest a lonely oakThe morning star  Looks thro' its wav'ring branchesthere the rock  Stretching into the Altay breaks the stream  And forms a peaceful eddy In that place  Shall Aunac land when the wan moon descends  Behind the western hills  CUBLA  I will attend  Today the court of Zingis and disguise  For once a soul that scorns to hide its hate  I will exhibit every mark of zeal  To blot suspicion from his jealous mind  And turn the keeness of his eye from Cubla  But leave this camp the dawn already gleams  Along the field Goin that show'r retire  That darkly rushes o'er the Altay's course    Exit  ZEMOUCA  Whilst this blunt warrior void of all design  Can thus encounter perils unconcern'd  Shall I whose eye is fix'd upon a crown  And on the brightest star that ever rose  Upon the eastern worldthe fair Ovisa  Shall I shrink backShall I encourage doubt  To shake my resolutionHenceaway  All further fear of death already he  Hath stalk'd around me in each hideous form  But yet this stubborness of heartthis pride  Which bore me up against this prosperous man  Hath quite fatigued my soulI'll stray no more  Thro' Asiaevery foe I raise to Zingis  He adds unto his vassalsOn this plot  I rest my latter hopes and should I fail  I'll wrap me in my courage and retire  From this base world amidst the storms I raise    Exit  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE Ovisa's Tent  Enter OVISA from her Tent  OVISA  IF e're the spirit of a warrior slain  Journey'd in storms across the

time away  Before the shrine of beautyBlush young man  These are not arts in which our race excell'd  Nor these the means by which they rose to fame  TIMUR  Is Cubla like the world whose censure falls  Not on the guilty but unfortunate  As if success could recommend each crime  We only call the prosperous villain great  Let Cubla judge of Timur by himself  By the high spirit which descends to both  From Eluth's line of kings and he may know  Disgrace unmerited can never damp  The vigour of my soul  CUBLA  Yet still thou bear'st  With tameness which but ill becomes our race  This weight of infamy by Zingis thrown  Upon thee in his wrath  TIMUR  Could Timur break  Thro' honor and his duty he might raise  A flame the billowy Caspian shou'd not quench  But tho' my soul undaunted in the field

unjust not only to his foes  But to his son  TIMUR  My heart with horror shrinks  From such a deed  CUBLA  So feels the feeble mind  That trembles at the thought of arduous deeds  And would impose its fears upon the world  As the effects of virtueGoweak boy  I did advise theeNayI dare do more  Go tell thy father Cubla is his foe  This very night in concert with his friends  He means to prove it but his friends are such  As shudder not at danger  TIMUR  He who doubts  My courage should prepare to rest his hand  Upon his swordNo mortal man but Cubla  Durst thusBut I'm too warmThou said'st to night
