 A LETTER TO A BISHOP c Price ONE SHILLING  A LETTER TO A BISHOP CONCERNING LECTURESHIPS  By F T Assistant CURATE at AND JointLECTURER of St  LONDON Printed for R BALDWIN PaternosterRow T DAVIES RusselStreet Covent Garden MDCCLXVIII  A LETTER c  MY LORD  I Would not thus have address'd your Lordship in public but that in these our days the press is the only method by which I could gain admission to you or have the opportunity to use our old College phrase of a little CONFAB Bishops and Curates are I believe at present seldom seen together except in the prayer for the Clergy Fortune my Lord who brought us so close together at the University where you  may remember we were  Chums  has at length  Saevo laeta negotio  as the old bard sings in one of her strange freaks thrown us from the most intimate connection into stations of life at the utmost distance from each other by making your Lordship a Bishop and me anAssistantCurate I think my Lord I have somewhere read that in the Roman Triumphs a person was always appointed to attend the Conqueror and as he passed along to repeat to him  "Thou art a man"  The following pages may be considered as a salutary hint of the same nature and were only meant to lay on your Lordship's table and as you slip on your lawn to whisper to you  "Thou art a Clergyman"  Tho' I do not to use the phrase of a certain Right Reverend  bask in the Sunshine of the Gospel  you will perceive nowithstanding in the course of this Letter I am not so much hurt by disappointments but that I can laugh at a proper opportunity at present however I am perfectly serious and do from my heart think and declare that the least grateful acknowledgement which our dignified clergy can make for the honours and rewards conferred on them is to assist their distressed brethren to make use of their best endeavours to support the dignity of the ministerial office and to gain them some deference and respect if they  can  or  will  procure them nothing else and yet this my Lord I will not say wherefore or by whom is of late years most shamefully neglected  Your Lordship I am convinc'd by experience is not without humanity I have known some Bishops formerly I mean who had not a grain of it in their whole composition but that is not your case I have therefore taken the liberty to appeal to you in behalf of the inferior clergy of these kingdoms who I believe are the most distressed deserted and despised body of men at present on the face of the earth into the causes of this I propose cooly and candidly to examine and to consult with your Lordship concerning the most probable methods of removing them  I have a thousand things to say to your Lordship on this copious head which I shall reserve for some future occasion and for the sake of method confine myself at present tho' I hate confinement of every kind to a particular branch of  our scanty revenue commonly known by the name of LECTURESHIPS  Your Lordship being much better acquainted with ecclesiastical history than myself could probably acquaint me with the origin and rise of these PAUPERTATIS SUBSIDIA as I am not however very ambitious of tracing the source of this muddy spring I shall defer the search to another opportunity and content myself with observing a truth which I am every day more and more convinced of that the establishment of  Lectureships  in and about London has been extremely prejudicial to the inferior Clergy of this kingdom and contributed in a great measure to bring upon the whole body that poverty and contempt into which they are now fallen that the methods by which they are obtained are highly unbecoming our character and the  means made use of to support them inadequate to the duty performed that they are acquired in short with difficulty lost with ease and very few of them worth the keeping which I will endeavour to prove to your Lordship in as few words as possible  It may not perhaps be improper when I talk of SERMONISERS to follow the usual SERMON method and divide my subject into three or four general heads and tho' I would not as Lord Shaftsbury says  "bring my two's and three's before a fashionable congregation"  yet as I am talking only to your Lordship and what passes may never go much further than ourselves I may as well adopt the TEXTUAL manner there my Lord is a new word for Johnson's Dictionary  I shall proceed therefore  FIRST  To consider how LECTURESHIPS are canvassed for  SECONDLY  What is expected from them And  THIRDLY and LASTLY  How they are paid and what emoluments usually arise to the possessors of them  First therefore my Lord with regard to the  canvassing  for Lectureships as usually practised amongst us I will venture to assert it is an employment utterly inconsistent with the character and unbecoming the dignity of a Clergyman an office greatly beneath the attention of genius and learning and  highly unsuitable to all the notions of life imbibed in the course of a genteel and liberal education  The choice of a LECTURER in this metropolis is generally vested in the whole body of the parish consisting for the most part of ordinary tradesmen sometimes very low mechanics persons not always of the most refined manners or delicate sensations Your Lordship I am sure must remember how cavalierly when we were at Cambridge for which by the by we deserved to be horsewhipped we used to treat the CANAILLE if an honest tradesman came a dunning to our room of a morning before Lecture we tipped the NON DOMI upon him or if by chance he gained admittance and grew importunate in his solicitations without further ceremony shewed him the nearest way  down stairs Little did some of us think what a different behaviour we should one day be obliged to assume towards some of their illustrious brethren in this metropolis  The common people my Lord in this kingdom of liberty are of so combustible a nature that the least point of dispute blows them up into a flame a contest about Churchwardens the choice of a select vestryman or a paltry Lectureship shall set as many sober citizens together by the ears as a County Election To say the truth there is now a days almost as much dirty work practis'd in the Canvassing for one as for the other The Parson as well as the Candidate must play over if he hopes for Success all the little low tricks of bribing the indigent flattering the proud cajoling the rich abusing and calumniating  his antagonist buying making splitting hiding votes the whole catalogue in short of Ministerial Artifices must be practised in the vestry with as little conscience as on the Hustings and a Candidate for St A's Church has almost as much mire to wade through as a Candidate for St S's Chapel  But as I have heard say in WestminsterHall there is nothing like a CASE IN POINT I will therefore treat your Lordship with one to illustrate the subject under consideration and that case to prevent any mistakes shall beMY OWN  Your Lordship I believe may remember the time when my poor Uncle died which obliged me to quit the University and seek my fortune in town where I had not been above three weeks before  I stroll'd one Sunday afternoon into a Church in the City and after service heard the Clerk by order of the Vestry declare the Lectureship of the parish vacant and invite the Clergy however dignify'd or distinguish'd to be Candidates for it and to give in their names by the ensuing Sunday No sooner did I hear this CHURCH SERJEANT thus beating up for recruits than I immediately resolv'd to  enlist  and accordingly the next day waited on the worshipful  Stentor  abovemention'd who took down my name and place of abode on my desiring him at the same time to acquaint me with the best method of proceeding which I was an utter stranger to he advised me as a friend to apply as speedily as possible to Mr a Cheesemonger in Lane who was then first Churchwarden a leading man in the Vestry and a person he assur'd me  on whom the Election would in a great measure depend I took honest AMEN'S advice and by nine the next morning not I must own without some reluctance dressed myself as well as I could and waited on Mr Churchwarden As soon as he saw me enter the Shop in my Canonicals for I had hired an excellent new gown and cassock behind St Clement's on the occasion he made me a very low bow gave me the title of Doctor and imagining no doubt that I was come to bespeak cheeses for the country begg'd to know my  honour  's commands to which I replied in an humble tone and looking extremely disconcerted that I came to wait on him on account of the Lectureship of the parish and begg'd the favor of his vote and interest c Your Lordship I am sure would have smiled to see the sudden alteration of his features and behaviour he dropp'd  all the tradesman's obsequiousness and in a moment assumed the magisterial air and dignity of a Churchwarden turn'd aside to a woman who was just then asking for a pound of Cheshire and without addressing himself to me cry'd out  "this is the fourth parson I have had with me today on the same errand"  then staring me full in the face  "well young man says he you intend to be a Candidate for this same Lecture you are all to mount the NOSTRUM I suppose and merit will carry it for my part I promise nobody but remember I tell you beforehand I am for  voice  and  action  so mind your hits"  When he had said this he immediately turn'd upon his heel and went into the Countinghouse I took my leave in an awkward manner as you may suppose being not a little chagrin'd at his insolence and as I went  out of the shop overheard his Lady observing from behind the counter that I was a pretty SPRIG of DIVINITY but look'd a little SHEEPISH and had not half the courage of the gentleman that had been recommended to her husband by MR SQUINTUM  The instant I quitted the sign of the CheshireCheese I laid aside all thoughts of further solicitation and resolved to return to college and live on making Fellowcommoner's exercises rather than subject myself any more to such mortifying indignities Good God thought I to myself is this the fruit of my studies this the reward of all my toil and labour in the university to have the important point whether I shall eat or starve at last determin'd by a CHEESEMONGER who declares for VOICE and ACTION  In spite notwithstanding of this resolution for resolutions your Lordship knows are much easier made than kept I was obliged in less than six months having during that time taken it into my head to fall in love and marry to repair once more to the great city and put into the Ecclesiastical lottery where by the by as in most other lotteries you buy so dear meet with so few prizes and run so much hazard that none but desperado's ought to venture in them there my Lord I renew'd my solicitations and experienced all the miseries and misfortunes all the insults and indignities which the pride and insolence of the rich both Laity and Clergy inflict on their dependent brethren the difficulties which I met with in search of a  Lectureship  for that was my  Summum Bonum  are inconceivable and I can assure your Lordship that trifling as the emoluments  are of this preferment all the perfections of human nature united are scarce sufficient to a man without personal interest to insure his success The variety of distresses which I encountered from the different tempers and dispositions of the  Gentlemen  and  Ladies  for so I was obliged to call them who had votes in the parish the mean and abject flattery which I was forc'd to make use of with the many frequent affronts and disappointments I underwent would swell half a melancholy volume Without enumerating the necessary accomplishments generally expected on these occasions of drinking hard with the husbands and saying soft things to their wives in more parishes than one my Lord where I have been a Candidate to smoak your half dozen of pipes and drink two bottles at a sitting are infinitely more necessary perfections than  any which you cou'd bring with you from the University and it is a maxim with many good citizens that unless you are what they call a dd honest fellow you can never be a good preacher or an Orthodox Divine in short my Lord and to be serious unless a poor Clergyman is every thing that he ought  not  to be he can never be what is every man's wish independent  I must not in this place forget to mention one rock which young Divines are perpetually splitting on in this voyage and that is Party a Candidate must take great care how he repeats his  political Creed  as if he declares himself on  one  side he will inevitably be opposed slander'd and insulted by the  other  it behoves him therefore always to join with the strongest but what is worst of all if he is of no side which  your Lordship well knows is the most prudent way it is a million to one if he is suffered to continue so  I remember my Lord when I set up for the Lectureship of St the political Thermometer of the parish was very high I had at that time and retain to this moment the utmost contempt for all parties being satisfied as every man of common understanding must be that there is nothing but selfinterest at the bottom of them it was very difficult however I found to persuade other men that I was not as foolish as themselves  Mr Alderman Grub and Mr Deputy Clove the two leading men in the parish were at that time or at least professed to be of opposite principles the Alderman a staunch Whig the Deputy a reputed Tory I waited on them both  for their votes and interest the consequence of which was that I succeded with neither both reproaching me with being of a different way of thinking from themselves The Alderman was extremely sorry he could not serve me he had a regard he had heard he admired c but to be plain with me he was assured I had drank tea at the Deputy's and when I went to the Deputy for  my  part I shall never forget it my Lord to my dying day  "for my part said he I am of no side I despise all parties whatsomdever but there are people whom some people can't like like other people in short I shall always be glad to see you whilst you are what you are but remember Mr Parson if ever you dine with Alderman Grub againyou understand meyour humble servant"  These my Lord are but an inconsiderable part of the miseries and indignities which a poor  Parson  is sure to encounter with on this occasion but half  the spurns  Which patient merit from th' unworthy takes  For my own part I cannot but think the very single circumstance of trapesing about from door to door in one's  Canonicals  perhaps for a week is sufficient to deter any man who has the least regard for cleanliness and decorum from canvassing for a  City Lectureship  There is not in nature a more ridiculous sight than a draggletail Divine holding up his spatter'd  Sacerdotals  and dabbling thro' dirty streets and blind alleys in search of  Civic  preferment  And now I am upon this head my Lord you must pardon me  A SHORT DIGRESSION CONCERNING GOWNS and CASSOCKS  A certain right reverend Prelate now with God that I think my Lord is the phrase when we speak of  departed Episcopacy  had amongst other reforming schemes entertain'd a design of obliging all the Clergy and especially those of the Metropolis to appear constantly in their proper  Uniform  and on no account permitting them to be seen in public without a  gown  and  cassock  of what service this reformation cou'd possibly be to religion and virtue I must own I could never discover whilst the inconveniences attending it to the poor Clergy are sufficiently obvious It has been said I know by the advocates for this plan that whenever a  Clergyman  appears  as such  he will always meet with the respect due to his function and that  if he is not treated with civility he may thank  himself  for it but let us examine a little and see if  these things are so  You my Lord I make no doubt meet with all the deference and respect which are due to your exalted station and character but I must beg your Lordship not to attribute it to wrong motives or imagine that the bows made to you in the street are a tribute to your  rose  and  bever  the incense I assure your Lordship is offered to the  mitre  only The reverence is not paid to you as a pastor of the flock of Christ it is your  temporal  and not your  spiritual  dignity that attracts the attention and commands the homage of the multitude it is not because you have three thousand souls under your care but that you have three thousand pounds per Annum I have read my Lord and do verily believe that there  was a time tho' not within our memory when the  Clergy  of all ranks dignify'd or undignify'd met with some degree of respect as such even in this kingdom but those days are gone and past and so very different are the manners of this age that I would venture one of my best sermons against your Lordship's last new gown and cassock we philosophers my Lord consider one another's wants that if your Lordship when you go next to the House of Peers will step out of your chariot at Charingcross without your purplefring'd gloves your footman behind or any other external mark that might betray your quality you shall walk from thence to Palaceyard without being once oblig'd to pull off your hat in return for any compliments paid to your  cloth  Nobody my Lord in these our days takes any notice of a  gown  and  cassock  except perhaps  a parish girl a chimneysweeper's boy who salutes you as a  brother black  or now and then a common soldier who does not know as Chaplains seldom attend but you may belong to  his  regiment On the other hand it is at least forty to one that you meet with some gross affront before you get half way 'tis odds but a hackney coachman gives his horses a lick as soon as he sees you splashes you all over and then winks to his brother with  "Smoke the Doctor's new cassock"  Add to this that if you don't give the wall to every tinker and taylor you meet you will be call'd a  proud priest  if you happen to be  fat  they will be sure to say you have got the  church  in your  belly  if you walk fastyou are in a dd hurry for your dinnerif you go slow and pick your way it is  "mind Parson Prim how gingerly he steps"  If your gown is draggled  a carman will call out to you to hold up your  petticoats  and if you chance to turn up an alley on any necessary occasion the witticisms upon you are innumerable for after all my Lord it is a strange thing and what all the world wonders at that  Parsons  should eat and drink and sleep and do a hundred vulgar things just like other men  And now my Lord do you seriously think it would be any advantage or contribute to the honor and dignity of the cloth to be for ever  scarfed  and  cassocked  in the streets of London for my own part till I am forced to do otherwise I shall content myself with sculking unnotic'd in my iron grey as whilst I am mistaken for a parish clerk a grazier or an undertaker I may at least escape without ridicule and abuse  which if I appear in my  regimentals  as things are now circumstanced I can never expect  But to return to my subject or as we say every Sunday to proceed to my  second  head and consider  What is expected from  Lecturers  and how they are generally treated when they become so Let us now then suppose that the poor Candidate after going through all these fiery trials should at length be so fortunate as to make his calling and election sure behold him chosen licensed and  Inpulpited  there my Lord is another new word for you and I see no reason why it is not as good as  Install'd  he will find that  seat  or rather  standing  of honor a  "painful preeminence"  for as high as he may  there imagine himself not a creature who sits  below  but thinks himself far  above  him Every man that gave you his vote will consider you from that day forth and as long as you continue in that situation as his inferior he looks upon himself as one of your  feeders  to whom you are indebted for your  daily bread  and therefore expects you will honor him accordingly and for this special reason because if  you  withdraw your  complaisance he  may withdraw his  Subscription  But let us attend a little to the precarious tenure on which he holds his new preferment When a man is in peaceable possession of a good living scarce any body takes notice of his preaching It matters very little whether he is as elegant as  The reader is desired to fill up these blank spaces with the names of the best and worst Preacher he is acquainted with  or  as contemptible as Dr But with a  Lecturer  the case is extremely different he is considered by his hearers as a kind of Divinitycook and is expected like other cooks to adapt every thing to every body's palate and let him have ever so much merit 'tis a hundred to one he does not please one in a hundred for it is all whim and caprice If he has a loud voice perhaps he may be called a Brawler he takes too much pains labours and so forth if he is weak and low he is censur'd as spiritless and inanimate if his action is slow and solemn he shall be termed listless and indolent if it be strong and vary'd it shall be called vehement and theatrical for the poor judges he is talking to never consider the different subjects to be treated that one may require sober and composed behaviour in the utterance another lively spirited and diffused gesture  In most other professions those who apply for your aid and instruction will at least allow you some knowledge in your  own  business and have complaisance enough to suppose you have a tolerable idea of and acquaintance with the matter of it but in  Divinity  it is quite otherwise every Auditor in a church is as good a judge or at least thinks himself so both of the subject and the manner of treating it as yourself and will not fail to shew his judgment with regard to stile sentiment and delivery though he knows no more of either than the desk you write upon  They will tell you the Sermon you preached was borrowed from  another  when it is really your  own  and vice versâ compliment you upon it as your  own  when it is every word of it stolen from  another  The following my Lord is a fact which happened to myself  Being engaged one whole week in writing an answer to a political Pamphlet against the D of N for which I had twenty pieces more by the by than I got by preaching in a twelvemonth I ventured on the Saturday night to transcribe a discourse of Tillotson's and preached it on the Sunday morning to a very polite audience on my coming out of church I was saluted by one of the Overseers with  "thank you Doctor for your excellent Sermon but let me tell you 'twas a dangerous topic for a young man to be sure you might have treated it a little more fully  observe his complaisance  but upon the whole it was really a good discourse and I am sure all your own but I remember a glorious one of  Tillotson's on that very subject I rememberthat you do not indeed my friend replied I I could not help it my Lord for the life of me for the sermon you just now heard is the very same word for word I assure you and you will find it when you go home Vol and pageso and so"  But let a man preach his  own  sermons or any body's else he can never expect to please for any length of time I have scarce ever known a Lecturer continue a favourite above two or three years if he always preaches himself he grows tiresome and if he puts in another he is censured as idle and negligent if his Deputy preaches better or which is the same thing  appears  to preach better than himself it sinks the principal into contempt and if the Deputy does not preach so well hints are given him that it  would be better if some folks would do their own duty add to this that your constant Churchtrotters and Textmarkers who take down the heads in their pocketbooks are always smoaking your stale divinity and expect a new discourse to tickle their ears every Sunday We can see the same play at the theatre hear the same story abroad or read the same book at home perhaps once in a month at least with pleasure but to listen to the same discourse from a pulpit once in three years though perhaps we do not actually remember a line more than the text is for what reason I know not most intolerable  I am as throughly convinced as I am of my own Existence that  Lectureships  greatly promote and increase  Methodism  A desire of striking out something new and uncommon  to tickle the ears of  the Groundlings  has led many a plain wellmeaning preacher into romantic sallies and theatrical gestures and insensibly drawn them into methodistical rant and enthusiasm  There never was a duller hound than that  The  Servitors  as they are termed at  Oxford  or what we call in Cambridge  Sizers  go at  King's College  and there only by the name of  Hounds  Mr Jones was a  hound of King's  hound  of King's whom your Lordship must remember as well as myself the famous  Mr Jones  of St Saviour's he had preached for some time in the old Dogtrot stile of First to the First Secondly to the Second and adminster'd his gentle soporifics to no purpose for a year or two when finding it would not do all on a sudden he shook his ears set up a loud bark and by mere dint of noise vociferation and grimace mouth'd  and bellow'd himself into reputation amongst the gentlemen of the  Clink  outheroded Herod and almost eclips'd the fame of Wesley Whitfield and Madan  I shall now proceed my Lord to speak in the  Parsonic  stile to my  third general head  viz the manner in which Lectureships are usually paid which is equally injurious to our character and function  I know a little too much of the world my Lord to expect that a Parson should be paid like a Firstrate Player a Pimp or a Lord of the Treasury whose incomes I believe are pretty near equal but at the same time cannot help thinking that a labourer in the Vineyard is as well worthy of his hire as a Journeyman Carpenter Mason c and has as good  a right to two pound two on a Sunday as he has on a Saturday night and yet not one in a hundred of us is paid in that proportion  The Lecturer's box generally goes about with the rest of the parish Beggars a little after Christmas and every body throws in their charity for it is always considered in that light as they think proper Were I to tell your Lordship how many paltry excuses are made to evade this little annual tribute by the mean and sordid how very little is given even by the most generous and what an inconsiderable sum the whole generally amounts to the recital would not afford you much entertainment and for aught I know might even give you some small concern  You cannot imagine my Lord with what an envious eye we poor Lecturers have often looked over a Waiter's book at a Coffeehouse where I have seen such a collection of guineas and half guineas as made my mouth water to give less than a crown at least would be to the last degree ungenteel for the immense trouble of handing a dish of coffee or a newspaper whilst the poor Divine who has toil'd in the Ministry for a Twelvemonth and half worn out a pair of excellent lungs in the unprofitable service shall think himself well rewarded with the noble donation of  half a crown  But to illustrate my subject I will give your Lordship another story there is nothing like a little painting from the life on these occasions suppose yourself then my Lord an eyewitness of the  following scene which passed not long since in a certain part of this Metropolis  Enter the Churchwarden and Overseer into the shop of Mr Prim the MercerWell Mr Twist what are your commands with mewe are come to wait on your honor with the Lecturer'sbook Sira voluntary subscription of the inhabitants of the parish of St for the support ofwell well you need not read any further what is itwhatever you please SirAye here's another load another burthen d'ye think I am made of gold there's the poor's rate the doctor's rate the window rates the devil's in the rates I thinkhowever I can't refuse  you  but I'll not give another yearhere Buckram reach me half a crown out of the tillyour Servant Madam  A Lady comes out of a back parlour walks thro' the shop and gets into a chair  Aye there's another taxa guinea for two box tickets as sure as the benefit comes round for my wife and daughter besides chairhire    Twist  shakes his head  O master Prim master Prim had not you better now have given us a guinea for the Doctor and his four children and reserved your half crown for the Lady who if I may judge from her garb and equipage does not want it half so much as the poor  Parson  but you will be in the fashion so give us your mite set down Mr Prim two and sixpenceSir good morrow to yougentlemen your servant  Such my Lord you see is the force of fashion and such the influence of example  that a constant Churchgoer and one perhaps who fancies himself a very good Christian shall throw away  one pound one  with all the pleasure imaginable for an evening's entertainment at the theatre and at the same time grudge  half a crown  for two and fifty discourses from the pulpit which if he turns to his arithmetic book he will see amounts to aboutthree farthings a sermonand a sober Citizen too as Lady Townly says fye fye  These my Lord are melancholy truths and though you and I who are philosophers may laugh at them have made many an honest man's heart ake  I will leave your Lordship to imagine without entering any further into this subject what the great and desireable emoluments must be arising from a  TownLectureship  hardly equal at the best to the wages of a Journeyman Staymaker and by no means upon a level with the profits of drawers coffeehouse waiters or the footmen of our nobility This very lucrative employment notwithstanding as being too considerable for one man is frequently split in two and divided like the places of Postmaster General Secretary c amongst the great I have myself the honor my Lord of being what is called a  JointLecturer  not having interest enough in the parish where I had been  Curate  for twenty years to secure the whole I cannot indeed so far agree with our old friend Hesiod as to think    the half better than the whole but embracing the  Half a loaf is better than no bread  English instead of the  Greek proverb sit myself down contentedly and eat my  half loaf  in quiet But to confess the truth I find the profits of both preferments for your Lordship sees I am a  pluralist  rather too small to provide in these hard times for the necessities of a growing family and have lately been obliged to  eke out  matters by entering myself on my friend Hw's list As there is something curious in this Mr H both with regard to himself and the business he is engaged in I shall beg leave to introduce him to your Lordship's acquaintance as I believe during what I may call your  minority  in the  Church  no such character or occupation was in being  You must know then my Lord that the ingenious Mr H has found out a new method of being serviceable to the  Clergy  and himself by keeping a  kind of  Ecclesia  ical Registeroffice  or more properly speaking a  Divinityshop  in the city where  Parsons  are  hired  by the day week month c as occasion requires For this purpose he keeps a regular alphabetical list of unemploy'd  Divines  from the age of threescore and ten to two and twenty ready to be  let out  for certain stipulated sums deducting a proper  premium  for the  agent  from every one of them If any labouring  Curate Lecturer Morningpreacher  c is too busy or too idle to perform his own duty he may immediately repair to the said office and be supplied with as much sound and orthodox divinity as he is able or willing to pay for To this very useful Gentleman I had myself not long since occasion to apply being obliged to leave my  Church  for a fortnight when the following conversation as near as I can remember pass'd between  us if it does not make you smile I can only say your Lordship's risible muscles are not so pliant as they used to be  Curate  Mr H your Servant  Mr H  Doctor your's  Curate  I suppose Mr H you can guess my errand I am going out of town tomorrow and shall want a supply and withal master H I come to inform you I shall commence from this day both  agent  and  patient  and intend to hire and to be hired so as I am likely to be a pretty constant dealer and am besides an old acquaintance hope you will give me the turn of the scale so put me down in your list immediately  Mr H  pulling out the list  It shall be done Sir and a most respectable  list  it is I assure you I have just got a fresh cargo of  Scotch Divines  piping hot from  Edinburgh  besides the old corpsmy collection ends withlet me seefourteen Schoolmasters five Doctors of Divinity pray my Lord mind the  Climax  two Reviewers three political writers two biblemakers and a K's Cn  Curate  All men of erudition I suppose  Mr H  Excellent scholars and charming preachers I assure you but  entre nous  not one of them worth sixpence in the worldbut to your business  Curate  Aye Mr H I must have a good voice for  Wednesdays  and  Fridays  and one of your best Orators for  Sunday  next you know  my  congregation is a little delicate  Mr H  Aye more nice than wise perhapsbut let us look sharphere's  Parson Rawbones  one of my  Athletic  ablebodied divines it is not long since he knock'd down a clerk in the desk for interrupting him in the middle of a prayer this you know shew'd a good spirit and keeps up the  dignity  of the  cloth  but I doubt whether he'll do for  you  for he's a  Northcountry man  and has got the  Burr  in his throat he'll never pass at  your  end of the town I shall sport him however at a  Daylecture  or an early  Sacrament  Curate  You are so facetious Mr H but pray find me out somebody for I am in haste  Mr H  If you had wanted a brawler for a charity sermon I could have help'd you to the best  beggar  in  England  an arrant pickpocket  for the  Middle isle  beats your D's and W's out of the pit a Doctor of Divinity too and a Justice of peace but he wont do for  you  for the dog's over head and ears in debt and durst not stir out on a weekday for fear of the Bumbailiffs but stayhere I have him for youthe quickest reader in  England  I'll bet my  Stackhouse  's bible to a  commonprayer  book he gives Dr  Drawl  to the TeDeum and overtakes him before he comes to the Thanksgiving O he's a  rare hand  at a Collect but remember if he preaches you must furnish him with the  Paraphernalia  for he's but just got upon the list and has not money enough yet to purchase  Canonicals  Curate  O we can equip him with  them  but what's his price  Mr H  whispers  Why you would not offer him less  thanfor the sake of your brethren for your own sake Let me tell you Sir I am one of the best friends to the inferior  Clergy  and have done more for them and that's a bold word than the whole bench of Bp's I believe I may safely say I have rais'd the price of  Lungs  at least  Cent per Cent  I knew the time and so did you when a well cassock'd Divine was glad to read prayers and on a holiday too for twelvepence Old C never had more in his life now Sir I never let a  tit  go out of  my  stable you'll pardon my jocularity under five shillings  My friend H was running on in this unmerciful manner and would for aught I know have talk'd to this time if I had not stopp'd him short pretended immediate business paid my earnest  and took my leave not a little chagrin'd you may imagine at the contemptuous kindness he express'd for the  cloth  and the degrading familiarity with which he treated that  function  to which your Lordship equally with myself has the honor to belong  To say the truthBut this must be deferr'd with many other considerations to  another letter  my wife having just now broke into my study to remind me that I have a sermon to finish before  ten  tomorrow which will scarce give me time to subscribe myself  MY LORD  YOUR LORDSHIP'S most obedient c F T
