 THE TEMPLE OF FAME  Price One Shilling  The Temple of Fame  L  Cheron inv  Sam  l  Gribelin Jun  r  Sculp  THE TEMPLE OF FAME A VISION  By Mr  POPE  THE SECOND EDITION  LONDON  Printed for BERNARD LINTOTT between the two  TempleGates  in  Fleetstreet    Advertisement  _THE Hint of the following Piece was taken from  Chaucer  's  House of Fame  The Design is in a manner entirely alter'd the Descriptions and most of the particular Thoughts my own Yet I could not suffer it to be printed without this Acknowledgment or think a Concealment of this Nature the less unfair for being common The Reader who would compare this with  Chaucer  may begin with his Third Book of  Fame  there being nothing in the Two first Books that answers to their Title  THE TEMPLE OF FAME  _IN that soft Season when descending Showers  Call forth the Greens and wake the rising Flowers  When opening Buds salute the welcome Day  And Earth relenting feels the Genial Ray  As balmy Sleep had charm'd my Cares to Rest  And Love it self was banish'd from my Breast  What Time the Morn mysterious Visions brings  While purer Slumber spread their golden Wings  A Train of Phantoms in wild Order rose  And join'd this Intellectual Scene compose  I stood methought betwixt Earth Seas and Skies  The whole Creation open to my Eyes  In Air selfbalanc'd hung the Globe below  Where Mountains rise and circling Oceans flow  Here naked Rocks and empty Wastes were seen  There tow'ry Cities and the Forests green  Here sailing Ships delight the wand'ring Eyes  There Trees and intermingl'd Temples rise  Now a clear Sun the shining Scene displays  The transient Landscape now in Clouds decays  O'er the wide Prospect as I gaz'd around  Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous Sound  Like broken Thunders that at distance roar  Or Billows murm'ring on the hollow Shoar  Then gazing up a glorious Pile beheld  Whose tow'ring Summit ambient Clouds conceal'd  High on a Rock of Ice the Structure lay  Steep its Ascent and slipp'ry was the Way  The wond'rous Rock like  Parian  Marble shone  And seem'd to distant Sight of solid Stone  Inscriptions here of various Names I view'd  The greater Part by hostile Time subdu'd  Yet wide was spread their Fame in Ages past  And Poets once had promis'd they should last  Some fresh engrav'd appear'd of Wits renown'd  I look'd again nor cou'd their Trace be found  Criticks I saw that others Names deface  And fix their own with Labour in their place  Their own like others soon their Place resign'd  Or disappear'd and left the first behind  Nor was the Work impair'd by Storms alone  But felt th' Approaches of too warm a Sun  For Fame impatient of Extreams decays  Not more by Envy than Excess of Praise  Yet Part no Injuries of Heav'n cou'd feel  Like Crystal faithful to the graving Steel  The Rock's high Summit in the Temple's Shade  Nor Heat could melt nor beating Storm invade  There Names inscrib'd unnumber'd Ages past  From Time's first Birth with Time it self shall last  These ever new nor subject to Decays  Spread and grow brighter with the Length of Days  So  Zembla  's Rocks the beauteous Work of Frost  Rise white in Air and glitter o'er the Coast  Pale Suns unfelt at distance roll away  And on th' impassive Ice the Lightnings play  Eternal Snows the growing Mass supply  Till the bright Mountains prop th' incumbent Sky  As  Atlas  fix'd each hoary Pile appears  The gather'd Winter of a thousand Years  On this Foundation  Fame  's high Temple stands  Stupendous Pile not rear'd by mortal Hands  Whate'er proud  Rome  or artful  Greece  beheld  Or elder  Babylon  its Frame excell'd  Four Faces had the Dome and ev'ry Face  Of various Structure but of equal Grace  Four brazen Gates on Columns lifted high  Salute the diff'rent Quarters of the Sky  Here fabled Chiefs in darker Ages born  Or Worthies old whom Arms or Arts adorn  Who Cities rais'd or tam'd a monstrous Race  The fourfold Walls in breathing Statues grace  Heroes in animated Marble frown  And Legislators seem to think in Stone  Westward a sumptuous Frontispiece appear'd  On Dorick Pillars of white Marble rear'd  Crown'd with an Architrave of antique Mold  And Sculpture rising on the roughen'd Gold  In shaggy Spoils here  Theseus  was beheld  And  Perseus  dreadful with  Minerva  's Shield  There great  Alcides  stooping with his Toil  Rests on his Club and holds th'  Hesperian  Spoil  Here  Orpheus  sings Trees moving to the Sound  Start from their Roots and form a Shade around  Amphion  there the loud creating Lyre  Strikes and beholds a sudden  Thebes  aspire  Cythaeron  's Ecchoes answer'd to his Call  And half the Mountain roll'd into a Wall  There might you see the length'ning Spires ascend  The Domes swell up the widening Arches bend  The growing Tow'rs like Exhalations rise  And the huge Columns heave into the Skies  The Eastern Front was glorious to behold  With Diamond flaming and  Barbarick  Gold  There  Ninus  shone who spread th'  Assyrian  Fame  And the great Founder of the  Persian  Name  There in long Robes the Royal  Magi  stand  Grave  Zoroaster  waves the circling Wand  The sage  Chaldaeans  rob'd in White appear'd  And  Brachmans  deep in desert Woods rever'd  These stop'd the Moon and call'd th' unbody'd Shades  To Midnight Banquets in the glimm'ring Glades  Made visionary Fabricks round them rise  And airy Spectres skim before their Eyes  Of  Talismans  and  Sigils  knew the Pow'r  And careful watch'd the Planetary Hour  Superior and alone  Confucius  stood  Who taught that useful Science to be  good  But on the South a long Majestick Race  Of  Aegypt  's Priests the gilded Niches grace  Who measur'd Earth describ'd the starry Spheres  And trac'd the long Records of Lunar Years  High on his Car  Sesostris  struck my View  Whom scepter'd Slaves in golden Harness drew  His Hands a Bow and pointed Jav'lin hold  His Giant Limbs are arm'd in Scales of Gold  Between the Statues Obelisks were plac'd  And the learn'd Walls with Hieroglyphicks grac'd  Of  Gothick  Structure was the Northern Side  O'erwrought with Ornaments of barb'rous Pride  There huge Colosses rose with Trophies crown'd  And  Runick  Characters were grav'd around  There sate  Zamolxis  with erected Eyes  And  Odin  here in mimick Trances dies  There on rude Iron Columns smear'd with Blood  The horrid Forms of  Scythian  Heroes stood  Druids  and  Bards  their once loud Harps unstrung  And Youths that dy'd to be by Poets sung  These and a thousand more of doubtful Fame  To whom old Fables gave a lasting Name  In Ranks adorn'd the Temple's outward Face  The Wall in Lustre and Effect like Glass  Which o'er each Object casting various Dies  Enlarges some and others multiplies  Nor void of Emblem was the mystick Wall  For thus Romantick Fame increases all  The Temple shakes the sounding Gates unfold  Wide Vaults appear and Roofs of fretted Gold  Rais'd on a thousand Pillars wreath'd around  With LawrelFoliage and with Eagles crown'd  Of bright transparent Beryl were the Walls  The Freezes Gold and Gold the Capitals  As Heaven with Stars the Roof with Jewels glows  And ever living Lamps depend in Rows  Full in the Passage of each spacious Gate  The sage Historians in white Garments wait  Grav'd o'er their Seats the Form of  Time  was found  His Scythe revers'd and both his Pinions bound  Within stood Heroes who thro' loud Alarms  In bloody Fields pursu'd Renown in Arms  High on a Throne with Trophies charg'd I view'd  The  Youth  that all things but himself subdu'd  His Feet on Sceptres and  Tiara  's trod  And his horn'd Head express'd the  Libyan  God  There  Caesar  grac'd with both  Minerva  's shone  Caesar  the World's great Master and his own  Unmov'd superior still in every State  And scarce detested in his Country's Fate  But chief were those who not for Empire fought  But with their Toils their People's Safety bought  High o'er the rest  Epaminondas  stood  Timoleon  glorious in his Brother's Blood  And  Scipio  Saviour of the  Roman  State  Great in his Triumphs in Retirement great  Here too the Wise and Good their Honours claim  Muchsuff'ring Heroes of less noisy Fame  Fair Virtue's silent Train Supreme of these  Here ever shines the Godlike  Socrates  Here triumphs He whom  Athens  did expel  In all things Just but when he sign'd the Shell  Here his Abode the martyr'd  Phocion  claims  With  Agis  not the last of  Spartan  Names  Unconquer'd  Cato  shews the Wound he tore  And  Brutus  his ill Genius meets no more  But in the Centre of the hallow'd Quire  Six pompous Column's o'er the rest aspire  Around the Shrine it self of  Fame  they stand  Hold the chief Honours and the Fane command  High on the first the mighty  Homer  shone  Eternal Adamant compos'd his Throne  Father of Verse in holy Fillets drest  His Silver Beard wav'd gently o'er his Breast  Tho' blind a Boldness in his Looks appears  In Years he seem'd but not impair'd by Years  The Wars of  Troy  were round the Pillar seen  Here fierce  Tydides  wounds the  Cyprian  Queen  Here  Hector  glorious from  Patroclus  Fall  Here dragg'd in Triumph round the  Trojan  Wall  Motion and Life did ev'ry Part inspire  Bold was the Work and prov'd the Master's Fire  A strong Expression most he seem'd t'affect  And here and there disclos'd a brave Neglect  A Golden Column next in Rank appear'd  On which a Shrine of purest Gold was rear'd  Finish'd the whole and labour'd ev'ry Part  With patient Touches of unweary'd Art  The  Mantuan  there in sober Triumph sate  Compos'd his Posture and his Look sedate  On  Homer  still he fix'd a reverend Eye  Great without Pride in modest Majesty  In living Sculpture on the Sides were spread  The  Latian  Wars and haughty  Turnus  dead  Eliza  stretch'd upon the fun'ral Pyre  Aeneas  bending with his aged Sire  Troy  flam'd in burnish'd Gold and o'er the Throne  Arms and the Man  in Golden Cyphers shone  Four Swans sustain a Carr of Silver bright  With Heads advanc'd and Pinions stretch'd for Flight  Here like some furious Prophet  Pindar  rode  And seem'd to labour with th' inspiring God  Across the Harp a careless Hand he flings  And boldly sinks into the sounding Strings  The figur'd Games of  Greece  the Column grace  Neptune  and  Jove  survey the rapid Race  The Youth's hang o'er their Chariots as they run  The fiery Steeds seem starting from the Stone  The Champions in distorted Postures threat  And all appear'd Irregularly great  Here happy  Horace  tun'd th'  Ausonian  Lyre  To sweeter Sounds and temper'd  Pindar  's Fire  Pleas'd with  Alcaeus  manly Rage t'infuse  The softer Spirit of the  Sapphick  Muse  The polish'd Pillar different Sculptures grace  A Work outlasting Monumental Brass  Here smiling  Loves  and  Bacchanals  appear  The  Julian  Star and Great  Augustus  here  The Doves that round the Infant Poet spread  Myrtles and Bays hung hov'ring o'er his Head  Here in a Shrine that cast a dazling Light  Sate fix'd in Thought the mighty  Stagyrite  His Sacred Head a radiant Zodiack crown'd  And various Animals his Sides surround  His piercing Eyes erect appear to view  Superior Worlds and look all Nature thro'  With equal Rays immortal  Tully  shone  The  Roman Rostra  deck'd the Consul's Throne  Gath'ring his flowing Robe he seem'd to stand  In Act to speak and graceful stretch'd his Hand  Behind  Rome  's  Genius  waits with  Civick  Crowns  And the Great Father of his Country owns  These massie Columns in a Circle rise  O'er which a pompous Dome invades the Skies  Scarce to the Top I stretch'd my aking Sight  So large it spread and swell'd to such a Height  Full in the midst proud  Fame  's Imperial Seat  With Jewels blaz'd magnificently great  The vivid Em'ralds there revive the Eye  The flaming Rubies shew their sanguine Dye  Bright azure Rays from lively Saphirs stream  And lucid Amber casts a Golden Gleam  With variouscolour'd Lights the Pavement shone  And all on fire appear'd the glowing Throne  The Dome's high Arch reflects the mingled Blaze  And forms a Rainbow of alternate Rays  When on the  Goddess  first I cast my Sight  Scarce seem'd her Stature of a Cubit's height  But swell'd to larger Size the more I gaz'd  Till to the Roof her tow'ring Front she rais'd  With her the Temple ev'ry Moment grew  And ampler  Vista's  open'd to my View  Upward the Columns shoot the Roofs ascend  And Arches widen and long Iles extend  Such was her Form as antient Bards have told  Wings raise her Arms and Wings her Feet infold  A Thousand busy Tongues the Goddess bears  And Thousand open Eyes and Thousand list'ning Ears  Beneath in Order rang'd the tuneful Nine  Her Virgin Handmaids still attend the Shrine  With Eyes on Fame for ever fix'd they sing  For Fame they raise the Voice and tune the String  With Time's first Birth began the Heav'nly Lays  And last Eternal thro' the Length of Days  Around these Wonders as I cast a Look  The Trumpet sounded and the Temple shook  And all the Nations summon'd at the Call  From diff'rent Quarters fill the crowded Hall  Of various Tongues the mingled Sounds were heard  In various Garbs promiscuous Throngs appear'd  Thick as the Bees that with the Spring renew  Their flow'ry Toils and sip the fragrant Dew  When the wing'd Colonies first tempt the Sky  O'er dusky Fields and shaded Waters fly  Or settling seize the Sweets the Blossoms yield  And a low Murmur runs along the Field  Millions of suppliant Crowds the Shrine attend  And all Degrees before the Goddess bend  The Poor the Rich the Valiant and the Sage  And boasting Youth and Narrative old Age  Their Pleas were diff'rent their Request the same  For Good and Bad alike are fond of Fame  Some she disgrac'd and some with Honours crown'd  Unlike Successes equal Merits found  Thus her blind Sister fickle  Fortune  reigns  And undiscerning scatters Crowns and Chains  First at the Shrine the Learned World appear  And to the Goddess thus prefer their Prayer  Long have we sought t'instruct and please Mankind  With Studies pale with Midnight Vigils blind  But thank'd by few rewarded yet by none  We here appeal to thy superior Throne  On Wit and Learning the just Prize bestow  For  Fame  is all we must expect below  The Goddess heard and bade the Muses raise  The Golden Trumpet of eternal Praise  From Pole to Pole the Winds diffuse the Sound  That fills the Circuit of the World around  Not all at once as Thunder breaks the Cloud  The Notes at first were rather sweet than loud  By just degrees they ev'ry moment rise  Fill the wide Earth and gain upon the Skies  At ev'ry Breath were balmy Odours shed  Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread  Less fragrant Scents th' unfolding Rose exhales  Or Spices breathing in  Arabian  Gales  Next these the Good and Just an awful Train  Thus on their Knees address'd the sacred Fane  Since living Virtue is with Envy curst  And the best Men are treated like the worst  Do thou just Goddess call our Merits forth  And give each Deed th' exact intrinsic Worth  Not with bare Justice shall your Act be crown'd  Said Fame but high above Desert renown'd  Let fuller Notes th' applauding World amaze  And the loud Clarion labour in your Praise  This Band dismiss'd behold another Crowd  Prefer'd the same Request and lowly bow'd  The constant Tenour of whose well spent Days  No less deserv'd a just Return of Praise  But strait the direful Trump of Slander sounds  Thro' the big Dome the doubling Thunder bounds  Loud as the Burst of Cannon rends the Skies  The dire Report thro' ev'ry Region flies  In ev'ry Ear incessant Rumours rung  And gath'ring Scandals grew on ev'ry Tongue  From the black Trumpet's rusty Concave broke  Sulphureous Flames and Clouds of rolling Smoke  The pois'nous Vapor blots the purple Skies  And withers all before it as it flies  A Troop came next who Crowns and Armour wore  And proud Defiance in their Looks they bore  For thee they cry'd amidst Alarms and Strife  We sail'd in Tempests down the Stream of Life  For thee whole Nations fill'd with Flames and Blood  And swam to Empire thro' the purple Flood  Those Ills we dar'd thy Inspiration own  And all that Virtue seem'd was done for thee alone  Ambitious Fools the Queen reply'd and frown'd  Be all your Acts in dark Oblivion crown'd  There sleep forgot with mighty Tyrants gone  Your Statues moulder'd and your Names unknown  A sudden Cloud strait snatch'd them from my Sight  And each Majestick Phantom sunk in Night  Then came the smallest Tribe I yet had seen  Plain was their Dress and modest was their Mein  Great Idol of Mankind we neither claim  The Praise of Merit nor aspire to Fame  But safe in Deserts from the Applause of Men  Would die unheard of as we liv'd unseen  'Tis all we beg thee to conceal from Sight  Those Acts of Goodness which themselves requite  O let us still the secret Joy partake  To follow Virtue ev'n for Virtue's sake  And live there Men who slight immortal Fame  Who then with Incense shall adore our Name  But Mortals know 'tis still our greatest Pride  To blaze those Virtues which the Good would hide  Rise Muses rise add all your tuneful Breath  These must not sleep in Darkness and in Death  She said in Air the trembling Musick floats  And up the Winds triumphant swell the Notes  So soft tho' high so loud and yet so clear  Ev'n list'ning Angels lean'd from Heaven to hear  To farthest Shores th' Ambrosial Spirit flies  Sweet to the World and grateful to the Skies  Next these a youthful Train their Vows exprest  With Feathers crown'd with gay Embroid'ry drest  Hither they cry'd direct your Eyes and see  The Men of Pleasure Dress and Gallantry  Ours is the Place at Banquets Balls and Plays  Sprightly our Nights polite are all our Days  Courts we frequent where 'tis our pleasing Care  To pay due Visits and address the Fair  In fact 'tis true no Nymph we cou'd persuade  But still in Fancy vanquish'd ev'ry Maid  Of unknown Dutchesses leud Tales we tell  Yet would the World believe us all were well  The Joy let others have and we the Name  And what we want in Pleasure grant in Fame  The Queen assents the Trumpet rends the Skies  And at each Blast a Lady's Honour dies  Pleas'd with the strange Success vast Numbers prest  Around the Shrine and made the same Request  What you she cry'd unlearn'd in Arts to please  Slaves to your selves and ev'n fatigu'd with Ease  Who lose a Length of undeserving Days  Wou'd you usurp the Lover's dearbought Praise  To just Contempt ye vain Pretenders fall  The Peoples Fable and the Scorn of all  Strait the black Clarion sends a horrid Sound  Loud Laughs burst out and bitter Scoffs fly round  Whispers were heard with Taunts reviling loud  And scornful Hisses ran thro' all the Croud  Last those who boast of mighty Mischiefs done  Enslave their Country or usurp a Throne  Or who their Glory's dire Foundation laid  On Sovereigns ruin'd or on Friends betray'd  Calm thinking Villains whom no Faith can fix  Of crooked Counsels and dark Politicks  Of these a gloomy Tribe surround the Throne  And beg to make th' immortal Treasons known  The Trumpet roars long flaky Flames expire  With Sparks that seem'd to set the World on fire  At the dread Sound pale Mortals stood aghast  And startled Nature trembled with the Blast  This having heard and seen some Pow'r unknown  Strait chang'd the Scene and snatch'd me from the Throne  Before my View appear'd a Structure fair  Its Site uncertain if in Earth or Air  With rapid Motion turn'd the Mansion round  With ceaseless Noise the ringing Walls resound  Not less in Number were the spacious Doors  Than Leaves on Trees or Sands upon the Shores  Which still unfolded stand by Night by Day  Pervious to Winds and open ev'ry way  As Flames by Nature to the Skies ascend  As weighty Bodies to the Center tend  As to the Sea returning Rivers roll  And the touch'd Needle trembles to the Pole  Hither as to their proper Place arise  All various Sounds from Earth and Seas and Skies  Or spoke aloud or whisper'd in the Ear  Nor ever Silence Rest or Peace is here  As on the smooth Expanse of Crystal Lakes  The sinking Stone at first a Circle makes  The trembling Surface by the Motion stir'd  Spreads in a second Circle then a third  Wide and more wide the floating Rings advance  Fill all the wat'ry Plain and to the Margin dance  Thus ev'ry Voice and Sound when first they break  On neighb'ring Air a soft Impression make  Another ambient Circle then they move  That in its turn impels the next above  Thro' undulating Air the Sounds are sent  And spread o'er all the fluid Element  There various News I heard of Love and Strife  Of Peace and War Health Sickness Death and Life  Of Loss and Gain of Famine and of Store  Of Storms at Sea and Travels on the Shore  Of Prodigies and Portents seen in Air  Of Fires and Plagues and Stars with blazing Hair  Of Turns of Fortune Changes in the State  The Falls of Fav'rites Projects of the Great  Of old Mismanagements Taxations new  All neither wholly false nor wholly true  Above below without within around  Confus'd unnumber'd Multitudes are found  Who pass repass advance and glide away  Hosts rais'd by Fear and Phantoms of a Day  Astrologers that future Fates foreshew  Projectors Quacks and Lawyers not a few  And Priests and PartyZealots num'rous Bands  With homeborn Lyes or Tales from foreign Lands  Each talk'd aloud or in some secret Place  And wild Impatience star'd in ev'ry Face  The flying Rumours gather'd as they roll'd  Scarce any Tale was sooner heard than told  And all who told it added something new  And all who heard it made Enlargements too  In ev'ry Ear it spread on ev'ry Tongue it grew  Thus flying East and West and North and South  News travel'd with Increase from Mouth to Mouth  So from a Spark that kindled first by Chance  With gath'ring Force the quick'ning Flames advance  Till to the Clouds their curling Heads aspire  And Tow'rs and Temples sink in Floods of Fire  When thus ripe Lyes are to perfection sprung  Full grown and fit to grace a mortal Tongue  Thro' thousand Vents impatient forth they flow  And rush in Millions on the World below  Fame sits aloft and points them out their Course  Their Date determines and prescribes their Force  Some to remain and some to perish soon  Or wane and wax alternate like the Moon  Around a thousand winged Wonders fly  Born by the Trumpet's Blast and scatter'd thro' the Sky  There at one Passage oft you might survey  A Lye and Truth contending for the way  And long 'twas doubtful both so closely pent  Which first should issue thro' the narrow Vent  At last agreed together out they fly  Inseparable now the Truth and Lye  The strict Companions are for ever join'd  And this or that unmix'd no Mortal e'er shall find  While thus I stood intent to see and hear  One came methought and whisper'd in my Ear  What cou'd thus high thy rash Ambition raise  Art thou fond Youth a Candidate for Praise  'Tis true said I not void of Hopes I came  For who so fond as youthful Bards of Fame  But few alas the casual Blessing boast  So hard to gain so easy to be lost  How vain that second Life in others Breath  Th' Estate which Wits inherit after Death  Ease Health and Life for this we must resign  Unsure the Tenure but how vast the Fine  The Great Man's Curse without the Gains endure  Be envy'd wretched and be flatter'd poor  All luckless Wits our Enemies profest  And all successful jealous Friends at best  Nor Fame I slight nor for her Favours call  She comes unlook'd for if she comes at all  But if the Purchase costs so dear a Price  As soothing Folly or exalting Vice  Oh if the Muse must flatter lawless Sway  And follow still where Fortune leads the way  Or if no Basis bear my rising Name  But the fall'n Ruins of Another's Fame  Then teach me Heaven to scorn the guilty Bays  Drive from my Breast that wretched Lust of Praise  Unblemish'd let me live or die unknown  Oh grant an honest Fame or grant me none  NOTES  _SOME modern Criticks from a pretended Refinement of Taste have declar'd themselves unable to relish allegorical Poems 'Tis not easy to penetrate into the meaning of this Criticism for if  Fable  be allow'd one of the chief Beauties or as  Aristotle  calls it the very  Soul  of Poetry 'tis hard to comprehend how that Fable should be the less valuable for having a Moral The Ancients constantly made use of Allegories My Lord  Bacon  has compos'd an express Treatise in proof of this entitled  The Wisdom of the Antients  where the Reader may see several particular Fictions exemplify'd and explain'd with great Clearness Judgment and Learning The Incidents indeed by which the Allegory is convey'd must be vary'd according to the different Genius or Manners of different Times and they should never be spun too long or too much clogg'd with trivial Circumstances or little Particularities We find an uncommon Charm in Truth when it is convey'd by this Sideway to our Ʋnderstanding and 'tis observable that even in the most ignorant Ages this way of Writing has found Reception Almost all the Poems in the old  Provençal  had this Turn and from these it was that  Petrarch  took the Idea of his Poetry We have his  Trionfi  in this kind and  Boccace  pursu'd in the same Track Soon after  Chaucer  introduc'd it here whose  Romaunt of the Rose Court of Love Flower and the Leaf House of Fame  and some others of his Writings are Masterpieces of this sort In Epick Poetry 'tis true too nice and exact a Pursuit of the Allegory is justly esteem'd a Fault and  Chaucer  had the Discernment to avoid it in his  Knight  's  Tale  which was an Attempt towards an Epick Poem  Ariosto  with less judgment gave intirely into it in his  Orlando  which tho' carry'd to an Excess had yet so much Reputation in  Italy  that  Tasso  who reduc'd Heroick Poetry to the juster Standard of the Ancients was forc'd to prefix to his Work a scrupulous Explanation of the Allegory of it to which the Fable itself could scarce have directed his Readers Our Countryman  Spencer  follow'd whose Poem is almost intirely allegorical and imitates the manner of  Ariosto  rather than that of  Tasso  Ʋpon the whole one may observe this sort of Writing however discontinu'd of late was in all Times so far from being rejected by the best Poets that some of them have rather err'd by insisting in it too closely and carrying it too far And that to infer from thence that the Allegory it self is vicious is a presumptuous Contradiction to the Judgment and Practice of the greatest Genius's both ancient and modern  Pag  II  ver    So  Zembla  's Rocks  c  Tho' a short Verisimilitude be not requir'd in the Descriptions of this visionary and allegorical kind of Poetry which admits of every wild Object that Fancy may present in a Dream and where it is sufficient if the moral Meaning atone for the Improbability Yet Men are naturally so desirous of Truth that a Reader is generally pleas'd in such a Case with some Excuse or Allusion that seems to reconcile the Description to Probability and Nature The Simile here is of that sort and renders it not wholly unlikely that a  Rock  of  Ice  should remain for ever by mentioning something like it in the Northern Regions agreeing with the Accounts of our modern Travellers  P    ver    Four Faces had the Dome  c  The Temple is describ'd to be square the four Fronts with open Gates facing the different Quarters of the World as an Intimation that all Nations of the Earth may alike be receiv'd into it The Western Front is of  Grecian  Architecture the Dorick Order was peculiarly sacred to Heroes and Warriors Those whose Statues are here mention'd were the first Names of old  Greece  in Arms and Arts  Pag    ver    There great  Alcides  c  This Figure of  Hercules  is drawn with an eye to the Position of the famous Statue of  Farnese  Pag    ver    And the great Founder of the  Persian  Name  Cyrus  was the Beginner of the  Persian  as  Nihus  was of the  Assyrian  Monarchy The  Magi  and  Chaldeans  the chief of whom was  Zoroaster  employ'd their Studies upon Magick and Astrology which was in a manner almost all the Learning of the antient  Asian  People We have scarce any Account of a moral Philosopher except  Confucius  the great Lawgiver of the  Chinese  who liv'd about two thousand Years ago  Pag    ver    Egypt  's Priests  c  The Learning of the old  Egyptian  Priests consisted for the most part in Geometry and Astronomy They also preserv'd the History of their Nation Their greatest Hero upon Record is  Sesostris  whose Actions and Conquests may be seen at large in  Diodorus  c He is said to have caus'd the Kings he vanquish'd to draw him in his Chariot The Posture of his Statue in these Verses is correspondent to the Description which  Herodotus  gives of one of this Prince's Statues remaining in his own time  Pag    ver    Of  Gothick  Structure was the Northern Side  The Architecture is agreeable to that part of the World The Learning of the  Northern  Nations lay more obscure than that of the rest  Zamolxis  was the Disciple of  Pythagoras  who taught the Immortality of the Soul to the  Scythians Odin  or  Woden  was the great Legislator and Hero of the  Goths  They tell us of him that being subject to Fits he persuaded his Followers that during those Trances he receiv'd Inspirations from whence he dictated his Laws He is said to have been the Inventor of the  Runic  Characters  Pag    ver    Druids  and  Bards  c  These were the Priests and Poets of those People so celebrated for their savage Virtue Those heroick Barbarians accounted it a Dishonour to die in their Beds and rush'd on to certain Death in the Prospect of an AfterLife and for the Glory of a Song from their Bards in Praise of their Actions  Pag    ver  ult  The Youth that all things but himself subdu'd  Alexander  the Great The  Tiara  was the Crown peculiar to the  Asian  Princes His Desire to be thought the Son of  Jupiter Ammon  caus'd him to wear the Horns of that God and to represent the same upon his Coins which was continu'd by several of his Successors  Pag    ver    Timoleon  glorious in his Brother's Blood  Timoleon  had sav'd the Life of his Brother  Timophanes  in the Battel between the  Argives  and  Corinthians  but afterwards kill'd him when he affected the Tyranny preferring his Duty to his Country to all the Obligations of Blood  Pag    ver    He whom  Athens  did expel  In all things just but when he sign'd the Shell  Aristides  who for his great Integrity was distinguish'd by the Appellation of  the Just  When his Countrymen would have banish'd him by the  Ostracism  where it was the Custom for every Man to sign the Name of the Person he voted to Exile in an OysterShell a Peasant who could not write came to  Aristides  to do it for him who readily sign'd his own Name  Vide Plutarch  See the same Author of  Phocion Agis  c  Pag    ver    But in the Center of the hallow'd Quire  c  In the midst of the Temple nearest the Throne of  Fame  are plac'd the greatest Names in Learning of all Antiquity These are describ'd in such Attitudes as express their different Characters The Columns on which they are rais'd are adorn'd with Sculptures taken from the most striking Subjects of their Works which are so executed as that the Sculpture bears a Resemblance in its Manner and Character to the Manner and Character of their Writings  Pag    ver    Four Swans sustain  c  Pindar  being seated in a Chariot alludes to the Chariotraces he celebrated in the  Grecian  Games The Swans are the Emblems of the  Ode  as their soaring Posture intimates the Sublimity and Activity of his Genius  Neptune  presided over the  Isthmian  and  Jupiter  over the  Olympian  Games  Pag    ver    Pleas'd with  Alcaeus  Manly Rage t' infuse  The softer Spirit of the  Sapphick  Muse  This expresses the mixt Character of the Odes of  Horace  The second of
