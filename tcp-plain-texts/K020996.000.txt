of Praise and Censure stand  Ver See NOTE I    Their mingled streams her motley servants shed  On each bold Author's selfdevoted head  On thee O GIBBON in whose splendid page  ROME shines majestic 'mid the woes of age  Mistaken Zeal wrapt in a priestly pall  Has from the baser urn pour'd darkest gall  These stains to Learning would a Bard efface  With tides of glory from the golden vase  But that he feels this nobler task require  A spirit glowing with congenial fire  A VIRGIL only may uncensur'd aim  To sing in equal verse a LIVY's fame  Yet while Polemics in fierce league combin'd  With savage discord vex thy feeling mind  And with a pure Religion's just defence  Blend gross detraction and perverted sense  Thy wounded ear may haply not refuse  The soothing accents of an humbler Muse  The lovely Science whose attractive air  Derives new charms from thy devoted care  Is near ally'd to that bewitching Art  Which reigns the idol of the Poet's heart  Tho' sister Goddesses thy guardian maid  Shines in the robe of fresher youth array'd  Like PALLAS recent from the brain of JOVE  When Strength with Beauty in her features strove  While elder Poesy in every clime  The flower of earliest fall has past her prime  The bloom which her autumnal cheeks supply  Palls on the Public's philosophic eye  But tho' no more with Fancy's strong controul  Her Epic wonders fascinate the soul  With humbler hopes she wishes still to please  By moral elegance and labour'd ease  Like other Prudes leaves Beauty's lost pretence  And strives to charm by Sentiment and Sense  Yet deaf to Envy's voice and Pride's alarms  She loves the rival who eclips'd her charms  Safe in thy favour she would fondly stray  Round the wide realm which owns that Sister's sway  Sing the just fav'rites of historic fame  And mark their purest laws and noblest aim  My eyes with joy this pathless field explore  Cross'd by no ROMAN Bard no GREEKS of yore  Those mighty Lords of literary sway  Have pass'd this province with a slight survey  E'en He whose bold and comprehensive mind  Immortal rules to Poesy assign'd  High Priest of Learning has not fix'd apart  The laws and limits of historic Art  Yet one excelling  Ver See NOTE II  GREEK in later days  The happy teacher of harmonious phrase  Whose patient fingers all the threads untwine  Which in the mystic chain of Music join  Strict DIONYSIUS of severest Taste  Has justly some historic duties trac'd  And some pure precepts into practice brought  Th' Historian proving what the Critic taught  And  Ver See NOTE III  LUCIAN thou of Humour's sons supreme  Hast touch'd with liveliest art this tempting theme  When in the ROMAN world corrupt and vain  Historic Fury madden'd every brain  When each base GREEK indulg'd his frantic dream  And rose a  Ver See NOTE IV  XENOPHON in selfesteem  Thy Genius satyriz'd the scribbling slave  And to the liberal pen just lessons gave  O skill'd to season in proportion fit  Severer wisdom with thy sportive wit  Breathe thy strong power thy sprightly grace infuse  In the bold efforts of no servile Muse  If she transplant some lively flower that throws  Immortal sweetness o'er thy Attic Prose  In Egypt  Ver See NOTE V  once a dread tribunal stood  Offspring of Wisdom source of Public Good  Before this Seat by holy Justice rear'd  The mighty Dead in solemn pomp appear'd  For 'till its sentence had their rights expos'd  The hallow'd portals of the tomb were clos'd  A sculptur'd form of Truth the Judges wore  A sacred emblem of the charge they bore  The claims of Virtue their pure voice exprest  And bade the opening grave receive its honor'd guest  In such a court array'd in Judgment's robe  With powers extensive as the peopled Globe  To her just bar impartial Hist'ry brings  The gorgeous group of Statesmen Heroes Kings  With all whose minds outshining splendid birth  Attract the notice of th' enlighten'd earth  From artful Pomp she strips the proud disguise  That flash'd delusion in admiring eyes  To injur'd Worth gives Glory's wish reward  And blazons Virtue in her bright record  Nature's clear Mirror Life's instructive Guide  Her Wisdom sour'd by no preceptive Pride  Age from her lesson forms its wisest aim  And youthful Emulation springs to Fame  Yet thus adorn'd with noblest powers design'd  To charm correct and elevate mankind  From darkest Time her humble Birth she drew  And slowly into Strength and Beauty grew  As mighty streams that roll with gather'd force  Spring feebly forth from some sequester'd source  The fond desire to pass the nameless crowd  Swept from the earth in dark Oblivion's cloud  Of transient life to leave some little trace  And win remembrance from the rising race  Led early Chiefs to make their prowess known  By the rude symbol on the artless stone  And long ere man the wondrous secret found  To paint the voice and fix the fleeting sound  The infant Muse ambitious at her birth  Ver See NOTE VI  Rose the young herald of heroic worth  The tuneful record of her oral praise  The Sire's atchievements to the Son conveys  Keen Emulation wrapt in trance sublime  Drinks with retentive ear the potent rhyme  And faithful Memory from affection strong  Spreads the rich torrent of her martial song  Letters at length arise but envious Night  Conceals their blest Inventor from our sight  O'er the wide earth his spreading bounty flew  And swift those precious seeds of Science grew  Thence quickly sprung the Annal's artless frame  Time its chief boast and brevity its aim  The Templewall preserv'd a simple date  And mark'd in plainest form the Monarch's fate  But in the center of those vast abodes  Ver See NOTE VII  Whose mighty mass the land of Egypt loads  Where in rude triumph over years unknown  Gigantic Grandeur from his spiry throne  Seems to look down disdainful and deride  The poor the pigmy toils of modern Pride  In the close covert of those gloomy cells  Where early Magic fram'd her venal spells  Combining priests from many an ancient tale  Wove for their hallow'd use Religion's veil  A wondrous texture supple rich and broad  To dazzle Folly and to shelter Fraud  This as her caestus Superstition wore  And saw th' enchanted world its powers adore  For in the mystic web was every charm  To lure the timid and the bold disarm  To win from easy Faith a blind esteem  And lull Devotion in a lasting dream  The Sorceress to spread her empire drest  History's young form in this illusive vest  Whose infant voice repeated as she taught  The motley fables on her mantle wrought  Till Attic Freedom brought the Foundling home  From the dark cells of her Egyptian dome  Drew by degrees th' oppressive veil aside  And shewing the fair Nymph in nature's pride  Taught her to speak with all the fire of youth  The words of Wisdom in the tone of Truth  To catch the passing shew of public life  And paint immortal scenes of Grecian strife  Inchanting Athens oft as Learning calls  Our fond attention to thy fost'ring walls  Still with fresh joy thy glories we explore  With new idolatry thy charms adore  Bred in thy bosom the Historian caught  The warmest glow of elevated thought  Yet while thy triumphs to his eye display  The noblest scene his pencil can portray  While thy rich language grac'd by every Muse  Supplies the brightest tints his hand can use  How few O Athens can thy genius raise  To the bright summit of historic praise  But such hard fortunes human hopes attend  Tho' to each Science many myriads bend  Each gives and with a coy reluctant hand  Her badge of honor to a chosen band  Pure faultless writing like transmuted gold  Mortals may wish but never shall behold  Let Genius still this glorious object own  And seek Perfection's philosophic stone  For while the mind in study's toilsome hours  Tries on the long research her latent powers  New wonders rise to pay her patient thought  Inferior only to the prize she sought  But idle Pride no arduous labor sees  And deems th' Historian's toil a task of ease  Yet if survey'd by Judgment's steady lamp  How few are justly grac'd with Glory's stamp  Tho' more these volumes than the ruthless mind  Of the fierce OMAR to the flames consign'd  Ver See NOTE VIII  When Learning saw the savage with a smile  Devote her offspring to the blazing pile  O History whose pregnant mines impart  Unfailing treasures to poetic art  The Epic gem and those of darker hues  Whose trembling lustre decks the tragic Muse  If justly conscious of thy powers I raise  A votive tablet to record thy praise  That ancient temple to my view unfold  Where thy first Sons on Glory's list enroll'd  To Fancy's eye in living forms appear  And fill with Freedom's notes the raptur'd ear  The dome expandsBehold th' Historic Sire  Ver See NOTE IX  Ionic roses mark his soft attire  Bold in his air but graceful in his mien  As the fair figure of his favour'd Queen  Ver See NOTE X  When her proud galley sham'd the Persian van  And grateful XERXES own'd her more than man  Soft as the stream whose dimpling waters play  Ver See NOTE XI  And wind in lucid lapse their pleasurable way  His rich Homeric elocution flows  For all the Muses modulate his prose  Tho' blind Credulity his step misleads  Thro' the dark mist of her Egyptian meads  Yet when return'd with patriot passions warm  He paints the progress of the Persian storm  In Truth's illumin'd field his labours rear  A trophy worthy of the Spartan spear  His eager country in th' Olympic vale  Throngs with proud joy to catch the martial tale  Behold where Valour resting on his lance  Drinks the sweet sound in rapture's silent trance  Then with a grateful shout of fond acclaim  Hails the just herald of his country's fame  But mark the Youth in dumb delight immers'd  Ver See Note XII  See the proud tear of emulation burst  O faithful sign of a superior soul  Thy prayer is heard'tis thine to reach the goal  See blest OLORUS fee the palm is won  Sublimity and Wisdom crown thy Son  His the rich prize that caught his early gaze  Th' eternal treasure of increasing praise  Pure from the stain of favor or of hate  His nervous line unfolds the deep Debate  Explores the seeds of War with matchless force  Draws Discord springing from Ambition's source  With all her Demagogues who murder Peace  In the fierce struggles of contentious Greece  Stript by Ingratitude of just command  Above resentment to a thankless land  Above all envy rancour pride and spleen  In exile patient in disgrace serene  And proud to celebrate as Truth inspires  Each patriot Hero that his soul admires  The deepton'd trumpet of renown he blows  In sage retirement 'mid the Thracian snows  But to untimely silence Fate devotes  Those lips yet trembling with imperfect notes  And base Oblivion threatens to devour  Ev'n this first offspring of historic power  A generous guardian of a rival's fame  Ver See NOTE XIII  Mars the dark Fiend in this malignant aim  Accomplish'd XENOPHON thy truth has shewn  A brother's glory sacred as thy own  O rich in all the blended gifts that grace  Minerva's darling sons of Attic race  The Sage's olive the Historian's palm  The Victor's laurel all thy name embalm  Thy simple diction free from glaring art  With sweet allurement steals upon the heart  Pure as the rill that Nature's hand refines  Clear as thy harmony of soul it shines  Two passions there by soft contention please  The love of martial Fame and learned Ease  These friendly colours exquisitely join'd  Form the inchanting picture of thy mind  Thine was the praise bright models to afford  To CAESAR's rival pen and rival sword  Blest had Ambition not destroy'd his claim  To the mild lustre of thy purer fame  Thou pride of Greece in thee her triumphs end  And Roman chiefs in borrow'd pomp ascend  Rome's haughty genius who enslav'd the Greek  Ver See NOTE XIV  In Grecian language deigns at first to speak  By slow degrees her ruder tongue she taught  To tell the wonders that her valour wrought  And her historic host with envious eye  View in their glittering van a Greek ally  Thou Friend of SCIPIO vers'd in War's alarms  Ver See NOTE XV  Torn from thy wounded country's struggling arms  And doom'd in Latian bosoms to instill  Thy moral virtue and thy martial skill  Pleas'd in researches of elaborate length  To trace the fibres of the Roman strength  O highly perfect in each nobler part  The Sage's wisdom and the Soldier's art  This richer half of Grecian praise is thine  But o'er thy style the slighted Graces pine  And tir'd Attention toils thro' many a maze  To reach the purport of thy doubtful phrase  Yet large are his rewards whose toils engage  To clear the spirit of thy cloudy page  Like Indian fruit its rugged rind contains  Those milky sweets that pay the searcher's pains  But Rome's proud Genius with exulting claim  Points to her rivals of the Grecian name  Sententious SALLUST leads her lofty train  Ver See NOTE XVI  Clear tho' concife elaborately plain  Poising his scale of words with frugal care  Nor leaving one superfluous atom there  Yet well displaying in a narrow space  Truth's native strength and Nature's easy grace  Skill'd to detect in tracing Action's course  The hidden motive and the human source  His lucid brevity the palm has won  By Rome's decision from OLORUS' Son  Of mightier spirit of majestic frame  With powers proportion'd to the Roman fame  When Rome's fierce Eagle his broad wings unfurl'd  And shadow'd with his plumes the subject world  In bright preeminence that Greece might own  Sublimer LIVY claims th' Historic throne  Ver See NOTE XVII  With that rich Eloquence whose golden light  Brings the full scene distinctly to the sight  That Zeal for Truth which Interest cannot bend  That Fire which Freedom ever gives her friend  Immortal artist of a work supreme  Delighted Rome beheld with proud esteem  Her own bright image of Colossal size  From thy long toils in purest marble rise  But envious Time with a malignant stroke  This sacred statue into fragments broke  In Lethe's stream its nobler portions sunk  And left Futurity the wounded trunk  Yet like the matchless mutilated frame  Ver See NOTE XVIII  To which great ANGELO bequeath'd his name  This glorious ruin in whose strength we find  The splendid vigour of the Sculptor's mind  In the fond eye of Admiration still  Rivals the finish'd forms of modern skill  Next but O LIVY as unlike to thee  As the pent river to th' expanding sea  Sarcastic TACITUS abrupt and dark  Ver See NOTE XIX  In moral anger forms the keen remark  Searching the soul with microscopic power  To mark the latent worm that mars the flower  His Roman voice in base degenerate days  Spoke to Imperial Pride in Freedom's praise  And with indignant hate severely warm  Shew'd to gigantic Guilt his ghastly form  There are whose censures to his Style assign  A subtle spirit rigid and malign  Which magnified each monster that he drew  And gave the darkest vice a deeper hue  Yet his strong pencil shews the gentlest heart  In one sweet sketch of Biographic art  Whose softest tints by filial love combin'd  Form the pure image of his Father's mind  O blest Biography thy charms of yore  Historic Truth to strong Affection bore  And fost'ring Virtue gave thee as thy dower  Of both thy Parents the attractive power  To win the heart the wavering thought to fix  And fond delight with wise instruction mix  First of thy votaries peerless and alone  Thy PLUTARCH shines by moral beauty known  Ver See NOTE XX  Enchanting Sage whose living lessons teach  What heights of Virtue human efforts reach  Tho' oft thy Pen eccentrically wild  Ramble in Learning's various maze beguil'd  Tho' in thy Style no brilliant graces shine  Nor the clear conduct of correct Design  Thy every page is uniformly bright  With mild Philanthropy's diviner light  Of gentlest manners as of mind elate  Thy happy Genius had the glorious fate  To regulate with Wisdom's soft controul  The strong ambition of a TRAJAN's soul  But O how rare benignant Virtue springs  In the blank bosom of despotic kings  Thou bane of liberal Knowledge Nature's curse  Parent of Misery pamper'd Vice's nurse  Plunging by thy annihilating breath  The soul of Genius in the trance of death  Unbounded Power beneath thy baleful sway  The voice of Hist'ry sinks in dumb decay  Still in thy gloomy reign one martial Greek  In Rome's corrupted language dares to speak  Mild MARCELLINUS free from servile awe  Ver See NOTE XXI  A faithful painter of the woes he saw  Forc'd by the meanness of his age to join  Adulterate Colours with his just Design  The slighted Attic Muse no more supplies  Her pencil dipt in Nature's purest dies  And Roman Emulation at a stand  Drops the blurr'd pallet from her palsy'd hand  But while Monastic Night with gathering shades  The ruin'd realm of History invades  While pent in CONSTANTINE's illfated walls  The mangled form of Roman Grandeur falls  And like a Gladiator on the sand  Props his faint body with a dying hand  While savage Turks or the fierce Sons of Thor  Wage on the Arts a wild Titanian war  While manly Knowledge hides his radiant head  As Jove in terror from the Titans fled  See in the lovely charms of female youth  A second Pallas guards the throne of Truth  And with COMNENA's royal name imprest  Ver See NOTE XXII  The zone of Beauty binds her Attic vest  Fair star of Wisdom whose unrival'd light  Breaks thro' the stormy cloud of thickest night  Tho' in the purple of proud misery nurst  From those oppressive bands thy spirit burst  Pleas'd in thy public labours to forget  The keen domestic pangs of fond regret  Pleas'd to preserve from Time's destructive rage  A Father's virtues in thy faithful page  Too pure of soul to violate or hide  Th' Historian's duty in the Daughter's pride  Tho' base Oblivion long with envious hand  Hid the fair volume which thy virtue plann'd  It shines redeem'd from Ruin's darkest hour  A wond'rous monument of Female power  While conscious Hist'ry careful of thy fame  Ranks in her Attic band thy filial name  And sees on Glory's stage thy graceful mien  Close the long triumph of her ancient scene  END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE

Hoping some curious Shell or Coralroot  May pay the labours of their long pursuit  And yield their hand the pleasure to display  Nature's neglected Gems in nice array  So GIBBON toils the mind whose labour wades  Thro' the dull Chronicle's monastic shades  To pick from that drear coast with learned care  New shells of Knowledge thinly scatter'd there  Who patient hears while cloister'd Dullness tells  The lying legend of her murky cells  Or strangely mingles in her phrase uncouth  Disgusting Lies with unimportant Truth  How Bishops give each tort'ring Fiend o'ercome  Life to the faint and language to the dumb  How sainted Kings renounce with holy dread  Ver See NOTE I  The chaste endearments of their marriagebed  How Nuns entranc'd to joys celestial mount  Ver See NOTE II  Made drunk with rapture from a sacred fount  How cunning Priests their dying Lord cajole  And take his riches to ensure his soul  While he endows them in his pious will  With those dear gifts the Meadow and the Mill  Ver See NOTE III  They wisely chronicle his Spirit's health  And give him Virtue in return for Wealth  So Hist'ry sinks by Hypocrites deprest  In the coarse habit of the cloister drest  While her weak Sons that noxious air imbibe  Such are the tales of their monastic tribe  But let not Pride with blind contempt arraign  Each early Writer in that humble train  No let the Muse a friend to every claim  That marks the Candidate for honest fame  Be just to patient Worth severely sunk  And paint the merits of the modest Monk  Ye purer minds who stopt with native force  Barbaric Ignorance's brutal course  Who in the field of Hist'ry dark and waste  Your simple path with steady patience trac'd  Blest be your labours and your virtues blest  Tho' paid with insult and with scorn opprest  Ye rescu'd Learning's lamp from total night  And sav'd with anxious toil the trembling light  In the wild storm of that tempestuous time  When Superstition cherish'd every crime  When meaner Priests pronounc'd with falt'ring tongue  Nor knew to read the jargon which they sung  When Nobles train'd like bloodhounds to destroy  In ruthless rapine plac'd their savage joy  And Monarchs wanted ev'n the skill to frame  The letters that compos'd their mighty name  How strong the mind that try'd by ills like these  Could write untainted with the Time's disease  That free from Folly's lie and Fraud's pretence  Could rise to simple Truth and sober Sense  Such minds existed in the darkest hour  Of blind Barbarity's debasing power  If mitred TURPIN told in wildest strain  Ver See NOTE IV  Of giantfeats atchiev'd by CHARLEMAIN  Of spears that blossom'd like the flowery thorn  Of ROLAND's magic sword and ivory horn  Whose sound was wasted by an angel's wing  In notes of anguish to his distant king  Yet modest AEGINHARD with grateful care  Ver See NOTE V  In purer colours and with Nature's air  Has drawn distinctly in his clear record  A juster portrait of this mighty Lord  Whose forceful lance against the Pagan hurl'd  Shone the bright terror of a barbarous world  Nor on his master does he idly shower  The priestly gifts of supernat'ral Power  This candid Scribe of Gratitude and Truth  Correctly paints the Patron of his youth  Th' imperial Savage whose unletter'd mind  Was active strong beneficent and kind  Who tho' he lov'd the Learned to requite  Knew not that simplest art the art to write  If British GEFFREY fill'd his motley page  Ver See NOTE VI  With MERLIN's spells and UTHER's amorous rage  With fables from the field of Magic glean'd  Giant and Dragon Incubus and Fiend  Yet Life's great drama and the Deeds of men  Sage Monk of Malm'sbury engaged thy pen  Ver See NOTE VII  Nor vainly dost thou plead in modest phrase  Thy manly passion for ingenuous praise  'Twas thine the labours of thy Sires to clear  From Fiction's harden'd spots with toil severe  To form with eyes intent on public life  Thy bolder sketches of internal strife  And warmly celebrate with love refin'd  The rich endowments of thy GLO'STER's mind  May this thy Praise the Monkish pen exempt  From the ungenerous blame of blind Contempt  Tho' Truth appear to make thy works her care  The lurking Prodigy still lingers there  But let not censure on thy name be thrown  For errors springing from thy age alone  Shame on the Critic who with idle scorn  Depreciates Authors in dark periods born  Because they want irregularly bright  That equal Knowledge and that steadier Light  Which Learning in its wide meridian blaze  Has haply lavish'd on his luckier days  In all its various paths the human Mind  Feels the first efforts of its strength confin'd  And in the field where History's laurels grow  Winds its long march superlatively slow  Like Fruit whose taste to sweet luxuriance runs  By constant succour from autumnal suns  This lovely Science ripens by degrees  And late is fashion'd into graceful ease  In those enlivening days when Europe rose  From the long pressure of lethargic woes  When the Provençal lyre with roses drest  By ardent Love's extatic fingers prest  Wak'd into life the Genius of the West  When Chivalry her banners all unfurl'd  Fill'd with heroic fire the splendid world  In highplum'd grandeur held her gorgeous reign  And rank'd each brilliant Virtue in her train  When she imparted by her magic glove  To Honour strength and purity to Love  Newmoulded Nature on her noblest plan  And gave fresh sinews to the soul of man  When the chief model of her forming hand  Our sable EDWARD on the Gallic strand  Display'd that spirit which her laws bestow  And shone the idol of his captive foe  Unblest with Arts th' unletter'd age could yield  No skilful hand to paint from Glory's field  Scenes that Humanity with pride must hear  And Admiration honour with a tear  Yet Courtesy with generous Valour join'd  Fair Twins of Chivalry rejoic'd to find  A faithful Chronicler in plain FROISSART  Ver See NOTE VIII  As rich in honesty as void of art  As the young Peasant led by spirits keen  To some great city's gay and gorgeous scene  Returning with increase of proud delight  Dwells on the various splendor of the sight  And gives his tale tho' told in terms uncouth  The charm of Nature and the force of Truth  Tho' rude engaging such thy simple page  Seems O FROISSART to this enlighten'd age  Proud of their spirit in thy writings shewn  Fair Faith and Honour mark thee for their own  Tho' oft the dupe of those delusive times  Thy Genius foster'd with romantic rhymes  Appears to play the legendary Bard  And trespass on the Truth it meant to guard  Still shall thy Name with lasting glory stand  High on the list of that advent'rous band  Who bidding History speak a modern Tongue  From her cramp'd hand the Monkish fetters flung  While yet depress'd in Gothic night she lay  Nor saw th' approaching dawn of Attic day  On the blest banks of Tiber's honoured stream  Shone the first glance of that reviving beam  Enlighten'd Pontiffs on the very spot  Where Science was proscrib'd and Sense forgot  Bade Learning start from out her mould'ring tomb  And taught new laurels on her brow to bloom  Their Magic voice invok'd all Arts and all  Sprung into glory at the potent call  As in Arabia's waste where Horror reigns  Gigantic tyrant of the burning plains  The glorious bounty of some Royal mind  By Heaven inspir'd and friend to human kind  Bids the rich Structure of refreshment rise  To chear the Traveller's despairing eyes  Who sees with rapture the new fountains burst  And as he slakes his soulsubduing thirst  Blesses the hand which all his pains beguil'd  And rais'd an Eden in the dreary wild  Such praises LEO to thy name are due  From all who Learning's cultur'd field review  And to its Fountain in thy liberal heart  Trace the diffusive Stream of modern Art  'Twas not thy praise to animate alone  The speaking Canvass and the breathing Stone  Or tides of Bounty round Parnassus roll  To quicken Genius in the Poet's soul  Thy Favour like the Sun's prolific ray  Brought the keen SCRIBE OF FLORENCE into Day  Ver See NOTE IX  Whose subtle Wit discharg'd a dubious shaft  Call'd both the Friend and Foe of Kingly Craft  Tho' in his maze of Politics perplext  Great Names have differ'd on that doubtful text  Here crown'd with praise as true to Virtue's side  There view'd with horror as th' Assassin's guide  High in a purer sphere he shines afar  And Hist'ry hails him as her Morningstar  Nor less O LEO was it thine to raise  The great Historic Chief of modern days  Ver See NOTE X  The solemn GUICCIARDIN whose pen severe  Unsway'd by favour nor restrain'd by fear  Mark'd in his close of life with keen disdain  Each fatal blemish in thy motley reign  Who like OLORUS' Son of spirit chaste  And form'd to martial toils minutely trac'd  The woes he saw his bleeding country bear  And wars in which he claim'd no trivial share  With equal wreaths let DAVILA be crown'd  Ver See NOTE XI  Alike in letters and in arms renown'd  Who from his country driv'n by dire mischance  Plung'd in the civil broils of bleeding France  Maintaining still in Party's raging sea  His judgment steady and his spirit free  Save when the fierce religion of his Sires  Drown'd the soft zeal Humanity inspires  Who boldly wrote with such a faithful hand  The tragic story of that foreign land  The hoary Gallic Chief whose tranquil age  Listen'd with joy to his recording page  Tracing the scenes familiar to his youth  Gave his strong sanction to th' Historian's truth  Oh Italy tho' drench'd with civil blood  Tho' drown'd in Bigotry's soulquenching flood  Historic Genius in thy troubles nurst  Ev'n from the darkness of the Convent burst  Venice may boast eternal Honour won  By the bright labours of her dauntless Son  Whose hand the curtains of the Conclave drew  And gave each priestly art to public view  SARPI blest name from every foible clear  Ver See NOTE XII  Not more to Science than to Virtue dear  Thy pen thy life of equal praise secure  Both wisely bold and both sublimely pure  That Freedom bids me on thy merits dwell  Whose radiant form illum'd thy letter'd cell  Who to thy hand the noblest task assign'd  That earth can offer to a heavenly mind  With Reason's arms to guard invaded laws  And guide the pen of Truth in Freedom's cause  Too firm of heart at Danger's cry to stoop  Nor Lucre's slave nor vain Ambition's dupe  Thro' length of days invariably the same  Thy Country's liberty thy constant aim  For this thy spirit dar'd th' Assassin's knife  That with repeated guilt pursu'd thy life  For this thy fervent and unweary'd care  Form'd ev'n in death thy patriotic prayer  And while his shadows on thine eyelids hung  "Be it immortal" trembled on thy tongue  But not restricted by the partial Fates  To the bright cluster of Italian States  The light of Learning and of liberal Taste  Diffusely shone o'er Europe's Gothic waste  On Tagus' shore from whose admiring strand  Great GAMA fail'd when his advent'rous hand  The flag of glorious enterprize unfurl'd  To purchase with his toils the Eastern world  The clear OSORIUS in his classic phrase  Ver See NOTE XIII  Portray'd the Heroes of those happier days  When Lusitania once a mighty name  Outstripp'd each rival in the chace of Fame  Mild and majestic her Historian's page  Shares in the glory of her brightest age  Iberia's Genius bids just Fame allow  An equal wreath to MARIANA's brow  Ver See NOTE XIV  Skill'd to illuminate the distant scene  In diction graceful and of spirit keen  His labour by his country's love endear'd  The gloomy chaos of her Story clear'd  He first aspir'd its scatter'd parts to class  And bring to juster form the mighty mass  As the nice hand of Geographic art  Draws the vast globe on a contracted chart  Where Truth uninjur'd sees with glad surprize  Her shape still perfect tho' of smaller size  Exalted Mind who felt the People's right  In climes where souls are crush'd by Kingly might  And dar'd unaw'd before a tyrant's throne  To make the sanctity of Freedom known  But short O Genius is thy transient hour  In the dark regions of despotic Power  As the saint struggle of the solar beam  When vapours intercept the golden stream  Pouring thro' parted clouds a glancing fire  Plays in short triumph on some glittering spire  But while the eye admires the partial ray  The pale and watery lustre melts away  Thus gleams of literary splendor play'd  And thus on Spain's o'erclouded realm decay'd  While happier France with longer glory bright  Caught richer flashes of the flying light  There with the dignity of virtuous Pride  Thro' painful scenes of public service try'd  And keenly conscious of his Country's woes  The liberal spirit of THUANUS rose  Ver See NOTE XV  O'er Earth's wide stage a curious eye he cast  And caught the living pageant as it past  With patriot care most eager to advance  The rights of Nature and the weal of France  His language noble as his temper clear  From Faction's rage and Superstition's fear  In Wealth laborious amid Wrongs sedate  His Virtue lovely as his Genius great  Ting'd with some marks that from his climate spring  He priz'd his Country but ador'd his King  Yet with a zeal from slavish awe refin'd  Shone the clear model of a Gallic mind  Thou friend of Science 'twas thy signal praise  A just memorial of

blame thy King tho' rob'd in Honour's ray  Who left thy Fame to subtle Priests a prey  And tamely saw their murky wiles o'erwhelm  Thy works the light of his reviving realm  Tho' Pontiffs execrate and Kings betray  Let not this fate your generous warmth allay  Ye kindred Worthies who still dare to wield  Reason's keen sword and Toleration's shield  In climes where Persecution's iron mace  Is rais'd

elegantly terse  Flames with bold spirit yet is idly rash  Thy promis'd light is oft a dazzling flash  Thy Wisdom verges to sarcastic sport  Satire thy joy and ridicule thy  fort  But the gay Genius

confide  The slaves of Fancy and the dupes of Pride  Each petty region of the peopled earth  Howe'er debas'd by intellectual dearth  Still proudly boasted of her claims to share  The richest portion of celestial care  For her she saw the rival Gods engage  And Heaven convuls'd with elemental rage  To her the thunder's roar the lightning's fire  Confirm'd their favour or denounc'd their ire  To seize this foible daring Hist'ry threw  Illusive terrors o'er each scene she drew  Nor would her spirit in the heat of youth  Watch with a Vestal's care the lamp of Truth  But wildly mounting in a

Demands a firm an independent soul  An eagleeye that with undazzled gaze  Can look on Majesty's meridian blaze  But Adulation in the worst of times  Throws her broad mantle o'er imperial crimes  In

Pleas'd to promote the welfare of mankind  And by informing meliorate the mind  Such the bright task committed to his care  Boundless its use but its completion rare  Critics have said "Tho' high th'

Epicure in Wit  And Knowledge must his nicer taste beguile  With all the poignant charms of Attic style  The curious Scholar in his judgment choice  Expects no common Notes from History's voice  But all the tones that all the passions suit  From the bold Trumpet to the tender Lute  Yet if thro' Music's scale her voice should range  Now high now low with many a pleasing change  Grace must thro'

fields of Time and Space  To shew each wheel of Power in all its force  And trace the streams of Action from their source  To catch with spirit and precision join'd  The varying features of the human

sands of Syria lay  The Desart blaz'd with sudden glory bright  And rich Palmyra rush'd upon his sight  But O what foes beset each honour'd Name  Advancing in the path of letter'd fame  To stop thy progress and insult thy pen  The fierce Polemic issues from his den  Think not my Verse means blindly to engage  In rash defence of thy profaner page  Tho' keen her spirit her attachment fond  Base service cannot suit with Friendship's bond  Too firm from Duty's sacred path to turn  She breathes an honest sigh of deep concern  And pities Genius when his wild career  Gives Faith a wound or

their Vigour and their Use they owe  Nor scorns fair Virtue this untainted source  From hence she often draws her lovely force  For Heaven this passion with our life combin'd  Which like a central power impels the languid mind  When clear from Envy's cloud that general pest  It burns most brightly in the Author's breast  Its soothing hopes his various pains beguile  And give to Learning's face her sweetest smile  What joy to think his Genius may create  Existence far beyond the common date  His Wealth of Mind to latest ages give  And in Futurity's affection live  From unborn Beauty still to Fancy dear  Draw with soft magic the delightful tear  Or thro' the bosom of far distant Youth  Spread the warm glow of Liberty and Truth  O GIBBON by thy frank ambition taught  Let me like thee maintain th' enlivening thought  That from Oblivion's killing cloud secure  My Hope may prosper and my Verse endure  While thy bright Name on History's car sublime  Rolls in just triumph o'er the

Praise and Censure stand  Two urns by Jove's high throne have ever stood  The source of evil one and one of good  POPE's Iliad xxiv v  NOTE II VERSE  Yet one excelling Greek  c Dionysius of Halicarnassus the celebrated historian and critic of the Augustan age who settled in Italy as he himself informs us on the close of the civil war He has addressed a little treatise containing a critique on the elder historians to his friend Cnaeus Pompeius whom the French critics  suppose to be Pompey the Great but Reiske the last editor of Dionysius has sunk him into a petty Greek grammarian the client or freedman of that illustrious Roman  In this treatise of Dionysius and in one still longer on the character of Thucydides there are some excellent historical precepts which Mr Spelman has judiciously thrown together in the preface to his admirable translation of the Roman Antiquities He introduces them by the following observation which may serve perhaps to recommend the subject of the present poem "So much has been said both by the antients and the moderns in praise of the advantages resulting from the study of History particularly by Diodorus Siculus among the former in the noble preface to his Historical Collections and by the late Lord Bolingbroke among the moderns in his admirable letter on that subject that I am astonished no treatise has ever yet appeared in any age or any language professedly written to prescribe rules for writing History a work allowed to be of the greatest advantage of all others to mankind the repository of truth fraught with lessons both of public and private virtue and enforced by stronger motives than preceptsby examples Rules for Poetry and Rhetoric have been written by many authors both antient and modern as if delight and eloquence were of greater consequence than instruction however Rhetoric was a part of History as treated by the antients not the principal part indeed but subservient to the principal and calculated to apply the facts exhibited by the narration I know it may be said that many antient histories are still preserved and that these models are sufficient guides for modern Historians without particular rules so had the Greeks Poets of all denominations in their hands and yet Aristotle thought it necessary to prescribe particular rules to his countrymen for applying those examples to every branch of Poetry I wish he had done the same in History if he had it is very probable that his precepts would have rendered  the best of our modern Histories more perfect and the worst less abominableSince the resurrection of letters the want of such a guide has been complained of by many authors and particularly by Rapin in the preface to his History of England"Spelman page But this ingenious and learned writer speaks a little too strongly in saying no treatise has ever appeared in any age or language containing rules for History There is one in Latin by the celebrated Vossius entitled Ars Historica another by Hubertus Folieta an elegant Latin writer of the th century on whom Thuanus bestows the highest commendation and Mascardi an Italian critic patronised by Cardinal Mazarine has written also dell Arte Historica The curious reader may find a singular anecdote relating to the publication of this work in Bayle under the article Mascardi But to return to Dionysius in comparing Herodotus and Thucydides He censures the latter with a degree of severity unwarranted by truth and reason indeed this severity appeared so striking to the learned Fabricius that he seems to consider it as a kind of proof that the critical works of Dionysius were composed in the hasty fervor of youth They are however in general to use the words of the same ingenuous author eximia lectu digna and a valuable critic of our own country who resembles Dionysius in elegance of composition and perhaps in severity of judgment has spoken yet more warmly in their favourSee Warton's Essay on Pope d edit page  NOTE III VERSE  And Lucian thou of Humour's sons supreme  The little treatise of Lucian "How History should be written" may be considered as one of the most valuable productions of that lively author it is not only written with great vivacity and wit but is entitled to the  superior praise of breathing most exalted sentiments of liberty and virtue There is a peculiar kind of sublimity in his description of an accomplished Historian    It is a piece of justice due to our own country to remark that in the d volume of the World there is a ludicrous essay on History by Mr Cambridge which is written with all the spirit and all the humour of Lucian  NOTE IV VERSE  And rose a Xenophon in selfesteem      LUCIAN edit Riollay p  NOTE V VERSE  In Egypt once a dread tribunal stood  This singular institution which is alluded to by many of our late authors is related at large in the First Book of Diodorus Siculus and as the passage is curious the following free translation of it may afford entertainment to the English reader"Those who prepare to bury a relation give notice of the day intended for the ceremony to the judges and to all the friends of the deceased informing them that the body will pass over the lake of that district to which the dead belonged  when on the judges being assembled to the number of more than forty and ranging themselves in a semicircle on the farther side of the lake the vessel is set afloat which those who superintend the funeral have prepared for this purpose This vessel is managed by a pilot called in the Egyptian language Charon and hence they say that Orpheus travelling in old times into Egypt and seeing this ceremony formed his fable of the infernal regions partly from what he saw and partly from invention The vessel being launched on the lake before the coffin which contains the body is put on board the law permits all who are so inclined to produce an accusation against itIf any one steps forth and proves that the deceased has led an evil life the judges pronounce sentence and the body is precluded from burial but if the accuser is convicted of injustice in his charge he falls himself under a considerable penalty When no accuser appears or when the accuser is proved to be an unfair one the relations who are assembled change their expressions of sorrow into encomiums on the dead yet they do not like the Greeks speak in honour of his family because they consider all Egyptians as equally wellborn but they set forth the education and manners of his youth his piety and justice in maturer

vast abodes  Whose mighty mass the land of Egypt loads  This account of the Pyramids I have adopted from the very learned Mr Bryant part of whose ingenious observation upon them I shall here present to the reader  One great purpose in all eminent and expensivestructures is to please the stranger and traveller and to win their admiration This  is effected sometimes by a mixture of magnificence and beauty at other times solely by immensity and grandeur The latter seems to have been the object in the erecting of those celebrated buildings in Egypt and they certainly have answered the design For not only the vastness of their structure and the area which they occupy but the ages they have endured and the very uncertainty of their history which runs so far back into the depths of antiquity produce altogether a wonderful veneration to which buildings more exquisite and embellished are seldom entitled Many have supposed that they were designed for places of sepulture and it has been affirmed by Herodotus and other ancient writers But they spoke by guess and I have shewn by many instances how usual it was for the Grecians to mistake temples for tombs If the chief Pyramid were designed for a place of burial what occasion was there for a well and for passages of communication which led to other buildings Near the Pyramids are apartments of a wonderful fabric which extend in length one thousand four hundred feet and about thirty in depth They have been cut out of the hard rock and brought to a perpendicular by the artist's chizel and through dint of labour fashioned as they now appear They were undoubtedly designed for the reception of priests and consequently were not appendages to a tomb but to a temple of the Deity The priests of Egypt delighted in obscurity and they probably came by the subterraneous passages of the building to the dark chambers within where they performed their lustrations and other nocturnal rites Many of the ancient temples in this country were caverns in the rocks enlarged by art and cut out into numberless dreary apartments for no nation upon earth was so addicted to gloom and melancholy as the Egyptians  BRYANT's Analysis Vol

appellation of The Father of History was born in Halicarnassus a city of Caria four years before the invasion of Xerxes in the year before Christ The time and place of his death are uncertain but his countryman Dionysius informs us that he lived to the beginning of the Peloponnesian war and Marcellinus the Greek author who wrote a life of Thucydides affirms there was a monument erected to these two great Historians in a burialplace belonging to the family of Miltiades  There is hardly any author antient of modern who has been more warmly commended or more vehemently censured than this

the most violent attack on his veracity allows him all  the merit of beautiful composition From the heavy charges brought against him by the antients the famous Henry Stephens and his learned friend Camerarius have defended their favourite Historian with great spirit But Herodotus has found a more formidable antagonist in a learned and animated writer of our own times to whom the public have been lately indebted for his having opened to them new mines of Oriental learningIf the ingenious Mr Richardson could effectually support his Persian system the great Father of the Grecian story must sink into a fabulist as low in point of veracity as Geoffrey of Monmouth It must be owned that several eminent Writers of our country have treated him as such Another Orientalist who in his elegant Preface to the Life of Nader Shaw has drawn a spirited and judicious sketch of many capital Historians declares in passing judgment on Herodotus that "his accounts of the Persian affairs are at least doubtful if not fabulous"Hume I think goes still farther and says in one of his essays"The first page of Thucydides is in my opinion the commencement of real History" For my own part I confess myself more

the capital Greek Historians I cannot help observing that our language has been greatly enriched in the course of the present century by such translations of these Authors as do great honour to our country and are at least equal to any which other nations have produced  In the chief Roman Historians we seem to have been less fortunate but from the specimen which Mr Aikin has lately given  the public in the smaller pieces of Tacitus we may hope to see an excellent version of that valuable author who has been hitherto ill treated in our language and among all the antients there is none perhaps whom it is more difficult to translate with fidelity and spirit  NOTE XVI VERSE  Sententious Sallust leads her lofty train  This celebrated Historian who from the irregularity of his life and

restored by the interest of Julius Caesar who gave him the command of Numidia which province he is said to have plundered by the most infamous extortion purchasing with part of this treasure those rich and extensive possessions on the Quirinal Hill so celebrated by the name of the Horti SallustianiHe died in the th year of his age four years before the battle of Actium and before the Christian aera His enmity to Cicero is well known and perhaps it had some influence on the peculiarity of his dictionpersonal animosity might make him endeavour to form a style as remote as possible from the redundant language of the immortal Orator whose turbulent wife Terentia he is said to have married after her divorce This extraordinary woman is reported to have lived to the age of to have married Messala her third husband and Vibius Rufus her fourthThe latter boasted with the joy of an Antiquarian that he possessed two of the greatest curiosities in the world namely Terentia who had been

happily remain entire are sufficient to justify the great encomiums he has received as a writerHe has had the singular honour to be twice translated by a royal handfirst by our Elizabeth according to

thisthat he was born at Patavium the modern Padua that he was chosen by Augustus to superintend the education of the stupid Claudius that he was rallied by the Emperor for his attachment to the cause of the Republic and that he died in his own country in the th year of Tiberius at the age of There is a passage in one of Pliny's letters which as it shews the high and extensive reputation of our Historian during his life I shall present to the reader in the words of Pliny's most elegant translator"Do you remember to have read of a certain inhabitant of the city of Cadiz who was so struck with the illustrious character of Livy that he travelled to Rome on purpose to see that great Genius and as soon as he had satisfied his curiosity returned home again"MELMOTH's Pliny Vol I Page A veneration still more extraordinary was paid to this great author by Alphonse  King of Naples who in sent Panormita as his Ambassador to the Venetians in whose dominion the bones of Livy had been lately discovered to beg a relic of this celebrated Historian They presented him with an armbone and the Present is recorded in an inscription preserved at Padua which the curious reader may find in Vossius de Historicis Latinis This singular anecdote is also related in Bayle under the article PanormitaLearning perhaps never sustained a greater loss in any single author than by the destruction of the latter and more interesting part of Livy Several eminent moderns have indulged the pleasing expectation that the entire work of this noble Historian might yet be recovered It has been said to exist in an Arabic version and even a compleat copy of the original is supposed to have been extant as late as the year and to have perished at that time in the plunder of MagdeburghThat munificent patron of learning Leo the Xth exerted the most generous zeal to rescue from oblivion the valuable treasure which one of his most bigotted predecessors Gregory the Great had expelled from every

according to the conjecture of Lipsius in the close of the reign of Claudius passing through various public honours he rose at length to the consular dignity under Nerva in the year of Christ The date of his death is unknown but he is said to have lived happily to an advanced age with his wife the amiable daughter of the virtuous Agricola whose life he has so beautifully written By this lady he is supposed to have left children and the emperor Tacitus is conjectured to have been a remote descendant from the Historian to whose works and memory he paid the highest regardIt is reported by Sidonius Apollinaris that Tacitus recommended the province of writing History to Pliny the Younger and that he did not himself engage in that employment till his friend had declined it This is not mentioned indeed in any of the beautiful letters still remaining from Pliny to Tacitus but it is an instance of delicacy not unparallel'd among the Antients as will appear from the following remark by one of the most elegant and liberal of modern critics"The Roman Poet who was not more eminent by his genius than amiable in his moral character affords perhaps the most remarkable instance that any where occurs of the concessions which a mind strongly impregnated with sentiments of genuine amity is capable of making Virgil's superior talents rendered him qualified to excel in all the nobler species of poetical composition nevertheless from the most uncommon delicacy of friendship he sacrificed to his intimacy with Horace the unrivall'd reputation he might have acquired by indulging his lyric vein as from the same refined motive he forbore to exercise his dramatic  powers that he might not obscure the glory of his friend Varius  Aurum et opes et rura frequens donabit amicus  Qui velit  ingenio

all the refined and affectionate feelings of the heart in a very high degree though the general cast of his historical works might lead us to imagine that austerity was his chief characteristicIt would be easy to fill a volume in transcribing the great encomiums and the violent censures which have been lavished by modern writers of almost every country on this profound HistorianThe last critic of eminence who has written against him in Britain is I believe the learned Author of The Origin and Progress of Language who in his d volume of that work has made many curious remarks on the composition of the antient Historians and is particularly severe on the diction of Tacitus He represents him as the defective model from which modern writers have copied what he is pleased to call  "the short and priggish cut of style so much in use now"  NOTE XX VERSE  Thy Plutarch shines by moral beauty known  It is to be wished that this most amiable Moralist and Biographer had added a Life of himself to those which he has given to the world as the particulars which other Writers have preserved of his personal History are very doubtful and imperfect According to the learned Fabricius  he was born under Claudius years after the Christian aera raised to the consular dignity under Trajan whose preceptor he is said to have been and made Procurator of Greece in his old age by the Emperor Adrianin the th year of whose reign he is supposed to have died at the age of He was married to a most amiable woman of his own native town Chaeronea whose name was Timoxena and to whose sense and virtue he has borne the most affectionate testimony in his moral works of which it may be regretted that we have no elegant translation Indeed even the Lives of Plutarch the most popular of all the antient historical compositions were chiefly known to the English reader by a motley and miserable version till a new one executed with fidelity and spirit was presented to the public by the

unknownBayle has an article on Marcellinus in which he observes that he has introduced a most bitter invective against the Practitioners of Law into his HistoryHe should have added that the Historian bestows great encomiums on some illustrious characters of that profession and even mentions the peculiar hardship to which Advocates are themselves exposedThe curious reader may find this passage Lib

books first published very imperfectly by Haeschelius in and since printed in the collection of the Byzantine Historians with a diffuse and incorrect Latin version by the Jesuit Possinus but with excellent notes by the learned Du Fresne  Considering the miseries of the time in which she lived and the merits of her workwhich some Critics have declared superior to every other in that voluminous collectionthis Lady may be justly regarded as a singular phaenomenon in the literary world and as this mention of her may possibly excite the curiosity of my fair Readers I shall close the Notes to this Epistle with presenting to them a Translation of the Preface to her History as I believe no part of her Works have yet appeared in any modern language I found that I could not abridge it without injuring its beauty and though long I flatter myself it will escape the censure of being tedious as she feelingly displays in it the misfortunes of her life and the character of her mind  THE PREFACE OF THE PRINCESS ANNA COMNENA FROM THE GREEK Prefixed to her ALEXIAD or History of her Father the Emperor ALEXIUS  TIME which flows irresistibly ever encroaching and stealing something from human life seems to bear away all that is mortal into a gulph darkness sometimes destroying such things as  deserve not utterly to be forgotten and sometimes such as are most noble and most worthy of remembrance Now to use the words of the tragic poet  Sophocles    Discovering things invisible and now  Sweeping each present object from our sight  But History forms the strongest barrier against this tide of Time it withstands in some measure the violence of the torrent and by collecting and cementing such things as appear worthy of preservation while they are hurried along the stream it allows them not to sink into the abyss of oblivion  On this consideration I Anna the daughter of the emperor Alexius and his consort Irene born and educated in imperial splendornot utterly void of literature and solicitous to distinguish myself by that Grecian characteristicas I have already applied myself to Rhetoric and having thoroughly studied the Principles of Aristotle and the Dialogues of Plato have endeavoured to adorn my mind with the  Astrology Geometry Arithmetic and Music  four usual branches of education for I think it incumbent on me even at the risque of appearing vain to declare what qualifications for the present task I have received from nature or gained by application what Providence has bestowed upon me or time and opportunity supplied On these accounts I am desirous of commemorating in my present work the actions of my father as they deserve not to be buried in silence or to be plunged as it were by the tide of Time into the ocean of Oblivion both those actions which he performed after he obtained the diadem and those before that period while he was himself a subject of other Princes I engage in this narration not so much to display any little talent for composition  as to prevent transactions of such importance from perishing unrecorded since even the brightest of human atchievements if not consigned to memory under the guard of writing are extinguished as it were by the Darkness of Silence  My father was a man who knew both how to govern and to pay to governors a becoming obedience but in chusing his actions for my subject I am apprehensive in the very outset of my work lest I may be censured as the Panegyrist of my own family for writing of my father that if I speak of him with admiration my whole History will be considered as a false an flattering encomium and if any circumstance I may have occasion to mention leads me as it were by force to disapprove some part even of his conduct I am apprehensive on the other hand not from the character of my father but from the very nature of things that some malignant censurers may compare me to Cham the son of Noah since there are many whom envy and malevolence will not suffer to form a fair judgment and who to speak in the words of Homer  Are keen to censure where no blame is due  For whoever engages in the province of History is bound to forget all sentiments both of favour and aversion and often to adorn his enemies with the highest commendations when their actions are entitled to such reward and often to censure his most intimate friends when the failings of their life and manners require it These are duties equally incumbent on the Historian which he cannot decline As to myself with regard to those who may be affected either by my censure or my praise I would wish to assure them that I speak both of them and their conduct according to the evidence of their actions themselves or the report of those who beheld them for either the fathers or the grandfathers of many persons now living were ocular witnesses of what I shall  record I have been chiefly led to engage in this History of my father by the following circumstanceIt was my fortune to marry Caesar Nicephorus of the Bryennian family a man far superior to all his cotemporaries not only in personal beauty but in sublimity of understanding and all the charms of eloquence for he was equally the admiration of those who saw and those who heard him But that my discourse may not wander from its present purpose let me proceed in my narrationHe was then among all men the most distinguished and when he marched with the emperor John Comnenus my brother on his expedition against Antioch and other places in possession of the Barbarians still unable to abstain from literary pursuits even in those scenes of labour and fatigue he wrote various compositions worthy of remembrance and of honour But he chiefly applied himself to the writing an account of what related to my father Alexius emperor of the Romans at the request of the empress reducing into proper form the transactions of his reign whenever the times would allow him to devote short intervals of leisure from arms and battle to works of literature and the labour of composition In forming this History he deduced his accounts from an early period being directed in this point also by the instruction of our royal mistress beginning from the emperor Diogenes and descending to the person whom he had chosen for the Hero of his Dramafor this season first shewed my father to be a youth of expectation Before this period he was a mere infant and of course performed nothing worthy of being recorded unless even the occurrences of his childhood should be thought a fit subject for History Such then was the design and scope of Caesar's composition but he fail'd in the hope he had entertained of bringing his History to its conclusion for having brought it to the times of the emperor Nicephorus Botoniates he there broke off having no future opportunity allowed him of continuing his narration a circumstance  which has proved a severe loss to Literature and robbed his readers of delightOn this account I have undertaken to record the actions of my father that such atchievements may not escape posterity What degree of harmony and grace the writings of Caesar possessed all persons know who have been fortunate enough to see his compositions But having executed his work to the period I have mentioned in the midst of hurry and fatigue and bringing it to us half finished from his expedition he brought home alas at he same time a disorder that proved mortal contracted perhaps from the hardships of his passage or perhaps from that harrassing scene of perpetual action and possibly indeed from his infinite anxiety on my account for anxiety was natural to his affectionate heart and his labours were without intermission Moreover the change and badness of climates might prepare for him this draught of death For notwithstanding the dreadful state of his health he persevered in the campaign against the Syrians and Cilicians till at length he was conveyed out of Syria in a most infirm state and was brought through Cilicia Pamphylia Lydia and Bithynia home to the metropolis of the empire and to his family But his vitals were now affected by his infinite fatigue Even in this state of weakness he was desirous of displaying the events of his expedition but this his disorder rendered him unable to execute and indeed we enjoined him not to attempt it lest by the effort of such a narration he should burst open his wound But in the recollection of these things my whole soul is darkened and my eyes are covered with a flood of tearsO what a director of the Roman counsels was then torn from us O what an end was there to all the treasures of clear of various and of useful knowledge which he had collected from observation and experience both in regard to foreign affairs and the internal business of the empire O what a form was then destroyedBeauty that seemed not only entitled to dominion but bearing even the  semblance of divinityI indeed have been conversant with every calamity and have found even from the imperial cradle an unpropitious fortune some perhaps might esteem that fortune not unpropitious which seemed to smile upon my birth in giving me sovereigns for my parents and nursing me in the imperial purple but for the other circumstances of my life alas what tempests alas what perturbations The melody of Orpheus affected even inanimate nature and Timotheus in playing the Orthic song to Alexander made the Macedon start to arms  The relation of my miseries would not indeed produce such effects but it would move every auditor to tears it would force not only beings endued with sensibility but even inanimate nature to sympathize in my sorrowThis remembrance of Caesar and his unexpected death tears open the deepest wound of my soul Indeed I consider all my former misfortunes if compared to this immeasureable calamity but as a drop of water to the Atlantic sea or rather my earlier afflictions were a kind of prelude to this they first involved me as it were like a smoke preceding this raging fire they were a kind of heat that portended a conflagration which no words can describe O thou fire that blazest without fuel preying on my heart without destroying its existence piercing through my very bones and shrinking up my soul But I perceive myself hurried away from my subject this mention of Caesar and what I suffer in his loss has led me into the prolixity of grief wiping therefore the tear from my eyes and restraining myself from this indulgence of sorrow I will proceed in order yet as the  Euripides  tragic Poet says  Still adding tear to tear  as recollecting misfortune after misfortune for the entering on the History of such a king so eminent for his virtues revives  in my mind all the wonders he performed which move me to fresh tears and these I share in common with all the world for the remembrance of him and the recital of his reign supplies to me a new subject of lamentation and must remind others of the loss they have sustained  But let me at length begin the History of my father from the period most propernow the most proper period is that which will give to my narration the clearest and most historical appearance

his style considering the age in which he wroteSuberat alia non irrationabilis ut opinor causa quae vel sola sufficere posset ut me ad haec soribenda compelleret nutrimentum videlicet in me impensum

prefixed to Mr Warton's History of English Poetry gives the most perfect account of this famous old Chronicler and his whimsical performance"About the year Gualter Archdeacon of Oxford a learned man and a diligent collector of Histories travelling through France procured in Armorica an antient Chronicle written in the British or Armorican language entitled  BrutyBrenhined  or the History of the Kings of Britain This book he brought into England and communicated it to Geoffrey of Monmouth a Welsh Benedictine  Monk an elegant writer of Latin and admirably skilled in the British tongue Geoffrey at the request and recommendation of Gualter the Archdeacon translated this British Chronicle into Latin executing the Translation with a tolerable degree of purity and great fidelity yet not without some interpolationsIt was probably finished after the year ""The simple subject of this Chronicle divested of its romantic embellishments is a deduction of the Welsh Princes from the Trojan Brutus to Cadwallader who reigned in the seventh century" To this extract from Mr Warton it may be proper to add a concise account of that romantic embellishment to which I have particularly alludedUther Pendragon at the festival of his coronation falls in love with Igerna the wife of Gorlois Duke of Cornwall and being prevented from pursuing his addresses by the vigilance of the husband he applies to the magical power of Merlin for the completion of his desire This he obtains by being transformed into the person of Gorlois and thus introducing himself to the deluded Igerna as Jupiter visited

native of Somersetshire and is supposed to have received his education at Oxford He is justly called by almost every writer on English  History the most liberal and judicious of all our monastic Historians His principal work is a History of our Kings from the arrival of the Saxons to the th year of Henry the First This was followed by two books of later History which close with the celebrated escape of the Empress Matilda from the Castle of Oxford These works are both addressed to that munificent patron of merit Robert Earl of Gloucester natural son of Henry the First who was perhaps the most exalted and accomplished character that ever flourished in so barbarous an age The Historian speaks of his noble friend with all the simplicity of truth and all the warmth of virtuous admiration He died according to Pitts in three years before his generous patron and this is probable from his not pursuing his History which he intimates a design of resumingYet there is a passage preserved in Tanner from the Preface to his Comments on Jeremiah which seems to prove that he lived to a later period since he mentions his historical works as the production of his younger days and speaks of his age as devoted to religious composition Besides his four books de gestis Pontificum Anglorum he wrote many works of the same pious turn which the curious reader may see enumerated in Tanner's Bibliotheca  NOTE VIII VERSE  A faithful Chronicler in plain Froissart  John Froissart Canon and Treasurer of the collegiate church of Chimay in Henault was born at Valenciennes a city of that province in according to the conjecture of that elaborate and ingenious antiquarian Mr de St Palaye who has amply illustrated the Life and Writings of this engaging Historian in a series of dissertations among the Memoirs of the French Academy Vol X St Palaye imagines from a passage in the MS Poems of Froissart that his father was a painter of Armoriesand it is certain the Historian discovers a  passion for all the pomp and all the minutiae of heraldry of that martial age and Froissart more the priest of gallantry than of religion devoted himself entirely to the celebration of love and war At the age of he began to write History at the request  de son eber Seigneur Maitre Messire  Robert de Namur Chevalier Seigneur de BeaufortThe anguish of unsuccessful love drove him early into England and his first voyage seems a kind of emblem of his future life for he sailed hither in a storm yet continued writing a rondeau in spite of the tempest till he found himself on that coast ou l'on aime mieux la guerre que la paix ou les estrangers sont trèsbien venus as he said of our country  in his verses  and happily experienced in his kind reception at court where Philippa of Henault the Queen of Edward the Third and a Patroness of learning distinguished the young Historian her countryman by the kindest protection and finding that love had rendered him unhappy supplied him with money and with horses that he might present himself with every advantage before the object of his passionLove soon escorted him to his mistressbut his addresses were again unsuccessful and taking a second voyage to England he became Secretary to his royal patroness Philippa in after having presented to her some portion of his HistoryHe continued five years in her service entertaining her majesty  de beaux dictiez traictez amoureux  in this period he paid a visit to Scotland and was entertained days by William Earl DouglasIn when Edward the Black Prince was preparing for the war in Spain Froissart was with him in Gascony and hoped to attend him during the whole course of that important expeditionbut the Prince sent him back to the Queen his motherHe continued not long in England as he visited many of the Italian courts in the following year and during his travels sustained the irreparable loss of that patroness to whose bounty he had been so much indebtedPhilippa died and Froissart is reported to have  written the life of his amiable protectress but of this performance the researches of St Palaye could discover no trace  After this event he retired to his own country and obtained the benefice of Lestines in the diocese of CambrayBut the cure of souls was an office little suited to the gay and gallant Froissart His genius led him still to travel from castle to castle and from court to court to use the words of Mr Warton who has made occasional mention of our author in his elegant History of English PoetryFroissart now entered into the service of the Duke of Brabant and as that Prince was himself a poet Froissart collected all the compositions of his master and adding some of his own formed a kind of romance which he calls  Un Livre de Meliador  Le Chevalier au soleil d'or  and of which in one of his later poems he gives the following account  Dedans ce Romant sont encloses  Toutes les chançons que jadis  Dont l'ame soit en paradis  Que fit le bon Duc de Braibant  Wincelaus dont on parla tant  Car un prince fu amorous  Gracious chevalerous  Et le livre me fit ja faire  Par très grant amoureus à faire  Coment qu'il ne le veist oncques  The Duke died in before this work was completed and Froissart soon found a new patron in Guy earl of Blois on the marriage of whose Son he wrote a Pastoral entitled Le Temple d'HonneurThe earl having requested him to resume his History  he travelled for that purpose to the celebrated court of Gaston earl of Foix whose high reputation for every knightly virtue attracted to his residence at Orlaix those martial adventurers from whose mouth it was the delight of Froissart to collect the materials of his HistoryThe courteous Gaston gave him the most flattering reception he said to him with a smile en bon François "qu'il le connoissoit bien quoyqu'il ne l'eust jamais veu mais qu'il avoit bien oui parler de luy le retint de son hostel"It became a favourite amusement of the Earl to hear Froissart read his Romance of Meliador after supperHe attended in the castle every night at when the Earl sate down to table listened to him with extreme attention and never dismissed him till he had made him vuider tout ce qui estoit resté du vin de sa boucheFroissart gained much information here not only from his patron who was himself very communicative but from various Knights of Arragon and England in the retinue of the Duke of Lancaster who then resided at BordeauxAfter a long residence in this brilliant court and after receiving a present from the liberal Gaston which he mentions in the following verses  Je pris congé li bons Contes  Me fit par sa chambre des comptes  Delivrer quatrevins florins  D'Arragon tous pesans fins  Et mon livre qu'il m'ot laissé  Froissart departed in the train of the Countess of Boulogne related to the earl of Foix and just leaving him to join her new husband the Duke of BerryIn this expedition our Historian was robbed near Avignon and laments the unlucky adventure in a very long poem from which Mr de St Palaye has drawn many particulars of his life The groundwork of this poem which is not in the list of our Author's poetical pieces that Mr Warton has given us from Pasquier seems to have a strong vein of humourIt is a  dialogue between the Poet and the single Florin that he has left out of the many which he had either spent or been obliged to surrender to the robbersHe represents himself as a man of the most expensive turn in years he had squandered two thousand franks besides his ecclesiastical revenues The composition of his works had cost him but he regretted not this sum as he expected to be amply repaid for it by the praise of posterity  After having attended all the festivals on the marriage of the Duke of Berry having traversed many parts of France and paid a visit to Zeland he returned to his own country in to continue his History from the various materials he had collectedBut not satisfied with the relations he had heard of the war in Spain he went to Middlebourgh in Zeland in pursuit of a Portugueze Knight Jean Ferrand Portelet vaillant homme sage du Conseil du Roy de Portugal From this accomplished soldier Froissart expected the most perfect information as an ocular witness of those scenes which he now wished to recordThe courteous Portelet received our indefatigable Historian with all the kindness which his enthusiasm deserved and in six days which they passed together gave him all the intelligence he desiredFroissart now returned home and finished the third book of his HistoryMany years had past since he had bid adieu to England taking advantage of the truce then established between France and that country he paid it another visit in with letters of recommendation to the King and his unclesFrom Dover he proceeded to Canterbury to pay his devoirs at the shrine of Thomas of Becket and to the memory of the Black PrinceHere he happened to find the son of that hero the young King Richard whom devotion had also brought to make his offerings to the fashionable Saint and return thanks to Heaven for his successes in IrelandFroissart speaks of this adventure and his own feelings on the great change of scene that had taken place since his last visit to England in the following natural and lively termsLe Roy vint a trez grant arroy et bien accompaigne  de seignneurs de dames et demoiselles et me mis entre eulx entre elles et tout me sembla nouvel ne je ny congnoissoye personne car le tems estoit bien change en Angleterre depuis le tems de vingt huyt ans et en la compagnie du roy n'avoit nuls de ses oncles si fus du premier ainsi que tout esbahy Tho' Froissart was thus embarrassed in not finding one of his old friends in the retinue of the King he soon gained a new Patron in Thomas Percy Master of the Household who offered to present him and his letters to Richard but this offer happening on the eve of the King's departure it proves too late for the ceremony Le Roy estoit retrait pour aller dormirAnd on the morrow when the impatient Historian attended early at the Archbishop's palace where the king slept his friend Percy advised him to wait a more convenient season for being introduced to RichardFroissart acquiesced in this advice and was consoled for his disappointment by falling into company with an English Knight who had attended the King in Ireland and was very willing to gratify the curiosity of the Historian by a relation of his adventureThis was William de Lisle who entertained him as they rode along together with the marvels of St Patrick's Cave in which he assured him he had passed a night and seen wonderful visionsThough our honest Chronicler is commonly accused of a passion for the marvellous with an excess of credulity he says very sensibly on this occasion de cette matiere je ne luy parlay plus avant et m'en cessay car voulentiers je luy eusse demande du voyage d'Irlande et luy eu voulaye parler et mettre en voyeIt appears plainly from this passage that our Historian was more anxious to gain information concerning the scenes of real action than to listen to the extravagant fictions of a popular legendBut here he was again disappointedNew companions joined them on the road and their historical conference was thus interruptedThese mortifications were soon repaid by the kind reception he met with from the Duke of York who said to him when he received the recommendatory  letter from the Earl of Henault "Maistre Jehan tenez vous toujour deles nous nos gens nous vous ferons tout amour courtoisie nous y sommes tenus pour l'amour du tems passé de notre dame de mere à qui vous futes nous en avons bien la souvenance"With these flattering marks of remembrance and favour the Duke presented him to the King lequel me receut joyeusement et doulcement continues Froissart et ne dist que je fusse le bien venus et si j'avoye este de l'hostel du Roy son Ayeul de Madame son Ayeule encores estoys je de l'hostel d'Angleterre Some time however elapsed before he had an opportunity of presenting his romance of Meliador which he had prepared for the KingThe Duke of York and his other friends at length obtained for him this honour He gives the following curious and particular account of the ceremony et voulut veoir le Roy mon livre que je luy avoye apporte Si le vit en sa chambre car tout pourveu je l'avoye et luy mis sur son lict Er lors il l'ouvrit et regarda dedans et luy pleut tres grandement Et plaire bien luy devoit car il estoit enlumine escrit et Historie couvert de vermeil veloux a dix cloux d'argent dorez d'or et roses d'or ou meillieu a deux gros fermaulx dorez et richement ouvrez ou meillieu rosiers d'or Adonc me demanda le Roy de quoy il traictoit et je luy dis d'amours De ceste responce fut tout resjouy et regarda dedans le livre en plusieurs lieux et y lysit car moult bien parloit et lysoit Françoys et puis le fist prendre par ung sien Chevalier qui se nomme Messire Richard Credon et porter en sa chambre de retrait dont il me fist bonne chere  After passing three month in this court Froissart took his leave of the munificent but illfated Richard In the last chapter of his History where he mentions the unfortunate end of this Monarch he speaks with an honest and affecting gratitude of the liberal present he received from him on his departure from EnglandIt was a goblet of silver gilt weighing two marks and filled with a hundred nobles  On leaving England he retired to his own country and is supposed to have ended his days at his benefice of Chimay but the year of his death is uncertainThere is an antient tradition in the country says Mr de Saint Palaye that he was buried in the chapel of St Anne belonging to his own churchThat ingenious antiquarian produces an extract from its archives in which the death of Froissart is recorded but without naming the year in the most honourable termsHis obit bears the date of October and is followed by Latin verses from which I select such as appear to me the most worth transcribing  Gallorum sublimis honos fama tuorum  Hic Froissarde jaces si modo sorte jaces  Historie vivus studuisti reddere vitam  Defuncto vitam reddet at illa tibi  Proxima dum propriis florebit Francia scriptis  A forest and a river near Chimay  Famia dum ramos  A forest and a river near Chimay  Blancaque fundet aquas  Urbis ut hujus honos templi sic fama vigebis  Teque ducem Historie Gallia tota colet  Belgica tota colet Cymeaque vallis amabit  Dum rapidus proprios Scaldis obibit agros  As I have never met with any satisfactory account of Froissart's life in our language I have been tempted to swell this Note to an inordinate length yet it seems to me still necessary to add a few lines more concerning the character both of the Historian and the PoetA long series of French Critics to whom even the judicious Bayle has been tempted to give credit have severely censured Froissart as the venal partizan of the English and they have accused his last Editor Sauvage of mutilating his author because they could find in his edition on proofs of their chargeThe amiable St Palaye has defended le bon Froissart as he is called by honest Montaigne  from this unjust accusation and done full justice at the same time to the injured reputation of his exact and laborious editor  It may serve as a kind of memento mori to poetical vanity to reflect that Froissart is hardly known as a Poet though his fertile pen produced verses which were once the delight of Princes and the favourite study of the gallant and the fairHow far he deserved the oblivion into which his poetical compositions have fallen the reader may conceive from the following judgment of his French Critic with whose ingenious reflection on the imperfections attending the early state both of Poetry and Painting I shall terminate this Note  On peut dire en général au sujet des Poesies de Froissart que l'invention pour les sujets lui manquoit antant que l'imagination pour les ornemens du reste le style qu'il employe moins abondant que diffus offre souvent la répétition ennuyeuse des mêmes tours des mêmes phrases pour rendre des idées assez

into Day  Nicholas Machiavel the celebrated Florentine was first patronized by Leo who caused one of his comedies to be acted with great magnificence at Rome and engaged him to write a private Treatise de Reformatione Reipublicae Florentinae His famous political Essay entitled "The Prince" was published in and dedicated to the Nephew of that Pontiff The various judgments that have been passed on this singular performance are a striking proof of the incertitude of human opinionIn England it has received applause from the great names of Bacon and Clarendon who suppose it intended to promote the interest of liberty and virtue In Italy after many years of approbation it was publicly condemned by Clement the VIIIth at the instigation of a Jesuit who had not read the book In France it has even been supposed instrumental to the horrid  massacre of St Bartholomew as the favourite study of Catherine of Medicis and her Sons and as teaching the bloody lessons of extirpation which they so fatally put in practice Yet one of his French Translators has gone so far as to say that "Machiavel who passes among all the world for a teacher of Tyranny detested it more than any man of the age in which he lived" It must however be owned that there is a great mixture of good and evil in his political precepts For the latter many plausible apologies have been made and it should be remembered to his honour that his great aim was to promote the welfare of his country in exciting the House of Medicis to deliver Italy from the invasion of foreigners  He is said to have been made Historiographer of Florence as a reward for having suffered the torture on suspicion of conspiring against the government of that city having supported the severe trial with unfailing resolution His History of that republic he wrote at the request of Clement the VIIth as we are informed in his Dedication of it to that Pontiff The style of this work is much celebrated and the first Book may be

ecclesiastical forces and being Governor of Romagna and lastly of Bologna in which city he is said to have received the most flattering compliments from the Emperor Charles VHaving gained much reputation both civil and military in various scenes of active life he passed his latter days in retirement at his villa near Florence where he died soon after completing his History in the th year of his age Notwithstanding the high reputation of Guicciardin his History has been violently attacked both as to matter and styleThe honest Montaigne inveighs with great warmth against the malignant turn of its author and his own countryman Boccalini in whose whimsical but lively work there are many excellent remarks on History and Historians supposes a Lacedaemonian thrown into agonies by a single

young Historian born at an antient castle in the territories of Padua though generally called a native of Cyprus The little Davila was brought early into France at the age of he signalized himself in the military scenes of that country His last exploit there was at the siege of Amiens where he fought under Henry IV and received a wound in the knee as he relates himself in his HistoryAfter peace was established in France he withdrew into Italy and served the Republic of Venice with great reputation till a most unfortunate adventure put an end to his life in Passing through Verona with his wife and family on his way to Crema which he was appointed to defend and demanding according to the usual custom of persons in his station a supply of horses and carriages for his retinue a brutal Veronese called il Turco entered the room where he and his family were at supper and being mildly reprimanded for his intrusion by Davila discharged a pistol at the Historian and shot him dead on the instantHis accomplices also killed the Chaplain of Davila and wounded many of his attendants But his eldest son Antonio a noble youth of eighteen revenged the death of his father by killing his murderer on the spot All the confederates were secured the next morning and publicly executed at VeronaMemoire Istoriche prefixed to the London edition of Davila to It is very remarkable that Davila passes no censure on the Massacre of St BartholomewHis character of the Queen Mother has that partiality which it was natural for him to shew to the Patroness of his family but his general veracity is confirmed by the great authority of the first Duke of Epernon who to use the words of Lord Bolingbroke "had been an actor and a principal actor too in many of the scenes that Davila recites"  Girard Secretary to this Duke and no contemptible Biographer relates that this History came down to the place where the old man resided in Gascony a little before his death that he read it to him that the

merchant of Venice and born in that city He took the religious habit in the monastery of the Servites After receiving priest's orders in he passed four years in Mantua being appointed to read Lectures on Divinity and Canon Law by the Bishop of that diocese and in this early part of his life he is conjectured to have conceived the first idea of writing his celebrated History as he formed an intimate friendship during his residence in Mantua with Camillo d'Oliva who had been Secretary to Cardinal Gonzaga at the Council of Trent and excited the learned Venetian to the arduous task which he so happily accomplished in a future period He was recalled from Mantua to read Lectures on Philosophy in his own convent at Venice which he did with great reputation during the years and He went to Rome as Procurator General in Passing from thence to Naples he there formed an acquaintance with the famous Baptista Porta who has left this honourable testimony of his universal knowledge Eo doctiorem subtiliorem quotquot adhuc videre contigerit neminem cognovimus natum ad Encyclopediam c Nor is this an exaggerated compliment as there is hardly any science which escaped his active mind His discoveries in Optics and Anatomy would be alone sufficient to immortalize his name had he not  gained immortality by a still nobler exertion of his mental powers in defending the liberties of his country against the tyranny of Rome On the first attack of Pope Paul V on two laws of Venice very wisely framed to correct the abuses of the clergy Father Paul arose as the literary champion of the Republic and defended its cause with great spirit and temper in various compositions though he is said not to be Author of the Treatise generally ascribed to him on the occasion and entitled  The Rights of Sovereigns  cHis chief performance on the subject was  Considerazioni sopra le Censure di Paolo V  The Venetians shewed a just admiration of the sublime virtue of a Monk who defended so nobly the civil rights of his country against the separate interest of the church In the Council passed a decree in his favour which I shall transcribe in this note because it is not found in the common Lives of Father Paul and because there is hardly any object more pleasing to the mind than the contemplation of a free state rewarding one of its most virtuous servants with liberality and

adjusted her disputes with Rome by the mediation of France the first attack was made on the life of Father Paul He was beset near his convent in the evening by five assassins who stabbed him in many places and left him for dead He recovered under the care of the celebrated Acquapendente appointed to attend him at the public charge to whom as he was speaking on the depth of the principal wound his patient said pleasantly that the world imputed it stylo Romanae Curiae The crime is generally supposed to have proceeded from the Jesuits but the secret authors of it were never clearly discovered though the five ruffians were traced by the Venetian Ambassador in Rome where they are said to have been well received at first but failing afterwards in their expected reward to have perished in misery and want The Senate of Venice paid such attention to Father Paul as expressed the highest sense of his merit and the most affectionate solicitude for his safety They not only doubled his stipend a second time but entreated him to chuse a public residence for the greater security of his person The munificence and care of the Republic was equalled by the modesty and fortitude of their servant He chose not to relinquish his cell and though warned of various machinations against his life he continued to serve his country with unabating zeal discovering in his private letters to  his friends the most heroic calmness of mind and saying in answer to their admonitions that "no man lives well who is too anxious for the preservation of life"Yet the apprehensions of his friends had too just a foundation In another conspiracy was formed to murder him in his sleep by some persons of his own conventbut their treachery was happily discoveredFrom this time he lived in more cautious retirement still devoting himself to the service of the Republic on various occasions and acquiring new reputation by many compositions At the length the world was surprized by his History of the Council of Trent first published at London with the fictitious name of Pietro Soave Polano and dedicated to James the Ist by Antonio de Dominis the celebrated Archbishop of Spalatto who speaks of the concealed Author as his intimate friend who had entrusted him with a manuscript on which his modesty set a trifling value but which it seemed proper to bestow upon the world even without his consentThe mystery concerning the publication of this noble work has never been thoroughly cleared up and various falsities concerning it have been reported by author of considerable reputationIt has even been said that James the Ist had some share in the composition of the bookif he had it was probably in forming the name Pietro Soave Polano which is an anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneziano and the only part of the book which bears any relation to the style or taste of that MonarchFather Paul was soon supposed to be the real Author of the work in question The Prince of Condé on a visit to his cloyster expressly asked him if he was soto which he modestly replied that at Rome it was well known who had written itHe enjoyed not many years the reputation arising from this masterly productionin a fever occasioned his death which was even more exemplary and sublime than his life itself He prepared himself for approaching dissolution with the most devout composure and as the liberty of his country was the darling object of his exalted mind he prayed for its preservation  with his last breath in the two celebrated words Esto Perpetua  There is a singular beauty in the character of Father Paul which is not only uncommon in his profession but is rarely found in human natureThough he passed a long life in controversy of the most exasperating kind and was continually attacked in every manner that malignity could suggest both his writings and his heart appeared perfectly free from a vindictive spiritdevoting all the powers of his mind to the defence of the public cause he seemed entirely to forget the injuries that were perpetually offered to his own person and reputation  His constitution was extremely delicate and his intense application exposed him to very frequent and violent disorders these he greatly remedied by his singular temperance living chiefly on bread fruits and waterThis imperfect account of a character deserving the noblest elogium is principally extracted from an octavo volume entitled Memoire Anedote spettanti a F Paolo da Francesco Griselini Veneziano c edit d The author of this elaborate work has pointed out several mistakes in the French and English accounts of Father Paul particularly in the anecdotes related of him by Burnet in his Life of Bishop Bedell and by Mr Brent the son of his English TranslatorSome of these had indeed been observed before by Writers of our ownSee the General Dictionary under the article Father PaulFor the length and for the deficiencies of this Note I am tempted to apologize with a sentence borrowed from the great Historian who is the subject of itChi mi osserverà in alcuni tempi abondare in altri andar ristretto si ricordi che non tutti i campi sono di ugnal fertilità ne tutti li grani meritano d'esser conservati e di quelli che il mietitore vorrebbe tenerne conto qualche spica aneo sfugge la presa della mano o il filo della falce cosi comportando la conditione d'ogni mietitura che resti anco parte per rispigolare  NOTE XIII VERSE  The clear Osorius in his classic phrase  Jerom Osorius was born of a noble family at Lisbon He was educated at the university of Salamanca and afterwards studied at Paris and Bologna On his return to Portugal he gradually rose to the Bishopric of Sylves to which he was appointed by Catherine of Austria Regent of the kingdom in the minority of Sebastian At the request of Cardinal Henry of Portugal he wrote his History of King Emanuel and the expedition of Gamawhich his great contemporary Camoens made at the same time the subject of his immortal Lusiad a poem which has at length appeared with due lustre in our language being translated with great spirit and elegance by Mr Mickle It is remarkable that the History of Osorius and the Epic Poem of Camoens were published in the same year but the fate of these two great Authors was very different the Poet was suffered to perish in poverty under the reign of that Henry who patronized the Historian yet allowing for the difference of their professions I am inclined to think they possessed a similarity of mind There appear many traces of that high heroic spirit even in the Priest Osorius which animated the Soldier Camoens particularly in the pleasure with which he seems to describe the martial manners of his countrymen under the reign of EmanuelIllius aetate says the Historian in the close of his manly work inopia in exilium pulsa videbatur maestitiae locus non erat querimoniae silebant omnia choreis cantibus personabant ejusmodi ludis aula regia frequenter oblectabatur Nobiles adolescentes cum virginibus regiis in aulâ sine ulla libidinis significatione saltabant et quamvis honestissimis amoribus indulgerent virginibus erat insitum neminem ad familiaritatem admittere nisi illum qui aliquid fortiter animose bellicis in rebus effecisset Pueris enim nobilibus qui in aula regia versabantur non erat licitum pallium virile sumere  antequam in Africam trajicerent aliquod inde decus egregium reportarent Et his quidem moribus erat illius temporis nobilitas instituta ut multi ex illius domo viri omni laude cumulati prodirentThis is a striking picture of the manners of chivalry to which Portugal owed much of its glory in that splendid period There is one particular in the character of Osorius which considering his age and country deserves the highest encomium I mean his tolerating spirit In the first book of his History he speaks of Emanuel's cruel persecution of the Jews in the following generous and exalted languageFuit quidem hoc nec ex lege nec ex religione factum Quid enim Tu rebelles animos nullaque ad id suscepta religione constrictos adigas ad credendum ea quae summa contentione aspernantur respuunt Idque tibi assumas ut libertatem voluntatis impedias vincula mentibus effraenatis injicias at id neque fiori potest neque Christi sanctissimum numen approbat Voluntarium enim sacrificium non vi et malo coactum ab hominibus expetit neque vim mentibus inferri sed voluntates ad studium verae religionis allici invitari jubet Postremo quis non videt et ita religionem per religionis simulationem undignissime violariOsorius is said to have used many arguments to dissuade Sebastian from his unfortunate expedition into Africa and to have felt so deeply the miseries which befell the Portugueze after that fatal event that his grief was supposed to accelerate his death He expired in happy says De Thou who celebrates him as a model of Christian virtue that he died just before the Spanish army entered Portugal and thus escaped being a witness to the desolation of his countryHis various works were published at Rome in by his nephew Osorius in four volumes folio with a Life of their Author Among these are two remarkable productions the first an admonition to our Queen Elizabeth exhorting her to return into the Church of Rome the second an Essay on Glory written with such classical purity as to give  birth to a report that it was not the composition of Osorius but the lost work of Cicero on that subject  NOTE XIV VERSE  Iberia's Genius bids just Fame allow  An equal wreath to Mariana's brow  John Mariana was born at Talavera a town in the diocese of Toledo as he himself informs us in his famous Essay  de Rege  which opens with a beautiful romantic description of a sequestered spot in that neighbourhood where he enjoyed the pleasures of literary retirement with his friend Calderon a Minister of Toledo whose death he mentions in the same Essay commemorating his learning and his virtues in the most pleasing terms of affectionate admirationMariana was admitted into the order of Jesuits at the age of He travelled afterwards into Italy and France and returning into Spain in settled at Toledo and died there in the th year of his age Hearing it frequently regretted in the course of his travels that there was no General History of his country he engaged in that great work on his return and published it in Latin at Toledo with a dedication to Philip the IId where he speaks of his own performance with modesty and manly freedom and perhaps with as little flattery as ever appeared in any address of that nature to a Monarch continually fed with the grossest adulation This elaborate work he translated into Spanish but as he himself declares with all the freedom of an original author He published his Version in with an address to Philip the IIId in which he laments the decline of Learning in his country and declares he had himself executed that work from his apprehension of its being mangled by an ignorant Translator He had closed his History which begins with the first peopling of Spain with the death of Ferdinand in but in a subsequent edition in  he added to it a short summary of events to the year but in the year before he first published the Spanish Version of his History he addressed also to the young Monarch Philip the IIId his famous Essay which I have mentioned and which was publicly burnt at Paris about years after its publication on the supposition that it had excited Ravaillac to the murder of Henry the IVth though it was asserted with great probability by the Jesuits that the Assassin had never seen the bookIt is true indeed that Mariana in this Essay occasionally defends Clement the Monk who stabbed Henry the IIId and it is very remarkable that he grounds this defence not on the bigotted tenets of a Priest who thinks every thing lawful for the interest of his church but on those sublime principles of civil liberty with which an antient Roman would have vindicated the dagger of Brutus Indeed this Essay contains some passages on Government which would not have dishonoured even Cicero himself but it must be owned they are grievously disgraced by the last chapter of the Work which breathes a furious spirit of ecclesiastical intolerance and yet closes with these mild and modest expressions Nostrum de regno et Regis institutione judicium fortasse non omnibus placeat qui volet sequatur aut suo potius stet si potioribus argumentis nitatur de quibus rebus tantopere asseveravi in his libris eas nunquam veriores quam alienam sententiam affirmabo Potest enim non solum mihi aliud aliud aliis videri sed et mihi ipsi alio tempore Suam quisque sententiam per me sequatur et qui nostra leget memor conditionis humanae si quid erratum est pio studio rempublicam juvandi veniam benignus concedat et facilisThis is not the only work of Mariana which fell under a public proscription he was himself persecuted and suffered a year's imprisonment for a treatise which seems to have been dictated by the purest love to his country it was against the pernicious practice of debasing the public coin and as it was supposed to reflect on the Duke of Lerma called the Sejanus of Spain it exposed the Author about the  year to the persecution of that vindictive Minister from which it does not appear how he escapedIndeed the accounts of Mariana's life are very imperfect Bayle whom I have chiefly followed mentions a life of him by De Vargas which he could not procure I have sought after this Biographer with the same ill success as I wished to give a more perfect account of this great Author whose personal History is little known among us though it is far from being unworthy of attention  NOTE XV VERSE  The liberal spirit of Thuanus rose  James Augustus De Thou was the youngest son of Christopher De Thou First President of the Parliament of Paris and born in that city His own Memoirs give a pleasing account of the early activity of his mind As his health during his childhood was so tender and infirm that his parents rather restrained him from the usual studies of his age he devoted much of his time to drawing and copied with a pen the engravings of Albert Durer before he was ten years old At that age he was settled in the college of Burgundy but this plan of his education was soon interrupted by a fever in which his life was despaired of and in which the mother of his future friend the Duke of Montpensier watched him with an attention singularly happy after his physicians and his parents had considered him as dead In a few years after his recovery he repaired to Orleans to study the civil law from thence he was drawn to Valence in Dauphiny by the reputation of Cujacius who was then reading lectures there on his road he embraced an opportunity of hearing Hotoman the celebrated author of FrancoGallia who was reading lectures also at BourgesDuring his residence at Valence he contracted a friendship with Joseph Scaliger which he cultivated through lifeIn his father recalled him to Paris just before the massacre of St BartholomewHe mentions in his Memoirs  the horrors which he felt in seeing a very small part of that bloody sceneHe resided in the house of his uncle Nicholas De Thou promoted to the bishopric of Chartres he was then designed himself for the church and beginning to collect his celebrated library applied himself particularly to the Civil Law and to Grecian literature  He travelled into Italy in with Paul De Foix going on an embassy to the Pope and the Italian Princes Of De Foix he gives the most engaging character and speaks with great pleasure of the literary entertainment and advantages which he derived from this expeditionHe returned to Paris and devoted himself again to his studies in the following yearOn the dissentions in the Court of France in he was employed to negotiate with the Mareschal Montmorency and engage him to interpose his good offices to prevent the civil war which he for some time effectedThe same year he visited the Low Countries and on his return was appointed to a public office on which he entered with that extreme diffidence which is so natural to a delicate mind  In he travelled again with his elder brother who was sent by his physicians to the baths of Plombieres in Lorrain from hence he made a short excursion into Germany and was received there with the jovial hospitality of that country which he describes in a very lively mannerBut affection soon recalled him to Plombieres to attend his infirm brother to Paris who died there in a few months after their return  In on the plague's appearing in the capital our Historian retired into Touraine and after visiting the principal places in Normandy returned to Paris in the winterIn the following year he was of the number chosen from the Parliament of Paris to administer justice in Guienne as two ecclesiastics were included in that commissionIn this expedition he embraced every opportunity of preparing the materials of his History seeking as he ever did the society of all persons eminent for their talents o  capable of giving him any useful information He speaks with great pleasure of a visit which be paid of this time to the celebrated Montaigne whom he calls a man of a most liberal mind and totally uninfected with the spirit of partyAfter various excursions he was now returning to Paris when he received the unexpected news of his father's death an event which affected him most deeply as filial affection was one of the striking characteristics of his amiable mindHe consoled himself under the affliction of having been unable to pay his duty to his dying parent by erecting a magnificent monument to his memory expressive of the high veneration in which he ever held his virtuesHe engaged again in public business devoting his intervals of leisure to mathematical studies and to the composition of Latin verse which seems to have been his favourite amusement In he published his Poem de re Accipitraria which though much celebrated by the critics of his age has fallen like the subject of which it treats into universal neglectIn he bid adieu to the Court on finding himself treated with such a degree of coldness as his ingenuous nature could not submit to and being eager to advance in his great work which he had already brought down to the reign of Francis II In having been often pressed to marry by his family and being absolved from his ecclesiastical engagements for that purpose he made choice of Marie Barbanson of an antient and noble family but as her parents were suspected of a secret inclination to the reformed religion it was thought proper that the lady should undergo a kind of expiation in a private conference with two Catholic Divines a circumstance of which the great Historian speaks with an air of triumph in his Memoirs as a proof of his own inviolable attachment to the faith of his fathers In he lost his affectionate mother who is described by her son as meeting death with the same gentleness and tranquillity of mind by which her life was distinguished When the violence of the league had reduced Henry the IIId to abandon Paris our Historian was sent  into Normandy to confirm the magistrates of that province in their adherence to the KingHe afterwards met Henry at Blois and while he was receiving from him in private some commissions to execute at Paris the King pressed his hand and seemed preparing to impart to him some important secret but after a long pause dismissed him without revealing itThis secret was afterwards supposed to have been the projected assassination of the Duke of Guise the supposition is probable and it is also probable that if Henry had then revealed his design the manly virtue and eloquence of De Thou might have led him to relinquish that infamous and fatal measureHe was however so far from suspecting the intended crime of the King that when he first heard at Paris that Guise was assassinated he believed it a false rumour only spread by that faction to introduce what he supposed had really happened the murder of the KingIn the commotions which the death of Guise produced in Paris many insults were offered to the family of De Thou his wife was imprisoned for a day in the Bastile but obtaining her liberty she escaped from the city in a mean habit attended by her husband disguised also in the dress of a soldier Having sent his wife in safety into Picardy he repaired to the King who was almost deserted at Blois and was greatly instrumental in persuading his master to his coalition with Henry of Navarre The King determined to establish a Parliament at Tours and De Thou was considered as the most proper person to be the President of this assembly but with his usual modesty he declined this honour and chose rather to engage with his friend Mr de Schomberg in an expedition to Germany for the service of the King He was at first designed for the embassy to Elizabeth but at the request of Schomberg declined the appointment and accompanied his friend  He first received intelligence of the King's death at Venice where he had formed an intimacy with the celebrated Arnauld d'Ossat at that time Secretary to the Cardinal JoyeuseIn consequence  of their conversation on this event and the calamities of France De Thou addressed a Latin Poem to his friend which he afterwards printed at Tours  In leaving Italy he passed a few days at Padua with his friend Vicenzio Pinelli from whom he collected many particulars concerning the most eminent Italian and Spanish Authors whom he determined to celebrate in his History in the hope as he honestly confesses that his liberal attention to foreign merit might entitle his own Works to the favour both of Italy and Spain but he was disappointed in this fair expectation and laments the ingratitude which he experienced from both  On his return to France he was graciously received by Henry the IVth and in giving that Prince an account of Italy suggested to him the idea of a connexion with Mary of Medicis After the battle of Ivry he complimented the King in a short Poem which closes with the following lines  Auspiciis vulgo peraguntur praelia regum  Perque duces illis gloria multa venit  Tu vincis virtute tua nec militis haec est  Ista tibi propria laurea parta manu  As he was travelling soon afterwards with his wife and family which he designed to settle at Tours his party was intercepted by the enemy and he was obliged to abandon his wife and her attendants being prevailed on by their intreaties to secure his own escape by the swiftness of his horseHe repaired to the King at Gisors and soon obtained the restitution of his familyOn the death of Amyot Bishop of Auxerre well known by his various Translations from the Greek language the King appointed De Thou his Principal Librarian In our Historian was very near failing a victim to the plague but happily struggled through that dangerous distemper by the assistance of two skilful physicians who  attended him at ToursIn he began the most important part of his History and under this year he introduces in his Memoirs a long and spirited Poem addressed to Posterity in which he enters into a justification of himself against the malignant attacks which the manly and virtuous freedom of his writings had drawn upon him It concludes with the following animated appeal to the spirit of his father  Vos O majorum Cineres teque optime longis  Soliciti genitor defuncte laboribus aevi  Testor pro patria nullas regnique salute  Vitavisse vices vestra virtute meaque  Indignum nil fecisse et si fata tulissent  Prodessem ut patriae patriae succurrere livor  Absistat pietate mea meruisse petenti  Pura ad vos anima atque hodiernae nescia culpae  Descendam quandoque novissima venerit hora  Nostraque sub tacitos ibit fama integra manes  In he succeeded his uncle Augustin as President a MortierIn he lost his valuable and learned friend Pithou who first solicited him to undertake his History and had greatly assisted him in the prosecution of that laborious workHow deeply the affectionate mind of De Thou was wounded by this event appears from his long letter to Casaubon on the occasionIn he began to be engaged in those negotiations which happily terminated in the famous edict of NantesIt may be proper to observe here that De Thou was accused of being a Calvinist in consequence of the part he acted in this business as well as from the moderate tenor of his History and it is remarkable that Sully seems in his Memoirs to countenance the accusation  In our Historian suffered a severe domestic affliction in the loss of his wifeHe celebrated her virtues and his own connubial  affection in a Latin Poem with this and a Greek epitaph on the same lady written by Casaubon he terminates the Commentary of his own Life of which the preceding account is an imperfect abridgmentHis first wife leaving him no children he married in Gasparde de la Chastre an accomplished lady of a noble family who having brought him three sons and three daughters died at the age of There is a fine letter of Daniel Heinsius addressed to our author on this occasion exhorting him to fortitude but this unexpected domestic calamity and the miseries which befel his country on the murder of Henry the Great are said to have wounded his feeling mind so deeply as to occasion his death which happened in May Under the regency of Mary of Medicis he had been one of the Directors general of the finances maintaining the same reputation for integrity in that department which he had ever preserved in his judicial capacity  The first part of his History appeared in with a Preface addressed to Henry IV justly celebrated for its liberal and manly spiritBut I must observe that the following compliment to the KingQuicquid de ea statueris jusserisve pro divinae vocis oraculo mihi eritwas more than even that most amiable of Monarchs deserved as he ungratefully deserted the cause of our Historian in suffering his work to be proscribed by the public censure of Rome in as De Thou plainly intimates in the following passage from one of his letters written Publicata prima parte Historiae meae immane quam commoti sunt plerique sive invidi sive factiosi qui mox proceres quosdam qui per se in talibus rebus nihil vident per calumnias artificiose confictas ut scis in me concitaverunt remque e vestigio Romam detulerunt et auctore maligne exagitato facile pervicerunt ut morosi illi censores omnia mea sinistre▪ interpretarentur et praejudicio personae opus integrum cujus ne tertiam quidem partem legerant praecipitato ordine damnarent Rex causam meam initio quidem tuebatur quamdiu  proceres in aula infestos habui Sed paulatim ipse eorundem astu infractus est cognitoque Romae per emissarios labare regem post Ossati et Serafini Cardinalium mihi amicissimorum obitum et illustrissimi Perronii ex urbe discessum ictus postremo in me directus est qui facile vitari potuit si qui circa regem erant tantae injuriae sensum ad se ac regni dignitatem pertinere vel minima significatione prae se tulissent Ita in aula omni ope destitutus facile Romae oppressus sumDe Thou was preparing a new edition of his History at the time of his deathHis passion for Latin verse appears never to have forsaken him as the latest effusion of his pen was a little poem descriptive of his last illness and an epitaph in which he draws the following just character of himself  Mihi veritatis cura vitae commodis  Antiquiorque charitatibus fuit  Nullique facto voce nulli injurius  Injurias patienter aliorum tuli  Tu quisquis es qualisque quantusque O bone  Si cura veri est ulla si pietas movet  A me meisque injuriam quaeso abstine  The pious paternal prayer in the last line was very far from being crowned with success Francis the eldest son of De Thou fell a victim to the resentment which Cardinal Richelieu is said to have conceived against him from a passage in the great Historian reflecting on the Richelieu familyHe was beheaded at Lyons for having been privy to a conspiracy against the Cardinal Voltaire with his usual philanthropy and spirit inveighs against the iniquity of this execution in his Melanges tom iiiThe curious reader may find a particular account of this tragical event in the last volume of that noble edition of Thuanus which was published under the auspices of Dr Mead and does great honour to  our countryI shall close this Note by transcribing from it the following spirited epitaph on the unfortunate victim  Historiam quisquis vult scribere scribere veram  Nunc vetat Exitium magne Thuane tuum  Richeliae stirpis proavos laefisse Paterni  Crimen erat calami quo tibi vita perit  Sanguine delentur nati monumenta parentis  Quae nomen dederant scripta dedere necem  Tanti morte viri sic est sancita Tyrannis  Vera loqui si vis disce cruenta pati  NOTE XVI VERSE  Thy Wits O France as ev'n thy Critics own  Support not History's majestic tone  To avoid every appearance of national prejudice I shall quote on this occasion some passages from a very liberal French Critic who has passed the same judgment on the Historians of his country The Marquis d'Argenson in a memoir read before the French Academy not only confesses that the French Writers have failed in History but even ventures to explain the cause of their ill success  Nous avons says he quelques morceaux ou l'on trouve tout à la fois la fidelité le gout et le vrai ton de l'Histoire mais outre qu'ils sont en petit nombre et trescourts les auteurs à qui nous en sommes redevables se sont defié de leurs forces ils ont craint de manquer d'haleine dans des ouvrages de plus longue étendue  Pourquoi les anciens ontils eu des Thucydides des Xenophons des Polybes des Tacites pourquoi ne pouvons nous leur comparer que des St Réals des Vertots des Sarrasins nous ne devons point attribuer cette disette à la decadence de l'Esprit humain Il  faut en chercher si j'ose m'exprimer ainsi quelque raison nationale quelque cause qui soit particuliere aux François  Quarre qualités principales sont nécessaires aux Historiens  Une critique exacte savante fondée sur des recherches laborieuses pour la collection des faits  Une grande profendeur en morale en politique  Une imagination sage fleurie qui peigne les actions qui deduise les causes qui presente les reflexions avec clarté simplicité quelquefois avec feu mais toujours avec gout élégance  Il faut de plus la constance dans le travail un style égal soutenu une exactitude infatigable qui ne montre jamais l'impatience d'avancer ni de lassitude pendant le cours d'une longue carrière  Qu'on separe ces qualités on trouvera des chefsd'oeuvres parmi nous des Critiques des Moralistes des Politiques des Peintres des literateurs laborieux dont le produit nous surprend Mais qu'on cherche ces qualités rassemblées on manquera d'exemples à citer entre nos AuteursThe critic then takes a rapid review of the French Historians and proceeds to make the following lively remarks on the difficulty of writing History in France and the volatile character of his countrymenJ'ai dejà prévenu l'une des plus grandes difficultés pour les auteurs ils devroient etre en meme tems hommes de cabinet hommes du monde Par l'etude on ne connoit que les anciens les moeurs bourgeoises dans la bonne compagnie on perd son tems l'on ecrit peu et l'on pense encore moins  L'haleine manque à un écrivain François faute de constance il entrepend légèrement de grands ouvrages il les continue avec nonchalance il les finit avec dégôut s'il les abandonne quelque tems il ne les reprend plus nous voyons que tous nos continuateurs ont échoué La lassitude du soir se ressent de l'ardeur  du matin C'est delà qu'il nous arrive de n'avoir de bon que de petits morecaux soit en poesie soit en prose nous n'avons que des morceaux Historiques presque pas une Histoire générale digne de louange  Choix des Memoires de l'Academie c Londres tom iii p  END OF THE NOTES TO THE SECOND EPISTLE  NOTES TO THE THIRD EPISTLE  NOTE I VERSE  AND shake th' affrighted world with dire portents  There is ae curious treatise of Dr Warburton's on this subject which is become very scarce it is entitled  A critical and philosophical Enquiry into the causes of prodigies and miracles as related by Historians with an Essay towards restoring a method and purity in History  It contains like most of the compositions of this dogmatical Writer a strange mixture of judicious criticism and entertaining absurdity in a style so extraordinary that I think the following specimens of it may amuse a reader who has not happened to meet with this singular bookHaving celebrated Rawleigh and Hyde as writers of true historic genius he adds "almost all the rest of our Histories want Life Soul Shape and Body a mere hodgepodge of abortive embryos and rotten carcases kept in an unnatural ferment which the vulgar mistake for real life by the rank leven of prodigies and portents Which can't but afford good  diversion to the Critic while he observes how naturally one of their own fables is here mythologiz'd and explain'd  of a churchyard carcase raised and set a strutting by the inflation of some hellish succubus within"  He then passes a heavy censure on the antiquarian publications of Thomas Hearne in the close of which he exclaims"Wonder not reader at the view of these extravagancies The Historic Muse after much vain longing for a vigorous adorer is now fallen under that indisposition of her sex so well known by a depraved appetite for trash and cinders"Having quoted two passages from this singular Critic in which his metaphorical language is exceedingly gross candour obliges me to transcribe another which is no less remarkable for elegance and beauty of expression In describing Sallust at one time the loud advocate of public spirit and afterwards sharing in he robberies of Caesar he expresses this variation of character by the following imagery "No sooner did the warm aspect of good fortune shine out again but all those exalted ideas of virtue and honour raised like a beautiful kind of frostwork in the cold season of adversity dissolved and disappeared  Enquiry c London page  NOTE II VERSE  On Francio now the Gallic page is mute  And British Story drops the name of Brute  The origin of the French nation was ascribed by one of the Monkish Historians to Francio a son of Priam Mr Warton who mentions this circumstance in his Dissertation on the origin of romantic fiction in Europe supposes that the revival of Virgil's Aeneid about the sixth or seventh century inspired many nations with this chimerical ides of tracing their descent from the family of Priam There is a very remarkable proof in the Historian Matthew of Westminster how fond the English were of considering themselves as the descendants  of the Trojan Brutus In a letter from Edward the First to Pope Boniface concerning the affairs of Scotland the King boasts of his Trojan predecessor in the following termsSub temporibus itaque Ely Samuelis prophetarum vir quidam strenuus et insignis Brutus nomie de genere Trojanorum post excidium urbis Trojanae cum multis nobilibus Trojanorum applicuit in quandam Insulam tunc Albion vocatam a gigantibus inhabitatam quibus sua et suorum seductis potentia et occìsis eam nomine suo Britanniam sociosque suos Britannos appellavit aedificavit civitatem quam Trinovantum nuncupavit quae modo Londinum nuncupatur  MATT WESTMON p  NOTE III VERSE  And Bacon's self for mental glory born  Meets as her slave our pity or our scorn  I wish not to dwell invidiously on the failings of this immortal Genius but it may be useful to remark that no Historical work though executed by a man of the highest mental abilities can obtain a lasting reputation if it be planned and written with a servility of spiritThis was evidently the case in Bacon's History of Henry the VIIth it was the first work he engaged in after his disgrace and laid as a peaceoffering at the feet of his master the despicable James who affected to consider his great grandfather the abject and avaricious Henry as the model of a King It was therefore the aim of the unfortunate Historian to flatter this phantasy of the royal pedant for whom he wrote and he accordingly formed a colossal statue to represent a pigmyIt is matter of astonishment that Lord Bolingbroke who in his political works has written on the vices of this very King with a force and beauty so superior to the History in question should speak of it as a work possessing merit sufficient to bear a comparison with the antients on the contrary the extreme awkwardness  of the task which the Historian imposed upon himself gave a weakness and embarrassment to his style which in his nobler works is clear nervous and manly This will particularly appear from a few lines in his character of Henry"This King to speak of him in terms equal to his deserving was one of the best sort of wonders a wonder for wise men He had parts both in his virtues and his fortune not so fit for a commonplace as for observationHis worth may bear a tale of two that may put upon him somewhat that may seem divine"He then relates a dream of Henry's mother the Lady Margaret but the quotations I have made may be sufficient to justify my remark and as Dr Johnson says happily of Milton "What Englishman can take delight in transcribing passages which if they lessen the reputation of Bacon diminish in some degree the honour of our country"  NOTE IV VERSE  And of that mountain make the statue of a King  An allusion to the Architect Dinocrates who offered to cut Mount Athos into a statue of Alexander the Great  NOTE V VERSE  As crown'd with Indian laurels nobly won c  This story is told on a similar occasion by Lucian Having asserted that historical flatterers often meet with the indignation they deserve he proceeds to this example  LUCIAN Edit Riollay p  The Critics are much divided on this passage I have followed an interpretation very different from that adopted by a learned and judicious author who has lately entered into a thorough discussion of all the anecdotes relating to this celebrated Conqueror in a very elaborate and spirited dissertation entitled "Examen critique des Historiens d'Alexandre" Paris to But there is great probability in his conjecture that the name of Aristobulus has slipt into the story by some mistake and that the sycophant so justly reprimanded was Onesicritus who attended the hero of Macedon in quality of Historiographer and is censured by the judicious Strabo as the most fabulous of all the Writers who have engaged in his History For the reasons which support this conjecture see the book I have mentioned page  NOTE VI VERSE  In Dedications quietly inurn'd  They take more lying Praise than Ammon spurn'd  As History is the composition most frequently addressed to Princes modern Historians have been peculiarly tempted to this kind of adulation Indeed Dedications in general are but too commonly a disgrace to letters Perhaps a concise History of this species of writing and the fate of some remarkable Dedicators might have a good influence towards correcting that prostitution of talents which is so often observed in productions of this nature and such a work might be very amusing to the lovers of literary anecdoteThe two most unfortunate Dedications that occur to my remembrance were written by Joshua Barnes and Dr Pearce late Bishop of Rochester The first dedicated his History of Edward the IIId to James the IId and unluckily compared that Monarch to the most valiant of his  predecessors just before his timidity led him to abdicate the throne the second dedicated his edition of Tully de Oratore to Lord Macclesfield and as unluckily celebrated his patron as a model of public virtue not many years before he was impeached in parliament and fined £ for the iniquity of his conduct in the office of Chancellor  NOTE VII VERSE  Still can Herrera mourning o'er his urn  His dying pangs to blissful rapture turn  Antonio de Herrera a Spanish Historian of great reputation describes the death of Philip II in the following terms"Y fue cosa de notar que aviendo dos o tres horas antes que espirasse tenido un paraxismo tan violento que le tuvieron por acabado cubriendole el rostro con un panno abrio los ojos con gran espiritu y tomò el crucifixo de mano de Don Hernando de Toledo y con gran devocion y ternura le besò

Herrera Madrid Tom iii f  After speaking so freely on the vices of this Monarch it is but just to observe that Philip who possessed all the sedate cruelty  of the coldblooded Octavius resembled him also in one amiable quality and was so much a friend to letters that his reign may be considered as the Augustan age of Spanish literatureHis most bloody minister the merciless Alva was the Maecenas of that wonderful and voluminous Poet Lope de Vega I cannot help regretting that the two eminent Writers who have lately delineated the reigns of Charles the Vth and his Son Philip so happily in our language have entered so little into the literary History of those times  NOTE VIII VERSE  Nor hope to stain on base Detraction's scroll  A Tully's morals or a Sidney's soul  Dion Cassius the sordid advocate of despotism endeavoured to depreciate the character of Cicero by inserting in his History the most indecent Oration that ever disgraced the page of an HistorianIn the opening of his th book he introduces Q Fusius Calenus haranguing the Roman senate against the great ornament of that assembly calling Cicero a magician and accusing him of prostituting his wife and committing incest with his daughter Some late historical attempts to sink the reputation of the great Algernon Sidney are so recent that they will occur to the remembrance of almost every Reader  NOTE IX VERSE  Nor less the

As that engaging little volume is so generally known I shall not lengthen these Notes by transcribing any part of it but I thought it just to acknowledge my  obligations to an Author whose sentiments I am proud to adopt as he united the noblest affections of the heart to great elegance of mind and is justly ranked among the most amiable of moral writers  NOTE X VERSE  To speak no Falsehood and no Truth suppress  Quis nescit primam esse Historiae legem ne quid falsi dicere audeat deinde ne quid veri non audeat De Oratore Lib ii  Voltaire has made a few just remarks on the second part of this famous Historical maxim and it certainly is to be understood with some degree of limitation The sentence of the amiable Pliny so often quotedHistoria quoquo modo scripta delectatis liable I apprehend to still more objections  NOTE XI VERSE  A waste of Genius in the toil of Knolles  Richard Knolles a native of Northamptonshire educated at Oxford published in a History of the Turks An Author of our age to whom both criticism and morality have very high obligations has bestowed a liberal encomium on this neglected Historian whose character he closes with the following just observation  "Nothing could have sunk this Author in obscurity but the remoteness and barbarity of the people whose story he relates It seldom happens that all circumstances concur to happiness or fame The nation which produced this great Historian has the grief of seeing his genius employed upon a foreign and uninteresting subject and that Writer who might have secured perpetuity to his name by a History of his own country has exposed himself to the  danger of oblivion by recounting enterprizes and revolutions of which none desire to be informed"  RAMBLER Vol III N  o    NOTE XII VERSE  And read your just reward in Brady's fate  Robert Brady born in Norfolk was Professor of Physic in the University of Cambridge which he represented in ParliamentHe was Master of Caius College and Physician in ordinary to James II He published in a History of England from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the death of Richard the Second in three volumes folio and died in His character cannot be more justly or more forcibly expressed than in the words of a living Author who has lately vindicated the antient constitution of our country with great depth of learning and with all the energy of genius inspirited by freedom  "Of Dr Brady it ought to be remembered that he was the slave of a faction and that he meanly prostituted an excellent understanding and admirable quickness to vindicate tyranny and to destroy the rights of his nation"  STUART's View of Society in Europe Notes page  NOTE XIII VERSE  Like the dumb Son of Croesus in the strife  Herodotus relates that a Persian soldier in the storming of Sardis was preparing to kill Croesus whose person he did not know and who giving up all as lost neglected to defend his own life a son of the unfortunate Monarch who had been dumb from his infancy and who never  spake afterwards found utterance in that trying moment and preserved his father by exclaiming "O kill not Croesus"  NOTE XIV VERSE  Less eager to correct than to revile  This is perhaps a just description of  The polemical Divine  as a general character but there are some authors of that class to whom it can never be applied Dr Watson in particular will be ever mentioned with honour as one of the happy few who have preserved the purity of justice and good manners in a zealous defence of religion who have given elegance and spirit to controversial writing by that liberal elevation of mind which is equally removed from the meanness of flattery and the insolence of detraction  NOTE XV Verse  The noble instinct Love of lasting Fame  There is a most animated and judicious defence of this passion in Fitzosborne's LettersBut I must content myself with barely referring my Reader to that amiable Moralist as I fear I have already extended these Notes to such a length as will expose me to the severity of criticism Indeed I tremble in reviewing the size of this Comment which I cannot close without entreating my Reader to believe that its bulk has arisen from no vain ideas of the value of my own Poem but from a desire to throw collected light on a subject which appeared to me of importance and to do all the justice in my power to many valuable writers whom I wished to celebrateThose who are inclined to censure will perhaps think this apology insufficient and I foresee  that some hasty Critics will compare the length of the Poem with that of the Annotations and then laying down the book without perusing either they will apply perhaps not unhappily to the Author the following lively couplet of Dr Young  Sure next to writing the most idle thing  Is gravely to harangue on what we sing  FINIS  ERRATA  Page end of Ver the Semicolon should be a Comma  st Line of the Argument should read thus  Vanity national and private    l  after  Thucydidesthe Full Stop
