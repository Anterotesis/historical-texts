LONGITUDE  This New Method for that Discovery is with all due Submission humbly Dedicated by  The Authors  THE INTRODUCTION  BEfore we come to give an Account of this our New Method for the Discovery of the Longitude both by Sea and Land which we here take leave humbly to propose to the Consideration of the Publick we think it reasonable to premise somewhat by way of Introduction To give some Account of the Nature of the Problem before us to speak a little of the Methods hitherto try'd and the Reasons of their ill Success and to add a brief Historical Narration from what Occasions and by what Steps this  our Method was first discover'd and has arriv'd at its present Degree of Maturity  As to the Problem it self the Invention of the Longitude it is plainly this To discover in some measure a like sure way of frequently knowing how far we are distant on the Earth Spherical Surface in Degrees from any known Meridian Eastward or Westward as we can easily know almost at any time how far we are distant in Degrees on the same Surface from the middle Circle or Equator Northward or Southward Now in this Case it must be noted that as the Diurnal Motion does naturally imply fixed Poles and a fixed Equator which infer a different Meridian Altitude of those Poles and of that Equator and by consequence of all the heavenly Bodies in different Latitudes which different Altitude may in clear Weather be easily observ'd by proper  Instruments and thereby that Latitude may be readily discovered so does not the same Diurnal Motion at all imply any  Phaenomena  whence the Longitude may be discover'd to us Because the same Parallel still bears through its whole Circumference the same Relation to those Poles and that Equator without any Difference The Diurnal Motion therefore which affords an obvious Foundation for the Invention of the Latitude of every Place on the Earth affords us no such Foundation for the Invention of the Longitude of the same Places Nor is it therefore an easy Problem either astronomical or practical to discover the same  As to the Methods hitherto tryed they are either Celestial or Terrestrial and may be reduc'd to these Seven Four that are  Celestial  and Three that are  Terrestrial  The Eclipses of the Moon  The Eclipses of the Sun  The Eclipses of Jupiters Planets  The Motion of the Moon  The Variation of the Needle  Clocks or Watches  The Log Line or Dead Reckoning  First The Eclipses of the Moon are useful for the Longitude For its Immersions into the Earths Shadow its nearest Distances to that Center and its Emersions therefrom are all at distinct and known Points of absolute time So that where and when they can be nicely observ'd and the Difference of the apparent times at every Meridian noted the respective Longitudes of those Places may be thereby found in time and by allowing Degrees of the Equator to an Hour may be found in Degrees also  Secondly in the same manner may the Eclipses of the Sun be made use of especially as now improv'd by our great Astronomer Mr  Flamsteeds  Construction  of them and as they will we hope be farther improv'd by Mr  Whistons  actual  Exhibition  of them in his Instrument just ready for Publication Which Method by the Difference of the apparent time of any Part of the Eclipse in different Places gives the Difference of Meridians or of Longitude in the like manner as before  Thirdly The Eclipses of Jupiters Satellits afford another like Method for the Discovery of the Longitude and that on the same Foundation with those of the Moon  Fourthly the Motion of the Moon with its Distance from the Sun or rather its Appulse to and Occultation of those fixed Stars that ly along its Course is another remarkable Method for this purpose and is of the same Nature with the Eclipses of the Sun as to this matter  These Four may justly be called  Celestial  or  Astronomical  Methods of  discovering the Longitude because they make use of the Celestial Bodies or of the Stars in order to that End The Three  Terrestrial  Methods are as follows  ly The Variation of the Needle from the North is now especially since Dr  Halleys  noble Observations and Map thereto relating become one Method for the Discovery of the Longitude particularly in those Parts where that Variation is best known and the North and South Position of its Lines are most remarkable For by crossing the Meridians there you also cross the Curves of equal Variation and discover in some measure your Longitude thereby  Sixthly The Use of Clocks or Watches at Sea is another Method and was attempted by the famous  Hugenius  And indeed if they could be exactly kept to an even motion and so shew the Hour at any one certain place at Land the Comparison  of the Time known by that Clock or Watch with the apparent time at the Ship known by the Sun or Stars or another Clock or Watch regulated by them would discover the Longitude from the Place to which that first Clock or Watch was adjusted in time and so as before in Degrees also  Seventhly The Logline and Dead Reckning when all fails is the last Remedy in this case and from thence the Seamen guess as well as they can by the Angle and length of their Course what Longitude and Latitude they are in And when by Observation they find their Error in Latitude they conclude upon a proportionable one in Longitude also And so for want of a sure Guide either Celestial or Terrestial they are forc'd to depend on this which yet is as well as the rest very uncertain and inaccurate  For to come to the Reasons of the small Success of these several Methods  As to the two first the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon to say nothing here of the slowness of the Moon's Motion which renders any great degree of exactness impossible or of the difficulty of Calculation and Construction especially in the Sun's Eclipses and of Observations in both The single rareness of these Eclipses which is not seldom made still rarer by cloudy Weather renders them of very little use in Navigation  As to the third Method by the Eclipses of  Jupiter  's Planets this must be own'd of much greater use Since the quickness of their Motion especially as to the innermost makes the Moment of their Immersion into or Emersion from  Jupiter  's Shadow very distinct and nice and their frequency which is almost one for every Day renders them fit for the constant uses of Navigation Nor  have we hitherto had any other Method so useful at Land as this Yet are there great Difficulties belonging to this Method especially at Sea The best Tables of their Motions are hitherto too imperfect to be at all times depended on as to the exact absolute Time of their Celebration And they require Telescopes of such a length as have not hitherto been manageable at Sea in that state of Tossing and Agitation which Ships there are subject to Which difficulties added to the impossibility of seeing these Eclipses for about three Months every Year when  Jupiter  is near the Sun renders this Method at present of small use in Navigation  Nor can the fourth Method or the distance of the Moon from the Sun with its Appulse to or Occultation of those fixed Stars which lye along its course give us the Longitude to sufficient exactness For to say nothing here of the slowness of the Moon's  Motion the want of the utmost accuracy of even the place of some of these fixed Stars themselves and of the Sun it self or of the necessity of the use of smaller Telescopes even in this Case as well as of the trouble of the Calculation and Construction which are lesser Difficulties here also 'Tis plain the Theory of the Moon especially in some positions is not exact enough hitherto for our purpose as not serving for this Longitude nearer than to two or three Degrees whereas the Seamen want it within one Degree or less Tho' indeed it must be allow'd that if the Moon's Theory could be once so far perfected that its place might be with certainty calculated nearer than to two Minutes of a Degree this would be a very useful Method in order to the Discovery of the Longitude at Sea Which Improvement therefore of it's Theory is a thing highly desireable in Astronomy  We come now to the  Terrestrial  Methods and to those difficulties which render them also incapable of discovering the Longitude with that certainty and to that degree of exactness which the purposes of Navigation require Thus the Curve lines of the Variation of the Needle which is the first Terrestrial Method are of small use because the Laws of that Variation are not yet brought to a sufficient certainty notwithstanding the most useful endeavours of Dr  Halley  in that Matter The Neighbourhood of Iron Mines of Iron or of Loadstones themselves does sometimes disturb the general Rules and deceive the Observers of that Variation The Position of those Curves too far Eastward and Westward in a great part of the World renders this Variation useless as to any general Discovery of the Longitude and even there where the Position of these Curves is the most advantageous  as it is about the Cape of Good Hope and a considerable way on both sides of it yet is the distance of those Curves for the difference of one Degree of Variation about Geographical Miles  i e  near two Degrees of a great Circle and so this Method is incapable of shewing the Longitude very nicely in any Case whatsoever  Thus the second Terrestrial Method by Clocks or Watches tho' the easiest to understand and practice of all others has been so long in vain attempted at Sea that we see little Hopes of its great usefulness there Watches are so influenc'd by heat and cold moisture and drought and their small Springs Wheels and Pevets are so incapable of that degree of exactness which is here requir'd that we believe all wise Men give up their Hopes from them in this Matter Clocks govern'd by long Pendulum's go much truer But then the difference of Gravity in different Latitudes  the lengthening of the Pendulumrod by heat and shortening it by cold together with the different moisture of the Air and the tossings of the Ship all put together are circumstances so unpromising that we believe Wise Men are almost out of hope of Success from this Method also  And as for the LogLine and DeadReckoning which is the third Terrestrial Method they were the known deficiencies of this common way as alter'd by Storms and Currents and the Inaccuracies of the way it self and of even the Latitude as commonly taken together with the too frequent and enduring cloudy Weather when they can take no Latitude at all which have occasion'd the Seamen to desire some other Assistance for the Discovery before us  We now come to our last Business  viz  to give the World a short History of our own Proposal from what occasions  and by what steps this our Method was first discover'd and has arriv'd at its present degree of Maturity As to which matter the Reader is to know that somewhat above a Year ago Mr  Whiston  and Mr  Ditton  with some other common Friends spent part of an Afternoon and the Evening together Mr  Ditton  took an occasion among other common discourse to observe to Mr  Whiston  that  'The nature of Sounds would afford a method true at least in Theory for the discovery of the Longitude'  since  The difference between the apparent time where the Sound is made and where it is heard abating only the time for its diffusion which was now well known is the difference of the Longitude of those two Places in time  Mr  Whiston  immediately own'd the truth of the Proposition and added  'That as to the Propagation of Sounds he remembred to have himself plainly  heard the Explosion of great Guns about or Miles  viz  when the  French  Fleet was engag'd with Ours off  Beachyhead  in  Sussex  which was  AD  and himself was at  Cambridge  and that he had been inform'd that in one of the  Dutch  Wars the sound of the like Explosions had been heard into the very middle of  England  at a much greater distance Upon this Mr  Whiston  when they parted told Mr  Ditton  that he took the thing to be so considerable that tho it had been discoursed of in mix'd Company after an unguarded manner yet he look'd on it as fit to be conceal'd since no body could tell what Improvements might on farther Consideration be built upon such a Foundation'  Which Advice Mr  Ditton  follow'd and accordingly desir'd and obtain'd the Silence of those that had then heard  what had pass'd This Proposition about Sounds and their distant Propagation with respect to the Longitude did upon this so fix it self in Mr  Whiston  's Mind and did occasion such Improvements there that in less than two Days time he brought a small Paper to Mr  Ditton  containing a Scheme how that Theory of Mr  Ditton  's about Sounds might be reduc'd to Practice and be actually apply'd to the discovery of the Longitude at Sea which was then not much unlike the former branch of the following Essay only more imperfect Which Scheme Mr  Ditton  approv'd of Soon after this Mr  Ditton  imparted this Discovery to a very good Friend belonging to the Admiralty in order to gain farther light as to its practicableness at Sea and that proper Questions might by him be ask'd of Seafaring Men relating thereto without any Suspicion  which could not well be avoided if we our selves had ask'd them especially since the Notion was then got abroad that we had a Project about the Longitude to propose to the World The result of this Enquiry was that those Seamen our Friend enquir'd of did not remember to have heard Sounds at Sea any whit near so far as the beforemention'd Examples shew'd they had been heard at Land which difficulty put some stop to our Progress for a little while However at last after farther enquiry the final result was this That tho' Sounds were not ordinarily either at Sea or Land heard very far yet that was not at Sea more than at Land any certain Argument that they could not spread so far because Sounds had been heard a full Degree at least or Geographical Miles over Sea even without any extraordinary Contrivance  either at the sounding Body or the Ear both which were yet for certain capable of great improvements in order to the enlargement of that distance So that the Objection started against the spreading of Sounds at Sea seem'd to be in a manner over and we at liberty to prosecute our Design as before of discovering the Longitude by means of it About this time Mr  Whiston  discover'd and propos'd a great Improvement of his own to this Method  viz  That the Guns which were to make the Explosions in the former Case might also carry Shells full of Powder or such other combustible Matter as would take fire at the utmost Altitude and thereby certainly and exactly exhibit the point of the Azimuth and the Distance of the sounding Body and so join the use of the Eye and Ear together for the same purpose Tho' at the first he must  own he suspected that the Apparent Diameter of that Light or Fire would in great distances be so small as not to be there visible In this very juncture a day of extraordinary Fireworks happen'd it was the Thanksgiving day for the Peace  July  th the Contemplation of which did much revive and encourage this Notion and the certain Account he soon had that those Fireworks nay the small Stars into which the Rockets commonly resolv'd themselves were plainly visible no less than Miles put an end to his doubts immediately and made him very secure that such large Shells as might be fir'd at a vastly greater height would for certain be visible for about Miles which he look'd on as nearly the limit of Sounds also as to any purposes of Longitude This Improvement of Mr  Whiston  's which was also then for the main the same  with the second Branch now contain'd in this Paper was also approv'd of by Mr  Ditton  and agreed to as fit to be a part of the former Design for the Discovery of the Longitude at Sea Mr  Ditton  did farther add for Improvement a sure Method of Trigonometrical Calculation to ascertain from the Observations the horary Difference of Meridians and by consequence the Difference of Longitude in Degrees between the Ship's Place and that of Explosion without computing the Time of the Sound's propagation but since this Method is somewhat more operose than that which is propos'd hereafter he chooses to omit it He did also first observe that great Use of our Method at Land in the Surveying of Countries for the Perfection of Geography which was also readily taken notice of by Sir  Isaac Newton  and afterward by Dr  Halley  and  that both of their own accord upon our first communication of our Method to them For when Matters were brought to so hopeful a Posture and necessary Tables were preparing for the actual Practice of the whole Method we began to think of intimating to the Publick that we had a new Discovery as to the Longitude to propose to the World Which we soon did by our Letter inserted in the Paper call'd the  Guardian  of  July  and repeated by another in the same Author's Paper call'd the  Englishman  of  December  following Having before communicated the matter to the illustrious Sir  Isaac Newton  as we did afterward to those great Men Dr  Clarke  Rector of St  James  's Dr  Halley  of  Oxford  and Mr  Cotes  of  Cambridge  How far we profited by this Communication and what their Opinions were concerning our Method we need not  say because we do not give Account here of every occasional Improvement either of our own or others and because we now publish the intire Method as it stands at present to the whole World for every one's open Judgment and the farther Improvements of the skilful Only so far their Opinions and Declarations appear to have been on our side that upon hearing what they and we had to say the Committee of the House of Commons which was appointed to inquire into this matter came unanimously to a Resolution in our Favour and the Legislature have thereupon thought fit to pass an Act appointing a noble Reward for such as shall discover a better Method than has been hitherto us'd for the finding the Longitude Which Reward whether we have any just Claim to in whole or in part we do hereby intirely submit to the Sagacity and  Justice of those eminent Persons whom the Legislature has been pleas'd to intrust with the Tryal Experiment Judgment and Determination of all such Proposals  We conclude all with our hearty Wishes as  Men  that this our Design may tend to the common Benefit of Mankind as  Britains  that it may tend particularly to the Honour and Advantage of this our Native Country and as  Christians  that it may tend to the Propagation of our Holy Religion in its original Purity throughout the World  London  July  William Whiston Humphry Ditton  PROBLEM To find the LONGITUDE both at Sea and Land  LEMMATA or Preparatory Propositions  I ALL Sounds are propagated almost evenly and are observ'd to move Measur'd or Geographical Miles in one Minute of Time  i e  one Geographical Mile or Minute of a Degree in five Seconds  This is well known from the last and most accurate Observations  Philos Transact  N  o    Sir  Isaac Newton  's Princip Edit      about  the Velocity of Sounds which are those of Mr  Dereham  Only a small Addition of Velocity is to be made when a strong Wind carries the Sound with it and Substraction when it opposes it  II The Sound of a great Gun may be heard by the Ear duly assisted if the Wind be favourable or still both by Sea and Land at the least measur'd or geographical Miles In the open Sea also the Point of the Compass may be nearly determin'd whence it comes  This is very probable as to the Distance from many known Experiments  Philos Transact  p  wherein the Ear even unassisted has heard such Sounds much farther And if the Sound were increas'd by a sounding Board which might prevent its diffusion upwards  and so spread it farther Horizontally on all sides and if the Ear were assisted by a hollow Tube of Metal of the shape of a Bell or Tunnel apply'd thereto this Proposition would soon be more indisputable Nor is there any great Difficulty as to the Point of the Compass whence the Sound comes at Sea where nothing can reflect or echo the same in any other than the true Angle  III The Distance of the sounding Body where the Sounds are of the same Strength and Tenor and Circumstances may within some Latitude be determin'd by the Ear duly assisted and frequently exercis'd in such Observations even at very considerable Distances from the sounding Body  This appears from the obvious difference of the same Sounds at very  different Distances at present which is in a duplicate Proportion of those Distances and from the great Improvements Experiments made on purpose would probably afford us therein  NB  In order to determine accurately the Distance of a given Sound there must be distinct Trials made in an open Place both by Sea and Land in clear and in foggy Weather with the Wind in all Positions and of all Degrees of Strength and this at several Distances of the Hearers but till that is done we must leave this matter to the Ear alone  IV A strong Wind carries Sound along with it in a Circle where the Sounding Body is a Point in its Axis and is more or less remote from its Center according as the Wind is greater or less  This appears by the Demonstration following Let the Proportion of the Velocity of the Wind to the Velocity of the Motion of the Air that causes the Sound be as AB to AD  Let the two equal Circles GDHE GCHF be described upon the Centers A and B and let any Line as KL be drawn Parallel to DF KI will therefore be always equal to  ML or to the Velocity of the Wind and according to its direction as AM = AK = BL = BI will be equal to the Velocity of the Motion of the Air that causes the sound and according to its direction or from the Center to the Circumference of that Circle which includes the sound Whence the Diagonals BK BM will be the distance or measure of the Equal sounds and the points K M will be in the Circumference of that Circle GDHE of which the sounding body B is a point in its Axis QED  Corollary Because the Lines AB and AK and the Angle BAK are given the distance of equal sounds BK is also given by plain Trigonometry As the same line may be found Geometrically also by applying its length to a scale of equal parts  Coroll Two equal Circles sliding one upon the other according the direction of the Axis FD is the readiest way of solving this Problem for the use of Seamen as being so very easy in Practice  V The Interval of apparent time in two places where a Sound is excited and where it is received besides that which is due to the real propagation of the Sound it self is the Difference of their Meridians or of their Longitude in Time  Thus if a Sound excited just at a clock at one place comes to another after the very same Time that is due to the Sounds propagation as at the distance of measured Miles one minute after At the distance of such Miles two minutes after c 'tis evident the places are under the  same Meridian and have no difference of Longitude But if it be heard sooner or later than those times the Difference is what answers to the Temporary difference of their Meridians or of Longitude Westward or Eastward and so is a sure indication of the same As is very obvious on a little consideration and as we shall shew presently by example  VI An Ordinary Great Gun is easily able to cast a Projectil about a Mile and a quarter or English feet in perpendicular height  This appears by that known  Halley ap Transact Philosph  N  o  Mr Anderson's  Gunn passim  Theorem in the Art of Gunnery which demonstrates that the utmost Altitude is always equal to half the utmost Random of the same Gun and Powder  which utmost Random of ordinary Great Guns with a very small charge of Powder is known to be about two Miles and a half or Feet  NB  That it appears by the same way that the largest Great Guns with their largest charge of Powder are able to cast a Projectil twice nay thrice and even four times the beforementioned height But because the charges and trouble are in such cases much greater and it is uncertain whether the advantages will be proportionably augmented we choose to speak moderately especially before tryal and to propose nothing here but what is for certain cheap practicable and advantagious and leave those more surprizing heights to the consideration of the publick afterward Only with this observation that the Altitude will ever be as the Squares of the Velocity with which the Projectil is thrown  VII The time of the Ascent or Descent of such a Projectil without the consideration of the resistance of the Air which in the case of lead bullets iron shels or the like dense bodies is but very small and in Wood not very great is ″ or ⅓ of a Minute and is always the same in the same height  This appears from the known Velocity of descending or ascending bodies  Ubi Supra  which fall or rise ▪ English Feet in one second of time and by consequence Feet in ″ those lines of descent or ascent being known to be ever as the Squares of the Times  VIII Gunpowder may be discharged or combustible matter set on Fire at that utmost height  This all that deal in Rockets Bombs and Mortars do very well know It being the great business of their art to proportion the Match or Fusee to any particular time when it shall give Fire which may as well be always adjusted to ″ as to any other number Nor indeed is it impossible to contrive all so that the very beginning of the descent shall be immediately instrumental in that matter and thereby render the experiment more exact and infallible  IX Fire or Light Feet high will be visible in the night time when the Air is tolerably clear about measured or Geographical Miles  i e  one whole degree and minutes of a great Circle from the place where it is even upon the surface of the Sea  This is easily deduced from the Tables of Tangents and Secants applyed to our Earth as will appear presently Only it may be noted that the Refraction of Light out of the somewhat thinner Air above into the somewhat thicker Air beneath increases this distance a little as also that an Eye upon the Mast of a Ship will see such Fire or Light Miles farther than one on a Level with the Surface of the Sea as will appear presently also  NB  That the Distances this Fire or Light can be seen abating the consideration of the Atmosphere are nearly in a subduplicate proportion of the Altitudes and so at four times the height here mentioned to which yet we have observed Projectils may be thrown this distance will be nearly twice as large  i e  about measured or Geographical Miles even  without the allowance for refraction or for the elevation of Mountains whereon such Guns may be plac'd both which when allowed for will imply that 'tis possible if the light be strong enough to extend this distance to between and Geographical Miles or minutes of a great Circle A vast extent this and capable of affording proportionably vast advantages to Mankind upon the present foundation  X The Angle such fire or light is seen above the Horrizon will very exactly discover its distance as will an easy observation its Azimuth  The former branch is evident from the nature of a Sphere with the usual Tables of Tangents and Secants and may thus be computed by plain Trigonometry Supposing the eye of  the Spectator placed at the surface of the Sea and not considering the very small difference by the refraction  Let A represent the Earth's Center BD the length of the Secant of °  ′ above the Radius or feet ED the Tangent of the same Angle CB the length of the Secant above the Radius at any lesser Angle as BAF and CF the Tangent of that last Angle 'Tis evident that the Angle DFC is the elevation of the fire or light above the horizon at any given Point F and that in the plain Triangle DCF the Angle DCF is given equal to a right Angle and to the Angle FAB FCB is its complement and equal to the sum of the remote Angles CFD and CDF The including sides also CF and CD are given the former being the Tangent of the given Angle FAB and the latter the difference of the Secant of the same Angle from the Secant of ° So that by the known Rule of plain Trigonometry as the sum of the sides CF + CD is to their difference  CF CD or CD CF So is the Tangent of the Semisum of the Angles ½ CFD + ½ CDF = ½ FCB to the Tangent of their Semidifference Which Semidifference substracted at remoter and added at nearer distances to that Semisum gives the Angle sought CFD QEI  According to this Rule the following Table is made to every Minute or Geographical Mile for the ease of all that may use this Method and may desire some exactness therein  Miles distance  Angle above the Horizon                                                  Miles distance  Angle above the Horizon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Miles distance  Angle above the Horizon                                                      NB  It appears by this Table that the distance will never be less exact in this Method than is the Observation of the Altitude since one Mile here never corresponds to less than one Minute but that generally the distance is much more exact than the Observation Since one Mile commonly corresponds to considerably more than one minute nay at very near distances to more than one whole degree as is evident by inspection As for the observation of the Azimuth 'tis too easie to need any demonstration  NB  If the Eye be elevated above the surface of the Sea it will see the fire or light farther according to the following Table  Miles distant  Elevation in feet                                                  XI If the fire or light can be rendred compleatly visible during the intire time of the ascent or descent as in the ordinary Skyrockets its Distance may be exactly determin'd also from the time it appears above the Horizon by the use of the following Tables even without the knowledge of the Angle of Elevation  A Table of the number of feet that Bodies fall or rise as far as ″ of time  ″  feet    ▪    ▪                                                                          A Table of the Excess of the Secants in Feet above the Earths Semidiameter as far as ° ′  ′  feet                                                                                                                  ′  feet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      NB  The Rule for Practice is this Observe the Number of the Seconds of Time that you see the Fire or Light either ascending or descending in the former Table with its corresponding Number of Feet Take this Number of Feet out of the entire Number and keep the Remainder For where that Remainder is found in the latter Table you will find the true Distance over against it  e g  Suppose the Light or Fire is observ'd to take up ″ or a fifth Part of a Minute in its visible Ascent or Descent The corresponding Number of Feet in the former Table is which deducted from leaves for the Difference Which Number in the latter Table corresponds to somewhat above ′ and shews that the real Distance sought is somewhat above Minutes or geographical Miles The Demonstration is easy from the former  Scheme For  DB DC = CB  and so  DA DC = CA  or the Difference of the Secant of ° ′ and of any Part of it visible in another Horizon as at  F  is equal to the Secant of that Angle  DAF  or of the Arch  BF  which is the Distance required Only if the Bottom of the Atmosphere be too thick to permit the Light or Fire to be seen to any certain Altitude allowance must be made for the same in the use of these Tables  XII When a Sound and a Light are made at the same Place either at the same time or at any given Interval the Distance of such Sound and Light from the Auditor or Spectator may be exactly determin'd  For if they are made at the very same time the Difference of the Velocity of Light which is physically speaking instantaneous and of Sound  which goes geographical Miles in a Minute will with great Exactness determine that Distance And if there be a given Interval between them it is easily allow'd for  XIII If the Longitude or Latitude of one Place be known and the Distance and Position of another be also known the Longitude and Latitude of this other Place is known also  This is too obvious to need a Demonstration and may be easily shew'd on a Map with a Pair of Compasses apply'd to the Scale of that Map  XIV If the Longitude or Latitude of one Place be known and its Distance from another be known also and the Longitude of that other Place be otherwise known its Latitude is thereby known And if  its Latitude be otherwise known its Longitude is thereby known also  This is also too obvious to need a Demonstration and may be shewed on a Map as well as the foregoing  XV Hulls of Ships without Sails or Rigging may be fixed at Sea in all ordinary Cases by Anchors and in extraordinary Cases where the Ocean is vastly deep by Weights let down from the Hulls quite through the upper Currents into the still Waters below as near as possible to the Bottom  This Matter belongs to Tryal and Experimenrs and is not to be here particularly demonstrated Only we may observe that the lower Parts of the Waters in the Ocean are commonly found to be free from the Currents and Motions of the higher Parts and that the Method by which those very Currents are discovered is no other than  by thus letting down the Lead far below them which tho' it touch not the Bottom yet makes the Boat out of which the Lead is thrown in the Words of an EyeWitness  Philos Trans  No    Abridg Vol    p    ride as firmly as if it were fastened by the strongest Cable and Anchor to the Bottom  NB  If any Current or strong Wind does in some measure carry away such an Hull with any ordinary Lead or Weights care is to be taken that the Cord or Chain be upward as small and make as little Resistance to the flowing Water as possible and that the same Cord or Chain with its Weights or Leads below be as large and cumbersome and make as great Resistance to the still Water below as possible that so the Motion of the Hull may be insensible Note also that in case there appear still some Motion in the Hull the Mariners are nicely to observe its Velocity and Direction and at convenient  Seasons to bring it back again as near as possible to its original Station  NB  These Hulls may be fixed in proper Places as to Latitude by the known Methods of observing the Latitude and as to Longitude by Eclipses of the Sun or Moon or of  Jupiter  's Planets or by the Moon's Appulse to fixed Stars or rather by an actual Mensuration of Distances on the Surface of the Sea by Trigonometry just as Monsieur  Picard  and  Cassini  measur'd the Length of a Degree of a great Circle on the Land while the Light to be thrown up from the Ships will afford the same Advantage that any elevated Mark does at Land and while the vastly greater Length of a Basis or measur'd Line on the Shore the vastly greater Distances of the Ships and the much greater Evenness of the Surface of the Sea than of the Land do give us hopes of more Exactness in this Way of Mensuration than in any other  NB  By the same Method if done with sufficient Accuracy we may also hope to discover the Quantity of a Degree in all sorts of great Circles and perhaps more exactly than even Monsieur  Picard  or  Cassini  have been able to do because we may hereby actually measure a much larger Portion of such great Circles than they could Which Advantage of this Method is in itself very considerable also  XVI If the Altitude of the Sun at the best Advantage can be taken within four Minutes of a Degree at Sea or Land the time is thereby determined to about half a Minute if to two Minutes of a Degree the time is determin'd to about a quarter of a Minute even in our Latitude while nearer the Equator the like Limits determin the time still more exactly  This the Astronomers well know and any that observe in common Quadrants how an Hour in the middle between Noon and either Morning or Evening contains usually about or Degrees of Altitude while no less than Degrees makes an Hour upon the Equator will easily agree to this Proposition  XVII The best time for the exact Discovery of the Hour at Sea and of adjusting all Watches or Movements to shew the same afterwards is that of the rising and setting of the Sun that is in case Allowance be made for the Horizontal Refraction of his Rays but not otherwise  For if the time while the whole Body of the Sun is rising or setting which may be very nicely observ'd at Sea be added at Night to and substracted in the Morning from the Time that any Table of its rising  and setting or a particular Trigonometrical Calculation does determine the Sum in the first and Difference in the second Case will give the true Time when the Sun's Center will appear to be in the very Horizon And this because the Sun's Horizontal Refraction is observ'd to be very nearly equal to his apparent Diameter  NB  The Exact time of the Sun's rising and setting at all Declinations and in all Latitudes is found by the following Rule of Trigonometry  Out of half the Sum of the Complement of the Sun's Declination and of the Complement of the Latitude of the Place and of an Arch of ° deduct severally the two former Sides to gain two Differences Then say  As the Rectangle of the Sines of thofe two former Sides to the square of the Radius so is the Rectangle of the Sines of those two Differences to the Square of the Sine of half the Angle at the Pole included between  the same two Sides which Angle is the Measure of the Time  For Example Suppose an Hull of a Ship was fix'd in the Latitude of  London  and there were occasion to compute exactly the Time of the rising and setting of the Sun for the longest Day of the Year The Calculation is thus  Compl of Declin  °  ′  Compl Lat      Quadrant      Sum      Half  °  ′  ″  Deduct        First Differ        Deduct from the former Half        Second Differ        Log sin  ° ′ ″    A  Log sin      B     A  +  B    C  Log rad square       D  Log sin First diff       E  Log sin Second diff

Allowance for Refraction And the Difference of Amplitude when the first Edge of the Sun touches and the last leaves the Horizon is to be added or substracted in this Case to that when it appears to be half set in order to obtain the Sun's true Amplitude as well as we added or substracted the Difference of time before for the exact Adjustment of the true Moment of its rising and setting  The Solution of the Problem  Let a great Gun with a Shell that will take Fire at its utmost Altitude be discharg'd perpendicularly Feet high above the Surface of the Sea every Night exactly at aClock at all convenient Distances and Situations and from known Places This Discharge will by the Distance and Point of the Compass of its Sound nearly give the Longitude and Latitude to all Places or Ships within the hearing thereof And it will by the same Distance and Azimuth of its Light or Fire exactly give the same Longitude and Latitude to all Places or Ships within the Sight thereof according to the foregoing Lemmata  QEI  For Example Let us suppose an Hull fixed in a known place Degrees more Westward than the Meridian of  London  and that every Midnight its Great Gun is discharged as before and that a Ship sailing by at  ′ ″ after Eleven sees the Fire or Light ′ above the Horizon  i e  by a foregoing Table at Minutes or Geographical Miles distance It was therefore a Clock at the Hull when it was only h ′ at the Ship So that the difference of time is ′ and the difference of Longitude upon the Equator ° ′ and the Ships Longitude from the Meridian of  London  is hereby known to be ° ′ Westward  Suppose also that the Weather be such that only the sound can be heard and that it proves to be so weak as to be justly esteem'd Geographical Miles or one Degree of a great Circle distant This Distance answers to ′ of time for the interval of the Propagation of the Sound which therefore if it be heard just at a Clock at the Ship will imply that when the Explosion was made it was at the Ship only ′ past eleven the same moment that it was full at the Hull and that therefore the  difference of Meridians is the same as before viz ′ in time or ° ′ upon the Equator Westward  Suppose farther that the Light be seen at the same time that the Sound is heard with no other than the small difference of the slowness of the Sound in comparison of the instantaneous motion of the Light and that the difference of time between the most elevated appearance of the Light and the hearing of the Sound which may be easily and exactly observ'd by any tolerable movement whatsoever or by a Pendulum that vibrates half Seconds be found to be ′ ″ or which is all one that the intire difference of the Explosion made and of the Sound heard be ′ in time This difference will imply the distance of the Ship from the Explosion to be Geographical Miles And if the sound is heard at the Ship ′ ″▪ after Eleven the difference of Longitude upon the Equator will  still be ° ′ and the real Longitude from  London  will be ° ′ Westward as before  If the Azimuth of the Fire or Light be also observ'd take with your Compasses from your Scale the true distance Minutes or Miles and set it from the place of the Hull on the true Angle in any large Map or SeaChart This will determine the very Point where the Ship is both for Longitude and Latitude The same thing may be done for the Sound in case the Point of the Compass be observ'd also  If the Latitude of the Ship be known take the known distance either by the means of the Light or Fire seen or if the Weather be too Foggy for that of the Sound heard and let it cross the known parallel of Latitude in the Chart and this will determine the Longitude The like is to be done for the Latitude were the Longitude first known But that not being the usual case it needs not be  farther insisted on Nor need we shew how all this may be done by Calculation also since those that understand any thing of Navigation cannot be to seek therein  NB  In case some parts of the Ocean prove so very deep and rough that no Hulls can be fixed in them the way to recover the Longitude which may be by this means interrupted is rightly proposed by Sir  Isaac Newton  himself in his Paper delivered in to the Committee of the House of Commons  viz  to sail obliquely from the last Hull into the Parallel of the next and so along the same till upon approaching to that next Hull the Longitude be anew recover'd and the Voyage be continued as before Nor is this Interruption of any consequence because it cannot happen but in places where there is no Danger and where Seamen are under no concern for the knowledge of the Longitude  OBSERVATIONS  IF in all proper Roads of Ships such a great Gun be plac'd and discharg'd exactly every Midnight whether on Shoars or Islands or in Hulls at the Distances of about Geographical Miles or Degrees All Ships that sail within any tolerable Distance may commonly every Week or Ten Days thereby correct their Reckoning and know their Longitude as well as Latitude even when the Heavens are not clear enough to make Celestial Observations for either  The Ordinary Watches Movements or LogLines in Ships when thus Corrected and Adjusted once in a Week or Ten Days will  well enough shew the Longitude during every one of those short Distances between the Hulls and so will render the knowledge thereof still more universal  If one such Row of Hulls be any where found too defective a double Row may there be laid Pair by Pair in the same or equidistant Meridians with proper Distinctions in the Sounds or the Light to prevent mistaking one Row for the other Nor will there in this Case be room for almost any Uncertainty since even in Cloudy Weather as much as the Wind carries away the Sound of any one so much will it usually bring the Sound of another  If it be any where necessary Masts may be Erected upon Hollow Empty Vessels with White Spheres at their Tops and these Vessels may be fix'd in proper Places at  equal Distances between the Hulls for the more sure guiding the Ships in Places of Danger And since from the Top of any Mast that is Feet High the Top of another as high may be discovered at the Distance of Miles there will hardly be occasion for more of these Vessels any where than one every Miles Nor will these Masts and Vessels be any Annual Charges at all  Besides the great Guns and their solemn Explosions In proper Places at several Havens where there is any Danger at the Entrance of Ships as well as at other convenient Promontories jetting out into the Sea a Rocket may be thrown up from the Top of a Neighbouring Steeple or Hill or the like most elevated Place every Midnight for the Seamens better Direction and Security  Signals of all Sorts may be given by this Method by mutual Agreement As suppose in Storms we would know which way and how strong the Wind is at the nearest Explosion  c  Ships may thus give Signals of Distress to the Hulls or to one another The News of great Events may be also this way carried very soon over the Sea especially if any Ships were plac'd within Sight and Hearing of each others Signals as a Fleet may sail in Times of Peace  c  In short no one knows how far this Method of Communication by these Kinds of Signals may be improv'd and how great a Convenience may hence arise to the several Parts of the Globe especially in the Way of Trade and Commerce and even for the Propagation of Knowledge both Divine and Human throughout the World  If in any clear Night a sufficient Number of such Explosions were made at proper Distances in any Country and convey'd in order from one to another so that the Second Gun were fired when the Light of the First was seen or otherwise with the Observation of the exact apparent Times when they were made when the Light was seen what Angle or how long that Light was above the Horizon and what Azimuth it had both the Longitude and Latitude as well as the Distance and Position of all these Places might by this means be readily determin'd at Land especially if the Experiments were repeated several times and were compar'd one with another And by the same Observations every where the Longitude and Latitude Distance and Position of all other Neighbouring  Places from those and so from another might be readily determin'd also  NB  This Method of Survey is no hard Thing in Practice even to those that know little of the Mathematicks For any Right Angle set by a Plummet or Level with Two Pins or Points for the Eye and for the Object does by the Proportion of its Sides give the Angle above the Horizon by the Angle its Horizontal Side makes with the Meridian it gives the Azimuth and by the Interval of Time between the Light and Sound it gives the Distance of every Place from that of Explosion according to the Figure following  Where AB represents the Horizontal Side of the Norma or Square and BC the Perpendicular Side whose Proportion once given as suppose to the Discovery of the Angle of Elevation CAB is most easy as here ° ′ Where also NS represents the Meridian Line lying from  North  to  South  and the Angle SAB suppose of Degrees Minutes represents the Azimuth  Eastward  We need not add that a Plummet of  Inches  long will vibrate half Seconds for the Interval of Time between the Light seen and the Sound heard Nor is there we think any way yet discover'd of surveying Countries and Kingdoms that can compare with this either for Expedition Certainty or Cheapness A Specimen of which we hope soon to give the World in an Actual Survey of  GreatBritain  and  Ireland  and their Coasts hereby if the Publick please to give us Encouragement and Assistance therein  The way of casting a Shell Feet high is very easy for the same Force or Charge of Gunpowder that will cast any Shell Feet for its utmost Random at the Elevation of Degrees will certainly cast the same Shell perpendicularly upward Feet as we have already observ'd And since the time of this entire perpendicular Projection or Ascent and Descent  together is ″ or some very small Matter more on Account of the Resistance of the Air We have another sure Way of Adjusting the same Projection to that Height  viz  by observing what Quantity of Powder will cast the Shell high enough to stay very little above ″ in the Air before it falls to the Ground  This Method of firing Powder or other combustible Matter at or very near the utmost Height of Feet may be well enough put in practice even tho' some considerable Error should be committed in the adjusting the Fusee to give Fire in ″ Since the Mistake of even a Fifth Part or Four entire Seconds in that Case would produce but an Error of the th Part of the whole Altitude and the Mistake of a Tenth Part or Two Seconds would occasion an Alteration of no more than the Hundredth Part thereof  This is evident because this Time belongs to the highest Part of the Projectils Motion which is the slowest And because the Lines describ'd by all Ascending and Descending Bodies are still in a Duplicate Proportion of the Times of such their Ascent and Descent  If one or more Rows of such Hulls were laid in the same or Equidistant Meridians Southward or otherways Ships might with greater Safety than formerly go to discover those Parts of the Globe which are hitherto undiscover'd Nor can we at present guess what Advantages may thereby accrue to the Parts of the World already discovered  Every one of these Hulls may be Places of Observation as to the Variation of the Needle to the Currents to the Soil the Fowls the Fishes and other  Phaenomena  of the  several Places where they are fixed and an excellent Means of keeping up a mutual Correspondence between the several Parts of the Globe for all useful Purposes whatsoever  As this Method ought to be put in Practice by the Consent of all Trading Nations so ought every one of the Hulls employ'd therein to have a legal Protection from them all And it ought to be a great Crime with every one of them if any other Ships either injure them or endeavour to imitate their Explosions for the Amusement and Deception of any  Since the Charges of the Powder for each Gun will be very small since the Shells and their Contents come to no great Price neither since the Persons employ'd in the Hulls may be in part taken out of such Places where they are  maintain'd at the Publick Charge already and so will require only some Additional Rewards or Future Privileges for such their Service And since the LandExplosions which will be much the most numerous will be withal much the cheapest It will appear upon the Whole that the Annual or Constant Expences of this Method will be comparatively very small and inconsiderable especially if they are as they ought to be equally distributed among the several Trading Nations of the World  The Advantages of this Method  THIS Method requires no Depth of Astronomy no Nicety in Instruments and but seldom any Celestial Observations at all either as to the Latitude or the Hour at the Ship and so is to even the common Sailors the  most Practicable  It does generally determine the very Place of the Ship both as to  Longitude  and  Latitude  at once and so is the  most Compendious  It does generally determine the very Place to a few Miles at the farthest and so is the  most Accurate  It affords Help even in Cloudy and Foggy Weather when no Celestial Observations can be made and the  Latitude  it self cannot be otherwise found and so is the  most General  It will frequently afford a double Observation Two successive Nights from the same Hull to the same Ship and so is the  most secure  It will commonly afford a double way of Observation at the same time by the Eye and by the Ear which will confirm or correct one another and so is the  most certain  The more inaccurate Branch by the Sound is not only more universal than the other but is also much more exact than any Method formerly discover'd So that in the very worst Circumstances this way is certainly the  very best  It is the most undoubted and exact where there is the greatest Want and Danger And if it should at all be deficient it is there only where there is no Danger and hardly any occasion for knowing the Longitude as has been shew'd already So that on all Accounts it is plainly the  most Useful  and  Advantageous  APPENDIX  IT is farther humbly propos'd to the Learned Whether it may not be proper for all Nations upon this Occasion to agree upon one  first Meridian  or beginning of  Longitude  for the common Benefit of  Geography  And whether it may not be proper in that Case to fix it to the  Pike of Tenariff  as the most noted Place already and as the Place whence the Highest and most generally useful Explosion must in this Method be made every Midnight continually for the Discovery of the  Longitude  it self
