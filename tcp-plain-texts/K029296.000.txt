BOADEN  Esq    SPOKEN  by Mr  HOLMAN  HOW narrow is the sphere a modern Bays  Is doom'd to range while he contrives his Plays  Still urg'd by folly Beings to explore  Whom  he  and  you  so often saw before  Precluded characters by  their  advance  Whose minds could pierce thro' Nature with a glance  And still of right possess the moral Stage  With lessons studied in a distant age  In this our glass you yet reflected find  The levities which lessen human kind  The lighter follies which the Town engage  All that prevail in fashion makesthe Rage  Yes all though various be the motly forms  That sway by weak'ning or compel in storms  That up to Fop evaporate the Lord  Or down to Jockey sink the Maid ador'd  Confound distinctions firm and frail perplex  And make it difficultto guess even sex  But is the Rage to levity confin'd  Does no just passion sway the general mind  Lo the rough Veteran whom his Country's claim  Rouses to vindicate her injured name  The  Rage  is  Conquest  which his bosom fires  The foe yields thenno then his rage expires  When in some dreadful contest on the wave  The gallant seaman finds a wat'ry grave  E'er the last pulse of ebbing life be o'er  When the eye turns towards his native shore  This thought may ev'n the parting pang assuage  That there  Humanity  is still the  Rage  Our Author's Muse follows with fashion's gale  Down a smooth river an amusive sail  She dares no sea where boisterous passions sway  Or merely dips her wing and hastes away  O may her airy toil your love engage  And her new flight to please you be  The Rage  EPILOGUE TO  THE RAGE    Written by  EDWARD TOPHAM  Esq    SPOKEN  by Mrs  MATTOCKS  WELL Gentlefolks again your most obedient  That I'm the Epilogue is held expedient  Our Bard who for a youth well knows the Stage  Thought as to speaking Women were "The Rage"  And said"Good Mrs Mattocks pray advance  Females must now step forward as in France"  My answer wasmy dear kind Sir have pity  "Pray spare the LadiesMen secure our city  "For arm'd by Parliament to calm each fear  "Huge corps of CommonCouncilmen appear  "Wards Liveries Deputies en Militaire  "Led by LieutenantColonelmy Lord Mayor  "Each man

my horse would do some mischief yet'  Thus meaning no offence in language faint  The City Rage for soldiering we paint  But sure no sons of Briton wish represt  That zeal which leads one man to serve the rest  Which strives due right and order to maintain  Against a Chaos that would come again  Long may such Rage inspire the English mind  In neighbouring Climes a different "Rage" we find  Poor  Jean François  who shouts for Liberté  Finds Slavery still the Order of the Day  "Ma foi he criesno people blest as we  They force me out to fight to make me free  Den vif alertbegar we must not tarry  My Vife for common good oblige to marry  She labour for the State tant mieux pour elle  She forget meI herc'est Bagatelle  Allons au Guerre L'eau de vie banish sorrow  Victoire todayLa Guillotine

that  gulleting  machine d'ye see  "I've no idea how it makes one free  "For my part now whatever may be said  "I'm for a little meat and safe warm bed  "I does not relish freedomwhen one's dead  "So once for all my means and resolution  "Go to stand by the good old Constitution"  Such and so different reign with sovereign power  The various "Rages" of the present hour  I wish in truth I wish in very spight  Your Rage may be to see us many a night  THE RAGE A COMEDY  ACT I  SCENE IDARNLEY'S  Garden and view of his small Villa  Enter  DARNLEY  and Sir  GEORGE GAUNTLET  SIR GEORGE  AND so

GeorgeSince I retir'd to this peaceful spot I have not had a wish be∣yond it I've been so happy in that humble cottage that when I'm doom'd to leave it the world will be a waste and life not have a charm  Sir George  How you are alter'd Darnley When we were brother officers you were the greatest rake in the regiment but from the  time we were quarter'd at Worcester where you first beheld Miss Dormer  Darnley  I saw the folly of my former life I own'd the power of her superior charms and leaving a busy and tumultuous world retir'd with her to this sequester'd scene'tis now three years since I married  Sir George  And from that time to this have you liv'd in this outoftheway place  Darnley  Yes and till you yesterday honour'd me with a visit I have not seen a friend within my doorsbut isn't it a happy life Sir George Our affections have room to shootcare and distrust are banish'd from our cottage and with such a woman as Mrs Darnley to con∣verse with what is the world to me I can defy and scorn its malice  Sir George  She's an angelic creature indeed Darnley and at Worcester I had myself near∣ly fallen a victim to her charms but about your future lifedo you mean to live for ever in these woods and meadows  Darnley  Nowould to heaven I couldI fear I must forego my present calm and mix in active life again When I married I sold my commission you remember to purchase this
