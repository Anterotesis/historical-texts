PLAY As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  Written Originally by  W SHAKESPEARE  And now Revised and Adapted to the Stage By Mr THEOBALD the Author of  Shakespeare Restor'd  Quod optanti

George Dodington    Esq  SIR  _NOTHING can more strongly second the Pleasure I feel from the UniversalApplause which crowns this  Orphan  Play than this Other which I take in presuming to shelter it under Your Name I bear so dear an Affection to the Writings and Memory of SHAKESPEARE that as it is my good Fortune to retrieve this Remnant of his Pen from Obscurity so it is my greatest Ambition that  this Piece should be received into the Protection of such a Patron And I hope Future Times when they mean to pay  Shakespeare  the best Compliment will remember to say Mr DODINGTON was that Friend to his  Remains  which his own SOUTHAMPTON was to his  living Merit  It is from the  fine Discernment  of our Patrons that we can generally best promise Ourselves the good Opinion of the Publick You are not only a distinguish'd  Friend  of the  Muses  but most intimately  allied  to them And from hence it is I flatter Myself that if You shall think fit to pronounce this Piece genuine it will silence the Censures of those  Unbelievers  who think it impossible a  Manuscript of  Shakespeare  could so long have lain dormant and who are blindly paying Me a greater Compliment than either They design or I can merit while they cannot but confess Themselves  pleased  yet would fain insinuate that they are  imposed upon  I should esteem it some Sort of  Virtue  were I able to commit so  agreeable  a  Cheat  But pardon Me Sir for a Digression that perverts the very Rule of Dedications I own I have my Reasons for it As SIR your known Integrity and Honour engages the warmest Wishes of all good Men for your Prosperity so your known Distinction in polite Letters and your generous Encouragement of Those who pretend to them obliges us to consider your Advancement  as our own personal Interest and as a good Omen at least if not as the surest Means of the future flourishing Condition of those  Humane  Arts amongst us which We  profess  and which You  adorn  But neither Your Modesty nor my Inability will suffer me to enter upon that Subject Permit me therefore SIR to convert  Panegyrick  into a most ardent Wish that You would look with a Tender Eye on this  dear Relick  and that you would believe me with the most unfeigned Zeal and Respect  SIR  Your most Devoted and Obedient Humble Servant LEW THEOBALD  Great Russellstree  st December  PREFACE OF THE EDITOR  _THE Success which this Play has met with from the Town in the Representation to say nothing of the Reception it found from those Great Judges to whom I have had the Honour of communicating it in Manuscript has almost made the Purpose of a Preface unnecessary And therefore what I have to say is design'd rather to wipe out a flying Objection to two than to labour at proving it the Production of  Shakespeare  It has been alledg'd as incredible that such a Curiosity should be stifled and lost to the World for above a Century To This my Answer is short that tho' it never till now made its Appearance on the Stage yet one of the Manuscript Copies which I have is of above Sixty Years Standing in the Handwriting of Mr  Downes  the famous Old Prompter and as I am credibly inform'd was early in the Possession of the celebrated Mr  Betterton  and by Him design'd to have been usher'd into the World What Accident prevented This Purpose of his I do not pretend to know Or thro' what hands it had successively pass'd before that Period of Time There is a Tradition which I have from the Noble Person who supply'd me with One of my Copies that it was given by our Author as a Present of Value to a Natural Daughter of his for whose Sake he wrote it in the Time of his Retirement from the Stage Two other Copies I have one of which I was glad to purchase  at a very good Rate which may not perhaps be quite so Old as the Former but One of Them is much more perfect and has fewer Flaws and Interruptions in the Sense  Another Objection has been started which would carry much more Weight with it were it Fact that the Tale of this Play being built upon a Novel in  Don Quixot  Chronology is against Us and  Shakespeare  could not be the Author But it happens that  Don Quixot  was publish'd in the Year and  Shakespeare  did not dye till  April  a sufficient Interval of Time for All that We want granted  Others again to depreciate the Affair as they thought have been pleased to urge that tho' the Play may have some Resemblances of  Shakespeare  yet the  Colouring    Diction  and  Characters  come nearer to the Style and Manner of FLETCHER This I think is far from deserving any Answer I submit it to the Determination of better Judgments tho' my Partiality for  Shakespeare  makes me wish that Every Thing which is good or pleasing in our Tongue had been owing to his Pen  As to the Performance of the respective  Actors  concern'd in this Play my applauding It here would be altogether superfluous The Publick has distinguish'd and given them a Praise much beyond Any that can flow from my Pen But I have some particular Acknowledgments to make to the  Managers  of this Company for which I am glad to embrace so fair an Opportunity  I came to Them at this Juncture as an  Editor  not an  Author  and have met with so much Candour and handsome Treatment from Them that I am willing to believe the Complaint which has so commonly obtain'd of their Disregard and ill Behaviour to Writers has been more severely urg'd than it is justly grounded They must certainly be too good Judges of their own Interest not to know that a Theatre cannot always subsist on old Stock but that the Town requires Novelty at their Hands On the other Hand they must be so far Judges of their own Art and Profession as to know that all the Compositions which are offer'd them would never go down with Audiences of so nice and delicate a Taste as in this Age frequent the Theatres It would be very hard upon such a Community where so many Interests are concern'd and so much Merit in their Business allow'd if they had not a Priviledge of refusing some crude Pieces too imperfect for the Entertainment of the Publick I would not be thought to inferr that they have never discourag'd what They might perhaps afterwards wish they had receiv'd They do not I believe set up for such a Constant  Infallibility But if We do but fairly consider out of above Four Thousand Plays extant how small a Number will now stand the Test if We do but consider too how often a raw Performance has been extoll'd by the Partiality of private Friendship and what a Clamour of Injury has been rais'd from that Quarter upon such Performance meeting a Repulse we may pretty easily account for the Grounds upon which they proceeded in discountenancing some Plays and the harsh Things that are thrown out upon their giving a Repulse to others  But I should beg Pardon for interfering in this Question in which I am properly neither Party nor Judge I am only throwing out a private Opinion without Interest or Prejudice and if I am right in the Notion  Valeat quantum valere potest  PROLOGUE  Written by  PHILIP FROWDE    Esq  And Spoken by Mr WILKS  AS in some Region where indulgent Skies  Enrich the Soil a

your own Command  That his Consent should ratify our Loves  Leon  Perhaps it was but now I've chang'd my Mind  You purchase at too dear a Rate that puts You  To wooe me and your Father too Besides  As He perchance may say you shall not have me  You who are so obedient must discharge me  Out of your Fancy Then you know 'twill prove  My Shame and Sorrow meeting such Repulse  To wear the Willow in my Prime of Youth  Jul  Oh do not rack me with these illplaced Doubts  Nor think tho' Age has in my Father's Breast  Put out Love's Flame he therefore has not Eyes  Or is in Judgment blind You wrong your Beauties  Venus  will frown if you disprize her Gifts  That have a Face would make a frozen Hermit  Leap from his Cell and burn his Beads to kiss it  Eyes that are nothing but continual Births  Of new Desires in Those that view their Beams  You cannot have a Cause to doubt  Leon  Why  Julio  When you that dare not chuse without your Father  And where you love you dare not vouch it must not  Though you have Eyes see with 'emcan I think you  Somewhat perhaps infected with your Suit  Sit down content to say You would but dare not  Jul  Urge not Suspicions of what cannot be  You deal unkindly misbecomingly  I'm loth to say For All that waits on you  Is graced and gracesNo Impediment  Shall bar my Wishes but such grave Delays  As Reason presses Patience with which blunt not  But rather whet

Spirit comes This  I now perceive too plain you care not for me  Duke I obey thy Summons be its Tenour  Whate'er it will If War I come thy Souldier  Or if to waste my silken Hours at Court  The Slave of Fashion I with willing Soul  Embrace the lazy Banishment for Life  Since  Leonora  has pronounc'd my Doom  Leon  What do you mean Why talk you of the Duke  Wherefore of War or Court or Banishment  Jul  How this new Note is grown of me I know not  But the Duke writes for Me Coming to move  My Father in our Bus'ness I did find him  Reading this Letter whose Contents require  My instant Service and Repair to Court  Leon  Now I perceive the Birth of these Delays  Why  Leonora  was not worth your Suit  Repair to Court Ay there you shall perhaps  Rather past Doubt behold some choicer Beauty  Rich in her Charms train'd to the Arts of Soothing  Shall prompt you to a Spirit of Hardiness  To say So please you Father I have chosen  This Mistress for my own  Jul  Still you mistake me  Ever your Servant I profess my self  And will not blot me with a Change for all  That Sea and Land inherit  Leon  But when go you  Jul  To morrow Love so runs the Duke's Command  Stinting our Farewellkisses cutting off  The Forms of Parting and the Interchange  Of thousand precious Vows with Haste too rude  Lovers have Things of Moment to debate  More than a Prince or dreaming Statesman know  Such Ceremonies wait on  Cupid  's Throne  Why heav'd that Sigh  Leon  O  Julio  let me whisper  What but for Parting I should blush to tell thee  My Heart beats thick with Fears lest the gay Scene  The Splendors of a Court should from thy Breast  Banish my Image kill my Int'rest in thee  And I be left the Scoff of Maids to drop  A Widow's Tear for thy departed Faith  Jul  O let Assurance strong as Words can bind  Tell thy pleas'd Soul I will be wond'rous faithful  True as the Sun is to his Race of Light  As Shade to Darkness as Desire to Beauty  And when I swerve let Wretchedness o'ertake me  Great as e'er Falshood met or Change can merit  Leon  Enough I'm satisfied and will remain  Yours with a firm and untir'd Constancy  Make not your Absence long Old Men are wav'ring  And sway'd by Int'rest more than Promise giv'n  Should some fresh Offer start when you're away  I may be prest to Something which must put  My Faith or my Obedience to the Rack  Jul  Fear not but I with swiftest Wing of Time  Will labour my Return And in my Absence  My noble Friend and now our honour'd Guest  The Lord  Henriquez  will in my behalf  Hang at your Father's Ear and with kind Hints  Pour'd from a

be faithful  Ex  Julio  D Bern  His Father is as unsettled as he is wayward in his Disposition If I thought young  Julio  's Temper were not mended by the Mettal of his Mother I should be something crazy in giving my Consent to this Match And to tell you true if my Eyes might be the Directors to your Mind I could in this Town look upon Twenty Men of more delicate Choice I speak not This altogether to unbend your Affections to him But the Meaning of what I say is that you set such Price upon yourself to him as Many and much his Betters would buy you at and reckon those Virtues in you at the rate of their Scarcity to which if he come not up you remain for a better Mart  Leon  My Obedience Sir is chain'd to your Advice  D Bern  'Tis well said and wisely I fear your Lover is a little Follytainted which shortly after it proves so you will repent  Leon  Sir I confess I approve him of all the Men I know but that Approbation is nothing 'till season'd by your Consent  D Bern  We shall

Violante  SCENE III Prospect of a Village before  Don Bernard  's House  Enters  Henriquez  Henr  Where were the Eyes the Voice the various Charms  Each beauteous Particle each nameless Grace  Parents of glowing Love All These in Her  It seems were not but a Disease in Me  That fancied Graces in herWho ne'er beheld  More than a Hawthorne shall have Cause to say  The Cedar's a tall Tree and scorn the Shade  The lov'd Bush once had lent him Soft mine Honour  Begins to sicken in this black Reflection  How can it be that with my Honour safe  I should pursue  Leonora  for my Wife  That were accumulating Injuries  To  Violante  first and now to  Julio    To her a perjur'd Wretch to him perfidious  And to myself in strongest Terms accus'd  Of murth'ring Honour wilfully without which  My Dog's the Creature of the nobler Kind  But Pleasure is too strong for Reason's Curb  And Conscience sinks o'erpower'd with Beauty's Sweets  Come  Leonora  Authress of my Crime  Appear and vindicate thy Empire here  Aid me to drive this ling'ring Honour hence  And I am wholly thine  Enter to him Don  Bernard  and  Leonora  D Bern  Fye my good Lord why would you wait without  If you suspect your Welcome I have brought  My  Leonora  to assure you of it    Henr  salutes  Leon  Henr  O Kiss sweet as the Odours of the Spring  But cold as Dews that dwell on Morning Flow'rs  Say  Leonora  has your Father conquer'd  Shall Duty then at last obtain the Prize  Which you refus'd to Love And shall  Henriquez  Owe all his Happiness to good  Bernardo  Ah no I read my Ruin in your Eyes  That Sorrow louder than a thousand Tongues  Pronounces my Despair  D Bern  Come  Leonora    You are not now to learn this noble Lord  Whom but to name restores my failing Age  Has with a Lover's Eye beheld your Beauty  Thro' which his Heart speaks more than Language can  It offers Joy and Happiness to You  And Honour to our House Imagine then  The Birth and Qualities of him that loves you  Which when you know you cannot rate too dear  Leon  My Father on my Knees I do beseech you  To pause one Moment on your Daughter's Ruin  I vow my Heart ev'n bleeds that I must thank you  For your past Tenderness and yet distrust  That which is yet behind Consider Sir  Whoe'er's th' Occasion of another's Fault  Cannot himself be innocent O give not  The censuring World Occasion to reproach  Your harsh Commands or to my Charge lay That  Which most I fear the Fault of Disobedience  D Bern  Pr'ythee fear neither the One nor the Other I tell thee Girl there's more Fear than Danger For my own part as soon as Thou art married to this noble Lord my Fears will be over  Leon  Sir I should be the vainest of my Sex  Not to esteem myself unworthy far  Of this high Honour Once there was a Time  When to have heard my Lord  Henriquez  ' Vows  Might have subdued my unexperienc'd Heart  And made me wholly hisBut That's now past  And my firmplighted Faith by your Consent  Was long since given to the injur'd  Julio  D Bern  Why then by my Consent e'en take it back again Thou like a simple Wench hast given thy Affections to a Fellow that does not care a Farthing for them One that has left thee for a Jaunt to Court as who should say I'll get a Place now 'tis Time enough to marry when I'm turn'd out of it  Henr  So surely it should seem most lovely Maid  Julio  alas feels nothing of my Passion  His Love is but th' Amusement of an Hour  A short Relief from Business or Ambition  The Sport of Youth and Fashion of the Age  O had he known the Hopes the Doubts the Ardours  Or half the fond Varieties of Passion  That play the Tyrant with my tortur'd Soul  He had not left Thee to pursue his Fortune  To practise Cringes in a slavish Circle  And barter real Bliss for unsure Honour  Leon  Oh the opposing Wind  Should'ring the Tide makes here a fearful Billow  I needs must perish in itOh my Lord  Is it then possible you can forget  What's due to your great Name and princely Birth  To Friendship's holy Law to Faith repos'd  To Truth to Honour and poor injur'd  Julio  O think my Lord how much this  Julio  loves you  Recall his Services his welltry'd Faith  Think too this very Hour wheree'er he be  Your Favour is the Envy of the Court  And secret Triumph of his grateful Heart  Poor  Julio  how securely thou depend'st  Upon the Faith and Honour of thy Master  Mistaken Youth this very Hour he robs thee  Of all thy Heart holds dear'Tis so  Henriquez  Repays the Merits of unhappy  Julio  Weeps  Henr  My slumb'ring Honour catches the Alarm  I was to blame to parley with her thus  Sh'as shown me to myself It troubles me  Aside  D Bern  Mad Mad Stark mad by this Light  Leon  I but begin to be soI conjure you  By all the tender Interests of Nature  By the chaste Love 'twixt you and my dear Mother▪  O holy Heav'n that she were living now  Forgive and pity meOh Sir remember  I've heard my Mother say a thousand Times  Her Father would have forced her Virgin Choice  But when the Conflict was 'twixt Love and Duty  Which should be first obey'd my Mother quickly  Paid up her Vows to Love and married You  You thought this well and she was praised for This  For this her Name was honour'd Disobedience  Was ne'er imputed to her her firm Love  Conquer'd whate'er oppos'd it and she prosper'd  Long Time your Wife My Case is now the same  You are the Father which You then condemn'd  I what my Mother was but not so happy  D Bern  Go to you're a Fool No doubt You have old Stories enough to undo youWhat you can't throw yourself away but by Precedent haYou will needs be married to One that will None of You You will be happy no Body's way but your own forsoothBut d'ye mark me spare your Tongue for the future and That's using you hardly too to bid you spare what you have a great deal too much of Go go your ways and d'ye hear get ready within these Two days to be married to a Husband you don't deserveDo it or by my dead Father's Soul you are no Acquaintance of mine  Henr  She weeps Be gentler to her good  Bernardo  Leon  Then Woe the DayI'm circled round with Fire  No Way for my Escape but thro' the Flames  Oh can I e'er resolve to live without  A Father's Blessing or abandon  Julio  With other Maids the Choice were not so hard  Int'rest that rules the World has made at last  A Merchandize of Hearts and Virgins now  Chuse as they're bid and wed without Esteem  By nobler Springs shall my Affections move  Nor own a Master but the Man I love  Exit  Leonora  D Bern  Go thy ways ContradictionFollow her my Lord follow her in the very Heat This Obstinacy must be combated by Importunity as obstinate  Exit  Henriquez  after her  The Girl says right her Mother was just such Another I remember Two of Us courted her at the same Time She lov'd neither of Us but She chose me purely to spight

while I tell you the whole Truth of the Matter My Daughter you must know is such a tender Soul she cannot possibly see a Duke's younger Son without falling desperately in Love with him Now you know Neighbour when Greatness rides Post after a Man of my Years 'tis both Prudence and good Breeding to let one's self be overtaken by it And who can help all This I profess it was not my seeking Neighbour  Cam  I profess a Fox might earth in the Hollowness of your Heart Neighbour and there's an End If I were to give a bad Conscience its true Likeness it should be drawn after a very near Neighbour to a certain poor Neighbour of yoursNeighbour with a Pox  D Bern  Nay you are so nimble with me you will hear Nothing  Cam  Sir if I must speak Nothing I will hear Nothing As for what you
