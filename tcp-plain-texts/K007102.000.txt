MB  In these Memoirs which were published in London soon after the death of Dr Goldsmith were several mistakes with respect to our author's age the time of his admission into the college of Dublin c which are here corrected from accurate information  OLIVER GOLDSMITH son of the Reverend Charles Goldsmith was born at Elphin in the county of Roscommon in Ireland in the year His father had four sons of whom Oliver was the third After being well instructed in the classics at the school of Mr Hughes he was admitted a sizer in  Trinitycollege Dublin on the th of June While he resided there he exhibited no specimens of that genius which in his maturer years raised his character so high On the th of February O S two years after the regular time he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts Soon after he turned his thoughts to the profession of physic and after attending some courses of anatomy in Dublin proceeded to Edinburgh in the year where he studied the several branches of medicine under the different professors in that university His beneficent disposition soon involved him in unexpected difficulties and he was obliged precipitately to leave Scotland in consequence of having engaged himself to pay a considerable sum of money for a fellowstudent  A FEW days after about the beginning of the year he arrived at Sunderland near Newcastle where he was arrested at the suit of one Barclay a taylor in Edinburgh to whom he had given security for his friend By the friendship of Mr Laughlin Maclane and Dr Sleigh who were then in the college he was soon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff and took his passage on board a Dutch ship to Rotterdam where after a short stay he proceeded to Brussels He then visited great part of Flanders and after passing some time at Strasbourg and Louvain where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in physic he accompanied an English gentleman to Geneva  IT is undoubtedly fact that this ingenious unfortunate man made most part of his tour on  foot  "Countries wear different appearances to travellers of different circumstances A man who is whirled through Europe in a postchaise and the pilgrim who walks the grand tour on foot will form very different conclusions  Haud inexpertus loquor  "  Goldsmith  's Present State of Learning in Europe    He had left England with very little money and being of a philosophical turn and at that time possessing a body capable of sustaining every fatigue and a heart not easily terrified by danger he became an enthusiast to the design he had formed of seeing the manners of different countries He had some knowledge of the French language and of music he played tolerably well on the German flute which from an amusement became at some times the means of subsistence His learning produced him an hospitable reception at most of the religious houses that he visited and his music made him welcome to the peasants of Flanders and Germany  'Whenever I approached a peasant's house towards nightfall'  he used to say  'I played one of my most merry tunes and that generally procured me not only a lodging but subsistence for the next day but  in truth  '  his constant expression  'I must own whenever I attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank they always thought my performance odious and never made me any return for my endeavours to please them'  ON his arrival at Geneva he was recommended as a proper person for a travelling tutor to a young man who had been unexpectedly left a considerable sum of money by his uncle Mr S****** This youth who was articled to an attorney on receipt of his fortune determined to see the world and on his engaging with his preceptor made a proviso that he  should be permitted to govern himself and our traveller soon found his pupil understood the art of directing in money concerns extremely well as avarice was his prevailing passion  DURING Goldsmith's continuance in Switzerland he assiduously cultivated his poetical talent of which he had given some striking proofs at the college of Edinburgh It was from hence he sent the first sketch of his delightful epistle called the  Traveller  to his brother Henry a clergyman in Ireland  FROM Geneva Mr Goldsmith and his pupil proceeded to the south of France where the young man upon some disagreement with his preceptor paid him the small part of his salary which was due and embarked at Marseilles for England Our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large and passed through a number of difficulties in traversing the greatest part of France At length his curiosity being gratified he bent his course towards England and arrived at Dover the beginning of the winter in the year  HIS finances were so low on his return to England that he with difficulty got to the metropolis his whole stock of cash amounting to no more than a few halfpence An entire stranger in London his mind was filled with the most gloomy reflections in consequence of his embarrassed situation He applied to several apothecaries in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman but his broad Irish accent and the uncouthness of his appearance occasioned him to meet with insult from most of the medicinal tribe The next day however a chymist near Fishstreet  struck with his forlorn condition and the simplicity of his manner took him into his laboratory where he continued till he discovered that his old friend Dr Sleigh was in London That gentleman received him with the warmest affection and liberally invited him to share his purse till some establishment could be procured for him Goldsmith unwilling to be a burden to his friend a short time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him to assist the late Rev Dr Milner in instructing the young gentlemen at the Academy at Peckham and acquitted himself greatly to the Doctor's satisfaction for a short time but having obtained some reputation by the criticisms he had written in the Monthly Review Mr Griffith the principal proprietor engaged him in the compilation of it and resolving to pursue the profession of writing he returned to London as the mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward Here he determined to adopt a plan of the strictest oeconomy and at the close of the year took lodgings in GreenArbourcourt in the Old Bailey where he wrote several ingenious pieces The late Mr Newbery who at that time gave great encouragement to men of literary abilities became a kind of patron to our young author and introduced him as one of the writers in the Public Ledger in which his  Citizen of the World  originally appeared under the title of 'Chinese Letters'  During this time according to another account he wrote for the British Magazine of which Dr Smollet was then Editor most of those  Essays  and  Tales  which he afterwards collected and published in a separate volume He also wrote occasionally for the Critical Review and it was the merit which he discovered in criticising a despicable translation of Ovid's  Fasti  by a pedantic schoolmaster and his  Enquiry into the present state of learning in Europe  which first introduced him to the acquaintance of Dr Smollet who recommended him to several literati and to most of the booksellers by whom he was afterwards patronized  FORTUNE now seemed to take some notice of a man she had long neglected The simplicity of his character the integrity of his heart and the merit of his productions made his company very acceptable to a number of respectable persons and about the middle of the year he emerged from his mean apartments near the Old Bailey to the politer air of the Temple where he took handsome chambers and lived in a genteel style The publication of his  Traveller  his  Vicar of Wakefield  and his  History of England  was followed by the performance of his comedy of  the Good natured Man  at Covent Garden theatre and placed him in the first rank of the poets of the present age  OUR Doctor as he was now universally called had a constant levee of his distrest countrymen whose wants as far as he was able he always relieved and he has been often known to leave himself even without a guinea in order to supply the necessities of others  ANOTHER feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader Previous to the publication of his  Deserted Village  the bookseller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy which the Doctor mentioned a few hours after to one of his friends who observed it was a very great sum for so short a performance  'In truth'  replied Goldsmith  'I think so too it is much more than the honest man can afford or the piece is worth I have not been  easy since I received it I will therefore go back and return him his note'  which he actually did and left it entirely to the bookseller to pay him according to the profits produced by the sale of the poem which turned out very considerable  DURING the last rehearsal of his comedy intitled  She stoops to Conquer  which Mr Coleman thought would not succeed on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of Tony Lumpkin's speeches being apprehensive it might injure the play the Manager with great keenness replied  'Psha my dear Doctor do not be fearful of  squibs  when we have been sitting almost these two hours upon a  barrel of gunpowder  '  The piece however contrary to Mr Coleman's expectation was received with uncommon applause by the audience and Goldsmith's pride was so hurt by the severity of the above observation that it entirely put an end to his friendship for the gentleman who made it  NOTWITHSTANDING the great success of his pieces by some of which it is asserted upon good authority he cleared l in one year his circumstances were by no means in a prosperous situation partly owing to the liberality of his disposition and partly to an unfortunate habit he had contracted of gaming with the arts of which he was very little acquainted and consequently became the prey of those who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his ignorance  JUST before his death he had formed a design for executing an universal dictionary of arts and sciences  the  prospectus  of which he actually printed and distributed among his acquaintance In this work several of his literary friends particularly Sir Joshua Reynolds Dr Johnson Mr Beauclerc and Mr Garrick had promised to assist and to furnish him with articles upon different subjects He had entertained the most sanguine expectations from the success of it The undertaking however did not meet with that encouragement from the booksellers which he had imagined it would undoubtedly receive and he used to lament this circumstance almost to the last hour of his existence  HE had been for some years afflicted at different times with a violent strangury which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part of his life and which united with the vexations he suffered upon other occasions brought on a kind of habitual despondency In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever which being improperly treated terminated in his dissolution on the th day of April in the fortyfifth year of his age His friends who were very numerous and respectable had determined to bury him in Westminsterabbey where a tablet was to have been erected to his memory His pall was to have been supported by Lord Shelburne Lord Louth Sir Joshua Reynolds the Hon Mr Beauclerc Mr Edmond Burke and Mr Garrick but from some unaccountable circumstances this design was dropped and his remains were privately deposited in the Temple burialground  A subscription however has since been raised by his friends to defray the expence of a marble monument which is now executed by Mr Nollikens an eminent Statuary in London and is shortly to be placed in Westminsterabbey with the following inscription written by Dr Samuel Johnson  OLIVARII GOLDSMITH  POETAE PHYSICI HISTORICI  QUI NULLUM FERE SCRIBENDI GENUS  NON TETIGIT  NULLUM QUOD TETIGIT NON ORNAVIT  SIVE RISUS ESSENT MOVENDI  SIVE LACRIMAE  AFFECTUUM POTENS AT LENIS DOMINATOR  INGENIO SUBLIMIS

 LONDINI OBIIT MDCCLXXIV  AS to his character it is strongly illustrated by Mr Pope's line  'In wit a man simplicity a child'  THE learned leisure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by distresses which arose from the openness of his temper and which sometimes threw him into loud fits of passion but this impetuosity was corrected upon a moment's reflection and his servants have been known upon these occasions purposely to throw themselves in his way that they might profit by it immediately after for he who had the good fortune to be reproved was certain of being rewarded for it His disappointments at other times made him peevish and sullen and he has often left a party of convivial friends abruptly in the evening  in order to go home and brood over his misfortunes  THE universal esteem in which his poems are held and the repeated pleasure they give in the perusal are striking proofs of their merit He was a studious and correct observer of nature happy in the selection of his images in the choice of his subjects and in the harmony of his versification and though his embarrassed situation prevented him from putting the last hand to many of his productions his  Hermit  his  Traveller  and his  Deserted Village  bid fair to claim a place among the most finished pieces in the English language  AS different accounts have been given of this ingenious man the writer of  these  anecdotes cannot conclude without declaring that they are all founded upon facts and collected by one who lived with him upon the most friendly footing for a great number of years and who never felt any sorrow more sensibly than that which was occasioned by his death  ON THE DEATH OF DR GOLDSMITH  BY W WOTY  ADIEU sweet bard to each fine feeling true  Thy virtues many and thy foibles few  Those form'd to charm e'en vicious mindsand these  With harmless mirth the social soul to please  Another's woe thy heart could always melt  None gave more freefor none more deeply

POET LABERIUS A Roman Knight whom CAESAR forced upon the Stage  PRESERVED BY MACROBIUS  This translation was first printed in one of our Author's earliest works  the Present State of Learning in Europe  mo  WHAT no way left to shun th' inglorious stage  And save from infamy my sinking age  Scarce halfalive oppress'd with many a year  What in the name of dotage drives me here  A time there was when glory was my guide  Nor force nor fraud could turn my steps aside  Unaw'd by pow'r and unappal'd by fear  With honest thrift I held my honour dear  But this vile hour disperses all my store  And all my hoard of honour is no more  For ah too partial to my life's decline  Caesar persuades submission must be mine  Him I obey whom Heav'n itself obeys  Hopeless of pleasing yet inclin'd to please  Here then at once I welcome ev'ry shame  And cancel at threescore a life of fame  No more my titles shall my children tell  The old buffoon will fit my name as well  This day beyond its term my fate extends  For life is ended when our honour ends  THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION  A TALE  SECLUDED from domestic strife  Jack Bookworm led a college life  A fellowship at twenty five  Made him the happiest man alive  He drank his glass and crack'd his joke  And freshmen wonder'd as he spoke  SUCH pleasures unallay'd with care  Could any accident impair  Could Cupid's shaft at length transfix  Our swain arriv'd at thirtysix  O had the archer ne'er come down  To ravage in a country town  Or Flavia been content to stop  At triumphs in a Fleetstreet shop  O had her eyes forgot to blaze  Or Jack had wanted eyes to gaze  OBut let exclamation cease  Her presence banish'd all his peace  So with decorum all things carry'd  Miss frown'd and blush'd and then wasmarried  NEED we expose to vulgar sight  The raptures of the bridal night  Need we intrude on hallow'd ground  Or draw the curtains clos'd around  Let it suffice that each had charms  He clasp'd a goddess in his arms  And tho' she felt his usage rough  Yet in a man 'twas well enough  THE honeymoon like light'ning flew  The second brought its transports too  A third a fourth were not amiss  The fifth was friendship mix'd with bliss  But when a twelvemonth pass' away  Jack found his goddess made of clay  Found half the charms that deck'd her face  Arose from powder shreds or lace  But still the worst remain'd behind  That very face had robb'd her mind  SKILL'D in no other arts was she  But dressing patching repartee  And just as humour rose or fell  By turns a slattern or a belle  'Tis true she dress'd with modern grace  Half naked at a ball or race  But when at home at board or bed  Five greasy nightcaps wrap'd her head  Could so much beauty condescend  To be a dull domestic friend  Could any curtain lectures bring  To decency so fine a thing  In short by night 'twas fits or fretting  By day 'twas gadding or coquetting  Fond to be seen she kept a bevy  Of powder'd coxcombs at her levy  The 'squire and captain took their stations  And twenty other near relations  Jack suck'd his pipe and often broke  A sigh in suffocating smoke  While all their hours were pass'd between  Insulting repartee or spleen  THUS as her faults each day were known  He thinks her features coarser grown  He fancies ev'ry vice she shews  Or thins her lip or points her nose  Whenever rage or envy rise  How wide her mouth how wild her eyes  He knows not how but so it is  Her face is grown a knowing phyz  And tho' her fops are wond'rous civil  He thinks her ugly as the devil  NOW to perplex the ravell'd nooze  As each a different way pursues  While sullen or loquacious strife  Promis'd to hold them on for life  That dire disease whose ruthless power  Withers the beauty's transient flower  Lo the small pox whose horrid glare  Levell'd its terrors at the fair  And rifling ev'ry youthful grace  Left but the remnant of a face  THE glass grown hateful to her sight  Reflected now a perfect fright  Each former art she vainly tries  To bring back lustre to her eyes  In vain she tries her paste and creams  To smooth her skin or hide its seams  Her country beaux and city cousins  Lovers no more flew off by dozens  The squire himself was seen to yield  And ev'n the captain quit the field  POOR Madam now condemn'd to hack  The rest of life with anxious Jack  Perceiving others fairly flown  Attempted pleasing him alone  Jack soon was dazzled to behold  Her present face surpass the old  With modesty her cheeks are dy'd  Humility displaces pride  For taudry finery is seen  A person ever neatly clean  No more presuming on her sway  She learns good nature ev'ry day  Serenely gay and strict in duty  Jack finds his wife a perfect beauty  A NEW SIMILE IN THE MANNER OF SWIFT  LONG had I sought in vain to find  A likeness for the scribbling kind  The modern scribbling kind who write  In wit and sense and nature's spite  'Till reading I forget what day on  A chapter out of Took's Pantheon  I think I met with something there  To suit my purpose to a hair  But let us not proceed too furious  First please to turn to God Mercurius  You'll find him pictur'd at full length  In book the second page the tenth  The stress of all my proofs on him I lay  And now proceed we to our simile  IMPRIMIS pray observe his hat  Wings upon either sidemark that  Well what is it from thence we gather  Why these denote a brain of feather  A brain of feather very right  With wit that's flighty learning light  Such as to modern bard's decreed  A just comparisonproceed  IN the next place his feet peruse  Wings grow again from both his shoes  Design'd no doubt their part to bear  And waft his godship through the air  And here my simile unites  For in a modern poet's flights  I'm sure it may be justly said  His feet are useful as his head  LASTLY vouchsafe t'observe his hand  Fill'd with a snakeincircled wand  By classick authors term'd caduceus  And highly fam'd for several uses  To witmost wond'rously endu'd  No poppy water half so good  For let folks only get a touch  Its soporific virtue's such  Tho' ne'er so much awake before  That quickly they begin to snore  Add too what certain writers tell  With this he drives mens souls to hell  NOW to apply begin we then  His wand's a modern author's pen  The serpents round about it twin'd  Denote him of the reptile kind  Denote the rage with which he writes  His frothy slaver venom'd bites  An equal semblance still to keep  Alike too both conduce to sleep  This diff'rence only as the God  Drove souls to Tart'rus with his rod  With his goosequill the scribbling elf  Instead of others damns himself  AND here my simile almost tript  Yet grant a word by way of postscript  Moreover Merc'ry had a failing  Well what of that out with itstealing  In which all modern bards agree  Being each as great a thief as he  But ev'n this deity's existence  Shall lend my simile assistance  Our modern bards why what a pox  Are they but senseless stones and blocks  A DESCRIPTION OF AN AUTHOR'S BEDCHAMBER  WHERE the Red Lion staring o'er the way  Invites each passing stranger that can pay  Where Calvert's butt and Parson's black champaign  Regale the drabs and bloods of Drurylane  There in a lonely room from bailiffs snug  The Muse found Scroggen stretch'd beneath a rug  A window patch'd with paper lent a ray  That dimly shew'd the state in which he lay  The sanded floor that grits beneath the tread  The humid wall with paltry pictures spread  The royal game of goose was there in view  And the twelve rules the royal martyr drew  The seasons fram'd with listing found a place  And brave prince William shew'd his lampblack face  The morn was cold he views with keen desire  The rusty grate unconscious of a fire  With beer and milk arrears the frieze was scor'd  And five crack'd tea cups dress'd the chimney board  A nightcap deck'd his brows instead of bay  A cap by nighta stocking all the day  THE HERMIT A BALLAD  FIRST PRINTED IN MDCCLXV  THE FOLLOWING LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE PRINTER OF THE ST JAMES'S CHRONICLE Appeared in that Paper in JUNE  SIR  AS there is nothing I dislike so much as newspaper controversy particularly upon trifles permit me to be as concise as possible in informing a correspondent of yours that I recommended Blainville's Travels because I thought the book was a good one and I think so still I said I was told by the bookseller that it was then first published but in that it seems I was misinformed and my reading was not extensive enough to set me right  Another correspondent of yours accuses me of having taken a ballad I published some time ago from one  The Friar of Orders Gray  Reliq of Anc Poetry  vol p  by the ingenious Mr Percy I do not think there is any great resemblance between the two pieces  in question If there be any his ballad is taken from mine I read it to Mr Percy some years ago and he as we both considered these things as trifles at best told me with his usual good humour the next time I saw him that he had taken my plan to form the fragments of Shakespeare into a ballad of his own He then read me his little Cento if I may so call it and I highly approved it Such petty anecdotes as these are scarce worth printing and were it not for the busy disposition of some of your correspondents the public should never have known that he owes me the hint of his ballad or that I am obliged to his friendship and learning for communications of a much more important nature  I am SIR Yours c OLIVER GOLDSMITH  THE HERMIT  A BALLAD  "TURN gentle hermit of the dale  "And guide my lonely way  "To where yon taper cheers the vale  "With hospitable ray  "For here forlorn and lost I tread  "With fainting steps and slow  "Where wilds immeasurably spread  "Seem length'ning as I go"  "Forbear my son" the hermit cries  "To tempt the dang'rous gloom  "For yonder faithless phantom flies  "To lure thee to thy doom  "Here to the houseless child of want  "My door is open still  "And tho' my portion is but scant  "I give it with good will  "Then turn tonight and freely share  "Whate'er my cell bestows  "My rushy couch and frugal fare  "My blessing and repose  "No flocks that range the valley free  "To slaughter I condemn  "Taught by that power that pities me  "I learn to pity them  "But from the mountain's grassy side  "A guiltless feast I bring  "A scrip with herbs and fruits supply'd  "And water from the spring  "Then pilgrim turn thy cares forego  "All earthborn cares are wrong  "Man wants but little here below  "Nor wants that little long"  Soft as the dew from heav'n descends  His gentle accents fell  The modest stranger lowly bends  And follows to the cell  Far in a wilderness obscure  The lonely mansion lay  A refuge to the neighb'ring poor  And strangers led astray  No stores beneath its humble thatch  Requir'd a master's care  The wicket op'ning with a latch  Receiv'd the harmless pair  And now when busy crowds retire  To take their evening rest  The hermit trimm'd his little fire  And cheer'd his pensive guest  And spread his vegetable store  And gayly prest and smil'd  And skill'd in legendary lore  The ling'ring hours beguil'd  Around in sympathetic mirth  Its tricks the kitten tries  The cricket chirrups in the hearth  The crackling faggot flies  But nothing could a charm impart  To sooth the stranger's woe  For grief was heavy at his heart  And tears began to flow  His rising cares the hermit spy'd  With answ'ring care opprest  "And whence unhappy youth" he cry'd  "The sorrows of thy breast  "From better habitations spurn'd  "Reluctant dost thou rove  "Or grieve for friendship unreturn'd  "Or unregarded love  "Alas the joys that fortune brings  "Are trifling and decay  "And those who prize the paltry things  "More trifling still than they  "And what is friendship but a name  "A charm that lulls to sleep  "A shade that follows wealth or fame  "And leaves the wretch to weep  "And love is still an emptier sound  "The modern fair one's jest  "On earth unseen or only found  "To warm the turtle's nest  "For shame fond youth thy sorrows hush  "And spurn the sex" he said  But while he spoke a rising blush  His lovelorn guest betray'd  Surpriz'd he sees new beauties rise  Swift mantling to the view  Like colours o'er the morning skies  As bright as transient too  The bashful look the rising breast  Alternate spread alarms  The lovely stranger stands confest  A maid in all her charms  "And ah forgive a stranger rude  "A wretch forlorn" she cry'd  "Whose feet unhallow'd thus intrude  "Where heav'n and you reside  "But let a maid thy pity share  "Whom love has taught to stray  "Who seeks for rest but finds despair  "Companion of her way  "My father liv'd beside the Tyne  "A wealthy lord was he  "And all his wealth was mark'd as mine  "He had but only me  "To win me from his tender arms  "Unnumber'd suitors came  "Who prais'd me for imputed charms  "And selt or feign'd a flame  "Each hour a mercenary croud  "With richest proffers strove  "Among the rest young Edwin bow'd  "But never talk'd of love  "In humble simplest habit clad  "No wealth or pow'r had he  "Wisdom and worth were all he had  "But these were all to me  "The blossom op'ning to the day  "The dews of heav'n refin'd  "Could nought of purity display  "To emulate his mind  "The dew the blossoms of the tree  "With charms inconstant shine  "Their charms were his but wo to me  "Their constancy was mine  "For still I try'd each fickle art  "Importunate and vain  "And while his passion touch'd my heart  "I triumph'd in his pain  "'Till quite dejected with my scorn  "He left me to my pride  "And sought a solitude forlorn  "In secret where he dy'd  "But mine the sorrow mine the fault  "And well my life shall pay  "I'll seek the solitude he sought  "And stretch me where he lay  "And there forlorn despairing hid  "I'll lay me down and die  "'Twas so for me that Edwin did  "And so for him will I"  "Forbid it Heav'n" the hermit cry'd  And clasp'd her to his breast  The wond'ring fair one turn'd to chide  'Twas Edwin's self that prest  "Turn Angelina ever dear  "My charmer turn to see  "Thy own thy longlost Edwin here  "Restor'd to love and thee  "Thus let me hold thee to my heart  "And ev'ry care resign  "And shall we never never part  "My lifemy all that's mine  "No never from this hour to part  "We'll live and love so true  "The sigh that rends thy constant heart  "Shall break thy Edwin's too"  AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF A MAD DOG  GOOD people all of ev'ry sort  Give ear unto my song  And if you find it wond'rous short  It cannot hold you long  In Islington there was a man  Of whom the world might say  That still a godly race he ran  Whene'er he went to pray  A kind and gentle heart he had  To comfort friends and foes  The naked ev'ry day he clad  When he put on his cloaths  And in that town a dog was found  As many dogs there be  Both mungrel puppy whelp and hound  And curs of low degree  This dog and man at first were friends  But when a pique began  The dog to gain his private ends  Went mad and bit the man  Around from all the neighb'ring streets  The wond'ring neighbours ran  And swore the dog had lost his wits  To bite so good a man  The wound it seem'd both sore and sad  To ev'ry christian eye  And while they swore the dog was mad  They swore the man would die  But soon a wonder came to light  That shew'd the rogues they ly'd  The man recover'd of the bite  The dog it was that dy'd  STANZAS ON WOMAN  WHEN lovely woman stoops to folly  And finds too late that men betray  What charm can sooth her melancholy  What art can wash her guilt away  The only art her guilt to cover  To hide her shame from ev'ry eye  To give repentance to her lover  And wring his bosomis to die  THE TRAVELLER OR A PROSPECT OF SOCIETY A POEM  FIRST PRINTED IN MDCCLXV  TO THE REV HENRY GOLDSMITH  DEAR SIR  I AM sensible that the friendship between us can acquire no new force from the ceremonies of a Dedication and perhaps it demands an excuse thus to prefix your name to my attempts which you decline giving with your own But as a part of this Poem was formerly written to you from Switzerland the whole can now with propriety be only inscribed to you It will also throw a light upon many parts of it when the reader understands that it is addressed to a man who despising Fame and Fortune has retired early to Happiness and Obscurity with an income of forty pounds a year  I now perceive my dear brother the wisdom of your humble choice You have entered upon a sacred office where the harvest is great and the labourers are but few while you have left the field of Ambition where the labourers are many and the harvest not worth carrying away But of all kinds of ambition what from the refinement of the times from different systems of criticism and from the  divisions of party that which pursues poetical fame is the wildest  Poetry makes a principal amusement among unpolished nations but in a country verging to the extremes of refinement Painting and Music come in for a share As these offer the feeble mind a less laborious entertainment they at first rival Poetry and at length supplant her they engross all that favour once shewn to her and though but younger sisters seize upon the elder's birthright  Yet however this art may be neglected by the powerful it is still in greater danger from the mistaken efforts of the learned to improve it What criticisms have we not heard of late in favour of blank verse and Pindaric odes chorusses anapests and iambics alliterative care and happy negligence Every absurdity has now a champion to defend it and as he is generally much in the wrong so he has always much to say for error is ever talkative  But there is an enemy to this art still more dangerous I mean Party Party entirely distorts the judgment and destroys the taste When the mind is once infected with this disease it can only find pleasure in what contributes to increase the distemper Like the tyger that seldom desists from pursuing man after having once preyed upon human flesh the reader who has once gratified his appetite with calumny makes ever after the most agreeable feast upon murdered reputation Such readers generally admire some halfwitted thing who wants to be thought a bold man having lost the character of a wise one Him they dignify with the name of poet his tawdry  lampoons are called satires his turbulence is said to be force and his phrenzy fire  What reception a Poem may find which has neither abuse party nor blank verse to support it I cannot tell nor am I solicitous to know My aims are right Without espousing the cause of any party I have attempted to moderate the rage of all I have endeavoured to shew that there may be equal happiness in states that are differently governed from our own that every state has a particular principle of happiness and that this principle in each may be carried to a mischievous excess There are few can judge better than yourself how far these positions are illustrated in this Poem I am  DEAR SIR  YOUR MOST AFFECTIONATE BROTHER OLIVER GOLDSMITH  THE TRAVELLER OR A PROSPECT OF SOCIETY  In this poem several alterations were made and some new verses added as it passed through different editionsWe have printed from the ninth which was the last edition published in the lifetime of the author  REMOTE unfriended melancholy slow  Or by the lazy Scheld or wand'ring Po  Or onward where the rude Carinthian boor  Against the houseless stranger shuts the door  Or where Campania's plain forsaken lies  A weary waste expanding to the skies  Where'er I roam whatever realms to see  My heart untravell'd fondly turns to thee  Still to my brother turns with ceaseless pain  And drags at each remove a length'ning chain  Eternal blessings crown my earliest friend  And round his dwelling guardian saints attend  Blest be that spot where chearful guests retire  To pause from toil and trim their ev'ning fire  Blest that abode where want and pain repair  And ev'ry stranger finds a ready chair  Blest be those feasts with simple plenty crown'd  Where all the ruddy family around  Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail  Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale  Or press the bashful stranger to his food  And learn the luxury of doing good  But me not destin'd such delights to share  My prime of life in wand'ring spent and care  Impell'd with steps unceasing to pursue  Some fleeting good that mocks me with the view  That like the circle bounding earth and skies  Allures from far yet as I follow flies  My fortune leads to traverse realms alone  And find no spot of all the world my own  Ev'n now where Alpine solitudes ascend  I sit me down a pensive hour to spend  And plac'd on high above the storm's career  Look downward where an hundred realms appear  Lakes forests cities plains extending wide  The pomp of kings the shepherd's humbler pride  When thus Creation's charms around combine  Amidst the store should thankless pride repine  Say should the philosophic mind disdain  That good which makes each humbler bosom vain  Let schooltaught pride dissemble all it can  These little things are great to little man  And wiser he whose sympathetic mind  Exults in all the good of all mankind  Ye glitt'ring towns with wealth and splendor crown'd  Ye fields where summer spreads profusion round  Ye lakes whose vessels catch the busy gale  Ye bending swains that dress the flow'ry vale  For me your tributary stores combine  Creation's heir the world the world is mine  As some lone miser visiting his store  Bends at his treasure counts recounts it o'er  Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill  Yet still he sighs for hoards are wanting still  Thus to my breast alternates passions rise  Pleas'd with each good that heav'n to man supplies  Yet oft a sigh prevails and sorrows fall  To see the hoard of human bliss so small  And oft I wish amidst the scene to find  Some spot to real happiness consign'd  Where my worn soul each wand'ring hope at rest  May gather bliss to see my fellows blest  But where to find that happiest spot below  Who can direct when all pretend to know  The shudd'ring tenant of the frigid zone  Boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own  Extols the treasures of his stormy seas  And his long nights of revelry and ease  The naked negro panting at the line  Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine  Basks in the glare or stems the tepid wave  And thanks his Gods for all the good they gave  Such is the patriot's boast where'er we roam  His first best country ever is at home  And yet perhaps if countries we compare  And estimate the blessings which they share  Tho' patriots flatter still shall wisdom find  An equal portion dealt to all mankind  As different good by art or nature given  To different nations makes their blessings even  Nature a mother kind alike to all  Still grants her bliss at labour's earnest call  With food as well the peasant is supply'd  On Idra's cliffs as Arno's shelvy side  And though the rocky crested summits frown  These rocks by custom turn to beds of down  From art more various are the blessings sent  Wealth commerce honour liberty content  Yet these each other's pow'r so strong contest  That either seems destructive of the rest  Where wealth and freedom reign contentment fails  And honour sinks where commerce long prevails  Hence ev'ry state to one lov'd blessing prone  Conforms and models life to that alone  Each to the fav'rite happiness attends  And spurns the plan that aims at other ends  'Till carried to excess in each domain  This fav'rite good begets peculiar pain  But let us try these truths with closer eyes  And trace them through the prospect as it lies  Here for a while my proper cares resign'd  Here let me sit in sorrow for mankind  Like yon neglected shrub at random cast  That shades the steep and sighs at ev'ry blast  Far to the right where Appennine ascends  Bright as the summer Italy extends  Its uplands sloping deck the mountain's side  Woods over woods in gay theatric pride  While oft some temple's mould'ring tops between  With venerable grandeur mark the scene  Could nature's bounty satisfy the breast  The sons of Italy were surely blest  Whatever fruits in different climes were found  That proudly rise or humbly court the ground  Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear  Whose bright succession decks the varied year  Whatever sweets salute the northern sky  With vernal lives that blossom but to die  These here disporting own the kindred soil  Nor ask luxuriance from the planter's toil  While seaborn gales their gelid wings expand  To winnow fragrance round the smiling land  But small the bliss that sense alone bestows  And sensual bliss is all the nation knows  In florid beauty groves and fields appear  Man seems the only growth that dwindles here  Contrasted faults through all his manners reign  Though poor luxurious though submissive vain  Though grave yet trifling zealous yet untrue  And ev'n in penance planning sins anew  All evils here contaminate the mind  That opulence departed leaves behind  For wealth was theirs not far remov'd the date  When commerce proudly flourish'd through the state  At her command the palace learnt to rise  Again the longfall'n column sought the skies  The canvass glow'd beyond e'en Nature warm  The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form  Till more unsteady than the southern gale  Commerce on other shores display'd her sail  While naught remain'd of all that riches gave  But towns unmann'd and lords without a slave  And late the nation found with fruitless skill  Its former strength was but plethoric ill  Yet still the loss of wealth is here supplied  By arts the splendid wrecks of former pride  From these the feeble heart and longfall'n mind  An easy compensation seem to find  Here may be seen in bloodless pomp array'd  The pasteboard triumph and the cavalcade  Processions form'd for piety and love  A mistress or a saint in ev'ry grove  By sports like these are all their cares beguil'd  The sports of children satisfy the child  Each nobler aim represt by long controul  Now sinks at last or feebly mans the soul  While low delights succeeding fast behind  In happier meanness occupy the mind  As in those domes where Caesars once bore sway  Defac'd by time and tott'ring in decay  There in the ruin heedless of the dead  The shelterseeking peasant builds his shed  And wond'ring man could want the larger pile  Exults and owns his cottage with a smile  My soul turn from them turn we to survey  Where rougher climes a nobler race display  Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread  And force a churlish soil for scanty bread  No product here the barren hills afford  But man and steel the soldier and his sword  No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array  But winter ling'ring chills the lap of May  No zephyr fondly sues the mountain's breast  But meteors glare and stormy glooms invest  Yet still ev'n here content can spread a charm  Redress the clime and all its rage disarm  Though poor the peasant's hut his feasts though small  He sees his little lot the lot of all  Sees no contiguous palace rear its head  To shame the meanness of his humble shed  No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal  To make him loath his vegetable meal  But calm and bred in ignorance and toil  Each wish contracting fits him to the soil  Chearful at morn he wakes from short repose  Breasts the keen air and carols as he goes  With patient angle trolls the finny deep  Or drives his vent'rous ploughshare to the steep  Or seeks the den where snowtracks mark the way  And drags the struggling savage into day  At night returning ev'ry labour sped  He sits him down the monarch of a shed  Smiles by his chearful fire and round surveys  His childrens looks that brighten at the blaze  While his lov'd partner boastful of her hoard  Displays her cleanly platter on the board  And haply too some pilgrim thither led  With many a tale repays the nightly bed  Thus every good his native wilds impart  Imprints the patriot passion on his heart  And ev'n those ills that round his mansion rise  Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies  Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms  And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms  And as a child when scaring sounds molest  Clings close and closer to the mother's breast  So the loud torrent and the whirlwind's roar  But bind him to his native mountains more  Such are the charms to barren states assign'd  Their wants but few their wishes all confin'd  Yet let them only share the praises due  If few their wants their pleasures are but few  For ev'ry want that stimulates the breast  Becomes a source of pleasure when redrest  Whence from such lands each pleasing science flies  That first excites desire and then supplies  Unknown to them when sensual pleasures cloy  To fill the languid pause with finer joy  Unknown those pow'rs that raise the soul to flame  Catch ev'ry nerve and vibrate through the frame  Their level life is but a mould'ring fire  Unquench'd by want unfann'd by strong desire  Unfit for raptures or if raptures cheer  On some high festival of once a year  In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire  Till buried in debauch the bliss expires  But not their joys alone thus coarsely flow  Their morals like their pleasures are but low  For as refinement stops from sire to son  Unalter'd unimprov'd the manners run  And love's and friendship's finely pointed dart  Fall blunted from each indurated heart  Some sterner virtues o'er the mountain's breast  May sit like falcons cow'ring on the nest  But all the gentler morals such as play  Through life's more cultur'd walks and charm the way  These far dispers'd on tim'rous pinions fly  To sport and flutter in a kinder sky  To kinder skies where gentler manners reign  I turn and France displays her bright domain  Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease  Pleas'd with thyself whom all the world can please  How often have I led thy sportive choir  With tuneless pipe beside the murmuring Loire  Where shading elms along the margin grew  And freshen'd from the wave the zephyr flew  And haply though my harsh touch falt'ring still  But mock'd all tune and marr'd the dancer's skill  Yet would the village praise my wond'rous pow'r  And dance forgetful of the noontide hour  Alike all ages Dames of ancient days  Have led their children through the mirthful maze  And the gay grandsire skill'd in gestic lore  Has frisk'd beneath the burthen of threescore  So blest a life these thoughtless realms display  Thus idly busy rolls their world away  Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear  For honour forms the social temper here  Honour that praise which real merit gains  Or ev'n imaginary worth obtains  Here passes current paid from hand to hand  It shifts in splendid traffic round the land  From courts to camps to cottages it strays  And all are taught an avarice of praise  They please are pleas'd they give to get esteem  Till seeming blest they grow to what they seem  But while this softer art their bliss supplies  It gives their follies also room to rise  For praise too dearly lov'd or warmly sought  Enfeebles all internal strength of thought  And the weak soul within itself unblest  Leans for all pleasure on another's breast  Hence ostentation here with tawdry art  Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart  Here vanity assumes her pert grimace  And trims her robes of frize with copper lace  Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer  To boast one splendid banquet once a year  The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws  Nor weigh the solid worth of self applause  To men of other minds my fancy flies  Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies  Methinks her patient sons before me stand  Where the broad ocean leans against the land  And sedulous to stop the coming tide  Lift the tall rampire's artificial pride  Onward methinks and diligently slow  The firm connected bulwark seems to grow  Spreads its long arms amidst the wat'ry roar  Scoops out an empire and usurps the shore  While the pent ocean rising o'er the pile  Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile  The slow canal the yellow blossom'd vale  The willow tufted bank the gliding sail  The crouded mart the cultivated plain  A new creation rescu'd from his reign  Thus while around the wavesubjected soil  Impels the native to repeated toil  Industrious habits in each bosom reign  And industry begets a love of gain  Hence all the good from opulence that springs  With all those ills superfluous treasure brings  Are here display'd Their muchlov'd wealth imparts  Convenience plenty elegance and arts  But view them closer craft and fraud appear  Ev'n liberty itself is barter'd here  At gold's superior charms all freedom flies  The needy sell it and the rich man buys  A land of tyrants and a den of slaves  Here wretches seek dishonourable graves  And calmly bent to servitude conform  Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm  Heav'ns how unlike their Belgic sires of old  Rough poor content ungovernably bold  War in each breast and freedom on each brow  How much unlike the sons of Britain now  Fir'd at the sound my genius spreads her wing  And flies where Britain courts the western spring  Where lawns extend that scorn Arcadian pride  And brighter streams than fam'd Hydaspis glide  There all around the gentlest breezes stray  There gentle music melts on ev'ry spray  Creation's mildest charms are there combin'd  Extremes are only in the master's mind  Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state  With daring aims irregularly great  Pride in their port defiance in their eye  I see the lords of human kind pass by  Intent on high designs a thoughtful band  By forms unfashion'd fresh from Nature's hand  Fierce in their native hardiness of soul  True to imagin'd right above controul  While ev'n the peasant boasts these rights to scan  And learns to venerate himself as man  Thine Freedom thine the blessings pictur'd here  Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear  Too blest indeed were such without alloy  But foster'd ev'n by Freedom ills annoy  That independence Britons prize too high  Keeps man from man and breaks the social tie  The selfdependent lordlings stand alone  All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown  Here by the bonds of nature feebly held  Minds combat minds repelling and repell'd  Ferments arise imprison'd factions roar  Represt ambition struggles round her shore  Till overwrought the gen'ral system feels  Its motions stop or phrenzy fire the wheels  Nor this the worst As nature's ties decay  As duty love and honour fail to sway  Fictitious bonds the bonds of wealth and law  Still gather strength and force unwilling awe  Hence all obedience bows to these alone  And talent sinks and merit weeps unknown  Till time may come when stript of all her charms  The land of scholars and the nurse of arms  Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame  Where kings have toil'd and poets wrote for fame  One sink of level avarice shall lie  And scholars soldiers kings unhonour'd die  Yet think not thus when Freedom's ills I state  I mean to flatter kings or court the great  Ye pow'rs of truth that bid my soul aspire  Far from my bosom drive the low desire  And thou fair Freedom taught alike to feel  The rabble's rage and tyrant's angry steel  Thou transitory flow'r alike undone  By proud contempt or favour's fost'ring sun  Still may thy blooms the changeful clime endure  I only would repress them to secure  For just experience tells in ev'ry soil  That those who think must govern those that toil  And all that freedom's highest aims can reach  Is but to lay proportion'd loads on each  Hence should one order disproportion'd grow  Its double weight must ruin all below  O then how blind to all that truth requires  Who think it freedom when a part aspires  Calm is my soul nor apt to rise in arms  Except when fast approaching danger warms  But when contending chiefs blockade the throne  Contracting regal pow'r to stretch their own  When I behold a factious band agree  To call it freedom when themselves are free  Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw  Laws grind the poor and rich men rule the law  The wealth of climes where savage nations roam  Pillag'd from slaves to purchase slaves at home  Fear pity justice indignation start  Tear off reserve and bear my swelling heart  Till half a patriot half a coward grown  I fly from petty tyrants to the throne  Yes brother curse with me that baleful hour  When first ambition struck at regal pow'r  And thus polluting honour in its source  Gave wealth to sway the mind with double force  Have we not seen round Britain's peopled shore  Her useful sons exchang'd for useless ore  Seen all her triumphs but destruction haste  Like flaring tapers bright'ning as they waste  Seen opulence her grandeur to maintain  Lead stern depopulation in her train  And over fields where scatter'd hamlets rose  In barren solitary pomp repose  Have we not seen at pleasure's lordly call  The smiling longfrequented village fall  Beheld the duteous son the sire decay'd  The modest matron and the blushing maid  Forc'd from their homes a melancholy train  To traverse climes beyond the western main  Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around  And Niagara stuns with thund'ring sound  Ev'n now perhaps as there some pilgrim strays  Through tangled forests and through dang'rous ways  Where beasts with man divided empire claim  And the brown Indian marks with murd'rous aim  There while above the giddy tempest flies  And all around distressful yells arise  The pensive exile bending with his wo  To stop too fearful and too faint to go  Casts a long look where England's glories shine  And bids his bosom sympathize with mine  Vain very vain my weary search to find  That bliss which only centers in the mind  Why have I stray'd from pleasure and repose  To seek a good each government bestows  In ev'ry government though terrors reign  Though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain  How small of all that human hearts endure  That part which laws or kings can cause or cure  Still to ourselves in ev'ry place consign'd  Our own felicity we make or find  With secret course which no loud storms annoy  Glides the smooth current of domestic joy  The lifted ax the agonizing wheel  Luke's iron crown and Damien's bed of steel  To men remote from pow'r but rarely known  Leave reason faith and conscience all our own  THE DESERTED VILLAGE A POEM  FIRST PRINTED IN MDCCLXIX  TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS  DEAR SIR  I CAN have no expectations in an address of this kind either to add to your reputation or to establish my own You can gain nothing from my admiration as I am ignorant of that art in which you are said to excel and I may lose much by the severity of your judgment as few have a juster taste in poetry than you Setting interest therefore aside to which I never paid much attention I must be indulged at present in following my affections The only dedication I ever made was to my brother because I loved him better than most other men He is since dead Permit me to inscribe this poem to you  How far you may be pleased with the versification and meer mechanical parts of this attempt I don't pretend to inquire but I know you will object and indeed several of our best and wisest friends concur in the opinion that the depopulation it deplores is no where to be seen and the disorders it laments are only to be found in the poet's own imagination To this I can scarce make any other answer than that I sincerely believe what I have written that I have taken all possible pains in my country excursions for  these four or five years past to be certain of what I allege and that all my views and inquiries have led me to believe those miseries real which I here attempt to display But this is not the place to enter into an inquiry whether the country be depopulating or not the discussion would take up much room and I should prove myself at best an indifferent politician to tire the reader with a long preface when I want his unfatigued attention to a long poem  In regretting the depopulation of the country I inveigh against the increase of our luxuries and here also I expect the shout of modern politicians against me For twenty or thirty years past it has been the fashion to consider luxury as one of the greatest national advantages and all the wisdom of antiquity in that particular as erroneous Still however I must remain a professed ancient on that head and continue to think those luxuries prejudicial to states by which so many vices are introduced and so many kingdoms have been undone Indeed so much has been poured out of late on the other side of the question that meerly for the sake of novelty and variety one would sometimes wish to be in the right I am  DEAR SIR  YOUR SINCERE FRIEND AND ARDENT ADMIRER OLIVER GOLDSMITH  THE DESERTED VILLAGE  SWEET AUBURN loveliest village of the plain  Where health and plenty chear'd the lab'ring swain  Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid  And parting summer's ling'ring blooms delay'd  Dear lovely bow'rs of innocence and ease  Seats of my youth when ev'ry sport could please  How often have I loiter'd o'er thy green  Where humble happiness endear'd each scene  How often have I paus'd on ev'ry charm  The shelter'd cot the cultivated farm  The neverfailing brook the busy mill  The decent church that topt the neighb'ring hill  The hawthorn bush with feats beneath the shade  For talking age and whisp'ring lovers made  How often have I blest the coming day  When toil remitting lent its turn to play  And all the village train from labour free  Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree  While many a pastime circled in the shade  The young contending as the old survey'd  And many a gambol frolic'd o'er the ground  And slights of art and feats of strength went round  And still as each repeated pleasure tir'd  Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspir'd  The dancing pair that simply sought renown  By holding out to tire each other down  The swain mistrustless of his smutted face  While secret laughter titter'd round the place  The bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love  The matron's glance that would those looks reprove  These were thy charms sweet village sports like these  With sweet succession taught ev'n toil to please  These round thy bow'rs their chearful influence shed  These were thy charmsBut all these charms are fled  Sweet smiling village loveliest of the lawn  Thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn  Amidst thy bow'rs the tyrant's hand is seen  And desolation saddens all thy green  One only master grasps the whole domain  And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain  No more thy glassy brook reflects the day  But choak'd with sedges works its weedy way  Along thy glades a solitary guest  The hollow sounding bittern guards its nest  Amidst thy desart walks the lapwing flies  And tires their echoes with unvary'd cries  Sunk are thy bow'rs in shapeless ruin all  And the long grass o'ertops the mould'ring wall  And trembling shrinking from the spoiler's hand  Far far away thy children leave the land  Ill fares the land to hast'ning ills a prey  Where wealth accumulates and men decay  Princes and lords may flourish or may fade  A breath can make them as a breath has made  But a bold peasantry their country's pride  When once destroy'd can never be supply'd  A time there was ere England's griefs began  When ev'ry rood of ground maintain'd its man  For him light labour spread her wholesome store  Just gave what life requir'd but gave no more  His best companions innocence and health  And his best riches ignorance of wealth  But times are alter'd trade's unfeeling train  Usurp the land and dispossess the swain  Along the lawn where scatter'd hamlets rose  Unwieldy wealth and cumb'rous pomp repose  And ev'ry want to luxury ally'd  And ev'ry pang that folly pays to pride  These gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom  Those calm desires that ask'd but little room  Those healthful sports that grac'd the peaceful scene  Liv'd in each look and brighten'd all the green  These far departing seek a kinder shore  And rural mirth and manners are no more  Sweet AUBURN parent of the blissful hour  Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's pow'r  Here as I take my solitary rounds  Amidst thy tangling walks and ruin'd grounds  And many a year elaps'd return to view  Where once the cottage stood the hawthorn grew  Remembrance wakes with all her busy train  Swells at my breast and turns the past to pain  In all my wand'rings round this world of care  In all my griefsand GOD has giv'n my share  I still had hopes my latest hours to crown  Amidst these humble bow'rs to lay me down  To husband out life's taper at the close  And keep the flame from wasting by repose  I still had hopes for pride attends us still  Amidst the swains to shew my booklearn'd skill  Around my fire an ev'ning group to draw  And tell of all I felt and all I saw  And as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue  Pants to the place from whence at first he flew  I still had hopes my long vexations past  Here to returnand die at home at last  O blest retirement friend to life's decline  Retreats from care that never must be mine  How blest is he who crowns in shades like these  A youth of labour with an age of ease  Who quits a world where strong temptations try  And since 'tis hard to combat learns to fly  For him no wretches born to work and weep  Explore the mine or tempt the dang'rous deep  No surly porter stands in guilty state  To spurn imploring famine from the gate  But on he moves to meet his latter end  Angels around befriending virtue's friend  Sinks to the grave with unperceiv'd decay  While resignation gently slopes the way  And all his prospects bright'ning to the last  His Heav'n com mences ere theworld be past  Sweet was the sound when oft at ev'ning's close  Up yonder hill the village murmur rose  There as I past with careless steps and slow  The mingling notes came soften'd from below  The swain responsive as the milkmaid sung  The sober herd that low'd to meet their young  The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool  The playful children just let loose from school  The watchdog's voice that bay'd the whisp'ring wind  And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind  These all in sweet confusion sought the shade  And fill'd each pause the nightingale had made  For now the sounds of population fail  No chearful murmurs fluctuate in the gale  No busy steps the grassgrown footway tread  But all the bloomy flush of life is sled  All but yon widow'd solitary thing  That feebly bends beside the plashy spring  She wretched matron forc'd in age for bread  To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread  To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn  To seek her nightly shed and weep till morn  She only left of all the harmless train  The sad historian of the pensive plain  Near yonder copse where once the garden smil'd  And still where many a garden flow'r grows wild  There where a few torn shrubs the place disclose  The village preacher's modest mansion rose  A man he was to all the country dear  And passing rich with forty pounds a year  Remote from towns he ran his godly race  Nor ere had chang'd nor wish'd to change his place  Unskilful he to fawn or seek for pow'r  By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour  Far other aims his heart had learn'd to prize  More bent to raise the wretched than to rise  His house was known to all the vagrant train  He chid their wand'rings but reliev'd their pain  The longremember'd beggar was his guest  Whose beard descending swept his aged breast  The ruin'd spendthrift now no longer proud  Claim'd kindred there and had his claims allow'd  The broken soldier kindly bade to stay  Sate by his fire and talk'd the night away  Wept o'er his wounds or tales of sorrow done  Shoulder'd his crutch and shew'd how fields were won  Pleas'd with his guests the good man learn'd to glow  And quite forgot their vices in their wo  Careless their merits or their faults to scan  His pity gave ere charity began  Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride  And ev'n his failings lean'd to Virtue's side  But in his duty prompt at ev'ry call  He watch'd and wept he pray'd and felt for all  And as a bird each fond endearment tries  To tempt its newfledg'd offspring to the skies  He tried each art reprov'd each dull delay  Allur'd to brighter worlds and led the way  Beside the bed where parting life was lay'd  And sorrow guilt and pain by turns dismay'd  The rev'rend champion stood At his control  Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul  Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise  And his last fault'ring accents whisper'd praise  At church with meek and unaffected grace  His looks adorn'd the venerable place  Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway  And fools who came to scoff remain'd to pray  The service past around the pious man  With ready zeal each honest rustic ran  Ev'n children follow'd with endearing wile  And pluck'd his gown to share the good man's smile  His ready smile a parent's warmth exprest  Their welfare pleas'd him and their cares distrest  To them his heart his love his griefs were giv'n  But all his serious thoughts had rest in heav'n  As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form  Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm  Tho' round its breast the rolling clouds are spread  Eternal sunshine settles on its head  Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way  With blossom'd furze unprofitably gay  There in his noisy mansion skill'd to rule  The village master taught his little school  A man severe he was and stern to view  I knew him well and ev'ry truant knew  Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace  The day's disasters in his morning face  Full well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee  At all his jokes for many a joke had he  Full well the busy whisper circling round  Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd  Yet he was kind or if severe in aught  The love he bore to learning was in fault  The village all declar'd how much he knew  'Twas certain he could write and cypher too  Lands he could measure terms and tides presage  And ev'n the story ran that he could gauge  In arguing too the parson own'd his skill  For e'en tho' vanquish'd he could argue still  While words of learned length and thund'ring sound  Amaz'd the gazing rustics rang'd around  And still they gaz'd and still the wonder grew  That one small head could carry all he knew  But past is all his fame The very spot  Where many a time he triumph'd is forgot  Near yonder thorn that lifts its head on high  Where once the signpost caught the passing eye  Low lies that house where nutbrown draughts inspir'd  Where greybeard mirth and smiling toil retir'd  Where village statesmen talk'd with looks profound  And news much older than their ale went round  Imagination fondly stoops to trace  The parlour splendors of that festive place  The whitewash'd wall the nicelysanded floor  The varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door  The chest contriv'd a double debt to pay  A bed by night a chest of draw'rs by day  The pictures plac'd for ornament and use  The twelve good rules the royal game of goose  The hearth except when winter chill'd the day  With aspen boughs and flow'rs and fennel gay  While broken teacups wisely kept for shew  Rang'd o'er the chimney glisten'd in a row  Vain transitory splendor cou'd not all  Reprieve the tott'ring mansion from its fall  Obscure it sinks nor shall it more impart  An hour's importance to the poor man's heart  Thither no more the peasant shall repair  To sweet oblivion of his daily care  No more the farmer's news the barber's tale  No more the woodman's ballad shall prevail  No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear  Relax his pond'rous strength and lean to hear  The host himself no longer shall be found  Careful to see the mantling bliss go round  Nor the coy maid half willing to be prest  Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest  Yes let the rich deride the proud disdain  These simple blessings of the lowly train  To me more dear congenial to my heart  One native charm than all the gloss of art  Spontaneous joys where Nature has its play  The soul adopts and owns their firstborn sway  Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind  Unenvy'd unmolested unconfin'd  But the long pomp the midnight masquerade  With all the freaks of wanton wealth array'd  In these ere triflers half their wish obtain  The toiling pleasure sickens into pain  And ev'n while fashion's brightest arts decoy  The heart distrusting asks if this be joy  Ye friends to truth ye statesmen who survey  The rich man's joys encrease the poor's decay  'Tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand  Between a splendid and an happy land  Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore  And shouting Folly hails them from her shore  Hoards ev'n beyond the miser's wish abound  And rich men flock from all the world around  Yet count our gains This wealth is but a name  That leaves our useful product still the same  Not so the loss The man of wealth and pride  Takes up a space that many poor supply'd  Space for his lake his park's extended bounds  Space for his horses equipage and hounds  The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth  Has robb'd the neighb'ring fields of half their growth  His seat where solitary sports are seen  Indignant spurns the cottage from the green  Around the world each needful product flies  For all the luxuries the world supplies  While thus the land adorn'd for pleasure all  In barren splendor feebly waits the fall  As some fair female unadorn'd and plain  Secure to please while youth confirms her reign  Slights ev'ry borrow'd charm that dress supplies  Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes  But when those charms are past for charms are frail  When time advances and when lovers fail  She then shines forth solicitous to bless  In all the glaring impotence of dress  Thus fares the land by luxury betray'd  In nature's simplest charms at first array'd  But verging to decline its splendors rise  Its vistas strike its palaces surprise  While scourg'd by famine from the smiling land  The mournful peasant leads his humble band  And while he sinks without one arm to save  The country bloomsa garden and a grave  Where then ah where shall poverty reside  To 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride  If to some common's fenceless limits stray'd  He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade  Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide  And ev'n the bareworn common is deny'd  If to the city spedWhat waits him there  To see profusion that he must not share  To see ten thousand baneful arts combin'd  To pamper luxury and thin mankind  To see each joy the sons of pleasure know  Extorted from his fellowcreature's wo  Here while the courtier glitters in brocade  There the pale artist plies the sickly trade  Here while the proud their longdrawn pomps display  There the black gibbet glooms beside the way  The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign  Here richly deckt admits the gorgeous train  Tumultuous grandeur crouds the blazing square  The rattling chariots clash the torches glare  Sure scenes like these no troubles ere annoy  Sure these denote one universal joy  Are these thy serious thoughtsAh turn thine eyes  Where the poor houseless shiv'ring female lies  She once perhaps in village plenty blest  Has wept at tales of innocence distrest  Her modest looks the cottage might adorn  Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn  Now lost to all her friends her virtue fled  Near her betrayer's door she lays her head  And pinch'd with cold and shrinking from the show'r  With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour  When idly first ambitious of the town  She left her wheel and robes of country brown  Do thine sweet AUBURN thine the loveliest train  Do thy fair tribes participate her pain  Ev'n now perhaps by cold and hunger led  At proud mens doors they ask a little bread  Ah no To distant climes a dreary scene  Where half the convex world intrudes between  Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go  Where wild Altama murmurs to their wo  Far different there from all that charm'd before  The various terrors of that horrid shore  Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray  And fiercely shed intolerable day  Those matted woods where birds forget to sing  But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling  Those pois'nous fields with rank luxuriance crown'd  Where the dark scorpion gathers death around  Where at each step the stranger fears to wake  The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake  Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey  And savage men more murd'rous still than they  While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies  Mingling the ravag'd landscape with the skies  Far different these from ev'ry former scene  The cooling brook the grassy vested green  The breezy covert of the warbling grove  That only shelter'd thefts of harmless love  Good Heav'n what sorrows gloom'd that parting day  That call'd them from their native walks away  When the poor exiles ev'ry pleasure past  Hurg round the bow'rs and fondly look'd their last  And took a long farewel and wish'd in vain  For seats like these beyond the western main  And shudd'ring still to face the distant deep  Return'd and wept and still return'd to weep  The good old sire the first prepar'd to go  To newfound worlds and wept for other's wo  But for himself in conscious virtue brave  He only wish'd for worlds beyond the grave  His lovely daughter lovelier in her tears  The fond companion of his helpless years  Silent went next neglectful of her charms  And left a lover's for a father's arms  With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes  And blest the cot where ev'ry pleasure rose  And kist her thoughtless babes with many a tear  And claspt them close in sorrow doubly dear  Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief  In all the silent manliness of grief  O luxury thou curst by heav'n's decree  How ill exchang'd are things like these for thee  How do thy potions with insidious joy  Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy  Kingdoms by thee to sickly greatness grown  Boast of a florid vigour not their own  At ev'ry draught more large and large they grow  A bloated mass of rank unwieldy wo  Till sapp'd their strength and ev'ry part unsound  Down down they sink and spread a ruin round  Ev'n now the devastation is begun  And half the business of destruction done  Ev'n now methinks as pond'ring here I stand  I see the rural virtues leave the land  Down where yon anch'ring vessel spreads the sail  That idly waiting flaps with ev'ry gale  Downward they move a melancholy band  Pass from the shore and darken all the strand  Contented toil and hospitable care  And kind connubial tenderness are there  And piety with wishes plac'd above  And steady loyalty and faithful love  And thou sweet Poetry thou loveliest maid  Still first to fly where sensual joys invade  Unfit in these degen'rate times of shame  To catch the heart or strike for honest fame  Dear charming

fatter  Never rang'd in a forest or smoak'd in a platter  The haunch was a picture for painters to study  The fat was so white and the lean was so ruddy  Tho' my stomach was sharp I could scarce help regretting  To spoil such a delicate picture by eating  I had thoughts in my chambers to place it in view  To be shewn to my friends as a piece of virtu  As in some Irish houses where things are so so  One gammon of bacon hangs up for a show  But for eating a rasher of what they take pride in  They'd as soon think of eating the pan it is fry'd in  But holdlet me pausedon't I hear you pronounce  This tale of the bacon's a damnable bounce  Well suppose it a bouncesure a poet may try  By a bounce now and then to get courage to fly  But my lord it's no bounce I protest in my turn  It's a truthand your lordship may ask Mr Burn  Lord Clare's nephew  To go on with my taleas I gaz'd on the haunch  I thought of a friend that was trusty and staunch  So I cut it and sent it to Reynolds undrest  To paint it or eat it just as he lik'd best  Of the neck and the breast I had next to dispose  'Twas a neck and a breast that might rival Monroe's  But in parting with these I was puzzled again  With the how and the who and the where and the when  There's Hd and Cy and Hrth and Hff  I think they love venisonI know they love beef  There's my countryman HigginsOh let him alone  For making a blunder or picking a bone  But hang itto poets who seldom can eat  Your very good mutton's a very good treat  Such dainties to them their health it might hurt  It's like sending them ruffles when wanting a shirt  While thus I debated in reverie center'd  An acquaintance a friend as he call'd himself enter'd  An underbred finespoken fellow was he  And he smil'd as he look'd at the venison and me  What have we got hereWhy this is good eating  Your own I supposeor is it in waiting  Why whose should it be cried I with a flounce  I get these things oftenbut that was a bounce▪  Some lords my acquaintance that settle the nation  Are pleas'd to be kindbut I hate ostentation  If that be the case then cried he very gay  I'm glad I have taken this house in my way  Tomorrow you take a poor dinner with me  No wordsI insist on'tprecisely at three  We'll have Johnson and Burke all the wits will be there  My acquaintance is slight or I'd ask my lord Clare  And now that I think on't as I am a sinner  We wanted this venison to make out the dinner  What say youa pasty it shall and it must  And my wife little Kitty is famous for crust  Here porterthis venison with me to Mileend  No stirringI begmy dear friendmy dear friend  Thus snatching his hat he brusht off like the wind  And the porter and eatables follow'd behind  Left alone to reflect having emptied my shelf  And "nobody with me at sea but myself"  See the letters that passed between his royal highness Henry duke of Cumberland and lady Grosvenor  o    Tho' I could not help thinking my gentleman hasty  Yet Johnson and Burke and a good venison pasty  Were things that I never disliked in my life  Tho' clogg'd with a coxcomb and Kitty his wife  So next day in due splendor to make my approach  I drove to his door in my own hackneycoach  When come to the place where we all were to dine  A chairlumber'd closet just twelve feet by nine  My friend bade me welcome but struck me quite dumb  With tidings that Johnson and Burke would not come  For I knew it he cried both eternally fail  The one with his speeches and t'other with Thrale  But no matter I'll warrant we'll make up the party  With two full as clever and ten times as hearty  The one is a Scotchman the other a Jew  They both of them merry and authors like you  The one writes the Snarler the other the Scourge  Some thinks he writes Cinnahe owns to Panurge  While thus he describ'd them by trade and by name  They enter'd and dinner was serv'd as they came  At the top a fried liver and bacon were seen  At the bottom was tripe in a swinging tureen  At the sides there was spinnage and pudding made hot  In the middle a place where the pastywas not  Now my lord as for tripe it's my utter aversion  And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Persian  So there I sat stuck like a horse in a pound  While the bacon and liver went merrily round  But what vex'd me most was that d'd Scottish rogue  With his longwinded speeches his smiles and his brogue  And madam quoth he may this bit be my poison  A prettier dinner I never set eyes on  Pray a slice of your liver tho' may I be curst  But I've eat of your tripe till I'm ready to burst  The tripe quoth the Jew with his chocolate cheek  I could dine on this tripe seven days in the week  I like these here dinners so pretty and small  But your friend there thedoctor eats nothing at all  Ooh quoth my friend he'll come on in a trice  He's keeping a corner for something that's nice  There's a pastya pasty repeated the Jew  I don't care if I keep a corner for't too  What the de'il mon a pasty reecho'd the Scot  Though splitting I'll still keep a corner for that  We'll all keep a corner the lady cried out  We'll all keep a corner was echo'd about  While thus we resolv'd and the pasty delay'd  With looks that quite petrified enter'd the maid  A visage so sad and so pale with affright  Wak'd Priam in drawing his curtains by night  But we quickly found out for who could mistake her  That she came with some terrible news from the baker  And so it fell out for that negligent sloven  Had shut out the pasty on shutting his oven  Sad Philomel thusbut let similes drop  And now that I think on't the story may stop  To be plain my good lord it's but labour misplac'd  To send such good verses to one of your taste  You've got an odd somethinga kind of discerning  A relisha tastesicken'd over by learning  At least it's your temper as very well known  That you think very slightly of all that's your own  So perhaps in your habits of thinking amiss  You may make a mistake and think slightly of this  FROM THE ORATORIO OF THE CAPTIVITY  SONG  THE wretch condemn'd with life to part  Still still on hope relies  And ev'ry pang that rends the heart  Bids expectation rise  Hope like the glimm'ring taper's light  Adorns and chears the way  And still as darker grows the night  Emits a brighter ray  SONG  O Memory thou fond deceiver  Still importunate and vain  To former joys recurring ever  And turning all the past to pain  Thou like the world th' opprest oppressing  Thy smiles increase the wretch's wo  And he who wants each other blessing  In thee must ever find a foe  THE CLOWN'S REPLY  JOHN TROTT

people all with one accord  Lament for madam Blaize  Who never wanted a good word  From those who spoke her praise  The needy seldom pass'd her door  And always found her kind  She freely lent to all the poor  Who left a pledge behind  She strove the neighbourhood to please  With manners wond'rous winning  And never follow'd wicked ways  Unless when she was sinning  At church in silks and satins

COMEDY  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN FIRST PRINTED IN MDCCLXVIII  PREFACE  WHEN I undertook to write a comedy I confess I was strongly prepossessed in favour of the poets of the last age and strove to imitate them The term genteel comedy was then unknown amongst us and little more was desired by an audience than nature and humour in whatever walks of life they were most conspicuous The author of the following scenes never imagined that more would be expected of him and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim Those who know any thing of composition are sensible that in pursuing humour it will sometimes lead us into the recesses of the mean I was even tempted to look for it in the master of a spunginghouse but in deference to the public taste grown of late perhaps too delicate the scene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the representation In deference also to the judgment of a few friends who think in a particular way the scene is here restored The author submits it to the reader in his closet and hopes that too much refinement will not banish humour and character from ours as it has already done from the French theatre Indeed the French comedy is now become so very elevated and sentimental that it has not only banished humour and Moliere from the stage but it has banished all spectators too  Upon the whole the author returns his thanks to the public for the favourable reception which the GoodNatur'd Man has met with and to Mr Colman in particular for his kindness to it It may not also be improper to assure any who shall hereafter write for the theatre that merit or supposed merit will ever be a sufficient passport to his protection  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY DR JOHNSON  SPOKEN BY MR BENSLEY  PREST by the load of life the weary mind  Surveys the general toil of human kind  With cool submission joins the lab'ring train  And social sorrow loses half its pain  Our anxious bard without complaint may share  This bustling season's epidemic care  Like Caesar's pilot dignify'd by fate  Tost in one common storm with all the great  Distrest alike the statesman and the wit  When one a borough courts and one the pit  The busy candidates for power and fame  Have hopes and fears and wishes just the same  Disabled both to combat or to fly  Must hear all taunts and hear without reply  Uncheck'd on both loud rabbles vent their rage  As mongrels bay the lion in a cage  Th' offended burgess hoards his angry tale  For that blest year when all that vote may rail  Their schemes of spite the poet's foes dismiss  Till that glad night when all that hate may hiss  This day the powder'd curls and golden coat  Says swelling Crispin begg'd a cobler's vote  This night our wit the pert apprentice cries  Lies at my feet I hiss him and he dies  The great 'tis true can charm th' electing tribe  The bard may supplicate but cannot bribe  Yet judg'd by those whose voices ne'er were sold  He feels no want of illpersuading gold

WILLIAM  GOOD Jarvis make no apologies for this honest bluntness Fidelity like yours is the best excuse for every freedom  JARVIS  I can't help being blunt and being very angry too when I hear you talk of disinheriting so good so worthy a young gentleman as your nephew my master All the world loves him  SIR WILLIAM  Say rather that he loves all the world that is his fault  JARVIS  I'm sure there is no part of it more dear to him than you are tho' he has not seen you since he was a child  SIR WILLIAM  What signifies his affection to me or how can I be proud of a place in a heart where every sharper and coxcomb find an easy entrance  JARVIS  I grant you that he's rather too goodnatur'd that he's too much every man's man that he laughs this minute with one and cries the next with another but whose instructions may he thank for all this  SIR WILLIAM  Not mine sure My letters to him during my employment in Italy taught him only that philosophy which might prevent not defend his errors  JARVIS  Faith begging your honour's pardon I'm sorry they taught him any philosophy at all it has only serv'd to spoil him This same philosophy is a good horse in the stable but an errant jade on a journey For my own part whenever I hear him mention the name on't I'm always sure he's going to play the fool  SIR WILLIAM  Don't let us ascribe his faults to his philosophy I entreat you No Jarvis his good nature arises rather from his fears of offending the importunate than his desire of making the deserving happy  JARVIS  What it rises from I don't know But to be sure every body has it that asks it  SIR WILLIAM  Ay or that does not ask it I have been now for some time a concealed spectator of his follies and find them as boundless as his dissipation  JARVIS  And yet faith he has some fine name or other for them all He calls his extravagance generosity and his trusting every body universal benevolence It was but last week he went security for a fellow whose face he scarce knew and that he called an act of exalted mumumunificence ay that was the name he gave it  SIR WILLIAM  And upon that I proceed as my last effort tho' with very little hopes to reclaim him That very fellow has just absconded and I have taken up the security Now my intention is to involve him in fictitious distress before he has plunged himself into real calamity To arrest him for that very debt to clap an officer upon him and then let him see which of his friends will come to his relief  JARVIS  Well if I could but any way see him thoroughly vexed every groan of his would be music to me yet faith I believe it impossible I have tried to fret him myself every morning these three years but instead of being angry he sits as calmly to hear me scold as he does to his hairdresser  SIR WILLIAM  We must try him once more however and I'll go this instant to put my scheme into execution and I don't despair of succeeding as by your means I can have frequent opportunities of being about him without being known What a pity it is Jarvis that any man's good will to others should produce so much neglect of himself as to require correction Yet we must touch his weaknesses with a delicate  hand There are some faults so nearly allied to excellence that we can scarce weed out the vice without eradicating the virtue    Exit  JARVIS  Well go thy ways sir William Honeywood It is not without reason that the world allows thee to be the best of men But here comes his hopeful nephew the strange goodnatur'd foolish openheartedAnd yet all his faults are such that one loves him still the better for them  Enter HONEYWOOD  HONEYWOOD  Well Jarvis what messages from my friends this morning  JARVIS  You have no friends  HONEYWOOD  Well from my acquaintance then  JARVIS    Pulling out bills    A few of our usual cards of compliment that's all This bill from your taylor this from your mercer and this from the little broker in Crookedlane He says he has been at a great deal of trouble to get back the money you borrowed  HONEYWOOD  That I don't know but I'm sure we were at a great deal of trouble in getting him to lend it  JARVIS  He has lost all patience  HONEYWOOD  Then he has lost a very good thing  JARVIS  There's that ten guineas you were sending to the poor gentleman and his children in the Fleet I believe that would stop his mouth for a while at least  HONEYWOOD  Ay Jarvis but what will fill their mouths in the mean time Must I be cruel because he happens to be importunate and to relieve his avarice leave them to insupportable distress  JARVIS  'Sdeath sir the question now is how to relieve yourself YourselfHav'nt I reason to be out of my senses when I see things going at sixes and sevens  HONEYWOOD  Whatever reason you may have for being out of your senses I hope you'll allow that I'm not quite unreasonable for continuing in mine  JARVIS  You're the only man alive in your present situation that could do soEvery thing upon the waste There's miss Richland and her fine fortune gone already and upon the point of being given to your rival  HONEYWOOD  I'm no man's rival  JARVIS  Your uncle in Italy preparing to disinherit you your own fortune almost spent and nothing but pressing creditors false friends and a pack of drunken servants that your kindness has made unfit for any other family  HONEYWOOD  Then they have the more occasion for being in mine  JARVIS  Soh What will you have done with him that I caught stealing your plate in the pantry In the fact I caught him in the fact  HONEYWOOD  In the fact If so I really think that we should pay him his wages and turn him off  JARVIS  He shall be turn'd off at Tyburn the dog we'll hang him if it be only to frighten the rest of the family  HONEYWOOD  No Jarvis it's enough that we have lost what he has stolen let us not add to it the loss of a fellow creature  JARVIS  Very fine well here was the footman just now to complain of the butler he says he does most work and ought to have most wages  HONEYWOOD  That's but just tho' perhaps here comes the butler to complain of the footman  JARVIS  Ay its the way with them all from the scullion to the privycounsellor If they have a bad master they keep quarrelling with him if they have a goodmaster they keep quarrelling with one another  Enter BUTLER drunk  BUTLER  Sir I'll not stay in the family with Jonathan you must part with him or part with me that's the exexexposition of the matter sir  HONEYWOOD  Full and explicit enough But what's his fault good Philip  BUTLER  Sir he's given to drinking sir and I shall have my morals corrupted by keeping such company  HONEYWOOD  Ha ha He has such a diverting way  JARVIS  O quite amusing  BUTLER  I find my wines agoing sir and liquors don't go without mouths sir I hate a drunkard sir  HONEYWOOD  Well well Philip I'll hear you upon that another time so go to bed now  JARVIS  To bed Let him go to the devil  BUTLER  Begging your honour's pardon and begging your pardon master Jarvis I'll not go to bed nor to the devil neither I have enough to do to mind my cellar I forgot your honour Mr Croaker is below I came on purpose to tell you  HONEYWOOD  Why didn't you shew him up blockhead  BUTLER  Shew him up sir With all my heart sir Up or down all's one to me    Exit  JARVIS  Ay we have one or other of that family in this house from morning till night He comes on the old affair I suppose The match between his son  that's just returned from Paris and miss Richland the young lady he's guardian to  HONEYWOOD  Perhaps so Mr Croaker knowing my friendship for the young lady has got it into his head that I can persuade her to what I please  JARVIS  Ah If you lov'd yourself but half as well as she loves you we should soon see a marriage that would set all things to rights again  HONEYWOOD  Love me Sure Jarvis you dream No no her intimacy with me never amounted to more than friendshipmere friendship That she is the most lovely woman that ever warm'd the human heart with desire I own But never let me harbour a thought of making her unhappy by a connection with one so unworthy her merits as I am No Jarvis it shall be my study to serve her even in spite of my wishes and to secure her happiness tho' it destroys my own  JARVIS  Was ever the like I want patience  HONEYWOOD  Besides Jarvis tho' I could obtain miss Richland's consent do you think I could succeed with her guardian or Mrs Croaker his wife who tho' both very fine in their way are yet a little opposite in their dispositions you know  JARVIS  Opposite enough heaven knows the very reverse of each other she all laugh and no joke he always complaining and never sorrowful a fretful poor soul that has a new distress for every hour in the four and twenty  HONEYWOOD  Hush hush he's coming up he'll hear you  JARVIS  One whose voice is a passing bell  HONEYWOOD  Well well go do  JARVIS  A raven that bodes nothing but mischief a coffin and cross bones a bundle of rue a sprig of deadly night shade a    Honeywood stopping his mouth at last pushes him off      Exit  Jarvis  HONEYWOOD  I must own my old monitor is not entirely wrong There is something in my friend Croaker's conversation that quite depresses me His very mirth is an antidote to all gaiety and his appearance has a stronger effect on my spirits than an undertaker's shopMr Croaker this is such a satisfaction  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  A pleasant morning to Mr Honeywood and many of them How is this You look most shockingly to day my dear friend I hope this weather does not affect your spirits To be sure if this weather continuesI say nothingBut God send we be all better this day three months  HONEYWOOD  I heartily concur in the wish tho' I own not in your apprehensions  CROAKER  May be not Indeed what signifies what weather we have in a country going to ruin like ours Taxes  rising and trade falling Money flying out of the kingdom and Jesuits swarming into it I know at this time no less than an hundred and twentyseven Jesuits between Charingcross and Templebar  HONEYWOOD  The Jesuits will scarce pervert you or me I should hope  CROAKER  May be not Indeed what signifies whom they pervert in a country that has scarce any religion to lose I'm only afraid for our wives and daughters  HONEYWOOD  I have no apprehensions for the ladies I assure you  CROAKER  May be not Indeed what signifies whether they be perverted or no The women in my time were good for something I have seen a lady drest from top to toe in her own manufactures formerly But now adays the devil a thing of their own manufactures about them except their faces  HONEYWOOD  But however these faults may be practised abroad you don't find them at home either with Mrs Croaker Olivia or miss Richland  CROAKER  The best of them will never be canoniz'd for a saint when she's dead By the bye my dear friend I don't find this match between miss Richland and my son much relish'd either by one side or t'other  HONEYWOOD  I thought otherwise  CROAKER  Ah Mr Honeywood a little of your fine serious advice to the young lady might go far I know  she has a very exalted opinion of your understanding  HONEYWOOD  But would not that be usurping an authority that more properly belongs to yourself  CROAKER  My dear friend you know but little of my authority at home People think indeed because they see me come out in a morning thus with a pleasant face and to make my friends merry that all's well within But I have cares that would break an heart of stone My wife has so encroach'd upon every one of my privileges that I'm now no more than a mere lodger in my own house  HONEYWOOD  But a little spirit exerted on your side might perhaps restore your authority  CROAKER  No tho' I had the spirit of a lion I do rouze sometimes But what then Always haggling and haggling A man is tired of getting the better before his wife is tired of losing the victory  HONEYWOOD  It's a melancholy consideration indeed that our chief comforts often produce our greatest anxieties and that an encrease of our possessions is but an inlet to new disquietudes  CROAKER  Ah my dear friend these were the very words of poor Dick Doleful to me not a week before he made away with himself Indeed Mr Honeywood I nener see you but you put me in mind of poorDick Ah there was merit neglected for you and so true a  friend we lov'd each other for thirty years and yet he never asked me to lend him a single farthing  HONEYWOOD  Pray what could induce him to commit so rash an action at last  CROAKER  I don't know some people were malicious enough to say it was keeping company with me because we us'd to meet now and then and open our hearts to each other To be sure I lov'd to hear him talk and he lov'd to hear me talk poor dear Dick He us'd to say that Croaker rhim'd to joker and so we us'd to laughPoor Dick    Going to cry    HONEYWOOD  His fate affects me  CROAKER  Ay he grew sick of this miserable life where we do nothing but eat and grow hungry dress and undress get up and lie down while reason that should watch like a nurse by our side falls as fast asleep as we do  HONEYWOOD  To say truth if we compare that part of life which is to come by that which we have past the prospect is hideous  CROAKER  Life at the greatest and best is but a froward child that must be humour'd and coax'd a little till it falls asleep and then all the care is over  HONEYWOOD  Very true sir nothing can exceed the vanity of our existence but the folly of our pursuits We wept when we came into the world and every day tells us why  CROAKER  Ah my dear friend it is a perfect satisfaction to be miserable with you My son Leontine shan't lose the benefit of such fine conversation I'll just step home for him I am willing to shew him so much seriousness in one scarce older than himselfAnd what if I bring my last letter to the Gazetteer on the encrease and progress of earthquakes It will amuse us I promise you I there prove how the late earthquake is coming round to pay us another visit from London to Lisbon from Lisbon to the Canary Islands from the Canary Islands to Palmyra from Palmyra to Constantinople and so from Constantinople back to London again    Exit  HONEYWOOD  Poor Croaker His situation deserves the utmost pity I shall scarce recover my spirits these three days Sure to live upon such terms is worse than death itself And yet when I consider my own situation a broken fortune an hopeless passion friends in distress the wish but not the power to serve them    pausing and sighing    Enter BUTLER  BUTLER  More company below sir Mrs Croaker and miss Richland shall I shew them up But they're shewing up themselves    Exit  Enter MRS CROAKER and MISS RICHLAND  MISS RICHLAND  You're always in such spirits  MRS CROAKER  We have just come my dear Honeywood from the auction There was the old deaf dowager as usual bidding like a fury against herself And then so curious in antiques herself the most genuine piece of antiquity in the whole collection  HONEYWOOD  Excuse me ladies if some uneasiness from friendship makes me unfit to share in this good humour I know you'll pardon me  MRS CROAKER  I vow he seems as melancholy as if he had taken a dose of my husband this morning Well if Richland here can pardon you I must  MISS RICHLAND  You would seem to insinuate madam that I have particular reasons for being dispos'd to refuse it  MRS CROAKER  Whatever I insinuate my dear don't be so ready to wish an explanation  MISS RICHLAND  I own I should be sorry Mr Honeywood's long friendship and mine should be misunderstood  HONEYWOOD  There's no answering for others madam But I hope you'll never find me presuming to offer more than the most delicate friendship may readily allow  MISS RICHLAND  And I shall be prouder of such a tribute from you than the most passionate professions from others  HONEYWOOD  My own sentiments madam friendship is a disinterested commerce between equals love an abject intercourse between tyrants and slaves  MISS RICHLAND  And without a compliment I know none more disinterested or more capable of friendship than Mr Honeywood  MRS CROAKER  And indeed I know nobody that has more friends at least among the ladies Miss Fruzz miss Odbody and miss Winterbottom praise him in all companies As for miss Biddy Bundle she's his professed admirer  MISS RICHLAND  Indeed an admirer I did not know sir you were such a favourite there But is she seriously so handsome Is she the mighty thing talked of  HONEYWOOD  The town madam seldom begins to praise a lady's beauty till she's beginning to lose it    Smiling    MRS CROAKER  But she's resolved never to lose it it seems For as her natural face decays her skill improves in making the artificial one Well nothing diverts me more than one of those fine old dressy things who thinks to conceal her age by every where exposing her person sticking herself up in the front of a sidebox trailing through a minuet at Almack's and then in the public gardens looking for all the world like one of the painted ruins of the place  HONEYWOOD  Every age has its admirers ladies While you perhaps are trading among the warmer climates of youth there ought to be some to carry on an useful commerce in the frozen latitudes beyond fifty  MISS RICHLAND  But then the mortifications they must suffer before they can be fitted out for traffic I have seen  one of them fret an whole morning at her hairdresser when all the fault was her face  HONEYWOOD  And yet I'll engage has carried that face at last to a very good market This goodnatur'd town madam has husbands like spectacles to fit every age from fifteen to fourscore  MRS CROAKER  Well you're a dear goodnatur'd creature But you know you're engaged with us this morning upon a strolling party I want to shew Olivia the town and the things I believe I shall have business for you for the whole day  HONEYWOOD  I am sorry madam I have an appointment with Mr Croaker which it is impossible to put off  MRS CROAKER  What with my husband Then I'm resolved to take no refusal Nay I protest you must You know I never laugh so much as with you  HONEYWOOD  Why if I must I must I'll swear you have put me into such spirits Well do you find jest and I'll find laugh I promise you We'll wait for the chariot in the next room    Exeunt  Enter LEONTINE and OLIVIA  LEONTINE  There they go thoughtless and happy My dearest Olivia what would I give to see you capable of sharing in their amusements and as chearful as they are  OLIVIA  How my Leontine how can I be chearful when I have so many terrors to oppress me The fear of being detected by this family and the apprehensions of a censuring world when I must be detected  LEONTINE  The world my love what can it say At worst it can only say that being compelled by a mercenary guardian to embrace a life you disliked you formed a resolution of flying with the man of your choice that you confided in his honour and took refuge in my father's house the only one where your's could remain without censure  OLIVIA  But consider Leontine your disobedience and my indiscretion your being sent to France to bring home a sister and instead of a sister bringing home  LEONTINE  One dearer than a thousand sisters One that I am convinc'd will be equally dear to the rest of the family when she comes to be known  OLIVIA  And that I fear will shortly be  LEONTINE  Impossible 'till we ourselves think proper to make the discovery My sister you know has been with her aunt at Lyons since she was a child and you find every creature in the family takes you for her  OLIVIA  But may'nt she write may'nt her aunt write  LEONTINE  Her aunt scarce ever writes and all my sister's letters are directed to me  OLIVIA  But won't your refusing miss Richland for whom you know the old gentleman intends you create a suspicion  LEONTINE  There there's my masterstroke I have resolved not to refuse her nay an hour hence I have consented to go with my father to make her an offer of my heart and fortune  OLIVIA  Your heart and fortune  LEONTINE  Don't be alarm'd my dearest Can Olivia think so meanly of my honour or my love as to suppose I could ever hope for happiness from any but her No my Olivia neither the force nor permit me to add the delicacy of my passion leave any room to suspect me I only offer miss Richland an heart I am convinc'd she will refuse as I am confident that without knowing it her affections are fixed upon Mr Honeywood  OLIVIA  Mr Honeywood You'll excuse my apprehensions but when your merits come to be put in the balance  LEONTINE  You view them with too much partiality However by making this offer I shew a seeming compliance with my father's command and perhaps upon her refusal I may have his consent to chuse for myself  OLIVIA  Well I submit And yet my Leontine I own I shall envy her even your pretended addresses I  consider every look every expression of your esteem as due only to me This is folly perhaps I allow it but it is natural to suppose that merit which has made an impression on one's own heart may be powerful over that of another  LEONTINE  Don't my life's treasure don't let us make imaginary evils when you know we have so many real ones to encounter At worst you know if miss Richland should consent or my father refuse his pardon it can but end in a trip to Scotland and  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  Where have you been boy I have been seeking you My friend Honeywood here has been saying such comfortable things Ah he's an example indeed Where is he I left him here  LEONTINE  Sir I believe you may see him and hear him too in the next room he's preparing to go out with the ladies  CROAKER  Good gracious can I believe my eyes or my ears I'm struck dumb with his vivacity and stunn'd with the loudness of his laugh Was there ever such a transformation    A laugh behind the scenes Croaker mimics it    Ha ha ha there it goes a plague take their balderdash yet I could expect nothing less when my precious wife was of the party On my conscience I believe she could spread an horselaugh thro' the pews of a tabernacle  LEONTINE  Since you find so many objections to a wife sir how can you be so earnest in recommending one to me  CROAKER  I have told you and tell you again boy that miss Richland's fortune must not go out of the family one may find comfort in the money whatever one does in the wife  LEONTINE  But sir tho' in obedience to your desire I am ready to marry her it may be possible she has no inclination to me  CROAKER  I'll tell you once for all how it stands A good part of miss Richland's large fortune consists in a claim upon government which my good friend Mr Lofty assures me the treasury will allow One half of this she is to forfeit by her father's will in case she refuses to marry you So if she rejects you we seize half her fortune if she accepts you we seize the whole and a fine girl into the bargain  LEONTINE  But sir if you will but listen to reason  CROAKER  Come then produce your reasons I tell you I'm fix'd determined so now produce your reasons When I'm determined I always listen to reason because it can then do no harm  LEONTINE  You have alleged that a mutual choice was the first requisite in matrimonial happiness  CROAKER  Well and you have both of you a mutual choice She has her choiceto marry you or lose half her  fortune and you have your choiceto marry her or pack out of doors without any fortune at all  LEONTINE  An only son sir might expect more indulgence  CROAKER  An only father sir might expect more obedience besides has not your sister here that never disobliged me in her life as good a right as you He's a sad dog Livy my dear and would take all from you But he shan't I tell you he shan't for you shall have your share  OLIVIA  Dear sir I wish you'd be convinced that I can never be happy in any addition to my fortune which is taken from his  CROAKER  Well well it's a good child so say no more but come with me and we shall see something that will give us a great deal of pleasure I promise you old Ruggins the currycombmaker lying in state I'm told he makes a very handsome corpse and becomes his coffin prodigiously He was an intimate friend of mine and these are friendly things we ought to do for each other    Exeunt  ACT THE SECOND  SCENE CROAKER'S house  MISS RICHLAND GARNET  MISS RICHLAND  OLIVIA not his sister Olivia not Leontine's sister You amaze me  GARNET  No more his sister than I am I had it all from his own servant I can get any thing from that quarter  MISS RICHLAND  But how Tell me again Garnet  GARNET  Why madam as I told you before instead of going to Lyons to bring home his sister who has been there with her aunt these ten years he never went further than Paris there he saw and fell in love with this young lady by the bye of a prodigious family  MISS RICHLAND  And brought her home to my guardian as his daughter  GARNET  Yes and his daughter she will be If he don't consent to their marriage they talk of trying what a Scotch parson can do  MISS RICHLAND  Well I own they have deceived meAnd so demurely as Olivia carried it tooWould you believe it Garnet I told her all my secrets and yet the sly cheat concealed all this from me  GARNET  And upon my word madam I don't much blame her she was loath to trust one with her secrets that was so very bad at keeping her own  MISS RICHLAND  But to add to their deceit the young gentleman it seems pretends to make me serious proposals My guardian and he are to be here presently to open the affair in form You know I am to lose half my fortune if I refuse him  GARNET  Yet what can you do For being as you are in love with Mr Honeywood madam  MISS RICHLAND  How idiot what do you mean In love with Mr Honeywood Is this to provoke me  GARNET  That is madam in friendship with him I meant nothing more than friendship as I hope to be married nothing more  MISS RICHLAND  Well no more of this As to my guardian and his son they shall find me prepared to receive them I'm resolved to accept their proposal with seeming pleasure to mortify them by compliance and so throw the refusal at last upon them  GARNET  Delicious and that will secure your whole fortune to yourself Well who could have thought so innocent a face could cover so much cuteness  MISS RICHLAND  Why girl I only oppose my prudence to their cunning and practise a lesson they have taught me against themselves  GARNET  Then you're likely not long to want employment for here they come and in close conference  Enter CROAKER LEONTINE  LEONTINE  Excuse me sir if I seem to hesitate upon the point of putting to the lady so important a question  CROAKER  Lord good sir moderate your fears you're so plaguy shy that one would think you had changed sexes I tell you we must have the half or the whole Come let me see with what spirit you begin Well why don't you Eh What Well thenI must it seemsMiss Richland my dear I believe you guess at our business an affair which my son here comes to open that nearly concerns your happiness  MISS RICHLAND  Sir I should be ungrateful not to be pleased with any thing that comes recommended by you  CROAKER  How boy could you desire a finer opening Why don't you begin I say    To Leont    LEONTINE  'Tis true madam my father madam has some intentionshemof explaining an affairwhichhimselfcan best explain madam  CROAKER  Yes my dear it comes intirely from my son it's all a request of his own madam And I will permit him to make the best of it  LEONTINE  The whole affair is only this madam my father has a proposal to make which he insists none but himself shall deliver  CROAKER  My mind misgives me the fellow will never be brought on    Aside    In short madam you see before you one that loves you one whose whole happiness is all in you  MISS RICHLAND  I never had any doubts of your regard sir and I hope you can have none of my duty  CROAKER  That's not the thing my little sweeting my love No no another guess lover than I there he stands madam his very looks declare the force of his passionCall up a look you dogBut then had you seen him as I have weeping speaking soliloquies and blank verse sometimes melancholy and sometimes absent  MISS RICHLAND  I fear sir he's absent now or such a declaration would have come most properly from himself  CROAKER  Himself madam he would die before he could make such a confession and if he had not a channel for his passion thro' me it would ere now have drowned his understanding  MISS RICHLAND  I must grant sir there are attractions in modest diffidence above the force of words A silent address is the genuine eloquence of sincerity  CROAKER  Madam he has forgot to speak any other language silence is become his mother tongue  MISS RICHLAND  And it must be confessed sir it speaks very powerfully in his favour And yet I shall be thought too  forward in making such a confession shan't I Mr Leontine  LEONTINE  Confusion my reserve will undo me But if modesty attracts her impudence may disgust her I'll try    Aside    Don't imagine from my silence madam that I want a due sense of the honour and happiness intended me My father madam tells me your humble servant is not totally indifferent to you He admires you I adore you and when we come together upon my soul I believe we shall be the happiest couple in all St James's  MISS RICHLAND  If I could flatter myself you thought as you speak sir  LEONTINE  Doubt my sincerity madam By your dear self I swear Ask the brave if they desire glory ask cowards if they covet safety  CROAKER  Well well no more questions about it  LEONTINE  Ask the sick if they long for health ask misers if they love money ask  CROAKER  Ask a fool if he can talk nonsense What's come over the boy What signifies asking when there's not a soul to give you an answer If you would ask to the purpose ask this lady's consent to make you happy  MISS RICHLAND  Why indeed sir his uncommon ardour almost compels me forces me to comply And yet I'm afraid he'll despise a conquest gained with too much ease won't you Mr Leontine  LEONTINE  Confusion    Aside    O by no means madam by no means And yet madam you talked of force There is nothing I would avoid so much as compulsion in a thing of this kind No madam I will still be generous and leave you at liberty to refuse  CROAKER  But I tell you sir the lady is not at liberty It's a match You see she says nothing Silence gives consent  LEONTINE  But sir she talked of force Consider sir the cruelty of constraining her inclinations  CROAKER  But I say there's no cruelty Don't you know blockhead that girls have always a roundabout way of saying yes before company So get you both gone together into the next room and hang him that interrupts the tender explanation Get you gone I say I'll not hear a word  LEONTINE  But sir I must beg leave to insist  CROAKER  Get off you puppy or I'll beg leave to insist upon knocking you down Stupid whelp But I don't wonder the boy takes entirely after his mother    Exeunt miss  Rich  and  Leont  Enter MRS CROAKER  MRS CROAKER  Mr Croaker I bring you something my dear that I believe will make you smile  CROAKER  I'll hold you a guinea of that my dear  MRS CROAKER  A letter and as I knew the hand I ventured to open it  CROAKER  And how can you expect your breaking open my letters should give me pleasure  MRS CROAKER  Poo it's from your sister at Lyons and contains good news read it  CROAKER  What a Frenchified cover is here That sister of mine has some good qualities but I could never teach her to fold a letter  MRS CROAKER  Fold a fiddlestick Read what it contains  CROAKER reading  'DEAR NICK  'AN English gentleman of large fortune has for some time made private tho' honourable proposals to your daughter Olivia They love each other tenderly and I find she has consented without letting any of the family know to crown his addresses As such good offers don't come every day your own good sense his large fortune and family considerations will induce you to forgive her  'Yours ever RACHEL CROAKER'  My daughter Olivia privately contracted to a man of large fortune This is good news indeed My heart never foretold me of this And yet how slily the little baggage has carried it since she came home Not a word on't to the old ones for the world Yet I thought I saw something she wanted to conceal  MRS CROAKER  Well if they have concealed their amour they shan't conceal their wedding that shall be public I'm resolved  CROAKER  I tell thee woman the wedding is the most foolish part of the ceremony I can never get this woman to think of the more serious part of the nuptial engagement  MRS CROAKER  What would you have me think of their funeral But come tell me my dear don't you owe more to me than you care to confess Would you have ever been known to Mr Lofty who has undertaken miss Richland's claim at the treasury but for me Who was it first made him an acquaintance at lady Shabbaroon's rout Who got him to promise us his interest Is not he a backstairs favourite one that can do what he pleases with those that do what they please Isn't he an acquaintance that all your groaning and lamentations could never have got us  CROAKER  He is a man of importance I grant you And yet what amazes me is that while he is giving away places to all the world he can't get one for himself  MRS CROAKER  That perhaps may be owing to his nicety Great men are not easily satisfied  Enter FRENCH SERVANT  SERVANT  An expresse from monsieur Lofty He vil be vait upon your honour's instrammant He be only giving  four five instruction read two three memorial call upon von ambassadeur He vil be vid you in one tree minutes  MRS CROAKER  You see now my dear What an extensive department Well friend let your master know that we are extremely honoured by this honour Was there any thing ever in a higher style of breeding All messages among the great are now done by express  CROAKER  To be sure no man does little things with more solemnity or claims more respect than he But he's in the right on't In our bad world respect is given where respect is claim'd  MRS CROAKER  Never mind the world my dear you were never in a pleasanter place in your life Let us now think of receiving him with proper respect    a loud rapping at the door    and there he is by the thundering rap  CROAKER  Ay verily there he is as close upon the heels of his own express as an indorsement upon the back of a bill Well I'll leave you to receive him whilst I go to chide my little Olivia for intending to steal a marriage without mine or her aunt's consent I must seem to be angry or she too may begin to despise my authority    Exit  Enter LOFTY speaking to his servant  LOFTY  And if the Venetian ambassador or that teazing creature the marquis should call I'm not at home Dam'me I'll be packhorse to none of them My dear madam I have just snatched a momentAnd if  the expresses to his grace be ready let them be sent off they're of importance Madam I ask a thousand pardons  MRS CROAKER  Sir this honour  LOFTY  And Dubardieu if the person calls about the commission let him know that it is made out As for lord Cumbercourt's stale request it can keep cold you understand me Madam I ask ten thousand pardons  MRS CROAKER  Sir this honour  LOFTY  And Dubardieu if the man comes from the Cornish borough you must do him you must do him I say Madam I ask ten thousand pardons And if the Russianambassador calls but he will scarce call today I believe And now madam I have just got time to express my happiness in having the honour of being permitted to profess myself your most obedient humble servant  MRS CROAKER  Sir the happiness and honour are all mine and yet I'm only robbing the public while I detain you  LOFTY  Sink the public madam when the fair are to be attended Ah could all my hours be so charmingly devoted Sincerely don't you pity us poor creatures in affairs Thus it is eternally solicited for places here teized for pensions there and courted every where I know you pity me Yes I see you do  MRS CROAKER  Excuse me sir Toils of empires pleasures are as Waller says  LOFTY  Waller Waller is he of the house  MRS CROAKER  The modern poet of that name sir  LOFTY  Oh a modern We men of business despise the moderns and as for the ancients we have no time to read them Poetry is a pretty thing enough for our wives and daughters but not for us Why now here I stand that know nothing of books I say madam I know nothing of books and yet I believe upon a land carriage fishery a stamp act or a jaghire I can talk my two hours without feeling the want of them  MRS CROAKER  The world is no stranger to Mr Lofty's eminence in every capacity  LOFTY  I vow to gad madam you make me blush I'm nothing nothing nothing in the world a mere obscure gentleman To be sure indeed one or two of the present ministers are pleased to represent me as a formidable man I know they are pleased to bespatter me at all their little dirty levees Yet upon my foul I wonder what they see in me to treat me so Measures not men have always been my mark and I vow by all that's honourable my resentment has never done the men as mere men any manner of harmthat is as mere men  MRS CROAKER  What importance and yet what modesty  LOFTY  Oh if you talk of modesty madam there I own I'm accessible to praise modesty is my foible it was so the duke of Brentford used to say of me I love  Jack Lofty he used to say no man has a finer knowledge of things quite a man of information and when he speaks upon his legs by the Lord he's prodigious he scouts them and yet all men have their faults too much modesty is his says his grace  MRS CROAKER  And yet I dare say you don't want assurance when you come to solicit for your friends  LOFTY  O there indeed I'm in bronze Apropos I have just been mentioning miss Richland's case to a certain personage we must name no names When I ask I am not to be put off madam No no I take my friend by the button A sine girl sir great justice in her case A friend of mine Borough interest Business must be done Mr Secretary I say Mr Secretary her business must be done sir That's my way madam  MRS CROAKER  Bless me you said all this to the secretary of state did you  LOFTY  I did not say the secretary did I Well curse it since you have found me out I will not deny it It was to the secretary  MRS CROAKER  This was going to the fountain head at once not applying to the understrappers as Mr Honeywood would have had us  LOFTY  Honeywood he he He was indeed a fine solicitor I suppose you have heard what has just happened to him  MRS CROAKER  Poor dear man no accident I hope  LOFTY  Undone madam that's all His creditors have taken him into custody A prisoner in his own house  MRS CROAKER  A prisoner in his own house How At this very time I'm quite unhappy for him  LOFTY  Why so am I The man to be sure was immensely goodnatur'd But then I could never find that he had any thing in him  MRS CROAKER  His manner to be sure was excessive harmless some indeed thought it a little dull For my part I always concealed my opinion  LOFTY  It can't be concealed madam the man was dull dull as the last new comedy A poor impracticable creature I tried once or twice to know if he was fit for business but he had scarce talents to be groomporter to an orange barrow  MRS CROAKER  How differently does miss Richland think of him For I believe with all his faults she loves him  LOFTY  Loves him Does she You should cure her of that by all means Let me see what if she were sent to him this instant in his present doleful situation My life for it that works her cure Distress is a perfect antidote to love Suppose we join her in the next room Miss Richland is a fine girl has a fine fortune and must not be thrown away Upon my honour madam I have a regard for miss Richland  and rather than she should be thrown away I should think it no indignity to marry her myself    Exeunt  Enter OLIVIA and LEONTINE  LEONTINE  And yet trust me Olivia I had every reason to expect miss Richland's refusal as I did every thing in my power to deserve it Her indelicacy surprises me  OLIVIA  Sure Leontine there's nothing so indelicate in being sensible of your merit If so I fear I shall be the most guilty thing alive  LEONTINE  But you mistake my dear The same attention I used to advance my merit with you I practised to lessen it with her What more could I do  OLIVIA  Let us now rather consider what's to be done We have both dissembled too longI have always been ashamedI am now quite weary of it Sure I could never have undergone so much for any other but you  LEONTINE  And you shall find my gratitude equal to your kindest compliance Tho' our friends should totally forsake us Olivia we can draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune  OLIVIA  Then why should we defer our scheme of humble happiness when it is now in our power I may be the favourite of your father it is true but can it ever be thought that his present kindness to a supposed child will continue to a known deceiver  LEONTINE  I have many reasons to believe it will As his attachments are but few they are lasting His own marriage was a private one as ours may be Besides I have sounded him already at a distance and find all his answers exactly to our wish Nay by an expression or two that dropped from him I am induced to think he knows of this affair  OLIVIA  Indeed But that would be an happiness too great to be expected  LEONTINE  However it be I'm certain you have power over him and am persuaded if you informed him of our situation that he would be disposed to pardon it  OLIVIA  You had equal expectations Leontine from your last scheme with miss Richland which you find has succeeded most wretchedly  LEONTINE  And that's the best reason for trying another  OLIVIA  If it must be so I submit  LEONTINE  As we could wish he comes this way Now my dearest Olivia be resolute I'll just retire within hearing to come in at a proper time either to share your danger or confirm your victory    Exit  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  Yes I must forgive her and yet not too easily neither It will be proper to keep up the decorums  of resentment a little if it be only to impress her with an idea of my authority  OLIVIA  How I tremble to approach himMight I presume sirIf I interrupt you  CROAKER  No child where I have an affection it is not a little thing can interrupt me Affection gets over little things  OLIVIA  Sir you're too kind I'm sensible how ill I deserve this partiality Yet heaven knows there is nothing I would not do to gain it  CROAKER  And you have but too well succeeded you little hussey you With those endearing ways of yours on my conscience I could be brought to forgive any thing unless it were a very great offence indeed  OLIVIA  But mine is such an offenceWhen you know my guiltYes you shall know it tho' I feel the greatest pain in the confession  CROAKER  Why then if it be so very great a pain you may spare yourself the trouble for I know every syllable of the matter before you begin  OLIVIA  Indeed Then I'm undone  CROAKER  Ay miss you wanted to steal a match without letting me know it did you But I'm not worth being consulted I suppose when there's to be a marriage in my own family No I'm to have no hand in the disposal of my own children No I'm  nobody I'm to be a mere article of family lumber a piece of crack'd china to be stuck up in a corner  OLIVIA  Dear sir nothing but the dread of your authority could induce us to conceal it from you  CROAKER  No no my consequence is no more I'm as little minded as a dead Russian in winter just stuck up with a pipe in his mouth till there comes a thawIt goes to my heart to vex her  OLIVIA  I was prepared sir for your anger and despaired of pardon even while I presumed to ask it But your severity shall never abate my affection as my punishment is but justice  CROAKER  And yet you should not despair neither Livy We ought to hope all for the best  OLIVIA  And do you permit me to hope sir Can I ever expect to be forgiven But hope has too long deceived me  CROAKER  Why then child it shan't deceive you now for I forgive you this very moment I forgive you all and now you are indeed my daughter  OLIVIA  O transport This kindness overpowers me  CROAKER  I was always against severity to our children We have been young and giddy ourselves and we can't expect boys and girls to be old before their time  OLIVIA  What generosity But can you forget the many falsehoods the dissimulation  CROAKER  You did indeed dissemble you urchin you but where's the girl that won't dissemble for an husband My wife and I had never been married if we had not dissembled a little beforehand  OLIVIA  It shall be my future care never to put such generosity to a second trial And as for the partner of my offence and folly from his native honour and the just sense he has of his duty I can answer for him that  Enter LEONTINE  LEONTINE  Permit him thus to answer for himself    Kneeling    Thus sir let me speak my gratitude for this unmerited forgiveness Yes sir this even exceeds all your former tenderness I now can boast the most indulgent of fathers The life he gave compared to this was but a trifling blessing  CROAKER  And good sir who sent for you with that fine tragedy face and flourishing manner I don't know what we have to do with your gratitude upon this occasion  LEONTINE  How sir Is it possible to be silent when so much obliged Would you refuse me the pleasure of being grateful of adding my thanks to my Olivia's of sharing in the transports that you have thus occasioned  CROAKER  Lord sir we can be happy enough without your coming in to make up the party I don't know what's  the matter with the boy all this day he has got into such a rhodomontade manner all this morning  LEONTINE  But sir I that have so large a part in the benefit is it not my duty to shew my joy Is the being admitted to your favour so slight an obligation Is the happiness of marrying my Olivia so small a blessing  CROAKER  Marrying Olivia marrying Olivia marrying his own sister Sure the boy is out of his senses His own sister  LEONTINE  My sister  OLIVIA  Sister How have I been mistaken    Aside  LEONTINE  Some curs'd mistake in all this I find    Aside  CROAKER  What does the booby mean or has he any meaning Eh what do you mean you blockhead you  LEONTINE  Mean sirwhy sironly when my sister is to be married that I have the pleasure of marrying her sir that is of giving her away sirI have made a point of it  CROAKER  O is that all Give her away You have made a point of it Then you had as good make a point of first giving away yourself as I'm going to prepare the writings between you and miss Richland this very minute What a fuss is here about nothing Why what's the matter now I thought I had made you at least as happy as you could wish  OLIVIA  O yes sir very happy  CROAKER  Do you foresee any thing child You look as if you did I think if any thing was to be foreseen I have as sharp a look out as another and yet I foresee nothing    Exit  LEONTINE OLIVIA  OLIVIA  What can it mean  LEONTINE  He knows something and yet for my life I can't tell what  OLIVIA  It can't be the connexion between us I'm pretty certain  LEONTINE  Whatever it be my dearest I'm resolv'd to put it out of fortune's power to repeat our mortification I'll haste and prepare for our journey to Scotland this very evening My friend Honeywood has promis'd me his advice and assistance I'll go to him and repose our distresses on his friendly bosom and I know so much of his honest heart that if he can't relieve our uneasinesses he will at least share them    Exeunt  ACT THE THIRD  SCENE YOUNG HONEYWOOD'S house  BAILIFF HONEYWOOD FOLLOWER  BAILIFF  LOOKY sir I have arrested as good men as you in my time no disparagement of you neither Men that would go forty guineas on a game of cribbage I challenge the town to shew a man in more genteeler practice than myself  HONEYWOOD  Without all question Mr I forget your name sir  BAILIFF  How can you forget what you never knew he he he  HONEYWOOD  May I beg leave to ask your name  BAILIFF  Yes you may  HONEYWOOD  Then pray sir what is your name sir  BAILIFF  That I didn't promise to tell you He he he A joke breaks no bones as we say among us that practice the law  HONEYWOOD  You may have reason for keeping it a secret perhaps  BAILIFF  The law does nothing without reason I'm asham'd to tell my name to no man sir If you can shew cause as why upon a special capus that I should prove my nameBut come Timothy Twitch is my name And now you know my name what have you to say to that  HONEYWOOD  Nothing in the world good Mr Twitch but that I have a favour to ask that's all  BAILIFF  Ay favours are more easily asked than granted as we say among us that practice the law I have taken an oath against granting favours Would you have me perjure myself  HONEYWOOD  But my request will come recommended in so strong a manner as I believe you'll have no scruple    pulling out his purse    The thing is only this I believe I shall be able to discharge this trifle in two or three days at farthest but as I would not have the affair known for the world I have thoughts of keeping you and your good friend here about me till the debt is discharged for which I shall be properly grateful  BAILIFF  Oh that's another maxum and altogether within my oath For certain if an honest man is to get any thing by a thing there's no reason why all things should not be done in civility  HONEYWOOD  Doubtless all trades must live Mr Twitch and yours is a necessary one    Gives him money    BAILIFF  Oh your honour I hope your honour takes nothing amiss as I does as I does nothing but my duty in so doing I'm sure no man can say I ever give a gentleman that was a gentleman ill usage If I saw that a gentleman was a gentleman I have taken money not to see him for ten weeks together  HONEYWOOD  Tenderness is a virtue Mr Twitch  BAILIFF  Ay sir it's a perfect treasure I love to see a gentleman with a tender heart I don't know but I think I have a tender heart myself If all that I have lost by my heart was put together it would make abut no matter for that  HONEYWOOD  Don't account it lost Mr Twitch The ingratitude of the world can never deprive us of the conscious happiness of having acted with humanity ourselves  BAILIFF  Humanity sir is a jewel It's better than gold I love humanity People may say that we in our way have no humanity but I'll shew you my humanity this moment There's my follower here little Flanigan with a wife and four children a guinea or two would be more to him than twice as much to another Now as I can't shew him any humanity myself I must beg leave you'll do it for me  HONEYWOOD  I assure you Mr Twitch yours is a most powerful recommendation    giving money to the follower    BAILIFF  Sir you're a gentleman I see you know what to do with your money But to business we are to be  with you here as your friends I suppose But  et in case company comesLittle Flanigan here to be sure has a good face a very good face but then he is a little seedy as we say among us that practise the law Not well in cloaths Smoke the pocketholes  HONEYWOOD  Well that shall be remedied without delay  Enter SERVANT  SERVANT  Sir miss Richland is below  HONEYWOOD  How unlucky Detain her a moment We must improve my good friend little Mr Flanigan's appearance first Here let Mr Flanigan have a suit of my cloathsquickthe brown and silverDo you hear  SERVANT  That your honour gave away to the begging gentleman that makes verses because it was as good as new  HONEYWOOD  The white and gold then  SERVANT  That your honour I made bold to sell because it was good for nothing  HONEYWOOD  Well the first that comes to hand then The blue and gold then I believe Mr Flanigan will look best in blue    Exit  Flanigan  BAILIFF  Rabbit me but little Flanigan will look well in any thing Ah if your honour knew that bit of flesh as well as I do you'd be perfectly in love with him  There's not a prettier scout in the four counties after a shycock than he scents like a hound sticks like a weazle He was master of the ceremonies to the black queen of Morocco when I took him to follow me    Reenter  Flanigan  Heh ecod I think he looks so well that I don't care if I have a suit from the same place for myself  HONEYWOOD  Well well I hear the lady coming Dear Mr Twitch I beg you'll give your friend directions not to speak As for yourself I know you will say nothing without being directed  BAILIFF  Never you fear me I'll shew the lady that I have something to say for myself as well as another One man has one way of talking and another man has another that's all the difference between them  Enter MISS RICHLAND and her MAID  MISS RICHLAND  You'll be surprised sir with this visit But you know I'm yet to thank you for chusing my little library  HONEYWOOD  Thanks madam are unnecessary as it was I that was obliged by your commands Chairs here Two of my very good friends Mr Twitch and Mr Flanigan Pray gentlemen sit without ceremony  MISS RICHLAND  Who can these oddlooking men be I fear it is as I was informed It must be so    Aside  BAILIFF after a pause  Pretty weather very pretty weather for the time of the year madam  FOLLOWER  Very good circuit weather in the country  HONEYWOOD  You officers are generally favourites among the ladies My friends madam have been upon very disagreeable duty I assure you The fair should in some measure recompence the toils of the brave  MISS RICHLAND  Our officers do indeed deserve every favour The gentlemen are in the marine service I presume sir  HONEYWOOD  Why madam they dooccasionally serve in the fleet madam A dangerous service  MISS RICHLAND  I'm told so And I own it has often surprised me that while we have had so many instances of bravery there we have had so few of wit at home to praise it  HONEYWOOD  I grant madam that our poets have not written as our soldiers have fought but they have done all they could and Hawke or Amherst could do no more  MISS RICHLAND  I'm quite displeased when I see a fine subject spoiled by a dull writer  HONEYWOOD  We should not be so severe against dull writers madam It is ten to one but the dullest writer exceeds the most rigid French critic who presumes to despise him  FOLLOWER  Damn the French the parle vous and all that belongs to them  MISS RICHLAND  Sir  HONEYWOOD  Ha ha ha honest Mr Flanigan A true English officer madam he's not contented with beating the French but he will scold them too  MISS RICHLAND  Yet Mr Honeywood this does not convince me but that severity in criticism is necessary It was our first adopting the severity of French taste that has brought them in turn to taste us  BAILIFF  Taste us By the Lord madam they devour us Give monseers but a taste and I'll be damn'd but they come in for a bellyful  MISS RICHLAND  Very extraordinary this  FOLLOWER  But very true What makes the bread rising the parle vous that devour us What makes the mutton fivepence a pound the parle vous that eat it up What makes the beer threepencehalfpenny a pot  HONEYWOOD  Ah the vulgar rogues all will be out    Aside    Right gentlemen very right upon my word and quite to the purpose They draw a parallel madam between the mental taste and that of our senses We are injured as much by French severity in the one as by French rapacity in the other That's their meaning  MISS RICHLAND  Tho' I don't see the force of the parallel yet I'll own that we should sometimes pardon books as we do our friends that have now and then agreeable abfurdities to recommend them  BAILIFF  That's all my eye The king only can pardon as the law says for set in case  HONEYWOOD  I'm quite of your opinion sir I see the whole drift of your argument Yes certainly our presuming to pardon any work is arrogating a power that belongs to another If all have power to condemn what writer can be free  BAILIFF  By his habus corpus His habus corpus can set him free at any time for set in case  HONEYWOOD  I'm obliged to you sir for the hint If madam as my friend observes our laws are so careful of a gentleman's person sure we ought to be equally careful of his dearer part his fame  FOLLOWER  Ay but if so be a man's nabb'd you know  HONEYWOOD  Mr Flanigan if you spoke for ever you could not improve the last observation For my own part I think it conclusive  BAILIFF  As for the matter of that mayhap  HONEYWOOD  Nay sir give me leave in this instance to be positive For where is the necessity of censuring works without genius which must shortly sink of themselves what is it but aiming our unnecessary blow against a victim already under the hands of justice  BAILIFF  Justice O by the elevens if you talk about justice I think I am at home there for in a course of law  HONEYWOOD  My dear Mr Twitch I discern what you'd be at perfectly and I believe the lady must be sensible of the art with which it is introduced I suppose you perceive the meaning madam of his course of law  MISS RICHLAND  I protest sir I do not I perceive only that you answer one gentleman before he has finished and the other before he has well begun  BAILIFF  Madam you are a gentlewoman and I will make the matter out This here question is about severity and justice and pardon and the like of they Now to explain the thing  HONEYWOOD  O curse your explanations    Aside  Enter SERVANT  SERVANT  Mr Leontine sir below desires to speak with you upon earnest business  HONEYWOOD  That's lucky    Aside    Dear madam you'll excuse me and my good friends here for a few minutes There are books madam to amuse you Come gentlemen you know I make no ceremony with such friends After you sir Excuse me Well if I must But I know your natural politeness  BAILIFF  Before and behind you know  FOLLOWER  Ay ay before and behind before and behind    Exeunt  Honeywood Bailiff  and  Follower  MISS RICHLAND  What can all this mean Garnet  GARNET  Mean madam why what should it mean but what Mr Lofty sent you here to see These people he calls officers are officers sure enough sheriff's officers bailiffs madam  MISS RICHLAND  Ay it is certainly so Well tho' his perplexities are far from giving me pleasure yet I own there's something very ridiculous in them and a just punishment for his dissimulation  GARNET  And so they are But I wonder madam that the lawyer you just employed to pay his debts and set him free has not done it by this time He ought at least to have been here before now But lawyers are always more ready to get a man into troubles than out of them  Enter SIR WILLIAM  SIR WILLIAM  For miss Richland to undertake setting him free I own was quite unexpected It has totally unhinged my schemes to reclaim him Yet it gives me pleasure to find that among a number of worthless friendships he has made one acquisition of real value for there must be some softer passion on her side that prompts this generosity Ha here before me I'll endeavour to sound her affections Madam as I am the person that have had some demands upon the gentleman of this house I hope you'll excuse me if before I enlarged him I wanted to see yourself  MISS RICHLAND  The precaution was very unnecessary sir I suppose your wants were only such as my agent had power to satisfy  SIR WILLIAM  Partly madam But I was also willing you should be fully apprized of the character of the gentleman you intended to serve  MISS RICHLAND  It must come sir with a very ill grace from you To censure it after what you have done would look like malice and to speak favourably of a character you have oppressed would be impeaching your own And sure his tenderness his humanity his universal friendship may atone for many faults  SIR WILLIAM  That friendship madam which is exerted in too wide a sphere becomes totally useless Our bounty like a drop of water disappears when diffused too widely They who pretend most to this universal benevolence are either deceivers or dupes Men who desire to cover their private illnature by a pretended regard for all or men who reasoning themselves into false feelings are more earnest in pursuit of splendid than of useful virtues  MISS RICHLAND  I am surprised sir to hear one who has probably been a gainer by the folly of others so severe in his censure of it  SIR WILLIAM  Whatever I may have gained by folly madam you see I am willing to prevent your losing by it  MISS RICHLAND  Your cares for me sir are unnecessary I always suspect those services which are denied where they are wanted and offered perhaps in hopes of a refusal No sir my directions have been given and I insist upon their being complied with  SIR WILLIAM  Thou amiable woman I can no longer contain the expressions of my gratitude my pleasure You see before you one who has been equally careful of his interest one who has for some time been a concealed spectator of his follies and only punished in hopes to reclaim themhis uncle  MISS RICHLAND  Sir William Honeywood You amaze me How shall I conceal my confusion I fear sir you'll think I have been too forward in my services I confess I  SIR WILLIAM  Don't make any apologies madam I only find myself unable to repay the obligation And yet I have been trying my interest of late to serve you Having learnt madam that you had some demands upon government I have tho' unasked been your solicitor there  MISS RICHLAND  Sir I'm infinitely obliged to your intentions But my guardian has employed another gentleman who assures him of success  SIR WILLIAM  Who the important little man that visits here Trust me madam he's quite contemptible among men in power and utterly unable to serve you Mr Lofty's promises are much better known to people of fashion than his person I assure you  MISS RICHLAND  How have we been deceived As sure as can be here he comes  SIR WILLIAM  Does he Remember I'm to continue unknown My return to England has not as yet been made public With what impudence he enters  Enter LOFTY  LOFTY  Let the chariotlet my chariot drive off I'll visit to his grace's in a chair Miss Richland here before me Punctual as usual to the calls of humanity I'm very sorry madam things of this kind should happen especially to a man I have shewn every where and carried amongst us as a particular acquaintance  MISS RICHLAND  I find sir you have the art of making the misfortunes of others your own  LOFTY  My dear madam what can a private man like me do One man can't do every thing and then I do so much in this way every day let me see something considerable might be done for him by subscription it could not fail if I carried the list I'll undertake to set down a brace of dukes two dozen lords and half the lower house at my own peril  SIR WILLIAM  And after all it's more than probable sir he might reject the offer of such powerful patronage  LOFTY  Then madam what can we do You know I never make promises In truth I once or twice tried to do something with him in the way of business but as I often told his uncle sir William Honeywood the man was utterly impracticable  SIR WILLIAM  His uncle Then that gentleman I suppose is a particular friend of your  LOFTY  Meaning me sirYes madam as I often said my dear sir William you are sensible I would do any thing as far as my poor interest goes to serve your family but what can be done there's no procuring firstrate places for ninthrate abilities  MISS RICHLAND  I have heard of sir William Honeywood he's abroad in employment he confided in your judgment I suppose  LOFTY  Why yes madam I believe sir William had some reason to confide in my judgment one little reason perhaps  MISS RICHLAND  Pray sir what was it  LOFTY  Why madambut let it go no furtherit was I procured him his place  SIR WILLIAM  Did you sir  LOFTY  Either you or I sir  MISS RICHLAND  This Mr Lofty was very kind indeed  LOFTY  I did love him to be sure he had some amusing qualities no man was fitter to be toastmaster to a club or had a better head  MISS RICHLAND  A better head  LOFTY  Ay at a bottle To be sure he was as dull as a choice spirit but hang it he was grateful very grateful and gratitude hides a multitude of faults  SIR WILLIAM  He might have reason perhaps His place is pretty considerable I'm told  LOFTY  A trifle a mere trifle among us men of business The truth is he wanted dignity to fill up a greater  SIR WILLIAM  Dignity of person do you mean sir I'm told he's much about my size and figure sir  LOFTY  Ay tall enough for a marching regiment but then he wanted a somethinga consequence of forma kind of aI believe the lady perceives my meaning  MISS RICHLAND  O perfectly you courtiers can do any thing I see  LOFTY  My dear madam all this is but a meer exchange we do greater things for one another every day Why as thus now let me suppose you the first lord of the treasury you have an employment in you that I want I have a place in me that you want do me here do you there interest of both sides few words flat done and done and its over  SIR WILLIAM  A thought strikes me    Aside    Now you mention sir William Honeywood madam and as he seems sir an acquaintance of yours you'll be glad to hear he's arrived from Italy I had it from a friend who knows him as well as he does me and you may depend on my information  LOFTY  The devil he is If I had known that we should not have been quite so well acquainted    Aside  SIR WILLIAM  He is certainly returned and as this gentleman is a friend of yours he can be of signal service to us by introducing me to him there are some papers relative to your affairs that require dispatch and his inspection  MISS RICHLAND  This gentleman Mr Lofty is a person employed in my affairs I know you'll serve us  LOFTY  My dear madam I live but to serve you Sir William shall even wait upon him if you think proper to command it  SIR WILLIAM  That would be quite unnecessary  LOFTY  Well we must introduce you then Call upon melet me seeay in two days  SIR WILLIAM  Now or the opportunity will be lost for ever  LOFTY  Well if it must be now now let it be But damn it that's unfortunate my lord Grig's cursed Pensacola business comes on this very hour and I'm engaged to attendanother time  SIR WILLIAM  A short letter to sir William will do  LOFTY  You shall have it yet in my opinion a letter is a very bad way of going to work face to face that's my way  SIR WILLIAM  The letter sir will do quite as well  LOFTY  Zounds sir do you pretend to direct me direct me in the business of office Do you know me sir who am I  MISS RICHLAND  Dear Mr Lofty this request is not so much his as mine if my commandsbut you despise my power  LOFTY  Delicate creature your commands could even controul a debate at midnight to a power so constitutional I am all obedience and tranquillity He shall have a letter where is my secretary Dubardieu And yet I protest I don't like this way of doing business I think if I spoke first to sir WilliamBut you will have it so    Exit with Miss  Richland  SIR WILLIAM  alone  Ha ha ha This too is one of my nephew's hopeful associates O vanity thou constant deceiver how do all thy efforts to exalt serve but to sink us Thy false colourings like those employed to heighten beauty only seem to mend that bloom which they contribute to destroy I'm not displeased at this interview exposing this fellow's impudence to the contempt it deserves may be of use to my design at least if he can reflect it will be of use to himself  Enter JARVIS  SIR WILLIAM  How now Jarvis where's your master my nephew  JARVIS  At his wit's end I believe he's scarce gotten out of one scrape but he's running his head into another  SIR WILLIAM  How so  JARVIS  The house has but just been cleared of the bailiffs and now he's again engaging tooth and nail in assisting old Croaker's son to patch up a clandestine match with the young lady that passes in the house for his sister  SIR WILLIAM  Ever busy to serve others  JARVIS  Ay any body but himself The young couple it seems are just setting out for Scotland and he supplies them with money for the journey  SIR WILLIAM  Money how is he able to supply others who has scarce any for himself  JARVIS  Why there it is he has no money that's true but then as he never said no to any request in his life he has given them a bill drawn by a friend of his upon a merchant in the city which I am to get changed for you must know that I am to go with them to Scotland myself  SIR WILLIAM  How  JARVIS  It seems the young gentleman is obliged to take a different road from his mistress as he is to call upon an uncle of his that lives out of the way in order to prepare a place for their reception when they return so they have borrowed me from my master as the properest person to attend the young lady down  SIR WILLIAM  To the land of matrimony A pleasant journey Jarvis  JARVIS  Ay but I'm only to have all the fatigues on't  SIR WILLIAM  Well it may be shorter and less fatiguing than you imagine I know but too much of the young lady's family and connexions whom I have seen abroad I have also discovered that miss Richland is not indifferent to my thoughtless nephew and will endeavour tho' I fear in vain to establish that connexion But come the letter I wait for must be almost finished I'll let you further into my intentions in the next room    Exeunt  ACT THE FOURTH  SCENE CROAKER'S house  LOFTY  WELL sure the devil's in me of late for running my head into such defiles as nothing but a genius like my own could draw me from I was formerly contented to husband out my places and pensions with some degree of frugality but curse it of late I have given away the whole Court Register in less time than they could print the title page yet hang it why scruple a lie or two to come at a fine girl when I every day tell a thousand for nothing Ha Honeywood here before me Could miss Richland have set him at liberty  Enter HONEYWOOD  Mr Honeywood I'm glad to see you abroad again I find my concurrence was not necessary in your unfortunate affairs I had put things in a train to do your business but it is not for me to say what I intended doing  HONEYWOOD  It was unfortunate indeed sir But what adds to my uneasiness is that while you seem to be acquainted with my misfortune I myself continue still a stranger to my benefactor  LOFTY  How not know the friend that served you  HONEYWOOD  Can't guess at the person  LOFTY  Inquire  HONEYWOOD  I have but all I can learn is that he chuses to remain concealed and that all inquiry must be fruitless  LOFTY  Must be fruitless  HONEYWOOD  Absolutely fruitless  LOFTY  Sure of that  HONEYWOOD  Very sure  LOFTY  Then I'll be damn'd if you shall ever know it from me  HONEYWOOD  How sir  LOFTY  I suppose now Mr Honeywood you think my rentroll very considerable and that I have vast sums of money to throw away I know you do The world to be sure says such things of me  HONEYWOOD  The world by what I learn is no stranger to your generosity But where does this tend  LOFTY  To nothing nothing in the world The town to be sure when it makes such a thing as me the subject of conversation has asserted that I never yet patronized a man of merit  HONEYWOOD  I have heard instances to the contrary even from yourself  LOFTY  Yes Honeywood and there are instances to the contrary that you shall never hear from myself  HONEYWOOD  Ha dear sir permit me to ask you but one question  LOFTY  Sir ask me no questions I say sir ask me no questions I'll be damn'd if I answer them  HONEYWOOD  I will ask no further My friend my benefactor it is it must be here that I am indebted for freedom for honour Yes thou worthiest of men from the beginning I suspected it but was afraid to return thanks which if undeserved might seem reproaches  LOFTY  I protest I don't understand all this Mr Honeywood You treat me very cavalierly I do assure you sirBlood sir can't a man be permitted to enjoy the luxury of his own feelings without all this parade  HONEYWOOD  Nay do not attempt to conceal an action that adds to your honour Your looks your air your manner all confess it  LOFTY  Confess it sir Torture itself sir shall never bring me to confess it Mr Honeywood I have  admitted you upon terms of friendship Don't let us fall out make me happy and let this be buried in oblivion You know I hate ostentation you know I do Come come Honeywood you know I always loved to be a friend and not a patron I beg this may make no kind of distance between us Come come you and I must be more familiarIndeed we must  HONEYWOOD  Heavens Can I ever repay such friendship Is there any way Thou best of men can I ever return the obligation  LOFTY  A bagatelle a mere bagatelle But I see your heart is labouring to be grateful You shall be grateful It would be cruel to disappoint you  HONEYWOOD  How Teach me the manner Is there any way  LOFTY  From this moment you're mine Yes my friend you shall know itI'm in love  HONEYWOOD  And can I assist you  LOFTY  Nobody so well  HONEYWOOD  In what manner I'm all impatience  LOFTY  You shall make love for me  HONEYWOOD  And to whom shall I speak in your favour  LOFTY  To a lady with whom you have great interest I assure you miss Richland  HONEYWOOD  Miss Richland  LOFTY  Yes miss Richland She has struck the blow up to the hilt in my bosom by Jupiter  HONEYWOOD  Heavens was ever any thing more unfortunate It is too much to be endured  LOFTY  Unfortunate indeed And yet I can endure it till you have opened the affair to her for me Between ourselves I think she likes me I'm not apt to boast but I think she does  HONEYWOOD  Indeed But do you know the person you apply to  LOFTY  Yes I know you are her friend and mine that's enough To you therefore I commit the success of my passion I'll say no more let friendship do the rest I have only to add that if at any time my little interest can be of servicebut hang it I'll make no promisesyou know my interest is yours at any time No apologies my friend I'll not be answered it shall be so    Exit  HONEYWOOD  Open generous unsuspecting man He little thinks that I love her too and with such an ardent passionBut then it was ever but a vain and hopeless one my torment my persecution What shall I do Love friendship a hopeless passion a deserving friend Love that has been my tormentor a friend that has perhaps distressed himself to serve me It shall be so Yes I will discard the fondling hope  from my bosom and exert all my influence in his favour And yet to see her in the possession of anotherInsupportable But then to betray a generous trusting friendWorse worse Yes I'm resolved Let me but be the instrument of their happiness and then quit a country where I must for ever despair of finding my own    Exit  Enter OLIVIA and GARNET who carries a milliner's box  OLIVIA  Dear me I wish this journey were over No news of Jarvis yet I believe the old peevish creature delays purely to vex me  GARNET  Why to be sure madam I did hear him say a little snubbing before marriage would teach you to bear it the better afterwards  OLIVIA  To be gone a full hour tho' he had only to get a bill changed in the city How provoking  GARNET  I'll lay my life Mr Leontine that had twice as much to do is setting off by this time from his inn and here you are left behind  OLIVIA  Well let us be prepared for his coming however Are you sure you have omitted nothing Garnet  GARNET  Not a stick madamall's here Yet I wish you could take the white and silver to be married in It's the worst luck in the world in any thing but white I knew one Bett Stubbs of our town that was  married in red and as sure as eggs is eggs the bridegroom and she had a miff before morning  OLIVIA  No matter I'm all impatience till we are out of the house  GARNET  Bless me madam I had almost forgot the weddingringThe sweet little thingI don't think it would go on my little finger And what if I put in a gentleman's nightcap in case of necessity madam But here's Jarvis  Enter JARVIS  OLIVIA  O Jarvis are you come at last We have been ready this half hour Now let's be going Let us fly  JARVIS  Aye to Jericho for we shall have no going to Scotland this bout I fancy  OLIVIA  How What's the matter  JARVIS  Money money is the matter madam We have got no money What the plague do you send me of your fool's errand for My master's bill upon the city is not worth a rush Here it is Mrs Garnet may pin up her hair with it  OLIVIA  Undone How could Honeywood serve us so What shall we do Can't we go without it  JARVIS  Go to Scotland without money To Scotland without money Lord how some people understand  geography We might as well set sail for Patagonia upon a cork jacket  OLIVIA  Such a disappointment What a base insincere man was your master to serve us in this manner Is this his good nature  JARVIS  Nay don't talk ill of my master madam I won't bear to hear any body talk ill of him but myself  GARNET  Bless us now I think on't madam you need not be under any uneasiness I saw Mr Leontine receive forty guineas from his father just before he set out and he can't yet have left the inn A short letter will reach him there  OLIVIA  Well remember'd Garnet I'll write immediately How's this Bless me my hand trembles so I can't write a word Do you write Garnet and upon second thought it will be better from you  GARNET  Truly madam I write and indite but poorly I never was kute at my larning But I'll do what I can to please you Let me see All out of my own head I suppose  OLIVIA  Whatever you please  GARNET    Writing    Muster CroakerTwenty guineas madam  OLIVIA  Ay twenty will do  GARNET  At the bar of the Talbot till call'd for Expeditionwill be blown upAll of a flameQuick  dispatchCupid the little god of loveI conclude it madam with Cupid I love to see a loveletter end like poetry  OLIVIA  Well well what you please any thing But how shall we send it I can trust none of the servants of this family  GARNET  Odso madam Mr Honeywood's butler is in the next room he's a dear sweet man he'll do any thing for me  JARVIS  He the dog he'll certainly commit some blunder He's drunk and sober ten times a day  OLIVIA  No matter Fly Garnet any body we can trust will do    Exit  Garnet  Well Jarvis now we can have nothing more to interrupt us You may take up the things and carry them on to the inn Have you no hands Jarvis  JARVIS  Soft and fair young lady You that are going to be married think things can never be done too fast but we that are old and know what we are about must elope methodically madam  OLIVIA  Well sure if my indiscretions were to be done over again  JARVIS  My life for it you would do them ten times over  OLIVIA  Why will you talk so If you knew how unhappy they make me  JARVIS  Very unhappy no doubt I was once just as unhappy when I was going to be married myself I'll tell you a story about that  OLIVIA  A story when I'm all impatience to be away Was there ever such a dilatory creature  JARVIS  Well madam if we must march why we will march that's all Tho' odds bobs we have still forgot one thing we should never travel withouta case of good razors and a box of shavingpowder But no matter I believe we shall be pretty well shaved by the way    Going  Enter GARNET  GARNET  Undone undone madam Ah Mr Jarvis you said right enough As sure as death Mr Honeywood's rogue of a drunken butler dropp'd the letter before he went ten yards from the door There's old Croaker has just pick'd it up and is this moment reading it to himself in the hall  OLIVIA  Unfortunate We shall be discover'd  GARNET  No madam don't be uneasy he can make neither head nor tail of it To be sure he looks as if he was broke loose from Bedlam about it but he can't find what it means for all that O lud he is coming this way all in the horrors  OLIVIA  Then let us leave the house this instant for fear he should ask farther questions In the mean time Garnet do you write and send off just such another    Exeunt  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  Death and destruction Are all the horrors of air fire and water to be levelled only at me Am I only to be singled out for gunpowderplots combustibles and conflagration Here it isAn incendiary letter dropp'd at my door 'To Muster Croaker these with speed' Ay ay plain enough the direction all in the genuine incendiary spelling and as cramp as the devil 'With speed' O confound your speed But let me read it once more    Reads    'Muster Croaker as as sone as yoew see this leve twenty gunnes at the bar of the Talboot tell caled for or yowe and yower experetion will be al blown up' Ah but too plain Blood and gunpowder in every line of it Blown up murderous dog All blown up Heavens what have I and my poor family done to be all blown up    Reads    'Our pockets are low and money we must have' Ay there's the reason they'll blow us up because they have got low pockets    Reads    'It is but a short time you have to consider for if this takes wind the house will quickly be all of a flame' Inhuman monsters blow us up and then burn us The earthquake at Lisbon was but a bonfire to it    Reads    'Make quick dispatch and so no more at present But may Cupid the little god of love go with you wherever you go' The little god of love Cupid  the little god of love go with me Go you to the devil you and your little Cupid together I'm so frightened I scarce know whether I sit stand or go Perhaps this moment I'm treading on lighted matches blazing brimstone and barrels of gunpowder They are preparing to blow me up into the clouds Murder We shall be all burnt in our beds we shall be all burnt in our beds  Enter MISS RICHLAND  MISS RICHLAND  Lord sir what's the matter  CROAKER  Murder's the matter We shall be all blown up in our beds before morning  MISS RICHLAND  I hope not sir  CROAKER  What signifies what you hope madam when I have a certificate of it here in my hand Will nothing alarm my family Sleeping and eating sleeping and eating is the only work from morning till night in my house My insensible crew could sleep tho' rock'd by an earthquake and fry beef steaks at a volcano  MISS RICHLAND  But sir you have alarmed them so often already we have nothing but earthquakes famines plagues and mad dogs from year's end to year's end You remember sir it is not above a month ago you assur'd us of a conspiracy among the bakers to poison us in our bread and so kept the whole family a week upon potatoes  CROAKER  And potatoes were too good for them But why do I stand talking here with a girl when I should be facing the enemy without Here John Nicodemus search the house Look into the cellars to see if there be any combustibles below and above in the apartments that no matches be thrown in at the windows Let all the fires be put out and let the engine be drawn out in the yard to play upon the house in case of necessity    Exit  MISS RICHLAND alone  What can he mean by all this Yet why should I inquire when he alarms us in this manner almost every day But Honeywood has desired an interview with me in private What can he mean or rather what means this palpitation at his approach It is the first time he ever shewed any thing in his conduct that seemed particular Sure he cannot mean tobut he's here  Enter HONEYWOOD  HONEYWOOD  I presumed to solicit this interview madam before I left town to be permitted  MISS RICHLAND  Indeed Leaving town sir  HONEYWOOD  Yes madam perhaps the kingdom I have presumed I say to desire the favour of this interviewin order to disclose something which our long friendship prompts And yet my fears  MISS RICHLAND  His fears What are his fears to mine    Aside    We have indeed been long acquainted sir very long If I remember our first meeting was at the French ambassador'sDo you recollect how you were pleased to rally me upon my complexion there  HONEYWOOD  Perfectly madam I presumed to reprove you for painting but your warmer blushes soon convinced the company that the colouring was all from nature  MISS RICHLAND  And yet you only meant it in your goodnatured way to make me pay a compliment to myself In the same manner you danced that night with the most aukward woman in company because you saw nobody else would take her out  HONEYWOOD  Yes and was rewarded the next night by dancing with the finest woman in company whom every body wished to take out  MISS RICHLAND  Well sir if you thought so then I fear your judgment has since corrected the errors of a first impression We generally shew to most advantage at first Our sex are like poor tradesmen that put all their best goods to be seen at the windows  HONEYWOOD  The first impression madam did indeed deceive me I expected to find a woman with all the faults of conscious flattered beauty I expected to find her vain and insolent But every day has since taught me that it is possible to possess sense without pride and beauty without affectation  MISS RICHLAND  This sir is a style very unsual with Mr Honeywood and I should be glad to know why he thus attempts to encrease that vanity which his own lessons have taught me to despise  HONEYWOOD  I ask pardon madam Yet from our long friendship I presumed I might have some right to offer without offence what you may refuse without offending  MISS RICHLAND  Sir I beg you'd reflect tho' I fear I shall scarce have any power to refuse a request of yours yet you may be precipitate consider sir  HONEYWOOD  I own my rashness but as I plead the cause of friendship of one who lovesDon't be alarmed madamwho loves you with the most ardent passion whose whole happiness is placed in you  MISS RICHLAND  I fear sir I shall never find whom you mean by this description of him  HONEYWOOD  Ah madam it but too plainly points him out tho' he should be too humble himself to urge his pretensions or you too modest to understand them  MISS RICHLAND  Well it would be affectation any longer to pretend ignorance and I will own sir I have long been prejudiced in his favour It was but natural to wish to make his heart mine as he seemed himself ignorant of its value  HONEYWOOD  I see she always loved him    Aside    I find madam you're already sensible of his worth his passion How  happy is my friend to be the favourite of one with such sense to distinguish merit and such beauty to reward it  MISS RICHLAND  Your friend sir What friend  HONEYWOOD  My best friendmy friend Mr Lofty madam  MISS RICHLAND  He sir  HONEYWOOD  Yes he madam He is indeed what your warmest wishes might have formed him And to his other qualities he adds that of the most passionate regard for you  MISS RICHLAND  AmazementNo more of this I beg you sir  HONEYWOOD  I see your confusion madam and know how to interpret it And since I so plainly read the language of your heart shall I make my friend happy by communicating your sentiments  MISS RICHLAND  By no means  HONEYWOOD  Excuse me I must I know you desire it  MISS RICHLAND  Mr Honeywood let me tell you that you wrong my sentiments and yourself When I first applied to your friendship I expected advice and assistance but now sir I see that it is vain to expect happiness from him who has been so bad an oeconomist of his own and that I must disclaim his friendship who ceases to be a friend to himself    Exit  HONEYWOOD  How is this she has confessed she loved him and yet she seemed to part in displeasure Can I have done any thing to reproach myself with No I believe not yet after all these things should not be done by a third person I should have spared her confusion My friendship carried me a little too far  Enter CROAKER with the letter in his hand and MRS CROAKER  MRS CROAKER  Ha ha ha And so my dear it's your supreme wish that I should be quite wretched upon this occasion ha ha  CROAKER mimicking  Ha ha ha and so my dear it's your supreme pleasure to give me no better consolation  MRS CROAKER  Positively my dear what is this incendiary stuff and trumpery to me Our house may travel thro' the air like the house of Loretto for aught I care if I'm to be miserable in it  CROAKER  Would to heaven it were converted into an house of correction for your benefit Have we not every thing to alarm us Perhaps this very moment the tragedy is beginning  MRS CROAKER  Then let us reserve our distress till the rising of the curtain or give them the money they want and have done with them  CROAKER  Give them my moneyAnd pray what right have they to my money  MRS CROAKER  And pray what right then have you to my good humour  CROAKER  And so your good humour advises me to part with my money Why then to tell your good humour a piece of my mind I'd sooner part with my wife Here's Mr Honeywood see what he'll say to it My dear Honeywood look at this incendiary letter dropped at my door It will freeze you with terror and yet lovey here can read itcan read it and laugh  MRS CROAKER  Yes and so will Mr Honeywood  CROAKER  If he does I'll suffer to be hanged the next minute in the rogue's place that's all  MRS CROAKER  Speak Mr Honeywood is there any thing more foolish than my husband's fright upon this occasion  HONEYWOOD  It would not become me to decide madam but doubtless the greatness of his terrors now will but invite them to renew their villainy another time  MRS CROAKER  I told you he'd be of my opinion  CROAKER  How sir do you maintain that I should lie down under such an injury and shew neither by my tears or complaints that I have something of the spirit of a man in me  HONEYWOOD  Pardon me sir You ought to make the loudest complaints if you desire redress The surest way to have redress is to be earnest in the pursuit of it  CROAKER  Ay whose opinion is he of now  MRS CROAKER  But don't you think that laughing off our fears is the best way  HONEYWOOD  What is the best madam few can say but I'll maintain it to be a very wise way  CROAKER  But we're talking of the best Surely the best way is to face the enemy in the field and not wait till he plunders us in our very bedchamber  HONEYWOOD  Why sir as to the best thatthat's a very wise way too  MRS CROAKER  But can any thing be more absurd than to double our distresses by our apprehensions and put it in the power of every low fellow that can scrawl ten words of wretched spelling to torment us  HONEYWOOD  Without doubt nothing more absurd  CROAKER  How would it not be more absurd to despise the rattle till we are bit by the snake  HONEYWOOD  Without doubt perfectly absurd  CROAKER  Then you are of my opinion  HONEYWOOD  Entirely  MRS CROAKER  And you reject mine  HONEYWOOD  Heavens forbid madam No sure no reasoning can be more just than yours We ought certainly to despise malice if we cannot oppose it and not make the incendiary's pen as fatal to our repose as the highwayman's pistol  MRS CROAKER  O then you think I'm quite right  HONEYWOOD  Perfectly right  CROAKER  A plague of plagues we can't be both right I ought to be sorry or I ought to be glad My hat must be on my head or my hat must be off  MRS CROAKER  Certainly in two opposite opinions if one be perfectly reasonable the other can't be perfectly right  HONEYWOOD  And why may not both be right madam Mr Croaker in earnestly seeking redress and you in waiting the event with good humour Pray let me see the letter again I have it This letter requires twenty guineas to be left at the bar of the Talbot inn If it be indeed an incendiary letter what if you and I sir go there and when the writer comes to be paid his expected booty seize him  CROAKER  My dear friend it's the very thing the very thing While I walk by the door you shall plant yourself in ambush near the bar burst out upon the miscreant like a masqued battery extort a confession at once and so hang him up by surprise  HONEYWOOD  Yes but I would not chuse to exercise too much severity It is my maxim sir that crimes generally punish themselves  CROAKER  Well but we may upbraid him a little I suppose    Ironically  HONEYWOOD  Ay but not punish him too rigidly  CROAKER  Well well leave that to my own benevolence  HONEYWOOD  Well I do but remember that universal benevolence is the first law of nature    Exeunt  Honeywood  and  Mrs Croaker  CROAKER  Yes and my universal benevolence will hang the dog if he had as many necks as a hydra  ACT THE FIFTH  SCENE an inn  Enter OLIVIA JARVIS  OLIVIA  WELL we have got safe to the inn however Now if the postchaise were ready  JARVIS  The horses are just finishing their oats and as they are not going to be married they chuse to take their own time  OLIVIA  You are for ever giving wrong motives to my impatience  JARVIS  Be as impatient as you will the horses must take their own time besides you don't consider we have got no answer from our fellowtraveller yet If we hear nothing from Mr Leontine we have only one way left us  OLIVIA  What way  JARVIS  The way home again  OLIVIA  Not so I have made a resolution to go and nothing shall induce me to break it  JARVIS  Ay resolutions are well kept when they jump with inclination However I'll go hasten things without And I'll call too at the bar to see if any thing should be left for us there Don't be in such a plaguy hurry madam and we shall go the faster I promise you    Exit  Jarvis  Enter LANDLADY  LANDLADY  What Solomon why don't you move Pipes and tobacco for the Lamb thereWill nobody answer To the Dolphin quick The Angel has been outrageous this half hour Did your ladyship call madam  OLIVIA  No madam  LANDLADY  I find as you're for Scotland madamBut that's no business of mine married or not married I ask  no questions To be sure we had a sweet little couple set off from this two days ago for the same place The gentleman for a taylor was to be sure as fine a spoken taylor as ever blew froth from a full pot And the young lady so bashful it was near half an hour before we could get her to finish a pint of rasberry between us  OLIVIA  But this gentleman and I are not going to be married I assure you  LANDLADY  May be not That's no business of mine for certain Scotch marriages seldom turn out There was of my own knowledge miss Macfag that married her father's footmanAlackaday she and her husband soon parted and now keep separate cellars in Hedgelane  OLIVIA  A very pretty picture of what lies before me    Aside  Enter LEONTINE  LEONTINE  My dear Olivia my anxiety till you were out of danger was too great to be resisted I could not help coming to see you set out tho' it exposes us to a discovery  OLIVIA  May every thing you do prove as fortunate Indeed Leontine we have been most cruelly disappointed Mr Honeywood's bill upon the city has it seems been protested and we have been utterly at a loss how to proceed  LEONTINE  How an offer of his own too Sure he could not mean to deceive us  OLIVIA  Depend upon his sincerity he only mistook the desire for the power of serving us But let us think no more of it I believe the postchaise is ready by this  LANDLADY  Not quite yet and begging your ladyship's pardon I don't think your ladyship quite ready for the postchaise The north road is a cold place madam I have a drop in the house of as pretty rasberry as ever was tipt over tongue Just a thimble full to keep the wind off your stomach To be sure the last couple we had here they said it was a perfect nosegay Ecod I sent them both away as good natur'dUp went the blinds round went the wheels and drive away postboy was the word  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  Well while my friend Honeywood is upon the post of danger at the bar it must be my business to have an eye about me here I think I know an incendiary's look for wherever the devil makes a purchase he never fails to set his mark Ha who have we here My son and daughter What can they be doing here  LANDLADY  I tell you madam it will do you good I think I know by this time what's good for the north road It's a raw night madamSir  LEONTINE  Not a drop more good madam I should now take it as a greater favour if you hasten the horses for I am afraid to be seen myself  LANDLADY  That shall be done Wha Solomon are you all dead there Wha Solomon I say    Exit bawling  OLIVIA  Well I dread lest an expedition begun in fear should end in repentanceEvery moment we stay increases our danger and adds to my apprehensions  LEONTINE  There's no danger trust me my dear there can be none if Honeywood has acted with honour and kept my father as he promised in employment till we are out of danger nothing can interrupt our journey  OLIVIA  I have no doubt of Mr Honeywood's sincerity and even his desires to serve us My fears are from your father's suspicions A mind so disposed to be alarmed without a cause will be but too ready when there's a reason  LEONTINE  Why let him when we are out of his power But believe me Olivia you have no great reason to dread his resentment His repining temper as it does no manner of injury to himself so will it never do harm to others He only frets to keep himself employed and scolds for his private amusement  OLIVIA  I don't know that but I'm sure on some occasions it makes him look most shockingly  CROAKER discovering himself  How does he look nowHow does he look now  OLIVIA  Ah  LEONTINE  Undone  CROAKER  How do I look now Sir I am your very humble servant Madam I am yours What you are  going off are you Then first if you please take a word or two from me with you before you go Tell me first where you are going and when you have told me that perhaps I shall know as little as I did before  LEONTINE  If that be so our answer might but increase your displeasure without adding to your information  CROAKER  I want no information from you puppy and you too good madam what answer have you got Eh    A cry without stop him    I think I heard a noise My friend Honeywood withouthas he seized the incendiary Ah no for now I hear no more on't  LEONTINE  Honeywood without Then sir it was Mr Honeywood that directed you hither  CROAKER  No sir it was Mr Honeywood conducted me hither  LEONTINE  Is it possible  CROAKER  Possible Why he's in the house now sir more anxious about me than my own son sir  LEONTINE  Then sir he's a villain  CROAKER  How sirrah a villain because he takes most care of your father I'll not bear it I tell you I'll not bear it Honeywood is a friend to the family and I'll have him treated as such  LEONTINE  I shall study to repay his friendship as it deserves  CROAKER  Ah rogue if you knew how earnestly he entered into my griefs and pointed out the means to detect them you would love him as I do    A cry without stop him    Fire and fury they have seized the incendiary they have the villain the incendiary in view Stop him stop an incendiary a murderer stop him    Exit  OLIVIA  Oh my terrors What can this new tumult mean  LEONTINE  Some new mark I suppose of Mr Honeywood's sincerity But we shall have satisfaction he shall give me instant satisfaction  OLIVIA  It must not be my Leontine if you value my esteem or my happiness Whatever be our fate let us not add guilt to our misfortunesConsider that our innocence will shortly be all we have left us You must forgive him  LEONTINE  Forgive him Has he not in every instance betrayed us Forced me to borrow money from him which appears a mere trick to delay us promised to keep my father engaged till we were out of danger and here brought him to the very scene of our escape  OLIVIA  Don't be precipitate We may yet be mistaken  Enter POSTBOY dragging in JARVIS HONEYWOOD entering soon after  POSTBOY  Ay master we have him fast enough Here is the incendiary dog I'm entitled to the reward I'll take  my oath I saw him ask for the money at the bar and then run for it  HONEYWOOD  Come bring him along Let us see him Let him learn to blush for his crimes    Discovering his mistake    Death what's here Jarvis Leontine Olivia What can all this mean  JARVIS  Why I'll tell you what it means that I was an old fool and that you are my masterthat's all  HONEYWOOD  Confusion  LEONTINE  Yes sir I find you have kept your word with me After such baseness I wonder how you can venture to see the man you have injured  HONEYWOOD  My dear Leontine by my life my honour  LEONTINE  Peace peace for shame and do not continue to aggravate baseness by hypocrisy I know you sir I know you  HONEYWOOD  Why won't you hear me By all that's just I knew not  LEONTINE  Hear you sir to what purpose I now see through all your low arts your ever complying with every opinion your never refusing any request your friendship as common as a prostitute's favours and as fallacious all these sir have long been contemptible to the world and are now perfectly so to me  HONEYWOOD  Ha contemptible to the world That reaches me    Aside  LEONTINE  All the seeming sincerity of your professions I now find were only allurements to betray and all your seeming regret for their consequences only calculated to cover the cowardice of your heart Draw villain  Enter CROAKER out of breath  CROAKER  Where is the villain Where is the incendiary    Seizing the postboy    Hold him fast the dog he has the gallows in his face Come you dog confess confess all and hang yourself  POSTBOY  Zounds master what do you throttle me for  CROAKER beating him  Dog do you resist do you resist  POSTBOY  Zounds master I'm not he there's the man that we thought was the rogue and turns out to be one of the company  CROAKER  How  HONEYWOOD  Mr Croaker we have all been under a strange mistake here I find there is nobody guilty it was all an error entirely an error of our own  CROAKER  And I say sir that you're in an error for there's guilt and double guilt a plot a damned jesuitical pestilential plot and I must have proof of it  HONEYWOOD  Do but hear me  CROAKER  What you intend to bring 'em off I suppose I'll hear nothing  HONEYWOOD  Madam you seem at least calm enough to hear reason  OLIVIA  Excuse me  HONEYWOOD  Good Jarvis let me then explain it to you  JARVIS  What signifies explanations when the thing is done  HONEYWOOD  Will nobody hear me Was there ever such a set so blinded by passion and prejudice    To the postboy    My good friend I believe you'll be surprised when I assure you  POSTBOY  Sure me nothingI'm sure of nothing but a good beating  CROAKER  Come then you madam if you ever hope for any favour or forgiveness tell me sincerely all you know of this affair  OLIVIA  Unhappily sir I'm but too much the cause of your suspicions you see before you sir one that with false pretences has stept into your family to betray it not your daughter  CROAKER  Not my daughter  OLIVIA  Not your daughterbut a mean deceiverwhosupport me I cannot  HONEYWOOD  Help she's going give her air  CROAKER  Ay ay take the young woman to the air I would not hurt a hair of her head whose ever daughter she may benot so bad as that neither    Exeunt all but  Croaker  CROAKER  Yes yes all's out I now see the whole affair my son is either married or going to be so to this lady whom he imposed upon me as his sister Ay certainly so and yet I don't find it afflicts me so much as one might think There's the advantage of fretting away our misfortunes beforehand we never feel them when they come  Enter MISS RICHLAND and SIR WILLIAM  SIR WILLIAM  But how do you know madam that my nephew intends setting off from this place  MISS RICHLAND  My maid assured me he was come to this inn and my own knowledge of his intending to leave the kingdom suggested the rest But what do I see my guardian here before us Who my dear sir could have have expected meeting you here to what accident do we owe this pleasure  CROAKER  To a fool I believe  MISS RICHLAND  But to what purpose did you come  CROAKER  To play the fool  MISS RICHLAND  But with whom  CROAKER  With greater fools than myself  MISS RICHLAND  Explain  CROAKER  Why Mr Honeywood brought me here to do nothing now I am here and my son is going to be married to I don't know who that is here so now you are as wise as I am  MISS RICHLAND  Married to whom sir  CROAKER  To Olivia my daughter as I took her to be but who the devil she is or whose daughter she is I know no more than the man in the moon  SIR WILLIAM  Then sir I can inform you and tho' a stranger yet you shall find me a friend to your family it will be enough at present to assure you that both in point of birth and fortune the young lady is at least your son's equal Being left by her father sir James Woodville  CROAKER  Sir James Woodville What of the west  SIR WILLIAM  Being left by him I say to the care of a mercenary wretch whose only aim was to secure her fortune to himself she was sent into France under pretence of education and there every art was tried to fix her for life in a convent contrary to her inclinations Of this I was informed upon my arrival at Paris and  as I had been once her father's friend I did all in my power to frustrate her guardian's base intentions I had even meditated to rescue her from his authority when your son stept in with more pleasing violence gave her liberty and you a daughter  CROAKER  But I intend to have a daughter of my own chusing sir A young lady sir whose fortune by my interest with those that have interest will be double what my son has a right to expect Do you know Mr Lofty sir  SIR WILLIAM  Yes sir and know that you are deceived in him But step this way and I'll convince you  Croaker  and  Sir William  seem to confer  Enter HONEYWOOD  HONEYWOOD  Obstinate man still to persist in his outrage Insulted by him despis'd by all I now begin to grow contemptible even to myself How have I sunk by too great an assiduity to please How have I overtax'd all my abilities lest the approbation of a single fool should escape me But all is now over I have survived my reputation my fortune my friendships and nothing remains henceforward for me but solitude and repentance  MISS RICHLAND  Is it true Mr Honeywood that you are setting off without taking leave of your friends The report is that you are quitting England Can it be  HONEYWOOD  Yes madam and tho' I am so unhappy as to have fallen under your displeasure yet thank Heaven I leave you to happiness to one who loves you and deserves your love to one who has power to procure you affluence and generosity to improve your enjoyment of it  MISS RICHLAND  And are you sure sir that the gentleman you mean is what you describe him  HONEYWOOD  I have the best assurances of it his serving me He does indeed deserve the highest happiness and that is in your power to confer As for me weak and wavering as I have been obliged by all and incapable of serving any what happiness can I find but in solitude What hope but in being forgotten  MISS RICHLAND  A thousand to live among friends that esteem you whose happiness it will be to be permitted to oblige you  HONEYWOOD  No madam my resolution is fix'd Inferiority among strangers is easy but among those that once were equals insupportable Nay to shew you how far my resolution can go I can now speak with calmness of my former follies my vanity my dissipation my weakness I will even confess that among the number of my other presumptions I had the insolence to think of loving you Yes madam while I was pleading the passion of another my heart was tortur'd with its own But it is over it was unworthy our friendship and let it be forgotten  MISS RICHLAND  You amaze me  HONEYWOOD  But you'll forgive it I know you will since the confession should not have come from me even now but to convince you of the sincerity of my intention ofnever mentioning it more    Going  MISS RICHLAND  Stay sir one momentHa he here  Enter LOFTY  LOFTY  Is the coast clear None but friends I have followed you here with a trifling piece of intelligence but it goes no farther things are not yet ripe for a discovery I have spirits working at a certain board your affair at the treasury will be done in less thana thousand years Mum  MISS RICHLAND  Sooner sir I should hope  LOFTY  Why yes I believe it may if it falls into proper hands that know where to push and where to parry that know how the land lieseh Honeywood  MISS RICHLAND  It is falien into yours  LOFTY  Well to keep you no longer in suspense your thing is done It is done I saythat's all I have just had assurances from lord Neverout that the claim has been examined and found admissible  Quictus  is the word madam  HONEYWOOD  But how his lordship has been at Newmarket these ten days  LOFTY  Indeed Then sir Gilbert Goose must have been most damnably mistaken I had it of him  MISS RICHLAND  He why sir Gilbert and his family have been in the country this month  LOFTY  This month It must certainly be soSir Gilbert's letter did come to me from Newmarket so that he must have met his lordship there and so it came about I have his letter about me I'll read it to you    Taking out a large bundle    That's from Paoli of Corsica that from the marquis of SquilachiHave you a mind to see a letter from count Poniatowski now king of PolandHonest Pon    Searching    O sir what are you here too I'll tell you what honest friend if you have not absolutely delivered my letter to sir William Honeywood you may return it The thing will do without him  SIR WILLIAM  Sir I have delivered it and must inform you it was received with the most mortifying contempt  CROAKER  Contempt Mr Lofty what can that mean  LOFTY  Let him go on let him go on I say You'll find it come to something presently  SIR WILLIAM  Yes sir I believe you'll be amazed if after waiting some time in the antichamber after being surveyed with insolent curiosity by the passing servants I was at last assured that sir William Honeywood knew no such person and I must certainly have been imposed upon  LOFTY  Good let me die very good Ha ha ha  CROAKER  Now for my life I can't find out half the goodness of it  LOFTY  You can't Ha ha  CROAKER  No for the soul of me I think it was as confounded a bad answer as ever was sent from one private gentleman to another  LOFTY  And so you can't find out the force of the message Why I was in the house at that very time Ha ha It was I that sent that very answer to my own letter Ha ha  CROAKER  Indeed How why  LOFTY  In one word things between sir William and me must be behind the curtain A party has many eyes He sides with lord Buzzard I side with sir Gilbert Goose So that unriddles the mystery  CROAKER  And so it does indeed and all my suspicions are over  LOFTY  Your suspicions What then you have been suspecting you have been suspecting have you Mr Croaker you and I were friends we are friends no longer Never talk to me It's over I say it's over  CROAKER  As I hope for your favour I did not mean to offend It escaped me Don't be discomposed  LOFTY  Zounds sir but I am discomposed and will be discomposed To be treated thus Who am I Was it for this I have been dreaded both by ins and outs Have I been libelled in the Gazetteer and praised in the St James's have I been chaired at Wildman's and a speaker at MerchantTaylor's Hall have I had my hand to addresses and my head in the printshops and talk to me of suspects  CROAKER  My dear sir be pacified What can you have but asking pardon  LOFTY  Sir I will not be pacifiedSuspects Who am I To be used thus Have I paid court to men in favour to serve my friends the lords of the treasury sir William Honeywood and the rest of the gang and talk to me of suspects Who am I I say who am I  SIR WILLIAM  Since sir you're so pressing for an answer I'll tell you who you are A gentleman as well acquainted with politics as with men in power as well acquainted with persons of fashion as with modesty with lords of the treasury as with truth and with all as you are with sir William Honeywood I am sir William Honeywood    Discovering his ensigns of the Bath  CROAKER  Sir William Honeywood  HONEYWOOD  Astonishment my uncle    Aside  LOFTY  So then my confounded genius has been all this time only leading me up to the garret in order to fling me out of the window  CROAKER  What Mr Importance and are these your works Suspect you You who have been dreaded by the ins and outs you who have had your hand to addresses and your head stuck up in printshops If you were served right you should have your head stuck up in the pillory  LOFTY  Ay stick it where you will for by the Lord it cuts but a very poor figure where it sticks at present  SIR WILLIAM  Well Mr Croaker I hope you now see how incapable this gentleman is of serving you and how little miss Richland has to expect from his influence  CROAKER  Ay sir too well I see it and I can't but say I have had some boding of it these ten days So I'm resolved since my son has placed his affections on a lady of moderate fortune to be satisfied with his choice and not run the hazard of another Mr Lofty in helping him to a better  SIR WILLIAM  I approve your resolution and here they come to receive a confirmation of your pardon and consent  Enter MRS CROAKER JARVIS LEONTINE and OLIVIA  MRS CROAKER  Where's my husband Come come lovey you must forgive them Jarvis here has been to tell me the whole affair and I say you must forgive them Our own was a stolen match you know my dear and we never had any reason to repent of it  CROAKER  I wish we could both say so However this gentleman sir William Honeywood has been beforehand with you in obtaining their pardon So if the two poor fools have a mind to marry I think we can tack them together without crossing the Tweed for it    Joining their hands  LEONTINE  How blest and unexpected What what can we say to such goodness But our future obedience shall be the best reply And as for this gentleman to whom we owe  SIR WILLIAM  Excuse me sir if I interrupt your thanks as I have here an interest that calls me    Turning to  Honeywood  Yes sir you are surprised to see me and I own that a desire of correcting your follies led me hither I saw with indignation the errors of a mind that only sought applause from others that easiness of disposition which though inclined to the right had not courage to condemn the wrong I saw with regret those splendid errors that still took name from some neighbouring duty Your charity that was but injustice your benevolence that was but weakness and your friendship but credulity I saw with regret great talents and extensive learning only employed to add sprightliness to error and encrease your perplexities I saw your mind with a thousand natural charms but the greatness of its beauty served only to heighten my pity for its prostitution  HONEYWOOD  Cease to upbraid me sir I have for some time but too strongly felt the justice of your reproaches But there is one way still left me Yes sir I have determined  this very hour to quit for ever a place where I have made myself the voluntary slave of all and to seek among strangers that fortitude which may give strength to the mind and marshal all its dissipated virtues Yet ere I depart permit me to solicit favour for this gentleman who notwithstanding what has happened has laid me under the most signal obligations Mr Lofty  LOFTY  Mr Honeywood I'm resolved upon a reformation as well as you I now begin to find that the man who first invented the art of speaking truth was a much cunninger fellow than I thought him And to prove that I design to speak truth for the future I must now assure you that you owe your late enlargement to another as upon my soul I had no hand in the matter So now if any of the company has a mind for preferment he may take my place I'm determined to resign    Exit  HONEYWOOD  How have I been deceived  SIR WILLIAM  No sir you have been obliged to a kinder fairer friend for that favour To miss Richland Would she complete our joy and make the man she has honoured by her friendship happy in her love I should then forget all and be as blest as the welfare of my dearest kinsman can make me  MISS RICHLAND  After what is past it would be but affectation to pretend to indifference Yes I will own an attachment which I find was more than friendship And if my intreaties cannot alter his resolution to quit the  country I will even try if my hand has not power to detain him    Giving her hand  HONEYWOOD  Heavens how can I have deserved all this How express my happiness my gratitude A moment like this overpays an age of apprehension  CROAKER  Well now I see content in every face but heaven send we be all better this day three months  SIR WILLIAM  Henceforth nephew learn to respect yourself He who seeks only for applause from without has all his happiness in another's keeping  HONEYWOOD  Yes sir I now too plainly perceive my errors My vanity in attempting to please all by fearing to offend any My meanness in approving folly lest fools should disapprove Henceforth therefore it shall be my study to reserve my pity for real distress my friendship for true merit and my love for her who first taught me what it is to be happy  EPILOGUE  The author in expectation of an Epilogue from a friend at Oxford deferred writing one himself till the very last hour What is here offered owes all its success to the graceful manner of the actress who spoke it  SPOKEN BY MRS BULKLEY  AS puffing quacks some caitiff wretch procure  To swear the pill or drop has wrought a cure  Thus on the stage our playwrights still depend  For Epilogues and Prologues on some friend  Who knows each art of coaxing up the town  And make full many a bitter pill go down  Conscious of this our bard has gone about  And teaz'd each rhyming friend to help him out  An Epilogue things can't go on without it  It cou'd not fail wou'd you but set about it  Young man cries one a bard laid up in clover  Alas young man my writing days are over  Let boys play tricks and kick the straw not I  Your brother doctor there perhaps may try  What I dear sir the doctor interposes  What plant my thistle sir among his roses  No no I've other contests to maintain  Tonight I head our troops at Warwicklane  Go ask your managerWho me Your pardon  Those things are not our fort at Coventgarden  Our author's friends thus plac'd at happy distance  Give him good words indeed but no assistance  As some unhappy wight at some new play  At the pit door stands elbowing away  While oft with many a smile and many a shrug  He eyes the centre where his friends sit snug  His simpering friends with pleasure in their eyes  Sinks as he sinks and as he rises rise  He nods they nod he cringes they grimace  But not a soul will budge to give him place  Since then unhelp'd our bard must now conform  To 'bide the pelting of this pittiless storm  Blame where you must be candid where you can  And be each critic the Goodnatur'd Man  SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER OR THE MISTAKES OF A NIGHT A COMEDY  AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN FIRST PRINTED IN MDCCLXXII  TO SAMUEL JOHNSON LLD  DEAR SIR  BY inscribing this slight performance to you I do not mean so much to compliment you as myself It may do me some honour to inform the public that I have lived many years in intimacy with you It may serve the interests of mankind also to inform them that the greatest wit may be found in a character without impairing the most unaffected piety  I have particularly reason to thank you for your partiality to this performance The undertaking a comedy not merely sentimental was very dangerous and Mr Colman who saw this piece in its various stages always thought it so However I ventured to trust it to the public and though it was necessarily delayed till late in the season I have every reason to be grateful I am  DEAR SIR  YOUR MOST SINCERE FRIEND AND ADMIRER OLIVER GOLDSMITH  PROLOGUE  BY DAVID GARRICK ESQ  Enter Mr WOODWARD dressed in black and holding a handkerchief to

SCENE a chamber in an oldfashioned house  Enter MRS HARDCASTLE and MR HARDCASTLE  MRS HARDCASTLE  I VOW Mr Hardcastle you're very particular Is there a creature in the whole country but ourselves that does not take a trip to town now and then to rub off the rust a little There's the two miss Hoggs and our neighbour Mrs Grigsby go to take a month's polishing every winter  HARDCASTLE  Ay and bring back vanity and affection to last them the whole year I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home In my time the follies of the town crept slowly among us but now they travel faster than a stagecoach Its fopperies come down not only as inside passengers but in the very basket  MRS HARDCASTLE  Ay your times were fine times indeed you have been telling us of them for many a long year Here we live in an old rumbling mansion that looks for all the world like an inn but that we never see company Our best visitors are old Mrs Oddfish the curate's wife and little Cripplegate the lame dancingmaster and all our entertainment your old stories of prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough I hate such oldfashioned trumpery  HARDCASTLE  And I love it I love every thing that's old old friends old times old manners old books old wine and I believe Dorothy    taking her hand    you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife  MRS HARDCASTLE  Lord Mr Hardcastle you're for ever at your Dorothy's and your old wife's You may be a Darby but I'll be no Joan I promise you I'm not so old as you'd make me by more than one good year Add twenty to twenty and make money of that  HARDCASTLE  Let me see twenty added to twenty makes just fifty and seven  MRS HARDCASTLE  It's false Mr Hardcastle I was but twenty when I was brought to bed of Tony that I had by Mr Lumpkin my first husband and he's not come to years of discretion yet  HARDCASTLE  Nor ever will I dare answer for him Ay you have taught him finely  MRS HARDCASTLE  No matter Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune My son is not to live by his learning I don't think a  boy wants much learning to spend fifteen hundred a year  HARDCASTLE  Learning quotha A mere composition of tricks and mischief  MRS HARDCASTLE  Humour my dear nothing but humour Come Mr Hardcastle you must allow the boy a little humour  HARDCASTLE  I'd sooner allow him an horsepond If burning the footmens shoes frighting the maids and worrying the kittens be humour he has it It was but yesterday he fastened my wig to the back of my chair and when I went to make a bow I popt my bald head in Mrs Frizzle's face  MRS HARDCASTLE  And am I to blame The poor boy was always too sickly to do any good A school would be his death When he comes to be a little stronger who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him  HARDCASTLE  Latin for him A cat and fiddle No no the alehouse and the stable are the only schools he'll ever go to  MRS HARDCASTLE  Well we must not snub the poor boy now for I believe we shan't have him long among us Any body that looks in his face may see he's consumptive  HARDCASTLE  Ay if growing too fat be one of the symptoms  MRS HARDCASTLE  He coughs sometimes  HARDCASTLE  Yes when his liquor goes the wrong way  MRS HARDCASTLE  I'm actually afraid of his lungs  HARDCASTLE  And truly so am I for he sometimes whoops like a speaking trumpet    Tony hallooing behind the scenes    O there he goesA very consumptive figure truly  Enter TONY crossing the stage  MRS HARDCASTLE  Tony where are you going my charmer Won't you give papa and I a little of your company lovee  TONY  I'm in hastle mother I cannot stay  MRS HARDCASTLE  You shan't venture out this raw evening my dear You look most shockingly  TONY  I can't stay I tell you The three pigeons expects me down every moment There's some fun going forward  HARDCASTLE  Ay the alehouse the old place I thought so  MRS HARDCASTLE  A low paltry set of fellows  TONY  Not so low neither There's Dick Muggins the exciseman Jack Slang the horse doctor little Aminadab that grinds the music box and Tom Twist that spins the pewter platter  MRS HARDCASTLE  Pray my dear disappoint them for one night at least  TONY  As for disappointing them I should not so much mind but I can't abide to disappoint myself  MRS HARDCASTLE    Detaining him    You shan't go  TONY  I will I tell you  MRS HARDCASTLE  I say you shan't  TONY  We'll see which is strongest you or I    Exit hawling her out  HARDCASTLE solus  Ay there goes a pair that only spoil each other But is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and discretion out of doors There's my pretty darling Kate the fashions of the times have almost infected her too By living a year or two in town she is as fond of gauze and French frippery as the best of them  Enter MISS HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Blessings on my pretty innocence drest out as usual my Kate Goodness what a quantity of superfluous silk has thou got about thee girl I could never teach the fools of this age that the indigent world could be cloathed out of the trimmings of the vain  MISS HARDCASTLE  You know our agreement sir You allow me the morning to receive and pay visits and to dress in my  own manner and in the evening I put on my housewife's dress to please you  HARDCASTLE  Well remember I insist on the terms of our agreement and by the bye I believe I shall have occasion to try your obedience this very evening  MISS HARDCASTLE  I protest sir I don't comprehend your meaning  HARDCASTLE  Then to be plain with you Kate I expect the young gentleman I have chosen to be your husband from town this very day I have his father's letter in which he informs me his son is set out and that he intends to follow himself shortly after  MISS HARDCASTLE  Indeed I wish I had known something of this before Bless me how shall I behave It's a thousand to one I shan't like him our meeting will be so formal and so like a thing of business that I shall find no room for friendship or esteem  HARDCASTLE  Depend upon it child I'll never controul your choice but Mr Marlow whom I have pitched upon is the son of my old friend sir Charles Marlow of whom you have heard me talk so often The young gentleman has been bred a scholar and is designed for an employment in the service of his country I am told he's a man of an excellent understanding  MISS HARDCASTLE  Is he  HARDCASTLE  Very generous  MISS HARDCASTLE  I believe I shall like him  HARDCASTLE  Young and brave  MISS HARDCASTLE  I'm sure I shall like him  HARDCASTLE  And very handsome  MISS HARDCASTLE  May dear papa say no more    kissing his hand    he's mine I'll have him  HARDCASTLE  And to crown all Kate he's one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world  MISS HARDCASTLE  Eh you have frozen me to death again That word reserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments A reserved lover it is said always makes a suspicious husband  HARDCASTLE  On the contrary modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues It was the very feature in his character that first struck me  MISS HARDCASTLE  He must have more striking features to catch me I promise you However if he be so young so handsome and so every thing as you mention I believe he'll do still I think I'll have him  HARDCASTLE  Ay Kate but there is still an obstacle It's more than an even wager he may not have you  MISS HARDCASTLE  My dear papa why will you mortify one soWell if he refuses instead of breaking my heart a  his indifference I'll only break my glass for its flattery Set my cap to some newer fashion and look out for some less difficult admirer  HARDCASTLE  Bravely resolved In the mean time I'll go prepare the servants for his reception as we seldom see company they want as much training as a company of recruits the first day's muster    Exit  MISS HARDCASTLE sola  Lud this news of papa's puts me all in a flutter Young handsome these he put last but I put them foremost Sensible goodnatured I like all that But then reserved and sheepish that's much against him Yet can't he be cured of his timidity by being taught to be proud of his wife Yes and can't IBut I vow I'm disposing of the husband before I have secured the lover  Enter MISS NEVILLE  MISS HARDCASTLE  I'm glad you're come Neville my dear Tell me Constance how do I look this evening Is there any thing whimsical about me Is it one of my well looking days child am I in face today  MISS NEVILLE  Perfectly my dear Yet now I look againbless mesure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold fishes Has your brother or the cat been meddling or has the last novel been too moving  MISS HARDCASTLE  No nothing of all this I have been threatenedI can scarce get it outI have been threatened with a lover  MISS NEVILLE  And his name  MISS HARDCASTLE  Is Marlow  MISS NEVILLE  Indeed  MISS HARDCASTLE  The son of sir Charles Marlow  MISS NEVILLE  As I live the most intimate friend of Mr Hastings my admirer They are never asunder I believe you must have seen him when we lived in town  MISS HARDCASTLE  Never  MISS NEVILLE  He's a very singular character I assure you Among women of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp you understand me  MISS HARDCASTLE  An odd character indeed I shall never be able to manage him What shall I do pshaw think no more of him but trust to occurrences for success But how goes on your own affair my dear has my mother been courting you for my brother Tony as usual  MISS NEVILLE  I have just come from one of our agreeable têteatêtes She has been saying a hundred tender things  and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection  MISS HARDCASTLE  And her partiality is such that she actually thinks him so A fortune like yours is no small temptation Besides as she has the sole management of it I'm not surprized to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family  MISS NEVILLE  A fortune like mine which chiefly consists in jewels is no such mighty temptation But at any rate if my dear Hastings be but constant I make no doubt to be too hard for her at last However I let her suppose that I am in love with her son and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another  MISS HARDCASTLE  My good brother holds out stoutly I could almost love him for hating you so  MISS NEVILLE  It is a goodnatured creature at bottom and I'm sure would wish to see me married to any body but himself But my aunt's bell rings for our afternoon's walk round the improvements Allons Courage is necessary as our affairs are critical  MISS HARDCASTLE  Would it were bed time and all were well    Exeunt  SCENE an alehouse room Several shabby fellows with punch and tobacco TONY at the head of the table a little higher than the rest a mallet in his hand  OMNES  Hurrea hurrea hurrea bravo  FIRST FELLOW  Now gentlemen silence for a song The 'squire is going to knock himself down for a song  OMNES  Ay a song a song  TONY  Then I'll sing you gentlemen a song I made upon this alehouse the three pigeons  SONG  Let schoolmasters puzzle their brain  With grammar

after his own father for that To be sure old 'squire Lumpkin was the finest gentleman  I ever set my eyes on For winding the streight horn or beating a thicket for a hare or a wench he never had his fellow It was a saying in the place that he kept the best horses dogs and girls in the whole county  TONY  Ecod and when I'm of age I'll be no bastard I promise you I have been thinking of Bett Bouncer and the miller's grey mare to begin with But come my boys drink about and be merry for you pay no reckoning Well Stingo what's the matter  Enter LANDLORD  LANDLORD  There be two gentlemen in a postchaise at the door They have lost their way upo' the forest and they are talking something about Mr Hardcastle  TONY  As sure as can be one of them must be the gentleman that's coming down to court my sister Do they seem to be Londoners  LANDLORD  I believe they may They look woundily like Frenchmen  TONY  Then desire them to step this way and I'll set them right in a twinkling    Exit landlord    Gentlemen as they mayn't be good enough company for you step down for a moment and I'll be with you in the squeezing of a lemon    Exeunt mob  TONY solus  Fatherinlaw has been calling me whelp and hound this half year Now if I pleased I could be  so revenged upon the old grumbletonian But then I'm afraidafraid of what I shall soon be worth fifteen hundred a year and let him frighten me out of that if he can  Enter LANDLORD conducting MARLOW and HASTINGS  MARLOW  What a tedious uncomfortable day have we had of it We were told it was but forty miles across the country and we have come above threescore  HASTINGS  And all Marlow from that unaccountable reserve of yours that would not let us inquire more frequently on the way  MARLOW  I own Hastings I am unwilling to lay myself under an obligation to every one I meet and often stand the chance of an unmannerly answer  HASTINGS  At present however we are not likely to receive any answer  TONY  No offence gentlemen But I'm told you have been inquiring for one Mr Hardcastle in those parts Do you know what part of the country you are in  HASTINGS  Not in the least sir but should thank you for information  TONY  Nor the way you came  HASTINGS  No sir but if you can inform us  TONY  Why gentlemen if you know neither the road you are going nor where you are nor the road you came the first thing I have to inform you is thatyou have lost your way  MARLOW  We wanted no ghost to tell us that  TONY  Pray gentlemen may I be so bold as to ask the place from whence you came  MARLOW  That's not necessary towards directing us where we are to go  TONY  No offence but question for question is all fair you know Pray gentlemen is not this same Hardcastle a crossgrain'd oldfashion'd whimsical fellow with an ugly face a daughter and a pretty son  HASTINGS  We have not seen the gentleman but he has the family you mention  TONY  The daughter a tall trapesing trolloping talkative maypolethe son a pretty wellbred agreeable youth that every body is fond of  MARLOW  Our information differs in this The daughter is said to be wellbred and beautiful the son an aukward booby reared up and spoiled at his mother's apronstring  TONY  HehehemThen gentlemen all I have to tell you is that you won't reach Mr Hardcastle's house this night I believe  HASTINGS  Unfortunate  TONY  It's a damn'd long dark boggy dirty dangerous way Stingo tell the gentlemen the way to Mr Hardcastle's    Winking upon the landlord    Mr Hardcastle's of Quagmire Marsh you understand me  LANDLORD  Master Hardcastle's Lockadaisy my masters you're come a deadly deal wrong When you came to the bottom of the hill you should have cross'd down Squashlane  MARLOW  Cross down Squashlane  LANDLORD  Then you were to keep straight forward 'till you came to four roads  MARLOW  Come to where four roads meet  TONY  Ay but you must be sure to take only one of them  MARLOW  O sir you're facetious  TONY  Then keeping to the right you are to go sideways till you come upon Crackskull common there you must look sharp for the track of the wheel and go forward 'till you come to farmer Murrain's barn Coming to the farmer's barn you are to turn to the right and then to the left and then to the right about again till you find out the old mill  MARLOW  Zounds man we could as soon find out the longitude  HASTINGS  What's to be done Marlow  MARLOW  This house promises but a poor reception though perhaps the landlord can accommodate us  LANDLORD  Alack master we have but one spare bed in the whole house  TONY  And to my knowledge that's taken up by three lodgers already    After a pause in which the rest seem disconcerted    I have hit it Don't you think Stingo our landlady could accommodate the gentlemen by the fireside withthree chairs and a bolster  HASTINGS  I hate sleeping by the fireside  MARLOW  And I detest your three chairs and a bolster  TONY  You do do youthen let me seewhatif you go on a mile further to the Buck's Head the old Buck's Head on the hill one of the best inns in the whole county  HASTINGS  O ho so we have escaped an adventure for this night however  LANDLORD    Apart to Tony    Sure you ben't sending them to your father's as an inn be you  TONY  Mum you fool you Let them find that out    To them    You have only to keep on straight forward till you come to a large old house by the road side You'll see a pair of large horns over the door That's  the sign Drive up the yard and call stoutly about you  HASTINGS  Sir we are obliged to you The servants can't miss the way  TONY  No no but I tell you though the landlord is rich and going to leave off business so he wants to be thought a gentleman saving your presence he he he He'll be for giving you his company and ecod if you mind him he'll persuade you that his mother was an alderman and his aunt a justice of peace  LANDLORD  A troublesome old blade to be sure but a keeps as good wines and beds as any in the whole country  MARLOW  Well if he supplies us with these we shall want no further connexion We are to turn to the right did you say  TONY  No no straight forward I'll just step myself and shew you a piece of the way    To the landlord    Mum  LANDLORD  Ah bless your heart for a sweet pleasantdamn'd mischievous son of a whore    Exeunt  ACT THE SECOND  SCENE an oldfashioned house  Enter HARDCASTLE followed by three or four aukward servants  HARDCASTLE  WELL I hope you're perfect in the table exercise I have been teaching you these three days You all know your posts and your places and can shew that you have been used to good company without ever stirring from home  OMNES  Ay ay  HARDCASTLE  When company comes you are not to pop out and stare and then run in again like frighted rabbits in a warren  OMNES  No no  HARDCASTLE  You Diggory whom I have taken from the barn are to make a shew at the sidetable and you Roger whom I have advanced from the plough are to place yourself behind my chair But you're not to stand so with your hands in your pocket Take your hands from your pockets Roger and from your head you blockhead you See how Diggory  carries his hands They're a little too stiff indeed but that's no great matter  DIGGORY  Ay mind how I hold them I learned to hold my hands this way when I was upon drill for the militia And so being upon drill  HARDCASTLE  You must not be so talkative Diggory You must be all attention to the guests You must hear us talk and not think of talking you must see us drink and not think of drinking you must see us eat and not think of eating  DIGGORY  By the laws your worship that's parfectly unpossible Whenever Diggory sees yeating going forward ecod he's always wishing for a mouthful himself  HARDCASTLE  Blockhead Is not a bellyfull in the kitchen as good as a bellyfull in the parlour Stay your stomach with that reflection  DIGGORY  Ecod I thank your worship I'll make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry  HARDCASTLE  Diggory you are too talkative Then if I happen to say a good thing or tell a good story at table you must not all burst out alaughing as if you made part of the company  DIGGORY  Then ecod your worship must not tell the story of ould grouse in the gun room I can't help laughing at thathe he hefor the soul of me We have laughed at that these twenty yearsha ha ha  HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha The story is a good one Well honest Diggory you may laugh at thatbut still remember to be attentive Suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine how will you behave A glass of wine sir if you please    To Diggory    Eh why don't you move  DIGGORY  Ecod your worship I never have courage till I see the eatables and drinkables brought upo' the table and then I'm as bauld as a lion  HARDCASTLE  What will nobody move  FIRST SERVANT  I'm not to leave this pleace  SECOND SERVANT  I'm sure it's no pleace of mine  THIRD SERVANT  Nor mine for sartain  DIGGORY  Wauns and I'm sure it canna be mine  HARDCASTLE  You numbskulls and so while like your betters you are quarrelling for places the guests must be starved O you dunces I find I must begin all over againBut don't I hear a coach drive into the yard To your posts you blockheads I'll go in the mean time and give my old friend's son a hearty reception at the gate    Exit  Hardcastle  DIGGORY  By the elevens my pleace is gone quite out of my head  ROGER  I know that my pleace is to be every where  FIRST SERVANT  Where the devil is mine  SECOND SERVANT  My pleace is to be no where at all and so ize go about my business    Exeunt servants running about as if frighted different ways  Enter SERVANT with candles shewing in MARLOW and HASTINGS  SERVANT  Welcome gentlemen very welcome This way  HASTINGS  After the disappointments of the day welcome once more Charles to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire Upon my word a very welllooking house antique but creditable  MARLOW  The usual fate of a large mansion Having first ruined the master by good housekeeping it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn  HASTINGS  As you say we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries I have often seen a good sideboard or a marble chimneypiece tho' not actually put in the bill enflame a reckoning confoundedly  MARLOW  Travellers George must pay in all places The only difference is that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries in bad inns you are fleeced and starved  HASTINGS  You have lived pretty much among them In truth I have been often surprised that you who have seen so much of the world with your natural  good sense and your many opportunities could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance  MARLOW  The Englishman's malady But tell me George where could I have learned that assurance you talk of My life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence I don't know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest womanexcept my motherBut among females of another class you know  HASTINGS  Ay among them you are impudent enough of all conscience  MARLOW  They are of  us  you know  HASTINGS  But in the company of women of reputation I never saw such an idiot such a trembler you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room  MARLOW  Why man that's because I do want to steal out of the room Faith I have often formed a resolution to break the ice and rattle away at any rate But I don't know how a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution An impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty but I'll be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence  HASTINGS  If you could but say half the fine things to them that I have heard you lavish upon the barmaid of an inn or even a college bedmaker  MARLOW  Why George I can't say fine things to them they freeze they petrify me They may talk of a comet or a burning mountain or some such bagatelle But to me a modest woman drest out in all her finery is the most tremendous object of the whole creation  HASTINGS  Ha ha ha At this rate man how can you ever expect to marry  MARLOW  Never unless as among kings and princes my bride were to be courted by proxy If indeed like an eastern bridegroom one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before it might be endured But to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship together with the episode of aunts grandmothers and cousins and at last to blurt out the broad staring question of Madam will you marry me No no that's a strain much above me I assure you  HASTINGS  I pity you But how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father  MARLOW  As I behave to all other ladies Bow very low Answer yes or no to all her demandsBut for the rest I don't think I shall venture to look in her face till I see my father's again  HASTINGS  I'm surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover  MARLOW  To be explicit my dear Hastings my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness not my own Miss Neville loves you the family don't know you as my friend you are sure of a reception and let honour do the rest  HASTINGS  My dear Marlow But I'll suppress the emotion Were I a wretch meanly seeking to carry off a fortune you should be the last man in the world I would apply to for assistance But miss Neville's person is all I ask and that is mine both from her deceased father's consent and her own inclination  MARLOW  Happy man You have talents and art to captivate any woman I'm doom'd to adore the sex and yet to converse with the only part of it I despise This stammer in my address and this aukward prepossessing visage of mine can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliner's 'prentice or one of the duchesses of Drurylane Pshaw this fellow here to interrupt us  Enter HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Gentlemen once more you are heartily welcome Which is Mr Marlow Sir you're heartily welcome It's not my way you see to receive my friends with my back to the fire I like to give them a hearty reception in the old style at my gate I like to see their horses and trunks taken care of  MARLOW aside  He has got our names from the servants already    To him    We approve your caution and hospitality sir    To Hastings    I have been thinking George of changing our travelling dresses in the morning I am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine  HARDCASTLE  I beg Mr Marlow you'll use no ceremony in this house  HASTINGS  I fancy George you're right the first blow is half the battle I intend opening the campaign with the white and gold  HARDCASTLE  Mr MarlowMr Hastingsgentlemenpray be under no constraint in this house This is Libertyhall gentlemen You may do just as you please here  MARLOW  Yet George if we open the campaign too fiercely at first we may want ammunition before it is over I think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat  HARDCASTLE  Your talking of a retreat Mr Marlow puts me in mind of the duke of Marlborough when we went to besiege Denain He first summoned the garrison  MARLOW  Don't you think the ventre dor waistcoat will do with the plain brown  HARDCASTLE  He first summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men  HASTINGS  I think not brown and yellow mix but very poorly  HARDCASTLE  I say gentlemen as I was telling you he summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men  MARLOW  The girls like finery  HARDCASTLE  Which might consist of about five thousand men well appointed with stores ammunition and other implements of war Now says the duke of Marlborough to George Brooks that stood next to himYou must have heard of George BrooksI'll pawn my dukedom says he but I take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood So  MARLOW  What my good friend if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour  HARDCASTLE  Punch sir    Aside    This is the most unaccountable kind of modesty I ever met with  MARLOW  Yes sir punch A glass of warm punch after our journey will be comfortable This is Libertyhall you know  HARDCASTLE  Here's cup sir  MARLOW    Aside    So this fellow in his Libertyhall will only let us have just what he pleases  HARDCASTLE    Taking the cup    I hope you'll find it to your mind I have prepared it with my own hands and I believe you'll own the ingredients are tolerable Will you be so good as to pledge me sir Here Mr Marlow here is to our better acquaintance    drinks    MARLOW    Aside    A very impudent fellow this but he's a character and I'll humour him a little Sir my service to you    drinks    HASTINGS    Aside    I see this fellow wants to give us his company and forgets that he's an innkeeper before he has learned to be a gentleman  MARLOW  From the excellence of your cup my old friend I suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country Warm work now and then at elections I suppose  HARDCASTLE  No sir I have long given that work over Since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other there is no business 'for us that sell ale'  HASTINGS  So then you have no turn for politics I find  HARDCASTLE  Not in the least There was a time indeed I fretted myself about the mistakes of government like other people but finding myself every day grow more angry and the government growing no better I left it to mend itself Since that I no more trouble my head about Heyder Ally or Ally Cawn than about Ally Croaker Sir my service to you  HASTINGS  So that with eating above stairs and drinking below with receiving your friends within and amusing them without you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it  HARDCASTLE  I do stir about a great deal that's certain Half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour  MARLOW    After drinking    And you have an argument in your cup old gentleman better than any in Westminsterhall  HARDCASTLE  Ay young gentleman that and a little philosophy  MARLOW    Aside    Well this is the first time I ever heard of an innkeeper's philosophy  HASTINGS  So then like an experienced general you attack them on every quarter If you find their reason manageable you attack it with your philosophy if you find they have no reason you attack them with this Here's your health my philosopher    drinks    HARDCASTLE  Good very good thank you ha ha Your generalship puts me in mind of prince Eugene when he fought the Turks at the battle of Belgrade You shall hear  MARLOW  Instead of the battle of Belgrade I believe it's almost time to talk about supper What has your philosophy got in the house for supper  HARDCASTLE  For supper sir    Aside    Was ever such a request to a man in his own house  MARLOW  Yes sir supper sir I begin to feel an appetite I shall make devilish work tonight in the larder I promise you  HARDCASTLE    Aside    Such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld    To him    Why really sir as for supper I can't well tell My Dorothy and the cookmaid settle these things between them I leave these kind of things entirely to them  MARLOW  You do do you  HARDCASTLE  Entirely Bythebye I believe they are in actual consultation upon what's for supper this moment in the kitchen  MARLOW  Then I beg they'll admit me as one of their privy council It's a way I have got When I travel I always chuse to regulate my own supper Let the cook be called No offence I hope sir  HARDCASTLE  O no sir none in the least yet I don't know how our Bridget the cookmaid is not very communicative upon these occasions Should we send for her she might scold us all out of the house  HASTINGS  Let's see your list of the larder then I ask it as a favour I always match my appetite to my bill of fare  MARLOW    To Hardcastle who looks at them with surprise    Sir he's very right and it's my way too  HARDCASTLE  Sir you have a right to command here Here Roger bring us the bill of fare for tonight's supper I believe it's drawn out Your manner Mr Hastings puts me in mind of my uncle colonel Wallop It was a saying of his that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it  HASTINGS    Aside    All upon the high ropes His uncle a colonel We shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of peace But let's hear the bill of fare  MARLOW    Perusing    What's here For the first course for the second course for the desert The devil sir do you think we have brought down the whole joiners company or the corporation of Bedford to eat up such a supper Two or three little things clean and comfortable will do  HASTINGS  But let's hear it  MARLOW    Reading    For the first course at the top a pig and pruin sauce  HASTINGS  Damn your pig I say  MARLOW  And damn your pruin sauce say I  HARDCASTLE  And yet gentlemen to men that are hungry pig with pruin sauce is very good eating  MARLOW  At the bottom a calve's tongue and brains  HASTINGS  Let your brains be knock'd out my good sir I don't like them  MARLOW  Or you may clap them on a plate by themselves I do  HARDCASTLE    Aside    Their impudence confounds me    To them    Gentlemen you are my guests make what alterations you please Is there any thing else you wish to retrench or alter gentlemen  MARLOW  Item A pork pie a boiled rabbit and sausages a florentine a shaking pudding and a dish of tifftafftaffety cream  HASTINGS  Confound your made dishes I shall be as much at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow dinner at the French ambassador's table I'm for plain eating  HARDCASTLE  I'm sorry gentlemen that I have nothing you like but if there be any thing you have a particular fancy to  MARLOW  Why really sir your bill of fare is so exquisite that any one part of it is full as good as another Send us what you please So much for supper And now to see that our beds are air'd and properly taken care of  HARDCASTLE  I entreat you'll leave all that to me You shall not stir a step  MARLOW  Leave that to you I protest sir you must excuse me I always look to these things myself  HARDCASTLE  I must insist sir you'll make yourself easy on that head  MARLOW  You see I'm resolved on it    Aside    A very troublesome fellow this as ever I met with  HARDCASTLE  Well sir I'm resolved at least to attend you    Aside    This may be modern modesty but I never saw any thing look so like oldfashioned impudence    Exeunt  Marlow  and  Hardcastle  HASTINGS solus  So I find this fellow's civilities begin to grow troublesome But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him Ha what do I see Miss Neville by all that's happy  Enter MISS NEVILLE  MISS NEVILLE  My dear Hastings To what unexpected good fortune to what accident am I to ascribe this happy meeting  HASTINGS  Rather let me ask the same question as I could never have hoped to meet my dearest Constance at an inn  MISS NEVILLE  An inn sure you mistake My aunt my guardian lives here What could induce you to think this house an inn  HASTINGS  My friend Mr Marlow with whom I came down and I have been sent here as to an inn I assure you A young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither  MISS NEVILLE  Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks of whom you have heard me talk so often ha ha ha  HASTINGS  He whom your aunt intends for you he of whom I have such just apprehensions  MISS NEVILLE  You have nothing to fear from him I assure you You'd adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me My aunt knows it too and has undertaken to court me for him and actually begins to think she has made a conquest  HASTINGS  Thou dear dissembler You must know my Constance I have just seized this happy opportunity of my friend's visit here to get admittance into the family The horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey but they'll soon be refreshed and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful Hastings we shall soon be landed in France where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected  MISS NEVILLE  I have often told you that though ready to obey you I yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance The greatest part of it was left me by my uncle the India director and chiefly consists in jewels I have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them I fancy I'm very near succeeding The instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours  HASTINGS  Perish the baubles Your person is all I desire In the mean time my friend Marlow must not be let into his mistake I know the strange reserve of his temper is such that if abruptly informed of it he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution  MISS NEVILLE  But how shall we keep him in the deception Miss Hardcastle is just returned from walking what if we still continue to deceive himThis this way    They confer  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  The assiduities of these good people teize me beyond bearing My host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone and so he claps not only himself but his oldfashioned wife on my back They talk of coming to sup with us too and then I suppose we are to run the gauntlet thro' all the rest of the familyWhat have we got here  HASTINGS  My dear Charles Let me congratulate youThe most fortunate accidentWho do you think is just alighted  MARLOW  Cannot guess  HASTINGS  Our mistresses boy miss Hardcastle and miss Neville Give me leave to introduce miss Constance Neville to your acquaintance Happening to dine in the neighbourhood they called on their return to take fresh horses here Miss Hardcastle has just stept into the next room and will be back in an instant Wasn't it lucky eh  MARLOW    Aside    I have been mortified enough of all conscience and here comes something to complete my embarrassment  HASTINGS  Well but wasn't it the most fortunate thing in the world  MARLOW  Oh yes Very fortunatea most joyful encounterBut our dresses George you know are in disorderWhat if we should postpone the happiness 'till tomorrowTomorrow at her own houseIt will be every bit as convenientand rather more respectfulTomorrow let it be    Offering to go  MISS NEVILLE  By no means sir Your ceremony will displease her The disorder of your dress will shew the ardour of your impatience Besides she knows you are in the house and will permit you to see her  MARLOW  O the devil how shall I support it hem hem Hastings you must not go You are to assist me you know I shall be confoundedly ridiculous Yet hang it I'll take courage Hem  HASTINGS  Pshaw man it's but the first plunge and all's over She's but a woman you know  MARLOW  And of all women she that I dread most to encounter  Enter MISS HARDCASTLE as returned from walking a bonnet c  HASTINGS introducing them  Miss Hardcastle Mr Marlow I'm proud of bringing two persons of such merit together that only want to know to esteem each other  MISS HARDCASTLE    Aside    Now for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face and quite in his own manner    After a pause in which he appears very uneasy and disconcerted    I'm glad of your safe arrival sirI'm told you had some accidents by the way  MARLOW  Only a few madam Yes we had some Yes madam a good many accidents but should be sorrymadamor rather glad of any accidentsthat are so agreeably concluded Hem  HASTINGS    To him    You never spoke better in your whole life Keep it up and I'll insure you the victory  MISS HARDCASTLE  I'm afraid you flatter sir You that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country  MARLOW    Gathering courage    I have lived indeed in the world madam but I have kept very little company I have been but an observer upon life madam while others were enjoying it  MISS NEVILLE  But that I am told is the way to enjoy it at last  HASTINGS    To him    Cicero never spoke better Once more and you are confirm'd in assurance for ever  MARLOW    To him    Hem Stand by me then and when I'm down throw in a word or two to set me up again  MISS HARDCASTLE  An observer like you upon life were I fear disagreeably employed since you must have had much more to censure than to approve  MARLOW  Pardon me madam I was always willing to be amused The folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness  HASTINGS    To him    Bravo bravo Never spoke so well in your whole life Well Miss Hardcastle I see that you and Mr Marlow are going to be very good company I believe our being here will but embarrass the interview  MARLOW  Not in the least Mr Hastings We like your company of all things    To him    Zounds George sure you won't go how can you leave us  HASTINGS  Our presence will but spoil conversation so we'll retire to the next room    To him    You don't consider man that we are to manage a little têteàtête of our own    Exeunt  MISS HARDCASTLE    After a pause    But you have not been wholly an observer I presume sir the ladies I should hope have employed some part of your addresses  MARLOW    Relapsing into timidity    Pardon me madam IIIas yet have studiedonlytodeserve them  MISS HARDCASTLE  And that some say is the very worst way to obtain them  MARLOW  Perhaps so madam But I love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sexBut I'm afraid I grow tiresome  MISS HARDCASTLE  Not at all sir there is nothing I like so much as grave conversation myself I could hear it for ever Indeed I have often been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those light airy pleasures where nothing reaches the heart  MARLOW  It'sa diseaseof the mind madam In the variety of tastes there must be some who wanting a relishforumaum  MISS HARDCASTLE  I understand you sir There must be some who wanting a relish for refined pleasures pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting  MARLOW  My meaning madam but infinitely better expressed And I can't help observinga  MISS HARDCASTLE    Aside    Who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon such occasions    To him    You were going to observe sir  MARLOW  I was observing madamI protest madam I forget what I was going to observe  MISS HARDCASTLE    Aside    I vow and so do I    To him    You were observing sir that in this age of hypocrisy something about hypocrisy sir  MARLOW  Yes madam In this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon strict inquiry do notaaa  MISS HARDCASTLE  I understand you perfectly sir  MARLOW    Aside    Egad and that's more than I do myself  MISS HARDCASTLE  You mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practise in private and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it  MARLOW  True madam those who have most virtue in their mouths have least of it in their bosoms But I'm sure I tire you madam  MISS HARDCASTLE  Not in the least sir there's something so agreeable and spirited in your manner such life and forcepray sir go on  MARLOW  Yes madam I was sayingthat there are some occasionswhen a total want of courage madam destroys all theand puts usupon aaa  MISS HARDCASTLE  I agree with you entirely a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance and betrays us when we most want to excel I beg you'll proceed  MARLOW  Yes madam Morally speaking madamBut I see miss Neville expecting us in the next room I would not intrude for the world  MISS HARDCASTLE  I protest sir I never was more agreeably entertained in all my life Pray go on  MARLOW  Yes madam I wasBut she beckons us to join her Madam shall I do myself the honour to attend you  MISS HARDCASTLE  Well then I'll follow  MARLOW    Aside    This pretty smooth dialogue has done for me    Exit  MISS HARDCASTLE sola  Ha ha ha Was there ever such a sober sentimental interview I'm certain he scarce look'd in  my face the whole time Yet the fellow but for his unaccountable bashfulness is pretty well too He has good sense but then so buried in his fears that it fatigues one more than ignorance If I could teach him a little confidence it would be doing somebody that I know of a piece of service But who is that somebodyThat faith is a question I can scarce answer    Exit  Enter TONY and MISS NEVILLE followed by MRS HARDCASTLE and HASTINGS  TONY  What do you follow me for cousin Con I wonder you're not ashamed to be so very engaging  MISS NEVILLE  I hope cousin one may speak to one's own relations and not be to blame  TONY  Ay but I know what sort of a relation you want to make me though but it won't do I tell you cousin Con it won't do so I beg you'll keep your distance I want no nearer relationship    She follows coquetting him to the back scene  MRS HARDCASTLE  Well I vow Mr Hastings you are very entertaining There's nothing in the world I love to talk of so much as London and the fashions though I was never there myself  HASTINGS  Never there You amaze me From your air and manner I concluded you had been bred all  your life either at Ranelagh St James's or Tower Wharf  MRS HARDCASTLE  O Sir you're only pleased to say so We country persons can have no manner at all I'm in love with the town and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics but who can have a manner that has never seen the Pantheon the Grotto Gardens the Borough and such places where the nobility chiefly resort All I can do is to enjoy London at secondhand I take care to know every têteàtête from the scandalous magazine and have all the fashions as they come out in a letter from the two miss Rickets of Crookedlane Pray how do you like this head Mr Hastings  HASTINGS  Extremely elegant and degagée upon my word madam Your friseur is a Frenchman I suppose  MRS HARDCASTLE  I protest I dressed it myself from a print in the ladies memorandumbook for the last year  HASTINGS  Indeed Such a head in a sidebox at the playhouse would draw as many gazers as my lady may'ress at a city ball  MRS HARDCASTLE  I vow since inoculation began there is no such thing to be seen as a plain woman so one must dress a little particular or one may escape in the crowd  HASTINGS  But that can never be your case madam in any dress    bowing    MRS HARDCASTLE  Yet what signifies my dressing when I have such a piece of antiquity by my side as Mr Hardcastle all I can say will never argue down a single button from his cloaths I have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig and where he was bald to plaister it over like my lord Pately with powder  HASTINGS  You are right madam for as among the ladies there are none ugly so among the men there are none old  MRS HARDCASTLE  But what do you think his answer was Why with his usual Gothic vivacity he said I only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tête for my own wearing  HASTINGS  Intolerable At your age you may wear what you please and it must become you  MRS HARDCASTLE  Pray Mr Hastings what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town  HASTINGS  Some time ago forty was all the mode but I'm told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter  MRS HARDCASTLE  Seriously Then I shall be too young for the fashion  HASTINGS  No lady begins now to put on jewels 'till she's past forty For instance miss there in a polite  circle would be considered as a child as a mere maker of samplers  MRS HARDCASTLE  And yet Mrs Niece thinks herself as much a woman and is as fond of jewels as the oldest of us all  HASTINGS  Your niece is she And that young gentleman a brother of yours I should presume  MRS HARDCASTLE  My son sir They are contracted to each other Observe their little sports They fall in and out ten times a day as if they were man and wife already    To them    Well Tony child what soft things are you saying to your cousin Constance this evening  TONY  I have been saying no soft things but that it's very hard to be followed about so Ecod I've not a place in the house now that's left to myself but the stable  MRS HARDCASTLE  Never mind him Con my dear He's in another story behind your back  MISS NEVILLE  There's something generous in my cousin's manner He falls out before faces to be forgiven in private  TONY  That's a damned confoundedcrack  MRS HARDCASTLE  Ah he's a sly one Don't you think they're like each other about the mouth Mr Hastings The  Blenkinsop mouth to a T They're of a size too Back to back my pretties that Mr Hastings may see you Come Tony  TONY  You had as good not make me I tell you    measuring  MISS NEVILLE  O lud he has almost cracked my head  MRS HARDCASTLE  O the monster For shame Tony You a man and behave so  TONY  If I'm a man let me have my fortin Ecod I'll not be made a fool of no longer  MRS HARDCASTLE  Is this ungrateful boy all that I'm to get for the pains I have taken in your education I that have rock'd you in your cradle and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon Did not I work that waistcoat to make you genteel Did not I prescribe for you every day and weep while the receipt was operating  TONY  Ecod you had reason to weep for you have been dosing me ever since I was born I have gone through every receipt in the complete huswife ten times over and you have thoughts of coursing me through Quincy next spring But ecod I tell you I'll not be made a fool of no longer  MRS HARDCASTLE  Wasn't it all for your good viper Wasn't it all for your good  TONY  I wish you'd let me and my good alone then Snubbing this way when I'm in spirits If I'm to have any good let it come of itself not to keep dinging it dinging it into one so  MRS HARDCASTLE  That's false I never see you when you're in spirits No Tony you then go to the alehouse or kennel I'm never to be delighted with your agreeable wild notes unfeeling monster  TONY  Ecod mamma your own notes are the wildest of the two  MRS HARDCASTLE  Was ever the like But I see he wants to break my heart I see he does  HASTINGS  Dear madam permit me to lecture the young gentleman a little I'm certain I can persuade him to his duty  MRS HARDCASTLE  Well I must retire Come Constance my love You see Mr Hastings the wretchedness of my situation was ever poor woman so plagued with a dear sweet pretty provoking undutiful boy    Exeunt  Mrs Hardcastle  and  Miss Neville  HASTINGS TONY  TONY singing  "There was a young man riding by and fain would have his will Rang do didlo dee"Don't mind her Let her cry It's the comfort of her heart I have  seen her and sister cry over a book for an hour together and they said they liked the book the better the more it made them cry  HASTINGS  Then you're no friend to the ladies I find my pretty young gentleman  TONY  That's as I find 'um  HASTINGS  Not to her of your mother's chusing I dare answer And yet she appears to me a pretty welltempered girl  TONY  That's because you don't know her as well as I Ecod I know every inch about her and there's not a more bitter cantanckerous toad in all christendom  HASTINGS    Aside    Pretty encouragement this for a lover  TONY  I have seen her since the height of that She has as many tricks as a hare in a thicket or a colt the first day's breaking  HASTINGS  To me she appears sensible and silent  TONY  Ay before company But when she's with her playmate she's as loud as a hog in a gate  HASTINGS  But there is a meek modesty about her that charms me  TONY  Yes but curb her never so little she kicks up and you're  lung in a ditch  HASTINGS  Well but you must allow her a little beautyYes you must allow her some beauty  TONY  Bandbox She's all a made up thing mun Ah could you but see Bet Bouncer of these parts you might then talk of beauty Ecod she has two eyes as black as sloes and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit cushion She'd make two of she  HASTINGS  Well what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands  TONY  Anon  HASTINGS  Would you thank him that would take miss Neville and leave you to happiness and your dear Betsy  TONY  Ay but where is there such a friend for who would take her  HASTINGS  I am he If you but assist me I'll engage to whip her off to France and you shall never hear more of her  TONY  Assist you Ecod I will to the last drop of my blood I'll clap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a twinkling and may be get you a part of her fortin beside in jewels that you little dream of  HASTINGS  My dear squire this looks like a lad of spirit  TONY  Come along then and you shall see more of my spirit before you have done with me    singing    We are the boys  That fears no noise  Where the thundering cannons roar    Exeunt  ACT THE THIRD  Enter HARDCASTLE solus  HARDCASTLE  WHAT could my old friend sir Charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town To me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue He has taken possession of the easy chair by the fire side already He took off his boots in the parlour and desired me to see them taken care of I'm desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughterShe will certainly be shocked at it  Enter MISS HARDCASTLE plainly dress'd  HARDCASTLE  Well my Kate I see you have changed your dress as I bid you and yet I believe there was no great occasion  MISS HARDCASTLE  I find such a pleasure sir in obeying your commands that I take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety  HARDCASTLE  And yet Kate I sometimes give you some cause particularly when I recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover today  MISS HARDCASTLE  You taught me to expect something extraordinary and I find the original exceeds the description  HARDCASTLE  I was never so surprised in my life He has quite confounded all my faculties  MISS HARDCASTLE  I never saw any thing like it and a man of the world too  HARDCASTLE  Ay he learned it all abroadwhat a fool was I to think a young man could learn modesty by travelling He might as soon learn wit at a masquerade  MISS HARDCASTLE  It seems all natural to him  HARDCASTLE  A good deal assisted by bad company and a French dancingmaster  MISS HARDCASTLE  Sure you mistake papa A French dancingmaster could never have taught him that timid lookthat aukward addressthat bashful manner  HARDCASTLE  Whose look whose manner child  MISS HARDCASTLE  Mr Marlow's his mauvaise honte his timidity struck me at the first sight  HARDCASTLE  Then your first sight deceived you for I think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses  MISS HARDCASTLE  Sure sir you rally I never saw any one so modest  HARDCASTLE  And can you be serious I never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since I was born Bully Dawson was but a fool to him  MISS HARDCASTLE  Surprising He met me with a respectful bow a stammering voice and a look fixed on the ground  HARDCASTLE  He met me with a loud voice a lordly air and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again  MISS HARDCASTLE  He treated me with diffidence and respect censured the manners of the age admired the prudence of girls that never laughed tired me with apologies for being tiresome then left the room with a bow and madam I would not for the world detain you  HARDCASTLE  He spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before Asked twenty questions and never waited for an answer Interrupted my best remarks with  some silly pun and when I was in my best story of the duke of Marlborough and prince Eugene he asked if I had not a good hand at making punch Yes Kate he asked your father if he was a maker of punch  MISS HARDCASTLE  One of us must certainly be mistaken  HARDCASTLE  If he be what he has shewn himself I'm determined he shall never have my consent  MISS HARDCASTLE  And if he be the sullen thing I take him he shall never have mine  HARDCASTLE  In one thing then we are agreedto reject him  MISS HARDCASTLE  Yes But upon conditions For if you should find him less impudent and I more presuming if you find him more respectful and I more importunateI don't knowthe fellow is well enough for a manCertainly we don't meet many such at a horse race in the country  HARDCASTLE  If we should find him soBut that's impossible The first appearance has done my business I'm seldom deceived in that  MISS HARDCASTLE  And yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance  HARDCASTLE  Ay when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her taste she then sets about guessing the rest of his  furniture With her a smooth face stands for good sense and a genteel figure for every virtue  MISS HARDCASTLE  I hope sir a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense won't end with a sneer at my understanding  HARDCASTLE  Pardon me Kate But if young Mr Brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions he may please us both perhaps  MISS HARDCASTLE  And as one of us must be mistaken what if we go to make further discoveries  HARDCASTLE  Agreed But depend on't I'm in the right  MISS HARDCASTLE  And depend on't I'm not much in the wrong    Exeunt  Enter TONY running in with a casket  TONY  Ecod I have got them Here they are My cousin Con's necklaces bobs and all My mother shan't cheat the poor souls out of their fortin neither O my genus is that you  Enter HASTINGS  HASTINGS  My dear friend how have you managed with your mother I hope you have amused her with pretending love for your cousin and that you are willing to be reconciled at last Our horses will be  refreshed in a short time and we shall soon be ready to set off  TONY  And here's something to bear your charges by the way    giving the casket    your sweetheart's jewels Keep them and hang those I say that would rob you of one of them  HASTINGS  But how have you procured them from your mother  TONY  Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no fibs I procured them by the rule of thumb If I had not a key to every drawer in mother's bureau how could I go to the alehouse so often as I do An honest man may rob himself of his own at any time  HASTINGS  Thousands do it every day But to be plain with you miss Neville is endeavouring to procure them from her aunt this very instant If she succeeds it will be the most delicate way at least of obtaining them  TONY  Well keep them till you know how it will be But I know how it will be well enough she'd as soon part with the only sound tooth in her head  HASTINGS  But I dread the effects of her resentment when she finds she has lost them  TONY  Never you mind her resentment leave me to manage that I don't value her resentment the bounce  of a cracker Zounds here they are Morrice Prance    Exit  Hastings  TONY MRS HARDCASTLE and MISS NEVILLE  MRS HARDCASTLE  Indeed Constance you amaze me Such a girl as you want jewels It will be time enough for jewels my dear twenty years hence when your beauty begins to want repairs  MISS NEVILLE  But what will repair beauty at forty will certainly improve it at twenty madam  MRS HARDCASTLE  Yours my dear can admit of none That natural blush is beyond a thousand ornaments Besides child jewels are quite out at present Don't you see half the ladies of our acquaintance my lady Killdaylight and Mrs Crump and the rest of them carry their jewels to town and bring nothing but paste and marcasites back  MISS NEVILLE  But who knows madam but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me  MRS HARDCASTLE  Consult your glass my dear and then see if with such a pair of eyes you want any better sparklers What do you think Tony my dear does your cousin Con want any jewels in your eyes to set off her beauty  TONY  That's as thereafter may be  MISS NEVILLE  My dear aunt if you knew how it would oblige me  MRS HARDCASTLE  A parcel of oldfashioned rose and tablecut things They would make you look like the court of king Solomon at a puppetshew Besides I believe I can't readily come at them They may be missing for aught I know to the contrary  TONY    Apart to Mrs Hardcastle    Then why don't you tell her so at once as she's so longing for them Tell her they're lost It's the only way to quiet her Say they're lost and call me to bear witness  MRS HARDCASTLE    Apart to Tony    You know my dear I'm only keeping them for you So if I say they're gone you'll bear me witness will you He he he  TONY  Never fear me Ecod I'll say I saw them taken out with my own eyes  MISS NEVILLE  I desire them but for a day madam Just to be permitted to shew them as relics and then they may be lock'd up again  MRS HARDCASTLE  To be plain with you my dear Constance if I could find them you should have them They're missing I assure you Lost for aught I know but we must have patience wherever they are  MISS NEVILLE  I'll not believe it this is but a shallow pretence to deny me I know they're too valuable to be so slightly kept and as you are to answer for the loss  MRS HARDCASTLE  Don't be alarm'd Constance If they be lost I must restore an equivalent But my son knows they are missing and not to be found  TONY  That I can bear witness to They are missing and not to be found I'll take my oath on't  MRS HARDCASTLE  You must learn resignation my dear for tho' we lose our fortune yet we should not lose our patience See me how calm I am  MISS NEVILLE  Ay people are generally calm at the misfortunes of others  MRS HARDCASTLE  Now I wonder a girl of your good sense should waste a thought upon such trumpery We shall soon find them and in the mean time you shall make use of my garnets till your jewels be found  MISS NEVILLE  I detest garnets  MRS HARDCASTLE  The most becoming things in the world to set off a clear complexion You have often seen how well they look upon me You shall have them    Exit  MISS NEVILLE  I dislike them of all things You shan't stirWas ever any thing so provoking to mislay my own jewels and force me to wear her trumpery  TONY  Dont be a fool If she gives you the garnets take what you can get The jewels are your own already I have stolen them out of her bureau and she does not know it Fly to your spark he'll tell you more of the matter Leave me to manage her  MISS NEVILLE  My dear cousin  TONY  Vanish She's here and has missed them already Zounds how she fidgets and spits about like a catharine wheel  Enter MRS HARDCASTLE  MRS HARDCASTLE  Confusion thieves robbers we are cheated plundered broke open undone  TONY  What's the matter what's the matter mamma I hope nothing has happened to any of the good family  MRS HARDCASTLE  We are  obbed My bureau has been broke open the jewels taken out and I'm undone  TONY  Oh is that all Ha ha ha By the laws I never saw it better acted in my life Ecod I thought you was ruin'd in earnest ha ha

HARDCASTLE  I tell you Tony by all that's precious the jewels are gone and I shall be ruin'd for ever  TONY  Sure I know they're gone and I am to say so  MRS HARDCASTLE  My dearest Tony but hear me They're gone I say  TONY  By the laws mamma you make me for to laugh ha ha I know who took them well enough ha ha ha  MRS HARDCASTLE  Was there ever such a blockhead that can't tell the difference between jest and earnest I tell you I'm not in jest booby  TONY  That's right that's right you must be in a bitter passion and then nobody will suspect either of us I'll bear witness that they are gone  MRS HARDCASTLE  Was there ever such a crossgrain'd brute that won't hear me Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool Was ever poor woman so beset with fools on one hand and thieves on the other  TONY  I can bear witness to that  MRS HARDCASTLE  Bear witness again you blockhead you and I'll turn you out of the room directly My poor niece  what will become of her Do you laugh you unfeeling brute as if you enjoyed my distress  TONY  I can bear witness to that  MRS HARDCASTLE  Do you insult me monster I'll teach you to vex your mother I will  TONY  I can bear witness to that    He runs off she follows him  Enter MISS HARDCASTLE and MAID  MISS HARDCASTLE  What an unaccountable creature is that brother of mine to send them to the house as an inn ha ha I don't wonder at his impudence  MAID  But what is more madam the young gentleman as you passed by in your present dress ask'd me if you were the barmaid He mistook you for the barmaid madam  MISS HARDCASTLE  Did he Then as live I'm resolved to keep up the delusion Tell me Pimple how do you like my present dress Don't you think I look something like Cherry in the Beaux Stratagem  MAID  It's the dress madam that every lady wears in the country but when she visits or receives company  MISS HARDCASTLE  And are you sure he does not remember my face or person  MAID  Certain of it  MISS HARDCASTLE  I vow I thought so for though we spoke for some time together yet his fears were such that he never once looked up during the interview Indeed if he had my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me  MAID  But what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake  MISS HARDCASTLE  In the first place I shall be seen and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market Then I shall perhaps make an acquaintance and that's no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex But my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giant's force before I offer to combat  MAID  But are you sure you can act your part and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that as he has already mistaken your person  MISS HARDCASTLE  Never fear me I think I have got the true barcantDid your honour callAttend the Lion therePipes and tobacco for the AngelThe Lamb has been outrageous this half hour  MAID  It will do madam But he's here    Exit  Maid  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  What a bawling in every part of the house I have scarce a moment's repose If I go to the best room there I find my host and his story If I fly to the gallery there we have my hostess with her curtesy down to the ground I have at last got a moment to myself and now for recollection    Walks and muses  MISS HARDCASTLE  Did you call sir Did your honour call  MARLOW    Musing    As for miss Hardcastle she's too grave and sentimental for me  MISS HARDCASTLE  Did your honour call    She still places herself before him he turning away  MARLOW  No child    musing    Besides from the glimpse I had of her I think she squints  MISS HARDCASTLE  I'm sure sir I heard the bell ring  MARLOW  No no    musing    I have pleased my father however by coming down and I'll tomorrow please myself by returning    Taking out his tablets and perusing  MISS HARDCASTLE  Perhaps the other gentleman called sir  MARLOW  I tell you no  MISS HARDCASTLE  I should be glad to know sir We have such a parcel of servants  MARLOW  No no I tell you    Looks full in her face    Yes child I think I did call I wantedI wantedI vow child you are

MISS HARDCASTLE  No sir we have been out of that these ten days  MARLOW  One may call in this house I find to very little purpose Suppose I should call for a taste just by way of trial of the nectar of your lips perhaps I might be disappointed in that too  MISS HARDCASTLE  Nectar nectar That's a liquor there's no call for in these parts French I suppose We keep no French wines here sir  MARLOW  Of true English growth I assure you  MISS HARDCASTLE  Then it's odd I should not know it We brew all sorts of wines in this house and I have lived here these eighteen years  MARLOW  Eighteen years Why one would think child you kept the bar before you were born How old are you  MISS HARDCASTLE  O sir I must not tell my age They say women and music should never be dated  MARLOW  To guess at this distance you can't be much above forty    approaching    Yet nearer I don't think so much    approaching    By coming close to some women they look younger still but when we come very close indeed    attempting to kiss her    MISS HARDCASTLE  I'ray sir keep your distance One would think you wanted to know one's age as they do horses by mark of mouth  MARLOW  I protest child you use me extremely ill If you keep me at this distance how is it possible you and I can be ever acquainted  MISS HARDCASTLE  And who wants to be acquainted with you I want no such acquaintance not I I'm sure you did not treat miss Hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner I'll warrant me before her you look'd dash'd and kept bowing to the ground and talk'd for all the world as if you was before a justice of peace  MARLOW    Aside    Egad She has hit it sure enough    To her    In awe of her child Ha ha ha A mere aukward squinting thing no no I find you don't know me I laugh'd and rallied her a little but I was unwilling to be too severe No I could not be too severe curse me  MISS HARDCASTLE  O then sir you are a favourite I find among the ladies  MARLOW  Yes my dear a great favourite And yet hang me I don't see what they find in me to follow At the ladies club in town I'm called their agreeable Rattle Rattle child is not my real name but one I'm known by My name is Solomons Mr

my dear There's Mrs Mantrap lady Betty Blackleg the countess of Sligo Mrs Langhorns old miss Biddy Buckskin and your humble servant keep up the spirit of the place  MISS HARDCASTLE  Then it's a very merry place I suppose  MARLOW  Yes as merry as cards supper wine and old women can make us  MISS HARDCASTLE  And their agreeable Rattle ha ha ha  MARLOW    Aside    Egad I don't quite like this chit She looks knowing methinks You laugh child  MISS HARDCASTLE  I can't but laugh to think what time they all have for minding their work or their family  MARLOW    Aside    All's well she don't laugh at me    To her    Do you ever work child  MISS HARDCASTLE  Ay sure There's not a screen or a quilt in the whole house but what can bear witness to that  MARLOW  Odso Then you must shew me your embroidery I embroider and draw patterns myself a little If you want a judge of your work you must apply to me    Seizing her hand  MISS HARDCASTLE  Ay but the colours don't look well by candlelight You shall see all in the morning    Struggling  MARLOW  And why not now my angel Such beauty fires beyond the power of resistancePshaw the father here My old luck I never nick'd seven that I did not throw ames ace three times following    Exit  Marlow  Enter HARDCASTLE who stands in surprise  HARDCASTLE  So madam So I find this is your modest lover This is your humble admirer that kept his eyes fixed on the ground and only ador'd at humble distance Kate Kate art thou not asham'd to deceive your father so  MISS HARDCASTLE  Never trust me dear papa but he's still the modest man I first took him for you'll be convinced of it as well as I  HARDCASTLE  By the hand of my body I believe his impudence is infectious Didn't I see him seize your hand Didn't I see him hawl you about like a milkmaid and now you talk of his respect and his modesty forsooth  MISS HARDCASTLE  But if I shortly convince you of his modesty that he has only the faults that will pass off with time and the virtues that will improve with age I hope you'll forgive him  HARDCASTLE  The girl would actually make one run mad I tell you I'll not be convinced I am convinced He has scarcely been three hours in the house and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives You may like his impudence and call it modesty But my soninlaw madam must have very different qualifications  MISS HARDCASTLE  Sir I ask but this night to convince you  HARDCASTLE  You shall not have half the time for I have thoughts of turning him out this very hour  MISS HARDCASTLE  Give me that hour then and I hope to satisfy you  HARDCASTLE  Well an hour let it be then But I'll have no trifling with your father All fair and open do you mind me  MISS HARDCASTLE  I hope sir you have ever found that I considered  your commands as my pride for your kindness is such that my duty as yet has been inclination  ACT THE FOURTH  Enter HASTINGS and MISS NEVILLE  HASTINGS  YOU surprise me Sir Charles Marlow expected here this night Where have you had your information  MISS NEVILLE  You may depend upon it I just saw his letter to Mr Hardcastle in which he tells him he intends setting out a few hours after his son  HASTINGS  Then my Constance all must be completed before he arrives He knows me and should he find me here would discover my name and perhaps my designs to the rest of the family  MISS NEVILLE  The jewels I hope are safe  HASTINGS  Yes yes I have sent them to Marlow who keeps the keys of our baggage In the mean time I'll go to prepare matters for our elopement I have had the Squire's promise of a sresh pair of horses and if I should not see him again will write him further directions    Exit  MISS NEVILLE  Well success attend you In the mean time I'll go amuse my aunt with the old pretence of a violent passion for my cousin    Exit  Enter MARLOW followed by a servant  MARLOW  I wonder what Hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a thing as a casket to keep for him when he knows the only place I have is the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor Have you deposited the casket with the landlady as I ordered you Have you put it into her own hands  SERVANT  Yes your honour  MARLOW  She said she'd keep it safe did she  SERVANT  Yes she said she'd keep it safe enough she ask'd me how I came by it and she said she had a great mind to make me give an account of myself    Exit  Servant  MARLOW  Ha ha ha They're safe however What an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst This little barmaid though runs in my head most strangely and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of the family She's mine she must be mine or I'm greatly mistaken  Enter HASTINGS  HASTINGS  Bless me I quite forgot to tell her that I intended to prepare at the bottom of the garden Marlow here and in spirits too  MARLOW  Give me joy George Crown me shadow me with laurels Well George after all we modest fellows don't want for success among the women  HASTINGS  Some women you mean But what success has your honour's modesty been crowned with now that it grows so insolent upon us  MARLOW  Didn't you see the tempting brisk lovely little thing that runs about the house with a bunch of keys to its girdle  HASTINGS  Well and what then  MARLOW  She's mine you rogue you Such fire such motion such eyes such lipsbut egad she would not let me kiss them though  HASTINGS  But are you so sure so very sure of her  MARLOW  Why man she talked of shewing me her work abovestairs and I am to improve the pattern  HASTINGS  But how can you Charles go about to rob a woman of her honour  MARLOW  Pshaw pshaw We all know the honour of the barmaid of an inn I don't intend to rob her take my word for it there's nothing in this house I snan't honestly pay for  HASTINGS  I believe the girl has virtue  MARLOW  And if she has I should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it  HASTINGS  You have taken care I hope of the casket I sent you to lock up It's in safety  MARLOW  Yes yes It's safe enough I have taken care of it But how could you think the seat of a postcoach at an inn door a place of safety Ah numbskull I have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourselfI have  HASTINGS  What  MARLOW  I have sent it to the landlady to keep for you  HASTINGS  To the landlady  MARLOW  The landlady  HASTINGS  You did  MARLOW  I did She's to be answerable for its forthcoming you know  HASTINGS  Yes she'll bring it forth with a witness  MARLOW  Wasn't I right I believe you'll allow that I acted prudently upon this occasion  HASTINGS    Aside    He must not see my uneasiness  MARLOW  You seem a little disconcerted though methinks Sure nothing has happened  HASTINGS  No nothing Never was in better spirits in all my life And so you left it with the landlady who no doubt very readily undertook the charge  MARLOW  Rather too readily For she not only kept the casket but thro' her great precaution was going to keep the messenger too Ha ha ha  HASTINGS  He he

HARDCASTLE  I believe you do from my soul sir But tho' I say nothing to your own conduct that of your servants is insufferable Their manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house I assure you  MARLOW  I protest my very good sir that's no fault of mine If they don't drink as they ought they are to blame I ordered them not to spare the cellar I did I assure you    To the side scene    Here let one of my servants come up    To him    My positive  directions were that as I did not drink myself they should make up for my desiciencies below  HARDCASTLE  Then they had your

sir and I desire that you and your drunken pack may leave my house directly  MARLOW  Leave your houseSure you jest my good friend What when I'm doing what I can to please you  HARDCASTLE  I tell you

and now that my passions are rouzed I say this house is mine sir this house is mine and I command you to leave it directly  MARLOW  Ha ha ha A puddle in a storm I shan't stir a step I assure you    In a serious tone    This your house fellow It's my house This is my house Mine while I chuse to stay What right have you to bid me leave this house sir I never met with such impudence curse me never in my whole life before  HARDCASTLE  Nor I confound me if ever I did To come to my house to call for what he likes to turn me out of my own chair to insult the family to order his servants to get drunk and then to tell me This house  is mine sir By all that's impudent it makes me laugh Ha ha ha Pray sir    bantering    as you take the house what think you of taking the rest of the furniture There's a pair of silver candlesticks and there's a firescreen and here's a pair of brazen nosed bellows perhaps you may take a fancy to them  MARLOW  Bring me your bill sir bring me your bill and let's make no more words about it  HARDCASTLE  There are a set of prints too What think you of the rake's progress for your own apartment  MARLOW  Bring me your bill I say and I'll leave you and your infernal house directly  HARDCASTLE  Then there's a mahogony table that you may see your own face in  MARLOW  My bill I say  HARDCASTLE  I had forgot the great chair for your own particular slumbers after a hearty meal  MARLOW  Zounds bring me my bill I say and let's hear no more on't  HARDCASTLE  Young man young man from your father's letter to me I was taught to expect a wellbred modest man as a visitor here but now I find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully but he will be down here presently and shall hear more of it    Exit  MARLOW  How's this Sure I have not mistaken the house Every thing looks like an inn The servants cry coming The attendance is aukward the barmaid too to attend us But she's here and will further inform me Whither so fast child A word with you  Enter MISS HARDCASTLE  MISS HARDCASTLE  Let it be short then I'm in a hurry    Aside    I believe he begins to find out his mistake but it's too soon quite to undeceive him  MARLOW  Pray child answer me one question What are you and what may your business in this house be  MISS HARDCASTLE  A relation of the family sir  MARLOW  What a poor relation  MISS HARDCASTLE  Yes sir A poor relation appointed to keep the keys and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them  MARLOW  That is you act as the barmaid of this inn  MISS HARDCASTLE  Inn O lawWhat brought that in your head One of the best families in the county keep an inn Ha ha ha old Mr Hardcastle's house an inn  MARLOW  Mr Hardcastle's house Is this house Mr Hardcastle's house child  MISS HARDCASTLE  Ay sure Whose else should it be  MARLOW  So then all's out and I have been damnably imposed on O confound my stupid head I shall be laugh'd at over the whole town I shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the printshops The Dullissimo Maccaroni To mistake this house of all others for an inn and my father's old friend for an innkeeper What a swaggering puppy must he take me for What a silly puppy do I find myself There again may I be hang'd my dear but I mistook you for the barmaid  MISS HARDCASTLE  Dear me dear me I'm sure there's nothing in my behaviour to put me upon a level with one of that stamp  MARLOW  Nothing my dear nothing But I was in for a list of blunders and could not help making you a subscriber My stupidity saw every thing the wrong way I mistook your assiduity for assurance and your simplicity for allurement But its overThis house I no more shew my face in  MISS HARDCASTLE  I hope sir I have done nothing to disoblige you I'm sure I should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite and said so many civil things to me I'm sure I should be sorry    pretending to cry    if he left the family upon my  account I'm sure I should be sorry people said any thing amiss since I have no fortune but my character  MARLOW    Aside    By heaven she weeps This is the first mark of tenderness I ever had from a modest woman and it touches me    To her    Excuse me my lovely girl you are the only part of the family I leave with reluctance But to be plain with you the difference of our birth fortune and education make an honourable connexion impossible and I can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honour of bringing ruin upon one whose only fault was being too lovely  MISS HARDCASTLE    Aside    Generous man I now begin to admire him    To him    But I'm sure my family is as good as miss Hardcastle's and though I'm poor that's no great misfortune to a contented mind and until this moment I never thought that it was bad to want fortune  MARLOW  And why now my pretty simplicity  MISS HARDCASTLE  Because it puts me at a distance from one that if I had a thousand pound I would give it all to  MARLOW    Aside    This simplicity bewitches me so that if I stay I'm undone I must make one bold effort and leave her    To her    Your partiality in my favour my dear touches me most sensibly and were I to live for myself alone I could easily six my choice But I owe too much to the opinion  of the world too much to the authority of a father so thatI can scarcely speak itit affects me Farewel    Exit  MISS HARDCASTLE  I never knew half his merit till now He shall not go if I have power or art to detain him I'll still preserve the character in which I stoop'd to conquer but will undeceive my papa who perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution    Exit  Enter TONY MISS NEVILLE  TONY  Ay you may steal for yourselves the next time I have done my duty She has got the jewels again that's a sure thing but she believes it was all a mistake of the servants  MISS NEVILLE  But my dear cousin sure you won't forsake us in this distress If she in the least suspects that I am going off I shall certainly be locked up or sent to my aunt Pedigree's which is ten times worse  TONY  To be sure aunts of all kinds are damn'd bad things But what can I do I have got you a pair of horses that will fly like Whistlejacket and I'm sure you can't say but I have courted you nicely before her face Here she comes we must court a bit or two more for fear she should suspect us    They retire and seem to fondle  Enter MRS HARDCASTLE  MRS HARDCASTLE  Well I was greatly fluttered to be sure But my son tells me it was all a mistake of the servants I shan't be easy however till they are fairly married and then let her keep her own fortune But what do I see fondling together as I'm alive I never saw Tony so sprightly before Ah have I caught you my pretty doves What billing exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs Ah  TONY  As for murmurs mother we grumble a little now and then to be sure But there's no love lost between us  MRS HARDCASTLE  A mere sprinkling Tony upon the flame only to make it burn brighter  MISS NEVILLE  Cousin Tony promises to give us more of his company at home Indeed he shan't leave us any more It won't leave us cousin Tony will it  TONY  O it's a pretty creature No I'd sooner leave my horse in a pound than leave you when you smile upon one so Your laugh makes you so becoming  MISS NEVILLE  Agreeable cousin Who can help admiring that natural humour that pleasant broad red thoughtless

smart answer just now to Mr Marlow We so laugh'dYou must know madamThis way a little for he must not hear us    They confer  TONY    Still gazing    A damn'd cramp piece of penmanship as ever I saw in my life I can read your print hand very well But here there are such handles and shanks and dashes that one can scarce tell the head from the tail "To Anthony Lumpkin esquire" It's very odd I can read the outside of my letters where my own name is well enough But when I come to open it it's allbuzz That's hard very hard for the inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence  MRS HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha Very well very well And so my son was too hard for the philosopher  MISS NEVILLE  Yes madam but you must hear the rest madam A little more this way or he may hear us You'll hear how he puzzled him again  MRS HARDCASTLE  He seems strangely puzzled now himself methinks  TONY    Still gazing    A damn'd up and down hand as if  was disguised in liquor    Reading    Dear sir  Ay that's that Then there's an M and a T and an S but whether the next be an izzard or an R confound me I cannot tell  MRS HARDCASTLE  What's that my dear Can I give you any assistance  MISS NEVILLE  Pray aunt let me read it No body reads a cramp hand better than I    twitching the letter from her    Do you know who it is from  TONY  Can't tell except from Dick Ginger the feeder  MISS NEVILLE  Ay

reads    Dear 'squire I'm now waiting for miss Neville with a postchaise and pair at the bottom of the garden but I find my horses yet unable to perform the journey I expect you'll assist us with a pair of fresh horses as you promised Dispatch is necessary as the hag ay the  hag your mother will otherwise suspect us Yours Hastings Grant me patience I shall run distracted My rage choaks me  MISS NEVILLE  I hope madam you'll suspend your resentment for a few moments and not impute to me any impertinence or sinister design that belongs to another  MRS HARDCASTLE    Curtesying very low    Fine spoken madam you are most miraculously polite and engaging and quite the very pink of curtesy and circumspection madam    Changing her tone    And you you great illfashioned oaf with scarce sense enough to keep your mouth shut Were you too join'd against me But I'll defeat all your plots in a moment As for you madam since you have got a pair of fresh horses ready it would be cruel to

your horse and guard us upon the way Here Thomas Roger Diggory I'll shew you that I wish you better than you do yourselves    Exit  MISS NEVILLE  So now I'm completely ruined  TONY  Ay that's a sure thing  MISS NEVILLE  What better could be expected from being connected with such a stupid fool and after all the nods and signs I made him  TONY  By the laws miss it was your own cleverness and not my stupidity that did your business You were so nice and so busy with your Shakebags and Goosegreens that I thought you could never be making believe  Enter HASTINGS  HASTINGS  So sir I find by my servant that you have shewn my letter and betray'd us Was this well done young gentleman  TONY  Here's another Ask miss there who betray'd you Ecod it was her doing not mine  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  So

And there sir is the gentleman to whom we all owe every obligation  MARLOW  What can I say to him a mere boy an idiot whose ignorance and age are a protection  HASTINGS  A poor contemptible booby that would but disgrace correction  MISS NEVILLE  Yet with cunning and malice enough to make himself merry with all our embarrassments  HASTINGS  An insensible cub  MARLOW  Replete with tricks and mischief

the care of another sir  MISS NEVILLE  Mr Hastings Mr Marlow Why will you increase my distress by this groundless dispute I implore I intreat you  Enter SERVANT  SERVANT  Your cloak madam My mistress is impatient  Exit  Servant  MISS NEVILLE  I come Pray be pacified If I leave you thus I shall die with apprehension  Enter SERVANT  SERVANT  Your fan muff and gloves madam The horses are waiting  MISS NEVILLE  O Mr Marlow if you knew what a scene of constraint and illnature lies before me I'm sure it would convert your resentment into pity  MARLOW  I'm so distracted with a variety of passions that I don't know what I do Forgive me madam  George forgive me You know my hasty temper and should not exasperate it  HASTINGS  The torture of my situation is my only excuse  MISS NEVILLE  Well my

happiness  MARLOW    To Tony    You see now young gentleman the effects of your folly What might be amusement to you is here disappointment and even distress  TONY    From a reverie    Ecod I have hit

all my hopes are over  SERVANT  Yes sir Old sir Charles is arrived He and the old gentleman of the house have been laughing at Mr Marlow's mistake this half hour They are coming this way  HASTINGS  Then I must not be seen So now to my fruitless appointment at the bottom of the garden This is about the time    Exit  Enter SIR CHARLES and HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha The peremptory tone in which he sent forth his sublime commands  SIR CHARLES  And the reserve with which I suppose he treated all your advances  HARDCASTLE  And yet he might have seen something in me above a common innkeeper too  SIR CHARLES  Yes Dick but he mistook you for an uncommon innkeeper ha ha ha  HARDCASTLE  Well I'm in too good spirits to think of any thing but joy Yes my dear friend this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary and tho' my daughter's fortune is but small  SIR CHARLES  Why Dick will you talk of fortune to me My son is possessed of more than a competence already and can want nothing but a good and virtuous girl to share his happiness and encrease it If they like each other as you say they do  HARDCASTLE  If man I tell you they do like each other My daughter as good as told me so  SIR CHARLES  But girls are apt to flatter themselves you know  HARDCASTLE  I saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself and here he comes to put you out of your ifs I warrant him  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  I come sir once more to ask pardon for my strange conduct I can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion  HARDCASTLE  Tut boy a trifle You take it too gravely An hour or two's laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again She'll never like you the worse for it  MARLOW  Sir I shall be always proud of her approbation  HARDCASTLE  Approbation is but a cold word Mr Marlow if I am not deceived you have something more than approbation thereabouts You take me  MARLOW  Really sir I have not that happiness  HARDCASTLE  Come boy I'm an old fellow and know what's what as well as you that are younger I know what has past between you but mum  MARLOW  Sure sir nothing has past between us but the most profound respect on my side and the most distant reserve on hers You don't think sir that my impudence has been past upon all the rest of the family  HARDCASTLE  Impudence No I don't say thatnot quite impudencethough girls like to be play'd with and  and rumpled a little too sometimes But she has told no tales I assure you  MARLOW  I never gave her the slightest cause  HARDCASTLE  Well well I like modesty in its place well enough But this is overacting young gentleman You may be open Your father and I will like you the better for it  MARLOW  May I die sir if I ever  HARDCASTLE  I tell you she don't dislike you and as I'm sure you like her  MARLOW  Dear sirI protest sir  HARDCASTLE  I see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as the parson can tie you  MARLOW  But hear me sir  HARDCASTLE  Your father approves the match I admire it every moment's delay will be doing mischief so  MARLOW  But why won't you hear me By all that's just and true I never gave miss Hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment or even the most distant hint to suspect me of affection We had but one interview and that was formal modest and uninteresting  HARDCASTLE    Aside    This fellow's formal modest impudence is beyond bearing  SIR CHARLES  And you never grasp'd her hand or made any protestations  MARLOW  As heaven is my witness I came down in obedience to your commands I saw the lady without emotion and parted without reluctance I hope you'll exact no further proofs of my duty nor prevent me from leaving a house in which I suffer so many mortifications    Exit  SIR CHARLES  I'm astonish'd at the air of sincerity with which he parted  HARDCASTLE  And I'm astonish'd at the deliberate intrepidity of his assurance  SIR CHARLES  I dare pledge my life and honour upon his truth  HARDCASTLE  Here comes my daughter and I would stake my happiness upon her veracity  Enter MISS HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Kate come hither child Answer us sincerely and without reserve has Mr Marlow made you any professions of love and affection  MISS HARDCASTLE  The question is very abrupt sir But since you require unreserved sincerity I think he has  HARDCASTLE    To sir Charles    You see  SIR CHARLES  And pray madam have you and my son had more than one interview  MISS HARDCASTLE  Yes sir several  HARDCASTLE    To sir Charles    You see  SIR CHARLES  But did he profess any attachment  MISS HARDCASTLE  A lasting one  SIR CHARLES  Did he talk of love  MISS HARDCASTLE  Much sir  SIR CHARLES  Amazing And all this formally  MISS HARDCASTLE  Formally  HARDCASTLE  Now my friend I hope you are satisfied  SIR CHARLES  And how did he behave madam  MISS HARDCASTLE  As most profest admirers do Said some civil things of my face talked much of his want of merit and the greatness of mine mentioned his heart gave a short tragedy speech and ended with pretended rapture  SIR CHARLES  Now I'm perfectly convinced indeed I know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive This forward canting ranting manner by no means describes him and I am confident he never sate for the picture  MISS HARDCASTLE  Then what sir if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity If you and my papa in about half an hour will place yourselves behind that screen you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person  SIR CHARLES  Agreed And if I find him what you describe all my happiness in him must have an end    Exit  MISS HARDCASTLE  And if you don't find him what I describeI fear my happiness must never have a beginning    Exeunt  SCENE changes to the back of the garden  Enter HASTINGS  HASTINGS  What an idiot am I to wait here for a fellow who probably takes a delight in mortifying me He never intended to be punctual and I'll wait no longer What do I see It is he and perhaps with news of my Constance  Enter TONY booted and spattered  HASTINGS  My honest 'squire I now find you a man of your word This looks like friendship  TONY  Ay I'm your friend and the best friend you have in the world if you knew but all This riding by night by the bye is cursedly tiresome It has shook me worse than the basket of a stagecoach  HASTINGS  But how Where did you leave your fellow travellers Are they in safety Are they housed  TONY  Five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no such bad driving The poor beasts have smoaked for it rabbet me but I'd rather ride forty miles after a fox than ten with such varment  HASTINGS  Well but where have you left the ladies I die with impatience  TONY  Left them Why where should I leave them but where I found them  HASTINGS  This is a riddle  TONY  Riddle me this then What's that goes round the house and round the house and never touches the house  HASTINGS  I'm still astray  TONY  Why that's it mon I have led them astray By jingo there's not a pond or slough within five miles of the place but they can tell the taste of  HASTINGS  Ha ha ha I understand you took them in a round while they supposed themselves going forward And so you have at last brought them home again  TONY  You shall hear I first took them down Featherbedlane where we stuck fast in the mud I then rattled them crack over the stones of Upanddown HillI then introduc'd them to the gibbet on Heavytree Heath and from that with a circumbendibus I fairly lodged them in the horsepond at the bottom of the garden  HASTINGS  But no accident I hope  TONY  No no Only mother is confoundedly frightened She thinks herself forty miles off She's sick of the journey and the cattle can scarce crawl So if your own horses be ready you may whip off with cousin and I'll be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow you  HASTINGS  My dear friend how can I be grateful  TONY  Ay now its dear friend noble 'squire Just now it was all idiot cub and run me through  the guts Damn your way of fighting I say After we take a knock in this part of the country we kiss and be friends But if you had run me through the guts then I should be dead and you might go kiss the hangman  HASTINGS  The rebuke is just But I must hasten to relieve miss Neville if you keep the old lady employed I promise to take care of the young one    Exit  Hastings  TONY  Never fear me Here she comes Vanish She's got from the pond and draggled up to the waist like a mermaid  Enter MRS HARDCASTLE  MRS HARDCASTLE  Oh Tony I'm killed Shook Battered to death I shall never survive it That last jolt that laid us against the quickset hedge has done my business  TONY  Alack mamma it was all your own fault You would be for running away by night without knowing one inch of the way  MRS HARDCASTLE  I wish we were at home again I never met so many accidents in so short a journey Drench'd in the mud overturn'd in a ditch stuck fast in a slough jolted to a jelly and at last to lose our way

There's morality however in his reply    Exit  Enter HASTINGS and MISS NEVILLE  HASTINGS  My dear Constance why will you deliberate thus If we delay a moment all is lost for ever Pluck up a little resolution and we shall soon be out of the reach of her malignity  MISS NEVILLE  I find it impossible My spirits are so sunk with the agitations I have suffered that I am unable to face any new danger Two or three years patience will at last crown us with happiness  HASTINGS  Such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy Let us fly my charmer Let us date our happiness from this very moment Perish fortune Love and content will encrease what we possess beyond a monarch's revenue Let me prevail  MISS NEVILLE  No Mr Hastings no Prudence once more comes to my relief and I will obey its dictates In the moment of passion fortune may be despised but it ever produces a lasting repentance I'm resolved to apply to Mr Hardcastle's compassion and justice for redress  HASTINGS  But tho' he had the will he has not the power to relieve you  MISS NEVILLE  But he has influence and upon that I am resolved to rely  HASTINGS  I have no hopes But since you persist I must reluctantly obey you    Exeunt  SCENE changes  Enter SIR CHARLES and MISS HARDCASTLE  SIR CHARLES  What a situation am I in If what you say appears I shall then find a guilty son If what he says be true I shall then lose one that of all others I most wish'd for a daughter  MISS HARDCASTLE  I am proud of your approbation and to shew I merit it if you place yourselves as I directed you shall hear his explicit declaration But he comes  SIR CHARLES  I'll to your father and keep him to the appointment    Exit sir Charles  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  Tho' prepar'd for setting out I come once more to take leave nor did I till this moment know the pain I feel in the separation  MISS HARDCASTLE    In her own natural manner    I believe these sufferings cannot be very great sir which you can so easily remove A day or two longer perhaps might  lessen your uneasiness by shewing the little value of what you now think proper to regret  MARLOW    Aside    This girl every moment improves upon me    To her    It must not be madam I have already trifled too long with my heart My very pride begins to submit to my passion The disparity of education and fortune the anger of a parent and the contempt of my equals begin to lose their weight and nothing can restore me to myself but this painful effort of resolution  MISS HARDCASTLE  Then go sir I'll urge nothing more to detain you Tho' my family be as good as hers you came down to visit and my education I hope not inferior what are these advantages without equal affluence I must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit I must have only the mockery of your addresses while all your serious aims are fix'd on fortune  Enter HARDCASTLE and SIR CHARLES from behind  SIR CHARLES  Here behind this screen  HARDCASTLE  Ay ay make no noise I'll engage my Kate covers him with confusion at last  MARLOW  By heavens madam fortune was ever my smallest consideration Your beauty at first caught my eye for who could see that without emotion  But every moment that I converse with you steals in some new grace heightens the picture and gives it stronger expression What at first seem'd rustic plainness now appears refin'd simplicity What seem'd forward assurance now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence and conscious virtue  SIR CHARLES  What can it mean He amazes me  HARDCASTLE  I told you how it would be Hush  MARLOW  I am now determined to stay madam and I have too good an opinion of my father's discernment when he sees you to doubt his approbation  MISS HARDCASTLE  No Mr Marlow I will not cannot detain you Do you think I could suffer a connexion in which there is the smallest room for repentance Do you think I would take the mean advantage of a transient passion to load you with confusion Do you think I could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours  MARLOW  By all that's good I can have no happiness but what's in your power to grant me Nor shall I ever feel repentance but in not having seen your merits before I will stay even contrary to your wishes and tho' you should persist to shun me I will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct  MISS HARDCASTLE  Sir I must entreat you'll desist As our acquaintance began so let it end in indifference I might have given an hour or two to levity but seriously Mr Marlow do you think I could ever submit to a connexion where I must appear mercenary and you imprudent Do you think I could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer  MARLOW    Kneeling    Does this look like security Does this look like confidence No madam every moment that shews me your merit only serves to encrease my diffidence and confusion Here let me continue  SIR CHARLES  I can hold it no longer Charles Charles how hast thou deceived me Is this your indifference your uninteresting conversation  HARDCASTLE  Your cold contempt your formal interview What have you to say now  MARLOW  That I'm all amazement What can it mean  HARDCASTLE  It means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure That you can address a lady in private and deny it in public that you have one story for us and another for my daughter  MARLOW  Daughterthis lady your daughter  HARDCASTLE  Yes sir my only daughter My Kate whose else should she be  MARLOW  Oh the devil  MISS HARDCASTLE  Yes sir that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for    curtesying    she that you addressed as the mild modest sentimental man of gravity and the bold forward agreeable Rattle of the ladies club ha ha ha  MARLOW  Zounds there's no bearing this it's worse than death  MISS HARDCASTLE  In which of your characters sir will you give us leave to address you As the faultering gentleman with looks on the ground that speaks just to be heard and hates hypocrisy or the loud confident creature that keeps it up with Mrs Mantrap and old miss Biddy Buckskin till three in the morning ha ha ha  MARLOW  O curse on my noisy head I never attempted to be impudent yet that I was not taken down I must be gone  HARDCASTLE  By the hand of my body but you shall not I see it was all a mistake and I am rejoiced to find it You shall not sir I tell you I know she'll forgive you Won't you forgive him Kate We'll all forgive you Take courage man    They retire she tormenting him to the back scene  Enter MRS HARDCASTLE TONY  MRS HARDCASTLE  So so they're gone off Let them go I care not  HARDCASTLE  Who gone  MRS HARDCASTLE  My dutiful niece and her gentleman Mr Hastings from town He who came down with our modest visitor here  SIR CHARLES  Who my honest George Hastings As worthy a fellow as lives and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice  HARDCASTLE  Then by the hand of my body I'm proud of the connexion  MRS HARDCASTLE  Well if he has taken away the lady he has not taken her fortune that remains in this family to console us for her loss  HARDCASTLE  Sure Dorothy you would not be so mercenary  MRS HARDCASTLE  Ay that's my affair not yours But you know if your son when of age refuses to marry his cousin her whole fortune is then at her own disposal  HARDCASTLE  Ay but he's not of age and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal  Enter HASTINGS and MISS NEVILLE  MRS HARDCASTLE    Aside    What returned so soon I begin not to like it  HASTINGS    To Hardcastle    For my late attempt to fly off with your niece let my present confusion be my punishment We are now come back to appeal from your justice to your humanity By her father's consent I first paid her my addresses and our passions were first founded in duty  MISS NEVILLE  Since his death I have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression In an hour of levity I was ready even to give up my fortune to secure my choice But I'm now recover'd from the delusion and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connexion  MRS HARDCASTLE  Pshaw pshaw this is all but the whining end of a modern novel  HARDCASTLE  Be it what it will I'm glad they're come back to reclaim their due Come hither Tony boy Do you refuse this lady's hand whom I now offer you  TONY  What signifies my refusing You know I can't refuse her till I'm of age father  HARDCASTLE  While I thought concealing your age boy was likely to conduce to your improvement I concurred with your mother's desire to keep it secret But since I find she turns it to a wrong use I must now declare you have been of age these three months  TONY  Of age Am I of age father  HARDCASTLE  Above three months  TONY  Then you'll see the first use I'll make of my liberty    taking miss Neville's hand    Witness all men by these presents that I Anthony Lumpkin esquire of BLANK place refuse you Constantia Neville spinster of no place at all for my true and lawful wife So Constance Neville may marry whom she pleases and Tony Lumpkin is his own man again  SIR CHARLES  O brave 'squire  HASTINGS  My worthy friend  MRS HARDCASTLE  My undutiful offspring  MARLOW  Joy my dear George I give you joy sincerely And could I prevail upon my little tyrant here to be less arbitrary I should be the happiest man alive if you would return me the favour  HASTINGS    To miss Hardcastle    Come madam you are now driven to the very last scene of all your contrivances  I know you like him I'm sure he loves you and you must and shall have him  HARDCASTLE    Joining their hunds    And I say so too And Mr Marlow if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter I don't believe you'll ever repent your bargain So now to supper Tomorrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us and the mistakes of the night shall be crowned with a merry morning so boy take her and as you have been mistaken in the mistress my wish is that you may never be mistaken in the wife  EPILOGUE  By DR GOLDSMITH  WELL having stoop'd to conquer with success  And gain'd a husband without aid from dress  Still as a barmaid I could wish it too  As I have conquer'd him to conquer you  And let me say for all your resolution  That pretty barmaids have done execution  Our life is all a play compos'd to please  "We have our exits and our entrances"  The first act shews the simple country maid  Harmless and young of ev'ry thing afraid  Blushes when hir'd and with unmeaning action  "I hopes as how to give you satisfaction"  Her second act displays a livelier scene  Th' unblushing barmaid of a country inn  Who whisks about the house at market caters  Talks loud coquets the guests and scolds the waiters  Next the scene shifts to town and there she soars  The chophouse toast of ogling connoisieurs  On 'squires and cits she there displays her arts  And on the gridiron broils her lover's hearts  And as she smiles her triumphs to compleat  Even common councilmen forget to eat  The fourth act shews her wedded to the 'squire  And madam now begins to hold it higher  Pretends to taste at Operas cries caro  And quits her Nancy Dawson for Che Faro  Doats upon dancing and in all her pride  Swims round the room the Heinel of Cheapside  Ogles and leers with artificial skill  Till having lost in age the power to kill  She sits all night at cards and ogles at spadille  Such thro' our lives the eventful history  The fifth and last act still remains for me  The barmaid now for your protection prays  Turns female Barrister and pleads for Bays  EPILOGUE  TO
