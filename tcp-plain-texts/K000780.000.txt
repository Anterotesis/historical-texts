 AN ELEGY WRITTEN ON Saint MARK'S Eve            Hom Iliad  LONDON Printed for M COOPER in PaternoterRow MDCCLIV  AN ELEGY WRITTEN ON Saint MARK'S Eve  FRAUGHT with malicious storm a louring cloud  Disrobes the firmament that glow'd with light  While from yon rainbeat porch the raven loud  Ushers with hideous shriek the startled night  The spider ticking from the fretted wall  And humming beetle sing their drowsy knell  The sightless batts a shrill assembly call  And dire events in dismal sounds foretell  To this lone waste this dark and dreary vale  Where mould'ring sleeps the onceinspired clay  If so I read aright the gossip tale  Each destin'd shade directs its gloomy way  How some the churlish and rough whirlwind ride  Mingling l've learnt amid the village throng  Others like sailing meteors nimbly glide  Or stalk slowpac'd the thickstrew'd tombs among  Each as her mind presents the varied shape  With greedy horror tells her heedful friend  She o'er the blue and glim'ring lamp agape  Feels every magic hair to start an end  Warn'd by that dying flame at length to part  Each trembling guest slips to her several bed  Whilst I fond swain bewail a slighted heart  And breathe my sorrows to the senseless dead  But thou that haunt'st the cloistercircled tower  Echo I ween dost hear my wailing moan  For sure as comes this sad and secret hour  Thy illtim'd sympathy returns each groan  Thou too pale cypress whose forewarning leaf  Strews the dull mansions of th' intombed dead  Say is it then in friendship to my grief  Thou point'st where soon shall rest this witless head  Yet for thou'rt wont my humble brow to crown  And eke my pipe thy wreathed bows sustain  If chance my fate should reach some shepherd clown  Tell for you know the story of my pain  Nor may thy bark its many a wound abide  The name which marreth us shall ruin thee  Nor shall the wise this simple talk deride  Can I find ought more stonydeaf than she  Tho' the proud trunk heaven's full despight doth brave  Nathless it yieldeth to the subtle wind  Tho' the rock frown the patient prostrate wave  By long assault doth sure admittance find  Yet she unmov'd my mournful sigh can hear  And sterner than the knotted oak remain  Yet she remorseless sees my falling tear  And less than lifeless flint regards my pain  But strait the sluggish hemlock springing round  Wafts to my slumb'ring sense the loaded gale  While night who now bad hush each ruder sound  Soft o'er my temples spreads her sable veil  The balmy influence of longlacked sleep  To sweet oblivion lulls my soothed breast  The winds that erst did lash that vexed deep  The storm of raging troubles sinks to rest  O Sleep how near to death art thou allied  O Death what art thou but a longer dream  Nor wot I of the ill that can betide  When thou so still and so serene dost seem  Strange sights oppress my fancy's wakeful eye  A gastly troop of meager ghosts appear  There one in pensive plight I do espy  To close with uncouth gait the creeping rear  Oh then thou spirit forlorn instruct me soon  Why shrinks my soul at thy partic'lar sight  Say why thou visit'st thus the paly moon  Doubling the native horrors of the night  Still in the most dejected front I see  Some struggling spark some faint upholding ray  Alas why comes not the same hope to thee  Thy mein is sadness and thy look dismay  At this he waves his head and strikes his breast  And thrice in piteous sort he doth assay  The eloquence of woe bespeaks the rest  And stops the fault'ring accent on its way  At length"I warn thee mark you cheerless train  "Know ere this eve returns to each is given  "Or to endure the fierce assault of pain  "Or freely tread the starpav'd courts of heaven  "See many a faded cheek and furrow'd brow  "That witness dire dismay and lost estate  "What soul so confident but fears to know  "That righteous sentence which must seal its fate  "The mimic tyrant whose contemptuous mind  "Ne'er smil'd in pity on the wretch beneath  "At the last hour in serious truth shall find  "No flattery in the chill embrace of death  "Awhile he stood in lawless pow'r unharm'd  "What pow'r shall screen him at that vengeful time  "When every eye shall wake each hand be arm'd  "To shame his folly and correct his crime  "What tho' the pageantry of labor'd woe  "Should bid the marble rise to solemn pride  "Such the false grandeur of its bootless shew  "It gilds the glittering slave it meant to hide  "The ruddy swain who leaves his quiet sleep  "Chiding with early song the ling'ring dawn  "Whose sober care directs the trooping sheep  "Or to the willowy brook or pastur'd lawn  "To whom as mindful of his lowly birth  "Nature an universal blank hath given  "Soon when he quits this dull unfriendly earth  "Shall rest approved by the voice of heaven  "For his poor steps would ne'er presume to tread  "Those muchworn paths where nobler feet had been  "Dar'd not to follow where they boldly led  "But left to greater souls the privilege to sin  "The charms of wit the joys of youth shall fade  "And beauty's early bloom shall wither'd be  "A killing blast shall strike th' unwary maid  "That heart will bleed tho' now it tortures thee  "The noise of sports the luxury of dress  "All giddy gay desires shall wear away  "Each splendid vanity forget to bless  "And she all wan with wasting grief decay  "For neither titled fame nor hoarded wealth  "Nor beauty's early bloom hath power to save  "Nor sober industry nor ruddy health  "Can hold one victim from th' untimely grave  "But idly sure the needful time we spend  "While as more weighty words I should impart  "O let thy reason's dearest thought attend  "And read th' awak'ning lesson to thine heart  "Far be thy custom'd place where yonder steep  "High overarch'd surveys the distant stream  "Think what a giddy height it is to leap  "Think and beware nor slight your warning dream  "To cleave the yielding unsubstantial air  "To light transfixt upon the pointed rock  "O thinkYet if thy steady sense can dare  "To meet with welcome hail this mortal shock  "Too soon thou wilt regret thine evil plight  "That spirit howe'er resolv'd must needs be griev'd  "When hell's dread regions open to the sight  "Regions which eye ne'er saw nor heart conceiv'd  "And well I ween the wretch whoe'er he be  "That swims that gulph shall never pass it more  "It is a merciless and thwarting sea  "That ne'er will waft him to the onceleft shore  "Then rue the hapless while thou foolish swain  "When thou wast trapped by those witching eyes  "It is the galled conscience gives the pain  "That fell insatiate worm that never dies  "To the gross mould from whence it did begin  "After short time the kindred clay returns  "While the more active light which shines within  "The unexhausted lamp for ever burns  "That quick'ning portion of the Spirit divine  "Shall surely last thro' endless time to come  "Nor seek her airy motions to confine  "Within the shallow limits of the tomb  "Perchance some fury like this scornful fair  "May haunt thy walks and every step attend  "Cloath'd in each frown the same she may appear  "Save this a mortal that a deathless fiend  "Yet worthless as I am I do not mean  "With curious and affrontive zeal to pry  "Where heaven hath drawn its curtain o'er the scene  "And shut the clouded prospect from mine eye  "This only and important truth I learn  "When the last trump shall wake the lazy dead  "No vain pretence no trifling fond concern  "Shall rouse the shrouded sinner from his bed  "Hence then and mingle in the mirthful train  "With them resume thy longneglected crook  "Awake to sprightly stop the pipe again  "Cheer thy sad heart and smooth thy loveworn look  "If so thine hallow'd soul thou e'er didst love  "As heaven in gentle mercy leans to thee  "If there be damn'd below or saints above  "If thou art mock'd of her or mourn'd of me  "If ought can move theefly the wily snare  "That may seduce thee to this fearful end"  When strait dissolving in the viewless air  "Awake" he cries "bestir thee and amend"  FINIS
