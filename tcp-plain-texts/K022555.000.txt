 New Hay at the Old Market AN OCCASIONAL DRAMA IN ONE ACT WRITTEN BY GEORGE COLMAN THE YOUNGER ON OPENING THE HayMarket Theatre On the th of  JUNE    LONDON PRINTED BY W WOODFALL FOR T CADELL AND W DAVIES STRAND PRICE ONE SHILLING  ADVERTISEMENT  IT may be necessary to inform the Reader who has not seen the following Sketch represented on the Stage that the character of  Apewell  is meant merely as a vehicle for Mr Caulfield's  Imitations  with which both the Mimick and the Author of the Piece are convinced the respectable persons imitated have too much good sense to be offended They are given as  Portraits  not as  Caricatures  and the Publick has pronounced them to be strong but unexaggerated likenesses of originals whom its discernment has long patronised and admired  Although the Author has been a litte free with his good friends the Winter Managers who are a little free with his Season he thinks it needless to offer any apology to them He is upon too good a footing with them to suppose that they expect it Friends and neighbours may joke with each other  Tap for tap and so part fair  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  FUSTIAN  Mr SUETT  DAGGERWOOD  Mr BANNISTER Jun  APEWELL  Mr

two gentlemen have left him at leisure  SERVANT  The moment Sir they make their Exit  Exit Servant  FUSTIAN  Make their Exit This fellow must have lived here some time by his language and I'll warrant him lies by rote like a Parrot  sits down and pulls out a manuscript  If I could but nail this Manager for a minute I'd read him such a Tragedy  DAGGERWOOD  dreaming  "Nay an thou'lt mouth I'll rant as well as thee"  FUSTIAN  Eh Damme he's talking in his sleep acting Hamlet before twelve tallow candles in the country  DAGGERWOOD  "To be or not to be"  FUSTIAN  Yeshe's at itLet me see  turning over the leaves of his Play  I think there's no doubt of its running  DAGGERWOOD  dreaming  "That is the question""Who would fardles bear"  FUSTIAN  Zouns There's no bearing youHis Grace's patronage will fill half the side Boxesand I'll warrant we'll stuff the criticks into the Pit  DAGGERWOOD  dreaming  "To groan and sweat"  "When he himself might his Quietus make"  FUSTIAN  Quietus I wish with all my heart I could make your's The Countess of Crambo insists on the best places for the first night of performance She'll sit in the Stage Box  DAGGERWOOD  still dreaming  "With a bare bodkin"  FUSTIAN  O the devil There's no enduring this Sir Sir  waking him  Do you intend to sleep any more  DAGGERWOOD  waking  Eh WhatWhen  "Methought I heard a voice cry sleep no more"  FUSTIAN  Faith Sir you heard something very like it and that voice was mine  DAGGERWOOD  Sir I'm your most respectful servant to command Sylvester Daggerwoodwhose benefit is fixed for the eleventh of June by particular desire of several persons of distinction You'd make an excellent Macbeth Sir  FUSTIAN  Sir  DAGGERWOOD  "Macbeth doth murder sleep the innocent sleep"  "Balm of hurt minds great nature's second course"  faith and very often the first course too when a dinner is unavoidably defer'd by your humble servant to command Sylvester Daggerwood  FUSTIAN  I am sorry Sir you should ever have occasion to postpone so pleasant a performance  DAGGERWOOD  Eating Sir is a most popular entertainment An entertainment for man and horse as I may say But I am apt to appear nice Sirand some how or other I never could manage to sit down to dinner in a bad Company  FUSTIAN  Has your company been bad then of late Sir  DAGGERWOOD  Damn'd bad indeed SirThe Dunstable Companywhere I have eight shillings a week four bits of candle one wife three shirts and nine children  FUSTIAN  A very numerous family  DAGGERWOOD  A crowded house to be sure Sir but not profitable Mrs Daggerwood a fine figure but unfortunately stutters so of no use in the theatrieal line Children too young to make a  debut  except  my eldest Master Apollo Daggerwood a youth of only eight years old who has twice made his appearance in Tom Thumb to an overflowing and brilliant barnhouse I meanwith unbounded and universal applause  FUSTIAN  Have you been long upon the Stage Mr Daggerwood  DAGGERWOOD  Fifteen years since I first smelt the lamp Sir My father was an eminent Buttonmaker at Birmingham and meant to marry me to Miss Molly Metre daughter to the rich Director of the Coalworks at Wolverhampton but I had a soul above buttons and abhorred the idea of a mercenary marriage I panted for a liberal profession so ran away from my father and engaged with a travelling company of Comedians In my travels I had soon the happiness of forming a romantick attachment with the present Mrs Daggerwood wife to Sylvester Daggerwood your humble servant to command whose benefit is fixed for the eleventh of June by the particular desire of several persons of distinction So you see Sir I have a taste  FUSTIAN  Have you Then sit down and I'll read you my Tragedy I am determined somebody shall hear it before I go out of the house  sits

Faith I should think soand to all appearance one of the Norwood party  DAGGERWOOD  Now Sir your title and then for the  Dram Pers  FUSTIAN  The title I think will strike The fashion of Plays you know now is to do away old prejudices and to rescue certain characters from the illiberal odium with which custom has mark'd them Thus we have a generous Israelite an amiable Cynick and so on Now Sir I call my play  The Humane Footpad  DAGGERWOOD  What  FUSTIAN  There's a title for you Isn't it happyeh How do you like my footpad  DAGGERWOOD  HumphWhy I think he'll strikebut then he ought to be properly executed  FUSTIAN  Oh Sir let me alone for that An exception to a general rule is now the grand secret for dramatick composition Mine is a freebooter of benevolence and plunders with sentiment  DAGGERWOOD  There may be something in that and for my part I was always with Shakespeare  "Who steals my purse steals trash"  I never had any weighty reasons yet for thinking otherwise Now Sir as we say please to "leave your damnable faces and begin"  FUSTIAN  My damnable faces  DAGGERWOOD  Come"we'll to't like french faulconers"  FUSTIAN  reading  Scene first a dark wood night

FUSTIAN  Don't interruptWhere was IOhbehind a cloud  DAGGERWOOD  "The cloud capt towers the gorgeous palaces"  FUSTIAN  Hey the devil what are you at  DAGGERWOOD  Beg pardon But that speech never comes into my head but it runs away with me Proceed  FUSTIAN  Enter  reading  DAGGERWOOD  "The solemn temples"  FUSTIAN  Nay then I've done  DAGGERWOOD  So have I I'm dumb  FUSTIAN  Enter Egbert musing  reading  DAGGERWOOD  O P  FUSTIAN  Pshaw what does that signify  DAGGERWOOD  Not much "The great Globe itself"  FUSTIAN  reading  Egbert musing Clouded in night I come  DAGGERWOOD  starting up  "The cloud capt towers the gorgeous palaces"  "The solemn temples" c c c  FUSTIAN  gets up  Damme he's mad A bedlamite raves like Lear and foams out a folio of Shakespeare withour drawing breath I'm almost afraid to stay in the room with him  Enter  SERVANT  Oh I'm glad you are come friend Now I shall be deliver'd Your master would be glad to see me I warrant  SERVANT  My Master is just gone out

Eveningand Mr Bannister Jun and Mr Suett are to meet him there on particular business  FUSTIAN  They are and what the devil friend have I to do with Mr Bannister Jun Damn Mr Bannister Jun  DAGGERWOOD  And damn Mr Suett what the devil have I to do with Mr Suett Now he has shirk'd us I'll lay an even bet he is gone to neither of 'em  FUSTIAN  Pretty treatment pretty treatment truly to be kept here half the morning kicking my heels in a Manager's antiroom shut up with a mad Dunstable actor  DAGGERWOOD  Mad Zounds Sir I'd have you to know that "when the wind's southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw"  FUSTIAN  Tell your master friend tell your master but no matterHe done catch me here again that's all Damme I'll go home turn my play into a pageant put a triumphal procession at the end on't and bring it out at one of the Winter Theatres  Exit  DAGGERWOOD  to the Servant  Young man you know me I shall come to the old arm chair again tomorrowbut must go  to Dunstable the day after for a week to finish my engagement Wish for an interviewinclination to tread the London boards and so on You remember my nameMr Sylvester Daggerwood whose benefit is fix'd for the eleventh of June by

old Drury Where's our little Manager  PROMPTER  Not come yet  BANNISTER  He must stir his stumps I can tell him that now he has set up for himself He gives a good round sum for the Property they tell me I hope he may be reimbursed  PROMPTER  There he trusts to the town  BANNISTER  He can't trust to any thing better The publick never fail to encourage Industry or to give  ample reward to those who embark with zeal in their service and rely with confidence on their liberality I shall be finely work'd for it though through the summer I take it Master Waldron  PROMPTER  Well then as you say the publick will encourage your industry  BANNISTER  Oh faith you need not tell me thatI trust I have always been found to work willinglyand at present I have a double motive to activity in serving the town and assisting an old friend who ventures largely for its amusement So here's defiance to heat and a fig for the Dogdays old Waldron  Enter  CALLBOY  CALLBOY  The Ladies and Gentlemen are all ready in the GreenRoom Sir  PROMPTER  Then we'll attend them Oh Bannister here's a song I am to give you It's intended for our opening  BANNISTER  Let me see it umwhy zouns there must be some mistake it seems meant for the winterfor it begins with an eulogy upon grand  spectacles  spacious buildings and large Theatres  PROMPTER  Well wellhum it over before we go into the GreenRoom  BANNISTER  Ehand here come some of our Chorus who may bear a burden  Enter Chorus  Here goes then  SONG  Since the preference we know  Is for pageantry and shew  'Twere a pity the publick to balk  And when people appear  Quite unable to hear  'Tis undoubtedly needless to talk  Let your Shakespeares and Jonsons go hang go hang  Let your Otways and Drydens go drown  Give us but Elephants and white Bulls enough  And we'll take in all the town  Brave boys  II  Or if tardily the sound  Travels all the house around  'Twixt the action and words there's a breach  And it seems as if Macbeth  Half a minute after death  On his back made his last dying speech  Let your Shakespeares c  III  When on matters of State  Stage Heroes debate  Intelligence so slowly is got  'Twere better they began  On the newinvented plan  And with Telegraphs transmitted you the plot  Let your Shakespeares c  IV  But our House here's so small  That there's no need to bawl  And the summer will rapidly pass  So we hope you'll think fit  To hear the Actors a bit  'Till the Elephants and Bulls come from grass  Then let Shakespeare and Jonson go hang go hang  Let your Otways and Drydens go drown  Give 'em but Elephants and white Bulls enough  And they'll take in all the town  Brave Boys  FINIS
