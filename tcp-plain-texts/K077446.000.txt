 CARACTACUS A Dramatic Poem  CARACTACUS A Dramatic Poem Written on the MODEL of The Ancient GREEK Tragedy  By the Author of ELFRIDA  Misimus lectas Druidum de gente Chorëas  LONDON Printed for J KNAPTON in LudgateStreet and R and J DODSLEY in PallMall MDCCLIX  TO The Rev  d  Mr HURD  ELEGY  FRIEND of my youth who when the willing Muse  Stream'd o'er my breast her warm poetic rays  Saw'st the fresh seeds their vital powers diffuse  And fed'st them with the fost'ring dew of praise  Whate'er the produce of th' unthrifty soil  The leaves the flowers the fruits to thee belong  The labourer earns the wages of his toil  Who form'd the Poet well may claim the song  Yes 'tis my pride to own that taught by thee  My conscious soul superior flights essay'd  Learnt from thy lore the Poet's dignity  And spurn'd the hirelings of the rhyming trade  Say scenes of Science say thou haunted stream  For oft my Museled steps did'st thou behold  How on thy banks I rifled every theme  That Fancy fabled in her age of gold  How oft I cry'd " O come thou tragic Queen  " March from thy Greece with firm majestic tread  " Such as when Athens saw thee fill her scene  " When Sophocles thy choral Graces led  " Saw thy proud pall it's purple length devolve  " Saw thee uplift the glitt'ring dagger high  " Ponder with fixed brow thy deep resolve  " Prepar'd to strike to triumph and to die  " Bring then to Britain's plain that choral throng  " Display thy buskin'd pomp thy golden lyre  " Give her historic forms the soul of song  " And mingle Attic art with Shakespear's fire"  " Ah what fond Boy dost thou presume to claim"  The Muse reply'd " Mistaken suppliant know  " To light in Shakespear's breast the dazzling flame  " Exhausted all Parnassus could bestow  " True Art remains and if from his bright page  " Thy mimic power one vivid beam can seize  " Proceed and in that best of tasks engage  " Which tends at once to profit and to please"  She spake and Harewood's Towers spontaneous rose  Soft virgin warblings eccho'd thro' the grove  And fair Elfrida pour'd forth all her woes  The hapless pattern of connubial Love  More awful scenes old Mona next display'd  Her caverns gloom'd her forests wav'd on high  While flam'd within their consecrated shade  The Genius stern of British liberty  And see my HURD to thee those scenes consign'd  O take and stamp them with thy honour'd name  Around the page be friendship's chaplet twin'd  And if they find the road to honest Fame  Perchance the candour of some nobler age  May praise the Bard who bad gay Folly bear  Nil equidem feci tu scis hoc ipse Theatris  Musa nec in plausus ambitiosa mea est  OVID Trist Lib V El vii  Her cheap applauses to the busy stage  And leave him pensive Virtue's silent tear  Chose too to consecrate his fav'rite strain  To Him who grac'd by ev'ry liberal art  That best might shine amid the learned train  Yet more excell'd in morals and in heart  Whose equal mind could see vain fortune shower  Her flimzy favours on the fawning crew  While in low Thurcaston's sequester'd bower  She fixt him distant from Promotion's view  Yet shelter'd there by calm Contentment's wing  Pleas'd he could smile and with sage HOOKER's eye  Part of a sentence in a letter of Hooker to Archbishop Whitgift See his Life in the Biographia Britannica  " See from his mother earth God's blessings spring  " And eat his bread in peace and privacy"  March  W MASON  Persons of the DRAMA  AULUS DIDIUS the Roman General  VELLINUS ELIDURUS Sons of Cartismandua  The dramatic part of the Chorus is supposed to be spoken by the chief Druid the lyrical part sung by the Bards  CHORUS of Druids and Bards  CARACTACUS  EVILINA Daughter to Caractacus  ARVIRAGUS Son to Caractacus  Scene MONA  CARACTACUS A Dramatic Poem  AULUS DIDIUS with Romans  THIS is the secret centre of the isle  Here Romans pause and let the eye of wonder  Gaze on the solemn scene behold yon oak  How stern he frowns and with his broad brown arms  Chills the pale plain beneath him mark yon altar  The dark stream brawling round it's rugged base  These cliffs these yawning caverns this wide circus  Skirted with unhewn stone they awe my soul  As if the very Genius of the place  Himself appear'd and with terrific tread  Stalk'd thro' his drear domain And yet my friends  If shapes like his be but the fancy's coinage  Surely there is a hidden power that reigns  'Mid the lone majesty of untam'd nature  Controuling sober reason tell me else  Why do these haunts of barb'rous superstition  O'ercome me thus I scorn them yet they awe me  Call forth the British Princes in this gloom  I mean to school them to our enterprize  Enter Vellinus and Elidurus  AULUS DIDIUS VELLINUS ELIDURUS  Ye pledges dear of Cartismandua's faith  Approach and to my uninstructed ear  Explain this scene of horror  ELIDURUS  Daring Roman  Thy footsteps press on consecrated ground  These mighty piles of magicplanted rock  Thus rang'd in mystic order mark the place  Where but at times of holiest festival  The Druid leads his train  AULUS DIDIUS  Where dwells the seer  VELLINUS  In yonder shaggy cave on which the moon  Now sheds a sidelong gleam His brotherhood  Possess the neighb'ring cliffs  AULUS DIDIUS  Yet up the hill  Mine eye descrys a distant range of caves  Delv'd in the ridges of the craggy steep  And this way still another  ELIDURUS  On the left  Refide the Sages skill'd in Nature's lore  The changeful universe it's numbers powers  Studious they measure save when meditation  Gives place to holy rites then in the grove  Each hath his rank and function Yonder grots  Are tenanted by Bards who nightly thence  Rob'd in their flowing vests of innocent white  Descend with harps that glitter to the moon  Hymning immortal strains The spirits of air  Of earth of water nay of heav'n itself  Do listen to their lay and oft 'tis said  In visible shapes dance they a magic round  To the high minstrelsy Now if thine eye  Be sated with the view haste to thy ships  And ply thine oars for if the Druids learn  This bold intrusion thou wilt find it hard  To foil their fury  AULUS DIDIUS  Prince I did not moor  My lightarm'd shallops on this dangerous strand  To sooth a fruitless curiosity  I come in quest of proud Caractacus  Who when our veterans put his troops to flight  Found refuge here  ELIDURUS  If here the Monarch rests  Presumptuous Chief thou might'st as well essay  To pluck him from yon stars Earth's ample range  Contains no surer refuge underneath  The soil we tread a hundred secret paths  Scoopt thro' the living rock in winding maze  Lead to as many caverns dark and deep  'Mid which the hoary sages act their rites  Mysterious rites of such strange potency  As done in open day would dim the sun  Tho' thron'd in noontide brightness In such dens  He may for life lie hid  AULUS DIDIUS  We know the task  Most difficult yet has thy royal mother  Furnish'd the means  ELIDURUS  My mother sayst thou Roman  AULUS DIDIUS  In proof of that firm faith she lends to Rome  She gave ye up her honour's hostages  ELIDURUS  She did and we submit  AULUS DIDIUS  To Rome we bear ye  From your dear country bear ye from your joys  Your loves your friendships all your souls hold precious  ELIDURUS  And dost thou taunt us Roman with our fate  AULUS DIDIUS  No Youth by heav'n I would avert that fate  Wish ye for liberty  VELLINUS ELIDURUS  More than for life  AULUS DIDIUS  And would do much to gain it  VELLINUS  Name the task  AULUS DIDIUS  The task is easy Haste ye to these Druids  Tell them ye come commission'd by your Queen  To seek the great Caractacus and call  His valour to her aid against the Legions  Which led by our Ostorius now assail  Her frontiers The late treaty she has seal'd  Is yet unknown and this her royal signet  Which more to mask our purpose was obtain'd  Shall be your pledge of faith The eager king  Will gladly take the charge and he consenting  What else remains but to the Meinaï's shore  Ye lead his credulous step there will we seize him  Bear him to Rome the substitute for you  And give you back to freedom  VELLINUS  If the Druids  AULUS DIDIUS  If they or he prevent this artifice  Then force must take it's way then flaming brands  And biting axes weilded by our soldiers  Must level these thick shades and so unlodge  The lurking savage  ELIDURUS  Gods shall Mona perish  AULUS DIDIUS  Princes her ev'ry trunk shall on the ground  Measure it's magnitude unless ere dawn  Ye lure this untam'd lion to our toils  Go then and prosper I shall to the ships  CARACTACUS  And there expect his coming Youths remember  He must to Rome to grace great Caesar's triumph  Caesar and Fate demand him at your hands  Exit Aulus Didius and Romans  ELIDURUS VELLINUS  And will heav'n suffer it Will the just gods  That tread yon spangled pavement o'er our heads  Look from their sky and yield them Will these Druids  Their sage vicegerents not call down the thunder  And will not instant it's hot bolts be darted  In such a righteous cause Yes good old king  Yes last of Britons thou art heav'ns own pledge  And shalt be such 'till death  VELLINUS  What means my brother  Dost thou refuse the charge  ELIDURUS  Dost thou accept it  VELLINUS  It gives us liberty  ELIDURUS  It makes us traytors  Gods would Vellinus do a deed of baseness  VELLINUS  Will Elidurus scorn the profer'd boon  Of freedom  ELIDURUS  Yes when such it's guilty price  Brother I spurn it  VELLINUS  Go then foolish boy  I'll do the deed myself  ELIDURUS  It shall not be  I will proclaim the fraud  VELLINUS  Wilt thou 'tis well  Hie to you cave call loudly on the Druid  And bid him drag to ignominious death  The partner of thy blood Yet hope not thou  To 'scape for thou didst join my impious steps  Therefore his wrath shall curse thee thou shalt live  Yet shalt thou live an interdicted wretch  All rights of nature cancell'd  ELIDURUS  O Vellinus  Rend not my soul by heav'n thou know'st I love thee  As fervently as brother e'er lov'd brother  And loving thee I thought I lov'd mine honour  Ah do not wake dear youth in this true breast  So fierce a conflict  VELLINUS  Honour's voice commands  Thou shouldst obey thy mother and thy queen  Honour and sage religion both conspire  To bid thee save these consecrated groves  From Roman devastation  ELIDURUS  Horrid thought  Hence let us haste ev'n to the furthest nook  Of this wide isle nor view the sacrilege  VELLINUS  No let us stay and by our prosperous art  Prevent the sacrilege Mark me my brother  More years and more experience have matur'd  My sober thought I will convince thy youth  That this our deed has ev'ry honest sanction  Cool reason may demand  ELIDURUS  To Rome with reason  Try if 'twill bring her deluging ambition  Into the level course of right and justice  Try if 'twill tame these insolent invaders  Who thus in savageness of conquest claim  Whom chance of war has spar'd Do this and prosper  But pray thee do not reason from my soul  It's inbred honesty that holy flame  How e'er eclips'd by Rome's black influence  In vulgar minds ought still to glow in ours  VELLINUS  Vain talker leave me  ELIDURUS  No I will not leave thee  I must not dare not in these perilous shades  Think if thy fraud should fail these holy men  How will their justice rend thy traitrous limbs  If thou succeed'st the fiercer pangs of conscience  How will they ever goad thy guilty soul  Mercy defend us see the awful Druids  Are issuing from their caves hear'st thou yon signal  Lo on the instant all the mountain whitens  With slowdescending Bards Retire retire  This is the hour of sacrifice to stay  Is death  VELLINUS  I'll wait the closing of their rites  In yonder vale do thou as likes thee best  Betray or aid me  ELIDURUS  To betray thee youth  That love forbids honour alas to aid thee  Exeunt  Enter CHORUS  SEMICHORUS  Sleep and Silence reign around  Not a nightbreeze wakes to blow  Circle sons this holy ground  Circle close in triple row  And if mask'd in vapors drear  Any earthborn Spirit dare  To hover round this sacred space  Haste with light spells the murky foe to chace  Lift your boughs of vervain blue  Dipt in cold September dew  And dash the moisture chaste and clear  O'er the ground and thro' the air  Now the place is purg'd and pure  Brethren say for this high hour  Are the milkwhite steers prepar'd  Whose necks the rude yoke never scar'd  To the furrow yet unbroke  For such must bleed beneath yon oak  SEMICHORUS  Druid these in order meet  Are all prepar'd  SEMICHORUS  But tell me yet  Cadwall did thy step profound  Dive into the cavern deep  Twice twelve fathom under ground  Where our sage forefathers sleep  Thence with reverence hast thou born  From the consecrated chest  The golden sickle scrip and vest  Whilom by old Belinus worn  SEMICHORUS  Druid these in order meet  Are all prepar'd  SEMICHORUS  But tell me yet  From the grot of charms and spells  Where our matron sister dwells  Brennus has thy holy hand  Safely brought the druid wand  And the potent adderstone  Gender'd 'fore th' autumnal moon  When in undulating twine  The foaming snakes prolific join  When they hiss and when they bear  Their wond'rous egg aloof in air  Thence before to earth it fall  The Druid in his hallow'd pall  Receives the prize  And instant flys  Follow'd by th' envenom'd brood  'Till he cross the crystal flood  SEMICHORUS  Druid these in order meet  Are all prepar'd  SEMICHORUS  Then all's compleat  And now let nine of the selected band  Whose greener years befit such station best  With wary circuit pace around the grove  And guard each inlet watchful lest the eye  Of busy curiosity profane  Pry on our rites which now must be as close  As done i'th' very central womb of earth  Occasion claims it for Caractacus  This night demands admission to our train  He once our king while ought his power avail'd  To save his country from the rod of tyrants  That duty past does wisely now retire  To end his days in secrecy and peace  Druid with Druids in this chief of groves  Ev'n in the heart of Mona See he comes  How awful is his port mark him my friends  He looks as doth the tower whose nodding walls  After the conflict of heav'n's angry bolts  Frown with a dignity unmark'd before  Ev'n in it's prime of strength Health to the king  CARACTACUS EVILINA CHORUS  This holy place methinks doth this night wear  More than it's wonted gloom Druid these groves  Have caught the dismal colouring of my soul  Changing their dark dun garbs to very sable  In pity to their guest Hail hallow'd oaks  Hail British born who last of British race  Hold your primaeval rights by nature's charter  Not at the nod of Caesar Happy foresters  Ye wave your bold heads 'mid the liberal air  Nor ask for priviledge a praetor's edict  Ye with your tough and intertwisted roots  Grasp the firm rocks ye sprung from and erect  In knotty hardihood still proudly spread  Your leafy banners 'gainst the tyrannous north  Who Roman like assails you Tell me Druid  Is it not better to be such as these  Than be the thing I am  CHORUS  To be the thing  Eternal wisdom wills is ever best  CARACTACUS  But I am lost to that predestin'd use  Eternal wisdom will'd and fitly therefore  May wish a change of being I was born  A king and Heav'n who bade these warrior oaks  Lift their green shields against the fiery sun  To fence their subject plain did mean that I  Should with as firm an arm protect my people  Against the pestilent glare of Rome's ambition  I fail'd and how I fail'd thou know'st too well  So does the babbling world and therefore Druid  I would be any thing save what I am  CHORUS  See to thy wish the holy rites prepar'd  Which if heav'n frown not consecrate thee Druid  See to the altar's base the victims led  From whose freegushing blood ourself shall read  Its high behests which if assenting found  These hands around thy chosen limbs shall wrap  The vest of sanctity while at the act  Yon whiterob'd bards sweeping their solemn harps  Shall lift their choral warblings to the skies  And call the gods to witness Meanwhile Prince  Bethink thee well if ought on this vain earth  Still holds too firm an union with thy soul  Estranging it from peace  CARACTACUS  I had a queen  Bear with my weakness Druid this tough breast  Must heave a sigh for she is unreveng'd  And can I taste true peace she unreveng'd  So chaste so lov'd a queen ah Evilina  Hang not thus weeping on the feeble arm  That cou'd not save thy mother  EVILINA  To hang thus  Softens the pang of grief and the sweet thought  That a fond father still supports his child  Sheds on my pensive mind such soothing balm  As doth the blessing of these pious seers  When most they wish our welfare Would to heav'n  A daughter's presence could as much avail  To ease her father's woes as his doth mine  CARACTACUS  Ever most gentle come unto my bosom  Dear pattern of the precious prize I lost  Lost so inglorious lost my friends these eyes  Did see her torn from my defenceless camp  Whilst I hemm'd round by squadrons could not save her  My boy still nearer to the darling pledge  Beheld her shrieking in the ruffian's arm  Beheld and fled  EVILINA  Ah Sir forbear to wound  My brother's fame he fled but to recall  His scatter'd forces to pursue and save her  CARACTACUS  Daughter he fled Now by yon gracious moon  That rising saw the deed and instant hid  Her blushing face in twilight's dusky veil  The flight was parricide  EVILINA  Indeed indeed  I know him valiant and not doubt he fell  'Mid slaughter'd thousands of the haughty foe  Victim to filial love Arviragus  Thou hadst no sister near the bloody field  Whose sorrowing search led by yon orb of night  Might find thy body wash with tears thy wounds  And wipe them with her hair  CHORUS  Peace virgin peace  Nor thou sad prince reply whate'er he is  Be he a captive fugitive or corse  He is what heav'n ordain'd these holy groves  Permit no exclamation 'gainst heav'n's will  To violate their echoes Patience here  Her meek hands folded on her modest breast  In mute submission lifts th' adoring eye  Ev'n to the storm that wrecks her  EVILINA  Holy Druid  If ought my erring tongue has said pollutes  This sacred place I from my soul abjure it  And will these lips bar with eternal silence  Rather than speak a word or act a deed  Unmeet for thy sage daughters blessing first  This hallow'd hour that takes me from the world  And joins me to their sober sisterhood  CHORUS  'Tis wisely said See prince this prudent maid  Now while the ruddy flame of sparkling youth  Glows on her beauteous cheek can quit the world  Without a sigh whilst thou  CARACTACUS  Would save my queen  From a base ravisher would wish to plunge  This falchion in his breast and so avenge  Insulted royalty O holy men  Ye are the sons of piety and peace  Ye never felt the sharp vindictive spur  That goads the injur'd warrior the hot tide  That flushes crimson on the conscious cheek  Of him who burns for glory else indeed  Ye much would pity me would curse the fate  That coops me here inactive in your groves  Robs me of hope tells me this trusty steel  Must never cleave one Roman helm again  Never avenge my queen nor free my country  CHORUS  'Tis heav'n's high will  CARACTACUS  I know it reverend fathers  'Tis heav'n's high will that these poor aged eyes  Shall never more behold that virtuous woman  To whom my youth was constant 'twas heav'n's will  To take her from me at that very hour  When best her love might sooth me that black hour  May memory ever raze it from her records  When all my squadrons fled and left their king  Old and defenceless him who nine whole years  Had stemm'd all Rome with their firm phallanx yes  For nine whole years my friends I bravely led  The valiant veterans oft to victory  Never 'till then to shame Bear with me Druid  I've done begin the rites  CHORUS  O would to heav'n  A frame of mind more fitted to these rites  Possest thee Prince that Resignation meek  That doveey'd Peace handmaid of Sanctity  Approach'd this altar with thee 'stead of these  See I not gaunt Revenge ensanguin'd Slaughter  And mad Ambition clinging to thy soul  Eager to snatch thee back to their domain  Back to a vain and miserable world  Whose misery and vanity tho' try'd  Thou still hold'st dearer than these solemn shades  Where Quiet reigns with Virtue Try we yet  What Holiness can do for much it can  Much is the potency of pious prayer  And much the sacred influence convey'd  By sage mysterious office when the soul  Snatch'd by the power of musick from her cell  Of fleshly thraldom feels herself upborn  On plumes of extasy and boldly springs  'Mid swelling harmonies and pealing hymns  Up to the porch of heav'n Strike then ye Bards  Strike all your strings symphonious wake a strain  May penetrate may purge may purify  His yet unhallow'd bosom call ye hither  The airy tribe that on yon mountain dwell  Ev'n on majestic Snowdon they who never  Deign visit mortal men save on some cause  Of highest import but fublimely shrin'd  On it's hoar top in domes of crystaline ice  Hold converse with those spirits that possess  The skies pure sapphire nearest heav'n itself  ODE  I  MONA on Snowdon calls  Hear thou King of mountains hear  Hark she speaks from all her strings  Hark her loudest echo rings  King of mountains bend thine ear  Send thy spirits send them soon  Now when Midnight and the Moon  Meet upon thy front of snow  See their gold and ebon rod  Where the sober sisters nod  And greet in whispers sage and slow  Snowdon mark 'tis Magic's hour  Now the mutter'd spell hath pow'r  Pow'r to rend thy ribs of rock  And burst thy base with thunder's shock  But to thee no ruder spell  Shall Mona use than those that dwell  In music's secret cells and lie  Steep'd in the stream of harmony  I  Snowdon has heard the strain  Hark amid the wond'ring grove  Other harpings answer clear  Other voices meet our ear  Pinnions flutter shadows move  Busy murmurs hum around  Rustling vestments brush the ground  Round and round and round they go  Thro' the twilight thro' the shade  Mount the oak's majestic head  And gild the tufted misseltoe  Cease ye glittering race of light  Close your wings and check your flight  Here arrang'd in order due  Spread your robes of saffron hue  For lo with more than mortal fire  Mighty Mador smites the lyre  Hark he sweeps the masterstrings  Listen all  CHORUS  Break off a sullen smoak involves the altar  The central oak doth shake I hear the sound  Of steps prophane Caractacus retire  Bear off the victims Mona is polluted  SEMICHORUS  Father as we did watch the eastern side  We spied and instant seiz'd two stranger youths  Who in the bottom of a shadowy dell  Held earnest converse Britons do they seem  And of Brigantian race  CHORUS  Haste drag them hither  VELLINUS ELIDURUS CHORUS  O spare ye sage and venerable Druids  Your countrymen and sons  CHORUS  And are ye Britons  Unheard of profanation Rome herself  Ev'n impious Rome whom conquest makes more impious  Would not have dar'd so rashly O for words  Big with the fiercest force of execration  To blast the deed and doers  ELIDURUS  Spare the curse  Oh spare our youth  CHORUS  Is it not now the hour  The holy hour when to the cloudless height  Of yon starr'd concave climbs the fullorb'd moon  And to this nether world in solemn stillness  Gives sign that to the list'ning ear of Heav'n  Religion's voice should plead the very babe  Knows this and chance awak'd his little hands  Lifts to the gods and on his innocent couch  Calls down a blessing Shall your manly years  Plead ignorance and impiously presume  To press with vile unconsecrated feet  On Mona's hallow'd plain know wretches know  At any hour such boldness is a crime  At this 'tis sacrilege  VELLINUS  Were Mona's plain  More hallow'd still hallow'd as is Heav'n's self  The cause might plead our pardon  ELIDURUS  Mighty Druid  True we have rashly dar'd yet forc'd by duty  Our sov'reign's mandate  VELLINUS  Elder by my birth  Brother I claim in right of eldership  To open our high embassy  CHORUS  Speak then  But see thy words answer in honest weight  To this proud prelude Youth they must be weighty  T' atone for such a crime  VELLINUS  If then to give  New nerves to vanquish'd valour if to do  What with the blessing of the Gods may save  A bleeding country from oppression's sword  Be weighty business know on our commission  And on it's hop'd success that weight depends  CHORUS  Declare it then at once briefly and boldly  VELLINUS  Caractacus is here  CHORUS  Say'st thou proud boy  'Tis boldly said and grant 'twere truly said  Think'st thou he were not here from fraud or force  As safe as 'midst a camp of conquerors  Here youth he would be guarded by the gods  Their own high hostage and each sacred hair  Of his selected head would in these caverns  Sleep with the unsunn'd silver of the mine  As precious and as safe record the time  When Mona e'er betray'd the hapless wretch  That made her groves his refuge  VELLINUS  Holy Druid  Think not so harshly of our enterprize  Can force alas dwell in our unarm'd hands  Can fraud in our young bosoms No dread seer  Our business told I trust thou'lt soon disclaim  The vain suspicion and thy holy ear  Be brave Caractacus or here or absent  Shall instant learn it From the north we come  The sons of her whose heav'nintrusted sway  Blesses the bold Brigantes men who firmly  Have three long moons withstood those Roman powers  Which led by fell Ostorius still assail  Our frontiers yet so oft have our stout swords  Repell'd their hot assault that now like falcons  They hang suspended loth to quit their prey  Nor daring yet to seize it Such the state  Of us and Rome 'mid which our prudent mother  Revolving what might to her people's weal  Best sink the dubious scale gave us swift charge  To seek the great Caractacus and call  His valour to her aid to lead her bands  To fight the cause of liberty and Britain  And quell these ravagers  Caractacus starts from behind the altar  CARACTACUS VELLINUS ELIDURUS CHORUS  And ye have found me  Friends ye have found me lead me to your Queen  And the last purple drop in these old veins  Shall fall for her and Britain  CHORUS  Rash rash Prince  VELLINUS  Ye blest immortal pow'rs is this the man  The more than man who for nine bloody years  Withstood all Rome He is that warlike front  Seam'd o'er with honest scars proclaims he is  Kneel brother kneel while in his royal hand  We lodge the signet this in pledge of faith  Great Cartismandua sends and with it tells thee  She has a nobler pledge than this behind  Thy Queen  CARACTACUS  Guideria  VELLINUS  Safely with our mother  CARACTACUS  How when where rescued mighty Gods I thank ye  For it is true this signet speaks it true  O tell me briefly  VELLINUS  In a sally Prince  Which wanting abler chiefs my gracious mother  Committed to my charge our troops assail'd  One outwork of the camp the mask of night  Favour'd our arms and there my happy hand  Was doom'd 'mid other prisoners to release  The captive matron  CARACTACUS  Let me clasp thee youth  And thou shalt be my son I had one stranger  Just of thy years he look'd like thee right honest  Had just that freeborn boldness on his brow  And yet he fail'd me Were it not for him  Who as thou seest ev'n at this hour of joy  Draws tears down mine old cheek I were as blest  As the great gods Oh he has all disgrac'd  His highborn ancestry But I'll forget him  Haste Evelina barb my knotty spear  Bind fast this trusty falchion to my thigh  My bow my target  CHORUS  Rash Caractacus  What hast thou done What dost thou mean to do  CARACTACUS  To save my country  CHORUS  To betray thyself  That thou hast done the rest thou canst not do  If Heav'n forbids and of it's awful will  Thy fury recks not Has the bleeding victim  Pour'd a propitious stream the milkwhite steeds  Unrein'd and neighing pranc'd with fav'ring steps  Say when these youths approach'd did not a gust  Of livid smoak involve the bickering flame  Did not the forest tremble every omen  Led thee to doubt their honesty of purpose  And yet before their tongues could tell that purpose  Ere I had tender'd as our laws ordain  Their test of faith thy rudeness rush'd before me  Infringing my just rights  CARACTACUS  Druid methinks  At such a time in such a cause Reproof  Might bait it's sternness Now by Heav'n I feel  Beyond all omens that within my breast  That marshals me to conquest something here  That snatches me beyond all mortal fears  Lifts me to where upon her jasper throne  Sits flamerob'd Victory who calls me son  And crowns me with a palm whose deathless green  Shall bloom when Caesar's fades  CHORUS  Vain confidence  CARACTACUS  Yet I submit in all  CHORUS  'Tis meet thou should'st  Thou art a King a sov'reign o'er frail man  I am a Druid servant of the Gods  Such service is above such sov'reignty  As well thou know'st if they should prompt these lips  To interdict the thing thou dar'st to do  What would avail thy daring  CARACTACUS  Holy man  But thou wilt bless it Heav'n will bid thee bless it  Thou know'st that when we fight to save our country  We fight the cause of Heav'n The man that falls  Falls hallow'd falls a victim for the Gods  For them and for their altars  CHORUS  Valiant Prince  Think not we lightly rate our country's weal  Or thee our country's champion Well we know  The glorious meed of those exalted souls  Who flame like thee for freedom mark me Prince  The time will come when Destiny and Death  Thron'd in a burning car the thund'ring wheels  Arm'd with gigantic scythes of adamant  Shall scour this field of life and in their rear  The fiend Oblivion kingdoms empires worlds  Melt in the general blaze when lo from high  Andraste darting catches from the wreck  The roll of fame claps her ascending plumes  And stamps on orient stars each patriot name  Round her eternal dome  CARACTACUS  Speak ever thus  And I will hear thee 'till attention faint  In heedless extasy  CHORUS  This tho' we know  Let man beware with headlong zeal to rush  Where slaughter calls it is not courage Prince  No nor the pride and practis'd skill in arms  That gains this meed the warrior is no patriot  Save when obsequious to the will of Heav'n  He draws the sword of vengeance  CARACTACUS  Surely Druid  Such fair occasion speaks the will of Heav'n  CHORUS  Monarch perchance thou hast a fair occasion  But if thou hast the Gods will soon declare it  Their sov'reign will thou know'st not this to learn  Demands our search Ye mortals all retire  Leave ye the grove to us and Inspiration  Nor let a step or ev'n one glance prophane  Steal from your caverns stay my holy brethren  Ye timeennobled Seers whose rev'rend brows  Full eighty winters whiten you ye Bards  Leoline Cadwall Hoel Cantaber  Attend upon our slumbers Wondrous men  Ye whose skill'd fingers know how best to lead  Thro' all the maze of sound the wayward step  Of Harmony recalling oft and oft  Permitting her unbridled course to rush  Thro' dissonance to concord sweetest then  Ev'n when expected harshest Mador thou  Alone shalt lift thy voice no choral peal  Shall drown thy solemn warblings thou best know'st  That opiate charm which lulls corporeal sense  Thou hast the key great Bard that best can ope  The portal of the soul unlock it strait  And lead the pensive pilgrim on her way  Thro' the vast regions of futurity  Exeunt Caractacus Vellinus  c c  ODE  I  HAIL thou harp of Phrygian frame  In years of yore that Camber bore  From Troy's sepulchral flame  With ancient Brute to Britain's shore  The mighty minstrel came  Sublime upon the burnish'd prow  He bad thy manly modes to flow  Britain heard the descant bold  She flung her white arms o'er the sea  Proud in her leafy bosom to unfold  The freight of harmony  I  Mute 'till then was ev'ry plain  Save where the flood 'mid mountains rude  Tumbled his tide amain  And echo from th' impending wood  Resounded the hoarse strain  While from the north the sullen gale  With hollow whistlings shook the vale  Dismal notes and answer'd soon  By savage howl the heaths among  What time the wolf doth bay the trembling moon  And thin the bleating throng  I  Thou spak'st imperial Lyre  The rough roar ceas'd and airs from high  Lapt the land in extasy  Fancy the fairy with thee came  And Inspiration brightey'd dame  Oft at thy call would leave her sapphire sky  And if not vain the verse presumes  Ev'n now some chast Divinity is near  For lo the sound of distant plumes  Pants thro' the pathless desart of the air  'Tis not the flight of her  'Tis Sleep her dewy harbinger  Change my harp O change thy measures  Cull from thy mellifluous treasures  Notes that steal on even feet  Ever slow yet never pausing  Mixt with many a warble sweet  In a ling'ring cadence closing  While the pleas'd power sinks gently down the skies  And seals with hand of down the Druids slumb'ring eyes  II  Thrice I pause and thrice I sound  The central string and now I ring  By measur'd lore profound  A sevenfold chime and sweep and swing  Above below around  To mix thy music with the spheres  That warble to immortal ears  Inspiration hears the call  She rises from her throne above  And sudden as the glancing meteors fall  She comes she fills the grove  II  High her port her waving hand  A pencil bears the days the years  Arise at her command  And each obedient colouring wears  So where Time's pictur'd band  In hues aethereal glide along  O mark the transitory throng  Now they dazzle now they die  Instant they flit from light to shade  Mark the blue forms of faint futurity  O mark them ere they fade  II  Whence was that inward groan  Why bursts thro' closed lids the tear  Why uplifts the bristling hair  It's white and venerable shade  Why down the consecrated head  Courses in chilly drops the dews of fear  All is not well the paleey'd moon  Curtains her head in clouds the stars retire  Save from the sultry south alone  The swart star flings his pestilential fire  Ev'n Sleep herself will fly  If not recall'd by harmony  Wake my lyre thy softest numbers  Such as nurse ecstatic slumbers  Sweet as tranquil virtue feels  When the toil of life is ending  While from earth the spirit steals  And on newborn plumes ascending  Hastens to lave in the bright fount of day  'Till Destiny prepare a shrine of purer clay  The Druid waking speaks  CHORUS  It may not be Avaunt terrific ax  Why hangs thy bright edge glaring o'er the grove  O for a giant's nerve to ward the stroke  It bows it falls  Where am I hush my soul  'Twas all a dream Resume no more the strain  The hour is past my brethren what ye saw  If what ye saw as by your looks I read  Bore like illomen'd shape hold it in silence  The midnight air falls chilly on my breast  And now I shiver now a fev'rish glow  Scorches my vitals Hark some step approaches  EVELINA CHORUS  Thus with my wayward fears to burst unbidden  On your dread synod rousing as ye seem  From holy trance appears a desperate deed  Ev'n to the wretch who dares it  CHORUS  Virgin quickly  Pronounce the cause  EVELINA  Bear with a simple maid  Too prone to fear perchance my fears are vain  CHORUS  But yet declare them  EVELINA  I suspect me much  The faith of these Brigantes  CHORUS  Say'st thou Virgin  Heed what thou say'st Suspicion is a guest  That in the breast of man of ireful man  Too oft' his welcome finds yet seldom sure  In that submissive calm that smooths the mind  Of maiden innocence  EVELINA  I know it well  Yet must I still distrust the elder stranger  For while he talks and much the flatterer talks  His brothers silent carriage gives disproof  Of all his boast indeed I mark'd it well  And as my father with the elder held  Bold speech and warlike as is still his wont  When fir'd with hope of conquest oft I saw  A sigh unbidden heave the younger's breast  Half check'd as it was rais'd sometimes methought  His gentle eye would cast a glance on me  As if he pitied me and then again  Would fasten on my father gazing there  To veneration then he'd sigh again  Look on the ground and hang his modest head  Most pensively  CHORUS  This may demand my breth'ren  More serious search Virgin proceed  EVELINA  'Tis true  My father rapt in high heroic zeal  His ev'ry thought big with his country's freedom  Heeds not the different carriage of these brethren  The elder takes him wholly yet methinks  The younger's manners have I know not what  That speaks him far more artless This besides  Is it not strange if as the tale reports  My mother sojourns with this distant queen  She should not send or to my sire or me  Some fond remembrance of her love ah none  With tears I speak it none not her dear blessing  Has reach'd my longing ears  CHORUS  The gods my brethren  Have wak'd these doubts in the untainted breast  Of this mild maiden oft to female softness  Oft to the purity of virgin souls  Doth heav'n it's voluntary light dispense  When victims bleed in vain They must be spies  Hie thee good Cantaber and to our presence  Summon the young Brigantian  EVILINA  Do not that  Or if ye do yet treat him nothing sternly  The softest terms from such a tender breast  Will draw confession and if ye shall find  The treason ye suspect forbear to curse him  Not that my weakness means to guide your wisdom  Yet as I think he would not wittingly  E'er do a deed of baseness were it granted  That I might question him my heart forbodes  It more could gain by gentleness and prayers  Than will the fiercest threats  CHORUS  Perchance it may  And quickly shalt thou try But see the King  And with him both the youths  EVILINA  Alas my fears  Forewent my errand else had I inform'd thee  That therefore did I come and from my father  To gain admission Mark the younger Druid  How sad he seems oft did he in the cave  So fold his arms  CHORUS  We mark him much and much  The elder's free and dreadless confidence  Virgin retire a while in yonder vale  Nor 'till thy royal father quits the grove  Resume thy station here  Exit Evilina  CARACTACUS CHORUS VELLINUS ELIDURUS  Forgive me Druid  My eager soul no longer could sustain  The pangs of expectation hence I sent  The virgin innocence of Evilina  Safest to break upon your privacy  She not return'd O pardon that uncall'd  I follow the great cause I trust absolves me  'Tis your's 'tis freedom's 'tis the cause of heav'n  And sure heav'n owns it such  CHORUS  Caractacus  All that by sage and sanctimonious rites  Might of the gods be ask'd we have essay'd  And yet nor to our wish nor to their wont  Gave they benign assent  CARACTACUS  Death to our hopes  CHORUS  While yet we lay in sacred slumber tranc'd  Sullen and sad to fancy's frighted eye  Did shapes of dun and murky hue advance  In train tumultuous all of gesture strange  And passing horrible starting we wak'd  Yet felt no waking calm still all was dark  Still rang our tinkling ears with screams of woe  Suspicious tremors still  VELLINUS  Of what suspicious  Druid our Queen  CHORUS  Restrain thy wayward tongue  Insolent youth in such licentious mood  To interupt our speech ill suits thy years  And worse our sanctity  CARACTACUS  'Tis his distress  Makes him forget what else his reverent zeal  Would pay ye holily Think what he feels  Poor youth who fears yon moon before she wanes  May see his country conquer'd see his mother  The victor's slave her royal blood debas'd  Dragging her chains thro' the throng'd streets of Rome  To grace oppression's triumph Horrid thought  Say can it be that he whose strenuous youth  Adds vigor to his virtue e'er can bear  This patiently he comes to ask my aid  And that witheld as now he needs must fear  What means alas are left search Britain round  What chief dares cope with Rome what king but holds  His loan of power at a Proconsul's will  At best a scepter'd slave  VELLINUS  Yes Monarch yes  If Heav'n restrains thy formidable sword  Or to it's stroke denies that just success  Which Heav'n alone can give I fear me much  Our Queen ourselves nay Britain's self must perish  CARACTACUS  But is not this a fear makes Virtue vain  Tears from yon ministring regents of the sky  Their right Plucks from firmhanded Providence  The golden reins of sublunary sway  And gives them to blind Chance If this be so  If Tyranny must lord it o'er the earth  There's Anarchy in Heav'n Nay frown not Druid  I do not think 'tis thus  CHORUS  We trust thou dost not  CARACTACUS  Masters of Wisdom No my soul confides  In that allhealing and allforming Power  Who on the radiant day when Time was born  Cast his broad eye upon the wild of ocean  And calm'd it with a glance then plunging deep  His mighty arm pluck'd from it's dark domain  This throne of Freedom lifted it to light  Girt it with silver cliffs and call'd it Britain  He did and will preserve it  CHORUS  Pious Prince  In that allhealing and allforming power  Still let thy soul confide but not in men  No not in these ingenuous as they seem  'Till they are try'd by that high test of faith  Our ancient laws ordain  VELLINUS  Illustrious Seer  Methinks our Sov'reign's signet well might plead  Her envoy's faith Thy pardon mighty Druid  Not for ourselves but for our Queen we plead  Mistrusting us ye wound her honour  CHORUS  Peace  Our will admits no parly Thither Youths  Turn your astonish'd eyes behold yon huge  And unhewn sphere of living adamant  Which pois'd by magic rests it's central weight  On yonder pointed rock firm as it seems  Such is it's strange and virtuous property  It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch  Of him whose breast is pure but to a traytor  Tho ev'n a giant's prowess nerv'd his arm  It stands as fixt as Snowdon No reply  The Gods command that one of you must now  Approach and try it in your snowy vests  Ye Priests involve the lots and to the younger  As is our wont tender the choice of Fate  ELIDURUS  Heav'ns is it fall'n on me  CHORUS  Young Prince it is  Prepare thee for thy tryal  ELIDURUS  Gracious Gods  Who may look up to your tremendous thrones  And say his breast is pure Allsearching Powers  Ye know already how and what I am  And what ye mean to publish me in Mona  To that I yield and tremble  CARACTACUS  Rouse thee Youth  And with that courage honest Truth supplies  For sure ye both are true haste to the tryal  Behold I lead thee on  CHORUS  Prince we arrest  Thy hasty step to witness this high test  Pertains to us alone Awhile retire  And in yon cave his brother be thy charge  The tryal past again will we confer  Touching that part which Heav'n's deciding choice  Wills thee to act  Exeunt Caractacus and Vellinus  CHORUS ELIDURUS  Now be the rites prepar'd  And now ye Bards chaunt ye that custom'd hymn  The prelude of this fam'd solemnity  ODE  I  THOU Spirit pure that spread'st unseen  Thy pinions o'er this pond'rous sphere  And breathing thro' each rigid vein  Fill'st with stupendous life the marble mass  And bid'st it bow upon it's base  When sov'reign Truth is near  Spirit invisible to thee  We swell the solemn harmony  Hear us and aid  Thou that in Virtue's cause  O'errulest Nature's laws  O hear and aid with influence high  The sons of Peace and Piety  I  Firstborn of that aethereal tribe  Call'd into birth ere time or place  Whom wave nor wind can circumscribe  Heirs of the liquid liberty of Light  That float on rainbow pennons bright  Thro' all the wilds of space  Yet thou alone of all thy kind  Canst range the regions of the mind  Thou only know'st  That dark meandring maze  Where wayward Falshood strays  And seizing swift the lurking sprite  Forces her forth to shame and light  I  Thou canst enter the dark cell  Where the vulture Conscience slumbers  And unarm'd by charming spell  Or magic numbers  Canst rouse her from her formidable sleep  And bid her dart her raging talons deep  Yet ah too seldom doth the furious fiend  Thy bidding wait vindictive selfprepar'd  She knows her tort'ring time too sure to rend  The trembling heart when Virtue quits her guard  Pause then celestial guest  And brooding on thine adamantine sphere  If fraud approach Spirit that fraud declare  To Conscience and to Mona leave the rest  CHORUS  Heard'st thou the awful invocation Youth  Wrapt in those holy harpings  ELIDURUS  Sage I did  And it came o'er my soul as doth the thunder  While distant yet it with expected burst  Threatens the trembling ear Now to the tryal  CHORUS  Ere that bethink thee well what rig'rous doom  Threatens thine act if failing certain death  So certain that in our absolving tongues  Rests not that power may save thee Thou must die  EVILINA ELIDURUS CHORUS  Die say'st thou Druid  ELIDURUS  Evilina here  Lead to the rock  CHORUS  No youth a while we spare thee  And in our stead permit this royal maiden  To urge thee first with virgin gentleness  Respect our clemency and meet her questions  With answers prompt and true so may'st thou 'scape  A sterner tryal  ELIDURUS  Rather to the rock  EVILINA  Dost thou disdain me Prince Lost as I am  Methinks the daughter of Caractacus  Might merit milder treatment I was born  To royal hopes and promise nurs'd i'th' lap  Of soft prosperity alas the change  I meant but to address a few brief words  To this young Prince and he doth turn his eye  And scorns to answer me  ELIDURUS  Scorn thee sweet Maid  No 'tis the fear  EVILINA  And canst thou fear me Youth  Ev'n while I led a life of royalty  I bore myself to all with meek deportment  In nothing harsh or cruel and howe'er  Misfortune works upon the minds of men  For some they say it turns to very stone  Mine I am sure it softens Wert thou guilty  Yet I should pity thee nay wert thou leagu'd  To load this suffering heart with more misfortunes  Still should I pity thee nor e'er believe  Thou would'st on free and voluntary choice  Betray the innocent  ELIDURUS  Indeed I would not  EVILINA  No gracious Youth I do believe thou would'st not  For on thy brow the liberal hand of Heav'n  Has portray'd Truth as visible and bold  As were the pictur'd suns that deckt the brows  Of our brave ancestors Say then young Prince  For therefore have I wish'd to question thee  Bring ye no token of a mother's fondness  To her expecting child Gentle thou seemest  And sure that gentleness would prompt thine heart  To visit and to sooth with courteous office  Distress like her's A captive and a queen  Has more than common claim for pity Prince  And ev'n the ills of venerable age  Were cause enough to move thy tender nature  The tears o'ercharge thine eye Alas my fears  Sickness or sore infirmity had seiz'd her  Before thou left'st the palace else her lips  Had to thy care intrusted some kind message  And blest her hapless daughter by thy tongue  Would she were here  ELIDURUS  Would Heav'n she were  EVILINA  Ah why  ELIDURUS  Because you wish it  EVILINA  Thanks ingenuous youth  For this thy courtesy Yet if the queen  Thy mother shines with such rare qualities  As late thy brother boasted she will calm  Her woes and I shall clasp her aged knees  Again in peace and libertyAlas  He speaks not all my fears are just  ELIDURUS  What fears  The Queen Guideria is not dead  EVILINA  Not dead  But is she in that sacred state of freedom  Which we were taught to hope Why sigh'st thou Youth  Thy years have yet been prosp'rous Did thy father  E'er lose his kingdom Did captivity  E'er seize thy shrieking mother thou can'st go  To yonder cave and find thy brother safe  He is not lost as mine is Youth thou sigh'st  Again thou hast not sure such cause for sorrow  But if thou hast give me thy griefs I pray thee  I have a heart can softly sympathize  And sympathy is soothing  ELIDURUS  O gods gods  She tears my soul What shall I say  EVILINA  Perchance  For all in this bad world must have their woes  Thou too hast thine and may'st like me be wretched  Haply amid the ruinous waste of war  'Mid that wild havock which these sons of blood  Bring on our groaning country some chaste maid  Whose tender soul was link'd by love to thine  Might fall the trembling prey to Roman rage  Ev'n at the golden hour when holy rites  Had seal'd your virtuous vows If it were so  Indeed I pity her  ELIDURUS  Not that not that  Never 'till now did beauty's matchless beam  But I am dumb  EVILINA  Why that dejected eye  And why this silence that some weighty grief  O'erhangs thy soul thy ev'ry look proclaims  Why then refuse it words The heart that bleeds  From any stroak of fate or human wrongs  Loves to disclose itself that list'ning pity  May drop a healing tear upon the wound  'Tis only when with inbred horror smote  At some base act or done or to be done  That the recoiling soul with conscious dread  Shrinks back into itself But thou good youth  ELIDURUS  Cease royal maid permit me to depart  EVILINA  Yet hear me stranger Truth and Secrecy  Tho' friends are seldom necessary friends  ELIDURUS  I go to try my truth  EVILINA  O go not hence  In wrath think not that I suspect thy virtue  Yet ignorance may oft make virtue slide  And if  ELIDURUS  In pity spare me  EVILINA  If thy brother  Nay start not do not turn thine eye from mine  Speak I conjure thee is his purpose honest  I know the guilty price that barbarous Rome  Sets on my father's head and gold vile gold  Has now a charm for Britons Brib'd by this  Should he betray himYes I see thou shudder'st  At the dire thought yet not as if 'twere strange  But as our fears were mutual Ah young stranger  That open face scarce needs a tongue to utter  What works within Come then ingenuous Prince  And instant make discovery to the Druid  While yet 'tis not too late  ELIDURUS  Ah what discover  Say whom must I betray  EVILINA  Thy brother  ELIDURUS  Ha  EVILINA  Who is no brother if his guilty soul  Teems with such perfidy O all ye stars  Can he be brother to a youth like thee  Who would betray an old and honour'd King  That King his countryman and one whose prowess  Once guarded Britain 'gainst th' assailing world  Can he be brother to a youth like thee  Who from a young defenceless innocent maid  Would take that King her father Make her suffer  All that an orphan suffers More perchance  The ruffian foeO tears ye choak my utterance  Can he be brother to a youth like thee  Who would defile his soul by such black deeds  It cannot beAnd yet thou still are silent  Turn youth and see me weep Ah see me kneel  I am of royal blood not wont to kneel  Yet will I kneel to thee O save my father  Save a distressful maiden from the force  Of barbarous men Be thou a brother to me  For mine alas hah    Sees Arviragus entring  ARVIRAGUS EVILINA ELIDURUS CHORUS  Evilina rise  Know maid I ne'er will tamely see thee kneel  Ev'n at the foot of Caesar  EVILINA  'Tis himself  And he will prove my father's fears were false  False as his son is brave Thou best of brothers  Come to my arms Where hast thou been thou wanderer  How wer't thou sav'd indeed Arviragus  I never shed such tears since thou wer't lost  For these are tears of rapture  ARVIRAGUS  Evelina  Fain would I greet thee as a brother ought  But wherefore did'st thou kneel  EVELINA  O ask not now  ARVIRAGUS  By heav'n I must and he must answer me  Who'er he be What art thou sullen stranger  ELIDURUS  A Briton  ARVIRAGUS  Brief and bold  EVELINA  Ah spare the taunt  He merits not thy wrath Behold the Druids  Lo they advance with holy reverence first  Thou must address their sanctity  ARVIRAGUS  I will  But see proud Boy thou dost not quit the grove  Till Time allows us parley  ELIDURUS  Prince I mean not  ARVIRAGUS  Sages and Sons of Heav'n Illustrious Druids  Abruptly I approach your sacred Presence  Yet such dire tidings  CHORUS  On thy peril peace  Thou standst accus'd and by a Father's voice  Of crimes abhorr'd of Cowardice and Flight  And therefore mayst not in these sacred groves  Utter polluted accents Quickly say  Wherefore thou fledst For that base fact unclear'd  We hold no further converse  ARVIRAGUS  O ye Gods  Am I the Son of your Caractacus  And could I fly  CHORUS  Waste not or Time or Words  But tell us why thou fledst  ARVIRAGUS  I fled not Druid  By the great Gods I fled not Save to stop  Our dastard troops that bafely turn'd their backs  I stopt I rallied them when lo a shaft  Of random cast did level me with Earth  Where pale and senseless as the slain around me  I lay till midnight Then as from long trance  Awoke I crawl'd upon my feeble Limbs  To a lone cottage where a pitying Hind  Lodg'd me and nourish'd me My strength repair'd  It boots not that I tell what humble arts  Compell'd I us'd to screen me from the foe  How now a peasant from a beggarly scrip  I sold cheap food to slaves that nam'd the price  Nor after gave it Now a Minstrel poor  With illtun'd Harp and uncouth descant shrill  I ply'd a thriftless trade and by such shifts  Did win Obscurity to shroud my name  At length to other conquests in the north  Ostorius led his legions Safer now  Yet not secure I to some valiant Chiefs  Whom War had spar'd discover'd what I was  And with them plan'd how surest we might draw  Our scatter'd forces to some rocky fastness  In rough Caernarvon there to breathe in freedom  If not with brave incursion to oppress  The thinlystation'd foe And soon our art  So well avail'd that now at Snowdon's foot  Full twenty troops of hardy veterans wait  To call my Sire their leader  CHORUS  Valiant Youth  EVELINA  He isI said he was a valiant Youth  Nor has he sham'd his race  CHORUS  We do believe  Thy modest tale And may the righteous Gods  Thus ever shed upon thy noble breast  Discretion's cooling dew When nurtur'd so  Then only then doth Valour bloom mature  ARVIRAGUS  Yet vain is Valour howsoe'er it bloom  Druid the Gods frown on us All my hopes  Are blasted I shall ne'er rejoin my Friends  Ne'er bless them with my Father Holy Men  I have a tale to tell will shake your Souls  Your Mona is invaded Rome approaches  E'en to these Groves approaches  SEMICHORUS  Horror Horror  ARVIRAGUS  Late as I landed on you highest beach  Where nodding from the rocks the Poplars fling  Their scatter'd arms and dash them in the wave  There were their Vessels moor'd as if they sought  Concealment 'mid the shade and as I past  Up you thickplanted ridge I spy'd their helms  'Mid brakes and boughs trench'd in the heath below  Where like a nest of nightworms did they glitter  Sprinkling the plain with brightness On I sped  With silent step yet oft did pass so near  'Twas next to prodigy I 'scap'd unseen  CHORUS  Their number Prince  ARVIRAGUS  Few if mine hasty Eye  Did find and count them all  CHORUS  O Brethren Brethren  Treason and sacrilege worse foes than Rome  Have led Rome hither Instant seize that wretch  And bring him to our presence  CHORUS ELIDURUS ARVIRAGUS  Say thou false one  What doom befits the slave who sells his country  ELIDURUS  Death sudden death  CHORUS  No ling'ring peacemeal death  And to such death thy brother and thyself  We now devote Villain thy deeds are known  'Tis known ye led the impious Romans hither  To slaughter us ev'n on our holy Altars  ELIDURUS  That on my soul doth lie some secret grief  These looks perforce will tell It is not fear  Druids it is not fear that shakes me thus  The great Gods know it is not Ye can never  For what tho' Wisdom lifts ye next those Gods  Ye cannot like to them unlock Mens breasts  And read their inmost thoughts Ah that ye could  ARVIRAGUS  What hast thou done  ELIDURUS  What Prince I will not tell  CHORUS  Wretch there are means  ELIDURUS  I know and terrible means  And 'tis both fit that you should try those means  And I endure them Yet I think my patience  Will for some space baffle your torturing fury  CHORUS  Be that best known when our inflicted goads  Harrow thy flesh  ARVIRAGUS  Stranger e'er this is try'd  Confess the whole of thy black perfidy  So black that when I look upon thy youth  Read thy mild eye and mark thy modest brow  I think indeed thou durst not  ELIDURUS  Such a crime  Indeed I durst not and would rather be  The very wretch thou seest I'll speak no more  CHORUS  Brethren 'tis so The Virgins thoughts were just  This Youth has been deceived  ELIDURUS  Yes one Word more  You say the Romans have invaded Mona  Give me a sword and twenty honest Britons  And I will quell those Romans Vain demand  Alas you cannot Ye are Men of Peace  Religion's self forbids Lead then to torture  ARVIRAGUS  Now on my Soul this Youth doth move me much  CHORUS  Think not Religion and our holy Office  Doth teach us tamely like the bleating Lamb  To crouch before Oppression and with neck  Outstretch'd await the stroke Mistaken Boy  Did not strict Justice claim thee for her Victim  We might full safely send thee to these Romans  Inviting their hot charge Know when I blow  That sacred Trumpet bound with sable fillets  To yonder branching Oak the awful sound  Calls forth a thousand Britons train'd alike  In holy and in martial exercise  Not by such mode and rule as Romans use  But of that fierce potentous horrible sort  As shall appall ev'n Romans  ELIDURUS  Gracious Gods  Then there are hopes indeed O call them instant  This Prince will lead them on I'll follow him  Tho' in my Chains and some way dash them round  To harm the haughty foe  ARVIRAGUS  A thousand Britons  And arm'd O instant blow the sacred trump  And let me head them Yet methinks this Youth  CHORUS  I know what thou wouldst say might join thee Prince  True were he free from crime or had confest  ELIDURUS  Confest Ah think not I will e'er  ARVIRAGUS  Reflect  Either thyself or brother must have wrong'd us  Then why conceal  ELIDURUS  Hast thou a Brother no  Else hadst thou spar'd the word and yet a sister  Lovely as thine might more than teach thee Prince  What 'tis to have a Brother Hear me Druids  Tho' I would prize an hour of Freedom now  Before an age of any after date  Tho' I would seize it as the gift of heav'n  And use it as heaven's gift yet do not think  I so will purchase it Give it me freely  I yet will spurn the boon and hug my Chains  Till you do swear by your own hoary heads  My Brother shall be safe  CHORUS  Excellent Youth  Thy words do speak thy soul and such a soul  As wakes our wonder Thou art free thy Brother  Shall be thine honour's pledge so will we use him  As thou art false or true  ELIDURUS  I ask no other  ARVIRAGUS  Thus then my fellow soldier to thy clasp  I give the hand of Friendship Noble Youth  We'll speed or die together  CHORUS  Hear us Prince  Mona permits not that he fight her battles  Till duly purified For tho his Soul  Took up unwittingly this deed of baseness  Yet is Lustration meet Learn that in Vice  There is a noisome rankness unperceiv'd  By gross corporeal sense which so offends  Heaven's pure Divinities as us the stench  Of vapour wafted from sulphureous pool  Or pois'nous weed obscene Hence doth the Man  Who ev'n converses with a villain need  As much purgation as the pallid wretch  'Scap'd from the walls where frowning Pestilence  Spreads wide her livid Banners For this cause  Ye Priests conduct the Youth to yonder grove  And do the needful rites    Exeunt Priests with Elidurus  Mean while ourself  Will lead thee Prince unto thy Father's presence  But hold the King comes forth  CARACTACUS ARVIRAGUS CHORUS EVELINA  My son My son  What joy what transport doth thine aged sire  Feel in these filial foldings Speak not boy  Nor interrupt that heartfelt ecstacy  Should strike us mute I know what thou wouldst say  Yet prithee peace Thy sister's voice hath clear'd thee  And could excuse find words at this blest moment  Trust me I'd give it vent But 'tis enough  Thy father welcomes thee to him and honour  Honour that now with rapt'rous certainty  Calls thee his own true offspring Dost thou weep  Ah if thy tears swell not from joy's free spring  I beg thee spare them I have done thee wrong  Can make thee no atonement None alas  Thy father scarce can bless thee as he ought  Unblest himself beset with Foes around  Bereft of queen of kingdom and of soldiers  He can but give thee portion of his dangers  Perchance and of his chains Yet droop not boy  Virtue is still thine own  ARVIRAGUS  It is my father  Pure as from thine illustrious fount it came  And that unsullied let the world oppress us  Let Fraud and Falshood rivet fetters on us  Still shall our souls be free Yet Hope is ours  As well as Virtue  CARACTACUS  Spoken like a Briton  True Hope is ours and therefore let's prepare  The moments now are precious Tell us Druid  Is it not meet we see the bands drawn out  And mark their due array  CHORUS  Monarch ev'n now  They skirt the grove  CARACTACUS  Then let us to their front  CHORUS  But is the traitoryouth in safety lodg'd  CARACTACUS  Druid he fled  CHORUS  O fatal flight to Mona  CARACTACUS  But what of that Arviragus is here  My son is here then let the traitor go  By this he has join'd the Romans Let him join them  A single arm and that a villain's arm  Can lend but little aid to any powers  Oppos'd to Truth and Virtue Come my son  Let's to the troops and marshall them with speed  That done we from these venerable men  Will claim their ready blessing Then to battle  And the swift sun ev'n at his purple dawn  Shall spy us crown'd with conquest or with death    Exeunt Caractacus and Arviragus  CHORUS EVELINA  What may his flight portend Say Evelina  How came this youth to 'scape  EVELINA  And that to tell  Will fix much blame on my impatient folly  For ere your hallow'd lips had given permission  I flew with eager haste to bear my father  News of his son's return Enflam'd with that  Think how a sister's zealous breast must glow  Your looks give mild assent I glow'd indeed  With the dear tale and sped me in his ear  To pour the precious tidings But my tongue  Scarce nam'd Arviragus ere the false stranger  As I bethink me since with stealthy pace  Fled to the cavern's mouth  CHORUS  The king pursued  EVELINA  Alas he mark'd him not for 'twas the moment  When he had all to ask and all to fear  Touching my brother's valour Hitherto  His safety only which but little mov'd him  Had reach'd his ears But when my tongue unfolded  The story of his bravery and his peril  O how the tears cours'd plenteous down his cheeks  How did he lift unto the heav'ns his hands  In speechless transport Yet he soon bethought him  Of Rome's invasion and with fiery glance  Survey'd the cavern round then snatch'd his spear  And menac'd to pursue the flying traitor  But I with prayers O pardon if they err'd  Witheld his step for to the left the youth  Had wing'd his way where the thick underwood  Afforded sure retreat Besides if found  Was age a match for youth  CHORUS  Maiden enough  Better perchance for us if he was captive  But in the justice of their cause and heav'n  Do Mona's sons confide  BARD CHORUS ELIDURUS EVELINA  Druid the rites  Are finish'd all save that which crowns the rest  And which pertains to thy blest hand alone  For that he kneels before thee  CHORUS  Take him hence  We may not trust him forth to fight our cause  ELIDURUS  Now by Andraste's throne  CHORUS  Nay swear not youth  The tie is broke that held thy fealty  Thy brother's fled  ELIDURUS  Fled  CHORUS  To the Romans fled  Yes thou hast cause to tremble  ELIDURUS  Ah Vellinus  Does thus our love does thus our friendship end  Was I thy brother youth and hast thou left me  Yes and how left me cruel as thou art  The victim of thy crimes  CHORUS  True thou must die  ELIDURUS  I pray ye then on your best mercy Fathers  It may be speedy I would fain be dead  If this be life Yet I must doubt ev'n that  For falshood of this strange stupendous sort  Sets firmey'd Reason on a gaze mistrusting  That what she sees in palpable plain form  The stars in yon blue arch these woods these caverns  Are all mere tricks of cozenage nothing real  The vision of a vision If he's fled  I ought to hate this brother  CHORUS  Yet thou dost not  ELIDURUS  But when Astonishment will give me leave  Perchance I shallAnd yet he is my brother  And he was virtuous once Yes ye vile Romans  Yes I must die before my thirsty sword  Drinks one rich drop of vengeance Yet ye robbers  Yet will I curse you with my dying lips  'Twas you that stole away my brother's virtue  CHORUS  Now then prepare to die  ELIDURUS  I am prepar'd  Yet since I cannot now what most I wish'd  By manly prowess guard this lovely maid  Permit that on your holiest earth I kneel  And pour one fervent prayer for her protection  Allow me this for tho' you think me false  The gods will hear me  EVELINA  I can hold no longer  O Druid Druid at thy feet I fall  Yes I must plead away with virginblushes  For such a youth must plead I'll die to save him  O take my life and let him fight for Mona  CHORUS  Virgin arise His virtue hath redeem'd him  And he shall fight for thee and for his country  Youth thank us with thy deeds The time is short  And now with reverence take our high lustration  Thrice do we sprinkle thee with daybreak dew  Shook from the Maythorn blossom twice and thrice  Touch we thy forehead with our holy wand  Now thou art fully purg'd Now rise restor'd  To virtue and to us Hence then my son  Hie thee to yonder altar where our Bards  Shall arm thee duly both with helm and sword  For warlike enterprize    Exit Elidurus  CARACTACUS CHORUS ARVIRAGUS EVELINA  'Tis true my Son  Bold are their bearings and I fear me not  But they have hearts will not belie their looks  I like them well Yet would to righteous heav'n  Those valiant Veterans that on Snowdon guard  Their scanty pittance of bleak Liberty  Were here to join them we would teach these wolves  Tho' we permit their rage to prowl our coasts  That Vengeance waits them ere they rob our altars  Druid all hail we find thy valiant guards  Accoutred so as well bespeaks the wisdom  That fram'd their phalanx We but wait thy blessing  To lead them 'gainst the foe  CHORUS  Caractacus  Behold this sword The sword of old Belinus  Stain'd with the blood of giants and its name  TRIFINGUS Many an age its charmed blade  Has slept within you consecrated trunk  Lo I unsheath it king I wave it o'er thee  Mark what portentous streams of scarlet light  Flow from the brandish'd falchion On thy knee  Receive the sacred pledgeAnd mark our words  By the bright circle of the golden Sun  By the brief courses of the errant Moon  By the dread potency of every Star  In the mysterious Zodiac's burning girth  By each and all of these supernal signs  We do adjure thee with this trusty blade  To guard yon central oak whose holy stem  Involves the spirit of high Taranis  This be thy charge to which in aid we join  Ourselves and our sage brethren With our vassals  Thy son and the Brigantian prince shall make  Incursion on the foe  CARACTACUS  In this and all  Your holy will be done Yet surely Druid  The fresh and active vigour of these youths  Might better suit with this important charge  Not that my heart shrinks at the glorious task  But will with ready zeal pour forth its blood  Upon the sacred roots my firmest courage  Might fail to save Think Fathers I am old  And if I fell the foremost in the onset  Should leave a son behind might still defend you  CHORUS  The sacred adjuration we have utter'd  May never be recall'd  CARACTACUS  Then be it so  Yet do not think I counsel this thro' fear  Old as I am I trust with half our powers  I could drive back these Romans to their ships  Dastards that come as doth the cow'ring fowler  To tangle me with snares and take me tamely  Slaves they shall find that ere they gain their prey  They have to hunt it boldly with barb'd spears  And meet such conflict as the chafed boar  Gives to his stout assailants O ye gods  That I might instant face them  CHORUS  Be thy son's  The onset  ARVIRAGUS  From his soul that son doth thank ye  Blessing the wisdom that preserves his father  Thus to the last O if the fav'ring gods  Direct this arm if their high will permit  I pour a prosperous vengeance on the foe  I ask for life no longer than to crown  The valiant task Steel then ye powers of heav'n  Steel my firm soul with your own fortitude  Free from alloy of passion Give me courage  That knows not rage revenge that knows not malice  Let me not thirst for carnage but for conquest  And conquest gain'd sleep vengeance in my breast  Ere in its sheath my sword  CARACTACUS  O hear his father  If ever rashness spur'd me on great gods  To acts of danger thirsting for renown  If e'er my eager soul pursued its course  Beyond just reason's limit visit not  My faults on him I am the thing you made me  Vindictive bold precipitate and fierce  But as you gave to him a milder mind  O bless him bless him with a milder fate  EVELINA  Nor yet unheard let Evelina pour  Her pray'rs and tears O hear a hapless maid  That ev'n thro' half the years her life has number'd  Ev'n nine long years has drag'd a trembling being  Beset with pains and perils Give her peace  And to endear it more be that blest peace  Won by her brother's sword O bless his arm  And bless his valiant followers One and all  ELIDURUS  entering armed  Hear heav'n and let this pure and virgin prayer  Plead ev'n for Elidurus whose sad soul  Cannot look up to your immortal thrones  And urge his own request Else would he ask  That all the dangers of th' approaching fight  Might fall on him alone That every spear  The Romans wield might at his breast be aim'd  Each arrow darted on his rattling helm  That so the brother of this beauteous maid  Returning safe with victory and peace  Might bear them to her bosom  CHORUS  Now rise all  And heav'n that knows what most ye ought to ask  Grant all ye ought to have The stars on high  Are faded now and darkness reigns o'er all  Now is the dreadful hour now will our torches  Glare with more livid horror now our shrieks  And clanking arms will more appall the foe  But heed ye Bards that for the sign of onset  Ye sound the antientest of all your rhymes  Whose birth tradition notes not nor who fram'd  Its lofty strains The force of that high air  Did Julius feel when fir'd by it our fathers  First drove him recreant to his Ships and ill  Had far'd his second landing but that Fate  Silenc'd the master Bard who led the song  Now forth brave Pair Go with our blessing go  Mute be the march as ye ascend the hill  Then when ye hear the sound of our shrill trumpet  Fall on the foe  CARACTACUS  Now glory be thy guide  Pride of my soul go forth and conquer  EVELINA  Brother  Yet one embrace O thou much honour'd Stranger  I charge thee fight by my dear brother's side  And shield him from the foe for he is brave  And will with bold and welldirected arm  Return thy succour    Exeunt Arviragus and Elidurus  CHORUS  Now ye Priests  Strew on the altar's height your sacred leaves  And light the morning flame But why is this  Why doth our brother Mador snatch his harp  From yonder bough why this way bend his step  CARACTACUS  He is entranc'd The fillet bursts that bound  His liberal locks his snowy vestments fall  In ampler folds and all his floating form  Doth seem to glisten with divinity  Yet is he speechless Say thou Chief of Bards  What is there in this airy vacancy  That thou with fiery and irregular glance  Should'st scan thus wildly wherefore heaves thy breast  Why starts  ODE    Hark heard ye not yon footstep dread  That shook the earth with thund'ring tread  'Twas DeathIn haste  The Warrior past  High tower'd his helmed head  I mark'd his mail I mark'd his shield  I 'spi'd the sparkling of his spear  I saw his giantarm the falchion wield  Wide wav'd the bick'ring blade and fir'd the angry air    On me he cry'd my Britons wait  To lead you to the field of fate  I come Yon car  That cleaves the air  Descends to throne my state  I mount your Champion and your God  My proud steeds neigh beneath the thong  Hark to my wheels of brass that rattle loud  Hark to my  Here one of the Druids blows the sacred trumpet  clarion shrill that brays the woods among    Fear not now the fever's fire  Fear not now the deathbed groan  Pangs that torture pains that tire  Bedrid age with feeble moan  These domestic terrors wait  Hourly at my palace gate  And when o'er slothful realms my rod I wave  These on the tyrant king and coward slave Rush with vindictive rage and drag them to their grave    But you my Sons at this high hour  Shall share the fulness of my power  From all your bows  In level'd rows  My own dread shafts shall shower  Go then to conquest gladly go  Deal forth my dole of destiny  With all my fury dash the trembling foe  Down to those darksome dens where Rome's pale spectres lie    Where creeps the ninefold stream profound  Her black inexorable round  And on the bank  To willows dank  The shivering ghosts are bound  Twelve thousand crescents all shall swell  To fullorb'd pride and all decline  Ere they again in life's gay mansions dwell  Not such the meed that crowns the sons of freedom's line    No my Britons battleslain  Rapture gilds your parting hour  I that all despotic reign  Claim but there a moment's power  Swiftly the soul of British flame  Animates some kindred frame  Swiftly to life and light triumphant flies  Exults again in martial ecstacies  Again for freedom fights again for freedom dies  CARACTACUS  It does it does unconquer'd undismaid  The British soul revivesChampion lead on  I followgive me way Some blessed shaft  Will rid me of this clog of cumb'rous age  And I again shall in some happier mould  Rise to redeem my country  CHORUS  Stay thee Prince  And mark what clear and amberskirted clouds  Rise from the altar's verge and cleave the skies  O 'tis a prosperous omen Soon expect  To hear glad tidings  CARACTACUS  I will send them to thee  CHORUS  But see a Bard approaches and he bears them  Else is his eye no herald to his heart  BARD CHORUS CARACTACUS CARACTACUS  Speedily tell thy tale  BARD  A tale like mine  I trust your ears will willingly pursue  Thro' each glad circumstance First Monarch learn  The Roman troop is fled  CHORUS  Great gods we thank ye  CARACTACUS  Fought they not ere they fled O tell me all  BARD  Silent as night that wrapt us in her veil  We pac'd up yonder hill whose woody ridge  O'erhung the ambush'd foe No sound was heard  Step felt or sight descry'd for safely hid  Beneath the purple pall of sacrifice  Did sleep our holy fire nor saw the air  Till to that pass we came where whilom Brute  Planted his five hoar altars To our rites  Then swift we hasted and in one short moment  Each rocky pile was cloth'd with livid flame  Near each a whiterob'd Druid whose stern voice  Thunder'd deep execrations on the foe  Now wak'd our horrid symphony now all  Our harps terrific rang Meanwhile the grove  Trembled the altars shook and thro' our ranks  Our sacred sisters rush'd in sable robes  With hair dishevel'd and funereal brands  Hurl'd round with menacing fury On they rush'd  In fierce and frantic mood as is their wont  Amid the magic rites they do to night  In our deep dens below Motions like these  Were never dar'd before in open air  CHORUS  Did I not say we had a power within us  That might appall ev'n Romans  BARD  And it did  They stood agast and to our vollied darts  That thick as hail fell on their helms and corslets  Scarce rais'd a warding shield The sacred trumpet  Then rent the air and instant at the signal  Rush'd down Arviragus with all our vassals  A hot but shortliv'd conflict then ensued  For soon they fled I saw the Romans fly  Before I left the field  CARACTACUS  My son pursued  BARD  The prince and Elidurus like twin lions  Did side by side engage Death seem'd to guide  Their swords no stroke fell fruitless every wound  Gave him a victim  CARACTACUS  Thus my friend Ebrancus  Illfated prince didst thou and I in youth  Unite our valours In his prime he fell  On Conway's banks I saw him fall and slew  His murdererBut how far did they pursue  BARD  Ev'n to the ships For I descry'd the rout  Far as the twilight gleam would aid my sight  CARACTACUS  Now thanks to the bright star that rul'd his birth  Yes he will soon return to claim my blessing  And he shall have it pour'd in tears of joy  On his bold breast methought I heard a step  Is it not his  BARD  'Tis some of our own train  And as I think they lead six Romans captive  CHORUS CARACTACUS CAPTIVES  My brethren bear the prisoners to the cavern  Till we demand them  CARACTACUS  Pause ye yet a while  They seem of bold demeanor and have helms  That speak them leaders Hear me Romans hear  That you are captives is the chance of war  Yet captives as ye are in Britain's eye  You are not slaves Barbarians tho' you call us  We know the native rights man claims from man  And therefore never shall we gall your necks  With chains or drag you at our scythed cars  In arrogance of triumph Nor till taught  By Rome what Britain sure should scorn to learn  Her avarice will we barter ye for gold  True ye are captives and our country's safety  Forbids we give you back to liberty  We give ye therefore to the immortal gods  To them we lift ye in the radiant cloud  Of sacrifice They may in limbs of freedom  Replace your freeborn souls and their high mercy  Haply shall to some better world advance you  Or else in this restore that golden gift  Which lost leaves life a burden Does there breathe  A wretch so 'pall'd with the vain fear of death  Can call this cruelty 'tis love 'tis mercy  And grant ye gods if ere I'm made a captive  I meet the like fair treatment from the foe  Whose stronger star quells mine Now lead them on  And while they live treat them as men should men  And not as Rome treats Britain    Exeunt Captives  Druid these  Ev'n should their chief escape may blaze tomorrow  Our gratitudeWhence was that shriek  EVELINA CARACTACUS CHORUS  My father  Support me take me trembling to your arms  All is not well Ah me my fears o'ercome me  CARACTACUS  What means my child  EVELINA  Alas we are betray'd  Ev'n now as wand'ring in yon eastern grove  I call'd the gods to aid us the dread sound  Of many hasty steps did meet mine ear  This way they prest  CARACTACUS  Daughter thy fears are vain  EVELINA  Methought I saw the flame of lighted brands  And what did glitter to my dazzled sight  Like swords and helms  CARACTACUS  All all the feeble coinage  Of maiden fear  EVELINA  Nay if mine ear mistook not  I heard the traitor's voice who that way 'scap'd  Calling to arms  CARACTACUS  Away with idle terrors  Know thy brave brother's crest is crown'd with conquest  The Romans fled their leaders are our captives  Smile my lov'd child and imitate the sun  That rises ruddy from behind yon oaks  To hail him victor  CHORUS  That the rising sun  O horror horror sacrilegious fires  Devour our groves They blaze they blaze O sound  The trump again recall the prince or all  Is lost  CARACTACUS  Druid where is thy fortitude  Do not I live Is not this holy sword  Firm in my grasp I will preserve your groves  Britons I go Let those that dare die nobly  Follow my step    Exit Caractacus  EVELINA  O whither does he go  Return return Ye holy men recall him  What is his arm against a host of Romans  O I have lost a father  CHORUS  Ruthless gods  Ye take away our souls A general panic  Reigns thro' the grove O fly my brethren fly  To aid the king fly to preserve your altars  Alas 'tis all in vain our fate is fixt  Look there look there thou miserable maid  Behold thv bleeding brother  ARVIRAGUS ELIDURUS EVELINA CHORUS  Thanks good youth  Safe hast thou brought me to that holy spot  Where I did wish to die Support me still  O I am sick to death Yet one step more  Now lay me gently down I would drag out  This life tho' at some cost of throbs and pangs  Just long enough to claim my father's blessing  And sigh my last breath in my sister's arms  And here she kneels poor maid all dumb with grief  Restrain thy sorrow gentlest Evelina  True thou dost see me bleed I bleed to death  EVELINA  Say'st thou to death O gods the barbed shaft  Is buried in his breast Yes he must die  And I alas am doom'd to see him die  Where are your healing arts medicinal herbs  Ye holy men your wonderworking spells  Pluck me but out this shaft staunch but this blood  And I will call down blessings on your heads  With such a fervencyAnd can ye not  Then let me beg you on my bended knee  Give to my misery some opiate drug  May shut up all my sensesYes good fathers  Mingle the potion so that it may kill me  Just at the instant this poor languisher  Heaves his last sigh  ARVIRAGUS  Talk not thus wildly sister  Think on our father's age  EVELINA  Alas my brother  We have no father now or if we have  He is a captive  ARVIRAGUS  Captive O my wound  It stings me nowBut is it so    turning to the Chorus  CHORUS  Alas  We know no more save that he sallied single  To meet the foe whose unexpected host  Round by the east had wound their fraudful march  And fir'd our groves  ELIDURUS  O fatal fatal valour  Then is he seiz'd or slain  ARVIRAGUS  Too sure he is  Druid not half the Romans met our swords  We found the fraud too late the rest are yonder  CHORUS  How could they gain the pass  ARVIRAGUS  The wretch that fled  That way return'd conducting half their powers  AndBut thy pardon youth I will not wound thee  He is thy brother  ELIDURUS  Thus my honest sword  Shall force the blood from the detested heart  That holds alliance with him  ARVIRAGUS  Elidurus  Hold on our friendship hold Thou noble youth  Look on this innocent maid She must to Rome  Captive to Rome Thou seest warm life flow from me  Ere long she'll have no brother Heav'n's my witness  I do not wish that thou shouldst live the slave  Of Rome But yet she is my sister  ELIDURUS  Prince  Thou urgest that might make me drag an age  In fetters worse than Roman I will live  And while I live  Enter  BARD  Fly to your caverns Druids  The grove's beset around The chief approaches  CHORUS  Let him approach we will confront his pride  The chief that rules amid the groves of Mona  Has not to fear his fury What tho' age  Slackens our sinews what tho' shield and sword  Give not their iron aid to guard our body  Yet virtue arms our soul and 'gainst that panoply  What 'vails the rage of robbers Let him come  ARVIRAGUS  I faint apaceYe venerable men  If ye can save this body from pollution  If ye can tomb me in this sacred place  I trust ye will I fought to save these groves  And fruitless tho' I fought some grateful oak  I trust will spread its reverential gloom  O'er my pale ashesAh that pang was death  My sister Oh    dies  ELIDURUS  She faints Ah raise her  EVELINA  Yes  Now he is dead I felt his spirit go  In a cold sigh and as it past methought  It paus'd a while and trembled on my lips  Take me not from him Breathless as he is  He is my brother still and if the gods  Do please to grace him with some happier being  They ne'er can give to him a fonder sister  CHORUS  Brethren surround the corse and ere the foe  Approaches chaunt with meet solemnity  That grateful dirge your dying champion claims  SEMICHORUS  Lo where incumbent o'er the shade  Rome's ravening eagle bows her beaked head  Yet while a moment fate affords  While yet a moment freedom stays  That moment which outweighs  Eternity's unmeasur'd hoards  Shall Mona's grateful Bards employ  To hymn their godlike Hero to the sky  SEMICHORUS  Ring out ye mortal strings  Answer thou heav'nly harp instinct with spirit all  That o'er the jasper arch selfwarbling swings  Of blest Andraste's throne  Thy sacred sounds alone  Can celebrate the fall  Of bold Arviragus    Enter Aulus Didius and Romans  AULUS DIDIUS CHORUS EVELINA ELIDURUS  Ye bloody priests  Behold we burst on your infernal rites  And bid ye pause Instant restore our soldiers  Nor hope that superstition's ruthless step  Shall wade in Roman gore Ye savage men  Did not our laws give licence to all faiths  We would o'erturn your altars headlong heave  These shapeless symbols of your barbarous gods  And let the golden sun into your caves  CHORUS  Servant of Caesar has thine impious tongue  Spent the black venom of thy blasphemy  It has Then take our curses on thine head  Ev'n his fell curses who doth reign in Mona  Vicegerent of those gods thy pride insults  AULUS DIDIUS  Bold priest I scorn thy curses and thyself  Soldiers go search the caves and free the prisoners  Take heed you seize Caractacus alive  Arrest yon youth load him with heaviest irons  He shall to Caesar answer for his crime  ELIDURUS  I stand prepar'd to triumph in my crime  AULUS DIDIUS  'Tis well proud boy  Look to the beauteous maid    to the soldiers  That tranc'd in grief bends o'er yon bleeding corse  Respect her sorrows  EVELINA  Hence ye barbarous men  Ye shall not take him weltring thus in blood  To shew at Rome what British virtue was  Avaunt The breathless body that you touch  Was once Arviragus  AULUS DIDIUS  Fear us not princess  We reverence the dead  CHORUS  Would too to heav'n  Ye reverenc'd the gods but ev'n enough  Not to debase with slavery's cruel chain  What they created free  AULUS DIDIUS  The Romans fight  Not to enslave but humanize the world  CHORUS  Go too we will not parley with thee Roman  Instant pronounce our doom  AULUS DIDIUS  Hear it and thank us  This once our clemency shall spare your groves  If at our call ye yield the British king  Yet learn when next ye aid the foes of Caesar  That each old oak whose solemn gloom ye boast  Shall bow beneath our axes  CHORUS  Be they blasted  Whene'er their shade forgets to shelter virtue  Enter  BARD  Mourn Mona mourn Caractacus is captive  And dost thou smile false Roman do not think  He fell an easy prey Know ere he yielded  Thy bravest veterans bled He too thy spy  The base Brigantian prince hath seal'd his fraud  With death Bursting thro' armed ranks that hemm'd  The caitiff round the brave Caractacus  Seiz'd his false throat and as he gave him death  Indignant thunder'd 'Thus is my last stroke  'The stroke of justice' Numbers then opprest him  I saw the slave that cowardly behind  Pinion'd his arms I saw the sacred sword  Writh'd from his grasp I saw what now ye see  Inglorious sight those barbarous bonds upon him  CARACTACUS AULUS DIDIUS CHORUS c  Romans methink the malice of your tyrant  Might furnish heavier chains Old as I am  And wither'd as ye see these warworn limbs  Trust me they shall support the weightiest load  Injustice dares impose  Proudcrested soldier    to Didius  Who seemst the mastermover in this business  Say dost thou read less terror on my brow  Than when thou met'st me in the fields of war  Heading my nations No my freeborn soul  Has scorn still left to sparkle thro' these eyes  And frown defiance on thee  Is it thus    seeing his Son's body  Then I'm indeed a captive Mighty gods  My soul my soul submits Patient it bears  The pondrous load of grief ye heap upon it  Yes it will grovel in this shatter'd breast  And be the sad tame thing it ought to be  Coopt in a servile body  AULUS DIDIUS  Droop not king  When Claudius the great master of the world  Shall hear the noble story of thy valour  His pity  CARACTACUS  Can a Roman pity soldier  And if he can gods must a Briton bear it  Arviragus my bold my breathless boy  Thou hast escap'd such pity thou art free  Here in high Mona shall thy noble limbs  Rest in a noble grave posterity  Shall to thy tomb with annual reverence bring  Sepulchral stones and pile them to the clouds  Whilst mine  AULUS DIDIUS  The morn doth hasten our departure  Prepare thee king to go A fav'ring gale  Now swells our sails  CARACTACUS  Inhuman that thou art  Dost thou deny a moment for a father  To shed a few warm tears o'er his dead son  I tell thee chief this act might claim a life  To do it duly even a longer life  Than sorrow ever suffer'd Cruel man  And thou deniest me moments Be it so  I know you Romans weep not for your children  You triumph o'er your tears and think it valour  I triumph in my tears Yes bestlov'd boy  Yes I can weep can fall upon thy corse  And I can tear my hairs these few grey hairs  The only honours war and age have left me  Ah son thou mightst have rul'd o'er many nations  As did thy royal ancestry But I  Rash that I was ne'er knew the golden curb  Discretion hangs on brav'ry Else perchance  These men that fasten fetters on thy father  Had sued to him for peace and claim'd his friendship  AULUS DIDIUS  But thou wast still implacable to Rome  And scorn'd her friendship  CARACTACUS  starting up from the body  Soldier I had arms  Had neighing steeds to whirl my iron cars  Had wealth dominion Dost thou wonder Roman  I fought to save them What if Caesar aims  To lord it universal o'er the world  Shall the world tamely crouch at Caesar's footstool  AULUS DIDIUS  Read in thy fate our answer Yet if sooner  Thy pride had yielded  CARACTACUS  Thank thy gods I did not  Had it been so the glory of thy master  Like my misfortunes had been short and trivial  Oblivion's ready prey Now after struggling  Nine years and that right bravely 'gainst a tyrant  I am his slave to treat as seems him good  If cruelly 'twill be an easy task  To bow a wretch alas how bow'd already  Down to the dust If well his clemency  When trick'd and varnish'd by your glossing penmen  Will shine in honour's annals and adorn  Himself it boots not me Look there look there  The slave that shot that dart left not a hope  For lost Caractacus Arise my daughter  Alas poor prince art thou too in vile fetters    to Elidurus  Come hither youth Be thou to me a son  To her a brother Thus with trembling arms  I lead ye forth children we go to Rome  Weepst thou my girl I prithee hoard thy tears  For the sad meeting of thy captive mother  For we have much to tell her much to say  Of these good men who nurtur'd us in Mona  Much of the fraud and malice that pursued us  Much of her son who pour'd his precious blood  To save his sire and sister Thinkst thou maid  Her gentleness can hear the tale and live  And yet she must O gods I grow a talker  Grief and old age are ever full of words  But I'll be mute Adieu ye holy men  Yet one look moreNow lead us hence for ever  THE END  ILLUSTRATIONS  THE few following quotations from ancient authors are here thrown together in order to support and explain some passages in the Drama that respect the manners of the Druids and which the general account of their customs to be found in our histories of Britain does not include  Page ℣  On the left  Beside the *sages skill'd in nature's lore  *  ie  The Euvates one of the three classes of the Druids according to Am Marcellinus Studia liberalium doctrinarum inchoata per Bardos Euvates Druidas This class Strabo tells us had the care of the sacrifices and studied natural philosophy which here by  the changeful universe  is shewn to be on Pythagorean principles Whenever the  Priests  are mentioned in the subsequent parts of the Drama this order of men is intended to be meant as distinguished from the Druids and Bards  Page ℣  Thou shalt live  Yet shalt thou live an interdicted wretch  All rights of nature cancell'd  Alluding to the Druidical power of excommunication mentioned by Caesar Si quis aut privatus aut publicus eorum decreto non stetit sacrificiis interdicunt Haec poena apud eos est gravissirra  Quibus ita est interdictum ii numero impiorum ac sceleratorum habenturneque iis petentibus jus redditur neque honos ullus communicatur C Comment Lib vi  P ℣  Are the milkwhite steers prepar'd  In the minute description which Pliny gives us of the ceremony of gathering the misletoe he tells us they sacrificed two white bulls See Pliny's Natural History L c which Drayton in his Polyolbion thus versifies  Sometimes within my shades in many an ancient wood  Whose oftentwined tops great Phoebus' fires withstood  The fearless British priests under an aged oak  Taking a milkwhite bull unstrained with the yoke  And with an ax of gold from that Jovesacred tree  The misletoe cut down then with a bended knee  On th' unhew'd altar laid put to the hallow'd fires  And whilst in the sharp flame the trembling flesh expires  As their strong fury mov'd when all the rest adore  Pronouncing their desires the sacrifice before  Up to th' eternal heav'n their bloodied hands did rear  And whilst the murm'ring woods ev'n shudder'd as with fear  Preach'd to the beardless youth the soul's immortal state  To other bodies still how it should transmigrate  That to contempt of death them strongly did excite  Ninth Song  Page ℣  Where our matron sister dwells  The existence of female Druids seems ascertained by Taeitus in his description of the final destruction of Mona by Paulinus Suetonius Stabat pro litore diversa acies densa armis virisque  intercursantibus  faeminis  c Also by the known story of Dioclesian on which Fletcher formed a play called the Prophetess  Page ℣  And the potent adderstone  The ovum anguinum or serpent's egg a famous Druidical amulet thus circumstantially described by PlinyPraeterea est ovorum genus in magna Galliarum fama omissum Graecis Angues innumeri aestate convoluti salivis faucium corporumque spumis artifici complexu glomerantur anguinum appellatur Druidae sibilis id dicunt in sublime jactari sagoque oportere intercipi ne tellurem attingat Profugere raptorem equo serpentes enim insequi donec arceantur amnis alicujus interventu c Nat Hist Lib xxix c  There are remains of this superstition still both in the north and west parts of our island For Lhwyd the author of the Archeologia writes thus to Rowland see Mona Antiqua p  "The Druid doctrine about the  Glain Neidr  obtains very much thro' all Scotland as well lowlands as highlands but there is not a word of it in this kingdom Ireland where as there are no snakes they could not propagate it Besides snakestones the highlanders have their snailstones paddockstones c to all which they attribute their several virtues and wear them as amulets"  And in another letter he writes  "The Cornish retain variety of charms and have still towards the land'send the amulet of Maen Magal and Glain Neidr which latter they call a Milpreu or Melpreu and have a charm for the snake to make it when they have found one asleep and struck a hazel wand in the centre of her spires"  Page ℣  Have the milk white steeds  Unrein'd and neighing pranc'd with fav'ring steps  The few and imperfect accounts antiquity gives us of ceremonies c which are unquestionably Druidical makes it necessary in this and in other places of the Drama to have recourse to Tacitus's account of the Germans amongst whom if there were really no established Druids there was certainly a great correspondency in religious opinions with the Gauls and Britons The passage here alluded to is taken from his th chapter Proprium gentis equorumque quoque praesagia ac monitus experiri Publice aluntur iisdem nemoribus ac lucis candidi nullo mortali opere contacti quos pressos sacro curru sacerdos ac rex vel princeps

adamant  This is meant to describe the rockingstone of which there are several still to be seen in Wales Cornwall and Derbyshire They are universally thought by antiquarians to be Druid monuments and Mr Toland thinks  "that the Druids made the people believe that they only could move them and that by a miracle by which they condemned or acquitted the accused and often brought criminals to confess what could in no other way be extorted from them"  'Twas this conjecture which gave the hint for this piece of machinery The reader may find a description of one of these rockingstones in Camden's Britannia in his account of Pembrokeshire and also several in Borlase's history of Cornwall  Page ℣  And its name  TRIFINGUS  The name of the inchanted sword in the Hervarer Saga  Page ℣  By the

Roman as  mistaking the rude stones placed round the grove for idols Thus Lucan in his beautiful description of a Druid grove  simulacraque moesta deorum  Arte carent caesisque extant informia truncis
