without  TempleBar  MDCCXVII  Price    d  AN EPISTLE TO THE King of Sweden FROM A LADY of  GREATBRITAIN    TO  Thee  rude Warrior whom we once admir'd  And thought thy Actions spoke  Thee  half inspir'd  While Justice held the Ballance of thy Cause  And ev'ry Language sounded thy Applause  But since Ambition and Revenge prevails  Thy Glories languish and our Wonder fails  To  Thee  a Woman sends with Gen'rous Care  And Warns thy Rashness timely to beware  FAME now a Tale of fresher Date has told  Beyond thy mad Romantick Feats of Old  Our Malecontents thy numerous Squadrons boast  Describe thy Penants waving on our Coast  And to the Fearful cry  Britannia  's lost  But we who know the Genius of our Isle  At their Report and thy Invasion smile  ARE not our Dames in every Climate fam'd  Les Belles Angloises  by ev'ry Nation nam'd  Are not our Youth in foreign Fields admir'd▪  Alike by Valour and by Love inspir'd▪  And shall those Fair ones who the Morning pass  Consulting that dear Friend to Love the Glass  To set the Favourite and the Patch to place  To bow and glance it with becoming Grace  To melt the Hero's Heart and charm his Eyes  Fall to thy  Gothick  Rage a Sacrifice  No to thy Terror learn our  British  Youth  Are fam'd for Honour Constancy and Truth  Each wou'd as soon consent thy Cause to aid  As yield the Fair to whom his Vows are paid  Unlike the Passive Females of thy Land  The Arbitrators of the  War  we stand  At  Flurt  of  Fan  our armed Legions fly  And they who dare offend must dare to die  We know thy daring Heart is nurs'd in Blood  Wild as the fiercest Savage of the Wood  With Fame like this in Northern Slaughter shine  ough as the frozen Bear thy neighb'ring Sign  But here thy brutal Force no Growns shall gain  By Love as well as Arms our Monarchs Reign  Can we our  GEORGE  and His lov'd RACE disown  To find thy barren Chastity a Throne  No in thy  shaggy Rugg  rude Slumbers take  And dream of Conquests thou shalt never make  At distance be thy Leathern Doublet worn  Nor risque thy Life to purchase certain Scorn  For now the  Wormwood Dam'sels  apprehend  The dismal Consequence of such a Friend  Begin to tremble at the Truths they hear  And vow their Champions shall for  GEORGE  declare  They fear thy Tast shou'd lead young  James  astray  And quite unman their Monarch ev'ry way  In his Excuse they still would have to tell  Tho' War's his Foe He loves exceeding well  The Proof from whence he sprung is'not to Fight  His  Surgeon  proves  Hereditary  Right  BUT if by thy Example he should grow  Cold as thy Rocks of Ice and Hills of Snow  Shou'd he clean Linnen hold in dire Disgrace  And  sable Crape  his Ivory Neck enchase  Shou'd he like thee on Shives of coarsest Bread  Rudely with dirty Thumbs his Butter spread  Banish the generous Juice of Grapes away  And with small acid Tiff his Thirst allay  Swallow lean hasty Meals of Tastless Roots  And Eat and Drink and Live and Reign in Boots  Shou'd he like thee regardless of the Fair  Lye down to Sleep and only wake to War  Cou'd He in Arms like Gallant  Brunswick  Shine  Yet wou'd His Female Friends His Cause decline  Nor justifie a Right so slovenly Divine  CONSULT thy Safety send no Armies forth  Beyond the Confines of thy frozen North  Since of our  British  Fair this Truth is told  We love the Chaste but we abhor the Cold  But if thy daring Folly will proceed  Fate drives thee forward and thy Fall's decreed  EACH lovely Toast her Hero's Soul inspires  Urges the War and wakes his Martial Fires  Think but what Terrors will thy Spirits seize  When thou shalt face such Enemies as these  See a Battalion lac'd with Point  d'Espan    And warm in glowing Velvets leads the Van  With Warlike Air th' embroider'd Chiefs appear  And gracefully the Looms rich Labours wear  In Modish Order o'er their Sholders fly  Deville  's Wiggs or  Lockman  's smarter Tye  The GoldClock'd Stocking draws the Gazer's Sight  And  Verdin  's Redtop'd Shoe stitch'd round with White  Fine  Meclin  Laces round their Fingers play  From Snowy Shirts at least chang'd twice a Day  THESE welldress'd Youths to thy Destruction move  And Vict'ry waits upon the Wings of Love  Our Sexes Softness is to thee unknown  What by a Look or one kind Kiss is done  Thou who a Stranger art to Love's Delight  Can'st ne'er imagine how these Lovers Fight  These are the  Men  who on the  Flandrian  Plains  O'erthrew the  Grand Monarch  in Ten Campaigns  Will these give way before  Thy Vandal  Host  And yield their former Labours all for lost  No these for Liberty and Beauty draw  And all around the Neighb'ring Tyrants awe  These Cock take Snuff invoke the darling Fair  And then dispatch the Foe  endebonair    AIM then no more fond Prince at  George's  Throne  Wake from the flatt'ring Dream and guard thy own  In ev'ry Element alike we Reign  And launch our ready Squadrons on the Main  Our Champions jocund o'er the flowing Bowl  Reigns in their Wooden Worlds from Pole to Pole  Fearless of Danger cut their conqu'ring Way  And from invading Tyrants scour the Sea  Safer thou might'st in Lakes of Sulphur sleep  Than brave these dreadful Masters of the Deep  Beneath their Cannons roar thy Flaggs must fall  ORFORD  presides and these are  Brittons  all  These bold as Lyons will the Fight maintain  Or drive thee back or sink thee in the Main  Tho' Boisterous as the Winds at Sea they roar  They're gentle all as Southern Gales on Shore  Th' Engagement past the tender Thoughts return  And for the Fair in Love's foft Fires they burn  In Beauty's dear Embraces lull'd they lie  But when their  Country  calls Her strongest Foes defie  THESE hoist their Sails and wait thy Coming o'er  And if thou dar'st to touch  Britannia  's Shore  Ne'er hope to see thy Native  Sweden  more  How wilt thou dare these Hearts of Oak to meet  Shou'd Young  Augustus  deign to lead the Fleet  Augustus He  who striding o'er the Slain  Hunted thy  New Ally  o'er  Flandria  's Plain  The  Boy  whose  Cause  forsaken now by all  Calls for a Madman to prevent his Fall  No  Dastard Blood  our Princes Veins disgrace  Unlike the  Princes  of a  Former  Race  Who wisely  Slept  or  Blubber'd  in Distress  He'll Face the Battel and will force Success  FROM Great  Plantagenet Augustus  springs  By  His  Example taught to Conquer Kings  Methinks I see the  Royal Warriour  stand  Dealing amongst his  Chiefs  thy Forfeit Land  While  Thou  shalt fall Unpity'd and Forlorn  All  Europe  's Terror once but now all  Europe  's Scorn  FINIS
