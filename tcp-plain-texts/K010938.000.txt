female spirit brav'd  That tyrant stabb'd and by her nerveless arm  While Virtue's spell surrounding guards could charm  Can she this sacred tumult in her breast  Turn Father Freedom Virtue all to jest  Wake you ye fair ones from your sweet repose  As wanton zephyrs wake the sleeping rose  Dispel those clouds which o'er your eyelids crept  Which our wise Bard mistook and swore you wept  Shall she to MACARONIES life restore  Who yawn'd half dead and curs'd the tragic BORE  Dismiss 'em smirking to their nightly haunt  Where dice and cards their moonstruck minds enchant  Some muffled like the witches in Macbeth  Brood o'er the magic circle pale as death  Others  the cauldron go aboutabout  And Ruin enters as the Fates run out  Bubble bubble  Toil and trouble  Passions burn  And bets are double  Double double  Toil and trouble  Passions burn  And all is bubble  But jests apart for scandal forms these tales  Falsehood be mutelet Justice hold her scales  Britons were ne'er enslav'd by evil powr's  To peace and wedded love they give their midnight hours  From slumbers pure no rattling dice can wake 'em  Who  make  the laws were never known to  break  'em  'Tis false ye fair whatever spleen may say  That you down Folly's tide are borne away  You never wish at deep distress to sneer  For eyes tho' bright are brighter thro' a tear  Should it e'er be this Nation's wretched fate  To laugh at all that's good and wise and great  Arm'd at all points let Genius take the field  And on the stage afflicted Virtue shield  Drive from the land each base unworthy passion  Till Virtue

YET yet a moment hear Philotas hear me  Philo  No more it must not be  Melan  Obdurate man  Thus wilt thou spurn me when a king distress'd  A good a virtuous venerable king  The father of his people from a throne  Which long with ev'ry virtue he adorn'd  Torn by a ruffian by a tyrant's hand  Groans in captivity In his own palace  Lives a sequester'd prisonerOh Philotas  If thou ha'st not renounc'd humanity  Let me behold my sov'reign once again  Admit me to his presence let me see  My royal master  Philo  Urge thy suit no further  Thy words are fruitless Dionysius' orders  Forbid access he is our sov'reign now  'Tis his to give the law mine to obey  Melan  Thou can'st not mean ithis to give the law  Detested spoilerhisa vile usurper  Have we forgot the elder Dionysius  Surnam'd the Tyrant To Sicilia's throne  The monster waded thro' whole seas of blood  Sore groan'd the land beneath his iron rod  Till rous'd at length Evander came from Greece  Like Freedom's Genius came and sent the tyrant  Stript of the crown and to his humble rank  Once more reduc'd to roam for vile subsistence  A wandering sophist thro' the realms of Greece  Philo  Melanthon yes full clearly I remember  The splendid day when all rejoicing Sicily  Hail'd her deliverer  Melan  Shall the tyrant's son  Deduce a title from the father's guilt  Philotas thou wert once the friend of goodness  Thou art a Greek fair Corinth gave thee birth  I mark'd thy growing youth I need not tell  With what an equal sway Evander reign'd  How just how upright generous and good  From ev'ry region bards and sages came  Whate'er of science ancient Egypt stor'd  All that the East had treasur'd all that Greece  Of moral wisdom taught and Plato's voice  Was heard in Sicily Shall Dionysius  Extinguish ev'ry virtue in the land  Bow to his yoke the necks of freeborn men  And here perpetuate a tyrant's reign  Philo  Whate'er his right to him in Syracuse  All bend the knee his the supreme dominion  And death and torment wait his sovreign nod  Mel  But soon that Pow'r shall cease behold his walls  Now close encircled by the Grecian bands  Timoleon leads them on indignant Corinth  Sends her avenger forth array'd in terror  To hurl ambition from a throne usurp'd  And bid all Sicily resume her rights  Philo  Thou wert a statesman once Melanthon now  Grown dim with age thy eye pervades no more  The deeplaid schemes which Dionysius plans  Know then a fleet from Carthage even now  Stems the rough billow and e'er yonder sun  That now declining seeks the Western wave  Shall to the shades of night resign the world  Thou'lt see the Punic sails in yonder bay  Whose waters wash the walls of Syracuse  Melan  Art thou a stranger to Timoleon's name  Intent to plan and circumspect to see  All possible events he rushes on  Resistless in his course Your boasted master  Scarce stands at bay each hour the strong blockade  Hems him in closer and e'er long thou'lt view  Oppression's iron rod to fragments shiver'd  The good Evander then  Philo  Alas Evander  Will ne'er behold the golden time you look for  Melan  How not behold it Say Philotas speak  Has the fell tyrant have his felon murderers  Philo  As yet my friend Evander lives  Melan  And yet  Thy dark halfhinted purposeLead me to him  If thou hast murder'd him  Philo  By Heav'n he lives  Melan  Then bless me with one tender interview  Thrice has the sun gone down since last these eyes  Have seen the good old king say why is this  Wherefore debarr'd his presence Thee Philotas  The troops obey that guard the royal pris'ner  Each avenue to thee is open thou  Can'st grant admittance let me let me see him  Philo  Entreat no more the soul of Dionysius  Is ever wakeful rent with all the pangs  That wait on conscious guilt  Melan  But when dun night  Philo  Alas it cannot beBut mark my words  Let Greece urge on her general assault  Dispatch some friend who may o'erleap the walls  And tell Timoleon the good old Evander  Has liv'd three days by Dionysius' order  Lock'd up from ev'ry sustenance of nature  And life now wearied out almost expires  Melan  If any spark of virtue dwell within thee  Lead me Philotas lead me to his prison  Philo  The tyrant's jealous care hath mov'd him thence  Melan  Ha mov'd him say'st thou  Philo  At the midnight hour  Silent convey'd him up the steep ascent  To where the elder Dionysius form'd  On the sharp summit of the pointed rock  Which overhangs the deep a dungeon drear  Cell within cell a labyrinth of horror  Deep cavern'd in the cliff where many a wretch  Unseen by mortal eye has groan'd in anguish  And died obscure unpitied and unknown  Melan  Clandestine murderer Yes there's the scene  Of horrid massacre Full oft I've walk'd  When all things lay in sleep and darkness hush'd  Yes oft I've walk'd the lonely sullen beach  And heard the mournful sound of many a corse  Plung'd from the rock into the wave beneath  That murmur'd on the shore And means he thus  To end a monarch's life Oh grant my pray'r  My timely succour may protract his days  The guard is yours  Philo  Forbear thou plead'st in vain  I must not yield it were assur'd destruction  Farewell dispatch a message to the Greeks  I'll to my station now thou know'st the worst  Exit  MELANTHON  Oh lost Evander Lost Euphrasia too  How will her gentle nature bear the shock  Of a dear father thus in lingring pangs  A prey to famine like the veriest wretch  Whom the hard hand of misery hath grip'd  In vain she'll rave with impotence of sorrow  Perhaps provoke her fateGreece arms in vain  All's lost Evander dies  Enter  CALLIPPUS  Calip  Where is the king  Our troops that sallied to attack the foe  Retire disordered to the eastern gate  The Greeks pursue Timoleon rides in blood  Arm arm and meet their fury  Melan  To the citadel  Direct thy footsteps Dionysius there  Marshalls a chosen band  Calip  Do thou call forth  Thy hardy Vetrans haste or all is lost  Exit  Warlike mus  c  MELANTHON  Now ye just Gods now look propitious down  Now give the Grecian sabre tenfold edge  And save a virtuous king  Warlike musick  Enter  EUPHRASIA  Euphra  War on ye heroes  Ye great asserters of a monarch's cause  Let the wild tempest rise Melanthon ha  Did'st thou not hear the vast tremendous roar  Down tumbling from it's base the eastern tow'r  Burst on the tyrant's ranks and on the plain  Lies an extended ruin  Melan  Still new horrors  Increase each hour and gather round our heads  Euphra  The glorious tumult lists my tow'ring soul  Once more Melanthon once again my father  Shall mount Sicilia's throne  Melan  Alas that hour  Would come with joy to ev'ry honest heart  Would shed divinest blessings from it's wing  But no such hour in all the round of time  I fear the fates averse will e'er lead on  Euphra  And still Melanthon still does pale despair  Depress thy spirit Lo Timoleon comes  Arm'd with the pow'r of Greece the brave the just  Godlike Timoleon ardent to redress  He guides the war and gains upon his prey  A little interval shall set the victor  Within our gates triumphant  Melan  Still my fears  Forebode for thee Would thou had'st left this place  When hence your husband the brave Phocion fled  Fled with your infant son  Euphra  In duty fix'd  Here I remain'd while my brave gen'rous Phocion  Fled with my child and from his mother's arms  Bore my sweet little oneFull well thou know'st  The pangs I suffer'd in that trying moment  Did I not weep Did I not rave and shriek  And by the roots tear my dishevell'd hair  Did I not follow to the seabeat shore  Resolv'd with him and with my blooming boy  To trust the winds and waves  Melan  Deem not Euphrasia  I e'er can doubt thy constancy and love  Euphra  Melanthon how I loved the Gods who saw  Each secret image that my fancy form'd  The Gods can witness how I lov'd my Phocion  And yet I went not with him Could I do it  Could I desert my father Could I leave  The venerable man who gave me being  A victim here in Syracuse nor stay  To watch his fate to visit his affliction  To cheer his prisonhours and with the tear  Of filial virtue bid ev'n bondage smile  Melan  The pious act whate'er the fates intend  Shall merit heartfelt praise  Euphra  Yes Phocion go  Go with my child torn from this matron breast  This breast that still should yield it's nurture to him  Fly with my infant to some happier shore  If he be safe Euphrasia dies content  Till that sad close of all the task be mine  To tend a father with delighted care  To smooth the pillow of declining age  See him sink gradual into mere decay  On the last verge of life watch ev'ry look  Explore each fond unutterable wish  Catch his last breath and close his eyes in peace  Melan  I would not add to thy afflictions yet  My heart misgivesEvander's fatal period  Euphra  Still is far off the Gods have sent relief  And once again I shall behold him king  Mel  Alas this dream of hope at length may waken  To deep despair  Euphra  The spiritstirring virtue  That glows within me ne'er shall know despair  No I will trust the Gods Desponding man  Hast thou not heard with what resistless ardour  Timoleon drives the tumult of the war  Hast thou not heard him thund'ring at our gates  The tyrant's pent up in his last retreat  Anon thou'lt see his battlements in dust  His walls his ramparts and his tow'rs in ruin  Destruction pouring in on ev'ry side  Pride and oppression at their utmost need  And nought to save him in his hopeless hour  A flourish of trumpets  Melan  Ha the fell tyrant comesBeguile his rage  And o'er your sorrows cast a dawn of gladness  Enter  DIONYSIUS CALIPPUS OFFICERS c  Di  The vain presumptuous Greek His hopes of conquest  Like a gay dream are vanish'd into air  Proudly elate and flush'd with easy triumph  O'er vulgar warriors to the gates of Syracuse  He urg'd the war till Dionysius' arm  Let slaughter loose and taught his dastard train  To seek their safety by inglorious flight  Euphra  O Dionysius if distracting fears  Alarm this throbbing bosom you will pardon  A frail and tender sex Should ruthless war  Roam through our streets and riot here in blood  Where shall the lost Euphrasia find a shelter  In vain she'll kneel and clasp the sacred altar  O let me then in mercy let me seek  The gloomy mansion where my father dwells  I die content if in his arms I perish  Dion  Thou lovely trembler hush thy fears to rest  The Greek recoils like the impetuous surge  That dashes on the rock there breaks and foams  And backward rolls into the sea again  All shall be well in Syracuse a fleet  Appears in view and brings the chosen sons  Of Carthage From the hill that fronts the harbour  I saw their canvas swelling with the wind  While on the purple wave the western sun  Glanc'd the remains of day  Euphra  Yet till the fury  Of war subside the wild the horrid interval  In safety let me soothe to dear delight  In a lov'd father's presence from his sight  For three long days with specious feign'd excuse  Your guards debarr'd me Oh while yet he lives  Indulge a daughter's love worn out with age  Soon must he seal his eyes in endless night  And with his converse charm my ear no more  Dion  Why thus anticipate misfortune Still  Evander mocks the injuries of time  Calippus thou survey the city round  Station the centiness that no surprise  Invade the unguarded works while drouzy night  Weighs down the soldier's eye Afflicted fair  Thy couch invites thee When the tumult's o'er  Thou'lt see Evander with redoubled joy  Though now unequal to the cares of empire  His age sequester him yet honours high  Shall gild the ev'ning of his various day  Euphra  For this benignity accept my thanks  They gush in tears and my heart pours it's tribute  Dion  Perdiccas e'er the morn's revolving light  Unveil the face of things do thou dispatch  A welloar'd galley to Hamilcar's fleet  At the north point of yonder promontory  Let some selected officer instruct him  To moor his ships and issue on the land  Then may Timoleon tremble vengeance then  Shall overwhelm his camp pursue his bands  With fatal havoc to the ocean's margin  And cast their limbs to glut the vulture's famine  In mangled heaps upon the naked shore  Exit Dionysius  EUPHRASIA MILANTHON  Euphra  What do I hear Melanthon can it be  If Carthage comes if her perfidious sons  List in his cause the dawn of freedom's gone  Mel  Woe bitt'rest woe impends thou would'st not think  Euphra  Howspeakunfold  Melan  My tongue denies it's office  Euphra  How is my father Say Melanthon  Melan  He  Perhaps he dies this momentSince Timoleon  First form'd his lines round this beleaguer'd city  No nutriment has touched Evander's lips  In the deep caverns of the rock imprison'd  He pines in bitt'rest want  Euphra  To that abode  Of woe and horror that last stage of life  Has the fell tyrant mov'd him  Melan  There sequester'd  Alas he soon must perish  Euphra  Well my heart Well do your vital drops forget to flow  Melan  Enough his sword has reek'd with public slaughter  Now dark insiduous deeds must thin mankind  Euphra  Oh night that oft hast heard my piercing shrieks  Disturb thy awful silence oft has heard  Each stroke these hands in frantic sorrow gave  From this sad breast resounding now no more  I mean to vent complaints I mean not now  With busy mem'ry to retrace the wrongs  His hand hath heap'd on our devoted race  I bear it all with calmest patience bear it  Resign'd and wretched desperate and lost  Melan  Despair alas is all the sad resource Our fate allows us now  Euphra  Yet why despair  Is that the tribute to a father due  Blood is his due Melanthon yes the blood  The vile black blood that fills the tyrant's veins  Would graceful look upon my dagger's point  Come vengeance come shake off this feeble sex  Sinew my arm and guide it to his heart  And thou O filial piety that rul'st  My woman's breast turn to vindictive rage  Assume the port of justice shew mankind  Tyrannic guilt hath never dar'd in Syracuse  Beyond the reach of virtue  Melan  Yet beware  Controul this frenzy that bears down your reason  Surrounded by his guards the tyrant mocks  Your utmost fury moderate your zeal  Nor let him hear these transports of the soul  These wild upbraidings  Euphra  Shall Euphrasia's voice  Be hush'd to silence when a father dies  Shall not the monster hear his deeds accurst  Shall he not tremble when a daughter comes  Wild with her griefs and terrible with wrongs  Fierce in despair all nature in her cause  Alarm'd and rouz'd to vengeanceYes Melanthon  The man of blood shall hear me yes my voice  Shall mount aloft upon the whirlwind's wing  Pierce yon blue vault and bring the thund'rer down  Melanthon come my wrongs will lend me force  The weakness of my sex is gone this arm  Feels tenfold strength this arm shall do a deed  For Heav'n and earth for men and gods to wonder at  This arm shall vindicate a father's cause  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  A wild romantic Scene amidst overhanging Rocks a Cavern on one Side  ARCAS  with a Spear in his Hand  THE gloom of night sits heavy on the world  And o'er the solemn scene such stillness reigns  As 'twere a pause of nature on the beach  No murmuring billow breaks the Grecian tents  Lie sunk in sleep no gleaming fires are seen  All Syracuse is hush'd no stir abroad  Save ever and anon the dashing oar  That beats the sullen wave And harkWas that  The groan of anguish from Evander's cell  Piercing the midnight gloomIt is the sound  Of bustling prows that cleave the briny deep  Perhaps at this dead hour Hamilcar's fleet  Rides in the bay  Enter  PHILOTAS  from the Cavern  Philo  What hobrave Arcasho  Arcas  Why thus desert thy couch  Philo  Methought the sound Of distant uproar chas'd affrighted sleep  Arcas  At intervals the oar's resounding stroke  Comes ecchoing from the main Save that report  A deathlike silence thro' the wide expanse  Broods o'er the dreary coast  Philo  Do thou retire  And seek repose the duty of thy watch  Is now perform'd I take thy post  Arcas  How fares  Your royal pris'ner  Philo  Arcas shall I own  A secret weaknessMy heart inward melts  To see that suff'ring virtue On the earth  The cold dank earth the royal victim lies  And while pale famine drinks his vital spirit  He welcomes death and smiles himself to rest  Oh would I could relieve him Thou withdraw  Thy wearied nature claims repose and now  The watch is mine  Arcas  May no alarm disturb thee  Exit  PHILOTAS  Some dread event is lab'ring into birth  At close of day the sullen sky held forth  Unerring signalsWith disastrous glare  The moon's full orb rose crimson'd o'er with blood  And lo athwart the gloom a falling star  Trails a long tract of fireWhat daring step  Sounds on the flinty rock Stand there what ho  Speak ere thou dar'st advance  Enter  EUPHRASIA  with a Lanthorn in her Hand  Euphra  Thou need'st not fear  It is a friend approaches  Philo  Ha what mean  Those plaintive notes  Euphra  Here is no ambush'd Greek  No warrior to surprize thee on the watch  An humble suppliant comesAlas my strength  Exhausted quite forsakes this weary frame  Philo  What voice thus piercing thro' the gloom of night  What art thouSpeak unfold thy purpose say  What wretch with what intent at this dead hour  Wherefore alarm'st thou thus our peaceful watch  Euphra  Let no mistrust affright theeLo a wretch  The veriest wretch that ever groan'd in anguish  Comes here to grovel on the earth before thee  To tell her sad sad tale implore thy aid  For sure the pow'r is thine thou canst relieve  My bleeding heart and soften all my woes  Philo  Ha sure those accents  takes the light from her  Euphra  Deign to listen to me  Philo  Euphrasia  Euphra  Yes the lost undone Euphrasia  Supreme in wretchedness to th' inmost sense  Here in the quickest fibre of the heart  Wounded transfix'd and tortur'd to distraction  Philo  Why princess thus anticipate the dawn  Still sleep and silence wrap the weary world  The stars in mid career usurp the pole  The Grecian bands the winds the waves are hush'd  All things are mute around us all but you  Rest in oblivious slumber from their cares  Euphra  Yes all at peace I only wake to misery  Philo  How didst thou gain the summit of the rock  Euphra  Give me my father here you hold him fetter'd  Oh give him to mein the fond pursuit  All pain and peril vanish love and duty  Inspir'd the thought despair itself gave courage  I climb'd the hard ascent with painful toil  Surmounted craggy cliffs and pointed rocks  What will not misery attemptIf ever  The touch of nature throbb'd within your breast  Admit me to Evander in these caves  I know he pines in want let me convey  Some charitable succour to a father  Philo  Alas Euphrasia would I dar'd comply  Euphra  It will be virtue in thee thou like me  Wert born in GreeceOh by our common parent  Nay stay thou shalt not fly Philotas stay  You have a father toothink were his lot  Hard as Evander's if by felon hands  Chain'd to the earth with slow consuming pangs  He felt sharp want and with an asking eye  Implor'd relief yet cruel men denied it  Would'st thou not burst thro' adamantine gates  Thro' walls and rocks to save him Think Philotas  Of thy own aged sire and pity mine  Think of the agonies a daughter feels  When thus a parent wants the common food  The bounteous hand of nature meant for all  Philo  'Twere best withdraw thee princess thy assistance  Evander wants not it is fruitless all  Thy tears thy wild entreaties are in vain  Euphra  Hathou hast murder'd him he is no more  I understand theebutchers you have shed  The precious drops of life yet e'en in death  Let me behold him let a daughter close  With duteous hand a father's beamless eyes  Print her last kisses on his honour'd hand  And lay him decent in the shroud of death  Philo  Alas this frantic grief can nought avail  Retire and seek the couch of balmy sleep  In this dead hour this season of repose  Euphra  And dost thou then inhuman that thou art  Advise a wretch like me to know repose  This is my last abode these caves these rocks  Shall ring for ever with Euphrasia's wrongs  All Sicily shall hear me yonder deep  Shall echo back an injur'd daughter's cause  Here will I dwell and rave and shriek and give  These scatter'd locks to all the passing winds  Call on Evander lost and pouring curses  And cruel gods and cruel stars invoking  Stand on the cliff in madness and despair  Philo  Yet calm this violence reflect Euphrasia  With what severe enforcement Dionysius  Exacts obedience to his dread command  If here thou'rt found  Euphra  Here is Euphrasia's mansion  falls on the ground  Her fix'd eternal homeinhuman savages  Here stretch me with a father's murder'd corse  Then heap your rocks your mountains on my head  It will be kindness in you I shall rest  In tomb'd within a parent's arms  Philo  By Heav'n  My heart in pity bleeds  Euphra  Talk'st thou of pity  Yield to the gen'rous instinct grant my pray'r  Let my eyes view him gaze their last upon him  And shew you have some sense of human woe  Philo  Her vehemence of grief o'erpow'rs me quite  My honest heart condemns the barb'rous deed  And if I dare  Euphra  And if you dareIs that  The voice of manhood Honest if you dare  'Tis the slave's virtue 'tis the utmost limit  Of the base coward's honourNot a wretch  There's not a villain not a tool of pow'r  But silence interest extinguish fear  And he will prove benevolent to man  The gen'rous heart does more will dare do all  That honour promptsHow dost thou dare to murder  Respect the gods and know no other fear  Philo  Oh thou hast conquer'dYes Euphrasia go Behold thy father  Euphra  Raise me raise me up  I'll bathe thy hand with tears thou gen'rous man  Philo  Yet mark my words if aught of nourishment  Thou would'st convey my partners of the watch  Will ne'er consent  Euphra  I will observe your orders  On any terms oh let me let me see him  Philo  Yon lamp will guide thee thro' the cavern'd way  Euphra  My heart runs o'er in thanks the pious act  Timoleon shall reward the bounteous gods  And thy own virtue shall reward the deed  Goes into the cave  PHILOTAS  Prevailing pow'rful virtueThou subdu'st  The stubborn heart and mould'st it to thy purpose  Would I could save themBut tho' not for me  The glorious pow'r to shelter innocence  Yet for a moment to assuage its woes  Is the best sympathy the purest joy  Nature intended for the heart of man  When thus she gave the social gen'rous tear  Exit  Scene the Inside of the Cavern  Enter  ARCAS  and  EUPHRASIA  Arcas  No on my life I dare not  Euphra  But a small  A wretched pittance one poor cordial drop  To renovate exhausted drooping age  I ask no more  Arcas  Not the smallest store  Of scanty nourishment must pass these walls  Our lives were forfeit else a moment's parley  Is all I grant in yonder cave he lies  Evander  within the cell  Oh struggling nature let thy conflict end  Oh give me give me rest  Euphra  My father's voice  It pierces here it cleaves my very heart  I shall expire and never see him more  Arcas  Repose thee princess here  draws a couch  here rest thy limbs  Till the returning blood shall lend thee firmness  Euphra  The caves the rocks reecho to his groans  And is there no relief  Arcas  All I can grant  You shall commandI will unbar the dungeon  Unloose the chain that binds him to the rock  And leave your interview without restraint  Opens a cell in the back scene  Euphra  Hold hold my heart Oh how shall I sustain  The agonizing scene  rises  I must behold him  Nature that drives me on will lend me force  Is that his mansion  Arcas  Take your last farewell  His vigour seems not yet exhausted quite  You must be brief or ruin will ensue  Exit  Evan  raising

Comes gently o'er my sensesLead me forward  And is there left one charitable hand  To reach it's succour to a wretch like me  Euphra  Well may'st thou ask it Oh my breaking heart  The hand of death is

Will calm thy breast and dry those beauteous tears  A moment more shall bring him to your presence  Euphra  Ha lead him hither Sir to move him now  Aged infirm worn out with toil and years  No let me

Disastrous fate  Ruin impendsThis will discover all  I'll perish first provoke his utmost rage  Aside  Tho' much I languish to behold my father  Yet now it were not fitapproaching night  At the first dawn of day  Dion  This night this very hour  You both must meet the time forbids delay  Together you may serve the state and me  Thou see'st the havock of wide wasting war  And more full well you know are still to bleed  Thou may'st prevent their fate  Euphra  Oh give the means  And I will bless thee for it  Dion  From a Greek  Torments have wrung the truth Thy husband Phocion  Euphra  Oh say speak of my Phocion  Dion  He 'tis he  Hath kindled up this war with treacherous arts  Inflam'd the states of Greece and now the traitor  Comes with a foreign aid to wrest my crown  Euphra  And does my Phocion share Timoleon's glory  Dion  With him invests our walls and bids rebellion  Erect her standard here  Euphra  Oh bless him Gods  Where'er my hero treads the paths of war  List on his side against the hostile javelin  Uprear his mighty buckler to his sword  Lend the fierce whirlwind's rage that he may come  With wreaths of triumph and with conquest crown'd  And his Euphrasia spring with rapture to him  Melt in his arms and a whole nation's voice  Applaud my hero with a love like mine  Dion  Ungrateful fair Has not our sovereign will  On thy descendant's six'd Sicilia's crown  Have I not vow'd protection to your boy  Euphra  From thee the crown From thee Euphrasia's children  Shall on a nobler basis found their rights  On their own virtue and a people's choice  Dion  Misguided

message to your husband  Bid him draw off his Greeks unmoor his fleet  And measure back his way Full well he knows  You and your father are my hostages  And for his treason both may answer  Euphra  Think'st thou then  So meanly of my PhocionDost thou deem him  Poorly wound up to a mere fit of valour  To melt away in a weak woman's tear  Oh thou dost little know him know'st but little  Of his exalted soul With gen'rous ardour  Still will he urge the great the glorious plan  And gain the ever honour'd bright reward  Which fame intwines around the patriot's brow  And bids for ever flourish on his tomb  For nations free'd and tyrants laid in dust  Dion  By Heav'n this night Evander breathes his last  Euphra  Better for him to sink at once to rest  Than linger thus beneath the gripe of famine  In a vile dungeon scoop'd with barb'rous skill  Deep in the flinty rock a monument  Of that fell malice and that black suspicion  That mark'd your father's reign a dungeon drear  Prepar'd for innocenceVice liv'd secure  It flourish'd triumph'd grateful to his heart  'Twas virtue only could give umbrage then  In that black period to be great and good  Was a state crime the pow'rs of genius then  Were a constructive treason  Dion  Ha beware  Nor with vile calumny provoke my rage  Euphra  Whate'er was laudable whate'er was worthy  Sunk under foul oppression freeborn men  Were torn in private from their household gods  Shut from the light of Heaven in cavern'd cells  Chain'd to the grunsel edge and left to pine  In bitterness of soul while in the vaulted roof  The tyrant sat and through a secret channel  Collected ev'ry sound heard each complaint  Of martyr'd virtue kept a register  Of sighs and groans by cruelty extorted  Noted the honest language of the heart  Then on the victim's wreak'd his murd'rous rage  For yielding to the feelings of their nature  Dion  Obdurate woman obstinate in ill  Here ends all parley Now your father's doom  Is fix'd irrevocably fix'd this night  Thou shalt behold him while inventive cruelty  Pursues his wearied life through every nerve  I scorn all dull delay This very night  Shall sate my great revenge  Exit  Euphra  This night

Valer Max lib c  de Pictate in Parentes    We are told by that Author  That a woman of ingenuous birth was convicted before the PRAETOR of a capital crime and delivered over to the TRIUMVIR to be put to death in prison The jailer received her into his custody but touched with compassion did not proceed immediately to execute the sentence His humanity went so far as to admit the daughter of the unhappy criminal into the goal but not without a previous search left any nourishment should be secretly conveyed To starve the prisoner to death was his design Several days passed when it became a matter of wonder how the poor woman subsisted so long The jailer's curiosity was excited he watched the daughter narrowly and saw her give her breast to the famished mother and with her milk supply the cravings of nature Touched by the novelty of so affecting a sight he made his report to the TRIUMVIR from whom it reached the PRAETOR and the whole matter being referred to the JUDICIAL MAGISTRATES the mother received a free pardon What will not filial piety undertakeWhat place will it not penetrateWhat will it not devise when in a dungeon it finds unheard of means to preserve a parent's lifeIs there in the course of human affairs a scene so big with wonder as a mother nourished at the daughter's breastThe incident might at the first view be thought repugnant to the order of nature if TO LOVE OUR PARENTS were not the FIRST LAW stamped by the hand of Nature on the human heart  Thus far VALERIUS MAXIMUS He goes on in the same place and tells a Greek tale in which the heroine performs the fame act of piety to a father in the decline of life For the purposes of the drama the latter story has been preferred The painters long since seized the subject  and by them it has been called ROMAN CHARITY The Author has taken the liberty to place it in the reign of DIONYSIUS the Younger at the point of time when TIMOLEON laid siege to SYRACUSE The general effect it was thought would be better produced if the whole had an air of real history  Atque ita mentitur sic veris falsa remiscet  Primo ne medium medio ne discrepet imum  The Author does not wish to conceal that the subject of his Tragedy has been touched in some foreign pieces but he thinks it has been  only  touched The ZELMIRE of Mons BELLOY begins after the daughter has delivered her father out of prison The play indeed has many beauties and if the sentiments and business of that piece coincided with the design of THE GRECIAN DAUGHTER the Author would not have blushed to tread in his steps But a new fable was absolutely necessary and perhaps in the present humour of the times it is not unlucky that no more than three lines could be adopted from Mons BELLOY Every writer who makes up a story with characters and incidents already hackneyed on the English stage and invents nothing cries out with an air of triumph That he has not borrowed from the wits of FRANCE In the Isle of Man it is said there is an epitaph in these words  "He who lies here interred was never out of this island"  The poor man was to be pitied a similar inscription upon the tombstone of a modern poet would perhaps do as little honour to the memory of the deceased  The Author cannot dismiss his Play without declaring that though in love with the subject he has not satisfied even his own ideas of the drama he laments that he had neither time nor ability to make it better To heighten it with additional beauties was reserved for the decorations with which the zeal of Mr GARRICK has embellished the representation for the admirable performance of Mr BARRY and above all for the enchanting powers and the genius of Mrs BARRY  Lincoln's Inn  Feb  This Day is Published Price s d  A  New Edition  being
