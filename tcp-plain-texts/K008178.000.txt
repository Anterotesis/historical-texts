 La Vergne inn E Kirkall Sculp  THE RESURRECTION A POEM  Written by Mr ADDISON  Venient citò Saecula cum jam  Socius Calor ossa revisat  Animataque Sanguine vivo  Habitacula pristina gestet  Prud  LONDON  Printed for E CURLL in  Fleetstreet  Price Six Pence  THE PREFACE  _THE following Lines are esteemed by the best Judges to be the finest Sketch of the  Resurrection  that any Age or Language hath produced Nor do their only Excellence consist in being an  accurate  Poem  but also in being an exact Copy of the Painter's  Old  Fuller  Original upon the  Altar  in  Magdalen  College but so much improved with all the strongest Figures and most lively Embellishments of a poetical Description that the  Reader  receives a double Satisfaction in seeing the two SisterArts so useful to each other in borrowing mutual Helps and mutual Advantages  It is indeed wonderful to find in the narrow Compass of so few Pages all the most dreadful Circumstances of that last terrible Crisis of Time The  Poem  is a beautiful and succinct  Epitome  of all that hath or can ever be said  on that important Subject the very Text which the ingenious Mr  Young  hath so largely and elegantly paraphras'd upon in his excellent Poem on the LAST DAY  Mr  Addison  is to be distinguish'd thro' all his Performances both  Latin  and  English  and in his  Latin  particularly in the following one and that on the Peace of  Riswick  by the strength of his Images and by a forcible and unaffected vivacity of Expression which none of our Moderns have attain'd to in so much Perfection and which is very rarely to be met with even in any of the Antients since  Virgil  and  Horace    Having mention'd Mr  Addison  I cannot avoid congratulating my Country on his Preferment to one of her greatest Civil Employments nor forbear observing how happy we are in a KING who hath shown the World that he will distribute his Favours amongst those only whom Merit and Virtue shall recommend to his Service  With what uncommon Lustre must that Man appear to Posterity who is not only the best Writer and most candid Patron of the Age he lives in but also the finest Gentleman the sincerest Friend the most affectionate Husband the most accomplish'd  Statesman and the most exemplary Christian Under every one of these Views Mr  Addison  gains the Esteem and Admiration even of the bitterest Enemies to that Cause which he so warmly espouses of the most furious Partisans and the most prejudic'd of Mankind  I must forbear to enlarge any farther on the Character of that truly great and good Man lest I draw upon my self the imputation of a Flatterer by relating what all the World except himself only will allow to be the severest Truth  I shall make no excuse for offering the following Poem to the  World in an  English  DRESS and under all the Disadvantages of an imperfect Translation I have often read it in the Original with the greatest Pleasure and Satisfaction and I hope it will need no Apology to be willing to communicate so useful and sublime an Entertainment in the best manner I can to those of my FellowSubjects who are not qualify'd to read it in the  Latin  Original  RESURRECTIO DELINEATA  Ad Altare Col

array'd in beamy Light  And Spectres trembling at the dreadful sight  To sing O Muse the pious Bard inspire  And waken in his Breast the Sacred Fire  The hallow'd Field a bare white Wall of late  Now cloath'd in gaudy Colours shines in State  And lest some little Interval confess  It's ancient simple Form and homely Dress  The skilful Artist laid o'er every Part  The first Foundation of his future Art  O'er the wide Frame his ductile Colours led  And with thick Daubings all the Wall o'erspread  As e'er you spangling Orbs were hung on high  Lest one great Blank should yawn thro' boundless Sky  Thro' the wide heavenly Arch and trackless Road  In Azure volumes the pure  Aether  flow'd  The  Sun  at length burns out intensely bright  And the pale  Crescent  sheds her borrow'd Light  With thicksown Stars the radiant  Pole  is crown'd  Of milky Glories a long Tract is found  O'erflows and whitens all the Heav'ns around  So when the Groundwork of the Piece was laid  Nor yet the Painter had his Art display'd  With slower Hand and Pencil more divine  He blends each Colour heightens ev'ry Line  Till various Forms the breathing Picture wears  And a mute  Groupè  of Images appears  Celestial Guards the topmost height attend  And Crouds of Angels o'er the Wall descend  With their big Cheeks the deaf'ning Clarions wind  Whose dreadful Clangors startle all Mankind  Ev'n the Dead hear the Lab'ring Graves Conceive  And the swoln Clod in Picture seems to heave  Ten thousand Worlds revive to better Skies  And from their Tombs the thronging Coarses rise  So when fam'd  Cadmus  sow'd the fruitful Field  With pregnant Throws the quicken'd Furrow swell'd  From the warm Soil sprung up a warlike Train  And Human harvests cover'd all the Plain  And now from ev'ry Corner of the Earth  The scatter'd Dust is call'd to second Birth  Whether in Mines it form'd the rip'ning Mass  Or humbly mix'd and flourish'd in the Grass  The sever'd Body now unites again  And kindred Atoms rally into Men  The various Joynts resume their ancient Seats  And ev'ry Limb its former Task repeats  Here an imperfect Form returns to Light  Not half renew'd dishonest to the Sight  Maim'd of his Nose appears his blotted Face  And scarce the Image of a Man we trace  Here by Degrees infus'd the vital Ray  Gives the first Motion to the panting Clay  Here on the guilty Brow pale Horrors glare  And all the Figure labours with  Despair    From Scenes like these now turn thy wond'ring Sight  And if thou can'st withstand such Floods of Light  Look where thy SAVIOUR fills the middle Space  The Godhead op'ning in his awful Face  See what mild Beams their gracious Influence shed  And how the pointed Radiance crowns his Head  Around his Temples lambent Glories shine  And on his Brow sits Majesty Divine  His Eyeballs lighten the Celestial Fires  And ev'ry Grace to Speak the God conspires  How chang'd from him who came to be Betray'd  And who for Man the precious Ransom paid  Who did on Earth such arduous Toils sustain  And patient bore an irksom Life of Pain  But Death and Hell subdu'd the Deity  Ascends Triumphant to his native Sky  And rising far above th' Aethereal Height  The Sun and Moon diminish'd to his Sight  And now to View he bare'd his bleeding side  And his pierc'd Hands and Feet in Crimson dy'd  Still did the Nails the recent Scars reveal  And bloody Tracks of the transfixing Steel  Hither in Crouds the  Blessed  shape their Flight  And throng the Mansions of Immortal Light  The fruitful Matron and the spotless Maid  And Infants with a longer Life repaid  Stand round and drinking in Celestial Rays  On their REDEEMER fix with ardent Gaze  And all the Heav'ns resound with Hymns of Praise  Each Bosom Kindles with Seraphic Joy  And conscious Raptures all the Soul employ  Not equal Raptures swell the  Sybil  's Breast  When by the inmate Deity possess'd  When  Phoebus  the Prophetic Maid inspires  And her Limbs tremble with convulsive Fires  But whence this sudden Blaze of dazling Light  What Mitred Brow is that which greets my Sight  Forth from a stately Tomb he lifts his Head  And to the Skies on Angels Wings is sped  I know the Form alike the Look and Mien  Another  William Wainflet  Bishop of  Winchester  He was the Founder of  Magdalen College  and the  Hall  adjoining  WAINFLET in his Face is seen  When will alas such spotless Worth be found  When will a Mind with equal Virtues crown'd  Fearless he sees almighty Vengeance rise  And fixes on his GOD his guiltless Eyes  But now far different Scenes our Wonder claim  Horrent with Darkness and Malignant Flame▪  The labour'd Wall delusive Picture hides  And liquid Sulphur rolls in burning Tides  So Strong so fierce the painted Flames arise  The pale Spectator views them with surprize  Believes the blazing Wall indeed to burn  And fears the Frame should into Ashes turn  Hither in ghastly Crouds the Guilty haste  Obscene with Horrour and with shame defac'd  With haggard Looks the gloomy Fiends appear  They gnash their foamy Teeth and frown severe  A stern  Avenger  with relentless Mind  Waving a flamy Faulchion stalks behind  With which as once from Paradise he drove  He drives the Sinner from the Joys above  What shall he do forlorn or whither fly  To shun the Ken of an Allseeing Eye  What would he give amongst the Just to shine  And fall before Omnipotence Divine  But oh too late in Sighs he vents his Woe  Too late his Eyes with gushing Tears o'erflow  Vain are his Sighs and fruitless are his Tears  Vengeance and Justice stop th'  Almighty  's Ears  See with what various Charms the Piece is fraught  And with what pregnant Marks of Judgment wrought  With how much Grace the living Colours glow  Not brighter Colours paint the watry Bow  When the fresh Show'rs her various Lustre share  And ev'ry Drop with Spangles decks the Air  O may the Painter's Labours never fade  Nor wastful Time their shining Charms invade  'Till the first Dawn of that Eternal
