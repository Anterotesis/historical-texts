All shall be one crimson and one blazing grave  SCENE II  A Palace in Troy  Paris enters followed by his officers attended by the Grecian Messenger who delivers his credentials Paris reads and shews great joy at the contents of the letter expressive of the Greek's design of raising the siege then as an offering to Pallas for having obtained the Palladium by treachery they beg to present Paris with a horse as an atonement for the wrongs committed by them Paris consults with his officers who persuade him to agree with the proposals he embraces them and dispatches the Grecian messenger with every mark of satisfaction at the supposed peace with the Greeks  SCENE III  An extensive view of the surrounding country of Troy part of that city's external walls and towers sallyport c Also the sea and Port Aulis where the Grecians harboured their fleet previous to their encampment before the city  Bristle a cobbler and his wife after arguing on the retreat of the Grecians quarrel on the subject

shine  To thee to thee  We bend the knee  Our joys of triumph thine  Our foes have run  Our fears are done  The Greeks are flown and Troy's our own  After the offering to Diana a dance of female Trojans takes place which is interrupted by the arrival of a messenger from Cassandra who wishes to come from her place of confinement  detained there as a lunatic  to expound a prophecy Paris after some deliberation complies with the request the messenger retires and soon after returns with Cassandra who deplores her situation in consequence of being treated as one deranged in mind she informs Paris of the approaching danger of Troy Paris the Priests Priestesses c shew every mark of disbelief which enrages Cassandra who seizing her wand from her attendant invokes the Gods informs Paris that she has the power to perform a miracle and determines that instant to put it to the test then leave him to judge of the truth of her prophecy Cassandra strikes the figures of the Gods which change from gold to black marble  Paris and the rest are seized with horror The actions displayed by the various groups expressive of fear hope and revenge forms the most lively and interesting picture of the various passions that agitate the human breast which it is possible to convey through the medium of scenic effect  SCENE V  Outside view of the fortifications of Troy c  Various Trojans are seen going to welcome the arrival of the great horse  SONG  Bristle  I  Be silent my neighbours and listen to me  For if you keep wrangling you'll never agree  If I'm wrong put somebody else in my stead  Nobody's worth nothing without they've a head  Derry down c  II  At night when we go to our fourpenny club  To smoke our tobacco and tipple our bub  The chairman cries silenceno more's to be said  Which proves that nobody can do with no head  Derry down c  III  Let the head and the body unanimous be  For the body and head should ne'er disagree  The head of the body should ne'er be in dread  'Tis a very bad body would cut off the head  Derry down c  IV  And now I am come to the end of my song  As a body of people let no one do wrong  The way to keep enemies always in dread  Make the  subjects the body  the sov'reign the head  Derry down c  SCENE VI  The scene opens and discovers six pieces of paintings representing a street of magnificent buildings in Troy with the Trojan horse in the center adorned with all the trappings and furniture of a War Horse decorated with rich gildings plumes of feathers and other suitable ornaments under his feet is discovered Sinon mangled and in chains  The Trojans are seen surveying the horse whose wonderful appearance astonishes the spectators several of them comment upon his proportion c and then retire to finish the day in festivity  Ulysses opens the trap door which is so admirably contrived that the keenest eye cannot observe it descends and reconnoitres the city but being interrupted by the approach of the Trojans ascends with speed and closes the door after him  DUETT  Ulysses and Officer  PRIOR TO ASCENDING  ULYSSES  Now the glorious work draws near  But soldiers hark hark hark I hear  A noise is heard  The foe the foe at hand  OFFICER from inside of the horse  Say shall we now descend  ULYSSES  Not yet not yet my friend  The foe's at hand beware  Both  OFFICER  Then why do you stand there  Both  ULYSSES  I come I come thy caution's just  In me confide and safely trust  Since fate ordains it so  To hide to hide  To hide to hide I go  Ascends the horse's side  Several Trojans are seen returning from their rejoicings  Ulysses finding all clear appears a second time and while the Trojans are drowned in wine the Grecians who lie concealed within the WAR HORSE descend with every necessary instrument of destruction they retire to various parts of the city in order to accomplish their design at a proper signal being given first receiving their instructions from their general  ULYSSES and OFFICERS  CHORUS  Come lads descend the coast is clear  The foe destroy with axe and spear  Heap piles of fire through each street  And sheath your swords in all you meet  When this is done and Trojans slain  This night will crown our ten years pain  SCENE VII  Distant country with various pleasing views  The Trojan rabble keeping it up Bristle captain of the gang  SONG  Bristle  I  Egad we are merry with drinking of sherry  And toasting prince Paris that brave boy  We our glasses did trim quite up to the brim  And drank to the lad that did save Troy  Fal lal lal c  II  Then home let's be jogging and take t'other noggin  Be drunk both without and within doors  Like hearty good fellows we'll burn burn the bellows  And throw the whole house out of windows  Fal lal lal c  SCENE VIII  A general and extensive view of the internal part of Troy  The time being come and the signal given the Grecians execute their wellplanned project  and while the unsuspecting Trojans are buried in wine and sleep Ulysses and his party seize the gates of the city let in the covering army who enter with shouts that seem to rend the skies breaking open houses putting all to the sword without sparing age or sex the confusion becomes general palaces and other magnificent buildings fall a sacrifice to the fury of the flames  Helen is discovered in a tower surrounded with fire and no mode of escaping inevitable death  The dreadful clashing of swords and shields together with the conquest and destruction of Troy terminate this grand spectacle of which dismal catastrophe the poet gives the following emphatical description  "Who can the dreadful horrors of that night  "Declare with equal tears whose woes recite  "The old City falls potent so many years  "In ev'ry street slaughter in heaps appears  "Bodies and houses sacred temples thrown  "Nor did the Trojans suffer death alone  "The vanquished their courages recall  "And now the Grecian conquerors do fall  "From tow'ring battlements with melted lead  "In burning showers they scall'd the victors dead  "Pull down themselves their lofty spires and throw  "The massy stones and crush the daring foe  "In all parts cruel grief in all parts fear  "And death in various shapes was every where"  GRAND CHORUS  SINCE mighty Troy in ashes lies  Let's raise our triumph to the skies  For future ages shall relate  The  Grecians  fame and  Trojans  fate  Nor e'er shall hoary  Time  destroy  The page that tells the Siege of Troy  REMARKS  PERHAPS no subject ever afforded a greater scope for the painter's pencil or the ingenuity of the machinist in point of stageeffect than the Famous SIEGE of TROY nor has the composer had a less field for his musical abilities It will be seen that the performers in general have each their share of business in this splendid and heroic spectacle and are not wanting in pantomimic action to convey a proper idea of the nature of the siege as well as the credulity of the besieged in admitting within their walls the grand Trojan War Horse which contained five hundred Grecian soldiers properly equipped for battle c within its body  ☞ The pantomime will be given every evening till further notice
