 A FIFTH DISCOURSE ON THE MIRACLES OF OUR  SAVIOUR    In VIEW of the Present Controversy between INFIDELS and APOSTATES  Ridiculum acri  Fortius melius magnas plerum{que} secat Res  The Second Edition  By THO WOOLSTON B D sometime Fellow of  SidneyCollege  in  Cambridge  LONDON Printed for the Author and Sold by him next door to the  Star  in  Aldermanbury  and by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price One Shilling  TO THE Right Reverend Father in God  THOMAS  Lord BISHOP of  Bangor  MY LORD  _WHatever we poor  Authors  may sometimes pretend to by the Dedication of our Works to  Great  Men it's certain we aim at nothing less than Rewards we deserve them or not That this is my Design in  Dedications  is so apparent that it's to no Purpose to deny or dissemble it  Wherefore else have I made Choice of some of our Learned and Wealthy  Bishops  for the Patrons of  these  Discourses  which I foresaw would be grateful to their nice and critical Palates Wherefore else have I been so profuse of such Compliments on their  Lordships  as I was sure they would take great Pleasure in Wherefore else  My Lord  do I inscribe  this  to your  Right Reverend  Name but that I expect your Approbation of it and  Some who are envious  My Lord  of my good Fortune in  Episcopal  Patrons will not believe that I have receiv'd so much as one  Purse  of  Gold  for any of my  Dedications  but I would have such Malignants to know that the less I have receiv'd the more there is behind And I can moreover assure them that their  Lordships  have it in their Heads and their Hearts too highly to advance me in the World and if their Endeavours for my Promotion fail not I shall be a very  Great  Man  Such primitive Doctrine  My Lord  as I have reviv'd must in the Judgment of our  Bishops  be deserving of their distinguish'd Favours And if they should Design for me such a  mystical  Crown of Glory as the  Gentile Priests  help'd some of the Fathers of the Church to I profess without Dissimulation that for all my Love to  Mysteries  it will be more than I am ambitious of But if the Honour is forc'd on me it will be my Duty to their  Lordships  to sound an  allegorical  Trumpet of their Fame that their Names which might otherwise be soon forgotten may be everlastingly remember'd for their Love and Goodwill towards me  But the chief Foundation  My Lord  of my Merits lies they say in my Treatment of the Miracles of our Saviour after the Manner you handled a ScriptureProphecy of a  Man's kicking a Serpent on the Pate for biting him by the Heels    And if your  Lordship  got a  WelshBishoprick  upon it what may not I expect for my more meritorious Works of the same kind The Great  Mr Scheme  has celebrated your Praise for that Effort of your Wit And I must needs say to your  Lordship  's Applause that were not your Thoughts unhappily shackled with Interest and Subscriptions an Unhappiness you sadly lament you would endeavour to make as pleasant Work with the  Letter  of the  Old  as I can do with that of the  New  Testament  I have not here Room  My Lord  for a sufficient and deserv'd  Encomium  on your  Use and Intent of Prophecy  therefore must be content to say of it in short that it is a most curious Piece of what the Fathers call  Engastromuthism  or such a singular Specimen of a Webb spun out of a Man's own Bowels as one of fewer Brains in his Head can hardly equal  It was wisely done of your  Lordship  to caution your Readers against taking your  Book  for an Answer to Mr  Grounds  otherwise it had not been impossible but some others as well as the  Worshipful Benchers  of the  Temple  might have mistaken the  Use  and  Intent  of it  After I had gone thro' your  beautifullyprinted  Work I wish'd  My Lord  for another  Decoration  of it that some Annotations out of the Fathers had been subjoin'd to it How would your Notions then and Theirs about Prophecy have stood as a  Foil  to each other How should I then have admired the Difference between a  Rich  Bishop and a  Poor  Father as to Wit and Sense How should I then have contemplated the Usefulness of Ecclesiastical Wealth in our  Clergy  for the Understanding of the Inspirations of the poor old Prophets  When your  Lordship  is call'd upon for another Edition of your  Book    vouchsafe me the Favour of making some marginal Remarks on it which shall not be without their good Use As you know savoury Sawce makes some sort of Food go down the better so a little more of that Salt which Mr  Scheme  has too sparingly sprinkled on your  Work  will give your  Readers  a right Relish of it But whether I am indulg'd this Favour or not I shall take another opportunity according to Promise elsewhere made of testifying to the World how much I am  My LORD  The Admirer of Your  Use  and  Intent  of Prophecy  Thomas Woolston  October  A FIFTH DISCOUsRSE ON THE MIRACLES OF OUR  SAVIOUR  c  _ACcording to Promise in my last  Discourse  I am in  this  to take into Examination the three Miracles of  Jesus  's raising the dead  viz  Of  Iairus  's Daughter  Mat ix Mark v Luke viii  of the Widow of  Naim  's Son  Luke vii  and of  Lazarus  John xi  The literal Stories of which  I shall show to consist of Absurdities Improbabilities and Incredibilities in Order to the mystical Interpretation of them And because some of our  Bishops  and  Clergy  were a little disgusted at the ludicrous Treatment of the  Letter  of some foregoing Miracles I will handle these with the more Caution being as unwilling as any Man of my primitive Faith can be to offend weak Brethren  Whether  Jesus  rais'd any more from the dead besides the foresaid three Persons is uncertain from the Evangelical History St  Augustin  Quot autem mortuos visibiliter suscitaverat quis novit non enim omnia quae fecit scripta sunt  Johannes  hoc dicit multa alia fecit Jesus quae si scripta essent arbitror totum Mundum non posse Libros capere Multi ergo sunt alii sino dubio suscitati sed non frustra tres commemorati  In Serm  xcviii  thinks he rais'd many others and he founds his Opinion on the modest  Hyperbole  of St  John  who supposes  John xxi  the World it self could not contain the Books that might be Written of Jesus  And  Eusebius Gallicanus  of whose Mind entirely I am says  Non autem vacat a Mysterio quod cum plur  Dominus suscitaverat tres tantum Evangelistae eum suscitasse scripserunt  In Homil  quintae post Dominic    tam  the Reason lies in the Mystery why these  three  and no more than these  three  Miracles of this  Kind are recorded by the  Evangelists  But since our  Divines  are averse to Mysteries on Miracles I would gladly know their Opinion whether  Jesus  rais'd any others from the dead or not I have made some search into modern Writers for their Opinion in this Case but can't find it And unless I knew their Opinion it would be lost Labour to argue against either Side of the Question and much more against both Sides of it But I can assure our  Divines  that which Side of the Question soever they should hold the Consequence upon the Argument would be neither better nor worse than that they must of necessity espouse the mystical and allegorical Interpretation of these Miracles or grant that  Jesus  literally rais'd none from the dead at all  But waving that sort of Argument for the present against the  Letter  these three Miracles are reputed the greatest that  Jesus  wrought And I believe it will be granted on all hands that the restoring a Person indisputably dead to Life again is a stupendous Miracle and that two or three such Miracles well circumstanced and credibly reported are enough to conciliate the Belief of Mankind that the Author of them was a divine Agent and invested with the Power of God or he  could not do them But God knows and for the sake of the Mystery I am not sorry to say it this is far from being the Case of these three Miracles before us or of any one them  That these three Miracles are not equally great but differ in Degree is visible enough to any one that but cursorily reads and compares theirs Stories one with another The Fathers of the Church  Suscitaverat Dominus filiam Jairi Principis Synagogr sed adhuc mediante morte adhuc viante Spiritu  huc Anima Claustra Tartari nesciente Suscitavit unicum Matris filium sed sic ut retineret Pheretrum ut anticiparet Sepulchrum ut Corruptionem suspenderet praeven  ret faetorem ut ante mortuo Vitam redderet quam tota mortuus jura Mortis intraret Circa Lazarum vero quod geritur totum singulare est quem circa  Mortis impleta est  In Pet Chrysol Serm  lxiii  have taken Notice of such a Difference amongst them The greatest of the three and indeed the  Inter omnia Miracula quae fecit Dominus noste Jesu Christus Lazari Resurrectio  praecipue praedicatur  St August in Loc Johan  greatest Miracle that  Jesus  is suppos'd to have wrought is that of  Lazarus  's Resurrection which in Truth was a most prodigious Miracle if his Corps was putrified and stank or if there were no just Exceptions to be made to the Credibility of the Story Next to that in magnitude is  Jesus  's raising of  the Widow's Son as they were carrying him to his Burial And a great Miracle it was to bring him to Life again if none before or since had been mistaken for dead and carried to their Graves alive or if no Impostor and his Confederates could frame such a seemingly miraculous Scene as is that whole Story to his own Glory The least of the three is that of his raising  Jairus  's Daughter which in Appearance is so far from a Miracle that according to the Story itself she was but asleep or by the Shrieks of Bystanders frighted out of her Senses for the present  But however it really might be with these three supposed dead and revived Persons the Case of none of them was well enough circumstanced to serve the Purpose of our  Divines  I am apt to believe with the Fathers that  Jesus  actually did raise the dead but then as these Miracles are only recorded for the sake of the  Mystery  I affirm that none of them as to the  Letter  will abide the Test of a critcal Examination nor stand its Ground against such Exceptions as may be made to them If  Jesus  was to raise any dead Bodies to Life for a Testimony of his divine Power and Authority he would and should have made Choice of other dead Persons under other Circumstances of Death and  the History of their Resurrection should have been more credibly and carefully transmitted to Posterity so as there should have been no Room left to make a reasonable Doubt of the Truth of it But this I say is not the Case in the Resuscitation of any of these Persons as will appear from the following Remarks and Observations upon them And  Observe that the unnatural and preposterous Order of Time in which these Miracles are related justly brings them all under suspicion of Fable and Forgery The greatest of the three is indisputably that of  Lazarus  's Resurrection but since this is only mention'd by St  John  who wrote his Gospel after the other  Evangelists  and above sixty Years according to the best Computation after our Lord's Ascension here is too much Room for Cavil and Question whether this Story be not entirely his Invention What could be the Reason that  Matthew    Mark  and  Luke  who all wrote their Gospels before  John  and many Years nearer to the Death of our Saviour should omit to record this remarkable and most illustrious Miracle of  Lazarus  They could not forget it nor be ignorant of it if the Story had been really true and to assign any  other Reason than Ignorance or Forgetfulness is hard and impossible To aggrandize the Fame of their Master for a Worker of Miracles was the Design of all the  Evangelists  especially of the three first who may be presumed to make a Report of the greatest if not of all that  Jesus  wrought But that there should come after them an  Evangelist  with an huge and superlatively great Miracle and meet with Credit for it is against all Sense and Reason neither is there any Story so disorderly told in all History that  Critics  will admit of the Belief of The first Writer of the Life of an  Hero  to be sure makes mention of all the grand Occurrences of it and leaves no Room for  Biographers  afterwards but to enlarge and paraphrase upon what he has written with some other Circumstances and Additions of less Moment If a third or a fourth  Biographer  after him shall presume to add a more illustrious Transaction of the  Hero  's Life it will be rejected as Fable and Romance tho' for no other Reason than this that the first Writer must have been appris'd of it and would have inserted its Story if there had been any Truth in it And whether St  John  's Story of  Lazarus  's Resurrection that Miracle of Miracles ought not to be subjected to the like Criticism upon it  Christians  may consider and  Infidels  will judge  What then was the Reason I ask again that the three first  Evangelists  neglected to record this renown'd Miracle of  Lazarus  And why too may I enquire here did not  Matthew  and  Mark  mention the Story of the Widow of  Naim  's Son as they could not but know of it if true more certainly than  Luke  the Companion of  Paul  who alone has made a Report of it  Grotius  says  Mirum videri potest Historiam hanc tam illustrem a Matthae  Marco omissam  In Loc Luc  it may seem strange that this illustrious Miracle of the Widow's Son  was omitted by  Matthew  and  Mark  And what is the Reason that  Grotius  gives for this strange Omission Why he tells us  Sed videtur mihi horum uter{que} contentus fui  uno Exemplo redditae Vitae in Jairi filia ex quo similia alia possunt intelligi  In Loc Luc  that these two Evangelists were content with one miraculous Instance of this Kind by which Christians might judge of  Jesus'  s Power in others also  And is this Reason sufficient True it is they were content with one Instance but if they had made a Report of two or three more of the same sort no body would have thought their History of  Christ  overcharg'd with impertinent and tautological Repetitions  But one Instance of a Person rais'd from the dead they were says  Grotius  content with And I'll grant one to be sufficient But which then should they as wise and considerate  Historians  have made Choice of the greatest or the least Miracle The greatest to be sure and that was of  Lazarus  or of the Widow's Son if they knew of either But instead of either of these they tell us the Story of  Jairus  's Daughter that is  Nondum perfecta Mors est in Puella  St August  in Serm xcviii  an imperfect and disputable Miracle in Comparison of the other two which consequently they knew nothing at all of or they would have preferr'd the Report of them  If  Matthew  the first Writer had recorded only the Story of  Lazarus  whose Resurrection was the greatest Miracle and if  Luke  had added  that  of the Widow of  Naim  's Son and  John  lastly had remember'd us of  Jairus  's Daughter which the other  Evangelists  not through Ignorance or Forgetfulness but studying Brevity had omitted then all had been well and no Objection had hence lain against the Credit of any of these Miracles or against the Authority of the  Evangelists  But this unnatural and preposterous  Order of Time in which these Miracles are recorded the greatest being postponed to the least administers just Occasion of suspicion of the Truth and Credibility of all their Stories And it is lucky for Christianity that  Jews  and  Infidels  have not hitherto hit upon the  Absurdity  of this preposterous Narration or they might have form'd a cogent Objection against these Miracles thus saying  "  Jesus  it is manifest rais'd not the dead at all The only Person that Christians can reasonably pretend he did raise was  Jairus  's Daughter whom  Matthew  writes of and she according to the Story was only in a Sleep or an Extacy when  Jesus  revived her But the  Galileans  who were after a Time call'd  Christians  finding their Account in a ResurrectionMiracle  Luke  for the former Advantage of the Cause devised another Story of better Circumstances in the Widow of  Naim  's Son But this not being so great a Miracle as the Church still wanted  John  when no body was alive to contradict and expostulate with him for it trumps up a long Story of a thumping Miracle in  Jesus  's raising of  Lazarus  who had been not only dead but buried so long  that he stank again But to prove the Story of this Miracle to be false and fabulous we need say no more than that it was last recorded If there had been any Truth in it the first  Evangelist  would have remember'd us of it  "We don't suppose that you Christians because of your Prejudices will subscribe to this Account that we thus give of the Rise of these Miracles But this is certain that if these three Miracles had not been reported of  Jesus  but of  Mahomet  in the same disorder of Time by three different Historians you would presently have scented the Forgery and Imposture You would justly have affirm'd that the three Stories were apparently three Fables and Falshoods and that the three Historians visibly strove to outstretch each other That the  first  was sparing and modest in his Romance and the  second  being sensible of the Insufficiency of the former's Tale devises a Miracle of a bigger Size which still not proving sufficient to the End proposed the  third  Writer rather than his Prophet's Honour should sink for want of a ResurrectionMiracle forges a Story of a monstrously huge one against which it is and always will be Objection enough that it was not  related by the first Historian So would you Christians argue against these three Miracles in another Impostor's Case and there is not a judicious  Critic  in the Universe that would not approve of the Argument and applaud the Force of it tho' you will not endure the Thoughts of it in the Case of your  Jesus  "But to come nearer home to you supposing  John  who was then above a Hundred and in his Dotage had not reported this Miracle of  Lazarus  but that  Clement  joining it with his  In Epist prima ad Corinth Cap xxv  incredible Story of the Resurrection of a  Phaenix  or  Ignatius  or  Polycarp  or the Author of the  Apostolical Constitutions  had related it would not your Christian  Critics  have been at work to explode it There is not an antient extraevangelical Tradition of any Note about  Jesus  that some or other of your  Critics  have not boggled at but such a Story as this of  Lazarus  would have been received by none I question whether Mr  Whiston  would not have rejected the  Constitutions  upon such a Story in them or if his Fancy for some other Things in them had overcome his  Reason against this yet  Bishop Smallbroke  who has written against the Canonicalness of the  Constitutions  with his judicious Animadversions upon this Story would absolutely have overthrown their Authority And what would he have said here Not only that the Miracle smells rankly of Forgery and Fraud or the  Evangelists  especicially  Matthew  had never forgotten to record it but he would have reminded us of intrinsic Notes  hereafter to be mention'd  of Absurdity and Incredibility that would for ever have cashier'd the Belief of it And whether we  Infidels  ought not to take the same Liberty to criticize on  John  's Gospel which you do on your Apostolical Fathers who wrote before him let the impartial and unprejudiced judge If in justice we ought to take it we are sure we could give two or three notable Reasons but that We will not now put Christians out of Temper with them why  John  may be suspected of a Mistake or Fraud in this Miracle rather than any other Christian Writer of the  first  or  second  Century"  To such an unhappy Objection arising from the unnatural and preposterous Order of Time in which they are recorded  are these three Miracles before us obnoxious And I am thinking how Ministers of the Letter will be able to get over it As for my self who am for the mystical Interpretation of these Miracles I have a solid and substantial Answer at hand to the foresaid Objection an Answer that curiously accounts for the Order of Time in which these Miracles are related but my Answer will not please our  Divines  nor stand them in any stead therefore they must look up another good one of their own that will comport with the  Letter  or the said Objection improved with another presently against  Lazarus  's Resurrection will be too hard not for Christianity it self but for their Ministry  Grotius  being aware of the foresaid Objection has given us such a  Quaeri solet cur hanc tam nobilem Historiam priores Evangelii scriptores non attigerint Mihi hoc succurrit cum illi scriberent vixisse resuscitatum Lazarum periculum ei fuisse a judaeis si quod illi acciderat palam vulgaretur Nam etiam mox narratur C xii ob hoc ipsum structas ei insidias Quare visum illis hoc ad tempus subticeri posse cum alia Exempla resuscitatorum suppeterent At mortuo Lazaro cum jam nemini Periculum ex rei Narratione fieri posset additum hoc a Johanne in hac quasi praetermissorum Collectione  In Loc Johan  Solution of it as then occurr'd to his Thoughts Dr  Whitby  not being satisfied with  Grotius  's  Solution has given us  The last of the three  Evange lists  writing but fifteen Years after our Lord's Ascension might think it needless to mention a Miracle concerning a Person living so near  Jerusalem  where there was so great a Fame thereof and so many living Witnesses St  John  writing his Gospel say the Ancients above sixty Years after our Lord's Ascension when by the Deaths of the Person and most of the Witnesses that were present at his Resurrection the Memory and Fame of it might be much impair'd had great Reason to perpetuate the Memory of it by this large Rehearsal of it  In Loc Johan  another But how weak and insufficient both their Solutions are I will not spare Time to consider till some  Writer  shall appear in Defence of the Sufficiency and Strength of one or other of them And so I pass to a  Second Observation by Way of Objection to the  Letter  of these Miracles and that is by enquiring what became of these three Persons after their Resurrection How long did they live afterwards And of what Use and Advantage were their restored  ives to the Church or to Mankind The Evangelical and Ecclesiastical History is entirely silent as to these Questions which is enough to make us suspect their Stories to be merely romantick or parabolical and that there were no such Persons rais'd from the dead or we must have heard somewhat of their Station and  Conversation in the World afterwards It's true that  Ephiphanius  Quin illud inter traditiones reperimus triginta tum Annos natum fuisse Lazaru  cum a mortuis excitatus est at{que} idem ille postea triginta aliis annis vixit  In Haeres  lxvi  Sect    says what he found among Traditions that  Lazarus  lived thirty Years after his Resurrection But how did he spend his Time all that while Was it to the Honour of  Jesus  to the Service of the Church and Progagation of the Gospel Of that we know nothing tho in Reason and Gratitude to  Jesus  his Benefactor it ought to have been so spent and if it had been so employ'd History surely would have inform'd us of it According to the Opinion of  Grotius  in a Citation above  Lazarus  for the rest of his restored Life absconded and skull'd about the Country for Fear of the  Jews  who lay in Wait for him which is a Suggestion not only dishonourable to  Jesus  as if the same Power that rais'd him from the dead could not protect him against his Enemies but reproachful to  Lazarus  himself who should have chosen to suffer Death again rather than not bear an open Testimony to  Jesus  the Author of his Resurrection However it was we hear no more of  Lazarus  than that he lived thirty Years afterwards which Tradition  without other Memorials of his Life brings the Miracle more under suspicion of Fable than if he had dy'd soon after it And of  Jairus  's Daughter and of the Widow of  Naim  's Son which is astonishing we read nothing at all Does not this Silence in History about them make their Miracles questionable and but like  Gulliverian  Tales of Persons and Things that out of the Romance never had any Being  Jesus  did but  Matt xviii  call a little Child and set him in the midst  of his Disciples and that Act was remember'd in the Piety and Zeal  In Nicephor Callist Eccl Hist L ii c  of  Ignatius  who made a renown'd Bishop But the Favour and Blessing conferr'd on these three rais'd Persons was exceedingly greater and one might have expected that  Lazarus  and the Widow's Son would have been eminent Ministers of the Gospel But instead of that their Lives afterwards were pass'd in Obscurity or what's as bad Ecclesiastical History has neglected a Report of them What can any one hereupon think less than that the Favour of the Miracles was lost on undeserving Persons which I abhor the Thoughts of or that their Stories  are but Parables which I rather incline to  Ministers of the  Letter  may here say "That the Ecclesiastical History of the Apostolical Age is very scanty and that many Memorials of other Persons and Transactions are lost and buried in Oblivion Which unhappy Fate has attended the afterLives and Actions of these rais'd Persons or undoubtedly we should have had a famous Record of them" This is not impossible tho' in the Wisdom of Providence it is hardly probable but that some more Remembrance must have been left of one or other if not of all the three Persons in as much as such a Remembrance of them would nowadays have no less gain'd a Belief of the Miracles than this Historical Silence tends to the Discredit of them  It's somewhat strange that we hear no more of the afterFame and Life of any of the diseased Persons whom  Jesus  miraculously cured excepting of the Woman heal'd of an Issue of Blood who tho' she  spent  ALL  she had    even  ALL  her Living  upon  Physicians  yet out of the Remains of it erected says  In Eccl Hist L vii c  Eusebius  at  Caesarea Philippi  two most costly Statues of Brass to the Memory of  Jesus  and of herself and of the Miracle wrought by him which Dr  Whitby  In Loc Matthaei  as if he was tainted with Infidelity endeavours to make an idle Tale of But excepting I say this Story of this Woman we hear nothing of any other heal'd Person which is Matter of some Speculation But that the Persons rais'd from the dead should not at all be mention'd in History for their Labours and Lives afterwards to the Honour of  Jesus  is absolutely unaccountable Whether such a profound Silence in History about them be not shocking of the Credit of the Miracles let our  Divines  consider I am of Opinion that if  Jesus  really rais'd these Persons from the dead this and no other Reason in the Providence of God can be given for the Silence of Ecclesiastical History about them afterwards than to make  deadletter'd  Stories of their Miracles in order to turn our Heads entirely to the Consideration of their mystical Signification without which the  Letter  for the Argument before us is deserving of no Regard nor Credit But  By way of Objection to the  Letter  of these three Miracles let us consider the  Condition of the Persons rais'd from the dead and whether they were at all proper Persons for  Jesus  to work such a Miracle upon in Testimony of his divine Power If they were improper Persons according to the  Letter  it's not credible that He who was the Wisdom of God would raise them or if he did it was because they were the properest to make mystical Emblems of their Stories  That  Jesus  ought to have rais'd all that dy'd whereever he came during the Time of his Ministry none I presume can hold Two or three Instances of his almighty and miraculous Power of this Kind will be allow'd to be sufficient But then they must be wisely and judiciously made Choice of out of a vast Number of Persons that must needs die in that Time Where then was his Wisdom and Prudence to chuse these three Persons above others to that Honour Why were all of them or indeed any one of them preferr'd to other Persons of a different Age and Condition in the World Nay if the  Letter  of their Stories is only to be regarded were not all these three Persons almost the improperest and most unfit of any for  Jesus  to exercise that Power on  Jairus  's Daughter was an insignificant  Girl  of twelve Years old And there could be no Reason for raising her but to wipe Sorrow from the Hearts and Tears from the Eyes of her Parents who ought to have been better Philosophers than immoderately to grieve for her And was here a good Reason for  Jesus  to interpose with his Almighty Powe No certainly a Lecture of Patience and Resignation in this Case had been enough And tho  Jesus  could raise her from the dead yet for as much as that Favour was to be conferr'd but on a few and his Miracles ought to be useful as well as conspicuous she should have been pass'd by as an improper Object of his Power in Comparison of many others presently to be named If therefore a better Reason than what's discernible in the  Letter  is not to be fetch'd from the Mystery I can't suppose that  Jesus  the Wisdom of God would raise this  Girl  but that the modern Beleif of her Resuscitation exclusive of the mystical Signification is as shall be by and by argued altogether groundless  The Widow of  Naim  's Son too was but a  Youth  and whether any thing older than the  Girl  above is doubtful but his Life certainly was of no more Importance to the World after than  before his Resurrection And why was he then one of the  three  to be rais'd from the dead Why had he this Honour done him before others of greater Age Worth and Use to MankInd Some will say for the Comfort of his sorrowful Mother And is this Reason sufficient A Discourse on the Pleasures of  Abraham  's Bosom where she would e'er long meet her Son had been enough to chear her Heart If therefore the Fathers don't help me to a solid mystical Reason why the Son and  only Son  of a Widow was to be rais'd by  Jesus  as they were carrying him to his Burial I'll not believe He would raise this dead  Boy  rather than many others for the Manifestation of his Power but that the Story of his Resurrection as shall soon be reasonably proved was all Sham and Cheat  Lazarus  indeed was  Jesus  's Friend whom he Loved and as I will not question but  Jesus  's Affection was wisely and deservedly placed on him so here to Appearance was a better Reason for the raising of him than of either of the other Two But even this Reason supposing  Jesus  was to raise but three Persons is not sufficient against the Cases of many others that may be put for the Manifestation of his Power for the Illustration of his Wisdom and Goodness and for the  Conversion of Unbelievers Consequently if this Story of  Lazarus  be not parabolical the litteral Fact is disputable and obnoxious to such Exceptions presently to be observed against it as will not be easily got over  Jesus  rais'd the dead and wrought other Miracles say our  Divines  often not only to manifest his own Power and Glory but his Love to Mankind and his Inclination to do them good For which Reason his Miracles are useful and beneficial as well as stupendous and supernatural Acts on purpose to conciliate Men's Affections as well as their Faith to him On this Topick our  Divines  are copious and rhetorical when they write on  Jesus  's Miracles as if no more useful and wonderful Works could be done than what he did And I do agree with them that what Reason bespeaks the Miracles of a pretended Author of Religion ought to be both as useful and great as well as could be But such were not  Jesus  's Miracles according to  Letter  and least of all his Acts of raising the dead For if we consider the Persons rais'd by him we shall find he could hardly have exerted his Power on any of less Importance to the World both before and after their Resurrection A young  Girl  indeed is fitter to be rais'd  than a decripid old Woman who by the Course of Nature was to return to Corruption again as soon as restored to Life And a  Boy  rather than an infirm old Man for the same Reason And  Lazarus  the Friend of  Jesus  perhaps and but perhaps rather than his profess'd Enemy But what are these three Persons in Comparison of many others of other Circumstances Instead of a  Boy  and a  Girl  and even of  Lazarus  who were all of no Consequence to the Publick either before or since I should think  Jesus  ought to have rais'd an useful Magistrate whose Life had beed a common Blessing an industrious Merchant whose Death was a publick Loss a Father of a numerous Family which for a comfortable Subsistance depended on him Such dead Objects of  Jesus  's Power and Compassion could not but offer themselves during the Time of his Ministry and if he meant to be as useful as he could in his Miracles he would have laid hold on them If a few Persons only were to be rais'd from the dead the foresaid were the properest whose Resurrection and Return to Life would have begotten the Applause as well as the Wonder of the World would most extensively have spread  Jesus  's Fame and would have gain'd him the Love and  Discipleship of all that heard of his being so great a Benefactor to Mankind Such Instances of his Power would have demonstrated him to be a most benign as well as a mighty Agent and none in Interest or Prejudice could have open'd their Mouths against him especially if the Persons rais'd from the dead were selected upon the Recommendation of the People of this or that City But that an insignificant  Boy  and a  Girl  forsooth and the obscure  Lazarus  are preferr'd by  Jesus  to such publick and more deserving Persons is unaccountable Their Story therefore upon this Argument savours of Romance and Fraud and unless the  Mystery  help us to what the  Letter  can't a good Reason for  Jesus  's Conduct here the Miracles may be hence justly question'd and the Credibility of their Report disputed  But now I am speaking of the Fitness and Unfitness of deceased Persons to have this grand Miracle wrought on them it comes into my Head to ask why  Jesus  rais'd not  John  the Baptist to Life again A Person of greater Merits and more worthy of the Favour of  Jesus  and of this Miracle could not be If  Jesus  could raise any from the dead he would surely have raised him and why did he not This is a reasonable Question and an  Answer should be thought on for it Was it a Thing out of  Jesus  's Power Not so He was Omnipotent and could by Force or Persuasion have rescued  John  's Head out of the Hands of his Enemies and the tacking it again to his Body and the infusing new Life into him was no more difficult to  Jesus  than the Resuscitation of a stinking Carcass If  Jesus  had here exerted his Power and rais'd his dearest Friend and choicest Minister for the Preparation if not Propagation of the Gospel none could question his Ability to raise any others tho he had rais'd no more But in as much as  John  the  Baptist  one of his singular Merits and Services to  Christ  was overlook'd and neglected by him and three useless and insignificant Persons had this Honour done them the Facts may reasonably be called into question and if the Mysteries don't solve the Difficulty their litteral Stories may hence be accounted foolish fictitious and fabulous especially if we consider  That none of these three rais'd Persons had been long enough dead to amputate all Doubt of  Jesus  's miraculous Power in their Resurrection As to  Jairus  's Daughter she was but newly expired if at all dead when  Jesus  brought her to  Life again  Jesus  himself says she was but asleep And according to  Theophanes Cerameus  Puellam ex illo Tumultu plangentium stupore correptam esse non vero defunctam  In Homil de Juri filia  and  Theophilact  In Loc Matthae  there is Room to suspect that this  Girl  was only  beside herself  And it is not impossible but the passionate Skreams of the Feminine Bystanders might fright her into Fits that bore the Appearance of Death otherwise why did  Jesus  turn these inordinate Weepers out of the House before he could bring her to her Senses again And why did he tell her Parents that she was only in asleep but to Comfort them with the Possibility of his awakening her out of it Is not this destructive of the Miracle and making no more of it than what another Man might do And is there not some Probability that here's all of this Story But supposing she was really dead yet for the sake of an indisputable Miracle in her Resurrection it must be granted that she ought to have been much longer some Days if not Weeks dead and buried  As to the Widow of  Naim  's Son there was somewhat more of the Appearance of Death in him than in  Jairus  's Daughter He was carried forth to his Burial and so may be presumed to be really a dead  Corpse But might not here be Fraud or Mistake in the Case History and common Fame affords Instances of the mistaken Deaths of Persons who sometimes have been unfortunately buried alive and at other Times happily by one Means or other restored to Life And who knows but  Jesus  upon some Information or other might suspect this Youth to be in a lethargick State and had a Mind to try if by chafeing  c  he could not do what successfully he did bring him to his Senses again Or might not a Piece of Fraud be here concerted between  Jesus  a subtil Youth and his Mother and others and all the Formalities of a Death and Burial contrived that  Jesus  whose Fame for a Worker of Miracles was to be rais'd might here have an Opportunity to make a shew of a grand one The Mourning of the Widow who had her Tears at Command and  Jesus  's casual meeting of the Corpse upon the Road looks like Contrivance to put the better Face upon the Matter God forbid that I should suspect there was any Fraud of this Kind here but of the Possibility of it none can doubt And where there is a Possibility of Fraud it is Nonsense and mere Credulity to talk of a real certain and stupendous Miracle especially where  the Juggler and pretended Worker of Miracles has been detected in some of his other Tricks All that I have to say here to this Matter is that if  Jesus  had a Mind to raise the Son of this Widow in Testimony of his divine Power he should have suffer'd him to have been buried two or three Weeks first otherwise if the Mystery don't account for  Jesus  's stopping the Bearers of the Corpse upon the Road here is too much Room for suspicion of Cheat in the Letter of the Story  Lazarus  's Case seems to be the less exceptionable of the three He had been buried  four Days  and supposed to be putrified in the Opinion of his Sister  Mary  and of modern Christians And if so his Resuscitation was a most grand and indisputable Miracle And I could have wish'd if I had not loved the  Mystery  rather than the  Letter  that no Cavil and Exception could have been made to it Whether  Lazarus  who was  Jesus  's Friend and beloved Disciple would not come into Measures with his Lord for the Defence of his Honour and Propagation of his Fame  Infidels  who take Christianity for an Imposture will not question And whether he would not consent to be interr'd alive in a hollow Cave where there was only a Stone laid at the Mouth of it as long as  a Man could fast none of them will doubt Four Days was almost too long for a Man to fast without danger of Health but if those  four Days  are number'd according to the Arithmetick of Jesus'  s three Days  in his Grave they are reducible to two Days and three Nights which Time if no Victuals were secretly convey'd with him a Man might fast in  Lazarus  's Cave As to the  stinking  of  Lazarus  's Carcass that  Infidels  will say was but the Assertion of his Sister beforehand like a Prologue to a Farce None of the Spectators at his Resurrection say one Word of his stinking And as to the Weepings and Lamentations of  Jesus  and of  Lazarus  's Sisters they will say that was all Sham and Counterfeit the better to carry on the Juggle of a feign'd Resurrection And what's worst of all they will say that tho  Jesus  did call  Lazarus  forth with a  loud Voice  as if he had been as deaf as a dead Man yet his  Face was bound about with a Napkin  so that the Spectators could not discern what was of the Essence of the Miracle the Change of his Countenance from a dead to a live one which is a plain Sign that it was all Fraud and Imposture  God forbid that I should have the same sense with  Infidels  of this Matter but to be just to their Suggestions and Imaginations  here I must needs say there are some other unhappy Circumstances presently to be consider'd in this Story which if they are not emblematical make it the most notorious Cheat and Imposture that ever was put upon Mankind In the mean Time from what is here argued it is plain that  Lazarus  was not so long dead and buried as that there is no Room to doubt of the Miracle of his Resurrection  Now whether these Arguments against these three Miracles drawn from the Shortness of the Time in which these Persons lay for dead have any Force in them let our  Divines  consider If nothing of all this is in their Opinion affecting of the Credit of the Miracles yet they must allow that  Jesus  if he could raise the dead might have made Choice of other Instances of Persons more unquestionably dead who had lain longer in their Graves and were in a visible State of Putrefaction And if this grand Miracle of raising the dead was to be wrought by  Jesus  for the Manifestation of his Glory and in Testimony of his Authority he should have exercised his Power on some such Persons nominated by the Magistrates of this or that City who with the People should be present at the miraculous Operation beholding the putrified Bodies  without a Napkin before their Faces and how they were suddenly enliven'd and invigorated with new Flesh after the Similitude of their pristine Form when in Health and full Strength Because that  Jesus  rais'd not some such Persons to Life I must take the Stories of the three Miracles before us to be but typical of more mysterious Works or believe them for the Arguments above to be downright Cheats and Fables And what is enough to induce a modern  Divine  to this Opinion Is  The Consideration that none of these rais'd Persons did or could after the Return of their Souls to their Bodies tell any Tales of their separate Existence otherwise the Evangelists had not been silent in this main Point which is of the Essence of Christianity Are not our  Divines  here reduced to an unhappy  Dilemma  either to deny the separate Existence of the Soul or the precedent Deaths of these rais'd Persons As Christians we profess to believe both which seemingly are incompatiable or the Evangelists had made such a Relation as their return'd Souls had given of the other World Was any Person in this Age to be rais'd to Life that had been any time dead the first Thing  that his Friends and Acquaintance would enquire of him would be to know where his Soul had been in what Company and how it had fared with him and Historians would certainly record his Narrative The same Curiosity could not but possess People of old when these Miracles were wrought and if the rais'd Persons had told any Stories of their separate Existance the Evangelists no less unquestionally would have reported them in as much as such a Report would have been not only a Confirmation of that Doctrine which is of the Essence of our Religion but an absolute Confutation of the  Sadducees  and  Sceptists  of that Age and of the  Materialists  of this But this their Silence in this Case is of bad Consequence either to the Doctrine of the Soul's Existence in Separation from the Body or to these Miracles themselves since we must hereupon almost necessarily hold that these rais'd Persons were not at all dead or that their Souls dy'd with them  The Author of a Sermon ascrib'd to St  Augustin  tells us  Atque ut miraculum divinae Virtutis accresceret dum Convivis interrogantibus tristia Loca paenarum sedes{que} alta nocte semper obscuras Lazarus indicat diligenti narratione per ordinem Diu quaesiti longis{que} temporibus ignorati invenerunt tandem Inferi Prod  m  In Serm  cxvi  Append St August  that  Lazarus  after  his Resurrection made a large Report of  Hell  where he had been But as this is a mere Fiction of that Author without the least Authority from Scripture so I presume it will be accounted a  Blunder  in him to suppose the Soul of  Lazarus  the Friend and beloved of  Jesus  was in Hell The Soul of  Jesus  indeed for Reasons best known to himself upon his Death descended into Hell when some think he should rather have gone with the penitent Thief into Paradise But the Thoughts that any of  Jesus  's Friends should go to Hell I suppose will not be born with or what will become of the Preachers of this Age who would be accounted Men of that Denomination And if  Lazarus  's Soul had been in Paradise it was hardly a good Work in  Jesus  to recall it for thirty Years afterwards to the Miseries and Troubles of this wicked World I wish therefore our  Divines  could determine where  Lazarus  's Soul was for the four Days of his Burial because I can't possibly conceive any thing else than that he was not really dead or that his Soul dy'd with him or went to a bad place otherwise after his Resurrection he had never  absconded for fear of the  Jews  as if he was unwilling to die again and return to the Place from whence he came  But however it was with the Souls of these rais'd Persons before their Reunion to their Bodies here is another Difficulty and Objection against these Miracles and how will our  Divines  get over it Perhaps they may say that tho' these rais'd Persons were before really dead yet their Souls were not as yet gone to their Places prepared of God for them but continued hovering about their Bodies like the Flame about the Snuff of a Candle with desires  iterum{que} reverti  Corpora  to be again rejoin'd to them And withall my Heart let this Answer pass if our  Divines  and  Infidels  can so agree upon it As for my own Opinion it is this that these Miracles of  Jesus  are Parables and that it was beside the Purpose of the Parable and of the  Evangelists  to say any thing of the Place and State of the Soul upon its Separation from the Body otherwise the Letter of their Stories is manifestly obnoxious to the Objection above or the Deaths of these pretended rais'd Persons upon Christian Principles are questionable But  And lastly Let us consider the intrinsick Absurdities and Incredibilities of the several Stories of these three Miracles And such Absurdities shall we find in them that if they had been intended as Testimonies of  Jesus  's divine Power had never been inserted in their Narratives  As to  Jairus  's Daughter and her Resurrection from the dead St  Hilary  Princeps hic Lex esse intelligitur quae Dominum orat pro Plebe quam ipsa Christo praedicata ejus Adventus Expectatione nutriverat ut Vi tam mortuae reddat Nam nullum Principem credidisse legimus ex quo Persona hujus principis orantis merito in Typum aptabitur  In Loc Matt  hints that there was no such Person as  Jairus  whose Name was fictitious and coin'd with a spiritual Signification for the Use of the Parable and he gives this Reason and a good Reason it is why he thought so because it is elsewhere  John vii and xii  intimated in the Gospel that none of the Rulers of the Synagogues confessedly believed on  Jesus  Is not here then a stumblingBlock at the Threshold of the Letter of this Story But why did  Jesus  say this Girl was but in a Sleep If he was going to work a Miracle in her Resuscitation he should not have call'd Death  Sleep  but if others had been of a contrary Opinion he should first have convinced them of the Certainty of her Death before he did the great Work on her And why did he charge the Parents of the Girl not to speak of the Miracle If he meant it as a Testimony of his divine Power he should rather have exhorted them in justice to himself to publish it and make it well known And why as St  Ambrose  Quae tamen tantae diversitatis Causa Supra publice Viduoe filius suscitatur hic removentur plures arbitri  In Loc Luc  puts the Question did he turn the People out of the House before he would raise her The more Witnesses are present at a Miracle the better it is attested and the more readily believed by others and who should be present at the Miracle rather than those who were incredulous of  Jesus  's divine Power Are not all these Circumstances so many  Absurdities  which if they are not to be accounted for in the  Mystery  are so far destructive of the  Letter  as that it is Nonsense and Folly in our  Divines  to talk of a Miracle here against  Jesus  's express Word and Prohibition to the contrary  As to the Story of the Widow of  Naim  's Son excepting what is before observed of  the shortness of the Time in which he lay dead and of the Unfitness of his Person to be rais'd before an Husband and Father of a Family to the Comfort of his Wife and Children which are enough to overthrow the Credility of the Miracle I have here no more Fault to find in the Letter of it  But the long Story of  Lazarus  is so brimful of Absurdities that if the Letter alone is to be regarded St  John  who was then above a hundred when he wrote it had lived beyond his Reason and Senses or he could not have committed them  I have not Room here to make Remarks on all these Absurdities which would be the Work of a Volume but shall single out three or four of them at present reserving the rest for another Opportunity when the whole Story of this Miracle will appear to be such a Contexture of Folly and Fraud in its Contrivance Execution and Relation as is not to be equall'd in all Romantick History and our  Divines  will find themselves so distress'd upon the Dissection and Display of it as that they must of Necessity allow this Story to be but a Parable or what's most grievous to think on give up their Religion upon it  First  then observe that  Jesus  is said to have  wept  and  groan'd  for the Death of  Lazarus  But why so says  Qua igitur Ratione qui tanta haec erat facturus  quod evenit judicasset merito Lacrymis esse prosequendum  In Homil de Cratiarum Actione  St  Basil  Was not this an  Absurdity  to weep at all for the Death of him whom he could and was about to recover to Life again Another Man may as reasonably grieve for the Absence of his Friend whose Company and Presence he can retrieve in an Instant as that  Jesus  should shed Tears for  Lazarus  in this Case If  Jesus  could not or would not raise him from the dead he ought not as a Philosopher who knows Man is born to die to betray so much Weakness as to weep for him Patience and Resignation unto God upon the Death of our dearest Friends and Relations is what all Philosophers have rightly taught and  Jesus  one would think should have been the most Heroical Example of these Graces and how came he to fail of it here A Stoical Apathy had better became him than such childish and effeminate Grief which not only makes him a mean and poorspirited Mortal but is a gross  Absurdity  and  Incredibility  upon Consideration of his Will and Power to fetch  Lazarus  to Life again If there be not according to the Fathers Mystery in these Tears of  Jesus  they are a foolish and unnatural Prelude to a Farce he was acting in the pretended Resuscitation of  Lazarus  Some antient Catholicks not being apprised of the Mystery were so offended at these Words  Jesus wept  that as  Epiphanius  Lacrymatus est Jesus  quod aliquando erasum fuisse a Catholicis quibusdam scribit Epiphanius Vid  Drusium in Loc Johan  says they expung'd them out of their Bibles and I wonder they have not before now disturb'd the Faith of Ministers of the Letter to the utter Rejection of the Miracle  Secondly  Observe that  John  says it was with  a loud Voice  that  Jesus  call'd  Lazarus  forth out of his Cave And why I pray a louder Voice than ordinary Was dead  Lazarus  deafer than  Jairus  's Daughter or the Widow's Son Or was his Soul at so great a Distance from his Body as he could not hear a still and low Voice Some such silly Reason as  this  must be given for this  loud Voice  here but how absurd it is according to the Letter Infidels will judge till Christians can assign a better The dead can hear the Whisper of the Almighty if Power go along with it  as soon as the Sound of a Trumpet St  John  then should not have written of a  loud Voice  unless he meant to adapt his Story to the Capacities and Conceptions of the Vulgar who have no Apprehensions of God's Power out of sensible and human Representations of it  Thirdly  Because that a Miracle should be well guarded against all Suspicion of Fraud I was thinking to make it an  Absurdity  that the Napkin before  Jesus  rais'd  Lazarus  was not taken from his Face that the Spectators might behold his mortified Looks and the miraculous Change of his Countenance from Death unto Life What  Infidels  think of this Circumstance I know not I hope it is not with them a Token of Fraud and Imposture tho I must needs say that if the Fathers did not let me into the Mystery of the Napkin about  Lazarus  's Face when  Jesus  call'd him forth I should not my self like it  Fourthly  and lastly Observe St  John  says v that  many of the Jews who had seen the Things that Jesus did  here  believed on him  and  some of them  v who did not believe  went their Ways to the Pharisees and told them what Things Jesus had done  in this pretended Miracle  and how the Business was transacted Whereupon the Chief Priests and Pharisees were so far incens'd as v  from that Day forth they took Council together to put him to Death  and Ch xii  consulted that they might put  Lazarus  also to Death  Jesus  therefore  and his Disciples and  Lazarus  fled for it for they v  walk'd no more openly among the Jews  but  went thence into a Country near to the Wilderness  a convenient hiding Place  and there continued with his Disciples  otherwise in all Probability they had been all sacrificed  I dare not argue upon these Circumstances neither would I for the Honour of  Jesus  have mention'd them but that my old Friend the Jewish  Rabbi  who help'd me to the Satirical Invective against  Jesus  's Miracle of  turning Water into Wine  has hence form'd an Objection against  Lazarus  's Resurrection and sent me a  Letter  upon it desiring me to publish it and exhort the  Clergy  to answer it otherwise he would clandestinely hand it about to the Prejudice of our Religion Whereupon I rather than Christianity should so suffer do here publish it and it is as follows  Sr  When we last discours'd on  Jesus  's Miracles I promised to send you my Thoughts on  Lazarus  's Resurrection which I look upon as a notorious Imposture  and for the Proof of it need go no farther than to the Circumstances of its Story which your  Evangelist  has related  If there had been an indisputable Miracle wrought in  Lazarus  's Resurrection why were the  ChiefPriests  and  Pharisees  so incens'd upon it as  to take Council to put both Jesus  and  Lazarus  to  Death for it  Where was the Provocation I can conceive none Tho' the  Jews  were ever so canker'd with Malice and Hatred to  Jesus  before yet such a most stupendous Miracle was enough to stop their Mouths and turn their Hearts Or if their Prejudices against  Jesus  were insuperable and they hated him but the more for the Number and Greatness of his Miracles yet why is poor  Lazarus  inoffensive  Lazarus  upon whom this good and great Work was wrought an Object of their Hatred too Your  Divines  are to give a credible and probable Account of this Matter such a one as will comport with Reason and Sense or we shall conclude that it was  Fraud  detected in this pretended Miracle which justly provok'd the Indignation of our Ancestors  To say what is all you can say that it was downright inhumanity Barbarity and Brutality in the  Jews  to hate  Lazarus  as well as  Jesus  will not do here Tho' this may pass with many Christians who are ready to swallow without chewing any evil Reports of our Nation yet it can't go down with reasonable and unprejudic'd Men who must have other Conceptions of human Nature in all Ages and Nations than to think it possible that a Man in  Lazarus  's Case can be hated and persecuted for having had such a good and wonderful Work done on him And why then was he hated and persecuted I say for this and no other Reason than because he was a Confederate with  Jesus  in the wicked Imposture he was putting upon Mankind  But supposing what is never to be granted that the  Jews  of old were so inhuman brutish and barbarous as to hate and persecute  Lazarus  as well as  Jesus  for this Miracle yet why did  Jesus  and his Disciples with  Lazarus  run away and abscond upon it for they v  walk'd no more openly among the  Jews  but went thence into a Country near to the Wilderness and there  Jesus  continued with his Disciples  Is not here a plain Sign of Guilt and of Fraud Men that have God's Cause Truth and Power on their Side never want Courage and Resolution  to stand to it And however your Christian  Priests  may palliate the cowardly and timerous Conduct of  Jesus  and his Confederates in this Case yet with me it's like Demonstration that there was a discover'd Cheat in the Miracle or they would undauntedly have faced their Enemies without Fears And Apprehensions of Danger from them  Our Ancestors then who unquestionably detected the Fraud were in the right on't to prosecute with Severity the whole Party concern'd in it And if they had aveng'd the Wickedness of it upon  Lazarus  as well as they did upon  Jesus  I should have commended them for it Whether such a monstrous Imposture as was this pretended Miracle happily discover'd does not call aloud for Vengeance and most exemplary Punishment and whether any Nation of the World would suffer the like with Impunity let any Man judge  For all the Reports of your Gospels it is unnatural to hate a miraculous Healer of Diseases and there must be somewhat supprest about the Inveteracy of the  Jews  to  Jesus  or his healing Power if it was so great as is imagined must have reconciled them to him But that they should hate not only  Jesus  for  raising the dead but the Person rais'd by him is improbable incredible and impossible  If Historians can parrallel this Story of the Malignity of the  Jews  towards  Jesus  and  Lazarus  upon such a real Miracle with any Thing equally barbarous and inhuman in any other Sect or Nation we will acknowledge the Truth of it against our ancient Nation Or if such Inhumanity abstractedly consider'd be at all agreeable to the Conceptions any one can form of Human Nature in the most uncivilis'd and brutish People we will allow our Ancestors in this Case to have been that People  Was such a real and indisputable Miracle as this of  Lazarus  is supposed to be wrought at this day in Confirmation of Christianity I dare say it would bring all us  Jews  to a Man into the Belief of it And I don't think it possible for any People to be so begotten byass'd and prejudiced as not to be wrought on by it Or if they would not part with their Interests and Prejudices upon it they would have more Wit and Temper than to break forth into a Rage against all or any of the Persons concern'd in it And for my Life I can entertain no worse Thoughts of our old Nation  Supposing God should send an Ambassador at this day who to convince Christians of the Mischiefs and Inconvenience of an  Hireling Priesthood  should work such a Miracle as was this of  Lazarus  's Resurrection in the Presence of a multitude of Spectators how would your  Bishops  and  Clergy  behave themselves upon it Why they would be as mute as Fishes or if they did fret and grieve inwardly for the Loss of their Interests yet they would have more Prudence ask them else than to show their Anger openly and persecute both  Agent  and  Patient  for it Wherefore then are they so censorious and uncharitable as to preach and believe another Notion and Doctrine of our Ancestors  But if a false Prophet for the subversion of an  Hireling Priesthood  should in spite to the  Clergy  counterfeit such a Miracle and be detected in the Operation how then would Priests and People Magistrates and Subjects behave upon it Why they would be full of Indignation and  from that day forth would take Council to put  the Impostor and his Confederate to Death of which they would be most deserving and if they did not abscond and fly for it like  Jesus  and his Disciples  to a Wilderness in the Country  to hide themselves the Rage of the Populace would hardly wait the Leisure of Justice to dispatch and make terrible Examples of them Was not this exactly the Case of  Jesus  's Imposture in the Resurrection of  Lazarus  and of the Punishment he was threaten'd with and afterwards most justly underwent for it  Mankind may be in some Cases very obdurate and so hard of Belief as to stand it out against Sense Reason and Demonstration But I will not think worse of our Ancestors than of the rest of Mankind or that they any more than others would have withstood a clear and indisputable Miracle in  Lazarus  's Resuscitation Such a manifest Miracle let it be wrought for what End and Purpose we can possibly imagine would strike Men with Awe and Reverence and none could hate and persecute the Author of the Miracle least He who could raise the dead should exert his Power against themselves and either wound or sinite them dead with it For which Reason the Resurrection of  Lazarus  on the certain Knowledge of our Ancestors was all Fraud or they would have reverenc'd and adored the Power of him that did it  It may be true what  John  says that  many of the Jews who had seen the Things that Jesus did believed on him  that is believed that he had wrought here a great Miraale But who were these the ignorant and credulous whom a much less  juggler  than Mr  Fawkes  could easily impos'd on But on the other hand it is certain according to  Christian Commentators  that  some of them  did not believe the Miracle but  went their ways to the Pharisees and told them what Things Jesus had done  that is told them after what manner the Intrigue was managed and complain'd of the Fraud in it How they came to suspect and discover the Fraud was not  John  ' Business to relate and for want  other ancient Memorials we can only guess at it Perhaps they discern'd some motion in  Lazarus  s Body before the Word of Command to  come forth  was given perhaps they discover'd some Fragments of the Food that for  four days  in the Cave he had subsisted on But however this was they could not but take Notice of the  Napkin about his Face  all the while which  Jesus  to prevent all suspicion of Cheat should have first order'd to be taken off that his mortify'd Countenance might be view'd  before the miraculous Change of it to Life was wrought This neglect in  Jesus  which I wonder  John  had no more Wit than to hint at will be a lasting Objection to the Miracle  Jesus  was wiser than not to be aware of the Objection which he would have obviated if he durst by a Removal of the Napkin to the satisfaction of all Spectators there present Because this was not done we  Jews  now deny there was any Miracle wrought and whether our Unbelief upon this Circumstance be not well grounded we appeal to Christian Priests themselves who must own that if there was a Miracle here the Matter was ill conducted by  Jesus  or foolishly related by his  Evangelist  It is a sad Misfortune that attends our modern enquiry after Truth that there are no other Memorials extant of the Life and Miracles of  Jesus  than what are written by his own Disciples Not only old Time has devour'd but Christians themselves which in the Opinion of the impartial makes for us when they got Power into their Hands wilfully destroy'd many Writings of our Ancestors as well as of  Celsus  and  Porphiry  and others which they could not answer  otherwise I doubt not but they would have given us clear Light into the Imposture of  Lazarus  's Resurrection But if  Jesus  according to his own  Evangelists  was arraign'd for a  Deceiver  and  Blasphemer  in pretending to the Sonship and Power of God by his Miracles in all Probability this Piece of Fraud in  Lazarus  was one Article of the Indictment against him and what makes it very likely is that the  Chief Priests  and  Pharisees  from the Date of this pretended Miracle  took Council together to put him to Death  not clandestinely or tumultuously to murder him but judicially to punish him with Death which if they proved their Indictment by credible and sufficient Witnesses he was most worthy of  As it is plain from the Story in  John  that there was a Dispute among the Bystanders at  Lazarus  's Resurrection whether it was a real Miracle or not so it is the Opinion of us  Jews  which is of the Nature of a Tradition that the  ChiefPriests  and civil Magistrates of  Bethany  for the better Determination of the Dispute and quieting of the Minds of the People requir'd that  Jesus  should react the Miracle upon another Person there lately dead and buried But  Jesus  declining this Test of his Power the whole Multitude of Believers as well as of Unbelievers before question'd the Resurrection of  Lazarus  and were highly incens'd against both him and  Jesus  for the Deceit in it And this was  one  Reason among others of that vehement and universal Outcry and Demand at  Jesus  's Tryal for his Crucifixion I'll not answer for the Certainty of this Tradition or Opinion but as the Expedient was obvious so it has the Face of Truth and Credibility and for the Proof of it I need only appeal to Christain  Priests  and  Magistrates  whether under a Dispute of a Miracle of that Consequence they would not require for full Satisfaction it should be acted over again and if the  Juggler  refused whether there would not be a general Clamour of People of all Ranks for his  Execution  Matthev    Mark  and  Luke  who knew as much of this Sham Miracle as  John  had not the Confidence to report it because when they wrote many EyeWitnesses of the Fraud were alive to disprove and contradict them therefore they confined their Narratives to  Jesus  's less juggling Tricks that had pass'd more current But after the  Jewish  State  was dissolved their judicial Records were destroy'd and every Body dead that could confute him  John  ventures abroad the Story of this Miracle and if the good Providence of God had not infatuated him in the Insertion of the Circumstances here observed it might have pass'd through all Generations to come as well as it has done for many past for a grand Miracle  Thus  Sir  have you a few of my Thoughts on the pretended Miracle of  Lazarus  's Resurrection I have more to bestow on it but that I would not be tedious There's no need to argue against the other two ResurrectionStories You know  omne majus includit minus  and if the greatest of the three Miracles be an Imposture the two less ones of Consequence are Artifice and Fraud And rather than the Miracle of  Lazarus  shall stand its Ground I'll have t'other Bout at it from some other Circumstances the Consideration of which will make it as foolish and wicked an Imposture as ever was contrived and transacted in the World such a  wicked Imposture  of most pernicious Consequence to the Welfare of the Publick that it is no Wonder the People by an unanimous Voice call'd for the Releasement  of  Barabbas  a Robber and Murderer before  Jesus  I don't suppose these Arguments against this Miracle will be convincing of your Christian  Clergy  who are hired to the Belief of it But however a  Bishop  of many  thousands  a Year to believe can't in Conscience deny that the Arguments above are a sufficient Justification of our  Jewish  Disbelief of it  If you Sir should write a Discourse gainst the Letter of the Story of  Jesus  's Resurrection I beg of you to accept of a few of my Conceptions on that Head which I promise you shall be out of the common Road of thinking Your  Divines  think they have exhausted that Subject and absolutely confuted all Objections that can be made against it but are much mistaken Sometimes we  Jews  dip into their Writings on this Head and always smile with Indignation at their foolish Invectives against the Blindness of the Eyes and Hardness of the Hearts of our Ancestors If they would but favour us with a Liberty to write for our selves a reasonable Liberty which in this Philosophical Age we don't despair of especially under so wise just and good a Civil Administration as this Nation is happily bless'd with we  would cut them out some more Work which they are not aware of In the mean Time I am your assured Friend  N N  So ends the Letter of my Friend the  Jewish Rabbi  which consists of  calm  and  sedate  Reasoning or I would not have publish'd it for I am resolv'd he shall no more impose upon me with his ludicrous and bantering Stuff like his Satirical Invective against  Jesus  's Miracle of  turning Water into Wine  so offensive to our Godly  Bishops  And because it consists of  calm  and  sedate  Reasoning which  Bishop Smalbroke  allows of I hope his  Lordship  will take it into Consideration and write an Answer to it which I without the Help of the Mystery can't do  If the foresaid  Letter  be offensive to our  Clergy  who don't judge it meet that the  Jews  should take this Liberty to write against the Miracles of our Saviour and in Vindication of their own disbelief of Christianity I beg of them for the Love of  Jesus  not to let their Displeasure be visibly seen because the  Jews  will then laugh in their Sleeves and perhaps openly insult and triumph upon it But if they will privately acquaint me with their Displeasure  at it I'll promise them to hold no more Correspondence with such  Jewish Rabbies  neither will I ever hereafter publish any other Objections against  Christ  's Religion and Miracles than what come from the  Hotentots  and  Pawawers  and then it will be strange if our dignified  Clergy  of most grave and demure Looks can't solidly confute the worst that such ignorant and illiterate People can urge against them  And thus have I done with my Objections against the Letter of these three Miracles If our  Divines  shall think there is little or nothing of Force in them then an Answer which I should be glad to see may the more easily be made to them As for my part without being conceited of the Acuteness and Strength of any of the Objections I think it impossible satisfactorily to reply to them without having Recourse to the Opinions of the Fathers that these three Miracles whether they were ever litterally transacted or not are now but emblematical Representations of mysterious and more wonderful Operations to be perform'd by  Jesus  To the Fathers then let us go for their mystical Interpretation of these Miracles St  Augustin  in his Introduction to a Sermon on the Widow of  Naim  's Son says  Quidam corporalia ejus Miracula stupentes majora intueri non norunt Quidam vero ea quae gesta audiunt in Corporibus nunc amplius in Animis admiranturDominus enim noster Jesus Christus ea quae faciebat corporaliter etiam spiritaliter volebat intelligi neque enim Miracula propter Miracula faciebat sed ut illa quae faciebat mira essent Videntibus vera essent IntelligentibusAlii facta mirati intellecta assecuti Tales nos esse debemus in Schola ChristiHoc dixi de ficu arefacta ut persuaderem Dominum Jesum Christum ideo Miracula fecisse ut aliquid illis Miraculis significaret ut excepto eo quod mira magna divina erant aliquid inde etiam disceremus Videamus ergo quid nos discere voluit in tribus mortuis quos suscitavit  In Serm  xcviii  thus "There are some so silly as to stand amazed at the corporal Miracles of  Jesus  and have no Consideration of his greater and spiritual Miracles signified by them but others who are wiser can hear of the Things that  Jesus  did on Men's Bodys without being astonish'd at them chusing rather to contemplate with Admiration his more wonderful Works on Men's Souls after the similitude of bodily Miracles And these are the Christians that conform their Studies to the Will of our Lord who would have his corporal Miracles spiritually interpreted For He wrought not Micles in the Flesh for the sake of such Miracles abstractedly consider'd but  that if they were surprising to some Mens Senses they should be more astonishing to the Understanding of others who apprehend the spiritual Meaning of them And they who by Contemplation can attain to the mystical Signification of  Jesus  's Miracles are the best Scholars and most learn'd Disciples in his Church and School And  speaking of the Absurdity of Jesus's cursing the Figtree according to the Letter  presently after says that this he observ'd that he might persuade his Hearers to think that our Lord  Jesus  therefore wrought Miracles that he might signify somewhat by them which he would have his Disciples to learn and consider of Come now  says he  and let us see what we are mistically and spiritually to understand by the Stories of the three Persons rais'd from the dead"  There are two Ways that the Fathers took in the moral and mystical Interpretation of these Miracles One was from the Number  three  and their Difference in Magnitude According to which they said with St  Augustin  Ista tria Genera Mortuorum sunt tria Genera  rum quos hodie suscitat ChristusSunt ergo instar filiae Synagogae Principis qui peccatum intus in Corde babent in facto nondum habent Condemnatur Consensus ad Iniquitatem respiratur ad Salutem at{que} Justitiam Surgit mortuus in Domo reviviscit Cor in Cogitationis Secreto Facta est ista Resurrectio Animae mortuae intus intra Latebras Conscientiae tanquam intra Domesticos ParietesAlii post Consensum eunt in factum tanquam efferentes mortuum ut quod latebat in Secreto appareat in publico Nonne illi juveni dictam est  Tibi dico    surge  redditus est Matri sic qui jam fecerit si forte admonitus commotus Verbo Veritatis ad Christi Vocem resurgit vivus redditur EcclesiaeQui autem faciendo quod malum est etiam mala Consuetudine se implicant tales Consuetudine maligna pressi tanquam sepulti ita sepulti ut de Lazaro dictum est jam  putet  In Serm xcviii  that these three  sorts of dead Persons so rais'd to Life are Figures of three sorts of Sinners whom  Jesus  raiseth from the death of Sin to the Life of Righteousness They who have conceiv'd Sin in their Hearts and have not brought it forth into Act are figured by  Jairus  's Daughter who lay dead in the House of her Father and was not taken forth to her Burial Others who after Cogitation and Consent pass into actual Sin are figured by the Young Man carried towards his Grave But those Sinners who are habituated and long accustom'd to Sin are like  Lazarus  bury'd and in a stinking Condition under the Corruption  of it whom  Jesus  for all that with the  loud Voice  of the Praedication of his Gospel will call forth out of the Death and Grave of their Sins to a new Life So does St  Augustin  make these three dead Persons and their Resurrections Emblems of the said three Sorts of Sinners who are dead in Trespasses and Sins and by the Power of  Jesus  quicken'd to a Life of Righteousness And to this Opinion of St  Augustin  do St  Ambrose    Eusebius Gallicanus  and Venerable  Bede  agree And according to this Notion of these Miracles they descend to a particular Explication of the several Parts of their Stories As to give you two or three Instances  The People who were turn'd out of the House upon the raising of  Jarius  's Daughter which is an  Absurdity  according to the  Letter  are says  Cum ejecta esset Turba    intravit  Moraliter non  esurgit Anima quae intrinsecus jacet mortua nisi prius a secretioribus Cordis excludatur inopportuna saecularium Cogitationum Multitudo  In Loc Matt  Bede  a Multitude of wordly and wicked Thoughts which except they are excluded from the Secrets of the Heart are a Hindrance of the Resurrection of a Sinner to a new Life  The Bearers of the Young Man  Mali isti Portitores qui ad sepeliendum hominem ferunt sunt Vitia maligni spiritus Haeretici seductores Hos enim nisi Dominus sisteret quoscun{que} semel acciperent sepulturae aeternae Damnationi traderent Suscitatus igitur Adolescens sedet loquitur Matri redditur quia ad Penitentiam conversus in Ecclesiae pace quiescit Dei Magnalia loquitur sua peccata confitetur Ecclesiae reconciliatur  Euseb Gallic in Homil Feriae quintae post Domin    tam  to his Burial are Vices evil Spirits Haereticks and Seducers and the  Widow  his Mother to whom he was restored is the  Church  who mourns for the Death of such Sinners as are typified by that Young Man  Jesus  's  weeping  for dead  Lazarus  which is an  Absurdity  according to the  Letter  is a Sign  Et  lacrymatus est Jesus  Lacrymemur igitur nos pro omnibus illis quos in Faetore Vitiorum jacere  entimus  Euseb Gallic in Homil Feriae    tae post Domin    tam  of the deplorable State that habitual Sinners are in enough to excite the Sorrows and Mournings of good Christians who have the Spirit of  Christ  for them And the Stone that lay at the Grave of  Lazarus  is  Lapis autem revolutus a Monumento significat Infidelitatis Duritiam ab Hominum Corde submotam  Theop Antioch in Loc Johan  a figure of the Hardness of the Heart of such a Sinner  which must be taken away before  Jesus  will call him to a new Life So do the Fathers moralise and allegorise every Minute Circumstance of these three Miracles as any one who will consult them may find and save me the Trouble of a tedious Recital of their Authorities  But the other mystical Way of interpreting these three Miracles is by making them Types of three great Events at the Time of  Christ  's spiritual Advent Accordingly the raising of  Jairus  's Daughter is a Type of the Conversion of the  Jews  at that Day as  Eusebius Gallicanus  Quod enim tunc temporis factum est in una Puella hoc in fine Temporum futurum est ut fiat in tota Sonagoga  In Homil Feriae    ta post Domin    tam  and venerable  Bede  Synagoga circa finem saeculi erit restituta saluti  In Loc Matt  and others expound it By  Jairus  the Ruler of a  Synagogue  is meant  Moses  Jairus illuminatus vel illuminans Moses intelligitur  Bed  in  Loc Mat  and by his Daughter is to be understood the  Jewish Church  which being at present in a State of Spiritual Death will be revived and converted in the Perfection of Time And to the mystical Resurrection or Restitution of the  Jewish Synagogue  call'd  Jairus  's  Daughter will  Jesus  come  Ad hanc ergo Principis filiam dum properat Dei Verbum ut salvos faceret filios Israel sancta Ecclesia de Gentibus congregata quae inferiorum Lapsu Criminum deperibat paratam aliis fide praeripuit Sanitatem  St Ambros in Loc Luc  Quod vero post restitutam immundae Mulieri Valetudinem defuncta Puella a mortuis restituitur ne hoc quidem ab exquisita Allegoria alienum Nam Reliquiae salvae fiant juxta Apostolum cum ingressa fuerit Gentium Plenitudo  Theop Ceram in Homil de Jairi filia  at the same Time he heals the Woman of the Church of her Issue of Blood And this is the Reason that the Stories of these two Miracles are blended together by the  Evangelists  with their synchronical Numbers of the Age of the  Girl  and of the Disease of the Woman because they are Types of that blessed Scene of Affairs at the Conversion of the  Jews  when the Fulness of the  Gentiles  is come in Concerning which blessed state of the Church  Origen  Quarum Rerum Causa multa fuere Jesu Miracula  In Johan Cap XI  says  Jesus  wrought many Miracles by Way of Type and Figure  Among all the Miracles that  Jesus  wrought and are recorded by the  Evangelists  I think as far as I have had Occasion to observe the Fathers are most scanty in their Interpretations of that of the  Widow of  Naim  's Son Excepting what is before noted of his being a figure of a Sinner dead in actual tho not habitual Sin I find very little But if  Origen  's Comments on this Miracle had been extant I dare say he would have given us this following Interpretation of it This Widow he would have call'd the Church and her  only Son  or masculine Offspring he would have call'd the  Spiritual Sense  of the Scriptures which is now dead and that the  Ministers  of the  Letter  who are his Bearers are for interring him within the  Earth  of the  Letter  But  Jesus  upon his Spiritual Advent will put a stop to the Intention of such Bearers by reviving the  Spiritual Sense  of the Scriptures and by restoring it like a  quicken'd Son  to the Comfort of his Mother the Church who has been in a sorrowful and lamentable Condition upon the Death and Want of it This I am sure would be  Origen  's Interpretation of this Miracle which if I had Room here by a little Circumlocution I could prove  As to  Lazarus  's Resurrection it is in the Opinion of the Fathers  Per Lazarum Genus humanum ostenditur  Theop Antioch in Loc Johan  Nostra Resurrectio figuratur per Lazari ResurrectionemSpelunca sive Sepulchrum Lazari Litteram Legis umbratilem designat  Magna Voce clamavit Jesus  id  Praedicatio Evangelii per quam humana Natura Peccatorum Vinculis in Scpulchro Infidelitatis jacens vocatur ad Vitam  Theop Ceram in Homil de Lazaro  a Type of the  general and mystical Resurrection of Mankind in the Perfection of Time But this is a most copious Subject and unless I could here throughly handle it I had much better say nothing  And thus have I done with the three Resurrection Stories If the  Convocation  next Session would determine by an Orthodox Vote whether  Jesus  rais'd any more than the said three Persons from the dead or not I would present them with a new and more entertaining Chain of Thoughts against these Miracles such a Chain of Thoughts as upon the Conclusion let them hold which Side of the Question they please will necessarily induce us to hold the mystical Meaning of these Miracles or to grant that  Jesus  rais'd none from the dead at all  My next and last  Discourse  on  Jesus  's Miracles shall be against the Letter of the Story of his own Resurrection in which if our  Bishops  will keep their Temper and Patience till I publish it I'll cut out such a Piece of Work for our  Boylean  Lectures  as shall hold them tug so long as the  Ministry  of the  Letter  and an  Hireling Priesthood  shall last If  Christ be not risen  then according to the Inference of St  Paul    is their Preaching vain  and why should the People be any longer charg'd with the Maintenance of an ignorant and idle Order of Men to no Use and Purpose  If I had not had Experience of it I could never have believed that for all the ludicrous Nature of these  Discourses  our  dignified Clergy  could have been so foolish or malicious as to prosecute me for an  Infidel  and  Blasphemer  upon them How a Man may be mistaken in himself I took my self for a real Advocate for the Truth of Christianity and was so vain as to imagine these Discourses tended to a Demonstration of  Jesus  's Messiahship And tho the  Bishop  of  London  may be of a contrary Opinion yet I am still so conceited of my Ability to defend our Religion that I'll stake my Life against his  Bishoprick  which I'll not be troubled with if I win it that he can't form an Objection against Christianity which I can't solidly confute and make our Readers merry too with his Weakness and Impertinence in it But perhaps it may be unbecoming of his Lordship's Character and against the  Grain to make an Objection to that Religion which he finds much  temporal  as well as some  spiritual  Comfort in the Profession of I will therefore descend to another Proposal  viz  If he'll but publish an Answer to the  Jewish Rabbi  's Letter in this Discourse and vouchsafe me the pleasure of a Reply to him then to save the Civil Magistrate's Trouble I will suffer any Punishment that in his Clemency he shall think fit to inflict on me for what's past Oh what a Hazard do I here run of Life or Liberty  Some Christians in my Case would think it a sad Misfortune to be odiously represented as an  Infidel  and  Blasphemer  but I in Temper and Principle despise such Obloquies Slanders and Defamations and would not give a Rush to remove them so long as I had the Answer of a good Conscience that I was undeserving of them But considering that it is the Duty of a Christian to seek the Peace and Friendship of all about him and especially of our good  Bishops  who in Compassion to the Danger they think my Soul is in have taken zealous and laudable Pains with the  Civil Magistrate  for my Conviction and Conversion I do here for the sake of a Reconciliation with their  Lordships  and other good People make a formal  and solemn Confession of my Christian Faith which tho' I don't express in the Words of the  Apostical    Nicene  or  Athanasian  Creeds yet will do it in such Terms as will be a Demonstration that at the Bottom I am sound as a  Roch  Be it known then to all Christian People that  Imprimis  I believe upon the Authority of the Fathers that the Ministry of the Letter of the  Old  and  New  Testament is downright  Antichristianism  Item  I believe upon the Authority of the Fathers that the Miracles of  Jesus  as they are recorded by the Evangelists  litterally  understood are the  lying Wonders  of Antichrist  Item  I believe upon the Authority of the Fathers that all opposition and Contradiction to spiritual and allegorical Interpretations of the Scripture is the Sin of  Blasphemy  against the Holy Ghost  Item  I believe upon the Authority of the Fathers that the  Ministry  of the  Spirits  or allegorical Interpretations of the Law and the Prophets will be the Conversion of  Jews  and  Gentiles  Item  I believe upon the Authority of the Fathers that the  Ministry  of the  Letter  and an HirelingPriesthood have been the Cause of the Infidelity and Apostacy of these latter Times  Item  I believe upon the Authority of the Fathers that the Spirit and Power of  Jesus  will soon enter the Church and expel HirelingPriests who make Merchandise of the Gospel out of her after the manner he is suppos'd to have driven the  Buyers  and  Sellers  out of the Temple  These are a few Articles of that Faith once deliver'd to the  Saints  of the primitive Church which I firmly believe and will earnestly contend for Now I appeal to the Christian World whether a Man of such a Faith like Heart of Oak can be an Infidel or Blasphemer Upon this ingenuous Confession of my Faith which I make by way of Atonement for my past supposed Errors and Offences I hope the  Bishops  and all good Christian People will be reconciled to me  St  Jame's  says that  Faith without Works is dead  and how a Man ought to how his Faith by his Works without  which Faith is an empty and airy Nothing Accordingly I am making what haste I can to show the Sincerity of my Faith by these my  Works  and  Discourses  of this Kind And by the Grace of God I hope our Bishops will find me as unmoveable as a Rock in the said Faith  According to the foresaid Articles of this my Faith I am so fully convinced not only of the Error of the  Ministry  of the  Letter  but of the Mischiefs and Inconveniences of an  HirelingPriesthood  that having set my Shoulders to the Work I am resolv'd by the Help of God to endeavour to give  both  a Lift out of this World This is fair and generous Warning to our  Clergy  to sit fast and look to their own Safety or they may find me a stronger Man than they may be aware of And tho I don't expect long to survive the Accomplishment of so great and glorious a Work yet I am delightfully ravish'd and transported with the Forethought and Contemplation of the Happiness of Mankind upon the Extinction of Ecclesiastical  Vermin  out of God's House when the World will return to its  Primogenial  and  Paradisaical  State of Nature Religion and Liberty in which we shall be  all taught of God  and  have no need  of foolish and contentious Priest hired to harangue  us with his Noise and Nonsense Which blessed State of the World God of his infinite Mercy hasten for the sake of our Spiritual Messiah Mediator and Redeemer  Jesus Christ  To whom be Glory for ever  Amen  FINIS
