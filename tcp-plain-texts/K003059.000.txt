 THE COUNTRY GIRL A COMEDY Altered from WYCHERLEY As it is ACTED at the TheatreRoyal in  DruryLane  DUBLIN Printed for W and W SMITH J HOEY Sen J MURPHY W WHITESTONE H SAUNDERS D CHAMBERLAINE J POTTS J HOEY Jun J WILLIAMS O ADAMS T RYDER and W COLLES  MDCCLXVI  Advertisement  THE Desire of shewing Miss REYNOLDS to Advantage was the first Motive for attempting an Alteration of WYCHERLEY'S COUNTRY WIFE Tho' near half of the following Play is new written the Alterer claims no Merit but his Endeavour to clear one of our most celebrated Comedies from Immorality and Obscenity He thought himself bound to preserve as much of the Original as could be presented to an Audience of these Times without Offence and if this Wanton of CHARLES'S Days is now so reclaimed as to become innocent without being insiped the present Editor will not think his Time ill employed which has enabled him to add some little Variety to the Entertainments of the Publick There seems indeed an absolute Necessity for reforming many Plays of our most eminent Writers For no kind of Wit ought to be received as an Excuse for for Immorality nay it becomes still more dangerous in proportion as it is more wittyWithout such a Reformation our  English  Comedies must be reduced to a very small Number and would pall by a too frequent Repetition or what is worse continue shameless in spite of publick Disapprobation  Whatever fate this Play may have in the Closet it is much indebted to the Preformers for its favourable Reception upon the Stage  Dramatis Personae  Moody  Mr HOLLAND  Harcourt  Mr PALMER  Sparkish

age I was asham'd toobut three years at College and half a one at Paris methinks should have cur'd you of that unfashionable weaknessmodesty  Belv  Could I have releas'd myself from that I had perhaps been at this instant happy in the possession of what I must despair now ever to obtainheigho  Harc  Ha ha ha very foolish indeed  Belv  Don't laugh at me uncle I am foolish I know but like other fools I deserve to be pitied  Harc  Prithee don't talk of pity how can I help youfor this country girl of yours is certainly married  Belv  No noI won't believe it she is not married nor she shan't If I can help it  Harc  Well said modestywith such a spirit you can help yourself Dick without my assistance  Belv  But you must encourage and advise me too or I shall never make any thing of it  Harc  Provided the girl is not married for I never never encourage young men to covet their neighbours wives  Belv  My heart assures me that she is not married  Harc  O to be sure your heart is much to be rely'd uponbut to convince you that I have a fellowfeeling of your distress and that I am as nearly ally'd to you in missortunes as in relationshipyou must know  Belv  What uncle you alarm me  Harc  That I am in love too  Belv  Indeed  Harc  Miserably in love  Belv  That's charming  Harc  And my mistress is just going to be married to another  Belv  Better and better  Harc  I knew my

from his chair  Harc  Well said jealousyNo no set your heart at restYour Peggy is too young and too simple for meI must have one a little more knowing a little better bred just old enough to see the difference between me and a coxcomb spirit enough to break from a brother's engagements and chuse for herself  Belv  You don't mean Alithea who is to be married to Mr Sparkish  Harc  Can't I be in love with a lady that is going to be married to another as well as you Sir  Belv  But Sparkish is your friend  Harc  Prithee don't call him my friend he can be  nobody's friend not even his ownHe would thrust himself into my acquaintance would introduce me to his mistress tho' I have told him again and again that I was in love with her which instead of ridding me of him has made him only ten times more troublesomeand me really in loveHe should suffer for his selfsufficiency  Belv  'Tis a conceited puppyAnd what success with the lady  Harc  No great hopesand yet if I could defer the marriage a few days I should not despairher honour I am confident is her only attachment to my rivalshe can't like Sparkish and if I can work upon his credulity a credulity which even popery would be asham'd of I may yet have the chance of throwing sixes upon the dice to save me  Belv  Nothing can save  me  Harc  No not if you whine and sigh when you should be exerting every thing that is man about you I have sent Sparkish who is admitted at all hours in the house to know how the land lies for you and if she is not married already  Belv  How cruel you areyou raise me up with one hand and then knock me down with the other  Harc  Well well she shan't be married  knocking at the door  This is Sparkish I suppose don't drop the least hint of your passion to him if you do you may as well advertise it in the publick papers  Belv  I'll be careful  Enter Servant  Serv  An odd sort of a person from the country I believe who calls himself Moody wants to see you Sir but as I did not know him I said you were not at home but would return directly  and so will I too  said he very short and surly and away he went mumbling to himself  Harc  Very well WillI'll see him when he comes  Exit Servant  Moody call to see meHe has something more in his head than making me a visit'tis to complain of you I suppose  Belv  How can he know me  Harc  We must suppose the worst and be prepared for himtell me all you know of this ward of his this PeggyPeggy what's her name  Belv  Thrift Thrift uncle  Harc  Ay ay Sir Thomas Thrift's daughter of Hampshire and left very young under the guardianship of my old companion and acquaintance Jack Moody  Belv  Your companionhe's old enough to be your father  Harc  Thank you nephewhe has greatly the advantage of me in years as well as wisdomWhen I first launched from the university into this ocean of Londonhe was the greatest rake in it I knew him well for near two years but all of a sudden he tooka freak a very prudent one of retiring wholly into the country  Belv  There he gain'd such an ascendency over the odd disposition of his neighbour Sir Thomas that he left him sole guardian to his daughter who forfeits half her fortune if she does not marry with his consentthere's the devil uncle  Harc  And are you so young so foolish and so much in love that you would take her with half her value ha nephew  Belv  I'll take her with any thingwith nothing  Harc  What such an unaccomplish'd aukward silly creaturehe has scarce taught her to writeshe has seen nobody to converse with but the country people about 'em so she can do nothing but dangle her arms look gawky turn her toes in and talk broad Hampshire  Belv  Don't abuse her sweet simplicityhad you but heard her talk as I have done from the gardenwall in the country by moonlight  Harc  Romeo and Juliet I protest ha ha ha  Arise fair sun and kill the envious  ha ha ha How often have you seen this fair Capulet  Belv  I saw her three times in the country and spoke to her twice I have leap'd an orchardwall like Romeo to come at her play'd the balconyscene from an old summerhouse in the garden and if I lose her I  will find out an apothecary and play the tombscene too for I cannot bear to be cross'd in love  Harc  Well said Dickthis spirit must produce somethingbut has the old dragon ever caught you sighing at her  Belv  Never in the country he saw me yesterday kissing my hand to her from the new tavernwindow that looks upon the back of his house and immediately drove her from it and fasten'd up the windowshutters  Sparkish without  Spark  Very well Will I'll go up to 'em  Harc  I hear Sparkish coming uptake care of what I told younot a word of Peggyhear his intelligence and make use of it without seeming to mind it  Belv  Mum mum uncle  Enter Sparkish  Spar  O my dear Harcourt I shall die with laughingI have such news for theeha ha haWhat your nephew too and a little dumpish or soyou have been giving him a lecture upon oeconomy I supposeyou who never had any can best describe the evils that arise from the want of itI never mind my own affairs not II hear Mr Belville you have got a pretty snug house with a bowwindow that looks into the Park and a backdoor that goes out into itVery convenient and well imagin'dno young handsome fellow should be without oneyou may be always ready there like a spider in his web to seize upon stray'd women of quality  Harc  As you us'd to doyou vain fellow youprithee don't teach my nephew your abandoned trickshe is a modest young man and you must not spoil him  Spark  May be so but his modesty has done some mischief at our housemy surly jealous brotherinlaw saw that modest young gentleman casting a wishful eye at his forbidden fruit from the new tavern window  Belv  You mistake the person Mr Sparkish I don't know what young lady you mean  Harc  Explain yourself Sparkish you must mistakeDick has never seen the girl  Spar  I don't say he has I only tell you what  Moody  says Besides he went to the tavern himself and enquir'd of the waiter who din'd in the backroomNo and they told him it was Mr Belville your nephewthat's all I know of the matter or desire to know of itfaith  Harc  He kiss'd his hand indeed to your lady Alithea and is more in love with her than you are and very near as much as I am so look about you such a youth may be dangerous  Spar  The more danger the more honour I defy you bothwin her and wear her if you can  Dolus an virtus  in love as well as in wartho' you must be expeditious faith for I believe if I don't change my mind I shall marry her tomorrow or the day afterHave you no honest clergyman Harcourt no fellowcollegian to recommend to me to do the business  Harc  Nothing ever sure was so lucky  aside  Why faith I have Sparkishmy brother a twinbrother Ned Harcourt will be in town to day and proud to attend your commandsI am a very generous rival you see to lend my brother to marry the woman I love  Spar  And so am I too to let your brother come so near usBut Ned shall be the man poor Alithea grows impatientI can't put off the evil day any longerI fancy the brute her brother has a mind to marry his country ideot at the same time  Belv  How country idiot Sir  Harc  Taisez vous bete  aside to  Belv    I thought he had been married already  Spar  No no he's not married that's the joke of it  Belv  No no he is not married  Harc  Hold your tongue  elbowing  Belville  Spark  Not heI have the finest story to tell youby the by he intends calling upon you for he ask'd me where you liv'd to complain of  modesty  thereHe pick'd up an old raking acquaintance of his as we came along togetherWill Frankly who saw him with his girl sculking and mu  led up at the play last nighthe plagu'd him much about matrimony and his  being asham'd to shew himself swore he was in love with his wife and intended to cuckold him do you cry'd Moody folding his arms and scouling with his eyes thus  You must have more wit than you us'd to haveBesides if you have as much as you think you have I shall be out of your reach and this profligate metropolis in less than a week  Moody would feign have got rid of him but the other held him by the sleeve so I left 'em rejoic'd most luxuriously to see the poor devil tormented  Belv  I thought you said just now that he was not marriedis not that a contradiction Sir    Harcourt  still makes signs to  Belville  Spark  Why it is a kind of a onebut considering your modesty and your ignorance of the young lady you are pretty tolerably inquisitive methinks ha Harcourt ha ha ha  Harc  Pooh pooh don't talk to that baby tell me all you know  Spark  You must know my boody of a brotherinlaw hath brought up this ward of his a good fortune let me tell you as he coops up and fattens his chickens for his own eatinghe is plaguy jealous of her and was very sorry that he could not marry her in the country without coming up to town which he could not do on account of some writings or other so what does my gentleman he persuades that poor silly girl by breaking a sixpence or some nonsense or another that they are to all intents married in heaven but that the laws require the signing of articles and the church service to compleat their unionso he has made her call him husband and bud which she constantly does and he calls her wife and gives out she is married that she may not look after younger fellows nor younger fellows after her egad ha ha ha and all won't do  Belv  Thank you Sirwhat heav'nly news uncle  Harc  What an ideot you are nephew And so then you make but one trouble of it and are both to be tack'd together the same day  Spark  No▪ no he can▪t be married this week he damns the lawyers for keeping him in townbesides  I am out of favour and he is continually snarling at me and abusing me for not being jealous  knocking at the door  There he isI must not be seen with you for he'll suspect something I'll go with your nephew to his house and we'll wait for you and make a visit to my wife that is to be and perhaps we shall shew young Modesty here a sight of Peggy too  Enter Servant  Serv  Sir here's the strange odd sort of a gentleman come again and I have shewn him into the foreparlour  Spark  That must he Moody well said Will an odd sort of a strange gentleman indeed we'll step into the next room 'till he comes into this and then you may have him all to yourselfmuch good may do you    Sparkish  going returns  Remember that he is married or he'll suspect me of betraying him  Exit  Sparkish and Belville  Harc  Shew him up Will Now must I prepare myself to see a very strange tho' a very natural metamorphosisa once highspirited handsome welldress'd raking prodigal of the town sunk into a surly suspicious oeconomical country slovenle voila  Enter  Moody  Moody  Mr Harcourt your humble servanthave you forgot me  Harc  What my old friend Jack Moody by thy long absence from the town the grumness of thy countenance and the slovenlyness of thy habit I should give thee joyyou are certainly married  Moody  My long stay in the country will excuse my dress and I have a suit of law that brings me up to town and puts me out of humourbesides I must give Sparkish ten thousand pounds tomorrow to take my sister off my hands  Harc  Your sister is very much obliged to youbeing so much older than her you have taken upon you the authority of a father and have engaged her to a coxcomb  Moody  I have and to oblige hernothing but coxcombs or debauchees are the favourites nowadays and a coxcomb is rather the more innocent animal of the two  Harc  She has sense and taste and can't like him so you must answer for the consequences  Moody  When she is out of my hands her husband must look to consequences He's a fashionable fool and will cut his horns kindly  Harc  And what is to secure your worship from consequencesI did not expect marriage from such a rakeone that knew the town so well fye fye Jack  Moody  I'll tell you my securityI have married no London wife  Harc  That's all onethat grave circumspection in marrying a country wife is like refusing a deceitful pamper'd Smithfieldjade to go and be cheated by a friend in the country  Moody  I wish the devil had both him and his simile  aside  Harc  Well never grumble about it what's done can't be undone is your wife handsome and young  Moody  She has little beauty but her youth nothing to brag of but her health and no attraction but her modestywholesome homely and housewifelythat's all  Harc  You talk as like a grazier as you look Jackwhy did you not bring her to town before to be taught something  Moody  Which something I might repent as long as I liveNo no women and private soldiers should beignorant  Harc  But prithee why wouldst thou marry her if she be ugly illbred and silly She must be rich then  Moody  As rich as if she had the wealth of the mogulshe'll not ruin her husband like a London baggage with a million of vices she never heard ofthen because she's ugly she's the likelier to be my own and being illbred she'll hate conversation and since silly and innocent will not know the difference between me and you that is between a man of thirty and one of forty  Harc  Fifty to my knowledge    Moody  turns off and grumbles  But see how you and I differ Jackwit to me is more necessary than beauty I think no young woman ugly that has it and no handsome woman agreeable without it  Moody  'Tis my maximHe's a fool that marries but he's a greater that does not marry a foolI know the town Mr Harcourt and my wife shall be virtuous in spite of you or your nephew  Harc  My nephewpoor sheepish ladhe runs away from every woman he seeshe saw your sister Alithea at the opera and was much smitten with herHe always toasts herand hates the very name of Sparkish I'll bring him to your houseand you shall see what a formidable Tarquin he is  Moody  I have no curiosity so give yourself no troubleYou have heard of a wolf in sheep's cloathing and I have seen your innocent nephew kissing his hands at my windows  Harc  At your sister I suppose nor at her unless he was tipsyHow can you Jack be so outragiously suspicious Sparkish has promis'd to introduce him to his mistress  Moody  Sparkish is a fool and may be what I'll take care not to beI confess my visit to you Mr Harcourt was partly for old acquaintance sake but chiefly to desire your nephew to confine his gallantries to the tavern and not send 'em in looks signs or tokens on the other side the wayI keep no brothelso pray tell your nephew  going  Harc  Nay prithee Jack leave me in better humourWell I'll tell him ha ha ha poor Dick how he'll stare This will give him a reputation and the girls won't laugh at him any longer Shall we dine together at the tavern and send for my nephew to chide him for his gallantry ha ha ha we shall have fine sport  Moody  I am not to be laught out of my senses Mr HarcourtI was once a modest meek young gentleman myself and I never have been half so mischievous before or since as I was in that state of innocenceAnd so old friend make no ceremony with meI have  much business and you have much pleasure and therefore as I hate forms I will excuse your returning my visit or sending your nephew to satisfy me of his modestyand so your servant  Exit  Harc  alone  Ha ha ha poor Jack what a life of suspicion does he lead I pity the poor fellow tho' he ought and will suffer for his follyFolly 'tis treason murder sacrilege When persons of a certain age will indulge their false ungenerous appetites at the expence of a young creature's happiness dame nature will revenge herself upon them for thwarting her most heavenly will and pleasure  ACT II  SCENE a Chamber in  Moody  's house  Enter Miss  Peggy  and  Alithea  Peg  PRAY sister where are the best fields and woods to walk in in London

mushrooms upon dunghills  Harc  This Mr Moody is my nephew you mentioned to me I would bring him with me for a sight of him will be sufficient without poppy or mandragora to restore you to your rest  Belv  I am sorry Sir that any mistake or imprudence of mine should have given you any uneasiness it was not so intended I assure you Sir  Moody  It may be so Sir but not the less criminal for thatMy wife Sir must not be smirk'd and nodded at from tavern windows I am a good shot young gentleman and don't suffer magpyes to come near my cherries  Belv  Was it your wife Sir  Moody  What's that to you

if thou lik'st her as well as everMy dear don't look down I should hate to have a wife of mine out of countenance at any thing  Alith  For shame Mr Sparkish  Spark  Tell me I say Harcourt how dost like her thou hast star'd upon her enough to resolve me  Harc  So infinitely well that I could wish I had a mistress too that might differ from her in nothing but her love and engagement to you  Alith  Sir Mr Sparkish has often told me that his acquaintance were all wits and railers and now I find it  Spark  No by the universe Madam he does not rally now you may believe him I do assure you he is the honestest worthiest truehearted gentleman  a man of such perfect honour he would say nothing to a lady he does not mean  Harc  Sir you are so beyond expectation obliging that  Spark  Nay egad I am

Harc  Yes above the world or the most glorious part of it her whole sex and till now I never thought I should have envied you or any man about to marry but you have the best excuse to marry I ever knew  Alith  Nay now Sir I am satisfied you are of the society of the wits and railers since you cannot spare your friend even when he is most civil to you but the surest sign is you are an enemy to marriage the common butt of every railer  Harc  Truly Madam I was never an enemy to marriage till now because marriage was never an enemy to me before  Alith  But why Sir is marriage an enemy to you now because it robs you of your friend here for you look upon a friend married as one gone into a monastery that is dead to the world  Harc  'Tis indeed because you marry him I see Madam you can guess my meaning I do confess heartily and openly I wish it were in my power to break the match by heavens I wou'd  Spark  Poor Frank  Alith  Wou'd you be so unkind to me  Harc  No no 'tis not because I

person  Harc  I cou'd gaze upon her till I became as blind as you are  Spark  How as I am how  Harc  Because you are a lover and true lovers are blind stock blind  Spark  True true but by the world she has wit too as well as beauty go go with her into a corner and try if she has wit talk to her any thing she's bashful before me  Alith  Sir you dispose of me a little before your time  aside to Sparkish  Spark  Nay nay Madam let me have an earnest of your obedience orgo go Madam    Harc  courts  Alithea  aside  Enter  Moody  Moody  How Sir if you are not concern'd for the honour of a wife I am for that of a sister be a pander to your own wife bring men to her let e'm make love before your face hust 'em into a corner together then leave 'em in private is this your town wit and conduct  Spark  Ha ha ha a silly wise rogue wou'd make one laugh more than a stark fool ha ha ha I shall burst Nay you shall not disturb'em I'll vex thee by the world What have you done with Belville  Struggles  with Moody  to keep him from  Harcourt  and  Alithea  Moody  Shewn him the way out of my house as you should to that gentleman  Spark  Nay but pritheelet me reason with thee  Talks a part with  Moody  Alith  The writings are drawn Sir settlements made 'tis too late Sir and past all revocation  Harc  Them so is my death  Alith  I wou'd not be unjust to him  Harc  Then why to me so  Alith  I have no obligation to you  Harc  My love  Alith  I had his before  Harc  You never had it he wants you see jealousy the only infallible sign of it  Alith  Love proceeds from esteem he cannot distrust my virtue besides he loves me or he would not marry me  Harc  Marrying you is no more a sign of his lo ve than bribing your woman that he may marry you is a sign of his generosity But if you take marriage for a sign of lo ve take it from me immediately  Alith  No now you have put a scruple in my head but in short Sir to end our dispute I must marry him my reputation wou'd suffer in the world else  Harc  No if you do marry him with your pardon Madam your reputation suffers in the world  Alith  Nay now you are rude SirMr Sparkish pray come hither your friend here is very troublesome and very loving  Harc  Hold hold  aside to Alithea  Moody  D'ye hear thatsenseless puppy  Spark  Why d'ye think I'll seem jealous like a country bumkin  Moody  No rather be dishonour'd like a credulous driv'ler  Harc  Madam you would not have been so little generous as to have told him  Alith  Yes since you could be so little generous as to wrong him  Harc  Wrong him no man can do't he's beneath an injury a bubble a coward a senseless idiot a wretch so contemptible to all the world but you that  Alith  Hold do not rail at him for since he is like to be my husband I am resolv'd to like him nay I think I am oblig'd to tell him you are not his friendMr Sparkish Mr Sparkish  Spark  What what now dear rogue has not she wit  Harc  Not so much as I thought and hoped she had  surlily  Alith  Mr Sparkish do you bring people to rail at you  Harc  Madam  Spark  How no but if he does rail at me 'tis but in jest I warrant what we wits do for one another and never take any notice of it

There's no love lost between us  Moody  You admitted those gentlemen into the house when I said I wou'd not be at home and there was the young fellow too that behav'd so indecently to my wife at the

me and before I left his lodgings I took an opportunity of conveying some tender sentiments thro' Lucy to Miss Peggy and it was Lucy advis'd me to strole here this evening and here I am in expectation of seeing my country goddess  Harc  And so to blind Moody and take him off the scent of your passion for this girl and at the same time to give me an opportunity with Sparkish's mistress and of which I have made the most you hinted to him with a grave melancholy face that you were dying for his sistergadamercy nephew I will back thy modesty against any other in the three kingdomsIt will do Dick  Belv  What could I do uncleit was my last stake and I play'd for a great deal  Harc  You mistake me Dick I don't say you could do betterI only can't account for your modesty's doing so much you have done such wonders that I who am rather bold than sheepish have not yet ceas'd wondering at you But do you think that you impos'd upon him  Belv  Faith I can't sayI am rather doubtful he said very little grumbled much shook his head and shew'd me the doorBut what success have you had with Alithea  Harc  Just enough to have a glimmering of hope without having light enough to see an inch before my noseThis day will produce something Alithea is a woman of great honour and will sacrifice her happiness to it unless Sparkish's absurdity stand my friend and does every thing that the fates ought to do for me  Belv  Yonder comes the prince of coxcombs and if your mistress and mine should by chance be tripping this way this fellow will spoil sportlet us avoid himyou can't cheat him before his face  Harc  But I can tho' thanks to my wit and his want of it a foolish rival and a jealous husband assist their rivals designs for they are sure to make their women hate them which is their first step to their love for another man  Belv  But you cannot come near his mistress but in his company  Harc  Still the better for me nephew for fools are most easily cheated when they themselves are accessaries and he is to be bubbled of his mistress or of his money the common mistress by keeping him company  Enter  Sparkish  Spark  Who's that is to be bubbled faith let me snack I han't met with a bubble since Christmas 'Gad I think bubbles are like their brother woodcocks go out with the cold weather  Harc  O pox he did not hear all I hope  apart to  Belville  Spark  Come you bubbling rogues you where do we sup O Harcourt my mistress tells me you have made love fierce love to her last night all the play long ha ha ha but I  Harc  I make love to her  Spark  Nay I forgive thee and I know her but I am sure I know myself  Belv  Do you Sir Then you are the wisest man in the world and I honour you as such  bowing  Spark  O your servant Sir you are at your raillery are youYou can't oblige me moreI'm your manHe'll meet with his matchHa HarcourtDid not you hear me laugh prodigiously at the play last night  Harc  Yes and was very much disturb'd at itYou put the actors and audience into confusionand all your friends out of countenance  Spark  So much the betterI love confusionand to see folks out of countenanceI was in tip top spirits faith and said a thousand good things  Belv  But I thought you had gone to plays to laugh at the poet's good things and not at your own  Spark  Your servant Sir no I thank you 'Gad I go to a play as to a country treat I carry my own wine to one and my own wit to t'other or else I'm sure I should not be merry at either and the reason why we are so often louder than the players is because we hate authors damnably  Belv  But why should you hate the poor rogues you have too much wit and despise writing I'm fure  Spark  O yes I despise writing But women women that make men do all foolish things make 'em write songs too Every body does it 'Tis e'en as common with lovers as playing with fans and you can no more help rhyming to your Phillis than drinking to your Phillis  Harc  But the poets damn'd your songs did they  Spark  O yes damn the poets they turn'd them into burlesque as they call it That burlesque is a hocus pocus trick they have got which by the virtue of hictius doctius topsey turvey they make a clever witty thing absolute nonsense do you know Harcourt that they ridicul'd my last song  twang    twang  the best I ever wrote  Harc  That may be and be very easily ridicul'd for all that  Belv  Favour me with it Sir I never heard it  Spark  What and have all the Park about us  Harc  Which you'll not dislike and so prithee begin  Spark  I never am ask'd twiceand so have at you  SONG  I  Tell not me of the roses and lilies  Which tinge the fair cheek of your Phillis  Tell not me of the dimples and eyes  For which silly Corydon dies  Let all whining lovers go hang  My heart would you hit  Tip your arrow with wit  And it comes to my heart with a twang twang  And it comes to my heart with a twang  II  I am rock to the handsome and pretty  Can only be touch'd by the witty  And beauty will ogle in vain  The way to my heart's thro' my brain  Let all whining lovers go hang  We wits you must know  Have two strings to our bow  To return them their darts with a twang twang  And return them their darts with a twang  At the end of the song  Harcourt  and  Belville  steal away from  Sparkish  and leave him singingHe sinks his voice by degrees at the surprise of their being gone then  Enter  Harcourt  and  Belville  Spark  What the deuce did you go away for  Harc  Your mistress is coming  Spark  The devil she isO hide hide me from her  hides behind  Harcourt  Harc  She sees you  Spark  But I will not see her for I'm engag'd and at this instant  looking at his watch  Harc  Pray first take me and reconcile me to her  Spark  Another time faith it is to a lady and one cannot make excuses to a woman  Belv  You have need of 'em I believe  Spark  Pshaw prithee hide me  Moody    Peggy  and  Alithea  appear  Harc  Your servant Mr Moody  Moody  Come along  to  Peggy  Peg  Lauwhat a sweet delightful place this is  Moody  Come along I saydon't stare about you soyou'll betray yourself  Exit  Moody  pulling  Peggy    Alithea  following  Harc  He does not know us  Belv  Or he won't know us  Spark  So much the better  Exit  Belville  after them at a distance  Harc  Who is that pretty youth with him Sparkish  Spark  Some relation of Peggy's I suppose for he is something like her in face and gawkyness  Belville  returns  Belv  By all my hopes unclePeggy in man's clothesI am all over agitation  aside to  Harc  Harc  Be quiet or you'll spoil all They returnAlithea has seen you Sparkish and will be angry if you don't go to her besides I wou'd fain be reconcil'd to her which none but you can do my dear friend  Spark  Well that's a better reason dear friend I wou'd not go near her now for her's or my own sake but I can deny you nothing for tho' I have known thee a great while never go if I do not love thee as well as a new acquaintance  Harc  I am obliged to you indeed my dear friend I wou'd be well with her only to be well with thee still for these ties to wives usually dissolve all ties to friends  Spark  But they shan't tho'come along  they retire  Reenter  Moody  and  Peggy  in man's

something too cruel Madam to hate me for his sake  Spark  Ay indeed Madam too too cruel to me to hate my friend for my sake  Alith  I hate him because he is your enemy and you ought to hate him too for making love to me if you love me  Spark  That's a good one I hate a man for loving you If he did love you 'tis but what he can't help and 'tis your fault not his if he admires you  Alith  Is it for your honour or mine to suffer a man to make love to me who am to marry you tomorrow  Harc  But why dearest Madam will you be more concern'd for his honour than he is himself Let his honour alone for my sake and his He has no honour  Spark  How's that  Harc  But what my dear friend can guard himself  Spark  O hothat's right again  Alith  You astonish me Sir with want of jealousy  Spark  And you make me giddy Madam with your jealousy and fears and virtue and honour 'Gad I see virtue makes a woman as troublesome as a little reading or learning  Harc  Come Madam you see you strive in vain to make him jealous of me my dear friend is the kindest creature in the world to me  Spark  Poor fellow  Harc  But his kindness only is not enough for me without your favour your good opinion dear Madam 'tis that must perfect my happiness Good gentleman he believes all I say wou'd you wou'd do so Jealous of me I wou'd not wrong him nor you for the world  Spark  Look you there hear him hear him

you that I wou'd not have you miserable and cast yourself away upon so unworthy and inconsiderable a thing as what you see here  Clapping his hand on his breast points to  Sparkish  Spark  No faith I believe thou wou'dst not now his meaning is plain but I knew before thou wou'dst not wrong me nor her  Harc  No no heav'ns forbid the glory of her sex shou'd fall so low as into the embraces of such a contemptible  temptible wretch the least of mankindmy dear friend hereI injure him  embracing  Sparkish  Alith  Very well  Spark  No no dear friend I knew it Madam you see he will rather wrong himself than me in giving himself such names  Alith  Do not you understand him yet  Spark  Come come you shall stay till he has saluted you that I may be assur'd you are friends after his honest advice and declaration come pray Madam be friends with him  Enter  Moody  and  Peggy Belville  at a distance  Alith  You must pardon me Sir that I am not yet so obedient to you  Moody  What invite your wife to

Lucy  WELL Madam now I have dress'd you and set you out with so many ornaments and spent so much time upon you and all this for no other purpose but to bury you alive for I look upon Mr Sparkish's bed to be little better than a grave  Alith  Hold your peace  Lucy  Nay Madam I will ask you the reason why you would banish poor Mr Harcourt for ever from your sight how cou'd you be so hardhearted  Alith  'Twas because I was not hardhearted  Lucy  No no 'twas stark love and kindness I warrant  Alith  It was so I would see him no more because I love him  Lucy  Hey day a very pretty reason  Alith  You do not understand me  Lucy  I wish you may yourself  Alith  I was engag'd to marry you see another man whom my justice will not suffer me to deceive or injure  Lucy  Can there be a greater cheat or wrong done to a man than to give him your person without your heart I should make a conscience of it  Alith  I'll retrieve it for him after I am married  Lucy  The woman that marries to love better will be as much mistaken as the rake that marries to live better  Alith  What nonsense you talk  Lucy  'Tis a melancholy truth MadamMarrying to increase love is like gaming to become richAlas you only lose what little stock you had beforeThere are many woeful examples of it in this righteous town  Alith  I find by your rhetorick you have been brib'd to betray me  Lucy  Only by his merit that has brib'd your heart you see against your word and rigid honour  Alith  Come pray talk no more of honour nor Mr Harcourt I wish the other wou'd come to secure my fidelity to him and his right in me  Lucy  You will marry him then  Alith  Certainly I have given him already my word and will my hand too to make it good when he comes  Lucy  Well I wish I may never stick a pin more if he be not an errant natural to t'other fine gentleman  Alith  I own he wants the wit of Harcourt which I will dispense withal for another want he has which is want of jealousy which men of wit seldom want  Lucy  Lord Madam what shou'd you do with a fool to your husband You intend to be honest don't you Then that husbandly virtue credulity is thrown away upon you  Alith  He only that cou'd suspect my virtue shou'd have cause to do it 'tis Sparkish's confidence in my truth that obliges me to be faithful to him  Lucy  What faithful to a creature who is incapable of loving and esteeming you as he oughtTo throw away your beauty wit accomplishments sweet temper  Alith  Hold your tongue  Lucy  That you know I can't do Madam and upon this occasion I will talk for everWhat give yourself away to one that poor I your maid would not accept of  Alith  How Lucy  Lucy  I would not upon my honour Madam 'tis never too late to repent Take a man and give up your coxcomb I say  Enter Servant  Serv  Mr Sparkish with company Madam attends you below  Alith  I will wait upon 'em  Exit Servant  My heart begins to fail me but I must go through with it go with me Lucy  Exit  Lucy  Not I indeed MadamIf you will leap the

so there was no harm done you know  Moody  This is worse and worseso 'tis plain she loves him yet she has not love enough to make her conceal it from me but the sight of him will encrease her aversion

up in your chamber till I come back and be sure you come not within three strides of the window when I am gone for I have a spy in the street  puts her into the chamber  At least 'tis fit she thinks so if we do not cheat women they'll cheat us and fraud may be justly used with secret enemies of which a wife is the most dangerous and he that has a handsome one to keep and a frontier town must provide against treachery rather than open forceNow I have secured all within I'll deal with the foe without with false intelligence This will dash all his impudent hopes  holds up the letter  at once and I shall sleep now securely in my garrison without fear of surprizeBut no time is to be lostI'll steal a march upon him  Exit  SCENE changes to  Belville  's lodgings  Enter  Lucy  and  Belville  Lucy  I run great risques to be sure to serve the young lady and you Sirbut I know you are a gentleman of honour and wou'd scorn to betray a friend who means you well and is above being mercenary  Belv  As you are not mercenary Mrs Lucy I ought to be the more generousgive me leave to present you with this trifle  gives a ring  not as a reward for services but as a small token of friendship  Lucy  Tho' I scorn to be brib'd in any cause yet I am proud to accept it as a mark of your regard and as such shall keep it for your sakeand now to business  Belv  You flatter me then that Miss Peggy has the most rooted aversion for her guardian and some prejudices in my favour  Lucy  She has intrusted me with her very thoughtsand I have rais'd her disobedience to such a pitch  that she would have open'd her whole heart to you in a letter had we not been interrupted by her brutal guardian  Belv  She told me in the Park that you had convinced her she was not married to him  Lucy  There was not much difficulty in that but if any thing could have frighten'd her into that belief her filthy guardian had done itHe made her almost believe that the saving her soul depended upon marrying himDid you ever hear of such a reprobate  Belv  How I adore her bewitching simplicity  Lucy  Simplicity Sir she's able to make a fool of any of usif I had half her wit I would not continue long in service as well as I love my mistress  Belv  But dear Lucy what can Miss Peggy propose  Lucy  To run away from her guardian and marry you  Belv  She might have done both and lost the opportunity  Lucy  She will do both and make an opportunity if it does not come of itself The thought of running away or of being married when taken separately will put any maiden of us into great confusion but when they come both together are too much for the boldest of usMiss Peggy was overpower'd with your proposal and no wonder she could not determine for the best I should have been a little frighten'd myself  Belv  But has the dear creature resolv'd  Lucy  Has shewhy she will run away and marry you in spite of your teeth the first moment she can break prisonso you in your turn must take care not to have your qualmsI have known several bold gentlemen not able to draw their swords when a challenge has come too quick upon 'em  Belv  I assure you Mrs Lucy that I am no bully in love and Miss Peggy will meet with her match come when she will  Lucy  Ay so you all say but talking does no businessstay at home till you hear from us  Belv  Blessings on thee Lucy for the thought  Moody  speaking without  Moody

our cursed luck againwhat the devil can he want hereI have lost my sensesget into this closet till he's gone  puts  Lucy  into the closet  This visit means something I am quite confoundedDon't you stir LucyI must put the best face upon the matterNow for it  takes a book and reads  Enter  Moody  Moody  You will excuse me Sir for breaking thro' forms and your servant's intreaties to have the honourbut you are alone Siryour fellow told me below that you were with company  Belv  Yes Sir the best company  shews his book  When I converse with my betters I chuse to have 'em alone  Moody  And I chose to interrupt your conversation the business of my errand must plead my excuse  Belv  You shall be always welcome to mebut you seem ruffled Sir what brings you hither and so seemingly out of humour  Moody  Your impertinencyI beg pardonyour modesty I mean  Belv  My impertinency  Moody  Your impertinency  Belv  Sir from the peculiarity of your character and your intimacy with my uncle I shall allow you great privileges but you must consider youth has its privileges too and as I have not the honour of your acquaintance I am not oblig'd to bear with your ill humours or your ill manners  Moody  They who wrong me young man must bear with both and if you had not made too free with me I should have taken no liberties with you  Belv  I don't understand you Sir but you gentlemen who have handsome wives think you have a privilege of saying any thing to us young fellows and are as brutish as if you were our creditors  Moody  I shan't trust you any way  Belv  But why so diffident Sir you don't know me  Moody  I am not diffident young man but certain because I think I do know you  Belv  I could have wish'd Sir to have found you a little more civil the first time I have the honour of a visit from you  Moody  If that is all you want young gentleman you will find me very civil indeed There Sirread that and let your modesty declare whether I want either kindness or civilityLook you there Sir  gives a letter  Belv  What is't  Moody  Only a love letter Sirand from my wife  Belv  How is it from your wifehum and hum  reads  Moody  Even from my wife Sir am not I wond'rous kind and civil to you now too But you'll not think her so  aside  Belv  Ha is this a trick of his or her's  aside  Moody  The gentleman's surpriz'd I find what you expected a kinder letter  Belv  No faith not I how could I  Moody  Yes yes I'm sure you did a man so young and well made as you are must needs be disappointed if the women declare not their passion at the first sight or opportunity  Belv  But what shou'd this mean It seems he knows not what the letter contains  aside  Moody  Come ne'er wonder at it so much  Belv  Faith I can't help it  Moody  Now I think I have deserv'd your infinite friendship and kindness and have shew'd myself sufficiently an obliging kind friend and husbandam I not so to bring a letter from my wife to her gallant  Belv  Ay indeed you are the most obliging kind  friend and husband in the world ha ha ha Pray however present my humble service to her and tell her I will obey her letter to a tittle and fulfil her desires be what they will or with what difficulty

I am married or notI have no particular fancy one way or another and so I told your sister off or on 'tis the same thing to me but the thing was fix'd you knowYou and my Aunt brought it aboutI had no hand in it and to shew you that I was as willing to marry your sister as any other woman I suffered the law to tye me up to hard terms and the church would have finish'd me still to harderbut she was taken with her tantrums  Moody  Damn your tantrumscome to the point  Spark  Your sister took an aversion to the parson Frank Harcourt's brotherabus'd him like a pickpocket and swore 'twas Harcourt himself  Moody  And so it was for I saw him  Spark  Here's fine workwhy you are as mad as your sisterI tell you it was Ned Frank's twin brother  Moody  What Frank told you so  Spark  Ay and Ned

Moody  HaI thought the style was somewhat better than her own  aside  Cou'd she come to you to teach you since I had lock'd you up alone  Peg  Oh thro' the keyhole Bud  Moody  But why shou'd she make you write a letter for her to him since she can write herself  Peg  Why she said becausefor I was unwilling to do it  Moody  Because whatbecause  Peg  Because lest Mr Belville as he was so young shou'd be inconstant and refuse her or be vain afterwards and shew the letter she might disown it the hand not being hers  Moody  Belville againAm I to be deceivd again with that young hypocrite  Peg  You have deceiv'd yourself Bud you have indeedI have kept the secret for my sister's sake as long as I couldbut you must know itand shall know it too  cries  Moody  Dry your eyes  Peg  You always

whether Belville ever made her any promise and whether she will be marry'd to Sparkish or no  Peg  Pray dear Bud don't till I have spoke with her and told her that I have told you all for she'll kill me else  Moody  Go then and bid her come to me  Peg  Yes yes Bud  Moody  Let me see  Peg  I have just got time to know of Lucy who first set me on work what lye I shall tell next for I am e'en at my wits end  Exit  Peggy  Moody  Well I resolve it Belville shall have her I'd rather give him my sister than lend him my wife and such an alliance will prevent his pretensions to my wife sureI'll make

rather fight him for not marrying my sister than for debauching my wife for I will make her mine absolutely tomorrow and of the two I had rather find my sister too forward than my wife I expected no other from her free education as she calls it and her passion for the townWell wife and sister are names which make us expect love and duty pleasure and comfort but we find 'em plagues and torments and are equally tho' differently troublesome to their keeper But here she comes  steps on one side  Enter Miss  Peggy  dress'd like  Alithea  and as she passes over the stage seems to sigh sob and wipe her eyes  Peg  Heigho  Exit  Moody  comes forward  There the poor devil goes sighing and sobbing a woeful example of the fatal consequences of a town educationbut I am bound in duty as well as
