 A LETTER TO Mr DAVID HUME ON THE TRAGEDY OF DOUGLAS Its ANALYSIS AND THE CHARGE against Mr GARRICKâ–ª By an ENGLISH CRITIC    Sic ais ast ego contra  So thou fayest but I am of a contrary Opinion  LONDON Printed for J SCOTT in PaternosterRow MDCCLVII  A LETTER TO Mr DAVID HUME  SIR  _HAVING for a long time conceived the highest esteem for the variety of your literary merit a recommendation from you was almost a sanction to preengage my implicit approbation How high were my expectations raised by your dedicatory commendation of  the tragedy of Douglas  but alas how fallen from seeing its representation nor has a perusal since won me over as an admirer of it  Had the tragedy of  Douglas  been ushered into the world as the promise of a dramatic genius as such it ought to have been received with applause but its having been forced upon us authoritatively in competition with all antiquity and the moderns two obvious effects were produced in the minds of men to wit curiosity was excited in some jealousy provoked in others I am sorry to inform you Sir that in consequence your  national  judgment has been greatly  run upon here and your critical stocks reduced almost to bankruptcy  For my part when I first read your panegyrical paragraph I for some time hesitated as to the sincerity of it and could not help reflecting on the passage in  The Art of Sinking in Poetry  written by your truly ingenious countryman Dr  Arbuthnot  Take all the best qualities you can find in the most celebrated heroes if they will not be reduced to a consistency lay them  all in a heap  upon him But be sure they are qualities which your  patron  would be  thought to have  and to prevent any mistake which the world may be subject to select from the alphabet those capital letters that compose his name and set them at the head of a dedication  But on a second reading of it I changed opinion and have moreover been assured that what is written you meant to which in amaze I used the famous reply of "  Est il possible  " is it possible  The four great and revered names  Maffei Voltaire Olway Shakespear  which you have employed as supporters of  Douglas  put me in mind of the statue of  Lewis  XIV in  Paris  where the four nations  Germany Spain Holland  and  England  are chained round him as vanquished and lavishly accompanied with all the tokens of subjection However this may please the national vanity of the  French  all foreigners with reason laugh at the folly of the design and unpardonable foppery of the execution  I respect you too much Sir to make any unmannered or indelicate application such as "All fools admire but men of sense approve" and shall impeach you by an evidence whom I dare say will not be objected to yourselfand from the standard of taste  Strong sense united to delicate sentiment improved by practice perfected by comparison and cleared of all prejudice can alone entitle critics to this valuable character and the joint verdict of such whenever they are to be found is  the true standard of taste and beauty  Just expressions of passion and nature are sure after a little time to gain public vogue which they maintain for ever  According to this just and admirable doctrine what is likely to be the fate of  the tragedy of Douglas  Neglect and oblivion however illumined for the present by the flambeau you forgive the expression too partially or in the mildest terms too sanguinely hold before it  Not satisfied to have preluded to the assured triumph of this tragedy in your dedication an unprovoked and congenial enforcer of the extravagance of its merit has been artfully diffused thro' the public under the title of  The Tragedy of Douglas analysed  a seeming attack which the disappointed reader finds to be the second part of the same tune you had begun in your dedication and which is there quoted in order to be illustrated true in every article therefore to join issue the sooner we shall follow the method therein observed  From page seventh to twelfth is a tedious historical account of the fable quite too long for the proposed limits of this letter to be quoted and therefore I refer to it  The next heads proceeded to are the characters manners and diction Having nothing to object against what the analyser says relative to the two former the following citations will sufficiently shew that our disapprobation arises not from caprice but very justifiable motives  Lady RANDOLPH  For in your shades I deem some spirit dwells  Who from the  chiding  stream or  groaning  oak  Still  hears  and  answers  to MATILDA's moan  Wherefore  chiding groaning hears answers  This may be founded on some tradition or popular error of  Scotland  but to  English  understandings if not altogether nonsensical is at least chimerical  Thou do'st not think so  woeful  as I am  Woeful indeed  But whether goest thou now  Is a question in the low familiar  The misplaced and  Hors d'Oeuvre  compliment to the union  A river here there an ideal line c  is tedious and insipid the line it closes with flat  The youthful warriour is a  clod  of  clay  Clod  and  clay  are not only mean words but also cacophonous to the ear  ANNA  To dry  These piteous tears I'd  throw  my life  away  For but a confident there is a qualityease in this offer to oblige a friend But she soon relapses into a diction more apposite to her condition  Iwillspeaksonomore  and presents us at the same time with a nasty image  But silent mix  My tears with hers  Lady RANDOLPH  Can thy feeble pity  Roll  back the  flood  of never  ebbing  time  Is this strictly correct  ebb  and  flood  being opposites  Roll  is inadequate here  And with him  In spite of all my tears did MALCOLM go  That tears should have been shed rather to detain her but three weeks married husband  Douglas  than an unsubstitutive brother will be assented to by all young married ladies who are so unfashionable as to love their husbands  Fault'ring I took  An oath equivocal that I ne'er would  Wed one of  Douglas  ' name  This is a pretty jesuitical device she having been married to one already  ANNA  Never did I hear  A tale so sad as this  Nor any body else  Lady RANDOLPH  The good priest  Who join'd our hands my brother's antient tutor  With his lov'd  Malcolm  in the battle fell  They  two alone  were privy to the marriage  The poet is hard run here in order to distress his  heroine  Why kill the priest in battle Perhaps this action happened in the days of the  Church militant  Across the  Carron  lay  The  destin'd  road  This name of a river in  Scotland  from its likeness in sound to our  English  word  carrion  is grating to the ears of a  London  audience Why  destin'd  road  ANNA  The hand that spins th' uneven thread of life  May smooth the length that's yet to come of yours  This may appear a pretty figure to those acquainted with the art of spinning tho' it does not to me The last line is monosyllabically harsh a fault our author is often guilty of To  Anna  replies  Lady RANDOLPH  Not in this world  I should be glad to know in what other  Never were vice and virtue pois'd so ill  As in GLENALVON'S unrelenting mind  On the contrary I think never better if he played his varied parts with that subtlety and  Protean  art she ascribes to him  Lord RANDOLPH  Blush not  flower  of  modesty  Is an odd expression from one man to another and would be better addressed to one of the gentle sex  Lady RANDOLPH  I will be sworn thou wilt not  This is inelegant and not suited to the rank of the speaker  Lord RANDOLPH  Go with me NORVAL and thine eyes shall see  The chosen warriours of thy native land  Who languish for the fight and beat the air  With brandish'd swords  I dislike this picture of  Scotch  warriours  beating the air  the renowned Don  Quixote  indeed encountered windmills  GLENALVON  And  waves  the  flag  of her displeasure o'er me  This would not be improper from a seaofficer  Persistive  wisdom is the  fate  of man  I do not understand this line and confess my ignorance of what  persistive  means  We found him lurking in the hollow  glynn  Glynn  is a word used in  Scotland  and  Ireland  but not in the meridional parts of  England  NORVAL  Red  came the river down and loud and oft  The angry spirit of the water shriek'd  The meaning of  red  here and the  angry spirit of the water shrieking  are unknown to us  South Britons  By the moon's light I saw whirl'd round and round  A basket soon I drew it to the bank  And nestled curious there an infant lay  Quite the contrary and all drenched in water is most likely unless the basket had been purposely caulked from a foreknowledge of the event  Sir MALCOLM of our barons was the  flower  Our author seems fond of the word  flower  to mark male eminence wherefore pursuant to the baptismal vows you have made for him as his sponsor not at all alluding to the song let him be called the  flower  of  Edinburgh  's tragic writers for on this side of the  Tweed  nothing more will or ought to be allowed him  The panegyrical analyser  place="foot" N="*" A pamphlet in favours of this play entituled  Douglas Analysed  was lately published at London where a great number of passages are quoted as the most exalted sentiment as well as poetical fancy that has appeared in our day  who has quoted many indifferent has in my sense omitted several  of the most beautiful passages which as they occur I shall insert in this letter for instance  Lady RANDOLPH  What does my ANNA think  Of the young eaglet of a valiant nest  How soon he gaz'd on bright and burning arms  Spurn'd the low dunghill where his fate had thrown him  And tower'd up to the region of his fire  ANNA  Mysterious nature with the unseen cord  Of powerful instinct drew you to your own  A  cord  is a visible substance besides this is too gross and material an image of the power of instinct  GLENALVON  The field  Must man to man and foot to foot be  ought  This rather excites an idea of two armies wrestling than fighting with offensive weapons  Here follow other unpardonable omissions by the analyser  Lord RANDOLPH  An army knit like ours would pierce it thro'  Brothers that shrink not from each other's side  And fond companions fill our warlike files  For his dear offspring and the wife he loves  The husband and the fearless father arm  In vulgar breasts heroic ardour burns  And the poor peasant mates his darling lord  The cross of Christ  Christian cross  would sound less harsh to the ear what follows is a fine picture of decayed beauty and some judicious sentiments  Lady RANDOLPH  Arise my son in me thou dost behold  The poor remains of beauty once admir'd  The autumn of my days is come already  For sorrow made my summer haste away  Yet in my prime I equall'd not thy father  His eyes were like the eagle's yet sometimes  Liker the dove's and as he pleas'd he won  All hearts with softness or with spirit aw'd  Thou dost not know what perils and injustice  Await the poor man's valour O my son  The noblest blood in all the land's abash'd  Having no lacquey but pale poverty  There burst the smother'd flame  How do bad women find  Unchanging aspects to conceal their guilt  When I by reason and by instinct urg'd  Full hardly can dissemble with these men  In nature's pious cause  The following remark deserves the attention of all men ambitious of the matrimonial state  Lord RANDOLPH  Let no man after me a woman wed  Whose heart he knows he has not tho' she brings  A mine of gold a kingdom for her dowry  GLENALVON  She too that seem'd  Pure  as the  winter stream  when  ice emboss'd  Whitens  its course  This is strained quaint and affected and what follows sheer bombast  He's in a proper mood  To chide the thunder if  it at him roar'd  Glenalvon  is answered with a sensible and manly ingenuity by  Douglas  Sir I have been accustomed all my days  To hear and speak the plain and simple truth  And tho' I have been told that there are men  Who borrow friendship's tongue to speak their scorn  Yet in such language I am little skill'd  Therefore I thank  Glenalvon  for his counsel  Tho' it sounded harshly  GLENALVON  What will become of you  is an unheroic interrogation  Thy truth thou'rt all a lye  This brutality does not meet with an instantaneous and proper retort from one of young  Douglas  's supposed feeling which by the following sentiments is farther manifested  DOUGLAS  To the liege lord of my dear native land  I owe a subject's homage but ev'n him  And his high arbitration I'd reject  Within my bosom reigns another lord  Honour sole judge and umpire of itself  If my free speech offend you noble  Randolph  Revoke your favour and let  Norval  go  Hence as he came alone but not dishonour'd  Imposes silence with a  stilly  sound  What means  stilly  here is it tantamount to  stilling  I know the word is in  Shakespear  but do not understand it in the place he uses it  NORVAL  And  ever  and  anon  they vow'd revenge  Ever  and  anon  are no doubt supposed defensible because in a shepherd's mouth and in imitation of  Homer  's practice are in p faithfully repeated by  Douglas  to his mother  DOUGLAS  May heav'n inspire some fierce gigantic  Dane  To give a bold defiance to our host  Before he speaks it out I will accept  How accept it before he speaks it out Does not this at least border on a blunder  Sad  fear  and  melancholy  still divide  The empire of my breast with  hope  and  joy  This Sir is an abridgment of your Dissertation on the Passions  Lady RANDOLPH  Too well I see  Which way the current of thy temper  sets    Drives  would perhaps be more explicit  The sentiments of dying  Douglas  are not amiss nor is the mother's affliction ill drawn nay somewhat affecting But why she should plunge from a precipice headforemost into the sea I cannot see any reason nor for her or her son's deaths He might have killed  Glenalvon  tho' previously wounded by him in the back but not mortally and lord  Randolph  in expiation of his groundless jealousy and rash attempt resign to victorious  Douglas  his rightful inheritance  The prologue a learned allusion to the old song of  ChevyChase  is of the true  poetical profound  In  ancient times  when  Britain's trade  was arms  Why not  pride  instead of  trade  but the  Scotch  have always sneered at the  English  as a trading nation  And the lov'd music of her youth alarms  The sense of this line not intelligible to us alludes rather to the musical alarms of  Highlan  bagpipes  It would be too much to take in the whole  prologue  here to read it is enough where it emerges from confusion and obscurity it gently subsides in kindred lines to this  They knock'd alternate at each other's gate  It concludes with an humble petition in behalf of  Scotland  The  epilogue  is a priggish affectation and I hope will never be relished by a genuine  British  audience  The farfetched comparison of the  Nile  is stolen I object to the epithet of  celestial  joined to  melancholy  in the last line Heaven by all information I have ever had of it is the kingdom of joy it is therefore a  dissenting  opinion to make it the abode of  melancholy  Why has the panegyrist taken notice but of three performers and natives of  Ireland  shameful partiality This appears a flagrant combination of the  Scotch  and  Irish  against the true sons of old  English  roastbeef as if forsooth the former are only qualified to write tragedy and the latter to perform But to thy teeth partial Analyst I will do my countryfolks the justice they deserve  He who figured in the character of  Glenalvon  manifested a projectile spiritedness of person and strictly adherent to  Horace  's rule  Semper sibi constans  without any variation throughout now this is what may be called supporting a character  The actor of lord  Randolph  was selfcollected having the curb of his passions in hand He exhibited a commanding calmness of deportment and a level stomachfetched dignity of voice  The liquid toned actress of  Anna  irradiated sorrow with her smiles how sweetly did she speak  Thy vassal's grief great nature's order break  And change the noontide to the midnight hour  I should not have been surprised if the superior beings descended from heaven to her pretty manner of uttering this invitation  Ye ministers  Of gracious heav'n who love the human race  Angels and seraphs who delight in goodness  Forsake your skies and to her couch descend  There from her fancy chase those dismal forms  That haunt her waking her sad spirit charm  With images celestial such as please  The bless'd above upon their  golden beds  I owed this to my country so now my mind is at ease  Golden beds  savours of  Epicurism  The groundwork of the play is an absolute absurdity for either the lady  Randolph  must have been very artful who had a chopping boy years before to pass on her husband for a maid or he lord  Randolph  must have been very unacquainted with the affairs of women I fear the latter case and from ineffectual nights sprung the daily cause of her tears and certainly a very material one  Penelope  it is true mourned twenty years for  Ulysses  but then she did not admit an  apathic  lover to tantalize her in bed  The shepherd the jewels and recognition of this doleful piece are wornout devices of the stage and expletive pegs of the human invention  The protracted monotony of lady  Randolph  's grief is irksome One character often exhibited in the same piece must be agitated by variety  of passions otherwise we grow tired of the sameness  After the discovery of  Douglas  he is not thrown into any interesting situation nor is there any dramatic anxiety throughout arising from the intricacy of the plot for from the beginning to the end it is an uninterrupted downhill greensword course entirely against the revolutionary spirit of the scenic laws which perhaps nay by your miscalled dissertation or rather disser+tatiuncle on tragedy it appears you are no  acquainted with We had however a righ  to expect at least unexceptionable correctness of stile in a work by you so immoderately prais+ed not to say profanely  I now take leave of  Douglas  this  aurora bore+alis  of tragedy that had so long corruscated ove  us from the North to execute the last part o  my task to wit to defend Mr  Garrick  by dis+culpating him from a heavy charge disseminated every where from the drawingroom in  St James  to the nightcellars which is that he had th  impudence to refuse  The Tragedy of Douglas  th  best play ever acted not only on the  English  stage but on any other ancient or modern  The author not only absolves but apologis  for Mr  Garrick  by his motto  Non ego sum vates sed prisci conscius avi  "I am not a poet but well read in old ballads"  Mr  Garrick  acquiesced to the former part o  his confession and told him that but poor mat  +rials for the stage could be derived from the la  +ter This is the upshot of his crime Has h  then deserved all the foulmouthed abuse that has been lavished on him I think not who am not partial to him  The pulpit and clergy of  Scotland  are irreverently treated in the  analysis  which ends with a bullying line that might waggishly be retorted to wit  The blood of  Douglas  will  defend  itself  That is people will keep aloof from it because  Nemo impune lacessit  No body rubs to it with impunity  The drift of the whole being now seen thro' with a dislike to your partiality but esteem and veneration for your  genius  and erudition  I am Sir Your c  FINIS
