 Shakespear Illustrated  OR THE NOVELS and HISTORIES On which the PLAYS of SHAKESPEAR Are Founded COLLECTED and TRANSLATED from the ORIGINAL AUTHORS WITH CRITICAL REMARKS In TWO VOLUMES BY THE Author of the FEMALE QUIXOTE  LONDON  Printed for A MILLAR in the  Strand  MDCCLIII  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  JOHN  EARL OF  ORRERY  My  LORD  I Have no other Pretence to the Honour of a Patronage so illustrious as that of your Lordship than  the Merit of attempting what has by some unaccountable Neglect been hitherto omitted though absolutely necessary to a perfect Knowledge of the Abilities of  Shakespear  Among the Powers that must conduce to constitute a Poet the first and most valuable is Invention and of all the Degrees of Invention the highest seems to be that which is able to produce a Series of Events It is easy when the Thread of a Story is once drawn to diversify it with Variety of Colours and when a Train of Action is presented to the Mind a little Acquaintance with Life will supply Circumstances and Reflexions and a little Knowledge of Books furnish Parallels and Illustrations To tell over again a Story that has been told already  and to tell it better than the first Author is no rare Qualification but to strike out the first Hints of a new Fable hence to introduce a Set of Characters so diversified in their several Passions and Interests that from the clashing of this Variety may result many necessary Incidents to make these Incidents surprising and yet natural so as to delight the Imagination without shocking the Judgment of a Reader and finally to wind up the whole in a pleasing Catastrophe produced by those very Means which seem most likely to oppose and prevent it is the utmost Effort of the human Mind  To discover how few of those Writers who profess to recount imaginary Adventures have been able to  produce any Thing by their own Imagination would require too much of that Time which your Lordship employs in nobler Studies Of all the Novels and Romances that Wit or Idleness Vanity or Indigence have pushed into the World there are very few of which the End cannot be conjectured from the Beginning or where the Authors have done more than to transpose the Incidents of other Tales or strip the Circumstances from one Event for the Decoration of another  In the Examination of a Poet's Character it is therefore first to be enquired what Degree of Invention has been exerted by him With this View I have very diligently read the Works of  Shakespear  and now presume to  lay the Result of my Searches before your Lordship before that Judge whom  Pliny  himself would have wished for his Assessor to hear a literary Cause  How much the Translation of the following Novels will add to the Reputation of  Shakespear  or take away from it You my Lord and Men learned and candid like You if any such can be found must now determine Some Danger as I am informed there is lest his Admirers should think him injured by this Attempt and clamour as at the Diminution of the Honour of that Nation which boasts herself the Parent of so great a Poet  That no such Enemies may arise against me though I am unwilling  to believe it I am far from being too confident for who can fix Bounds to Bigotry and Folly My  Sex  my  Age  have not given me many Opportunities of mingling in the World there may be in it many a Species of Absurdity which I have never seen and among them such Vanity as pleases itself with false Praise bestowed on another and such Superstition as worships Idols without supposing them to be Gods  But the Truth is that a very small Part of the Reputation of this mighty Genius depends upon the naked Plot or Story of his Plays He lived in an Age when the Books of Chivalry were yet popular and when therefore the Minds of his Auditors were not accustomed to balance Probabilities or to examine nicely the  Proportion between Causes and Effects It was sufficient to recommend a Story that it was far removed from common Life that its Changes were frequent and its Close pathetic  This Disposition of the Age concurred so happily with the Imagination of  Shakespear  that he had no Desire to reform it and indeed to this he was indebted for the licentious Variety by which he has made his Plays more entertaining than those of any other Author  He had looked with great Attention on the Scenes of Nature but his chief Skill was in Human Actions Passions and Habits he was therefore delighted with such Tales as afforded numerous Incidents and  exhibited many Characters in many Changes of Situation These Characters are so copiously diversified and some of them so justly pursued that his Works may be considered as a Map of Life a faithful Miniature of human Transactions and he that has read  Shakespear  with Attention will perhaps find little new in the crouded World  Among his other Excellencies it ought to be remarked because it has hitherto been unnoticed that his  Heroes are Men  that the Love and Hatred the Hopes and Fears of his chief Personages are such as are common to other human Beings and not like those which later Times have exhibited peculiar to Phantoms that strut upon the Stage  It is not perhaps very necessary to enquire whether the Vehicle of so much Delight and Instruction be a Story probable or unlikely native or foreign  Shakespear  's Excellence is not the Fiction of a Tale but the Representation of Life and his Reputation is therefore safe till Human Nature shall be changed Nor can he who has so many just Claims to Praise suffer by losing that which ignorant Admiration has unreasonably given him To calumniate the Dead is Baseness and to flatter them is surely Folly  From Flattery my Lord either of the Dead or the Living I wish to be clear and have therefore solicited the Countenance of a Patron whom if I knew how to praise  him I could praise with Truth and have the World on my Side whose Candour and Humanity are universally acknowledged and whose Judgment perhaps was then first to be doubted when he condescended to admit this Address from  My Lord  Your Lordship's most obliged and most obedient humble Servant  The  AUTHOR  CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME  THE

History of  Macbeth  Shakespear Illustrated  The fifth Novel of the eighth Decad of the Hecatomythi of  Giraldi Cinthio  _THE  Roman  Empire was at the Heighth of it's Grandeur and Power when  Maximine  a great and virtuous Prince reigned over it this Emperor who desired nothing more ardently than the Welfare and Happiness of all his Subjects was extremely nice in the Choice of those Persons whom he deputed to govern the Provinces dependant on the Empire assigning those Employments only to Men whose Integrity and Virtue were well known to him  It happened that the Government of  Inspruck  a rich and populous City became vacant which the Emperor resolved to bestow upon one of his Officers named  Juriste  a Man whose Fidelity he had often experienced having been several Years near his Person and during that Time had behaved with so much Wisdom and Prudence that he had conceived a great Esteem for him  Having taken this Resolution in Favour of  Juriste  he ordered his Attendance one Day in his Closet and spoke to him as follows  "  Juriste  the good Opinion I have conceived of you from the Manner in which you have behaved yourself since you have been in my Service has determined me to bestow the Government of  Inspruck  upon you I might give you many Directions for your Conduct in this high Employment but I shall confine them all to this one Do Justice to all Persons without any Distinction let this be the Rule and Guide of all your Actions Other Faults which either through Negligence or Ignorance you may happen to commit I possibly may excuse but any Act of Injustice I will never pardon Since it is not given to every Man to be able to practise all the Virtues if you are conscious of any Defect in your Temper which may incline you to act with less Impartiality than I require do not accept of this Government but continue here in my Court where your Services are very agreeable to me and do not lay me under the Necessity of doing what will be very painful  to me which is the punishing you severely for any Act against Justice and thereby acquitting what I myself owe to it"  Juriste  who was greatly pleased with the honourable Employment the Emperor had bestowed upon him thanked his Majesty for it with much Submission "Doubt not my gracious Lord added he but that I will most exactly perform what you require and bend my whole Thoughts towards the Preservation of Justice and so much the more will I make it my continual Study as your Words have kindled a glorious Emulation in my Soul to deserve if possible not your Approbation only but your Praises"  "It is well said the Emperor much pleased with this Reply if your Actions are as good as your Words I shall indeed have great Cause to praise you" then ordering the Letters Patent to be made out he invested  Juriste  with full Authority in his Government and sent him away immediately to take Possession of it  Juriste  as soon as he arrived at  Inspruck  applied himself with great Diligence to the Administration of Justice not only in rewarding Virtue and punishing Vice but in filling all the inferior Posts and Offices with Men of approved Virtue and Wisdom so that by this Conduct he increased the Emperor's Esteem of him and acquired the Love of all the Inhabitants of  Inspruck  In the heighth of his Reputation for Wisdom and Justice it happened that a young Man named  Lodovico  a Citizen of  Inspruck  ravished  a young Maid of the same City her Relations complaining to  Juriste  of this Injury he ordered  Lodovico  to be seized and carried to Prison who confessing the Fact was according to a Law in force there condemned to lose his Head  The unfortunate Youth had a Sister named  Epitia  a Virgin of most exquisite Beauty and but just entered into her sixteenth Year Nature had not only been lavish in the Graces she had bestowed on her Form but endowed her also with a most excellent Understanding which had been well improved by the Study of Philosophy her Father having spared no Expence in the Education of his Children  This Sentence gave great Affliction to  Epitia  who loved her Brother with the most tender Affection reflecting however that her Sorrow was of no Use to her Brother she restrained her Tears and took a Resolution to attempt something to deliver him  For this Purpose she sent to intreat an Audience of the Governor which being granted she appeared before him and throwing herself at his Feet thus spoke to him  "I come my Lord to implore your Compassion for my Brother my only Brother who though he has indeed incurred the Sentence of the Law yet through your milder Justice will I hope find it mitigated Reflect my Lord I beseech you on his early Youth his Inexperience in Life and the Force of that unhappy Passion which caused his Crime reflect also that his Crime though great is not a complicated  one the Honour of no Husband has been injured by it the violated Virgin is the only Person who has been wronged and her Wrong my Brother is willing to repair by making her his Wife I know the Law ordains that the Ravisher although willing to marry the injured Maid shall nevertheless die for the Offence he has committed yet I cannot think my Lord that the Makers of this hard Law designed it to be fulfilled in the very Letter of it Justice overstrained is no longer Justice but Cruelty the Boundaries of Right and Wrong are so near that whoever reaches the Extremity of the one is in Danger of invading the Borders of the other if the Excess of Virtue be Vice the Excess of Justice is Cruelty Mercy is as much the Attribute of Heaven as Justice Here then I beseech you let them be united punish my Brother for his Offence but let that Punishment fall short of Death and do not let loose upon him all the Rigour of a Law that was perhaps rather made to inspire Terror than to be exactly executed let your Wisdom correct it's Severity you whose delegated Power is our living Law and punish not by Death a Crime which may be better repaired by Life"  The beautiful  Epitia  ended here and those Tears which while she was speaking she had with Difficulty restrained now falling fast down her fair Face Sorrow gave so languishing a Sweetness to her Countenance that  Juriste  stood like one entranced his Ears eagerly  taking in the Music of her Accents while his Eyes wandered o'er all the enchanting Beauties of her Form and that he might the longer indulge the Pleasure he felt in hearing and seeing her he obliged her to repeat her former Arguments in her Brother's Favour  Epitia  drawing a good Omen from this Willingness in the Governor to hear her Pleas added many other Persuasions to those she had already used to procure her Brother's Pardon the Hope she began to entertain giving new Grace and Vigour to her Words  Juriste  wholly subdued by the Charms of her Person and the uncommon Strength of her Understanding in a Youth so blooming resolved if possible to win her to his Desires and commit the same Fault with her for which he had condemned her Brother to die  After pausing a little as if reflecting upon what she had said  Epitia  said he your Arguments have so far prevailed upon me that whereas your Brother according to the Sentence of the Law was to lose his Head tomorrow I will defer his Execution till I have well considered what you have urged on his Behalf and if I find your Reasons convincing I will pardon him and so much the more willingly will I do it as I should have been afflicted to have punished him with that Rigour the Law requires  Epitia  full of the pleasing Hope these Words inspired thanked him with much Submission telling him she hoped to find him no less merciful in giving her Brother Pardon than he had been kind in postponing the Execution of the Sentence and  added that she was persuaded if he would consider what she had said he would find Reasons sufficient to induce him to set her Brother at Liberty  Juriste  replied he would fully consider of it and would not fail to comply with her Solicitations provided he could do it without offending Justice  Epitia  greatly pleased with her Success took Leave of the Governor and went to the Prison to visit her Brother to whom she related all that had passed between  Juriste  and her and assured him she did not doubt but she should obtain his Pardon  The unhappy Youth received this News with Transport and earnestly begged his Sister to renew her Visit to the Governor as soon as possible to know his Resolution which she promising they parted each full of the most pleasing Expectations  At the End of three Days she returned to  Juriste  and with a graceful Sweetness demanded to know what he had resolved concerning her Brother This second Sight of the charming Maid added Fuel to the unlawful Flames of  Juriste  who after gazing on her passionately for some Moments took her Hand and thus replied  Lovely  Epitia  I have not failed to consider all the Arguments you used in your Brother's Favour and have also diligently sought for others to enforce them that I might be able to comply with your Request but I find all are insufficient and your Brother is condemned not only by a particular but a universal Law since he knowingly and wilfully  committed a Crime the Punishment of which he knew to be Death his Guilt therefore admits of no Extenuation and notwithstanding the earnest Desire I have to please you I must deliver him up to the Rigour of that Law he has offended There is indeed one Way and but one Way by which you may save your Brother I love you charming  Epitia  give me Possession of your Person and I will change your Brother's Sentence to a Punishment less than Death if you love him you will not scruple to make this small Sacrifice to save his Life which I am resolved not to spare on any other Terms  The fair Face of  Epitia  which at the Beginning of this Speech had been overspread with a languid Paleness glowed with a rosy Blush at the infamous Conclusion her Eyes which had been filled with Tears now darted forth Rays of mingled Rage and Disdain and that sweet Voice that before only uttered the most persuasive Accents was now changed to a severe and haughty Tone  "My Brother's Life said she with a noble Fierceness is indeed very dear to me but my Honour is far dearer my Life I would willingly lose to save his but I will not preserve him with the Loss of my Honour quit then these unworthy Thoughts and if you can pardon my Brother make that Benefit such a Gift as you without Dishonour may bestow and I without Infamy receive"  "I have already told you replied  Juriste  the Terms upon which I will consent to release your Brother nor ought you to think  them hard or dishonourable since it is possible I may be so charmed with your generous Compliance that I may afterwards make you my Wife"  "This improbable Hope replied  Epitia  shall not delude me I will not even bring my Honour into Danger" "Why should you so injuriously doubt the Efficacy of your own Charms replied  Juriste  there is nothing more likely than that I shall marry you go then and consider of my Proposal and tomorrow I will expect your Answer"  "There is no Necessity to consider upon what I have already resolved said  Epitia  I will never be your's on those base Terms but if you set the Liberty of my Brother at the Price of taking you for a Husband I will marry you on Condition that you release him immediately"  "I advise you replied  Juriste  to reflect well on my first Proposal it is in my Power not only to give your Brother Pardon but to be serviceable also to all your Friends and Relations in this Country my Will here is the Law and provided you consent to my Desires you shall command me in all Things"  Saying this he left her and  Epitia  finding there was nothing more to be expected from him oppressed with inconceivable Anguish went to the Prison and related to her Brother all that had past between her and the Governor then melting into Tears she conjured him to submit patiently to an Evil which his own ill Fortune or a sad Necessity had brought upon him  The unhappy Youth burst into a violent Passion of Grief at this cruel and unexpected News and not able to bear the Terrors of approaching Death with the most ardent Supplications he begged his Sister not to leave him in that Extremity  "Can you my  Epitia  said he the Tears fast streaming down his pale Cheeks as he spoke can you endure to have your Brother mangled by the Hands of a base Executioner dragged to a painful Death at these early Years divided from you for ever him who lay in the same Womb with you whom the same Father begot bred up in Infancy together the Partaker of all your childish Sports and in riper Years the Companion of your Studies Oh my Sister are these soft Ties so loosened Does Nature speak so faintly in you that you can abandon me to a shameful Death I have erred I confess you by your superior Wisdom may correct my Errors but do not Oh do not deny me your Assistance in this sad Extremity has not  Juriste  told you that he may possibly make you his Wife and why should you doubt but he will do so Have you not Charms sufficient to engage his Heart to you for ever Nature has made your Person consummately beautiful and blessed you with an Understanding superior to all your Sex every female Grace is yours and every masculine Virtue tempered with a Sweetness which gives you irrestible Attractions Thus adorned can you ought you to fear  Juriste  will not marry you you whom the Emperor of the World might be proud to call Wife  Oh my dear Sister comply with his Proposal and since you have a reasonable Hope of having your Honour repaired by Marriage do not I conjure you cast away the Life of your Brother"  The miserable Youth ending with a new Gush of Tears cast his Arms round the Neck of his weeping Sister and holding her fast folded to his sobbing Bosom would not part from her till vanquished by his Tears and her own Affection which pleaded too strongly for him she promised to consent to what  Juriste  required on Condition that he married her afterwards and gave him a free Pardon  This being concluded on she left her Brother tasting by Anticipation the Joy of recovered Life and returning the next Day to  Juriste  with downcast Looks and faultering Accents she told him that the Desire of delivering her Brother and the Hope which he had given her of making her his Wife had induced her to consent to his Desires but she required a free Pardon for her Brother that he should not only have his Life but an Exemption from any other Punishment which he had incurred by his Offence  Juriste  who now thought himself the happiest Man in the World since he had gained the most lovely and amiable Woman in it to his Will replied "that he confirmed the Hope he had formerly given her to marry her and that if she would pass that Night with him her Brother should be sent home to her in the Morning"  Epitia  reluctantly consenting as soon as the Morning dawned impatient to see her Brother at Liberty disengaged herself from his Arms and reminding him of his Promise to marry her demanded the Liberty of her Brother  Juriste  told her she had obliged him so much by her kind Compliance and his Gratitude for it was so great that he would release her Brother immediately and sent Orders for the Jailer to attend him whom in the Presence of  Epitia  he commanded to send the Brother of that Lady to her House  The Jailer departing  Epitia  took Leave of the Governor eager to embrace her beloved Brother and congratulate him upon the Freedom she had obtained for him and returning home waited for his Arrival with a pleasing Impatience  At length the Jailer appeared followed by two Men who carried a Bier covered with black Cloth which the Jailer taking off discovered the Corpse of the unhappy Youth who had been executed that Morning  No Language can express nor Imagination conceive the Astonishment Grief and Horror which filled the whole Soul of  Epitia  at that cruel Sight motionless like a Statue she stood at the Side of the Bier her Eyes firmly fixed on the still bleeding Trunk and though her Heart was torn with the most agonizing Grief yet not a Tear or Sigh escaped her  After gazing thus for some Moments she raised her Head and turning to the Jailer with dry Eyes and composed Voice "Friend  said she tell thy Lord and mine that such as he has been pleased to send my Brother I have received him and that though he has not gratified my Will yet I am contented since he has satisfied his own thus his Will is mine and I acquiesce in the Justice of the Deed he has performed Tell him also that for the future I shall be always ready to devote myself to his Pleasure"  The Jailer returning to  Juriste  recounted all that  Epitia  had said adding that she discovered no Sign of Discontent at the horrid Present he brought her  Juriste  rejoiced extremely at this News supposing  Epitia  would give him the peaceable Possession of her Person without claiming the Performance of his Promise to marry her since she had not resented the Death of her Brother  But that unhappy Maid whose Thoughts were wholly divided between Grief and the Desire of Revenge no sooner found herself alone than falling in an Extasy of Sorrow on the dead Body of her beloved Brother she shed a River of Tears upon it and closely embracing it in her Arms a Thousand Times she cursed the Cruelty of  Juriste  and her own weak Simplicity that e'er she resigned her Honour she did not oblige him to pay the Price of it by delivering her BrotherNow skrieking aloud and wildly beating her fair Bosom that heaved with unutterable Anguish she contemplated the bleeding Coarse again and rouzed by that sad Spectacle"Wilt thou then  Epitia  said she wilt thou suffer this  Traitor this Barbarian to triumph in the Spoils of thy ruined Honour and the Murder of thy unhappy BrotherShall the complicated Villain live to boast of the Deceit he has practised on theeAh no  Epitia  since thy Simplicity opened the Way to this Deceiver to accomplish his infamous Designs let his guilty Passion afford thee the Means of Revenge It is true my dearest Brother added she addressing herself with a new Flood of Tears to the pale Coarse the Death of thy inhuman Murderer will not restore thee to Life but at least it will be some Alleviation of my Grief that I did not leave thy Death unrevenged  Fixing then upon this Thought and not doubting but  Juriste  would shortly send to her to pass another Night with him she resolved to comply and with a Dagger that she would take secretly along with her murder him when he was asleep and if without Fear of being discovered she could do it to cut off his Head and carrying it to the Tomb of her Brother there offer it to his Ghost  This being resolved upon she expected a Message from him with much Impatience but during that Interval reflecting more maturely upon her Scheme she thought it better to trust the Revenge of her Wrongs to the known Justice of the Emperor than suffer a second Violation and hazard likewise the Success of her Enterprize by undertaking it herself  Being informed that the Emperor was at  Villaco  she went thither in a mourning Habit  and having easily procured an Audience of him she threw herself at his Feet all in Tears "Most sacred Sir said she the base Ingratitude and unequaled Cruelty the Governor of  Inspruck  has used towards me has brought me hither to implore your Justice"Then bending her Eyes to the Ground her fair Face being dyed with Blushes she told the Emperor "that her Brother having been condemned to die to save his Life she had consented to the loose Desires of  Juriste  who had made her Compliance the only Condition of his Pardon but that after he had robbed her of her Honour instead of repairing it as he had promised by Marriage or freeing her Brother which he had sworn to do he sent his dead Body to her the next Morning"  Epitia  could not recal this mournful Image to her Mind without relapsing into so violent an Agony of Grief that the Emperor and the Lords who were about him were at once struck with Astonishment Horror and Compassion  Maximine  though he was greatly moved having given one Ear to  Epitia  reserved the other for  Juriste  and raising the fair Mourner from the Ground he dismiss'd her to repose and sent immediate Orders to  Juriste  to appear before him charging his Messenger and all who had heard  Epitia  's Complaint upon pain of his Displeasure not to give any intimation of it to  Juriste  The cruel Governor who had not the least Suspicion of what had happened obeyed the  Emperor's Commands with great Chearfulness and presenting himself before him with all the Assurance of conscious Innocence desired to know his sacred Pleasure  You shall be informed of it immediately said the Emperor then turning to some of his Attendants he ordered them to bring  Epitia  into his Presence  Juriste  when he beheld the unhappy Lady whom he had so cruelly injured now subdued for the first Time by the Stings of Conscience his vital Spirits almost forsook him an ashy Paleness overspread his Face and an universal trembling seized his whole Body  The Emperor who beheld these Signs of Guilt no longer doubted but that all  Epitia  had said was true and beholding him with a furious Look "Listen said he to the Complaint this Lady has to make against you" and then commanded  Epitia  to relate her Story  She accordingly obeyed and recounted all the Particulars of  Juriste  's Baseness and Ingratitude to her and concluding with Tears demanded Justice of the Emperor  Juriste  hearing this Accusation approached  Epitia  and thinking to sooth her said "Could I ever have believed  Epitia  that you whom I have so much loved would come hither to accuse me to the Emperor"  Maximine  who would not suffer him to use any of his Arts to soften the injur'd Maid interrupted him sternly "This is no Time for you to play the passionate Lover said he  Answer to the Crimes she charges you with"  Juriste  finding that his Blandishments would be of no Use to him left  Epitia  and replied "'Tis true my Lord I condemned the Brother of this Lady to lose his Head for having forcibly violated the Chastity of a Virgin this being the Punishment the Law had provided for his Crime and in causing the Sentence to be executed upon him I only obeyed your Majesty's Commands who above all Things recommended to me the strict Administration of Justice which must have been injured had I suffer'd him to remain alive"  "Since the Preservation of Justice was the Motive of your Actions replied  Epitia  why did you violate it by promising to grant my Brother his Pardon and by means of that Promise which you did not perform and the Hope you had given me of taking me for your Wife which you have neglected to fulfil rob me of my Honour if my Brother for a small Crime merited all the Severity of the Law surely you deserve it whose Guilt is much greater than his was"  Juriste  having nothing to say in excuse of himself continued silent"And is it thus then said the Emperor to  Juriste  that thou dost administer Justice but never more shall it be in thy Power to act such Villanies nor shalt thou escape unpunished depend upon it"  Juriste  now began to implore Mercy while  Epitia  on the other Hand loudly demanded JusticeThe Emperor who had well considered the Simplicity of  Epitia  and the  great Wickedness of  Juriste  cast in his Mind how he might repair her Honour and yet do Justice on the Governor and after some Pause he declared his Intention of obliging  Juriste  to marry her  The Lady however refused to consent to it saying "she could not think of becoming the Wife of a Man who had murdered her Brother and betrayed her" but the Emperor would be obeyed and they were immediately married  Juriste  now thought he had no more to fear when the Emperor permitting  Epitia  to retire to her Lodgings turned towards  Juriste  who still remained in his Presence and said "Two Crimes hast thou committed each of which deserves a most rigorous Punishment First by a most detestable Artifice violating the Chastity of an unhappy Girl and Secondly breaking the Faith thou hadst given her by putting her Brother to death For the first Injury I have provided some Recompence by making thee marry the deceived Lady and for the Second I condemn thee to lose thy Head as thou madest her Brother to lose his"  The Horror of  Juriste  at this unexpected Sentence may be easier imagined than described it was in vain for him to sue for Mercy the Emperor was determined and he was led away to Prison in order to be executed the next Morning  Juriste  no longer hoping for Pardon disposed himself to meet patiently the Death he had so well deserved when  Epitia  being informed of the Sentence that had been past upon  him hastened to Court and intreating another Audience of the Emperor as soon as she was admitted to his Presence throwing herself at his Feet she said "Most sacred Sir the Cruelty and Injustice  Juriste  used towards me moved me to come to your Majesty and implore Justice for the double Wrong I received from him which you have most graciously granted my violated Chastity you have repaired by obliging him to marry me and for my Broth  r's Death contrary to his solemn Promise you have condemned him to die As a violated Maid as an injured Sister I then demanded Justice on him but as his Wife I now implore Mercy Consider sacred Sir this new Obligation was imposed on me by you his Death was before due to my Wrongs his Life is now become my Care through the Engagements you have made me enter into with him To repair my Honour you gave him to me for a Husband if he dies by my Accusation your Majesty's most generous Intentions will not avail me since the World will brand my Name with Infamy and Cruelty Oh let not the Sword of Justice thus miserably cut the Knot you have so lately tied grant my Husband's Life to my Prayers let your Clemency equal your Justice and in the Use of both be like the Immortals themselves"  Epitia  ended here and the Emperor seiz'd with Astonishment and Admiration at the Greatness of her Mind thought he could do no less than grant the Demand she so generously made and sending immediately for  Juriste  he said "Wickedly as thou hast acted towards this Lady yet such is her Generosity and unequalled Goodness that she has solicited no less ardently for thy Pardon than if thou hadst never offended her I give thee Life then but know thou owest that Life to her Mediation and if she is willing since I have made thee her Husband to live with thee as such I consent it should be so but take care to treat her with the utmost Tenderness for if I ever hear that thou dost otherwise thou shalt feel the severest Effects of my Displeasure"  The Emperor in finishing these Words took  Epitia  's Hand and gave it to  Juriste  who with his Wife falling at  Maximine  's Feet gave him Thanks for the great Goodness he had shewn them and  Juriste  reflecting on the unmerited Kindness and Generosity of  Epitia  ever loved her with the most ardent Affection and lived happily with her to the End of his Days  From the foregoing Story of  Juriste  and  Epitia Shakespear  took the Plot of  Measure for Measure  The Incidents in the Novel are fewer and less complex than in the Play but the Subject in both is the same  The Fable of  MEASURE FOR MEASURE  VINCENTIO  Duke of  Vienna  being resolved to have some severe Edicts revived which had lain dormant during a great Number of Years declares his Intention of leaving his Dominions for some Time and makes  Angelo  a Nobleman of severe Life and austere Manners his Deputy in his Absence The Duke instead of leaving  Vienna  privately repaires to a Convent and there discloseing his Design of spying into the Actions of the Deputy and People to a Friar he engages him to procure a Habit of the Order for his Disguise and instruct him as he phrases it  How he may formally in Person bear like a true Friar  Angelo  begins his Administration by causing  Claudio  a young Gentleman who had deluded a Virgin to be arrested on an old Act by which it was provided that the Man who committed such a Crime should die and accordingly he signs a Warrant for his Execution  Escalus  an old Lord very much beloved by the Duke and who had been deputed by him to bear a subordinate Part in the Administration endeavours to prevail with  Angelo  to soften the Severity of this Sentence but in vain  The Sister of  Claudio  a beautiful young Virgin and a Novice in the Convent of St  Clair  solicits  Angelo  for her Brother's Pardon he denies her but afterwards being enamoured of her Beauty promises to grant her Request upon Condition she gives him Possession of her Person  Isabella  with great Disdain refuses to purchase her Brother's Life upon these shameful Terms goes to the Prison and acquaints  Claudio  with her ill Success the Youth fond of Life intreats her to save him and comply with the Deputy's Request She after reproaching him severely for his Baseness quits him in great Rage  The Duke who in the Disguise of a Friar was come to visit and exhort the Prisoners having overheard all that had passed between  Isabella  and her Brother intreats some private Discourse with her she consents and he informs her that  Angelo  some Years before had been contracted in Marriage to a young Lady named  Mariana  whom he forsook because her Fortune was lost at Sea and to colour his Perfidy gave out that he left her on Account of her Unchastity he then advises her in order to save her Brother's Life to go to the Deputy and tell him that she will consent to the Conditions he had proposed to her  and in the mean Time he would prevail upon  Mariana  who still loved  Angelo  secretly to supply her Place by which Means her Brother's Pardon would be obtained without the Loss of her Honour  This Contrivance is put in Execution but  Angelo  notwithstanding his Promise to the contrary sends a new Order to the Provost of the City for the Execution of  Claudio  and commands him to bring him his Head  The Duke wholly taken up with the Affairs of the Prison is soon informed of this unexpected Event he prevails with the Provost to delay the Execution of  Claudio  and to deceive the Deputy by cutting off the Head of a Pirate who died in the Prison and presenting it to him for  Claudio  's  Isabella  coming to the Prison to know if her Brother's Pardon had been sent is told by the disguised Duke that he was executed early that Morning pursuant to a new Order from  Angelo  Isabella  raves and threatens the counterfeit Friar advises her to complain of  Angelo  to the Duke who was that Day expected to return to  Vienna  The Duke then shifting his Dress enters the City attended by  Angelo  and  Escalus  whom he had commanded to meet him  Isabella  falling on her Knees demands Justice on  Angelo  for having deluded her of her Honour under Pretence of saving her Brother's Life and afterwards causing him to be executed  The Friar who was in the Secret declares  Isabella  spoke an Untruth for that she was absolutely unviolated by  Angelo  Mariana  is then introduced who in an enigmatical Manner declares herself to have been the Person who supplied  Isabella  's Place with  Angelo  and claims him for her Husband  Angelo  denies all  The Duke then slipping away resumes the Habit of a Friar and after some Reflexions on the Government he is ordered by the Deputy to be carried to Prison and being seized by a wild young Fellow his Hood falls off and he is discovered to be the Duke  Angelo  hereupon confesses his Crime the Duke orders him to marry  Mariana  immediately which being done he condemns him to Death At the Intercession of  Mariana  and  Isabella  he is pardoned and the Duke charmed with the Virtue and Beauty of  Isabella  offers himself to her for a Husband  The rest is all Episode made up of the extravagant Behaviour of a wild Rake the Blunders of a drunken Clown and the Absurdities of an ignorant Constable  There are a greater Diversity of Characters and more Intrigues in the Fable of the Play than the Novel of  Cinthio  yet I think whereever  Shakespear  has invented he is greatly below the Novelist since the Incidents he has added are neither necessary nor probable  The Story of  Juriste  and  Epitia  of itself afforded a very affecting Fable for a Play it is only faulty in the Catastrophe The Reader who cannot but be extremely enraged at the Deceit and Cruelty of  Juriste  and very desirous of his meeting with a Punishment due to his Crime is greatly disappointed to find him  in the End not only pardoned but made happy in the Possession of the beautiful  Epitia  Shakespear  though he has altered and added a good deal yet has not mended the Moral for he also shews Vice not only pardoned but left in Tranquility  The cruel the vicious and hypocritical  Angelo  marries a fair and virtuous Woman who tenderly loved him and is restored to the Favour of his Prince  I said before that the Story of  Juriste  and  Epitia  afforded an affecting Subject for a Play and it is to be wished since  Shakespear  thought proper to found one upon it that he had left the Fable simple and entire as it was without loading it with useless Incidents unnecessary Characters and absurd and improbable Intrigue  Thus it would have stood by keeping close to the Novelist A young Gentleman vanquished by the Force of a too violent Passion ravishes a Virgin whom he is afterwards willing to marry but is seiz'd and condemn'd to die for his Crime his Sister a beautiful Maid who tenderly loves the unfortunate Youth solicits the rigid Governor for his Pardon which he refuses unless she sacrifices her Honour to him The Lady rejects his Proposal with Disdain but subdued by the affecting Tears and Prayers of a Brother whose Life is dearer to her than her own she reluctantly consents to the Governor's Proposal on Condition that he should give her Borther a free Pardon and repair her Honour hereafter by Marriage  The Governor binds himself by Oath to perform both these Conditions which Oath he breaks after the unfortunate Lady had paid the Price of them and sends an immediate Order for her Brother's Execution  The Lady in the violence of her Grief and Rage resolves to murder him with her own Hands but reflecting that she could not take this Revenge on him without subjecting herself to a second Violation she complains of her Wrongs to her Sovereign and demands Justice on the impious Perpetrator of them  The Emperor in order to repair her Honour obliges the perfidious Governor to marry her and then commands him to be led to Execution which she by an exalted Piece of Generosity opposes and as his Wife kneels and solicits ardently for his Pardon which the Emperor at last grants  Here the Novelist should be dropt and the Catastrophe according to poetical Justice might be thus wound up  The Lady having performed her Duty in saving the Life of a Man who however unworthy was still her Husband should devote herself to a Cloister for the remainder of her Life and the wretched  Juriste  deprived of his Dignity in Disgrace with his Prince and the Object of Universal Contempt and Hatred to compleat his Miseries he should feel all his former Violence of Passion for  Epitia  renewed and falling into an Excess of Grief for her Loss since the Practice is allowed by Christian Authors stab himself in De pair  The Fable thus manag'd takes in as great a Variety of Incidents as with Propriety can be introduced in a Play and those Incidents naturally rising out of one another and all dependant on the principal Subject of the Drama forms that Unity of Action which the Laws of Criticism require  This Fable also would not be destitute of a Moral which as  Shakespear  has managed it is wholly wanting The fatal Consequence of an irregular Passion in  Claudio  the Danger of endeavouring to procure Good by indirect Means in  Isabella  and the Punishment of lawless Tyranny in the Governor convey Instruction equally useful and just  Since the Fable in  Cinthio  is so much better contrived than that of  Measure for Measure  on which it is founded the Poet sure cannot be defended for having altered it so much for the worse and it would be but a poor Excuse for his want of Judgment to say that had he followed the Novelist closer his Play would have been a Tragedy and to make a Comedy he was under a Necessity of winding up the Catastrophe as he has done  The comic Part of  Measure for Measure  is all Episode and has no Dependance on the principal Subject which even as  Shakespear  has managed it has none of the Requisites of Comedy great and flagrant Crimes such as those of  Angelo  in  Measure for Measure  are properly the Subject of Tragedy the Design of which is to shew the fatal Consequences of those Crimes and the Punishment that never fails to attend them The light Follies  of a  Lucio  may be exposed ridiculed and corrected in Comedy  That  Shakespear  made a wrong Choice of his Subject since he was resolved to torture it into a Comedy appears by the low Contrivance absurd Intrigue and improbable Incidents he was obliged to introduce in order to bring about three or four Weddings instead of one good Beheading which was the Consequence naturally expected  The Duke who it must be confess'd has an excellent plotting Brain gives it out that he is going  incog  to  Poland  upon weighty Affairs of State and substitutes  Angelo  to govern till his Return to Friar  Thomas  his Confidant however he imparts his true Design which is in his Absence to have some severe Laws revived that had been long disused Methinks this Conduct is very unworthy of a good Prince if he thought it fit and necessary to revive those Laws why does he commit that to another which it was his Duty to perform  The Friar's Answer is very pertinent  It rested in your Grace  T' unloose this tiedup Justice when you pleas'd  And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd  Than in Lord  Angelo  The Duke replies  I do fear too dreadful  In short the poor Duke is afraid to exert his own Authority by enforcing those Laws notwithstanding he thinks them absolutely necessary and therefore as he says  I have on  Angelo  imposed the Office  Who may in the Ambush of my Name strike home  However in Fact it is the Duke who strikes in the Ambush of  Angelo  's Name for it is he who causes  Angelo  to put those severe Laws in Execution while he skulks in Concealment to observe how they are received if ill  Angelo  must stand the Consequence if well he will enjoy the Merit of it And in order to discover how Things are carried on in the Commonwealth he makes the Friar procure him a Habit of the Order and thus disguised where does he go Why to the common Jail among the condemned Malefactors His Speculations are wholly confined to this Scene  Here entirely taken up with the Affairs of the Prisoners his Highness ambles backwards and forwards from the Prison to  Mariana  's House fetching and carrying Messages contriving how to elude those very Laws he had been so desirous of having executed corrupting one of the principal of his Magistrates and teaching him how to deceive his Delegate in Power  How comes it to pass that the Duke is so well acquainted with the Story of  Mariana  to whom  Angelo  was betrothed but abandoned by him on Account of the Loss of her Fortune She speaks of the Duke as of a Person she had been long acquainted with  Mariana  Here comes a Man of Comfort whose Advice  Hath often still'd my brawling Discontent  Yet this could only happen while he assumed the Character of a Friar which  s but for two or three Days at most he  d not possibly have been acquainted with  Story before if he had the Character of  Angelo  would have been also known to him and consequently it was unnecessary to make him his Deputy in order to try him further which was one of his Reasons as he tells Friar  Thomas  for concealing himself  If it is granted that the Duke could not know  Mariana  's Affair before his Disguise what Opportunities had he of learning it afterwards For notwithstanding what  Mariana  says which intimates a long Acquaintance it is certain it could have been but a very short one some extraordinary Accident therefore must have brought her Story to his Knowledge which we find was known to no one else for  Angelo  's Reputation for Sanctity was very high and that could not have been if his Wrongs to  Mariana  were publickly known  But why does not the Poet acquaint us with this extraordinary Accident which happens so conveniently for his Purpose If he is accountable  to our Eyes for what he makes us see is he not also accountable to our Judgment for what he would have us believe But in short without all this Jumble of Inconsistencies the Comedy would have been a downright Tragedy for  Claudio  's Head must have been cut off if  Isabella  had not consented to redeem him and the Duke would have wanted a Wise if such a convenient Person as  Mariana  had not been introduced to supply her Place and save her Honour  As the Character of the Duke is absurd and ridiculous▪ that of  Angelo  is inconsistent to the last Degree his Baseness to  Mariana  his wicked Attempts on the Chastity of  Isabella  his villainous Breach of Promise and Cruelty to  Claudio  prove him to be a very bad Man long practised in Wickedness yet when he finds himself struck with the Beauty of  Isabella  he starts at the Temptation reasons on his Frailty asks Assistance from Heaven to overcome it resolves against it and seems carried away by the Violence of his Passion to commit what his better Judgment abhors  Are these the Manners of a sanctified Hypocrite such as  Angelo  is represented to be Are they not rather those of a good Man overcome by a powerful Temptation That  Angelo  was not a good Man appears by his base Treatment of  Mariana  for certainly nothing can be viler than to break his Contract with a Woman of Merit because she had accidentally become poor and to excuse his own Conduct load the unfortunate Innocent with base Aspersions and add Infamy to her  other Miseries Yet this is the Man who when attacked by a Temptation kneels prays expostulates with himself and while he scarce yields in Thought to do wrong his Mind feels all the Remorse which attends actual Guilt  It must be confessed indeed that  Angelo  is a very extraordinary Hypocrite and thinks in a Manner quite contrary from all others of his Order for they as it is natural are more concerned for the Consequences of their Crimes than the Crimes themselves whereas he is only troubled about the Crime and wholly regardless of the Consequences  The Character of  Isabella  in the Play seems to be an Improvement upon that of  Epitia  in the Novel for  Isabella  absolutely refuses and persists in her Refusal to give up her Honour to save her Brother's Life whereas  Epitia  overcome by her own Tenderness of Nature and the affecting Prayers of the unhappy Youth yields to what her Soul abhors to redeem him from a shameful Death It is certain however that  Isabella  is a mere Vixen in her Virtue how she rates her wretched Brother who gently urges her to save him  Isabella  Oh you Beast  Oh faithless Coward Oh dishonest Wretch  Wilt thou be made a Man out of my Vice  Is't not a Kind of Incest to take Life  From thine own Sister's Shame What shou'd I think  Heav'n grant my Mother play'd my Father fair  For such a warp'd Slip of Wilderness  Ne'er issued from his Blood Take my Defiance  Die perish Might my only bending down  Reprieve thee from thy Fate it should proceed  I'll pray a thousand Prayers for thy Death  No Word to save thee  Claudio  Nay hear me  Isabella  Isabella  Oh fie fie fie  Thy Sin's not accidental but a Trade  Mercy to thee wou'd prove itself a Bawd  'Tis best that thou dy'st quickly  Is this the Language of a modest tender Maid one who had devoted herself to a religious Life and was remarkable for an exalted Understanding and unaffected Piety in the earliest Bloom of Life  From her Character her Profession and Degree of Relation to the unhappy Youth one might have expected mild Expostulations wise Reasonings and gentle Rebukes his Desire of Life though purchased by Methods he could not approve was a natural Frailty which a Sister might have pitied and excused and have made use of her superior Understanding to reason down his Fears recal nobler Ideas to his Mind teach him what was due to her Honour and his own and reconcile him to his approaching Death by Arguments drawn from that Religion and Virtue of which she made so high a Profession but that Torrent  of abusive Language those coarse and unwomanly Reflexions on the Virtue of her Mother her exulting Cruelty to the dying Youth are the Manners of an affected Prude outragious in her seeming Virtue not of a pious innocent and tender Maid  I cannot see the Use of all that juggling and Ambiguity at the winding up of the Catastrophe  Isabella  comes and demands Justice of the Duke for the Wrongs she had received from his Deputy declaring she had sacrificed her Innocence to save her Brother's Life whom  Angelo  had notwithstanding his Promise to the contrary caused to be executed  Upon the Duke's telling her that he believed her Accusation to be false she goes away in Discontent without saying a Word more Is this natural Is it probable that  Isabella  would thus publicly bring a false Imputation on her Honour and though innocent and unstained suffer the World to believe her violatedShe knows not that the honest Friar who advised her to this extraordinary Action is the Duke to whom she is speaking she knows not how the Matter will be cleared up  She who rather chose to let her Brother die by the Hands of an Executioner than sacrifice her Virtue to save his Life takes undeserved Shame to herself in public without procuring the Revenge she seeks after  Mariana  's evasive Deposition Friar  Peter  's enigmatical Accusation of  Isabella    the Duke's winding Behaviour what does it all serve for but to perplex and embroil plain Facts and make up a Riddle without a Solution  The Reader can easily discover how the Plot will be unravelled at last but the unnecessary Intricacies in unravelling it still remain to be accounted for  The Play sets out with the Moral in the Title  Measure for Measure  but how is this made out the Duke speaking of  Angelo  to  Isabella  says  but as a Judge  Being doubly Criminal in Violation  Of sacred Chastity and of Promise Breach  Thereon dependant for your Brother's Life  The very Mercy of the Law cries out  Most audible even from his proper Tongue  An  Angelo  for  Claudio  Death for Death  Haste still pays Haste and Leisure answers Leisure  Like doth quit Like and  Measure  still for  Measure  Thus it should have been according to the Duke's own Judgment to have made it  Measure for Measure  but when  Angelo  was pardoned and restored to Favour how then was it  Measure for Measure  The Case is not altered because  Claudio  was not put to death and  Isabella  not violated it was not through  Angelo  's Repentance that both these Things did not happen a Woman  he was engaged to supplied the Place of  Isabella  and the Head of another Man was presented to him instead of  Claudio  's  Angelo  therefore was intentionally guilty of perverting Justice debauching a Virgin and breaking his Promise in putting her Brother to death whose Life she had bought by that Sacrifice  Isabella  when pleading for him says  My Brother had but Justice  In that he did the Thing for which he dy'd  For  Angelo  his Act did not o'ertake his bad Intent  And must be buried but as an Intent  That perish'd by the Way Thoughts are no Subjects  Intents but meerly Thoughts  This is strange Reasoning of  Isabella  her Brother deserved Death she says because  he did the Thing for which he died  he intended to do it and his doing it was the Consequence of his Intention  Angelo  likewise intended to debauch her and murder her Brother and he did both in Imagination that it was only Imagination was not his Fault for so he would have had it and so he thought it was It is the Intention which constitutes Guilt and  Angelo  was guilty in Intention and for what he knew in fact therefore as far as lay in his Power he was as guilty as  Claudio  This Play therefore being absolutely defective in a due Distribution of Rewards and  Punishments  Measure for Measure  ought not to be the Title since Justice is not the Virtue it inculcates nor can  Shakespear  's Invention in the Fable be praised for what he has altered from  Cinthio  is altered greatly for the worse  The Ninth Novel of  Bandello  Volume the Second  _WHEN the  Scaligers  were Lords of  Verona  a fierce and bloody Enmity subsisted between two noble Families of that City of greater Dignity and Riches than the rest the Name of the one was  Montecchio  the other  Capellet  This violent Hatred was the Cause of frequent bloody Engagements between the Relations and Dependants of those two Lords and the Numbers that were killed of both Parties on these Occasions kept up and augmented the Fury of their several Descendants  Bartholomew Scaliger  then at the Head of this Republic laboured with the utmost Diligence to suppress these Disorders but all his Cares could never wholly prevent them so deeply was their Hatred of each other rooted in their Bosoms  Finding it impossible to entirely reconcile them in order to put an End to the Affronts which each Party gave and received from the other and which was always followed by the Deaths of some amongst them he commanded that the youngest of one Faction should always give Way to the eldest of the other whenever they happened to meet by which Means many Disorders were avoided  About this Time  Romeo  the young Heir of the  Montecchio  Family was violently enamoured of a Lady in  Verona  who notwithstanding the extraordinary Beauty and Accomplishments he was possest of treated him with great Disdain  Romeo  during two Years pursued the inexorable Beauty employing all the Rhetoric of Sighs Tears Presents and Entertainments to move her Heart but all in vain his Friends who saw him languish out his Days in a hopeless Passion were greatly alarmed but neither their Remonstrances or Intreaties were able to effect his Cure  One of his Companions who was dearer to him than the rest greatly afflicted to behold him losing thus the Vigour of Youth in following a Woman without Hopes of obtaining her often took Occasion to blame his Perseverance  Romeo  said he one Day to him I love you as my Brother and it gives me great Pain to see you thus consume away like Snow melting in the Sun don't you see you waste your Time and spend your Fortune without obtaining either Honour or Advantage Your  Endeavours to win this Woman are all ineffectual the more you sollicit her the more rigid she becomes certainly it is a great Folly to attempt a Thing which is not only difficult to do but impossible you may be convinced she neither cares for you or any Thing you can do to please her perhaps she has some other Lover who is so dear to her she would not quit him for an Emperor You are young my dear  Romeo  your Person is more lovely than any Youth's in this City you are let me speak it since it is Truth to your Face you are generous virtuous and elegant to these amiable Qualities are added the more solid Advantages of Learning and Wit You are the only Son of one of the greatest and richest of our Noblemen does he restrain you in your Expences does he controul you in your Pleasures Is he not your Factor only to take Care of your Affairs while you spend your Time as you please Awake I conjure you and begin to reflect at length upon the Error you have been guilty of remove from your Eyes the Veil which blinds you and hinders you from seeing the Path you are pursuing resolve to place your Affection on some Person more deserving and chuse a Lady who will better reward your Love a just Indignation is often more powerful in the Heart than Love itself Now when Assemblies and Masquerades are held all over this great City mix with the Company every where and when you meet the ungrateful Woman you have solicited so long gaze not on her Face but reflect on her Injustice her Cruelty and her Pride do not doubt but the many Injuries  you have suffered will excite an Indignation so just and reasonable that your Passion will in Time yield to its Force and you by Degrees regain your Liberty  To these Reasons the faithful Friend of  Romeo  added many others to engage him to quit his unsuccessful Pursuit  Romeo  listened to him with Attention and took a Resolution immediately to put his wise Councils in Practice  The Feast being now begun he had frequent Opportunities of meeting the scornful Maid but he always carefully avoided looking at her gazing on the other Ladies and anxiously examining the Beauties of every one to chuse her who was most agreeable to him  About this Time  Antonio Capellet  the Head of that Family made a magnificent Feast to which he invited a great many of the chief Nobility and Ladies most of the Youth of Quality being there  Romeo  notwithstanding the long continued Hatred between their Families came thither also at Night being masqued like the rest of the Company but soon after throwing it off as all the others did he seated himself at one Corner of the Hall which by the great Number of Torches being made as light as Day he could conveniently behold the whole Assembly  Romeo  soon drew the Eyes of the Company upon him and of the Ladies particularly who struck with his Boldness in coming to that House could not conceal their Admiration of it his Enemies however on Account of his Youth his extraordinary Beauty the Sweetness  of his Manners and the almost universal Love he had acquired forbore to give him any Disturbance which perhaps had he been elder and less amiable they might have done  Romeo  therefore having leisure to consider the Beauty of the Ladies that were at the Feast began to praise them more or less according to his Taste and without dancing himself took a Pleasure in looking upon those that did While he was thus employed he saw a young Lady of most exquisite Beauty whose Name was unknown to him his Heart immediately confessed this Object to be more charming than any he had ever seen he gazed on her attentively and the longer he gazed the more Beauty and Graces he discovered in her Finding an unusual Pleasure in contemplating her he was not able for a Moment to remove his Eyes from her Face but darting a thousand passionate Looks at the young Beauty he secretly resolved to exert his utmost Endeavours to gain her Affections  Thus was his former Passion vanquished by this new one and gave Place to a Flame that was never extinguished but by his Death Not daring in that suspected House to enquire the Name of the young Beauty that had charmed him he contented himself with feeding his Eyes with her Sight and finding new Graces in every Look and Action drank in large Draughts of the sweet Poison of Love  Romeo  being as was said before seated in a Corner of the Hall had a full View of all the Company who in returning to their  Places after Dancing passed close by him  Julietta  so was the young Lady called who had charmed him not having observed him before was struck with Admiration of his Person as she went by the Place where he sat This fair One was Daughter to  Capellet  the Master of the House who had given the Feast and ignorant of the Name and Quality of  Romeo  yet he appearing to her the most beautiful Youth she had ever seen she could not resist the Pleasure she took in gazing on him but secretly snatching stolen Glances at him every Moment an unusual Softness took Possession of her Heart and filled it with all the sweet Inquietudes and tender Perplexities of a begining Passion Not satisfied with gazing on him at a Distance she ardently wished he would mix among the Dancers that she might have an Opportunity of hearing him speak not doubting but her Ears would take in as much Pleasure from the Agreeableness of his Discourse as her Eyes did Sweetness from his Sight but  Romeo  wholly lost in the Pleasure he took in looking upon her shewed no Inclination to join the Company and  Julietta  was equally incapable of any Delight but looking at him  Their Eyes being thus frequently directed to each other their passionate Glances often met the Sighs which accompanied those Glances betrayed the Emotions of their Hearts and both were sensible that an Opportunity of discovering their mutual Flame was equally desired by each  While they were thus taken up in exchanging tender and passionate Looks the Ball broke up and the Company mixing promiscuously together began the concluding Dance called  the Dance of the Torch  otherwise  the Dance of the Hat  Romeo  in the midst of the agreeable Confusion of this Dance was snatched up by a Lady who forcing him into the Croud he performed his Part and giving the Torch as was the Custom to another Lady he drew near to  Julietta  and took her by the Hand to the inconceivable Transport of them both  Julietta  then seating herself between  Romeo  and  Mercutio  the latter who was a Courtier gay witty and agreeably satirical was as remarkable for the extraordinary Coldness of his Hand as for the uncommon Sprightliness of his Disposition and he holding one of  Julietta  's Hands as  Romeo  did the other she who ardently desired to hear him speak turning towards him with an inchanting Smile said softly and in a trembling Voice gently pressing his Hand at the same Moment "Blessed be the Time Sir that you seated yourself near me"  Romeo  who well knew how to make use of Advantages straining her Hand passionately in return with Eyes which seemed to implore her Pity and an Accent as if his Life hung suspended on her Answer asked her the Meaning of such a Benediction  "Gentle Youth replied  Julietta  with a Smile I bless the Time of your coming hither because Signior  Mercutio  whose Hand  is as cold as Ice froze me all over by his Touch and you for which I am much obliged to you by the kindly Warmth of yours have restored me again"  "Madam replied  Romeo  immediately I should think myself superlatively happy in being able to do you any Service and blest beyond Measure if you will deign to command me as the meanest of your Servants permit me however to tell you that if my Hand has warmed you the Fire of your bright Eyes has kindled such Flames in me that unless you afford me some Assistance I shall soon be consumed to Ashes"  Scarce had he finished these last Words when the Dance being ended the Company began to disperse and  Julietta  transported with the Excess of her new Passion breathing an ardent Sigh and tenderly straining his Hand replied in haste as she parted from him "Alass what can I say but that I am more yours than my own"  Romeo  in Hopes of knowing who she was continued still in the Hall but he had not waited long 'till he was informed by a Friend that she was the Daughter of the Lord  Capellet  who had given the Feast  This News threw him into great Affliction foreseeing the Difficulty and Danger there would be in pursuing his Passion but the Wound was already given and his whole Soul was now infected with the sweet Venom of Love  On the other Side  Julietta  equally desirous of knowing the Name of him who had conquered  her Heart calling an old Woman who had nursed her to a Window which looked into a Street through which the Company was passing by the Light of a great Number of Torches she began to enquire the Names of several of the Masquers as they went along and at last directing her Eyes to  Romeo  asked her who that fine Youth was who carried his Masque in his Hand The good Woman who knew him very well told her it was  Romeo  Son of the Lord  Montecchio  Julietta  struck with the Sound of that Name as with a Thunderbolt began now to despair of ever gaining the Object of her Affections for a Husband Concealing however her Confusion from the Observation of her Nurse she retired to Bed but her Mind was agitated with so many different Thoughts that she could take no Repose Love and Despair bred a cruel Conflict in her Soul yet Love had taken so full and absolute Possession of it that her Desire increased with the Impossibility of gratifying it "Ah cried she to herself how have I suffered my Affections to be thus transported how do I know credulous Fool as I am whether  Romeo  really loves me Perhaps the artful Youth means only to delude me with a dissembled Passion that by robbing me of my Honour he may revenge himself of my Family and encrease the rooted Hatred between our Fathers but can it be that a Soul so generous as his should form a Design to ruin one who loves and adores him Ah if the Face be the Index of the Mind  his is all Loveliness and Beauty Cruelty and Deceit can never harbour in so sweet a Dwelling from a Form so inchanting nothing can be expected but Truth Gentleness and Love But suppose added she that he loves me honourably have I not Reason to believe that my Father will never consent to our Union and yet who knows but our mutual Passion may be the Means of procuring a firm and perpetual Peace between our Families I have often heard that not only the Peace of private Families has been procured by Marriages but that warring Nations have been made Friends by that Means ought I not then to hope that our two Houses may be reconciled by such an Event" Resting then upon this soothing Thought whenever  Romeo  went through the Street where she lived she always shewed herself at a Balcony giving him such bewitching Smiles as he passed as filled his whole Soul which like hers had been tost between Hope and Fear with inexpressible Delight  It was not without great Danger to his his Person that he thus haunted the Street where she dwelt both Night and Day but  Julietta  's Smiles inflaming his Desires he could not resist the sweet Violence that drew him continually thither the Chamber of this fair Maid had a Window in it which looked into a narrow Lane  Romeo  when he had passed the great Street and arrived to the Head of this Lane often beheld her at this Window to which she would come very obligingly when she saw him and by her  Looks express the Pleasure she took in seeing him One Night when  Romeo  came as he was wont to this Place  Julietta  seeing him opened the Window the Moon shone so bright that though he retired upon her looking out into an old ruinous Building which fronted the Window yet she distinguished him plainly and no Person being with her in the Chamber she ventured to call out to him  "Romeo  said she what do you do here alone at such an Hour should you be discovered I tremble for your Life are you ignorant of the cruel Enmity there is between our Families and how many Lives have been lost by it on both Sides certainly if you are taken you will be barbarously murdered why will you thus endanger your own Life and my Honour"  "The ardent Passion you have inspired me with answered he is the Cause of my coming hither I know if I am discovered by your Relations they will endeavour to kill me but I shall defend myself as well as I am able and though I may be overpowered by superior Force yet I will not dye alone to dye near you will take off the Bitterness of Death yet be assured Madam I never will be the Occasion of bringing any Stain upon your Honour but will with Pleasure sacrifice my Life to preserve it inviolate"  "But what is it you require of me interrupted  Julietta"  "That you would permit me to enter your Chamber Madam replied  Romeo  that I may with less Danger make known to you the  Greatness of my Passion and the cruel Torments I suffer for your Sake"  Julietta  a little offended at this Demand replied in some Confusion  "Romeo  you know the Extent of your own Passion and I know that of mine I know that I love you as much as it is possible for a Person to love and perhaps more than is consistent with my Honour however I must tell you that if you hope to possess me by any other Means than Matrimony you are much deceived and because I am sensible you expose yourself to great Danger by coming hither so frequently I am willing to bring this Affair to a speedy Conclusion therefore if you desire to be mine as I wish to be eternally yours you will make me your Wife and for that Purpose I will be ready to meet you at any convenient Place whatever Time you shall appoint me but if you have any dishonourable Intentions towards me go away I conjure you and suffer me to live in Peace"  Romeo  who only wished to possess her with Honour heard this Proposition with Transport and told her "that he would marry her at any Time and in any Manner she pleased"  "'Tis well replied  Julietta  let our Nuptials then be celebrated by the Reverend Friar  Lorenzo  of  Reggio  who is my spiritual Father" To this  Romeo  readily agreed the good Friar being very intimate in his Family and it was resolved between them that Romeo should speak to him the next Day upon that Affair  Friar  Lorenzo  in whom the Lovers chose to confide upon this Occasion was of the Order of the Minors a learned Theologician and Philosopher had great Knowledge of Herbs and was well skilled in the Magic Art and that he might maintain himself in the good Opinion of the Vulgar and quietly enjoy those Pleasures for which he had a Taste he endeavoured to procure the Friendship of all Persons of distinguished Rank and Reputation In this he succeeded so well that he had many Friends among the Nobility of  Verona  particularly the Father of  Romeo  a Nobleman in great Credit and Esteem who had a high Opinion of his Sanctity and Wisdom  Romeo  also held him in great Esteem and the Friar who knew him to be a prudent and generous Youth had a tender Affection For him The Reverend Father who confessed almost all the Persons of Quality of both Sexes in the City was also very intimate in the Family of the  Capelletti  and was therefore intrusted with the spiritual Direction of  Julietta  Romeo  the next Day after his Conference with his Mistress went to the Church of St  Francis  and related to Friar  Lorenzo  the whole Story of his Passion for  Julietta  and the happy Conclusion to which he had brought it entreating at the same time his Assistance to unite them for ever  The Friar hearing this Account promised to do all he required as well because he was not able to deny  Romeo  any thing as he hoped this Marriage would reconcile the two  Houses of the  Montecchi  and  Capelletti  and by that Means acquire to himself the Favour of Signor  Bartholomew  who passionately wished to compose the Disorders their Enmity created in his City  The two Lovers now only waiting for some Occasion of going to Confession in order to effect their Design  Julietta  for the greater Conveniency resolved to trust her Nurse who slept with her with her Love for  Romeo  his extreme Affection for her and their intended Marriage  The good Woman greatly concerned at such a precipitate Design endeavoured to disswade her from it but to no Purpose and moved with the affecting Arguments of  Julietta  was at last prevailed upon to carry a Letter to  Romeo  The Lover was transported with Joy at the Contents which directed him to come at five o'Clock that Night to the Window in the Lane bringing with him a Ladder of Ropes by which he might ascend to the Top  Romeo  committing the Care of providing the Ladder to a faithful Servant of his named  Pietro  they both at the appointed Hour went to the Place where  Julietta  expected them  As soon as she saw  Romeo  she let down a Cord from the Window which they fastento one End of the Ladder she drew it up and with the Assistance of her Nurse fixed it securely at the Top while  Romeo  and his Servant took Care to fasten it well below  Romeo  then boldly ascending the Ladder  Pietro  retired into the old ruinous House till his Master had Occasion for him The iron Bars before the Window were set so close that it was with Difficulty the passionate  Romeo  could pass his Hand through to clasp that of his adored  Julietta  "Oh  Romeo  cried the transported Maid dearer to me than the Light of my Eyes I desired to see you here that I might inform you I have ordered Matters so as that I can go to Confession with my Mother on  Friday  next we shall come to the Church about the Time that the Sermon begins take Care to acquaint Father  Lorenzo  that he may have every Thing in readiness"  Romeo  assuring her that the Friar was disposed to do whatever they desired they began to enter into a tender Conversation which the Necessity of parting for Fear of a Discovery interrupting the Lover descending the Ladder took Leave of his dear  Julietta  who though excessively pleased with the past Interview thought every Moment an Age till she could call  Romeo  her own and  Romeo  who was almost transported out of himself spent the Time in discoursing with his Confidant on his approaching Happiness  The destined Day being arrived Lady  Giovanni  the Mother of  Julietta  taking with her her Daughter and some of her Women went to the Church of St  Francis  which was then in the Citadel the old Lady as soon as she entered calling for Friar  Lorenzo  told him she had come early with  Julietta  to Confession because she knew he would be much hurried that  Day having so many spiritual Children to confess  The Friar who had been instructed before by  Romeo  and had him then concealed in his Confessionary giving the Ladies the Benediction went into the Convent and entering the Confessionary where  Romeo  was made  Julietta  who first presented herself go into the other Cell which was slightly partitioned off from that which he and  Romeo  were in having also a Grate between as soon as she was entered he gave the Sign that  Romeo  was within and removing the Grate after the first Salutation said to her"Daughter  Romeo  has informed me that you are willing to take him for a Husband and he also is desirous of having you for a Wife do you both continue to be thus disposed"  The Lovers making Answer that the wished for nothing else the Friar after a short Discourse in Praise of holy Matrimony pronounced the accustomed Form of Words ordained by the Church and gave them the nuptial Benediction  Romeo  then presenting his beloved  Julietta  with a Ring which she received with unspeakable Pleasure he consulted with her on the Means he should use to gain Access to her at Night and tenderly saluting her went cautiously out of the Church  The Friar replacing the Grate heard the Confession of the happy  Julietta  and dismissing her heard also those of her Mother and the Women who attended them and they returned again to their House  Night being come  Romeo  with his Servant went to the Garden belonging to the Lord  Capellet  's House and ascending the Wall by the Help of his faithful  Pietro  he got easily over to the other Side where he found his Bride who together with her Nurse was expecting him  Romeo  as soon as he saw her ran to her with open Arms and  Julietta  eagerly flying to him threw herself on his Neck and embraced him with inexpressible Transport they passed the whole Night in the Garden without Fear of being discovered and when the Morning approached  Romeo  after consulting with his fair Spouse on the Methods they should use to reconcile their Parents took Leave of her with a tender Embrace and returned to his House looking upon himself to be the happiest of all Men in the Possession of so beautiful a Creature and  Julietta  who thought the whole World could not produce so lovely and accomplished a Youth as her  Romeo  had no other Allay to her Happiness but the ardent Desire she felt to have their two Families reconciled that her Marriage might no longer be concealed  While the new married Couple were obliged to content themselves with short and stolen Interviews Friar  Lorenzo  was secretly practising Means to reconcile their two Houses and had put Matters in such a Train that he had some Hopes of accomplishing it  When the Feast of  Easter  was celebrated it happened that great Numbers of Coaches were assembled at the Gate of the  Borsori  near  the Castle  Vecchio  or  Old Castle  and many of the  Capelletti  and  Montecchi  meeting in that Place assaulted each other furiously with their Arms Among the  Capelletti  was a noble Youth named  Tibbald  a first Cousin of  Julietta  's who being possessed of great personal Courage animated his People against the  Montecchi  and urging them to have no Consideration for any Person whatever among their Enemies the Fray grew very bloody both Parties being continually encreased by other of their Partizans who joined them  Romeo  who was going through the City on some Diversion with several of his Companions and a few Attendants happened to pass by while the Combatants were engaged this Sight gave him great Affliction as he had Hopes from the Friar's Endeavours that Peace would have been made between their Families being desirous therefore of putting an End to the Fight he turned to his Companions and Servants and speaking so loud that he was heard by many in the Street "Brothers said he let us thrust ourselves between them and try if by any Means we can oblige them to lay down their Arms" With these Words he pressed in among the Combatants followed by his Friends and Servants labouring both with Words and Actions to prevail upon them to cease their Contention but his Entreaties and Endeavours were all ineffectual their Fury had risen to such Excess that they minded nothing but how to be revenged on each other many of each Party lying dead upon the Ground  While  Romeo  was thus generously employed in endeavouring to calm their Rage the furious  Tibbald  drew near him and gave him a thrust with his Sword in the Side which by Reason of a network of Steel he wore beneath his Cloaths did him no Harm  Romeo  notwithstanding this Outrage turning towards him said with a friendly Accent  "Tibbald  if you believe I came hither with any Intention to fight with you or any of your Party you are much deceived I passed this Way by Chance and have no other Design in mixing among you but to make those who belong to me retire"  Tibbald  either not understanding these Words or seeming not to understand them cried out "Ah Traitor thou shalt die and furiously throwing himself upon  Romeo  struck him with great Violence on the Head but the Force of the Blow though weakened by the steel Headpiece he wore yet so enraged  Romeo  that wrapping his Cloak about his Arm by Way of Shield he turned the point of his Sword towards his Enemy which piercing his Throat went quite through his Neck and came out behind so that the unhappy  Tibbald  fell dead immediately on the Earth  The Guards approaching at the Report of this Battle the Combatants dispersed different Ways and  Romeo  full of Grief for having killed  Tibbald  fled to the Church of St  Francis  followed by a great many of his Friends and Servants  Father  Lorenzo  was much affected at the News of  Tibbald  's Death which put it out of  his Power to accomplish the Peace he meditated between them however he received  Romeo  with great Kindness and concealed him in his Chamber at the Convent  The  Capelletti  assembling together went to complain to Signor  Bartholomew  of the Injury they had suffered from  Romeo  and the Father of  Romeo  together with all the Persons of Quality among the  Montecchi  went also to prove that  Romeo  had not engaged in the Fight but sought only to part the Combatants and being basely wounded by  Tibbald  killed him in his own Defence  Although it was made very clear that the  Capelletti  assaulted the  Montecchi  first and also proved by many Witnesses that  Romeo  endeavoured to part them and was wounded by  Tibbald  while he was thus employed yet Signor  Bartholomew  banished him from  Verona  and ordered the rest to forbear such Hostilities for the future  The Death of  Tibbald  caused great Affliction in the Family of the  Capelletti  but  Jullietta  wept not for her Cousin's Death but for the Banishment of  Romeo  having however that Excuse for her Sorrow she gave free Vent to her Tears and losing all the Hopes she had formerly entertained of being happy with her beloved  Romeo  she wholly abandoned herself to Grief  Understanding that he was concealed in Father  Lorenzo  's Convent she wrote a Letter to him filled with moving Complaints of their miserable Fortune intreating him with the most tender Instances of Affection that he  would allow her to accompany him in his Banishment  Romeo  received this Letter by the Hands of the old Woman who was the Confidant of their Marriage and in his Answer he conjured his dear  Julietta  not to afflict herself that in a proper Time he would do all she desired but at present he had not fixed upon the Place of his Exile though he was resolved it should be as near her as possible and concluded with earnestly desiring her to give him an Opportunity of seeing her before he went away  Julietta  naming the Garden for the Place of this last sad Interview  Romeo  at the appointed Hour came secretly out of the Convent by the Assistance of Father  Lorenzo  and attended by his faithful  Pietro  came to the Place where he was expected  Julietta  received him with a Flood of Tears and Grief so totally possessed their Souls that they continued a long Time unable to speak to each other recovering a little from this silent Excess of Sorrow they flew into each others Arms mingling Tears with their Embraces and bitter Complaints against the Cruelty of their Fortune  Great Part of the Night being wasted in this Manner  Julietta  with the most earnest and affecting Intreaties urged her beloved  Romeo  to permit her to go with him into Banishment  "Do not my Lord cried she do not leave me behind you I will cut off this long Hair and dressed in the Habit of a Boy follow you wherever you go my tender Cares shall soften the Rigour of your Exile can you have  a more faithful Servant than me Oh my dearest Husband grant me this Favour I conjure you let me share your Fate whatever it be I cannot be unhappy if I am with you"  Romeo  with the tenderest Language that Love could dictate endeavoured to comfort his afflicted Wife he assured her that his Sentence of Banishment would be shortly revoked the Prince had given his Father some Reason to expect it "But happen what will said he my lovely  Julietta  not in the Habit of a Page can I consent to see you no when you do come it must be in a Manner suitable to the Dignity of your Birth and the Quality of your Husband Depend upon it continued he my Banishment will not continue more than a Year in that Time our Parents may be reconciled the Prince himself will labour to make Peace between them but if these Hopes fail me I will then take another Course for it is impossible I should be able to live long without you"  Julietta  yielding to the Force of these Reasons and Persuasions they began to settle the Method of corresponding by Letters and the Morn now breaking amidst thousand Sighs Tears and tender Embraces they took Leave of each other  Romeo  returned to the Convent and  Julietta  to her Chamber  In two or three Days every Thing being prepared for his Departure  Romeo  left the Convent and disguised like a foreign Merchant went privately out of  Verona  Several of his most faithful Friends conducted him safely to  Mantua  where he hired a magnificent  House and having large Appointments from his Father lived with a Splendor befitting his Quality  Julietta  in the mean Time gave herself wholly up to Sorrow she loathed her Food Sleep fled from her Eyes she passed the Days in Sighs and Tears and the Nights in Complaints and Lamentations Her Mother observing her continual Grief reproved her for it many Times telling her she had wept enough for the Death of her Cousin and that it was Time to put an End to her Affliction upon his Account  Julietta  replied that she knew no Cause for Affliction nevertheless she continued to fly from all Company and Diversion and gave herself up entirely a Prey to Sadness and Tears her fixed Melancholy making so great an Alteration in her lovely Face that she no longer had any Resemblance of the once gay and beautiful  Julietta  Romeo  never failed to make Use of every Opportunity to write to her always comforting her in his Letters with Hopes of being soon together and tenderly intreating her to moderate her Affliction and become easy and chearful as she was wont to be but all was in vain the Absence of  Romeo  was the Cause of her Unhappiness and till that was removed she was incapable of receiving any Comfort  Her Mother at last supposing the Sadness of her Daughter proceeded from her Discontent at seeing so many of her young Companions married while she had no Husband proposed to her acquainted her Spouse the Lord  Capellet  with her Suspicions"Our Daughter  said she does nothing but sigh and weep I have frequently asked her the Cause of this immoderate Affliction she answers me always in the same Tone that she knows of no Cause yet every one in the House perceives her continual Melancholy certainly some violent Uneasiness preys upon her Heart and if she is suffered to go on thus she will consume away insensibly like Wax before the Fire I have imagined a thousand Reasons for this her Sorrow but what seems to me to be the most probable is that having since last Carnival seen all her Companions become Wives she is afflicted because a Husband has not yet been proposed to her she will be eighteen Years of Age St  Euphemia  's Day next and in my Opinion it is now Time we should procure her a good and honourable Husband for a young Virgin is not Merchandize that will keep long in a House"  "Since it is your Opinion replied the Lord  Antonio  to his Wife that this Melancholy of our Daughter is caused by her not having a Husband proposed to her I will endeavour to procure one suitable to the Dignity of our House but let it be your Care to find out whether her Affections are yet engaged that I may propose such a Match to her as may be agreeable to her Inclinations"  Giovanni  replied that she would do all in her Power to satisfy him in this Particular and accordingly she again questioned all  Julietta  's Attendants and every other Person in the House who she thought was likely to give her any Information but could discover nothing  Some Time after this a Match was proposed to Lord  Antonio  between the young  Paris  Count of  Lodrona  and his Daughter  Lord  Antonio  was extremely well pleased with the Proposal the Count being young handsome and very rich and desired his Lady to acquaint her Daughter with the advantageous Offer that was made her  Lady  Giovanni  did as she was directed but  Julietta  received this News with such apparent Grief that her Mother after long endeavouring in vain to find out the Cause said at last "By what I can understand then my Daughter you are not willing to be married"  "It is true Madam replied  Julietta  I never intend to marry any one and if you love me and have any Regard for my Peace you will not think of giving me a Husband"  "Will you be a Nun then replied the Mother in great Amazement tell me what are your Intentions""I will not be a Nun said  Julietta  I know not what I would be but I long to be in my Grave"  Lady  Giovanni  equally surprized and offended at this Answer was at a Loss what to say or doShe again enquired of her Daughter's Attendants if they knew the Cause of her extreme MelancholyThey replied that ever since her Cousin  Tibbald  's Death she had wholly abandoned herself to Sorrow was always in Tears and sought all Occasions of being alone  Giovanni  relating all this to her Husband He ordered  Julietta  to be called and after some little Discourse with her "Daughter  said he you are now old enough to be married I have found a Husband for you who is young handsome noble and rich it is the Count of  Lodrona  dispose yourself therefore to comply with my Will in this Affair such Matches offer but seldom"  Julietta  with more Spirit than became one of her Years replied boldly that she would not marry  Her Father greatly enraged was ready to beat her but checking his Fury a little he contented himself with threatening her with the most cruel Effects of his Displeasure if she continued disobedient and concluded with telling her that whether she was willing or not she must prepare in a few Days to go with him her Mother and other Relations to  Villa Franca  to meet the young Count who would be there with a great Retinue on Purpose to see her adding that if she made any Reply or Resistance he would break her Head and make her the most miserable Creature that ever was born  Julietta  remained like one Thunderstruck at this cruel Language and not daring to reply she retired to her Chamber and there wrote an Account of all that had passed to  Romeo  In a short Time she received an Answer from her beloved Husband who earnestly conjured her not to afflict herself but to depend upon the Promise he made her to come soon to  Verona  and take her away privately to  Mantua  While she waited the Effect of this Promise the Day approached on which she was to go to  VillaFranca  where her Father had a fine Seat Notwithstanding her great Reluctance she was obliged to go and the young Count of  Lodrona  who first saw her at Church was so struck with her Charms though now a little impaired by her continual Grief that he immediately concluded the Marriage Treaty with her Father who returned with  Julietta  to  Verona  Here he informed her that her Marriage with the Count was absolutely resolved upon exhorting her to be chearful and submit to his Will with a good Grace  Julietta  made no Answer but retired to her Chamber in order to conceal her Affliction being informed that her Nuptials with Count  Paris  were to be celebrated in a few Weeks Not knowing what to do in this terrible Extremity she at last resolved to go to Father  Lorenzo  and consult with him upon Means to avoid this detested Husband  Accordingly the next Saint's Day she went to her Mother's Chamber "My dear Mother said she at her Entrance I cannot imagine how this strange Melancholy has grown upon me but ever since the Death of my Cousin  Tibbald  I have been able to take no Pleasure in any Thing and my Dejection encreases every Day I think I will go on this blessed Saint's Day to Confession perhaps I may receive some Consolation by that Means What say you my  sweet Mother are you pleased with this Proposition Shall I go"  Lady  Giovanni  who was a very pious Woman greatly approved of her Daughter's Intention and went with her to the Church of St  Francis  where ordering Father  Lorenzo  to be called she permitted  Julietta  to go into the Confessionary and being entered "My Father said the afflicted  Julietta  no one knows better than yourself what has passed between  Romeo  and me therefore it is needless to repeat it you have no doubt read the Letter which I put into your Hand to be sent to him in which I informed him that my Father had promised me to  Paris  Count of  Lodrona Romeo  writes to me that he will shortly come and take Measures to prevent this ever happening but alas Heaven knows when he will perform his Promise the Day of my Nuptials is now fixed I see no Way to avoid the hated Count who appears to me as a Robber and Assassin You know that I am the Wife of  Romeo  and that I cannot be another's no I will be my dear  Romeo  's eternally this is my fixed Resosolution to you therefore I come for Advice and Assistance hear first however what I propose You shall my dear Father provide me a Suit of Boys Cloaths in which I will leave my Father's House very early in the Morning and thus disguised travel to  Mantua  and keep myself concealed in the House of my dear  Romeo"  The Friar who was not at all pleased with this Proposition replied"My dear Daughter  it is impossible to execute with Safety the Design you have formed the Dangers are too great you are very young your Person and Consttiution extremely delicate you could not endure the Fatigue of such a Journey you have never been accustomed to walk and not being acquainted with the Way would wander here and there without knowing whither to go Your Father would no sooner miss you than he would send People to the City Gates and into all the Streets to find you it would be impossible to escape the Search When you are brought back will not your Father by Threats and perhaps Blows force you to declare the Reason of your Flight disguised like a Boy and when he shall understand that you was going to  Romeo  will not he effectually prevent your ever seeing him more  Julietta  acquiescing in these Reasons of the good Father replied "Since you do not approve of what I have proposed which I am now convinced is not practicable give me your Advice what to do teach me how to untye this cruel Knot by which miserable that I am I find myself bound assist me if possible to get to my dear  Romeo  for without him I can no longer live but if you cannot do that help me at least to the Means of keeping myself entirely his my Husband has told me of your Knowledge of Herbs and that you can distil a Water which in two Hours time will steal away Life from the Person who takes it without giving any PainGive me such a Quantity of this  Water as will deliver me from this Count and make me able to keep my Faith with  Romeo  If he loves me as I love him he will rather see me in the Arms of Death than in those of any other Person by helping me to this quiet Death you will deliver me and my Family from great Disgrace for if I am driven to Despair and find no other Way to avoid the Miseries that wait me I will cut my Throat in the Night for I am determined to dye rather than violate my Faith to  Romeo"  Father  Lorenzo  who was one of the greatest Chemists in his Time and was well acquainted with the Virtues of Herbs and Stones among other wonderful Secrets he was possest of he had found out and composed with many somniferous Simples a certain Paste which being reduced to Powder and a small Quantity of it mixed with Water would put the Person who drank it into a Sleep so like Death that the most skilful Physician in the World might be deceived by it holding them in this sweet Trance forty Hours or more according to the Quantity of the Powder or the Constitution of the Patient He understanding therefore the fixed Determination of the unhappy  Julietta  was so moved with Compassion that it was with Difficulty he restrained his Tears  "My Daughter said he you must not think of giving yourself Death because you may depend upon it there is no returning to Life until the Day of universal Judgment when together with all the Dead you shall  be raised again be patient and resolve to live as long as God pleases he gave you Life he preserves it and in his own good Time he will resume it Banish these melancholy Thoughts from your Mind you are young and ought to be fond of Life that you may enjoy your  Romeo  do not doubt but we shall find a Remedy for the Evils you are afraid ofYou see in what great Credit and Reputation I am in this magnificen City should it be known that I was privy to your Marriage with  Romeo  what Disgrace would it not bring upon me I will my dear Daughter so manage Matters that without drawing you into any Danger you shall preserve your Faith to  Romeo  but you must be couragious and resolved and punctually observe all my Directions'  He then related to her the extraordinary Virtues of the Powder before mentioned assuring her that it had been often tried and always found perfect "My Daughter added he this precious and valuable Powder will as I have said put you into so sound and quiet a Sleep that if  Galen Hippocrates Mesue Avicenna  and all the Colleges of the most excellent Physicians that are or ever were were to see you and feel your Pulse they would with one Voice declare you dead When you have drank the Mixture you will in a few Moments fall asleep at your usual Hour of rising your Attendants will come to awake you but not be able and you being cold as Ice without Pulse or any Signs of Life your Parents Relations and all who see you  will believe you to be dead and you will be carried to the Monument of your Family there you will quietly repose the Night and Day I will take care to dispatch a Messenger to  Romeo  and he and I will come the Night following that which you are interred to the Monument and when the Dose is fully digested you will awake from this artificial Death as fresh and lovely as when you rise in a Morning from your Bed after a quiet Rest we will then take you from the Monument and you shall return with  Romeo  secretly to  Mantua  and there remain concealed till the blessed Peace I am meditating reconciles your two Houses but I must again repeat to you that Secrecy and Courage is absolutely necessary for our Design otherwise you will ruin both yourself and me"  Julietta  who would have passed through a glowing Furnace to get to  Romeo  gave absolute Credit to the Friar's Words and replied "Father I will put myself entirely into your Hands and perform whatever you require with the greatest Secrecy"  The Friar then going to the Chamber returned in a few Moments with a sufficient Quantity of the Powder which he directed her to mix in a Glass of Water  Julietta  with many Thanks received it and put it into a Purse which she carefully concealed in her Bosom  The Friar who could with Difficulty believe so young a Creature had Fortitude enough to suffer herself to be interred living in a Sepulchre with putrefied Carcasses said to her  "But my Daughter tell me sincerely do you not tremble at the Thoughts of being intombed amongst mouldering Bodies where also the Corse of your Cousin  Tibbald  newly slain is interred"  "Father replied the determined  Julietta  do not trouble yourself about my Fears if I thought I should find my  Romeo  by passing through the Midst of infernal Flames I would without trembling dare the everlasting Fires"  "In the Name of God then said the Friar go on with your Enterprize" Then taking leave of her he went back to his Chamber and  Julietta  joined her Mother who was waiting for her in the Church and as soon as they were at home "Certainly my dear Mother said  Julietta  Father  Lorenzo  is a most holy Man he has comforted me so much by his pious Discourse that the terrible Melancholy I have so long laboured under begins already to abate of its Force"  Lady  Giovanni  who already perceived an agreeable Change in the Countenance of her Daughter was extremely pleased and thanked God and the good Friar for it a thousand Times telling her Husband they ought in Gratitude for such a Service from Friar  Lorenzo  to make a present to his Monastery  Julietta  's Chearfulness persuading both her Father and Mother that there was no Cause for the Suspicion they had entertained of her being secretly in Love they began to repent they had entered into such strict Engagements with the Count of  Lodrona  because the extreme Youth of their Daughter made them willing to  keep her unmarried two or three Years longer but the Match having been concluded upon on both Sides they could not break it off without great Scandal  The Night before the Day on which the Nuptials were to be celebrated  Julietta  who thought every Moment a Year till she drank the Potion mixed it with some Water in a Phial and placed it secretly at her Bed's Head the Nurse who lay with her falling asleep soon after she was in Bed  Julietta  who could not take any Repose passed the Night in various and affecting Thoughts the Dawn approaching put her in Mind that it was Time to drink the Potion when the Image of  Tîbbald  dead as she had lately seen him with the Blood flowing from his Wound rose to her Imagination and reflecting that she would soon be inclosed in a dark Monument amidst so many dead Bodies and mouldering Bones her Blood froze in her Veins a cold Sweat hung upon all her Limbs and she began to tremble like a Leaf shaken by the Winds"Alas said she softly sighing what am I going to do Where shall I suffer myself to be carried If I should awake before the Friar and  Romeo  come to take me out of the Monument what will become of me How shall I be able to endure the Stench of the dead Body of  Tibbald  I who cannot suffer any disagreeable Smell to approach me who knows how many Serpents and horrid Worms there may be in that Sepulchre Creatures I so much fear and abhor and if I am terrified only at the Sight of them how shall I endure to have  them stinging and crawling about me how often have I heard horrid Stories related of dreadful Things which happen in the Night in Churches and Churchyards"  These and many more Thoughts of the like Nature so tormented her Imagination that she began to deliberate with herself whether she should not throw away that terrible Potion  Continuing thus irresolute a long Time her fervent Love for  Romeo  at last got the better of her Fears and the Day now shining through her Window she took the Phial from her Pillow and couragiously drank off the Liquor which in a few Moments producing its usual Effects she fell in a profound Sleep  Her Nurse who had been sensible she had slept but little in the Night thinking she was now reposing rose softly for Fear of disturbing her and went about her usual Business and when it was Time to awake her she returned to her Chamber saying as she entered "Up up you Slugabed its Time to rise" then opening the Window and perceiving  Julietta  did not yet move she approached the Bed crying "Rise rise you lazy ones" but the good old Woman was calling to the Deafthen raising her Voice she called her aloud shaking her to dissipate her Sleep but all her vital Faculties were so bound up that the loudest and most horrible Thunders would not have been able to awake her  The poor old Woman believing her now to be certainly dead burst into Tears and  Complaints and went to acquaint the unhappy Mother with the News who flying with distracted Pace to  Julietta  's Chamber and beholding her stretched breathless upon the Bed she filled the Air with dreadful Shrieks uttering such moving Expressions of Sorrow as might have softened the Rage of Tygers themselves The Tears and Groans of the Nurse and piercing Cries of the wretched Mother brought all the Family to the Chamber and among the rest the Lord  Antonio  who approaching the Bed and finding his Daughter without Sense or Motion and cold as Ice Astonishment and Grief made him for some Moments immoveable as a Statue  The sad News being spread through the City all the Relations and Friends of the Family hastened to Lord  Antonio  's House and filled it with Tears and Lamentations the most famous Physicians were immediately sent for but all their Art proved ineffectual and they declared she was absolutely dead  At this cruel Confirmation of their Fears their Weepings and Lamentations redoubled the whole City took Part in the Grief of this Family and every one bewailed the unexpected Death of the young and beautiful  Julietta  But what Words can express the deep Distress the wild Affliction of the wretched Mother deaf to all the Consolation that was offered to her she gave a Loose to Despair Now in the wild Agony of Grief she tore her Hair and shrieking pierced the Skies with her Complaints now sinking under the Load of unutterable Sorrow with Eyes streaming  with Tears and Sighs which seemed to shake her whole Frame she silently bewailed her Loss three Times she threw herself upon the Bed and clasping the cold  Julietta  to her sobbing Bosom fell breathless on the Body and was with Difficulty brought back to Life  Lord  Antonio  who had tenderly loved his Daughter was no less afflicted for her Death than his Wife but strove with manly Fortitude to conceal his Anguish in his own Breast in order to quiet her's  In the mean Time Father  Lorenzo  wrote to  Romeo  all that had passed between him and  Julietta  he desired him to come the next Night disguised to  Verona  and assist him in taking his Wife from the Tomb and carry her with him to  Mantua  This Letter he gave to a faithful Brother of the Order strictly charging him to hasten with it to  Mantua  and give it to  Romeo Montecchio  and no other Person whatever  The Friar accordingly departed for  Mantua  and arriving there in good Time alighted at the Convent of St  Francis  with an Intention to desire the Superior to let one of the Brothers accompany him into the City where he had some Business to transact  It happened that a Friar of that Convent was just then dead and because it was suspected from some Marks on his Body that he died of the Plague the Deputies of Health the same Moment that the  Veronese  Friar arrived came to the Superior with Orders from the Lord of the City that he should not suffer any one belonging to his Convent to stir  out upon any Occasion whatever for fear of spreading the Contagion  The  Veronese  Friar in vain represented to the Deputies that he was but just arrived from  Verona  and had not yet spoke with any Person in the Convent they obliged him to remain shut up with the other Friars by which Means he could not deliver the Letter to  Romeo  himself and would not according to his Orders send it by any other Person  While this passed at  Mantua  in  Verona  they were making great Preparations for the Funeral Obsequies of  Julietta  which agreeable to the Custom of the Place were to be performed the Day on which she died  Pietro  the faithful Confident of  Romeo  being then at  Verona  and hearing that  Julietta  was dead was almost out of his Wits for Grief at first he was for going directly to  Mantua  but upon Reflexion he resolved to stay till she was buried that he might be able to say to his Master he had really seen her dead  Julietta  then was carried with great Pomp to the Monument of the  Capelletti  amidst the Sighs and Tears of all the Inhabitants of  Verona Pietro  at this Sight was so lost in Affliction reflecting how ardently she was beloved by his Master that he never thought of going to Father  Lorenzo  to consult with him as he was accustomed but having seen  Julietta  entombed he mounted his Horse and rode hard till he got to  VillaFranca  where he stopt to refresh himself and after a short Sleep rising two Hours before Day he remounted his Horse and reached  Mantua  at Sunrise  Romeo  was still in Bed when he entered his Chamber and poor  Pietro  was so much affected with the sad News he brought that for some Moments he was unable to utter a Word but his Sighs and the Tears which ran down in great Abundance from his Eyes persuaded his Master that some ill Accident had happened though he was far from guessing at the real one yet with some Impatience he asked him "If his Father and all his Friends at  Verona  were well" "Speak" added he beginning to be more alarmed finding he still continued silent and weeping "Keep me no longer in Suspence but tell me what is the Cause of that Affliction I see you in"  Pietro  with a faultering Voice then told him that  Julietta  was dead that he had seen her laid in the Monument of the  Capelletti  and that it was reported in  Verona  that Grief was the Cause of her Death  Romeo  struck as with a Thunderbolt at this dreadful News remained for some Time in a speechless Agony of Grief then furiously springing out of his Bed "Ah Traitor cried he aloud cruel perfidious and ingrateful  Romeo  it was not Sorrow that killed thy Wife Grief is not so quick a Murderer Ah no it was thy Cruelty that killed her Did she not tell thee in her Letters she would dye rather than be the Wife of any other and earnestly entreat thee to come and take her from her Father's House and thou unworthy lingering Lover amused her with vain Promises but had not Resolution enough to perform them and dost thou now  stand idly weeping and  Julietta  deadOh my  Julietta  cried he raising his Voice art thou dead and do I liveAh Wretch how often have I told her that I could not live without her and yet I live I breathe and she is deadWhere is she added he gazing wildly round the Room is she not here here hovering about me expecting me to follow herHark she calls me behold she says behold me here deceitful Lover and unfaithful Husband Oh pardon me my dearest Wife I own my Guilt and since Grief is not powerful enough to deprive me of Life my own Hand shall perform that Office and do what Grief is not able to do"This said he suddenly snatched his Sword from the Head of his Bed and turned the Point of it to his Bosom but  Pietro  springing hastily to him pushed the Sword out of his Hand endeavouring by all the soft Persuasions he was Master of to prevail upon him to change his dreadful Purpose  Romeo  overwhelmed with unutterable Anguish stood silent and motionless all the Time he was speaking resembling more a Marble Statue than a living Man at last the stubborn Sorrow found a vent and his Eyes at once unlocking all their Springs poured out a River of Tears  Though the Frenzy of his Sorrow was by this Means somewhat allayed yet Despair had taken such Possession of his Soul that he was fixed in his Resolution not to live but carefully concealing his Design lest he should be prevented from executing it he charged  Pietro  with a dissembled Calmness in his Looks and Voice not to mention the Death of his Wife and the fatal Error he had like to have been guilty of to any Person whatever but to mount a fresh Horse and set out immediately for  Verona  whither he would follow him"Let not my Father know continued he that I am coming but provide me some Instruments for opening the Sepulchre where my  Julietta  is interred and wait for me at the OutHouse behind our Garden I will meet you there and we will go together to the Monument of the  Capelleti  for I must once more have a Sight of my dearest Wife pale and cold as she now lies in Death then early in the Morning I will return to  Mantua  and you may follow a little Time after"  Pietro  not suspecting his Intention departed immediately to perform his Commission and  Romeo  as soon as he was gone wrote a Letter to his Father in which he entreated his Pardon for having married without asking his Consent and related at large his Love for  Julietta  their Marriage and the fatal Consequences he conjured him also since  Julietta  had been his Daughter to have perpetual Masses said for her Soul and in order to reward the Fidelity of his Servant  Pietro  he desired that a handsome Provision might be made for him out of the Estate which had been bequeathed him by an Aunt lately deceased and since he had yet received no Part of it he ordered the first Rents to be given to the Poor having declared this to be his last Will he earnestly entreated his Father to fulfil it in every particular then closing the Letter he sealed it and put  it in his Bosom This done he gave Orders to have a Horse made ready and telling his Servants he would return the next Day he put on the Habit of a  German  Soldier and taking with him a Phial full of Mortal Poison he mounted his Horse and took the Road to  Verona  Having rode pretty fast he arrived there in the Evening and went to the House where he had appointed to meet  Pietro  who having provided every Thing that he had been commanded they went together at four o'Clock in the Morning to the Churchyard which was in the Citadel and got to the Monument of the  Capelletti  without being discovered  The Vault being opened without much Difficulty with the Instruments they had brought with them they propt up the Top with Poles and  Romeo  taking a dark Lanthorn which  Pietro  had also provided he descended into the Vault Here he beheld his Wife dead as she appeared and stretched out upon her Bier  Romeo  at this Sight fell fainting upon her Breast and continued for some Moments in a Death more real than hers recovering at last to a painful Sense of agonizing Woe he took his Wife in his Arms and holding her close prest to his Bosom bathed her cold Face with his Tears which flowed in such Abundance that for a long Time he was not able to utter a Word but when he recovered the Use of Speech he broke into such moving Complaints as might have softened the fiercest and most impenetrable Souls to Compassion Continuing still fixed in his Resolution to dye he took the Phial out of his Pocket and drank off the fatal Draught in a Moment then ascending  a few Steps he called to  Pietro  who was standing in a Corner of the Churchyard  "Pietro  said he when he approached behold here my Wife how much I did and do love her thou partly knowest thou knowest also that it is as much impossible for me to live without her as it is for a Body to live without a Soul I therefore brought with me a Poison which in less than half an Hour procures a certain Death this I have gladly drank this Moment that dying near her whom in Life I so passionately adored I may remain with her dead since my cruel Destiny would not permit us to live together See there is the Phial which I have emptied it was given me thou may'st remember by a Mountebank in  Mantua  who came from  Spoletta  and brought with him living Aspicks and other Serpents the Water it contained was distilled from those Creatures and other Serpents God of his infinite Mercy pardon me this Act since I did not destroy myself to offend him but because it was not possible for me to live without my dearest WifeThink not  Pietro  added he wiping away the Tears that flowed from his Eyes while he was speaking think not because thou seest me weep that I lament my Death at these early Years No my weeping proceeds from the Anguish I feel for the untimely Death of her who was worthy of a much longer and much more happy Life Here said he pulling out the Letter give this to my Father it contains some particular Requests which I have desired him to perform after my Death as well concerning  my Interment in this Monument as my Servants in  Mantua  and you in particular I am persuaded my Father will faithfully execute all I have required in this LetterFarewelI can no moreI feel already the Approach of DeathThe powerful Poison wanders through all my Limbs and will shortly enter the last Retreat of LifeI shall expire in half an HourTake away the Props from the Vault and leave me to breathe my Last in the Bosom of my adored Wife"  Pietro  at these Words of his Master seemed to feel his Heart tore from his Breast such was the Excess of his Sorrow Fain he would have done something to assist him but it was now in vain there was no Remedy for that fatal Poison  Romeo  descending again took  Julietta  in his Arms and after calling  Pietro  to close up the Vault fixed his dying Lips on the Mouth of his Wife and holding her fast folded to his Breast waited for Death in that Posture  Julietta  who had now digested the sleeping Powder began to awake and her Senses perfectly returning feeling herself fast embraced she suspected the Friar was going to carry her to his Cell with some impure Design Possest with this Thought "Ah Father  Lorenzo  said she is this the Fidelity you owe to  Romeo  Do you thus abuse the Trust he reposed in you" Endeavouring then to free herself from those suspected Embraces and opening her Eyes at the same Time she saw and knew  her  Romeo  though disguised in the Habit of a  German  Soldier  "And are you here my Love said she Where is Father  Lorenzo  Why don't you take me out of this Monument Haste let us go I beseech you"  Romeo  when he saw her open her Eyes and heard her speak was sensible immediately that she was really alive and feeling in the same Moment an Excess of Joy and Sorrow he strained her eagerly to his Bosom and weeping cried "Oh Life of my Life and by far the dearest Part of me what Man ever felt the extatic Joy I feel this Instant which brings me the full Confirmation that thou art not dead but alive and well in my Arms But Oh was ever Anguish equal to mine at the same Time since this happy this miserable Moment I feel myself going to be tore from thee by Death now when Life would be most welcome to me a quarter of an Hour is all the Time I can possibly live Was there ever Oh cruel Heaven an Object at one and the same Moment so exquisitely happy and so transcendantly miserable How can I do otherwise than rejoice my sweetest my most lovely Wife when I behold you living whose sudden and unexpected Death I have so bitterly wept but Oh my Sorrow is also extreme that now when Life would be dear to me since in possessing you I have all for which I wish to live now to be torn from you How severe how beyond Measure cruel is my Destiny"  Julietta  hearing  Romeo  speak in this Manner being now quite awakened replied "What Words are these you speak to me my dearest Lord is this all the Comfort you intend to give me and did you come from  Mantua  to bring me this fatal News  Romeo  then in a few Words telling her what he had done and the Cause of it "Alas alas cried the miserable  Julietta  what do I hearOh what is it you tell me By what I understand then Father  Lorenzo  did not write you an Account of the Measures he and I had taken though he promised me faithfully to do so"  Here  Julietta  weeping sighing and bitterly complaining amidst interrupting bursts of Sorrow recounted all that the Friar and she had done to avoid being married to the young Nobleman her Father had provided for her  Romeo  hearing this felt his Grief and Agony redoubled and while  Julietta  with Heartpiercing Groans lamented their unhappy Fate calling the Heavens the Stars and all the Elements most cruel and unmerciful her dying Husband observing the Corpse of  Tibbald  lying near him turned towards it  "Oh  Tibbald  said he if in thy present State thou art capable of knowing any Thing thou must know that I sought not to offend thee but that my Intention by mixing in the Combat was to persuade thy Party to retire and mine to lay down their Arms but thou possessed by long hereditary Hatred against me assaulted me cruelly with most untameable Malice then losing all Patience I scorned to  move one Step to avoid thee and thy ill Destiny made me kill thee Now then I ask thee Pardon for that Offence so much the greater as thou wert then become my Kinsman by my Marriage with thy Cousin If thou desirest Vengeance on me behold the fatal Consequences of thy Death could'st thou wish for a more compleat Revenge than that thy Murderer should here in thy Presence come to give himself a voluntary Death and dying seek a Corner of thy Sepulchre to remain interred beside thee so that though in Life we were Enemies yet in Death one Grave may hold us peaceably together"  Pietro  at this piteous Discourse of the dying Husband and the piercing Cries and bitter Complaints of the wretched Wife stood motionless with Horror and Grief almost doubting if the melancholy Scene he beheld was real and not knowing what to say or do remained fixed like a Statue on the Side of the Monument  "Oh  Romeo  said the exquisitely distressed  Julietta  since it is not the Will of God that we should live together I may at least be permitted to remain with you here for Oh be assured I will never never forsake you"  Romeo  then taking her in his Arms began with the gentlest and most tender Soothings to calm her Sorrow and persuade her to live telling her he could not die in Peace unless he was assured she would preserve her Life but while he was speaking he felt his Strength forsake him by Degrees his Eyes grew dim and all the Powers of his Body so weakened that  he was no longer able to stand but letting himself gently sink on the Ground and looking piteously in the Face of his afflicted Wife "Alas said he my LoveI am dying"  Friar  Lorenzo  who for what Reason is unknown was not willing to take  Julietta  out of the Monument and carry her to his Chamber the Night she was interred the following Night finding  Romeo  did not appear accompanied by a faithful Brother of the Order he came to the Monument with Instruments to break open the Vault and arrived there the same Moment that  Romeo  sunk down upon the Earth and seeing it already opened and  Pietro  standing by it he asked him where  Romeo  was  Julietta  hearing the Voice and knowing is to be the Friar's raising her Head and weeping said "Heaven pardon you how well you sent the Letter to  Romeo"  "I sent it replied he by Friar  Anselmo  with whom you are acquainted wherefore then do you speak to me in this Manner"  "Descend replied  Julietta  redoubling her Tears and see"  The Friar going down immediately perceived  Romeo  stretched out having yet some small Remainder of Life "Oh my Son Oh  Romeo  cried he what does this mean"  Romeo  opening his languishing Eyes and knowing the Friar with Tears which ran fast down his dying Cheeks recommended  Julietta  to his Care and devoutly asked Pardon of God and him for the Offence he had been guilty of in hastening his own Death  It was with great Difficulty the unhappy Lover pronounced these last Words which as soon as he had finished he expired  Julietta  shrieking aloud and calling many Times on the Name of her loved Husband oppressed at last with agonizing Grief fell fainting on his Body and continued so long in that State of Insensibility that the two Friars and  Pietro  who were busied in giving her all the Assistance they were able thought she was dead Recovering however to a painful Sense of Woe she wildly wrung her Hands tore off her Hair and bathed the lifeless Body with her Tears then clasping him to her throbbing Bosom "Oh thou loved Center of all my Wishes said she my dear my only Lord once the sole Bliss of my Life now ah now my only MiseryHow art thou cut off in the Spring of Youth and early Bloom of BeautyThou at a Time when all are fondest of Life hast willingly shortened thy Course and me me the unhappy CauseYes my dearest Lord thou didst come to finish thy Days in the Arms of her who in Life thou hadst loved most and who loved thee above all earthly ThingsHither thou didst come to breathe thy last Sighs and to be interred near me not suspecting these bitter Tears would have bewailed thee deadWhere art thou now my LoveArt thou not still with meI know thou artThou can'st not stay in a Place where I am notThy dear Spirit still wanders about meI seeI hear theeThou wonderest at my long StayFear not my dearest Lord but I will follow thee The  most painful Death that could be inflicted on me would not equal the Torments of living without theeI come then I come my only LoveStay one Moment for me that my freed Soul may mount with thine and be with thee for ever"  The two Friars and  Pietro  wholly subdued by Grief wept excessively at this dismal Scene yet they used their utmost Endeavours to comfort her but all in vain  "My Daughter said Father  Lorenzo  what is done cannot now be undone If Tears could recal thy  Romeo  to Life ours should flow as fast as thine but there is no Remedy for what is past comfort thyself then and resolve to live and if thou art not willing to return to thy Father's House I will place thee in a holy Monastery where thou may'st spend the Remainder of thy Life in serving God and praying for the Soul of  Romeo"  Julietta  whose Thoughts were wholly swallowed up in the blackest Despair heard with gloomy Silence all the Friar had been saying and obstinately bent on Death collecting her whole Force of Grief and violently restraining all the Powers of Life she expired holding her  Romeo  fast locked in her Arms  While the two Friars and  Pietro  were endeavouring to recover her some Soldiers passing that way by Chance alarmed by the Light they saw in the Monument ran hastily thither being informed of what had happened to the unfortunate Lovers they left the Friars under a good Guard and took  Pietro  along with them to the Prince to whom he minutely related their whole History  The Morn being now come the whole City was filled with Grief and Consternation at this melancholy Adventure the People ran in Crouds to the Monument of the  Capelletti  and the Prince being resolved that one Grave should hold the faithful Lovers their Funeral Obsequies were performed with great Pomp by the two distressed Families of the  Montecchi  and  Capelletti  between whom there was afterwards a transient Peace The Friar and  Pietro  were pardoned and the Father of  Romeo  in every Particular fulfilled the dying Requests of his beloved Son  OBSERVATIONS  on the Use  Shakespear  has made of the foregoing Novel in his Tragedy of  Romeo  and  Juliet  ON the Incidents in the foregoing Novel  Shakespear  has formed the Fable of his  Romeo  and  Juliet  one of the most regular of all his Tragedies How closely he has followed the Story may be partly seen by this Translation which is literal from the Original  Italian  of  Bandello  yet I think it will not be difficult to prove or at least to make it appear highly probable that he never saw and did not understand the Original but copied from a  French  Translation extant in his Time or what is equally probable from an  English  Translation of that  French  one both very bad in some Places rather paraphrased than translated in others the Author's Sense absolutety mistaken many Circumstances injudiciously added and many more altered for the worse or wholly omitted The Story of  Romeo  and  Juliet  may be found translated in a Book entituled  Histoires Tragiques extraictes des Oeuvres de Bandel  printed in  Paris  in the Year seven Years after  Shakespear  was born A literal Translation of  this Story from the  French  is in the second Tome of the  Palace of Pleasure  printed at  London  in the Year which is a Collection of Novels translated into  English  by  William Painter  from several  Greek Latin Spanish  and  Italian  Authors as the Title Page says but some of them are taken from Translations of those Authors into  French  of which  Romeo  and  Juliet  is one  Had  Shakespear  ever seen the original Novel in  Bandello  he would have been sensible that the Translation of it is extremely bad That he did not see it must be owing to nothing else than his not understanding  Italian  for can it be supposed that having resolved to write a Tragedy upon the Subject of an  Italian  Story he would rather chuse to copy from a bad Translation of that Story than follow the Original  This Supposition would be as absurd as to imagine a Man would slake his Thirst with the muddy Waters of a polluted Stream when the clear Spring from whence it issues is within his Reach That  Shakespear  consulted the Translator appears from his having followed him in all the Alterations he has made in the Original some few of which I shall take notice of and shew that in some Places he has not only taken Circumstances from the Translator but also made Use of his Thoughts and Expressions  In  Bandello  the Lovers pass the Night after their Nuptials in the Garden the Translator makes  Romeo  ascend the Chamber of  Julietta  in which he is followed by  Shakespear  The Translation makes them both complain of the Tediousness of the Day wish the Sun to hasten his Course or that they were able to add Wings to his Speed  Bandello  is silent upon the Subject but  Shakespear  puts almost the same Words in the Mouth of  Juliet  The Translator makes  Juliet  upon hearing that her Cousin is slain by  Romeo  break into Complaints and Reproaches against her Husband and after she has for some Time given a Loose to her Resentment her returning Tenderness for  Romeo  forces her to repent of the injurious Words which in the first Emotions of her Grief and Rage she had uttered against him she condemns herself for her too hasty Censure and begs Pardon of the absent  Romeo  for her unkind Reproaches  There is not the least Foundation for all this in the Original  Bandello  every where shews  Juliet  so much engrossed by her extreme Passion for  Romeo  that all other Affections all Tyes of Consanguinity all filial Duty and Obedience is swallowed up in the Immensity of her Love and therefore when the News of  Tibbald  's Death and  Romeo  's Banishment is brought to her at the same Time she does not weep for the Death of her Cousin but for the Banishment of her Husband  Shakespear  has indeed the same Thought  Juliet  being told by her Nurse that her Parents were weeping over the dead Body of  Tibbald  replies  Wash they his Wound with Tears mine shall be spent  When their's are dry for  Romeo  's Banishment  Her superior Affection for  Romeo  is also painted by  Shakespear  in that Speech wherein she laments his Banishment and acknowledges it is a greater Misfortune to her than the Death of all her Relations would be but both these Circumstances the Translator has in common with  Bandello  He differs from him in making  Juliet  complain of her Husband's Cruelty in killing her Cousin and  Shakespear  has exactly followed that Hint  When the Father of  Juliet  is informed of his Daughter's Sorrow for having offended him in refusing Count  Paris  for her Husband  Shakespear  makes him praise the good Friar by whom he supposes all this Alteration was brought about in almost the same Words of the Translator  Now 'fore God this reverend holy Friar  Our whole City is much bound to him  This is not the first Benefit we have received from this holy Man to whom every Citizen in this Commonwealth is dearly bound"  But in  Bandello  the Mother of  Juliet  only says "That in Gratitude for the Friar's successful Admonitions they ought to make a  Present to his Monastery which was very poor"  In  Bandello  the Friar who is sent with the Letters to  Romeo  is detained at a Monastery in  Mantua  The Translator makes him be stopped at his own Convent in  Verona  which last is followed by  Shakespear  There is no Mention made in the Original of the Apothecary of whom  Romeo  buys the Poison there we are only told that he had mortal Drugs in his Possession which was given him by a  Spoletto  Mountebank in  Mantua  long before  The Translator makes him walk through the Streets in  Mantua  in order to find a Person that would sell him such a Composition and accordingly he goes into the Shop of an Apothecary whose Poverty is observable from the miserable Furniture of it and he for a Bribe of fifty Ducats furnishes him with a strong Poison  Shakespear  has not only copied this Circumstance from the Translator but also borrowed some Hints from him in his celebrated Description of the miserable Shop  These few Instances are sufficient to prove that  Shakespear  took the Incidents on which he has founded his Tragedy of  Romeo  and  Juliet  from the Translation and consequently that he did not peruse because he did not understand the original  Italian  His Management of the Tomb Scene and the Death of the two Lovers is entirely copied from the Translator who differs greatly from the Original in those Circumstances  The plain and simple Narration of that melancholy Event in  Bandello  is more natural more pathetic and fitter to excite the Passions of Pity and Terror than the Catastrophe of the Tragedy as managed by  Shakespear  who has kept close by the Translator  In  Bandello  when  Pietro  informs his Master of  Juliet  's Death Astonishment and Grief for some Moments deprive him of Speech recovering a little he breaks into Complaints and SelfReproaches then wild with Despair he flies to his Sword and endeavours to kill himself but being prevented by his Servant he sinks into an Excess of silent Sorrow and while he weeps calmly deliberates on the Means he should use to die in the Monument with  Juliet  The Translator makes  Romeo  upon receiveing the fatal News resolve immediately to poison himself and for that Purpose  Romeo  dissembles his Affliction and tells his Servant he will go and walk about the Streets of  Mantua  to divert himself but his real Design is to procure some Poison which having purchased of a poor Apothecary he goes immediately to  Verona  Shakespear  has here copied the Translator exactly and makes  Romeo  in the Midst of his Affliction for the Death of his Wife and while the horrible Design of killing himself was forming in his Mind give a ludicrous Detail of the miserable Furniture of a poor Apothecary's Shop a Description however beautiful in itself is here so ill timed and so inconsistent with the Condition and Circumstances  of the Speaker that we cannot help being shocked at the Absurdity though we admire the Beauty of the Imagination  There appears so much Contrivance and Method in  Romeo  's Design of buying Poison and going to  Verona  to drink it in the Monument of his Wife that he might expire near her that we can hardly suppose it to be the spontaneous Effect of a sudden and furious Transport of Grief In the Original therefore we see him not taking this Resolution till the first violent Sallies of his Sorrow are abated till after in a sudden Transport of Despair he had ineffectually endeavoured to fall upon his Sword but while he forms that fatally regulated Design he is dissolved in Tears and plunged in a calm and silent Excess of Sorrow  The  French  Translator makes  Romeo  when he breaks open the Monument where  Juliet  lies command his Servant to be gone and leave him alone fiercely menacing him with Death if he disobeys  Shakespoar  does more than imitate him here for in the Play  Romeo  injudiciously adds a Reason for that Command which so far from forcing Obedience ought rather to have prevented it  The Time and my Intents are savage wild  More fierce and more inexorable far  Than empty Tygers or the roaring Sea  Yet  Romeo  a few Lines above in the same Speech condescends to dissemble with his  Servant as to the Cause of his going into the Monument  Why I descend into this Bed of Death  Is partly to behold my Lady's Face  But chiefly to take thence from her dead Finger  A precious Ring a Ring which I must use  In dear Employment  To pass by the Absurdity of those Contradictions let us only compare this wild and inconsistent Behaviour of  Romeo  in the Translation and the Play with the calm sedate yet fixed Despair of  Romeo  in the Original  As soon as he has determined upon the Manner of his Death he writes an affecting Letter to his Father in which he relates the History of his Love and Marriage with  Julietta  entreats his Pardon for disposing of himself without consulting him provides handsomely for all his Servants particularly his Confident  Pietro  and earnestly entreats that he may be interred in the Monument with  Juliet  where he goes to die  This done taking the Letter and Poison with him he goes to  Verona  opens the Monument by the Help of  Pietro  and desiring him to watch in the Churchyard lest any Person should surprize him he descends into the Vault there after tenderly gazing on his Wife and giving some Moments to the Tears and Complaints which that sad Object drew from him he drinks off the Poison then ascending a few Steps and leaning on the Side  of the Monument he calls his Servant tells him what he had done gives him the Letter to his Father assures him he will be well provided for at his dying Request then taking Leave of him descends again into the Vault and clasping the Body of his Wife in his Arms calls out to  Pietro  to close the Monument upon him and leave him to expire  There is something extremely affecting in this determined yet calm and if the Expression may be permitted gentle Despair of  Romeo  in the Original His desiring to have the Monument closed upon him while he is yet alive that he may expire in the Arms of his beloved  Juliet  is also beautifully pathetic and consistent with that violent Passion he had for her when living  Romeo  in the  French  and  English  Translaslations dies before  Juliet  awakes and the Friar and  Peter  enters the Monument the same Moment that he expires then  Juliet  awaking they press her to leave the Monument but she refusing and they both being alarmed at the Approach of some Soldiers cowardly run away and  Juliet  left alone stabs herself with a Dagger  Shakespear  has copied all these Circumstances from the Translator  Romeo  dies in the Play before  Juliet  awakes the Friar fearing to be discovered by the Watch as he calls it but there is no such Establishment in any of the Cities of  Italy  presses her to leave the Monument she refuses he runs away and she stabs herself with  Romeo  's Dagger  In  Bandello  while the dying Husband is holding her lifeless Body as he supposes in his  Arms and shedding his last Tears for her Death she awakes she opens her Eyes gazes on him and entreats him to carry her out of the Monument  Romeo  is for some Moments lost in a Transport of Surprize and Joy to see her alive but reflecting that he is poisoned that he must shortly die and leave her his Agonies return with double Force How pathetically does he complain of his miserable Destiny With what tender Extasy does he congratulate her Return to Life With what affecting Sorrow lament his approaching Death which must tear him from her nor is the Astonishment the Grief and wild Despair of the wretched  Juliet  less beautifully imagined  The Speech of  Romeo  to the dead Body of  Tibbald  is very moving and expressive of the Gentleness and Candour of his Disposition His sinking from the Arms of his Wife when the Poison begins to exert all its Force his falling extended at her Feet gazing on her with a Look that seemed at once to give and ask Compassion and gasping out "Alas my Love I die" is pathetic to the last Degree  The Friar the same Moment arrives at the Monument  Juliet  hearing his Voice passionately upbraids him with not sending to  Romeo  he justifies himself descends into the Vault and beholding  Romeo  extended almost lifeless on the Earth breaks into an Exclamation of Surprize and Grief  Romeo  then opening his Eyes for the last Time recommends  Juliet  to  his Care and asking Pardon of Heaven for his Offence expires  The tender Expostulations of the Friar with  Juliet  after  Romeo  dies her gloomy Silence her fixed Despair and lastly her Death occasioned by the Violence of her stifled Grief are Circumstances truly tragical and wrought up with all the Force of a poetic Imagination  Had  Shakespear  ever seen the  Italian  Author these striking Beauties would not have escaped him and if by copying the Translation only he has given us a very affecting Tragedy what might we not have expected had he drawn his Hints from the beautiful Original  How little  Shakespear  owed to his own Invention in his Tragedy of  Romeo  and  Juliet  may be seen by comparing that Play with the foregoing Novel What Variations he has made he was led into by copying from the  French  Translation or perhaps from the  English  one in the  Palace of Pleasure  which is literal from the  French  and since it is pretty clear he did not understand the  Italian  it is probable he took many more of his Plots from that Book in which a great Number of the  Italian  Novels are translated some from  French  Translations as  Romeo  and  Juliet  and others from the original Authors  There is not one Incident of  Shakespear  's Invention in his Play of  Romeo  and  Juliet  except the Death of  Paris  by  Romeo  This Character might have been very well spared in the Drama his Appearance is of little Use and his Death of still less except to divert  our Compassion from the two principal Persons in the Play whose Deaths make up the Catastrophe of the Tragedy  Paris  seems only introduced to fall by the Hands of  Romeo  and why must our Compassion of the unfortunate  Romeo  be suspended by the undeserved Fate of  Paris  What Necessity is there for making  Romeo  who is all along represented as an amiable and virtuous Character imbrue his Hands in the Blood of an innocent Youth whose Death is of no Consequence just before he expires  This Incident however is the only one of the Poet's Invention throughout the Play The Fable and all the Characters except  Mercutio  were formed to his Hands  Mr  Pope  in his Preface to his Edition of  Shakespear  's Plays tells us that  "Shakespear  's Characters are Nature herself and that it is a Sort of Injury to call them by so distant a Name as Copies of her"  It is certain that all the Characters in  Romeo  excepting as I said before  Mercutio  's are exact Copies of those in the Novelist and since he copied them from the Translator and not the Original in this Instance Mr  Pope  's Observation of other Authors may be applied to  Shakespear  that "His Picture like a mock Rainbow is but a Reflexion of a Reflexion"  The seventh Novel of the third Decad of the Hecatomythi of  Giraldi Cinthio  _IN  Venice  there was a  Moor  who for his extraordinary Valour and the many Proofs he had given of his consummate Prudence and superior Genius for War was extremely dear to that Republic which more than any other delighted in rewarding great and virtuous Actions  A  Venetian  Lady of wonderful Beauty named  Disdemona  not subdued by the irregular Sallies of a female Appetite but struck with the great Qualities and noble Virtues of the  Moor  became violently enamoured of him and he no less charmed with the Greatness of her Mind than with the extreme Beauty of her Person burnt in the most ardent Flames for her  Fortune so far favoured their mutual Passion that notwithstanding the united Endeavours  of all the Lady's Kindred to prevent it they found Means to get their Marriage solemnized and during their Abode in  Venice  they lived together in the greatest Harmony and Tranquility imaginable  It happened that the Senate of  Venice  recalled their Forces which were at  Cyprus  and gave the Command of those which were to be sent thither in their stead to the  Moor  This Dignity was never conferred upon any but Persons of unquestionable Courage and Fidelity  The  Moor  therefore considering this Command as a Reward for that Valour he had shewn in the Service of the Republic received it with great Joy but when he reflected on the Length and Danger of the Voyage the Necessity there seemed of leaving  Disdemona  behind him filled him with inconceivable Concern  Disdemona  whose Felicity wholly centered in the  Moor  was transported to find the Senate by the public Dignity they bestowed on him had given a Sanction to her Choice and having resolved to accompany her Husband in so honourable an Expedition waited for the Time of their Departure with the utmost Impatience  The secret Grief which prey'd on the Heart of the  Moor  beginning as the Time of parting approached nearer to spread a Gloom on his Countenance and give an Air of Restraint to his Behaviour  Disdemona  extremely alarmed entreated him to tell her the Cause of that Change she observed in him  "What is the Reason said she that I see you melancholy and dejected at a Time when the Honours you have received from the Senate give you most Reason to rejoice"  "The Excess of my Love for you replied the  Moor  sighing prevents me from enjoying those Honours as I ought since they force me to the sad Necessity of suffering one or other of two Things both equally insupportable for either I must expose you to the Dangers of the Sea by taking you with me to  Cyprus  or else leave you behind me at  Venice  The first cannot but be a most heavy Misfortune to me since every Fatigue you will suffer every Danger you are exposed to will bring me the extremest Affliction and as for the second parting with you is more terrible than parting with my Life"  "Ah my dearest Husband said  Disdemona  what Thoughts are these which you have suffered to afflict you Did you imagine I would consent to a Separation from you How could you wrong my Love so much That Love which to be with you would impel me to pass even through Flames well may I then resolve to accompany you to Sea in a secure and well mann'd Ship If there are Dangers and Fatigues to be endured you shall not endure them alone I will share your Fortune whatever it be and nothing but Death shall divide me from you"  The  Moor  in a Transport of grateful Tenderness throwing his Arms round her Neck and pressing her to his Bosom cried out "Heaven long preserve you my most dear  my lovely Wife in these affectionate Sentiments for me"  Some little Time after the necessary Preparations for their Voyage being ready the  Moor  with  Disdemona  and their Attendants entered a Galley and set sail for  Cyprus  whither after a pleasant and easy Voyage they arrived together with all the Forces under the  Moor  's Command  Among the Officers in these Troops was a Lieutenant very dear to the  Moor  Nature had given him a most beautiful and graceful Person but a Mind replete with all Manner of Wickedness however he knew so well how to conceal his vicious Inclinations under an apparent generous and noble Behaviour that his Hypocrisy assisted by the Speciousness of his Form procured him the Esteem and Friendof all his Companions  The  Moor  who had conceived a particular Friendship for him took great Pleasure in his Conversation and invited him frequently to his House and  Disdemona  fond of every Occasion of gratifying the Humour of her Husband treated him with equal Civility  The Lieutenant had married a young Woman at  Venice  whom he brought with him to  Cyprus Disdemona  fond of this Woman because she was an  Italian  and also an agreeable Companion went often to her House and passed great Part of the Day with her  The villainous Lieutenant having by these Means frequent Opportunities of seeing  Disdemona  became violently enamoured of her and neither restrained by the Fidelity he owed  his Wife or the Respect and Gratitude due to his Friend and Commander resolved to use his utmost Endeavours to gratify his infamous Passion  Well knowing that Death would be the Consequence of his presumptuous Attempt if it came to the Knowledge of the  Moor  he durst not discover his Flame to  Disdemona  any other Way than by Sighs and passionate Glances hoping in Time to inspire her with Desires like his own  But the Lady whose Thoughts were wholly engrossed by the  Moor  took so little Notice of those silent Addresses that her Indifference persuading him some other Lover possessed her Heart Rage Jealousy and Despair produced the Effects of the most violent Hatred and he resolved to be revenged both on her and the Lover she favoured  A young Gentleman who was Captain of a Troop at  Cyprus  and greatly beloved by the  Moor  was suspected by the Lieutenant to be the happy Rival who enjoyed the Affections of  Disdemona  his Death therefore he determined to procure and by accusing the Lady to the  Moor  of Adultery prevent any other from possessing her since he could not  His Design thus laid he waited only for some favourable Opportunity to put it in Execution the  Moor  's passionate Affection for his Wife and the great Affection which subsisted between him and the young Captain making the Villain apprehend his Enterprize would be very hazardous and doubtful  Fortune however assisted his wicked Intentions and when he least expected it afforded him the Means of effecting them  The Captain happening indiscreetly to draw his Sword upon a Soldier and wounding him the  Moor  was so much offended that he deprived him of his Command  Desdemona  who only regarded this young Gentleman because he was beloved of her Husband was greatly concerned that he had fallen under his Displeasure and often solicited for his Pardon  "I am so pressed said the  Moor  one Day to the Lieutenant with my Wife's Entreaties in Favour of the Captain that I believe I must comply with her Desire and pardon him"  "She has Reason said the Villain seizing this Occasion to execute his Scheme that she may see him as usual"  "What is it you say" replied the  Moor  hastily  "Do not insist upon my speaking plainer resumed the Lieutenant Far be it from me to sow the Seeds of Discord between Man and Wife yet methinks if you would open your Eyes some Things would not escape your Observation"  The  Moor  rouzed to Attention by these Words and greatly disturbed at the latent Meaning of them earnestly entreated the Lieutenant to explain himself more clearly but the artful Villain absolutely refused and though the  Moor  used his utmost Endeavours to persuade him to give him the Satisfaction he desired yet he persisted in an obstinate Denial  Nevertheless the Hints he had thrown out fixed a thousand Stings in the Breast of the wretched Husband he ruminated Night and Day on the Purport of those fatal Words and the more he reflected on them the more his Disquiet encreased  Disdemona  ignorant of the Cause of his Melancholy did not neglect to solicit still for the Captain"Why said she to him one Day will you suffer a small Fault to cancel the Friendship which has subsisted so many Years between the Captain and you Must all his Services and longexperienced Fidelity be wholly forgot for the Sake of one inconsiderate Action The Soldier he wounded is no longer at Enmity with him they are reconciled and why should you continue inexorable"  The  Moor  no longer able to suppress the Emotions with which his Heart had been long agitated replied in a Rage  "It is strange  Disdemona  it is very strange that you should be so extremely concerned about this Man if he was your Brother or some other Relation his Interests could not be dearer to you"  The Lady answered in a soft and humble Accent "Heaven forbid my Lord that I should incur your Displeasure by soliciting for the Captain's Pardon to which nothing has induced me but the Concern I am under to see you deprived of so good a Friend a Friend whose Fidelity you have so often praised to me the Fault he has committed is not great enough to merit your Hatred but you  Moors  are by  Nature so furious that every little Thing moves you to Anger and a Desire of Revenge"  "And that answered the  Moor  excessively enraged at her Words ome Persons who little think of it shall prove yes they shall see me take a severe Vengeance for the Injuries I have suffered and then and not till then shall I be satisfied"  Disdemona  full of Fear and Wonder at these ungentle Words and unaccustomed Rage of her Husband trembling and pale replied "Although my only Inducement to plead for the Captain was the Consideration of your Ease and Satisfaction yet since my Solicitations are displeasing to you I will never more speak to you on this Subject"  To this humble and submissive Answer the  Moor  made no Reply but comparing his Wife's earnest Entreaties for the Captain with the Lieutenant's Insinuations a thousand black Suspicions rose in his Mind tortured with Doubts of her Fidelity and wishing yet dreading to be freed from his distracting Suspence  He quitted her with a gloomy Silence and sending for the Lieutenant renewed his Entreaties that he would speak more openly concerning his Wife and the Captain  The Villain who had resolved to effect the Ruin of these two Innocents after long resisting the  Moor  's Solicitations as if unwilling to give him Pain feigning at last to be overcome by his repeated Prayers said "I cannot deny my Lord but that my extreme Reluctance to give you Uneasiness has prevented me thus  long from telling you what must afflict you more than any other but since you command me to speak plain the Regard I have for your Honour as my Friend and the Duty I owe you as my General will not permit me to disobey you Know then that your black Colour is become distasteful to your Wife she is passionately in love with the Captain and her Impatience at finding herself deprived of the Pleasure she took in his Company is the Cause of her continual Solicitations for his Pardon that she may converse with him as usual"  These Words gave mortal Agonies to the Soul of the wretched  Moor  and though he was but too well convinced of the Truth of them yet dissembling his Conviction in order to try him further "I know not said he with a furious Countenance why thou hast dared to load my Wife with these infamous Aspersions"  "This Rage replied the Lieutenant is the Reward I expected for my friendly Information but since my Duty and the Desire of preserving your Honour has carried me this Length I will not now go back What I have told you is but too certain and if your Wife with a counterfeited Tenderness has so blinded your Eyes that you will not see your Dishonour there is no Reason why I should not declare the Truth to you The Captain himself has owned to me the Favours he has received from her not satisfied with possessing her in Secret he must have a Confident in his Happiness but had I not been  afraid of your Resentment I would that Moment have rewarded his presumptuous Confession with the Death he merited"  The  Moor  racked with unutterable Pangs cried out "Give me the Means of seeing with my own Eyes the Truth of what you have said or else be sure I will make thee wish thou hadst been dumb"  "It would have been easy to do this replied the Villain while the Captain and you continued in Friendship and he had free Access to  Disdemona  but now that you have punished him for a slight Fault instead of taking Vengeance for an irreparable Injury it will be difficult to satisfy you but though I am persuaded that he enjoys  Disdemona  whenever you give him an Opportunity yet it is certain since he is in Disgrace with you he is obliged to act more cautiously than before when through your Friendship for him he came to your House every Day however added he taking Leave of him I do not despair of being able soon to give you an Opportunity of seeing what you will not believe without it"  The unhappy  Moor  then returned to his House carrying a poisoned Arrow in his Breast and impatiently waited for the Day in which the Lieutenant was to prove the Truth of what he had told him and confirm him in eternal Misery  Nor was the Villain himself wholly at ease when reflecting on the known Chastity of  Disdemona  he was sensible he could not give  the  Moor  such a convincing Proof of her Disloyalty as he demanded  After long deliberating with himself on the Methods by which he might best execute the horrid Scheme he had begun he at last thought upon a Stratagem which seemed to promise Success  Desdemona  as has been already said went often to visit the Lieutenant's Wife the Villain when she was one Day at his House observed a Handkerchief at her Girdle finely wrought in  Moresco  Work which because it was presented her by the  Moor  when he married her she had a particular Value for it it being also highly prized by the  Moor  himself This Handkerchief the Lieutenant determined to steal and with it accomplish her absolute Ruin  Disdemona  being extremely fond of a little Child of his about three Years of Age he took her in his Arms and carried her to the Lady who receiving her from him kissed her several Times and pressed her close to her Breast  The Villain in the mean while drew her Handkerchief gently from her Girdle and concealing it in his Pocket went away transported with Joy at his good Success  Disdemona  wholly ignorant of her Loss returned to her House and did not miss her Handkerchief till some Time after when happening to have Occasion for it and not being able after diligent Search to find it she concluded it lost and remained extremely terrified  lest the  Moor  should ask for it as he often did  The Lieutenant who had all this while been watching for an Opportunity to dispose of it where it might produce the Mischief he had projected found Means at last to leave it on the Captain's Bed whom he visited one Morning before he was up for that Purpose  The Captain rising soon after he went away the Handkerchief fell upon the Floor and he finding something under his Feet stooped to take it up and seeing the Handkerchief knew it to be  Disdemona  's but was not able to imagine how it came there resolving however to return it to her he put it in his Pocket and going out was informed that the  Moor  was not at home taking this Opportunity therefore to deliver it he went to a back Door and knocked softly Fortune as it should seem conspiring with the cruel Lieutenant to ruin the innocent  Disdemona  brought the  Moor  back just in that Moment who hearing somebody knock in that cautious Manner full of tormenting Distrust he ran to a Window and opening it enquired in a surly Accent who was there  The Captain hearing the  Moor  's Voice and fearing that he intended to do him a Mischief ran away without speaking a Word  The  Moor  ran eagerly down Stairs and rushed into the Street to seek him but he was already out of Sight then returning full of Rage and Grief he went to his Wife's Apartment and asked her if she knew who it was that had knocked below  The Lady replied "that she could not tell who it was" which indeed was true  "I think said the  Moor  it seemed to be the Captain"  "I know not replied  Disdemona  whether it was him or any other"  The  Moor  supposing she did not answer him truly with Difficulty restrained his Rage from breaking into Reproaches and Menaces but resolving to act nothing against her till he had consulted his wicked Confidant and to prevent her discovering his Disorder left her suddenly and went to the Lieutenant to whom he related what had happened entreating him to go to the Captain and endeavour to make some more Discoveries  The Villain secretly exulting at this Accident promised him to do as he required and placing the  Moor  where unseen himself he might see them together though not hear their Discourse he artfully contrived to bring the Captain near the Place and began to talk with him on indifferent Things using at the same Time such Gestures with his Head and Hands as persuaded the  Moor  they were talking about  Disdemona  and making a Jest of his Dishonour and her Incontinence  When they parted the  Moor  eagerly quitted his Concealment and came to the Lieutenant to know what they had been saying  The subtle Villain suffering himself to be long entreated before he would discover what he had heard at length confessed that the Captain told him "he had often enjoyed  Disdemona  when by his being abroad they had  an Opportunity to meet and added that the Captain had told him also that the last Time he was with  Disdemona  she gave him that Handkerchief which he had presented her the Day of their Marriage"  The  Moor  thanked the Lieutenant for this Intelligence and told him "that he would ask  Disdemona  for that Handkerchief and if she could not produce it he should be convinced all that he had told him concerning her Infidelity was true"  Accordingly one Day after Dinner discoursing freely with  Disdemona  on indifferent Things he took Occasion to speak of the Handkerchief and asked to see it  The Lady who had long dreaded this Demand blushed excessively and thinking to conceal her Confusion which was well observed by the  Moor  rose and pretended to seek for it and after she had employed herself in this Manner some time "I cannot find it said she returning to her Husband perhaps you have it yourself"  "Is it probable replied he that I would desire you to give it me if I had it in my Possession however look for it no more at present you will find it perhaps some other Time"  Then leaving the Room he began to consider in what Manner he should murder his Wife and the Captain without bringing on himself the Suspicion of being the Author of their Deaths  These gloomy Thoughts employing him Night and Day  Disdemona  who perceived  his Behaviour to her much altered often endeavoured to discover the Cause  "What ails you my Lord said she to him many Times Why do I behold you always disturbed and uneasy You who used to be the gayest Man in the World are now become the most peevish and melancholy"  The  Moor  continuing to dissemble his Resentment returned her evasive Answers with which she was but ill satisfied conscious she had given him no Cause for treating her unkindly she concluded Possession had abated his Flame and Disgust had succeeded to his once violent Passion for her full of these melancholy Apprehensions she went to the Lieutenant's House in order to unburthen her Heart to his Wife with whom she lived in great Familiarity  "Alas said she weeping as soon as she saw her I know not what to think of my Lord he who was once all Love and Tenderness towards me is become so altered within these few Days that I am persuaded he no longer loves me and I fear I shall prove a sad Example to all young Ladies who presume to marry against the Consents of their Parents and a Warning to the  Italian  Women never to join themselves to Men between whom and them Nature and Heaven have placed such wide DistinctionsI know added she sighing that my Lord is fond of your Husband and communicates to him all his Affairs if through him then you are acquainted with the Cause of the  Moor  's unaccustomed Coldness  to me I entreat you to let me know it and do not refuse me your Assistance in this Distress"  The Lieutenant's Wife was indeed well acquainted with the whole Affair her Husband having often pressed her to join with him in his cruel Schemes against the innocent  Disdemona  but though she never would consent to the being accessary to her Ruin yet dreading her Husband's Resentment if she betrayed his Secret she only replied "I advise you Madam to beware of giving the General any Suspicions of your Fidelity and let it be your continual Study to persuade him of your Truth and Affection"  "All this I do replied the weeping  Disdemona  but all is in vain"  In the mean time the  Moor  restless unresolved and seeking Occasion to be convinced of what he wished not to know entreated the Lieutenant to contrive it so that he might see  Disdemona  's Handkerchief in the Captain's Hands  This although the Villain thought very difficult yet he promised to perform and watched all Opportunities of keeping his Word  The Captain had a Woman in the House who was very skilful in Works of Embroidery she having seen  Disdemona  's Handkerchief and understanding that it was to be returned to her resolved to work one like it  The Lieutenant being informed of this and one Day knowing that Woman was seated at a Window working with the fatal Handkerchief before her for a Pattern he carried the  Moor  through the Street who perceiving his Wife's Handkerchief in that Woman's Possession had no longer any Doubt of her Infidelity and took a firm Resolution to murder her and the no less injured Captain  Conferring therefore with the Lieutenant upon the Means of executing his horrid Purpose he earnestly entreated him to undertake to murder the Captain assuring him that he would never forget the Obligation  The Lieutenant excusing himself from complying as well for the Wickedness of the Deed as for the great Danger in attempting it the Captain being a very brave and couragious Man the  Moor  added to his Entreaties the Present of a large Sum of Money which at last fixed him in a Resolution to obey him  The Lieutenant had not waited long for an Opportunity of executing his impious Design before Fortune presented him with a very favourable one  The Captain coming late one Night out of the House of a Courtezan whom he kept the Lieutenant who was watching for him rushed suddenly and with one Stroke of a Scymetar cut off his Leg  The unhappy Captain fell to the Ground and the Lieutenant upon him who sought to finish the Murder wounded as he was however he drew his Sword and endeavoured to defend himself crying out aloud for Help  Some Soldiers who were quartered near the Place came running to his Assistance so that the Lieutenant fearing to be discovered left him and ran away yet he did not go far but  taking a little Compass joined some other Persons who drawn by the Captain's Cries were hastening to him and mixing among the Crowd who were about him he saw that his Leg was cut off and did not doubt but he would die of the Wound nevertheless concealing his inward Joy at his Success under an Appearance of great Concern for the Captain's Misfortune he lamented it as if it had happened to his Brother  In the Morning the News of this Accident was spread all over the City and coming to the Knowledge of  Disdemona  she who was naturally tender and compassionate expressed great Sorrow for it  The  Moor  distracted with Rage at this Confirmation as he thought it of her Affection for the Captain went hastily to his wicked Confidant"Dost thou know said he trembling with Fury that my Wife is in such Grief for the Captain's Misfortune that she is almost distracted"  "How can it be otherwise replied the Lieutenant when he is her Soul"  "Her Soul repeated the furious  Moor  Ah I will tear her Soul from her BodyI should be unworthy the Name of a Man if I suffered such a Wretch to live"  Then consulting together how they should dispatch her whether by Poison or a Dagger the Lieutenant pausing said "I have thought of a Method by which you may kill her without giving Suspicion to any one that you had any Hand in her Death and this it is The House in which you live is very old  and the Cieling of your Chamber has many Cracks in it 'tis my Advice that we should beat  Disdemona  with a Bag of Sand till she dies that no Mark of Violence may appear on her Body when she is dead we will throw down Part of a rotten Beam from the Cieling and having broke her Scull pretend she was killed by the Fall of the Beam as she lay in Bed  This cruel Contrivance pleased the  Moor  extremely and having agreed to execute it the following Night he found Means secretly to convey the Lieutenant into a Closet within the BedChamber  The unhappy  Disdemona  retired at her usual Hour to Bed and the  Moor  with her they had not lain long before the Lieutenant making some little rustling in the Closet the  Moor  asked his Wife if she heard any Noise  She answering in the affirmative rise then said the  Moor  and see what it is  The Lady got up immediately and the Lieutenant that Moment rushing out of the Closet gave her a furious Blow with a Bag of Sand on her Back the wretched  Disdemona  fell on the Floor almost breathless yet faintly calling her Husband to help her he throwing himself out of the Bed replied infamous Woman thou now receivest the Reward of thy Unchastity thus ought all Adulteresses to be treated who deluding their Husbands with a feigned Affection load them with Shame and Grief  The wretched Lady hearing these Words and feeling herself near her End by another Blow which the cruel Lieutenant had given  her sighed out with a broken and interrupted VoiceSince Justice has been denied me in this World Oh let the Divine Justice bear Witness to my Innocence and receive my Soul to Mercy  The remorseless Villain unmoved with this pathetic Exclamation striking her a third Time with all his Force she expired immediately  When they were convinced she was dead the Lieutenant took her off the Floor and crashing her Scull laid her in the Bed then with the  Moor  's Assistance broke down Part of a Beam and placed it so as to give it an Appearance of having fallen upon her Head  The Lieutenant then went cautiously out of the House and the  Moor  with loud Cries began to call for Help saying the House was tumbling down the Servants and Neighbours ran in to his Assistance and some of them approaching the Bed found  Disdemona  within it dead and as they supposed murdered by the Fall of the Beam  This piteous Spectacle drew Tears and Complaints from all who beheld it and the next Day the Corpse of the injured Lady was buried amidst the universal Grief of all the Inhabitants of  Cyprus  to whom her Virtues had rendered her extremely dear  The Manner of her Death not being suspected by any one the villainous Perpetrators of it thought themselves absolutely secure but the Almighty Justice would not long permit such a Crime to remain unpunished  The  Moor  who had loved the unhappy Lady with the utmost Excess of Passion finding himself deprived of her for ever and not able to endure the Loss his whole Soul was filled with the most torturing Anguish and in the Frenzy of his Grief he would search for her in every Apartment of the House and call incessantly on her Name then reflecting that by the Lieutenant's Accusations he had lost this beloved Wife for ever and with her all the Comfort and Happiness of his Life he conceived so violent a Hatred of him that he could not endure to have him in his Sight and had he not feared the inviolable Justice of the  Venetian  Senate he would have put him to Death but not being able to do this without hazarding his own Life that he might in some Measure gratify his Revenge he deprived him of his Post  The Lieutenant enraged as this Treatment resolved to effect his Ruin and for that Purpose went to the Captain who was now recovered but with the Loss of his Leg having been obliged to have a wooden one in its stead "The Time is now come said the diabolical Villain in which you may take Vengeance on the Man who was the Occasion of the Loss of your Leg if you will go with me to  Venice  I will there discover him to you and the Senate and prove the Truth of what I now say but here for many Reasons I dare not speak plainer"  The Captain who wished for nothing so much as to be revenged on this secret Enemy thanked the Lieutenant for his Information  and a few Days after they both embarked for  Venice  When they arrived the Lieutenant told him that it was the  Moor  who had cut off his Leg through an Opinion that he had dishonoured his Wife and that for the same Cause he had also murdered her and made it be reported that she was killed by the Fall of a Beam  The Captain hereupon accused the  Moor  to the  Venetian  Senate of having deprived him of his Leg and murdering his Lady producing the Lieutenant for a Witness to both these Facts  The Lieutenant then related the Manner in which it had been executed adding that the  Moor  had communicated this whole Scheme to him and offered him great Rewards to assist him in it which because of the Wickedness of the Deeds he had absolutely refused  The Senate enraged at the Cruelty which had been practised by a Barbarian upon two of their Citizens sent Orders to have the  Moor  arrested at  Cyprus  and brought with a strong Guard to  Venice  Soon after his Arrival he was publicly tried but persisting in a Denial of the Crimes with which he was accused he was put to the Torture but such was his extream Obstinacy and Contempt of Pain that all the different Torments which were inflicted on him were not able to force a Confession from his Lips  He was therefore sent back to Prison and some Time after banished from  Venice  for ever but though he had escaped Death by the  Law yet the Relations of  Disdemona  procured him to be murdered in the Place to which he had retired  The Lieutenant returned to his own Country and continuing still in his wicked Practices he accused one of his Companions of having offered him a Reward to kill his Enemy the Gentleman was seized and racked but he denied the Fact so resolutely and spoke so much against his wicked Accuser that he also was put to the same Torture so that being miserably mangled he died as they were taking him down from the Rack to carry him to his own House  The Lieutenant's Wife after her Husband's Death returning to  Venice  related all the foregoing Particulars to the Senate And thus by the especial Providence of God was the Death of the innocent  Disdemona  revenged  OBSERVATIONS  on the Use  Shakespear  has made of the foregoing Novel in his Tragedy of  Othello  or the  Moor  of  Venice  OTHELLO  or the  Moor  of  Venice  the Plot of which is drawn from the foregoing Novel of  Giraldi Cinthio  has always been esteemed one of the best of  Shakespear  's Tragedies  'Tis confessed the Fable is more regular the Incidents less numerous and closer connected and the Subject more of a Piece than any other of his Plays except  Romeo  and  Juliet  The Fable  Shakespear  found already formed to his Hands some few Alterations he has made in it and generally for the better  Thus it stands in the Poet  Othello  a  Moor  descended of Royal Blood eminent for his great Valour and the Services he had done the  Venetians  in their Wars is preferred by the Senate to the Government of the Island of  Cyprus  which was threatned with an Invasion by the  Turks  Othello  being commanded to go immediately to his Government takes with him at her earnest Request his Bride  Desdemona  a young Lady of great Beauty Daughter to a Senator  of  Venice  who had married him unknown to her Father  Iago  Ancient to  Othello  being jealous that the Moor had had an Intrigue with his Wife and desirous of procuring the Post of Lieutenant for himself which was possessed by  Cassio  a young Officer very dear to the Moor to gratify his Revenge and Ambition at once he entertains a Design of making  Othello  jealous of  Desdemona  and  Cassio  so to bring about her Death and the Removal of  Cassio  To effect this by various Arts he raises Suspicions in the Mind of  Othello  and to confirm them prevails on his Wife who attended  Desdemona  to steal a Handerchief which the Moor had given her  This Handkerchief he drops in  Cassio  's Apartment and  Othello  accidentally seeing it in his Hand is convinced of his Wife's Infidelity orders  Iago  to kill his Rival promising to make him his Lieutenant in his stead and himself smothers  Desdemona  in her Bed  Cassio  escapes only with a slight Wound  Emilia  the Wife of  Iago  finding her Mistress murdered and hearing  Othello  declare he had killed her through her Husband's Informations that she had wronged him with  Cassio  in whose Possession he had seen the Handkerchief he had given her she confesses she had stolen the Handkerchief at her Husband's Request  Iago  finding himself discovered stabs his Wife and in Part confesses his Villany  Othello  in Despair falls upon his Sword and dies and the Punishment of  Iago  is left to  Cassio  who before  Othello  's Death was ordered by the Senate to take upon him the Government of  Cyprus  In  Cinthio  the Moor is mentioned without any Mark of  Distinction Shakespear  makes him descended from a Race of Kings his Person is therefore made more considerable in the Play than in the Novel and the Dignity which the  Venetian  Senate bestows upon him is less to be wondered at  In the Play  Cassio  the Person of whom  Othello  is jealous is represented to be a young amiable Officer remarkable for the Agreeableness of his Person and the Sweetness of his Manners and therefore likely enough to inspire  Desdemona  with a Passion for him  In the Novel these Qualities are all ascribed to the Villain who betrays the Moor to the Murder of his Wife and the suspected Rival is no more than an ordinary Person  Cinthio  might perhaps think it necessary to give his Villain a pleasing Person and insinuating Address in order to make his Artifices less suspected but to give Probability to the Jealousy of the Moor was it not also as necessary to make the suspected Rival possess some of those Qualities with which the Minds of young Ladies are soonest captivated  Shakespear  therefore paints  Cassio  young handsome and brave and  Othello  who feeds his Jealousy by reflecting that he himself is neither young nor handsome by the same Train of Thought falls naturally into a Suspicion that what he loses for want of those  Qualities will be gained by another who possesses them  But on the other Hand  Shakespear  has made a very ill Use of the Lieutenant's Wife  Cinthio  shews this Woman privy much aagainst her Will to the Design on  Disdemona  and though she dares not discover it to her for fear of her Husband's Resentment yet she endeavours to put her upon her Guard and gives her such Advice as she thinks will render all his Schemes ineffectual  Shakespear  calls this Woman  Emilia  and makes her the Attendant and Friend of  Desdemona  yet shews her stealing a Handkerchief from her which she gives to her Husband telling him at the same Time that the Lady will run mad when she misses it therefore if it is not for some Purpose of Importance that he wants it desires him to return it to her again  If her Husband wants it for any Purpose of Importance that Purpose cannot be very good this Suspicion however never enters her Mind but she gives it him only upon that very Condition which ought to have made her refuse it  Yet this Woman is the first who perceives  Othello  to be jealous and repeats this Observation to her Mistress upon hearing him so often demand the Handkerchief she had stolen and fly into a Rage when he finds his Wife cannot produce it  Emilia  pronounces him jealous perceives the Loss of that fatal Handkerchief confirms some Suspicions he had entertained and though  she loves her Mistress to Excess chuses rather to let her suffer all the bad Consequences of his Jealousy than confess she had taken the Handkerchief which might have set all right again and yet this same Woman who could act so base and cruel a Part against her Mistress has no greater Care in dying than to be laid by her Side  Mr  Rymer  in his Criticisims on this Play severely censures the Characters as well as the Fable and Conduct of the Incidents  That of  Emilia  though more inconsistent than any he has taken no Notice of and most of the Charges he brings against the others have little or no Foundation  The Character of  Iago  says this Critic is against common Sense and Nature  Shakespear  would pass upon us a close dissembling false insinuating Rascal instead of an openhearted frank plain dealing Soldier a Character constantly worn by them for some Thousands of Years in the World  The Soldiers are indeed greatly obliged to Mr  Rymer  for this Assertion but though it may in general be true yet surely it is not absurd to suppose that some few Individuals amongst them may be close dissembling Villains  Iago  was a Soldier it is true but he was also an  Italian  he was born in a Country remarkable for the deep Art Cruelty and revengeful Temper of its Inhabitants To have painted an  Italian  injured or under a Suspicion of being injured and not to have shewn him revengeful  would have been mistaking his Character  It is with Justice indeed that Mr  Rymer  condemns  Shakespear  for that unnecessary and diabolical Cruelty he makes  Iago  guilty of in urging  Othello  to the Murder of the innocent Lady who had never offended him his Point was gained by making  Othello  jealous and procuring his Consent to the Death of  Cassio  who stood in his Way to Preferment But the Murder of  Desdemona  was such an Excess of wanton Cruelty that one can hardly conceive it possible a Man could be so transcendently wicked  Cinthio  indeed makes  Iago  not only urge  Othello  to the Murder of his Wife but is himself the Perpetrator of it this seems still more absurd but he tells us that he had been violently in love with  Disdemona  and the Indifference she had discovered towards him converted his Love into a settled Hatred  Shakespear  injudiciously copies  Cinthio  in making  Iago  confess a Passion for  Desdemona  as it rendered his urging on her Murder less probable since in the Play  Iago  had no Opportunity of declaring that Love to her and consequently could not be stimulated by her Contempt of him to act so cruel a Part against her  But he has greatly improved on the Novelist by making him jealous of the Moor with his own Wife this Circumstance being sufficient in an  Italian  especially to account for the Revenge he takes on  Othello  though his Barbarity to  Desdemona  is still unnatural  Upon the whole there is very little Difference between the Character of the Lieutenant as it is drawn in the Novel and  Iago  as managed in the Play his ambiguous Questions dark Hints and villainous Arts to raise Suspicions in the Mind of  Othello  are the same in the Novel as in the Play and the Scene where  Othello  is made to observe the Gestures of  Cassio  while he is talking to  Iago  is exactly copied from  Cinthio  as is likewise a preceding one where  Othello  tormented with Doubts about his Wife threatens  Iago  with Destruction unless he gives him ocular Proof of her Dishonesty  This Demand with  Iago  's Expostulations Arguments and satisfactory Replies are also the same with those in the Novel  The Character of  Desdemona  fares no better in Mr  Rymer  's Hands than that of  Iago  her Love for the Moor he says is out of Nature  Such Affections are not very common indeed but a very few Instances of them prove that they are not impossible and even in  England  we see some very handsome Women married to Blacks where their Colour is le  s familiar than at  Venice  besides the  Italian  Ladies are remarkable for such Sallies of irregular Passions  Cinthio  it is true says that  Disdemona  was not overcome by a womanish Appetite but represents her as  Shakespear  does likewise subdued by the great Qualities of the Moor  Courage in Men has always had an invincible Charm for the Ladies  Desdemona  admired  the Moor for his Valour and the Transition from extreme Admiration to Love is very easy in a female Mind  Mr  Rymer  alledges that  Shakespear  makes  Desdemona  a Senator's Daughter instead of a simple Citizen and this he imputes to him as a Fault which is perhaps a great Instance of his Judgment  There is less Improbability in supposing a noble Lady educated in Sentiments superior to the Vulgar should fall in love with a Man merely for the Qualities of his Mind than that a mean Citizen should be possessed of such exalted Ideas as to overlook the Disparity of Years and Complexion and be enamoured of Virtue in the Person of a Moor  However it is not true that  Shakespear  has changed a simple Citizen into a Lady of Quality since  Desdemona  in the Novel is mentioned as a Woman of high Birth  Cinthio  calls her  Cittadina  which Mr  Rymer  translates a simple Citizen but the  Italians  by that Phrase mean a Woman of Quality  If they were for Example to speak of a Woman of the middle Rank in  Rome  they would say  Una Romana  if of a noble Lady  Una Cittadina Romana  So in  Venice  they call a simple Citizen  Una Venitiana  but a Woman of Quality  Una Cittadina Veritiana  That Simplicity in the Manners of  Desdemona  which Mr  Rymer  calls Folly and Meanness of Spirit is the Characteristic of Virtue and Innocence  Desdemona  was conscious of no Guilt and therefore suspected no Blame She had so lately given the Moor an incontestable Proof of her Affection that it was not unnatural for her to impute his sudden Starts of Passion to some other Cause than Jealousy  The whole Stress of the Proof against  Desdemona  is laid upon the Handkerchief as well in the Novel as the Play though I think in the Novel it is more artfully managed there the Moor insists upon seeing it in the Captain's Possession e'er he will resolve any Thing against his Wife and the Lieutenant contrives to give him this Satisfaction  Othello  in the Play has not the least Appearance of Proof against his Wife but seeing the Handkerchief in the Lieutenant's Possession yet this is brought about by mere Accident  Bianca  to whom  Cassio  had given it to have the Work copied which by the way was an odd Whim for a Soldier comes to him while he is engaged in a private Discourse with  Iago  and  Othello  observing them concealed and in a Fit of Jealousy throws the Handkerchief at his Head  This happens well for  Iago  's Plot but as he did not and indeed could not foresee this lucky Accident methinks it would have been more natural since every Thing depended upon that to have made it the Effect of some Contrivance of his  The Outlines  Iago Desdemona  and  Cassio  's Characters are taken from the Novel but that of  Othello  is entirely the Poet's own  In  Cinthio  we have a Moor valiant indeed as we are told but suspicious sullen cunning obstinate and cruel  Such a Character married to the fair  Desdemona  must have given Disgust on the Stage the Audience would have been his Enemies and  Desdemona  herself would have sunk into Contempt for chusing him  With what Judgment then has  Shakespear  changed the horrid  Moor  of  Cinthio  into the amiable  Othello  and made the same Actions which we detest in one excite our Compassion in the other  The Virtues of  Shakespear  's  Moor  are no less characteristic than the Vices of  Cinthio  's they are the wild Growth of an uncultivated Mind barbarous and rude as the Clime he is born in thus his Love is almost Phrensy his Friendship Simplicity his Justice cruel and his Remorse SelfMurder  The ninth Novel of the second Day of the Decamerone of  Boccaccio  _SOME  Italian  Merchants meeting at  Paris  whither their different Affairs had brought them they went as was their Custom to sup together at a Tavern and towards the Close of the Entertainment their Spirits being raised by the Wine of which they drank pretty freely they began after having discussed several other Subjects to speak of their Wives whom they had left behind them in their Houses and one of them laughing said  "I know not how my Wife employs herself in my Absence but this I am certain of that when I am at a Distance from her I freely indulge myself in the Pursuit of any young Girl that pleases me and never fail to make myself Master of her Person if I possibly can"  Another replied "that he did the same because added he whether I believe my Wife unfaithful or not she will be so if she pleases"  A Third assured his Companions "that he was of the same Opinion" and in fine they all agreed in declaring "that they believed their Wives would not lose Time in their Absence" except a  Genoese  Merchant named  Bernabo Lomillin  This young Man who was passionately fond of his Wife affirmed "that by the especial Providence of God he had married a Woman so accomplished in all Virtues that  Italy  could scarce produce her Equal"  "Her Person said he is perfectly beautiful she is in the Prime of her Youth and is not only skilled in all domestic Employments fit for a Person of her Rank but she reads writes and discourses upon Business as well as if she was a Merchant she is also wise prudent and amiable and so absolutely chaste that I am persuaded if I was to be absent from her ten Years she would preserve her Fidelity to me inviolable"  This last Praise extremely diverted a young Merchant of  Piacenza  named  Ambrogiuolo  who laughing asked  Bernabo  "if he possessed this Privilege above other Men by a Patent from the Emperor  "This Happiness replied  Bernabo  a little offended is not granted by the Emperor but by God whom I look upon to be little more powerful than the Emperor"  "I do not in the least doubt replied  Ambrogiuolo  but that you believe what you say but you have too little considered the Nature of  Things otherwise you would not be so grossly deceived but would speak less assuredly upon this Matter do you imagine that we who have delivered our Sentiments thus freely of our Wives believe we have married Women whose Dispositions are different from yours no we hold all Women to be alike and the Judgment we have formed of them arises from our having well reflected on their Natures let us then examine this Matter a little"  I have always understood Man to be the noblest Animal of God's Creation and that the Woman holds the next Place if Man therefore as he is generally believed and proves by his Faculties is the nearest to Perfection he must certainly be endowed with more Firmness and Constancy than the Woman who is universally allowed to be a fickle and variable Creature yet since Man with all his Firmness and Constancy cannot resist those Desires which make him seek the Possession of any one that pleases him how canst thou hope that a Woman changeable and unfixed by Nature should be able to resist the Force of Intreaties Praises Gifts and a Thousand other Temptations with which Men who know the Sex endeavour to ensnare them"  "Can you then reflecting upon this Truth believe your Wife faithful"  "I confess though you should tell me you do I could not believe you"  "Is not your Wife a Woman has she not Flesh and Blood as other Women have  are not the same Desires given to her as to others and the same Ability to resist them 'tis therefore possible although she be very virtuous that she may do as others do and you ought not so positively to affirm the contrary"  To this long Speech  Barnabo  replied  "I am a Merchant and not a Philosopher therefore will not pretend to reason with you but this I must say that those Women who are unchaste are so because they have no Sense of Shame and are indifferent about the World's Opinion but Women who are wise and virtuous are so sollicitous to preserve their Honour that they become stronger than Men who take no Care to restrain their irregular Appetites and my Wife is of the Number of those Women who are watchful over their Appetites and sollicitous to preserve their Honour"  "Truly replied  Ambrogiuolo  if every Time a Woman was unfaithful to her Husband a Horn should grow out of her Forehead and bear Witness to the Fact I believe few Women would be guilty of Infidelity but the Horn neither grows nor in Women who manage their Intrigues wisely does there remain the least Trace of their Crime for their Shame does not consist in their Infidelity but in that Infidelity being discovered therefore when they can be unchaste securely they are so and when they are not unchaste 'tis because they are stupid and be assured therefore  that she only is chaste who was never sollicited or being sollicited never yielded"  "And although I am convinced of this Truth by considering in general the Frailty of Human Nature yet I would not speak so positively as I do if I had not many Times and with many different Women proved it beyond Contradiction and I am also persuaded that if I was near thy supremely virtuous Wife I should in a very short Space of Time bring her to that to which I have brought many others"  "It Signifies nothing disputing replied  Barnabo  greatly disturbed Words prove nothing at all but since you say that no Woman is able to resist Sollicitations and are so confident of your own Power with the Sex that you are absolutely certain you can corrupt my Wife I am willing to lose my Head if you succeed in your Attempts upon her Chastity and if you do not you shall lose a Thousand Florins of Gold to me"  "I know not returned  Ambrogiuolo  already fired at his Proposition what I should do with your Head if you lost it to me but if you are willing to have a Proof of what I have maintained do you lay five Thousand Florins of Gold which ought to be less dear to you than your Head against a Thousand of mine and I will oblige myself to go to  Genoa  and in three Months from the Day I depart from hence will prevail upon thy Wife to yield to my Desires and in Token of my  Success will bring with me some of her most precious Things and give you such certain Marks that you yourself shall confess I have accomplished my Design"  "But you must promise me faithfully that you will not come to  Genoa  during my Stay there nor write any Account of this Matter to your Wife"  Bernabo  was extremely pleased with this Proposal but the other Merchants who were present fearing some bad Consequence would arise from such a strange Scheme were very much troubled and endeavoured to prevent its being put into Execution  However the two Persons concerned were so resolutely bent on their Purpose that all Dissuasions were ineffectual and an Obligation in Writing being drawn up they both signed and sealed it in the Presence of their Companions and a few Days after  Ambrogiuolo  went to  Genoa Bernabo  according to his Promise staying at  Paris  to expect his Return  As soon as  Ambrogiuolo  arrived at  Genoa  he began secretly to enquire after the Behaviour and Manner of Life of  Bernabo  's Wife and comparing the Reports of others with what  Bernabo  had told him concerning her he found the Merchant had not been too lavish in her Praises and his Enterprize now appearing even to himself rash and impracticable he was beginning to lose all Hopes of being able to accomplish it when Chance  threw in his Way a poor Woman who was often employed in the House of  Madonna Zinevra  so was the Wife of  Bernabo  called  Ambrogiuolo  corrupting this Woman with a Sum of Money engaged her to assist him in his Design on the Lady  Giving Orders therefore for a Chest to be made after a particular Manner he laid himself into it and the old Woman pretending she had some Business to transact a few Miles out of the Town which would oblige her to stay a Day or two away intreated  Madonna Zinevra  who had a great Kindness for her to let this Chest stand in her BedChamber till she returned the Lady consented and the Chest with  Ambrogiuolo  within it was placed where she desired  Zinevra  retiring to Rest at her usual Hour  Ambrogiuolo  when he was assured that she was asleep came softly out of the Chest into the Chamber and by the Light of a Taper which was burning took particular Notice of the Pictures and Furniture of the Room  Then advancing to the Bed where the Lady and a little Girl that was with her slept very soundly he gently uncovered her and saw that she was no less beautiful naked than drest and as he was thus contemplating her and wishing to discover some particular Mark about her Person which might help him to deceive her Husband he at last spied a large Mole under her left Breast with several Hairs round it of the Colour of Gold  Satisfied with this Discovery he replaced the Cloaths but her Beauty inflaming his Desires he was some Moments in Suspence whether he should not wake her and declare the Cause of his coming thither to be his Love of her  Reflecting however upon the Severity of her Virtue he resolved not to hazard his Life by discovering himself but passed the rest of the Night at his Ease in the Chamber  Day approaching he retired into the Chest taking with him a Purse a Ring and some other Trifles  In this Confinement he passed another Night and the Day following the Woman coming for her Chest he was released and having thus traiterously accomplished his Intentions he left  Genoa  and arrived at  Paris  before the Time prefixed for his Return  Bernabo  and the Merchants who were present at the Wager were summoned by  Ambrogiuolo  and when they were all met he declared he had won the Wager for that the Wife of  Bernabo  had yielded to his Desires producing as a Proof of what he said the Things which he had taken away saying they were given him by the Lady the Furniture of whose BedChamber he also described  Bernabo  confessed that his Description of the BedChamber was right and also that the Things he produced were certainly his Wife's but added that neither of these Circumstances were any Proof of his Wife's Infidelity since  he might by some Stratagem have procured the Knowledge of the one and the Possession of the other and therefore if he had no other Proofs these were insufficient to make him give up the Wager  "These Prooofs replied  Ambrogiuolo  ought to be sufficient but since you will oblige me to produce more I will"  "Madonna Zinevra  your Wife has a large Mole under her left Breast round which there are two or three Hairs of the Colour of Gold"  Bernabo  struck to the Heart by these Words made known by the Change of his Colour and the Rage and Grief which took Possession of his Features that what  Ambrogiuolo  had said was true but a few Minutes after confirming it by his Words  "Gentlemen said he  Ambrogiuolo  has vanquished I confess it and am ready to pay him the Money he has won whenever he comes to demand it"  Accordingly the next Day  Ambrogiuolo  went to the Lodgings of  Bernabo  who paid him the five Thousand Florins and departing from  Paris  went to  Genoa  with a fell Soul against the betrayed  Zinevra  As soon as he arrived he retired to one of his Country Houses at a small Distance from the Town and there calling a faithful Servant he ordered him to get two Horses ready  and carry a Letter from him to his Wife importing his Desires that she should return with the Bearer to him and then gave a strict Command to the Servant to murder her as soon as they came into a convenient Place  The Servant assured him of his Obedience and rode immediately to Town with the Letter which  Zinevra  receiving with great Joy prepared herself for her Journey the next Morning and accompanied only by the Person who came to fetch her she took the Road to her Husband's Villa discoursing as they went upon indifferent Things when coming into a large and solitary Valley surrounded with high Trees the Servant thinking this a fit Place to execute his Master's Orders suddenly stopt and drawing out a large Knife seized the Lady by the Arm  "Madam said he recommend your Soul to God for you must die in a few Moments"  The Lady hearing these dreadful Words and beholding the fatal Knife all trembling with Fear and Surprize cried out  "Oh Mercy gracious Heaven why will you murder me Tell me in what I have offended you that you resolve to kill me"  "Madam replied the Servant you have not offended me in any Thing how you have offended your Husband I know not but he has commanded me to murder you without  Mercy in this Place and if I do not obey him threatens to hang me  "You know by what Tyes I am bound to him and that I have it not in my Power to refuse Compliance with any of his Orders God knows I pity you but I must execute his Will"  "Oh grant me Mercy for the Sake of Heaven replied the Lady all dissolved in Tears do not become a Murderer of one who never injured you to please another  "God from whom nothing is concealed knows I never was guilty of any Action for which I merit this Usage from my Husband but of that no more  "Suffer me only to represent to you how you may at once avoid offending God please your Master and serve me and that in this Manner  "You may give me your upper Coat and Hat and take my Cloaths and returning with them to your Master tell him you have murdered me and I swear to you by that Preservation for which I shall be obliged to you that I will keep myself concealed and wander into some distant Place and neither you or he shall ever hear of me again in this Country"  The Servant who was very unwilling to murder her easily yielded to his Compassion and her Entreaties and gave her his Coat and Hat together with what Money he found about her and after earnestly desiring her to quit  Genoa  as soon as possible took her Cloaths and leaving her alone and on foot in the Valley  returned to his Master to whom he declared "that he had murdered her and that her dead Body was devoured by the Wolves"  The unhappy Lady being alone and disconsolate in the dreary Valley which had been destined for the Scene of her Murder knew not whither to direct her Steps but Night drawing on and her Apprehensions of that dreadful Place encreasing with the approaching Darkness she struck into a foot Path which led at last to a little Village and there going into the Cottage of an old Woman procured some Necessaries fit for her Appearance as a Sailor and thus clad took her Way towards the Shore  There happening to meet with a  Catalonian  Gentleman whose Ship lying near the Place had landed to refresh himself at a Fountain he entering into Discourse with the poor Wanderer supposing her to be a Man at her Request received her as a Servant to wait upon his own Person  Madonna Zinevra  who had taken the Name of  Sicuranno  followed Signor  Encarach  her new Master to his Vessel and having better Cloaths given her began to serve him so diligently and with such Fidelity that he soon conceived a great Esteem for her  Some time after the  Catalonian  sailing with a Cargo to  Alexandria  he took with him some very fine Falcons which he presented to the  Sultan who being pleased with the Gift frequently invited the Merchant to his Table  Sicuranno  always attending his Master upon these Occasions the Sultan was so well pleased with his Carriage and Behaviour that he asked him of the  Catalonian  who though very unwilling to part with him could not refuse the Sultan's Request and therefore left him behind at  Alexandria  Sicuranno  had not been long in the Sultan's Palace before he acquired as great a Share of that Monarch's Confidence and Esteem as of the  Catalonian  's his former Master  It being a Custom at a certain Time of the Year to hold a Fair at  Aeri  a City in the Dominions of the Sultan to which a great many Christians and  Saracen  Merchants resorted the Sultan in whose Favour  Sicuranno  encreased daily appointed him to command the Soldiers that were sent there to guard the Merchants and their Goods while the Fair continued  Sicuranno  being now Captain of the Guard at  Aeri  acquitted himself of this Charge with his accustomed Diligence and Exactness  Among the foreign Merchants which resorted to this Fair there were several  Venetian Placentian Genoese  and other  Italians  with whom  Sicuranno  who still had a great Fondness for his Country frequently conversed  If happened one Day when he was at the Warehouse of the  Venetian  Merchants that among other Trinkets he saw a Purse and a Girdle which he knew to have once belonged to himself he was greatly surprized at the Sight of those Things but concealing it from Observation enquired whose they were and if they were to be sold  Ambrogiuolo  who had come to  Alexandria  with some other Merchants in a  Venetian  Vessel being told that the Captain of the Guard was enquiring about these Things came forward and said with a Smile "Sir the Things are mine and not to be sold but if you have any Inclination for them I will present you with them freely"  Sicuranno  seeing him smile suspected that by some Means or other he had discovered who he was nevertheless keeping a firm Countenance he replied  "You smile I suppose because you see me who am a military Man enquiring about these female Trifles"  "No Sir said  Ambroguiolo  I do not smile at that but at reflecting on the Manner in which I gained those Things"  "Ah I beseech you said  Sicuranno  hastily let us know how you gained them then"  "Sir replied  Ambrogiuolo  these Things were given me by a Lady of  Genoa  called  Madonna Zinevra  the Wife of  Bernabo Lomillin  with whom I had the Honour to pass a Night  in her Husband's Absence and she enteated me to keep them faithfully for her Sake I smile therefore at reflecting on the stupid Folly of her Husband who was silly enough to lay five thousand Florins of Gold against a thousand of mine that it was not in my Power to prevail over the Chastity of his Wife this however I accomplished he lost the Wager and he who ought rather to have punished himself for his Stupidity than his Wife for doing that which all Women will do went to  Genoa  and as I have since heard caused her to be murdered"  Sicuranno  hearing this knew this Man immediately to be the Cause of all his Misery and resolved within himself to be severely revenged on him and in order to acomplish his Design he feigned himself to be extremely well pleased with this Story and began to enter into a strict Intimacy with  Ambrogiuolo  whom he managed so artfully that at last he confessed the whole Truth to him concerning the Stratagem by which he had deceived  Bernabo  and gained the Wager  When the Fair was ended  Sicuranno  by large Promises engaged  Ambrogiuolo  to go with him into  Alexandria  where he procured him a Warehouse and lodged Money in his Hands so that  Ambrogiuolo  thinking he might be able to encrease his Fortune there willingly stayed at  Alexandria  Sicuranno  who ardently desired to have his Innocence made known to  Bernabo  practised  so well with some  Genoese  Merchants who were in that Country that they prevailed upon  Bernabo  who was now reduced to very low Circumstances to come to  Alexandria  and  Sicuranno  caused him to be privately received there by some of his Friends  Sicuranno  who had already made  Ambrogiuolo  recount to the Sultan the Story he had first told him and which had pleased him greatly finding it now a proper Time to execute his Intention since  Bernabo  was arrived took an Opportunity to entreat the Sultan to give Orders that  Ambrogiuolo  and  Bernabo  should be brought before him and to make  Ambrogiuolo  by Menaces if he would not by gentle Methods declare if what he had boasted concerning the Wife of  Bernabo  was true  The Sultan consented and the two Merchants being brought before him he commanded  Ambrogiuolo  with a threatening Countenance to confess truly how he had won the five thousand Florins of  Bernabo  Ambrogiuolo  seeing his Friend  Sicuranno  who was present look upon him with rageful Eyes and threatening him with the most horrid Torments if he did not reveal the Truth pressed on every Side and supposing the worst Consequence of his Confession would be the Restitution of the Money and the Things he related the whole Affair just as it happened and having finished his Narration  Sicuranno  as invested with Authority by the Sultan turned to  Bernabo  and asked him "what  Punishment he had inflicted upon his Wife on Account of that Lye"  "Sir replied  Bernabo  being inflamed with Rage for the Loss of my Money and the Disgrace my Wife's Infamy had brought upon me I ordered a Servant to murder her and according to his Report he did so and her Body was soon after devoured by Wolves"  These Facts thus laid open before the Sultan and all that were present who could not imagine what was to be the End of such an Examidation  Sicuranno  addressing himself to the Sultan said  "My Lord you may plainly perceive by their Confessions what Reason this good Woman had to glory in a Lover and a Husband  "The Lover by an infamous Falshood robs her of her Honour destroys her Fame and deprives her of her Husband and the Husband giving more Credit to the Falshoods of others than to the often experienced Truth of his Wife commands her to be murdered and her dead Body to be devoured by Wolves and so great is the Affection which this Lover and Husband bore her that they both continued with her a long Time and neither of them discovered her  "That you may be able therefore to know this clearly and give to each the Reward they have merited grant me the Favour I am going to implore of you which is to pardon the Deceived and punish the Deceiver and I will then make the injured Lady herself come into your Presence"  The Sultan always disposed to comply with any Request of  Sicuranno  's granted this immediately and desired him to make the Lady come  Bernabo  who firmly believed his Wife to be dead was greatly astonished at this Proposition and  Ambrogiuolo  began now to apprehend he should suffer something worse than paying back the Money  Sicuranno  being thus assured of having her Request granted by the Sultan cast herself at the Feet of that Monarch the Tears fast streaming down her Cheeks and losing with her assumed masculine Voice the Desire of appearing masculine spoke in this Manner  "My Lord in me behold the injured the unhappy  Zinevra  who through the wicked Falshoods of that Traitor  Ambrogiuolo  have been obliged to wander miserably through the World in the Form of a Man and by this cruel Husband doomed to be murdered and devoured by Wolves  Then opening her Waistcoat she discovered her Bosom by which the Sultan and all who were present knowing her to be a Woman were filled with Astonishment and Compassion  Zinevra  then turning to  Ambrogiuolo  fiercely demanded of him "when it was he had seduced her Virtue as he had once openly boasted"  Ambrogiuolo  who now knew her and was struck dumb with Shame and Fear answered nothing  The Sultan who always believed her to be a Man was so astonished at what he now saw and heard that for some Moments he knew not whether all was not a Dream but his Wonder ceasing he began to praise with the highest Expressions of Esteem the Virtue Constancy and unblameable Manners of  Zinevra  and gave Orders to have her magnificently drest in a female Habit appointed Women to attend her and as he had promised pardoned the deceived Husband  Bernabo  who falling at the Feet of his Wife entreated her also with Tears to forgive him  Zinevra  raised him up and kindly assuring him that she would forget all that was past threw herself into his Arms and as her Husband embraced him tenderly  The Sultan then commanded  Ambrogiuolo  to be carried immediately to one of the highest Places in the City and fastened to a Stake his Body to be anointed with Honey and exposed naked to the Sun and there left to die which was accordingly executed after which he ordered all his Effects to be given to  Zinevra  which amounted to ten thousand Pistoles and makeing a magnificent Feast he publicly bestowed the highest Honours and Applauses on  Zinevra  for her Courage and Virtue and presented her Husband and her with ten thousand Pistoles more giving them Leave to depart and a Ship to carry them back to  Genoa  where they soon after arrived extremely rich and were received with great Honours by their Citizens  especially  Madonna Zinevra  who had been thought dead by every one and who from that Time till her Death lived in the highest Reputation for Courage Constancy and Virtue  OBSERVATIONS  on the Use  Shakespear  has made of the foregoing Novel in his Tragedy of  Cymbeline  THE Plot of the foregoing Novel forms one of the Actions of  Shakespear  's Tragedy called  Cymbeline  I say one of the Actions because this Play with his usual Irregularity is composed of three or four different ones  He has copied all those Circumstances from  Boccacio  that were necessary to serve his Design but he has entirely changed the Scene the Characters and the Manners and that he has done so greatly for the worse is I think easy to prove  Boccaccio  introduces some young Merchants in a Tavern where two of them being heated by Wine lay a fantastical Wager one that his Wife was absolutely chaste and not to be corrupted by any Methods whatever  The other that she was frail like the rest of the Sex and that to prove it he would prevail upon her in a very short Time to violate her Faith to her Husband  Shakespear  makes the Lady in Question not the Wife of a Merchant but the Heiress of a great Kingdom  The Husband who lays so indiscreet a Wager not a simple Trader intoxicated with Liquor but a young noble though unfortunate Hero whom for the extraordinary Qualities of his Mind and Person the Princess had secretly married  And the Scenes instead of a Tavern in  Paris  and the House of a private Family in the Court of  Britain  and the Chamber of the Princess  To this injudicious Change of the Characters is owing all the Absurdities of this Part of  Shakespear  's Plot he has given the Manners of a Tradesman's Wife and two Merchants intoxicated with Liquor to a great Princess an  English  Hero and a noble Roman  The King enraged at  Posthumus  for daring to marry his Daughter contents himself with only sending him into Banishment and presses the Princess to take for another Husband a Man whom she detests while her first is only divided from her by a very inconsiderable Distance and while there is a Probability of meeting him again  Since he was so resolutely bent upon making her marry the stupid Son of his second Wife surely it would have more facilitated his Design to have either taken away the Life of  Posthumus  or kept him in a strict and secret Confinement and by that Means  have deprived the Princess of all Hope of ever seeing him but  Posthumus  must only be banished to make Way for the scandalous Wager  This adoring and obliged Husband of a beautiful and virtuous Princess no sooner arrives at  Rome  but he engages in a ridiculous Dispute concerning the Beauty Wit and Chastity of his Lady and tamely suffers one of his  Roman  Friends to maintain that she was as liable to be corrupted as any other of her Sex  The Dispute growing warm the  Roman  engages to take a Journey to  Britain  and corrupt the Chastity of the Princess which if he accomplishes  Posthumus  is to reward him with the Ring that she had given him at parting and to facilitate his Design writes a Letter to the Princess recommending  Jachimo  to her as one of his most valued Friends  Jachimo  accordingly arrives in  Britain  delivers his Letter to the Princess and is very kindly received  It must be observed that the Princess is strictly guarded by the King's Orders and this is very natural since he intended to force her to marry her stupid Stepbrother  But how comes it that this confined Princess guarded by her Father's Guards and watched by her Motherinlaw's Spies should be able to give an Audience to a foreign Stranger who comes from the very Place where her banished Husband resides  We see no Stratagem made use of to elude the Vigilance of her Guards no Bribes given to buy the Secresy of Spies  The Friend of her banished Husband is introduced by his Confident who though known to be so both by the King Queen and Rival of  Posthumus  is still permitted to attend her  This is not indeed very probable but it is absolutely necessary for the Plot because this faithful Confident is to carry the Princess afterwards into a dark Wood in order to kill her by his Master's Orders  So the Story goes in  Boccaccio  so also goes the Plot in the Tragedy  There is only this small Difference that in  Boccacio  it is a private Gentlewoman who attended with one Servant rides a small Journey to meet her Husband at his Country House  But in  Shakespear  it is the Heiress of a great Kingdom who notwithstanding her Guards the Dignity of her Station and Weakness of her Sex rides Post with one Man Servant to a Seaport Town for a short View of her Husband But of this hereafter  Let us see how  Jachimo  begins his Courtship to this great Princess After having insinuated into her Bosom some jealous Suspicions of her Husband's Constancy he goes on to praise her Beauty familiarly enough considering he had but a few Minutes Acquaintance with her Highness  Then begs Leave to "dedicate himself to her sweet Pleasure" and supposing the Bargain concluded offers to kiss her  The Princess calls  Pisanio  her Husband's Confident he happens not to be within hearing and this is very convenient for there is a Necessity for a long Conversation to make all right again for the second Part of  Jachimo  's Stratagem  Her Highness then turns to her impudent Gallant tells him "if he had been honourable he would not have sought such a base End of her" and that she "disdains him and the Devil alike"  The Gallant upon this Lucretialike Denial changes his Note praises the Virtue and Constancy of her Husband and assures her he only made this Attempt on her Chastity in order to try if she was really as pure as she was believed to be  Her Highness is pacified professes herself his faithful Friend and offers him all her Interest in the Court  Jachimo  waves this princely Offer but desires her to allow him to put a Chest of Goods under her Care for one Night to which the Princess consenting assures him his Chest shall be placed in her own BedChamber  Upon this Expedient the whole Plot turns  Jachimo  concealed in the Chest furnishes himself like  Ambrogiuolo  with Proofs of his having dishonoured the Lady and returning to  Posthumus  declares he has won the Wager  Posthumus  satisfied with his Proof though the Honour of a Princess and of a Princess who loved him to Distraction was in Question dispatches Orders to his Servant to kill her and to give him an Opportunity to execute his Commands writes to the Princess that he is at  MilfordHaven  supposing that this Intelligence will bring her immediately to meet him  To pass by the Absurdity of supposing a great Princess guarded by an incensed Father and the jealous Vigilance of a designing StepMother should be able to leave the Court and ride like a MarketWoman with a single Attendant to meet him what Reason had he to expect such a dangerous Proof of Affection from a Woman who had so easily been prevailed upon to violate the Faith she had lately given him  The Wife of  Bernabo  the Merchant might indeed find it necessary to keep herself unsuspected by her Husband since her Happiness depended upon his believing her virtuous  But the Princess's Constancy to  Posthumus  was the Cause of her Disgrace by marrying  Cloten  she might regain her Liberty and consequently have better Opportunities of following her private Intrigues  But what Inducement could she have for incurring the Resentment of the King her Father only to seem constant to a banished Man whom she was dishonouring in private  Her Constancy to  Posthumus  in Defiance of her Father's Anger could only be the Effect of a violent Passion for him but her abandoning herself to a loose Intrigue with his Friend was absolutely inconsistent with her Love for him  If  Posthumus  then believed her unchaste he could not possibly expect she would endeavour to preserve the least Appearance of Fidelity since it was her Interest to abandon him publicly much less endanger her Person by so extraordinary an Effect of Love and Obedience as that he required of her  The injured Princess however is impatient to be on Horseback she whips out of the Palace in a Minute and passes invisibly we cannot help supposing though there is no Inchantment in the Case through the midst of her Attendants and Guards and gallops away to meet her Husband  When she arrives in the destined Wood  Pisanio  acquaints her with the Orders he had received to kill her and his fixed Resolution not to obey them  The Princess indeed puts a very pertinent Question to him  Imo  Wherefore then  Didst undertake it why hast thou abused  So many Miles with a Pretence this Place  Mine Action and thine own our Horses labour  The Time inviting thee the perturb'd Court  For my being absent whereunto I never  Purpose return Why hast thou gone so far  To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy Stand  Th' elected Deer before thee  Shakespear  no doubt foresaw his Readers would ask this Question if the Princess did not but though he found it an easy Matter to make  Pisanio  satisfy her as to that Particular the Reader is not so easily answered  For why indeed did he bring her into so shocking a Situation if he resolved not to murder her Why did he not acquaint her with the cruel Orders of her Husband while she was in her Father's Palace  If it was a bold and hazardous Action to quit the Court in such a strange Equipage to have a short Conference with a faithful Husband why must she expose herself to so eminent a Danger only to be told of the Cruelty and Injustice of that Husband  But the Truth is she has a great many strange Adventures to come yet and these must be brought about at the Expence of Probability  But what Resolution does the Heiress of  Britain  take after being told that her Husband believing her to be an Adulteress had ordered her to be killed  One would imagine that full of a just Disdain for so vile and scandalous a Suspicion the Pride of injured Virtue affronted Dignity and Rage of ill requited Love would have carried her back to the Court there by disclaiming all future Faith and Tenderness for  the unworthy  Posthumus  restore herself to the Affection of her Father and all the Rights of her royal Birth  No she only weeps complains reproaches a little and then resolves to dress herself in the Habit of a Boy and wander afoot to procure a Service  Here  Shakespear  drops  Boccacio  after having servilely copied from him all the Incidents which compose this Part of the Plot of  Cymbeline  but by changing the Scene and Characters has made these Incidents absurd unnatural and improbable  The rest of the Play is equally inconsistent and if  Shakespear  invented here for himself his Imagination is in this one Instance full as bad as his Judgment  His Princess forgetting that she had put on Boy's Cloaths to be a Spy upon the Actions of her Husband commences Cook to two young Forresters and their Father who live in a Cave and we are told how nicely she sauced the Broths  Guid  "But his neat Cookery  Arv  He cut our Roots in Characters  And sauc'd our Broth as  Juno  had been sick  And he her Dieter  Certainly this Princess had a most oeconomical Education however she is to change her Situation seem dead be buried and come to Life again and hire herself to a new Master"  To bring all this about  Shakespear  makes her drink a Potion resembling that of  Juliet  's in its Effects this Potion is tempered by the Queen's Physician whom she had desired to prepare her a Poison  Pisanio  being in the Queen's Apartment when the Drug was brought in looked earnestly at it which the Queen observing desired him to accept of it telling him it was a fine Cordial  The Physician who is by whispers  Pisanio  that the Queen having desired him to prepare her some mortal Poison he had given her a Drug which would only make the Person that drank of it fall into a Sleep resembling Death  One would think  Pisanio  was sufficiently warned yet we find him giving this Drug to the Princess when he left her in the Wood assuring her it was a rich Cordial given him by the Queen and intreating her to drink some of it when she was sick  This Blunder however produces a great many other Events  Imogen  thought to be dead is buried by the young Foresters who are her Brothers though unknown in the Wood  Cloten  follows the Princess with an Intention as he declares "to ravish her and then kick her back to Court" and is disguised in the Cloaths of  Posthumus  though there is no other Reason for his being thus disguised but only that the Princess may afterwards suppose him  Posthumus  when she finds him dead Being afterwards killed by the Brothers of  Imogen  one of them cuts off his Head and buries him beside the supposed Youth  It may seem a little shocking for a generous young Man a Prince though he did not know as himself to cut off the Head of his Enemy it ter having killed him but his Head must be cut off or else how could  Imogen  mistake him for her Lord  The Princess awaking from her Trance supposes she is travelling to  MilfordHaven  and cries "Ods pittikens is it six Miles yet" recovering her Senses perfectly and seeing a headless Man lying near drest in the Cloaths of  Posthumus  she laments over him believing him to be her Husband  This is indeed a very pathetic Distress but what does the unhappy Heiress of  Britain  do now she thinks her Husband is killed Why she accepts the Post of Page to the Enemy of her Father and Country who with a hostile Army is wasting the Kingdom over which by Right of Birth she is to reign  But why does the Princess disgrace her Sex and Dignity by accepting so scandalous an Employment Is it the Fear of Death from the  Romans  No certainly there is no such Thing threatened  Besides a Lady fond to Distraction of a Husband whom she finds lying murdered by her can hardly be supposed so attentive to her own Danger in those distressful Moments as to provide so cunnningly for her Safety  However the Princess full of Despair as she is dresses up a clever Tale in a Trice invents a Name for her murdered Husband calls herself his Page says he was slain by  Mountaineers and expresses her Fears that she should never get so good a Master  Hereupon  Lucius  takes her to be his Page and her Highness goes off very well contented with her Situation  It would be an endless Task to take Notice of all the Absurdities in the Plot and unnatural Manners in the Characters of this Play  Such as the ridiculous Story of the King's two Sons being stolen in their Infancy from the Court and bred up in the Mountains of Wales till they were twenty Years of Age  Then at their first Essay in Arms these Striplings stop the King's Army which is flying from the victorious  Romans  oblige them to face their Enemies and gain a compleat Victory  With Inconsistencies like these it every where abounds the whole Conduct of the Play is absurd and ridiculous to the last Degree and with all the Liberties  Shakespear  has taken with Time place and Action the Story as he has managed it is more improbable than a Fairy Tale  As Mr  Pope  observes little more than the Names in this Play is historical  Hollingshead  says in his Chronicle "that  Cymbeline  was in such Favour with  Augustus Caesar  whom he had served in the Wars that he left him at Liberty either to pay or not to pay his Tribute as he pleased" which Circumstance is thus used by  Shakespear  Augustus  sends to demand the Payment of the Tr  bute which had been by the wicked Counsels of the King's second Wife neglected  Cymbeline  according to the Queen's Directions refuses to pay it Hereupon War is declared an Army of  Romans  comes into  Britain  the King's Forces are put to Flight but being rallied and led on again by two Boys in a narrow Lane they give the  Romans  a total Defeat and take their General Prisoner and after this Victory the King pays the Tribute which he had before so peremptorily refused  The ninth Novel of the third Day of the Decamerone of  Boccaccio  _A Nobleman of the Kingdom of  France  named  Esnard  Count of  Roussillon  being of a weak and sickly Constitution always kept a Physician named  Gerard de Narbonne  in his House This Count had one only Son called  Bertrand  he was extremely handsome and of a sweet and gentle Disposition the Count caused several young Boys of his Age to be educated with him among whom there was also a little Girl named  Giletta  Daughter to the Physician  This Girl loved  Bertrand  with a Tenderness and Ardor very uncommon to one of her Age  The Count dying left his Son under the Guardianship of the King and his Majesty sending Orders for him to come to  Paris Giletta  whose Affection encreased with her  Years remained in the utmost Affliction at  Roussillon  The Physician dying soon after the young Count's Departure  Giletta  would have set out for  Paris  to see her beloved  Bertrand  but being a great Fortune her Conduct was carefully watched and not being able to find a reasonable Excuse for such a Journey she was obliged for the present to quit her Design  Growing now of Years fit to be married her Relations proposed several Matches to her which she without explaining the true Cause refused the secret Passion she had long felt for  Bertrand  gaining Strength by the Reports she had continually heard of his extraordinary Beauty and Accomplishments she resolved never to give her Hand to any other Man  But while she was languishing with a hopeless Desire of seeing the Count News came that the King of  France  was extremely ill a Swelling in his Stomach having been badly treated had turned to a Fistula and the Anguish he felt from his Distemper was encreased by his Despair of ever getting it cured no Physician being found that was able to remove it notwithstanding great Numbers had been tried who had all left it worse than before  The King therefore in the utmost Despair at their bad Success would no longer admit of Advice or Assistance  Giletta  overjoyed at this News thought she had now not only a good Excuse for going to  Paris  but if the King's Distemper was  what she believed it to be there was also a Possibility of gaining  Bertrand  for a Husband  Her Father having discovered to her many valuable Secrets of his Art she made a Powder of a certain Herb which she had been taught by him was a Remedy for the Disease she imagined the King was afflicted with and privately getting a Horse prepared for her went immediately to  Paris  Her first Care after her Arrival was to gain a Sight of her dear  Bertrand  and then procuring an Audience of the King she earnestly entreated him to let her look at the Swelling  The King seeing her so young and handsome could not refuse her Request as soon as she saw it she immediately entertained Hopes of curing him and said "Sire if you are willing I trust in God I shall be able without giving you much Pain or Fatigue to cure you of this Distemper in eight Days"  The King laughing at these solemn Assurances replied "Since the greatest Physicians in the World have not been able to cure me how is it possible a young Woman should perform what was too difficult for them I give you thanks for your good Will but I am determined never more to follow any Prescription whatever"  "Sire replied  Giletta  you despise my Art because I am young and a Woman I am not indeed a Physician nor is it by my own Knowledge that I pretend to cure you but by the Help of God and the Knowledge of  Gerard  de Narbonne  who was my Father and when he was alive a celebrated Physician"  The King being moved with these Words began to reason with himself in this Manner  "This Woman perhaps is sent by Providence for my Relief ought I not at least to try what she can do especially since she says she will cure me in a little Time and that too without much Pain" Then having taken his Resolution he said "But Damsel if after having made me break through my Resolves you do dot cure me what Punishment are you willing to submit to"  "Sire answered  Giletta  make me be carefully guarded and if after the Expiration of eight Days I do not cure you sentence me to be burnt but if I do cure you what shall be my Recompence"  "You seem to me said the King to be still unmarried if you perform what you have promised I will give you a rich and honourable Husband"  "Truly Sire said  Giletta  I am very well pleased with your Design of marrying me but I must be at Liberty to name my Husband and no Person whatever except those of the Royal Blood must be refused me"  The King agreed to her Request immediately and promised her it should be punctually complied with  Giletta  thereupon began to administer her Medicine which she pursued so happily that before the Time prefixed she restored him to Health  The King feeling himself perfectly cured said to her "Damsel you have well gained your Husband" "Then Sire she replied I have gained  Bertrand  Count of  Roussillon  whom I began to love in my Infancy and have ever since loved with the most ardent Affection  The King thought her Demand very high but as he had given his Promise he was resolved not to break it and ordered  Bertrand  to be called to whom he said "Count you are now grown a Man and perfected in all the Accomplishments of a Nobleman it is my Will therefore that you should take upon you the Government of your Country and carry with you the Damsel I have given you for a Wife" "And who is that Damsel Sire replied the Count" "That is she said the King who with her Medicines has restored me to Health"  Bertrand  as soon as he looked upon her immediately remembered her and though her Person appeared to him extremely handsome yet sensible of the Disproportion of her Birth to his he answered with great Disdain "What Sire would you give me a female Quack for a Wife' God forbid I should ever be the Husband of such a Woman"  "Will you then replied the King make me break my Word with this young Maid who demanded you for a Husband in Reward for restoring me to Health  "Sire replied  Bertrand  you may take away all I possess and by the Power you have over me give me to whom you please  but it is certain I never shall be contented with such a Marriage"  "You will be happy no doubt replied the King the Damsel is fair and wise she loves you ardently and I hope you will enjoy a more agreeable Life with her than with a Lady of noble Birth"  Bertrand  being silent the King gave Orders to make great Preparations for the Nuptials and when the determined Day came  Bertrand  though unwillingly married  Giletta  in the Presence of the King  The Ceremony over the Count having taken his Resolution desired the King's Permission to return to his Country there to consummate the Marriage The King granting his Request he mounted his Horse but instead of going to  Roussillon  went into  Tuscany  and knowing that the  Florentines  were at War with the Republic of  Sienna  he offered his Service to the first who received him gladly paid him great Honours and gave him the Command of a Regiment with large Appointments which prevailed upon him to continue in their Service  In the mean time the newmarried Lady little pleased with such a Disappointment flattered herself that by her prudent Behaviour she should be able to recall him and being received at  Roussillon  with all the Honours due to the Wife of Count  Bertrand  she applied herself in the Absence of her Lord to the Management of his Affairs which she performed with so much Solicitude and Discretion that  all the People at  Roussillon  were extremely pleased with her wise Government held her in the utmost Esteem and Affection and greatly blamed their Lord for his unkind Behaviour to her  Having put every Thing at  Roussillon  into exact Order she sent two Gentlemen to her Lord whom she ordered to acquaint him that if her Presence was the Cause of his Absence from his Country to make him easy and to engage him to return she would quit  Roussillon  for ever To this Messuage the Count replied with great Harshness  "Tell her she may do what she pleases and assure her that I am determined never to live with her as my Wife till she gets this Ring which I wear on my Finger into her Possession and has a Son begot by me in her Arms both which cannot possibly happen as I never intend to see her more"  The two Gentlemen thought these hard Conditions and after long solliciting him in vain to change his Purpose returned to the Lady and related to her his Answer  The unhappy  Giletta  greatly afflicted at this Account deliberated with herself a long Time on the Means she should use to accomplish those two Things and retrieve her Husband  After much Thought she at last assembled all the best and wisest of the Count's Subjects and in very moving Language related all she had done through her Affection for the Count his Disdain of her his Unkindness and obstinate Resolution never to live  with her and lastly declared that she was determined not to keep her Lord in perpetual Banishment by her Stay at  Roussillan  but to retire and pass the remainder of her Life in Pilgrimage and devout Works for the Salvation of her Soul intreating them to take great Care of the Affairs of the Country and to signify to their Lord that she had quitted  Roussillon  with a fixed Resolution never to return thither any more  While she was speaking many Tears were shed by the good People to whom she addressed herself who all humbly intreated her to change her Resolution and continue among them but she was immoveable and recommending them to God took Leave of them  Then furnishing herself with Money and rich Jewels she set out in the Habit of a Pilgrim attended by a Chambermaid and one of her Cousins and took the Road to  Florence  never stopping till she reached that City  Arriving there she hired a Lodging in a Inn which was kept by a good Widow and passing for a poor Pilgrim remained there in Hopes of hearing something about her Lord  She had not been long in the Inn when  Bertrand  happened to pass by the Door on Horseback with a great Retinue  Giletta  knew him immediately but endeavouring to suppress the Emotions his unexpected Sight gave her she took Occasion as he passed to enquire of her Landlady his Name and Condition  Who replied that he was a Foreigner called Count  Bertrand  remarkable for his Politeness and Affability and added that he was very much in love with a Neighbour of hers a young Woman well born and very virtuous but so poor that no one was willing to marry her and that her Mother being a discreet sensible Woman perceiving the Count's Passion for her Daughter took great Care to preserve her from his dishonourable Attempts  The Countess after enquiring and getting all the Information she was able from her Landlady concerning this Woman and her Daughter retired to reflect upon what she had heard and weighing well every Particular Circumstance in her Mind she conceived a Design of turning the Count's Infidelity to her own Advantage  But concealing her Intentions from her two Attendants she went privately one Day in her Pilgrim's Habit to the House of her Rival and easily getting Admittance found her Landlady had not misrepresented the Condition of these good People whose extream Poverty was very discernible from every Thing about them  The Countess on her Entrance saluted the Mother with great Civility and desired the Favour of some private Discourse with her  The Gentlewoman rising told her she was ready to hear her and led her into another  Chamber where as soon as they were seated the Countess began in this Manner  "My good Lady I perceive that Fortune is as much your Enemy as mine but if you are willing 'tis in your Power to give yourself as well as me Consolation"  The good Woman replied "that she desired nothing so much as to procure herself Relief provided she could do it honestly"  "'Tis necessary then said the Countess that I should rely on your Fidelity but if you deceive me you will ruin my Design and hurt your own Interest"  "You may tell me whatever you please with great Secresy replied the Gentlewoman you shall never find me deceitful"  "The Countess then beginning her Story with her Love of Count  Bertrand  while she was yet a Child pursued it through all its Circumstances till she brought it down to the present Time relating every Thing in so affecting and artless a Manner that the good Woman could not doubt the Truth of what she said and began to have great Compassion for her  "'Tis only by your Means added the Countess that I can accomplish those two Conditions upon which my Happiness depends if what I hear be true that my Husband loves your Daughter"  "I know not Madam replied the Gentlewoman whether the Count really loves my Daughter but I know that he makes great  Professions of it but what is it you would desire of me how is it in my Power to serve you"  "I will tell you replied the Countess but first you must let me know how I shall return the Obligation you are able to confer upon me"  "I see your Daughter is handsome and old enough to be married and by what I have heard and now observe you keep her at Home for want of a Portion to marry her I intend therefore to reward the Service you may do me by giving her immediately as much Money as you shall think necessary to marry her honourably"  The good Woman who was in great Necessity was pleased with the Offer but being cautious and discreet replied  "Madam tell me what it is you require of me and if I can do it honestly I will and you shall afterwards make what Acknowledgments you please"  "You must then said the Countess send some Person in whom you can confide to Count  Bertrand  to let him know that your Daughter will consent to his Desires but that in order to be convinced of the Truth of that Passion he pretends for her he must send by her Messenger that Ring which he wears on his Finger and that done she will be ready to grant all he requires  "This Message will certainly bring him to your House I will be concealed in your Daughter's Chamber and supply her Place  perhaps I may be so fortunate as to prove with Child by him and thus by your Assistance having the Ring on my Finger and a Child in my Arms begat by him I may at last acquire his Affection and prevail with him to live with me for the future as his Wife"  The good Woman was at first startled at this Request of the Countess's fearing her Daughter's Reputation might suffer if she complied with it  But reflecting that it would be a good Action to procure the Love of a Husband to a Wife that deserved it she not only promised the Countess to perform all she desired but in a few Days sent a Messenger with great Secresy to the Count who hearing the Message notwithstanding he thought it hard to give away his Ring complied with his Mistress's Command and came to her Appointment  Giletta  being dextrously conveyed into the Chamber instead of the young Woman the Count passed the Night with her retiring very early the next Morning for fear of giving any Occasion for Slander but he renewed his Visits every Night always believing it was his beloved Mistress who received him  The Countess finding herself with Child would no longer admit the nightly Visits of her Husband and calling for her Benefactress said  "Madam I have Thanks to God and your Assistance accomplished what I desired  and it is now Time to know what I can do for you in Return"  The good Woman told her she might do what she pleased but that for her Part she desired no Reward for the Service she had done her having only in her Opinion done what she ought  The Countess expressed herself pleased with her modest Reply but insisted upon her naming a Portion for her Daughter  The Gentlewoman thus constrained with great Hesitation and much Shame asked a hundred Pounds  The Countess seeing her Confusion and admiring the Moderation of her Demand gave her five Hundred Pounds in Money and Jewels to the Value of five Hundred more and taking Leave of the Mother and Daughter returned to her Inn  The good Woman who was enriched greatly beyond her Expectations sent Word to the Count to forbear his Visits and retired with her Daughter into the Country to some of her Relations  Bertrand  being informed that his Wise had left  Roussillon  yielded to the Desires of his People and went thither which the Countess hearing was extremely pleased and resolved to stay at  Florence  till she was brought to Bed  When the Time was expired she was delivered of two Sons both very like their Father and as soon as she was able to bear the Fatigue of Travelling she left  Florence  and  came without being known by any one to  Montpellier  there she rested two or three Days and then with her Children took the Road to  Roussillon  On her Arrival she enquired after the Health of her Lord and hearing that he was well and was that Day giving a great Feast to some Noblemen and Ladies in his Palace she presented herself in the Hall where they were all assembled wearing the Habit of a Pilgrim in which she had left  Roussillon  and holding her two Sons in her Arms Then throwing herself at the Feet of her Husband with Tears streaming from her Eyes she said  "My Lord I am your unhappy Wife who abandoned by you did notwithstanding apply myself diligently to the Management of your Affairs I have long wandered miserably about the World and now come to demand you in the Name of God since I have been able to accomplish those two Conditions you proposed by the Gentleman I sent to you look on me my Lord and behold in my Arms not only one Son by you but two behold likewise your Ring and according to your Promise receive and acknowledge me for your Wife  The Count who had listened attentively to her was struck motionless with Astonishment He knew the Ring and observed the Children to be very like him and wholly lost in the Perplexity into which those Accidents had thrown him he asked her how it could be  The Countess then to the great Amazement of her Lord and all who were present related every Circumstance that had happened to her since her Departure from  Roussillon  Bertrand  being convinced of the Truth of what she said was struck with her Perseverance and Wisdom and gazing on the Children which he knew by their Resemblance to him to be his own mindful of the Promise he had made her and moved with the Remonstrances of the Ladies and Gentlemen that were with him and the Intreaties of his People who all conjured him to receive and acknowledge her his Obstinacy at last gave Way  He raised the Countess from her Knees embraced her tenderly acknowledged her to be his lawful Wife and the Children she brought with her his Sons And then giving Orders for her being drest according to her Rank and Fortune passed the rest of that Day and many others following in Feasting and rejoycing to the great Satisfaction of all the People in  Roussillon  From this Time he always lived with her as his Wife esteemed and honoured her for her Virtues and loved her with the greatest Degree of Tenderness  OBSERVATIONS  on the Use  Shakespear  has made of the foregoing Novel in his Comedy of  All's Well that ends Well  The Fable of  All's Well that ends Well  BERTRAM  the young Count of  Roussillon  having lost his Father is left under the Guardianship of the King of  France  who sends Orders for him to come to Court  Helena  the Daughter of a famous Physician lately deceased being violently in Love with the Count resolves to follow him to  Paris  The old Countess of  Roussillon  Mother to  Bertram  who is very fond of  Helena  being informed that she was in Love with her Son questions her about it which after some evasive Answers she at last confesses and also acknowledges her Intention to go to  Paris  to offer her Service to cure the King who was sick of a Fistula which by his Physicians was pronounced incurable  The Countess permits her to go and the King after many Intreaties submits to make Use of her Medicine which effects his Cure  Helena  before the Trial obliges the King to promise that if he was restored to Health by  her Applications he would give her her Choice of a Husband among those Persons he had a Right to dispose of  Accordingly when the Cure is compleated she demands Count  Bertram  The King orders him to marry her he refuses on account of the meanness of her Birth the King insisting upon his Obedience  Bertram  at last complies and seemingly with great Willingness but when the Ceremony is performed declares to a Confident that he hates his new Wife and is determined never to live with her but will go to the Wars in  Tuscany  to avoid it  He then sends a flattering Message to  Helena  and desires that she will take Leave of the King immediately and give him to understand that this sudden Parting proceeds from her own earnest Inclinations to be gone  Helena  complies with this Injunction and meeting her Lord he excuses his Absence for two Days to her gives her a Letter to carry to his Mother and bids her hasten to  Roussillon  She departs and he having thus got rid of her steals immediately to  Florence  The old Countess of  Roussillon  is extremely enraged at the Contents of her Son's Letter which informs her that he is determined never to live with his new Wife and a Billet is delivered to  Helena  also upon her Arrival at  Roussillon  containing these Words "When thou canst get the Ring upon my Finger which never shall come off and  shew me a Child begotten of thy Body that I am Father to then call me Husband but in such a then I write never"  Helena  in Despair at this cruel Epistle and desirous that her Presence might not banish her Lord from  Roussillon  steals away at Night leaving a Letter for her Motherinlaw in which she informs her that she is gone a barefoot Pilgrimage to St  Jaques  entreats her to recall her Son from the Wars and declares "that she is going to embrace Death to give him Freedom" however she stops at  Florence  meets with a Widow whose Daughter  Diana  the Count was in Love with and prevailing upon these two Women by large Sums of Money to assist her in her Design upon her Husband she supplies  Diana  's Place in the Assignation she had made by her Advice with the Count and gets the Ring which he had presented her in her own Possession giving him in Return another which she had received from the King  A feigned Account of her Death confirmed by the Rector of the Place where she died being carried to  Roussillon  the old Countess sends the News to her Son entreating him to return which he does immediately and the King being then at  Roussillon  pardons the Count for his unkind Usage of  Helena  whose Loss he seems greatly to regret and the Daughter of an old Lord named  Lafeu  is proposed to him for a second Wife  Bertram  eagerly embraces the Proposal declaring "he had been violently in Love with  the young Lady which was the Cause of his Contempt for  Helena"  The Match being concluded on  Lafeu  desires his intended Soninlaw to give him some Token to send his Daughter upon which the Count presents him with the Ring he had received from the supposed  Diana  Lafeu  immediately recollects that he had seen that Ring upon  Helena  's Finger and the King looking at it immediately declares that it was the same he had given her at parting  Bertram  assures them they were mistaken that the Ring never was  Helena  's but thrown to him from a Window in  Florence  by a Lady who was in Love with him  The King alarmed by these Falshoods entertains a Suspicion that  Bertram  had murdered his Wife and sends him to Prison  In the mean Time  Helena  finding herself with Child rides post with the Widow and her Daughter to  Marseilles  where she had been informed the King was  On her Arrival she is told the King is at  Roussillon  and meeting with a Gentleman belonging to the Court who was going there she delivers a Petition to him entreating him to present it to the King the Gentleman promises to do so and  Helena  and her Associates follow him to  Roussillon  The Gentleman arrives with the Petition just as the Count is carried off guarded and the King receiving it reads it aloud it is signed  Diana Capulet  who accuses the Count of having debauched her at  Florence  under a Promise of Marriage when his Wife died the  Performance of which she now claims  Helena  being dead and entreats the King would oblige him to do her Justice the Count is brought again into the King's Prefence and  Diana  and her Mother appear to make good the Charge against him which he denies and calls his deified  Diana  a common Strumpet  Diana  then produces the Ring which he had given  Helena  when she met him in her stead and claims the other which the Count had declared was thrown to him from a Window and says that she gave it him in Bed the Count then acknowledges the Ring was her's the King who knew it was the same he had given to  Helena  asks her if it was her's she provokes him by her evasive and contradictory Answers and he orders her to be carried to Prison  Diana  desires her Mother to get Bail for her and immediately  Helena  appears and tells her Lord she had accomplished both the Conditions he had imposed on her gives him back his Ring and declares she is with Child upon which  Bertram  promises to love her for the future dearly and the King takes upon himself the Care of providing  Diana  with a Husband and paying her Portion  Shakespear  in his Comedy of  All's Well that Ends Well  has followed pretty exactly the Thread of the Story in the foregoing Novel  He has made Use of all the Incidents he found there and added some of his own which possibly may not be thought any Proofs  either of his Invention or Judgment since at the same Time that they grow out of those he found formed to his Hand yet they grow like Excrescences and are equally useless and disagreeable  The supposed Death of  Giletta  as she is called in the Novel or  Helena  as she is named in the Play is wholly an Invention of  Shakespear  yet it produces nothing but a few Ambiguities in the Dialogue which are far from entertaining and a base Suspicion of the Count's having murdered her which he bears with a Tameness unbecoming the Character of a brave Soldier and a haughty Nobleman  The Catastrophe of the Story though the same in the Play as the Novel yet is very differently conducted in each There is more Probability in the Incidents which lead to it in the Novel and more Contrivance in those of the Play  The Reconciliation between the Count and his Lady is very natural and affecting in  Boccace  in  Shakespear  it is lost amidst a Croud of perplexing and in my Opinion uninteresting Circumstances  The Character of the Heroine is more exalted in the Original than the Copy  In  Boccace  we see her after her Marriage and the cruel Flight of her Husband taking the Government of the Province in her own Hands and behaving with so much Wisdom Prudence and Magnanimity as acquired her the Love and Esteem of the People who all  murmured against the Injustice of their Lord in not being sensible to so much Merit nor does she endeavour to procure his Affection by a Stratagem till she has given Proofs that she deserved it  Shakespear  shews her oppressed with Despair at the Absence of the Count incapable of either Advice or Consolation giving unnecessary Pain to the good Countess her Motherinlaw a Character entirely of his own Invention by alarming her with a pretended Design of killing herself and by some Means or other which we are not acquainted with gets the Rector of the Place to whom she had vowed a Pilgrimage which by the Way she does not perform to confirm the Report of her Death  After having accomplished her Design of bedding with her Husband and procuring the Ring she rides Post to  Marseilles  with the Widow and her Daughter on Purpose to expose her beloved Husband to the King's Resentment and the Contempt of all the Courtiers who were present by making  Diana  complain to the King of the Count's having debauched her under a Promise of Marriage when his Wife was dead  After she has thus exposed the Frailties of her Husband she has the Cruelty to suffer him to be accused of having murdered her and in Consequence of that Accusation seized and imprisoned by the King's Order  The Discovery of her Plot is attended with none of those affecting Circumstances we find in the Original  After having made him endure so much Shame and Affliction she haughtily demands his Affection as a Prize she had lawfully won  In  Boccace  she knéels she weeps she persuades and if she demands she demands with Humility  In  Shakespear  she is cruel artful and insolent and ready to make Use of the King's Authority to force her Husband to do her Justice  The Character of  Helena  being thus managed in the Play  Shakespear  has with Art made the old Countess who is an amiable Character bear Witness to the Virtues of  Helena  for otherwise we should not have discovered them we must therefore take her Word for it that her Daughterinlaw is wise gentle prudent and virtuous for except her extreme Cunning she has nothing striking in her Character and except her Perseverance nothing amiable  It is indeed surprizing that  Shakespear  as he has followed so exactly the Copy of  Boccace  should deviate from him so much in the Character of the two principal Persons in his Play whom at the same Time he intends as well as the Novelist to make happy  The Count suffers rather more in his Hands than the Lady in the Novel his greatest Fault is flying from a Woman he had married and  taking a Resolution never to live with her but upon Conditions he himself was determined to render impossible  Yet this Behaviour admits of much Extenuation The Woman he had married was forced upon him by the absolute Authority of the King her Birth was greatly inferior to his her Person had not attracted his Attention he had no Inducement to love her on the contrary he had great Reason to be offended with her for forcing herself ungenerously as he thought upon him  Her Behaviour indeed after his leaving her merited his Affection but he was then in love with another Woman and incapable of listening to the Dictates of his Reason and when he does yield to acknowledge her For his Wife he yields to the Force of Conviction he loves her because he is persuaded she merits it and accordingly that Love is pure and lasting  In  Shakespear  when the King offers her to him for a Wife he refuses her with great Coarseness and many contemptuous Expressions yet upon the King's exerting his Authority meanly submits and contradicts his former avowed Sentiments  After his Marriage he declares his continued Hatred for her to his Friends yet condescends to dissemble unworthily with her to get rid of her  In  Florence  he attempts to corrupt a young Woman of good Family and Reputation and succeeding as he imagined openly boasts of it  Upon the News of his Wife's Death of which he thinks himself the Cause he expresses great Joy and without taking Leave of the young Woman he supposes he has debauched hastens back to  Roussillon  There a Marriage being proposed to him with the Daughter of an old Courtier he accepts it immediately declaring his Passion for that young Lady which he durst never reveal was the Cause of his Hatred to  Helena  A very improbable Tale because his Quality set him above a Refusal from any Lady and he is represented to be passionately in Love at  Florence  But to go on when  Diana  his  Florentine  Flame presents by the Contrivance of his Wife a Petition to the King informing him that the Count had debauched her by a Promise of Marriage and then cruelly stole away from her the Count denies the Charge and is base enough to defame the Woman he had ruined calling her a common Creature and infamous Prostitute and in the Course of his Examination invents several ridiculous Lies  Upon the Appearance of his Wife he acknowledges all meanly begs Pardon of both and promises to love his Wife for the future dearly  It is not easy to conceive a Reason why  Shakespear  has thus mangled the Characters of  Boccace  when except in a few trifling Circumstances he has so faithfully followed the Story  It was not necessary to make  Helena  less amiable or the Count more wicked in the Play than the Novel since the Intrigue in both is exactly the same and certainly he has violated all the Rules of poetical Justice in conducting by a Variety of Incidents the two principal Persons of the Play to Happiness when they both though with some Inequality merited nothing but Punishment  The Thirtysixth Novel of  Bandello  Volume the Second  _WHEN the Imperial City of  Rome  was taken and sacked by the united Arms of  Spain  and  Germany  a rich Merchant of  Esi  named  Ambrogio  was taken Prisoner among the rest of the Inhabitants This Merchant by a Wife who was lately dead had two Children a Boy and a Girl both beyond all Imagination beautiful and so like each other that when they were both dressed in Boy's or Girl's Cloaths it was difficult to know the one from the other so that the Father himself who for his Diversion often tried the Experiment was extremely puzzled to distinguish them  Ambrogio  who loved them with great Affection spared no Expence in their Education but caused them to be taught every Thing that was fit for their Birth and Fortune  At the Time that  Rome  was sacked they were about fifteen Years of Age  Paolo  so was the Boy called was taken Prisoner by a certain  German  who for his great personal Valour was held in high Esteem by his Nation  This Man having taken several other Prisoners of considerable Rank drew large Sums for their Ransom his Share of the Plunder had also been very great having got a large Quantity of Gold and Silver Plate many rich Jewels and Cloaths so that being very well satisfied with his Gain he lest  Rome  and went to  Naples  taking with him his little Captive  Paolo  whom he loved and treated like his own Son  The twin Sister of  Paolo  who was called  Nicuola  fell into the Hands of two  Spanish  Soldiers and Fortune was so favourable to her that upon her telling them she was Daughter to a very rich Man they treated her with great Respect in Expectation of receiving a considerable Sum for her Ransom  Ambrogio  through the Favour of some  Neapolitan  Friends who were in the  Spanish  Troops avoided Captivity and had also an Opportunity given him of concealing the greatest Part of his Treasure in a subterraneous Vault but what remained in his House was pillaged  This Loss he bore with great Indifference Grief for his Children's Captivity and his Endeavours to find them taking up all his Thoughts  After a diligent Search he at length found  Nicuola  whom he redeemed for five Hundred Ducats but all the Methods he could use to discover where  Paolo  was proving ineffectual he began to fear he was killed  This Apprehension filled him with excessive Affliction and no longer able to stay in  Rome  which continually renewed in his Mind the Remembrance of his lost Son he returned to  Esi  the Place of his Birth and satisfied with the Riches he possessed quitted Merchandizing entirely  In this City there dwelt a rich Merchant named  Gerard Lanzetti  whose Wife being lately dead and he through his Intimacy with  Ambrogio  having frequent Opportunities of seeing the charming  Nicuola  fell violently in Love with her his own advanced Age and the extream Youth of  Nicuola  did not prevent him from demanding her in Marriage of her Father assuring him at the same Time that he would take her without any Portion  Ambrogio  had too much Understanding not to be sensible that so unequal a Match could be productive of no good Consequences yet to avoid offending the old Lover he would not give him an absolute Denial but put him off by saying he had still Hopes of recovering his Son and could not think of parting with  Nicuola  till he heard some News of her Brother  In the mean Time the Fame of  Nicuola  's extraordinary Beauty spread through the whole  City of  Esi  her Charms was the Subject of general Conversation When she went abroad the People gathered in Crouds to gaze on her and the noblest Youths in the City were continually passing before her Windows in Hopes of gaining a momentary Sight of her  But he who was most assiduous in watching for Opportunities to see her was a young Gentleman named  Lattantio Puccini  lately come to the Possession of an immense Fortune by the Death of his Father and Mother  The diligent Attendance of this Youth before her Windows at last attracted the Observation of  Nicuola  who being charmed with the Gracefulness of his Person and flattered by his constant Assiduities shewed herself frequently at her Window and with bewitching Smiles and encouraging Glances endeavoured to assure him that she was pleased with his Passion which  Lattantio  perceiving thought himself the happiest Lover in the World  Nicuola  who found an irresistible Sweetness in those new Desires that had taken Possession of her young Bosom opened her whole Soul to the insinuating Passion which grew at last to such a Height that Life was insupportable to her unless she saw him every Day  Lattantio  no longer able to content himself with beholding his beautiful Mistress at a Distance only was endeavouring to procure the Means of speaking to her in private when some urgent Affairs calling  Ambrogio  to  Rome  where he proposed to stay several Months he  was unwilling to leave  Nicuola  to the Care of Servants and therefore took her to  Fabriano  and left her with a Brother of his who had a Wife and Family  Nicuola  's Departure from  Esi  was so sudden and unexpected that she had no Time to inform her Lover of it so that he hearing her Father was gone to  Rome  supposed he had taken her with him and remained for some Time extremely disconsolate  Absence however producing its usual Effects so weakened the Idea of  Nicuola  in his Mind that an accidental Sight of the fair  Catella  Daughter to  Gerard Lanzetti  entirely erazed the Remembrance of  Nicuola  and he resigned himself wholly up to the Influence of this new Charmer  Nicuola  on the contrary grieved beyond Measure at not having been able to inform her Lover of the Place to which she was hurried passed her Time in Sighs Tears and Complaints  The rigid Austerity of her Uncle who kept her always in his Sight made it impossible for her to fend a Letter or Message to  Lattantio  so that this Restraint adding a fretful Impatience to her Grief she thought every Hour of Absence a thousand Years and wearied out by continual Anxiety and restless Wishes she fell into a deep and settled Melancholly which not all the tender Consolations of her Cousins who thought it was occasioned by the Absence of her Father could remove  In this Manner she languished several Months at the End of which her Father left  Rome  and passing by  Fabriano  called for his Daughter and returned to  Esi  Nicuola  left  Fabriano  with as much Joy as a Soul long tortured in  Purgatory  feels at quitting it for  Paradise  feeding her Imagination with the Transports her Return would give her ravished Lover and enjoying by Anticipation the exquisite Pleasure of an Interview after so tedious an Absence  But on her Arrival at  Esi  these pleasing Expectations were all changed to the most racking Jealousy Report informed her that  Lattantio  was fallen in Love with  Catella  and this cruel News was confirmed by his shocking Indifference towards herself for he took no more Notice of her than if he had never seen her before  Nicuola  now abandoned herself entirely to Despair the Infidelity of  Lattantio  was ten Times more insupportable than his Absence had been and so low was the unhappy Beauty reduced as to endeavour by repeated Letters and Messages to recall herself to his Remembrance but those proving all ineffectual she resolved to die unless by some Means yet untried she could recover the Heart of her ungrateful  Lattantio  While  Nicuola  was thus consuming with an almost hopeless Passion  Ambrogio  found it necessary to take another Journey to  Rome  and as his Daughter was unwilling to go a second Time to her Uncle's at  Fabriano  he  placed her till his Return in a Monastery where one of her Cousins named Sister  Cammilla Bissa  was professed  This Convent was formely in great Reputation for Sanctity but  Nicuola  had been there but a short Time before the disorderly Behaviour of the Nuns gave her great Disgust Their Conversation instead of turning upon the holy Lives of the Fathers their Piety their Abstinence and good Works were intemperate loose and profane Love was the Business of their Lives they were not ashamed to discover their Intrigues to each other but would even boast of their scandalous Appointments Instead of Fasting and Prayer they indulged themselves in the most delicate Repasts and slothful Ease Instead of wearing Shifts made of Hareskin next their Bodies they wore Linen of the highest Prices adorning themselves with the richest Silks and most expensive Ornaments heightening their native Beauty with all the Embellishments of Art and not scrupling even to make Use of Paints Washes and Essences to supply the Defects of Nature  Thus adorned and practising all the alluring Artifices of loose Curtezans they wasted whole Days in Discourses with the young Rakes of the City who spent the greatest Part of their Time at the Grate of their Convent  Nicuola  extremely scandalized at the indecent Behaviour of the Nuns often regretted her being placed in their Monastery and finding no Alleviation of her Griefs amongst  such disagreeable Companions she gave herself up to her secret Discontent  It happened one Day when Sister  Camilla  was with her that some body told that Nun  Lattantio  who often came there on account of Linens and fine Works which he employed those Nuns to make wanted her at the Grate  Camilla  went immediately without taking Notice of  Nicoula  's Disorder who no sooner heard the Sound of that Name than her fair Face and Bosom was all overspread with a glowing Red which in a Moment changed to an ashy Paleness and though her trembling Limbs were scarce able to support her yet impelled by an eager Desire to see again that much loved Face and hear the dear Sound of his Voice she crept to a little Place where unseen herself she might both hear and see her faithless Lover  This Practice she continued as often as she had any Opportunity and one Time when she was thus employed she heard  Lattantio  complain to  Camilla  of his ill Fortune in losing a Page who had served him three Years with the utmost Exactness and Fidelity The Youth he told her was just then dead of a Fever in his House which gave him great Concern because he despaired of ever getting another as faithful and affectionate as he had been  When he was gone  Nicoula  reflecting upon this Incident it came into her Head to disguise herself like a Boy and serve her Lover  in the quality of a Page but not knowing how to procure a Habit necessary for her Design she remained for some Time in more Discontent than ever  At length she took a Resolution to acquaint her Nurse with this new Scheme which Love had inspired and if possible engage her Assistance in executing it  Phillippa  for that was the Name of her Nurse loved  Nicuola  with as much Tenderness as if she had been her own Child and being desired by  Ambrogio  when he left  Esi  to see his Daughter very often and to take her when she had an Inclination to her own House she never failed to visit her at the Convent every Day and the Nuns with whom  Ambrogio  had left Directions for that Purpose permitted  Nicuola  to go out with her whenever she desired it  To this good Woman  Nicuola  had entrusted the Secret of her Passion for  Lattantio  and flattering herself that her Tenderness for her would make it easy to engage her Assistance in a Scheme that her whole Soul was now bent upon accomplishing she sent for her one Day and disclosing her Design earnestly conjured her to afford her the Means of executing it  Phillippa  after having for a long Time in vain endeavoured to dissuade her from an Attempt so dangerous to her Reputation at last consented to her Desire and taking her to her own House furnished her with a Suit of  Cloaths which had belonged to her own Son a Boy about  Nicuola  's Age who died a few Months before and thus equipt she went to the Street where her Lover lived  Chance assisting her Design brought  Lattantio  to the Door of his House just as  Nicuolo  entered the Street which she observing assumed the Air and Manner of a poor Stranger just arrived gazing at every Thing she saw and wandering backwards and forwards as if at a Loss what Place to go to  Lattantio  struck with the Appearance of so genteel and pretty a Youth stood still for some Moments observing him and supposing the poor Boy might possibly want a Service he made a Sign to him as he passed by to approach  Nicuola  accordingly came forward and  Lattantio  being still more pleased with him on a nearer View asked him his Name and whether he was born in  Esi  "My Lord replied  Nicuola  my Name is  Romulo  I was born in  Rome  and lost my Father when the City was taken my Mother died many Years before I attended a Nobleman as his Page who was mortally wounded when the City was sacked and because I wept and lamented his Misfortune two  Spanish  Soldiers beat me cruelly and left me in a miserable Condition"  "If thou art willing to serve me said  Lattantio  I will take thee to be my Page and treat thee in such a Manner that thou shalt have no Cause to complain of thy Condition"  "My Lord replied  Romulo  I accept your Offer with great Willingness and desire no other Recompence for my Services than what you shall judge they deserve  Romulo  accordingly entered that Day into his new Employment in which he acquitted himself with so much Diligence and Politeness that in a few Days he entirely gained the Favour of his Master who no longer regretted the Loss of his former Page but thought himself the happiest Man in the World in the Attendance of so genteel and so faithful a Servant  Romulo  was now clad in an elegant Livery and finding his Services agreeable to his Master and blest with his Sight and Conversation every Day he would not have changed his Condition for a Place in Paradise  It has been said before that  Lattantio  was enamoured of  Catella  the Daughter of  Gerard Lanzetti Nievola  's old Lover  This young Lady observing  Lattantio  passing every Day before her Windows and by his Looks and Actions endeavouring to shew the Violence of his Passion for her always looked upon him with great Complacency though her Heart was as yet wholly insensible of the soft Power of Love so that  Lattantio  endeavoured in vain by repeated Letters and Messages to prevail upon her to take some Resolution in his Favour  The artful Fairone though she was not disposed to return his Love yet being pleased  with his Assiduities would not entirely deprive him of Hope but while she carefully avoided coming to any Explanation with him by her encouraging Looks and Smiles she kept his Hopes alive and encreased his Desire  The extream Avarice of her Father notwithstanding his great Riches was the Cause that  Catella  had all the Opportunities she could wish to indulge her coquet Disposition for  Gerard  kept only three Domestics in his House  One of these was an old Woman who hardly ever stirred from the Fireside another a Lackey who always went abroad with him the third a young Maidservant who being bribed by  Lattantio  left the young Lady the Liberty of showing herself at the Window as much as she pleased and every Day brought her a Letter or Message from  Lattantio  The unhappy Lover finding all his Sollicitations hitherto fruitless conceived a Design of sending  Romulo  to intercede for him hoping from a Form and Youth so engaging and an Address so insinuating to induce her to make some Return to his ardent Passion  Accordingly giving his Page the necessary Instructions he ordered him immediately to go to the House of  Catella  Poor  Romulo  received this Commission with a breaking Heart and hastily quitting his Master's Presence ran to his good old Nurse to acquaint her with this new Misfortune  Oh Mother cried he throwing himself on her Neck all drowned in Tears I am reduced to the last Distress Fortune not contented with the Misery I indure in being Witness to the continual Sighs of my perjured  Lattantio  for  Catella  has ordered it so that I tortured as I am with Love and Jealousy must sollicit this happy Rival to yield to the Addresses of my Lover was there ever my dear Mother a Destiny so cruel as mine If this hated Embassy should be curst with Success if I should indeed be so wretched to gain my Rival for  Lattantio  there will be no other Remedy for my Woes but Death for it is impossible I should endure Life and behold my  Lattantio  in the Arms of another  Advise me assist me my dear Mother in this deplorable Extremity Alas I hoped by my Fidelity and Services to have made myself so dear to  Lattantio  that when I discovered myself to him the Greatness of my Love would induce him to take Compassion on me and restore me to the Possession of that Heart that was mine before it was  Catella  's but how have I deceived myself he thinks he talks of nothing else but  Catella  perjured Man she only is the Object of his Wishes and I am utterly abandoned Unhappy me what shall I do when my Father comes home if he should discover what I have done will he not kill me with his own Hands certainly he will for what can I say in Excuse for myself Help me oh help me my dear Mother tell me what I shall do to avoid the Misery with which I am threatened  Phillippa  was so moved with the Tears and Complaints of this her dear foster Child that for some Time she could do nothing but weep Recovering herself at last you ask my Advice my dear Daughter said she alas how often have I given it you in vain when in discoursing to me of your unhappy Love I foresaw and would have prevented the fatal Consequence of it  Now then I beseech you pay more regard to my Council resume your own Dress and either remain with me or go back to the Monastery and I will take care your Adventure shall never be known to your Father 'tis possible he may return soon to  Esi  and I would not for all the Wealth in the World he should discover you in this Dress the Consequence would be fatal to both you and me  Quit then this dangerous Scheme my dear  Nicuola  you see  Lattantio  is every Day more enamoured of  Catella  and you labour in vain to recal his Affection Why will you hazard your Life and Honour in so hopeless an Enterprize All the Reward you can expect for this unworthy Servitude is eternal Infamy both to yourself and Family Nor is this all your Father may perhaps sacrifice your Life to the Honour of your House which he will think you have disgraced how mean how unworthy is it for one of your Sex your Birth and Education to persist in loving one who despises you to follow one who flies from you Ah when I was of your Age I was never guilty of such Weakness I  was pursued I did not pursue I scorned others but was not scorned myself Collect your scattered Reason my dear Daughter quit all Thoughts of this ungrateful Man and place them on one more worthy your Affection  There are many noble Youths in this City who would esteem it a Happiness to gain you for a Wife but if your Adventure should be discovered depend upon it you would find it very difficult to get a Husband how are you sure  Lattantio  has not already discovered you and in Contempt of your Weakness means to take some Opportunity of making you subservient to his looser Pleasures Oh my  Nicuola  beware in Time stay here with me and shun all the Dangers which threaten your Innocence your Reputation and your Life"  Nicuola  listened attentively to her Nurse's Discourse and when she had ended it stood for some Moments fixed in Thought then sighing deeply "My dear Mother said she I acknowledge that your Advice is just and reasonable but alas I am incapable of following it since I have done so much I will see the End happen what will  I will go to  Catella  and perform my Commission and see whether I am able to prevail with her  Lattantio  has yet had only general Answers from her perhaps she may refuse him God who knows my Heart knows that I only desire to possess  Lattantio  with Honour Providence perhaps will at length favour my blameless Passion In the mean time I will call here every Day and acquaint  you with every thing that happens to me and if my Father should come home suddenly we must provide in the best Manner we can for the Honour of our House it is perhaps as great a Degree of Folly to anticipate Evil by Apprehensions as to indulge one's Self in a blind Security"  Romulo  then embracing the good old Woman who silently grieved at the Obstinacy she could not cure went away and arrived at  Catella  's House just as her Father attended by his Lackey went out  Catella  's Maid being at the Door he informed her that he was sent by  Lattantio  with a Message to her Lady and desired her to procure him Admittance to her  The Girl shewing him into a ground Parlour ran up stairs to her Mistress and out of Breath with Joy cried "Oh Madam  Lattantio  has sent his beautiful Page whom you have so often admired to speak to you"  Where is he interrupted  Catella  impatiently and being told by the Maid that she had ventured to bring him into the House and that he was waiting for her in the Parlour  Catella  with eager Haste flew to him and entering the Room was so astonished with a nearer View of that miraculous Beauty which had charmed her at a Distance that for some Moments she doubted if she was not in the Presence of an Angel  Romulo  making her a low Reverence delivered the Message his Master had sent  Catella  heard him with an inconceivable Delight not because the Purport of his Words pleased her but the Sound of that enchanting Voice conveyed an unusual Transport to her Heart lost in silent Admiration she stood contemplating the lovely Form before her while her soft Bosom heaved with till then unknown Desires then breathing an ardent Sigh and darting a Glance at him which better than the most expressive Words explained the tender Passion which had taken a full and absolute Possession of her Soul "Why Oh lovely and too dangerous Youth said she why do you hazard thus your Life by coming to me on such a Business Alas if my Father should return and find you here the Consequence would be fatal both to you and me"  Romulo  who had well observed her passionate Looks the Changes of her Colour and the interrupting Sighs that made her Words almost unintelligible was persuaded she had entertained a Passion for him and pleased beyond Measure at this happy Accident he assumed more Earnestness in his Looks and Voice  "It is fit Madam said he that a Servant should in all Things obey the Will of his Master and dangerous as this Embassy is yet I undertook it willingly at his Command who has a Right to all my Obedience send me not away then I conjure you Madam without a favourable Answer but have  Compassion on my Master who loves you with the most ardent Passion imaginable"  Catella  suffered him a long Time to solicit her in this Manner without making him any Answer when at last seeing him about to leave her and vanquished by the irresistible Force of her Passion "Oh Heavens cried she in a languishing Voice what you desire of me charming Youth I cannot grant you yourself make it impossible Alas by what Enchantment have you thus robbed me of myself"  You divert yourself Madam at my Expence replied  Romulo  I am no Enchanter and have practised no Arts upon you all I want is to prevail upon you to let me carry my Master some agreeable News who cannot live if you continue thus inexorable speak Madam will you allow me to give him Hopes that you will relent"  Catella  continuing silent  Romulo  bowing with a discontented Air moved towards the Door when she rouzed by that Action and no longer able to restrain herself hastily snatched his Hand and lifting up her fine Eyes to Heaven "Oh cried she in a faultering Voice to what am I reduced" then fixing them with a passionate Look on his Face "No Man in the World but you said she could have made me thus forget what I owe to myself I love you charming Youth I cannot live unless you return my Passion leave a Servitude so unworthy of you and be the Lord of me and all I have I ask not to know your Birth or Fortune mine can supply the Disadvantages of both all I require of you is  to quit the Service of  Lattantio  whom I can never love and from this Moment will never give a favourable Glance to and devote yourself entirely to me"  Romulo  finding the Business would go on as he wished after some further Discourse with  Catella  promised her to be wholly guided by her Will assuring her he would always most gratefully acknowledge the Honour and Happiness to which she raised him but at the same Time earnestly entreated her to act with all imaginable Caution in the Affair between them to prevent its coming to the Knowledge of  Lattantio  who if he discovers my good Fortune added he will not fail to sacrifice me to his Revenge  Catella  promising to follow his Advice implicitly  Romulo  kissed her Hand with a respectful Tenderness assuring her he would see her very soon again and then went home where he found his Master waiting for him with an anxious Impatience  Romulo  then told him "that he was obliged to wait a long Time before he could procure Admittance to  Catella  whom he found highly incensed against him as well on Account of the severe chiding she had just then suffered from her Father for encouraging his Love as because she had been informed that he had formerly loved a young Lady of that City very passionately I used my utmost Endevaours added  Romulo  to remove this Suspicion from her Mind but all in vain and she  dismissed me with an Assurance that she would never see you more"  Lattantio  was extremely afflicted at this sad News he made his Page repeat several times all the Arguments he had used to  Catella  in his Favour and afterwards entreated him to take another Opportunity of speaking to her on the same Subject  Romulo  promised to do all that lay in his Power for him The next Day the discontented  Lattantio  passing through the Street where his Mistress lived in hopes of seeing her  Catella  who was at her Window no sooner espied him standing opposite to it than darting a dreadful Frown at him she hastily withdrew leaving him overwhelmed with Grief at this Confirmation of his Misfortune  The unhappy Lover returned to his House and shutting himself up in his Chamber with  Romulo  began to lament his unfortunate Destiny and being greatly mortified at the contemptuous Treatment he received from  Catella  he broke into Invectives and Reproaches against her  Romulo  seeing his Master moved as he desired began to reason on the fantastic Effects of Love and pursuing his Discourse "How often does it happen said he that a Man becomes violently enamoured with a Lady who repays his Passion with Indifference and Disdain and while he consumes away in hopeless Wishes for her some unhappy Fairone languishes in Secret for him"  "Your Observation is very just returned  Lattantio  and the same Thing has happened to myself Some Months ago I was beloved by one of the most beautiful Virgins in this City who was lately come from  Rome  I perceived her Passion and I returned it with the most ardent Affection but she left the City and I could not discover to what Place she was gone  "In the mean time I happened to see this haughty Beauty whose Charms took so absolute Possession of my Heart that all Remembrance of the other was totally erased  "The Fairone I had abandoned returned to  Esi  and by Letters expostulated with me on my Infidelity and tenderly endeavoured to recal my Affection but I was so wholly engrossed by my Passion for the ungrateful  Catella  that I never took any Notice of her repeated Complaints"  "Ah my Lord replied  Romulo  Love has well revenged your Injuries to Love  Catella  by her Disdain of you repays without designing it your Infidelity to one who gave you her Heart without Reserve and it is possible the unhappy Maid you have abandoned wastes her Days in fruitless Wishes and loves you still though hopeless of ever being beloved again"  "I know not that said  Lattantio  but it is certain I did once love her with a most ardent Affection for she was beautiful as an Angel and  Catella  ah how Cruelty has altered her  Catella  compared to her is all Deformity to say the Truth added  Lattantio  looking fixedly  on  Romulo  thy Face has so strong a Resemblance of the charming  Nicuola  's that if thou wert dressed like a Woman I should swear thou wert she herself thy Age and her's I believe are little different but I think she is something taller than thee But why do I thus trifle Let us speak again of that fair Devil whom in spite of myself I cannot banish from my Thoughts Tell me  Romulo  hast thou Courage enough to solicit her once more on my Account"  "I will do all I can for you replied  Romulo  and though I was sure of perishing in the Attempt I would return to her again and plead for you"  But here we must quit for a while the unfaithful Lover and his disguised Mistress to relate what happened to  Paolo  the lost Brother of  Nicuola  His Master the  German  having turned all the rich Moveables he had got at the sacking of  Rome  into Money prepared to leave  Naples  and return to his own Country when he was suddenly seized with a violent Fever of which he died in a few Days having by his Will left  Paolo  Heir of all his Wealth  The fortunate  Paolo  now free and in Possession of a large Fortune having caused his Patron to be honourably interred took Post for  Rome  and there enquiring for his Father was told he was gone to  Esi  whither he also went  But instead of going directly to his Father's House he alighted at an Inn and leaving his  Baggage to the Care of his Servants and his Host he went out alone and took his Way to the Street where his Father lived happening to pass by the House of  Gerardo Lanzetti Catella  being as usual at her Window spied him and supposing him to be  Romulo  was greatly surprized at his walking on without taking any Notice of her  Her Father not being at home she ordered her Maid to run after him and tell him she desired to speak with him The Girl did as she was directed and overtaking  Paolo  "Sir said she come back immediately my Lady expects you"  Paolo  by his Request and the Girl's familiar Manner of accosting him supposed he was mistaken for another Person and resolved within himself to see who this Lady was and beginning to suspect that she was some Curtezan "I will see the End of this Adventure thought he and try my Fortune but the Lady will be deceived if she thinks to get much Money from me I will give her but half a Crown at the most"  At the same Moment that  Paolo  conducted by the Maid arrived at the Door of the House  Gerardo  appeared at the Head of the Street The Girl seeing him turned hastily to  Paolo  "Oh Sir said she there is my Master yonder walk hereabout he will not stay long when he goes out again I will come and let you know"  Paolo  accordingly went away having first taken good Notice of the House that he might know it again  The Girl as soon as he was gone ran in and shut the Door without being perceived by  Gerardo  who walking leisurely as old Men do gave her Time enough and arriving at his House knocked at the Door and was let in by the Girl highly pleased that he had not discovered her  Paolo  who staid at a little Distance to observe the old Man had a Glimpse of  Catella  who was standing at a Window and was charmed to a Degree of Rapture with her Beauty  His Thoughts being now wholly engrossed by this fair Unknown he walked pensively on to his Father's House end seeing the Windows shut he enquired of a Shopkeeper where  Ambrogio Nanni  lived who told him he had not been seen  Esi  for several Months past  Paolo  then returned to his Inn languishing with an eager Desire to see again the Fairone that had charmed him But doubting lest there might be some Danger in the Adventure he resolved to take one of his Servants with him when he went to see her again  In the mean time  Ambrogio  returned as has been related and  Gerardo  going out of his House met him and after he had welcomed him to  Esi  added  "Ambrogio  you are come in good Time for I am weary of Delays and am determined to know at once whether you will give me your Daughter or no"  You see answered  Ambrogio  that I am but just arrived we shall have Leisure enough  to talk of this Affair when I have a little recovered the Fatigue of my Journey"  While the two old Men were talking in this Manner  Ambrogio  on Horseback  Gerardo  on foot  Romulo  who was going to  Catella  entered the Street and seeing her Father returned ran away terrified almost out of her Senses and went to her Nurse's House  "Oh my dear Mamma said she out of Breath with Fear and Haste my Father is come back what shall I do"  "I will go to him repied  Philippa  and in the mean Time do you put on your own Cloaths and do not stir from hence till my Return"  Nicuola  now no longer  Romulo  having resumed her own Dress  Philippa  went to  Ambrogio  who had just dismounted and was entering his House  The old Woman saluted him with a chearful Countenance expressing great Joy at his safe Return  Ambrogio  having thanked her enquired for his Daughter  "I saw her this very Morning said the good Nurse and staid a great while with her in the Convent How the dear Child will be transported to hear of your Arrival I had Her frequently at my House during your Absence sometimes she has staid with me four or five Days together Truly she is a fine Girl and works admirably well with her Needle With your leave Sir added she I will go to the Convent and inform her of your Return and carry her to my House where she may stay a  few Days till your's is put in order to receive her"  Ambrogio  consenting the old Woman took her Leave but before▪ she went home she called at the Convent to settle Matters with sister  Camilla  who being a perfect Mistress of Intrigue she assured  Philippa  that  Nicuola  's Absence from the Convent should do her no Hurt for she would punctually follow all her Directions  Philippa  very well satisfied with her Success returned home where  Nicuola  impatiently expected her she desired her to compose herself for all was now safe and then related distinctly all that had passed and told her she was at Liberty to go home the next Day to her Father or to stay with her for some Days  Nicuola  chose the latter and being now freed from her tormenting Apprehensions of being discovered to her Father she gave a Loose to her Grief on  Lattantio  's Account her Passion seemed to gather new Fire from the Difficulties which opposed it and she resolved to accomplish her Desires or die  Philippa  combated these Thoughts with all the Reason she was Mistress of drawing Arguments from her despair to induce her to forget  Lattantio  "You may be now convinced said she that  Lattantio  loves  Catella  with inexpressible Ardour and will never think of any other Woman and in a short Time no Doubt will ask her of her Father in Marriage"  "Ah this is what I dread replied  Nicuola  weeping Oh spiteful Fortune my Father's sudden Return has broke all my Design I had conceived Hopes and with Reason too of putting  Lattantio  into such Disgrace with  Catella  that she would sooner consent to marry a Moor than him but my Father's unlucky Return has ruined me"  "Ruined you interrupted  Philippa  say rather that his Return has preserved you from Ruin if it be true what you have told me concerning  Catella  's Fondness for you I foresee nothing but Shame and Misery can attend the Prosecution of your Designs Had you gone back to her again the shameless Wanton would by some Means or other have certainly discovered your Sex and the Consequence would be eternal Infamy to you since being persuaded herself you was the Strumpet of  Lattantio  she would persuade the World to believe you so too"  "That she should believe me the Mistress of  Lattantio  replied  Nicuola  is what my Wishes aimed at yet this could not have hurt my Character for though she discovered my Sex she had no Opportunity of knowing my Name and Family and  Lattantio  would have appeared so treacherous and ungrateful to her that she would never again have endured him in her Sight"  Philippa  could not be convinced by his false Reasoning of  Nicuola  's "Set your Heart at Rest my Child said she for no human Arts can change the Decrees of Providence  If it be the Will of God that  Catella  should be the Wife of  Lattantio  all your Artifices to prevent this Union will be fruitless Quit this hopeless Enterprize then and attend to your real Happiness you are young beautiful and rich your Brother  Paolo  poor Youth is certainly dead or else in all this Time we should have had some Accounts of him by his Death God rest his Soul if you behave well you will inherit your Father's whole Estate with this blooming Youth this beautiful Person and these great Riches do you imagine you can want the Addresses of many noble Youths among whom you may fix upon one more lovely than  Lattantio  "  While  Philippa  and  Nicuola  wasted the Time in these Kinds of Discourses  Paolo  employed his in walking before the Windows of  Catella  in Hopes of seeing her again and  Lattantio  who staid at home impatiently expecting the Return of his Page saw the Night approaching with great Surprize not knowing to what Cause he should attribute his long Stay  He passed the whole Night in the most tormenting Suspence fearing some Misfortune had happened to the Youth whom he tenderly loved on Account of his Fidelity the Sweetness of his Manners and the exact Attention with which he waited on him Nor was  Catella  free from a restless Inquietude she loved  Romulo  with extreme Ardour and wished for nothing so much as to be united to him for ever  Nicuola  whose ardent Passion rendered her incapable of tasting the soft Blessings of Sleep spent the Night in sighing and talking of  Lattantio  to her Nurse whom she would not suffer to take any more Repose than herself  The Morning now approached and  Lattantio  not seeing  Romulo  appear rose in great Agitation of Mind and went about the Town seeking him and enquiring of every one whom he thought could give him any Intelligence of him  While he was thus employed a Shopkeeper who had listened to the Description he gave of the Person and Dress of his lost Page informed him that he saw such a Youth go into the House of an old Woman named  Philippa  who lived near the great Church  Lattantio  thanking the Man for his Information accepted his Offer of shewing him the House and knocking at the Door  Philippa  opened a Window and asked him what he wanted "Good Woman said  Lattantio  with your Leave I should be glad to speak ten Words to you" "Oh a hundred replied  Philippa  who knew him and was almost out of her Wits with Surprize and Joy then closing the Window she told  Nicuola  who was below and ran down hastily to let him in  Lattantio  entering the House was seated by the good Woman in a Place where  Nicuola  could hear and see all that passed  Lattantio  then obliging  Philippa  to sit near him thus began "My good Woman it may appear  strange to you that I who have never don you any Favour or Kindness should come to demand both of you however I depend so much upon your good Sense and Benevolence for which you are in very high Esteem that I will freely require a Favour of you and doubt not but to be obliged by your Compliance Without more Ceremony then tell me I beseech you for what Cause a young Boy of a most beautiful Person drest in white with a gold Tassel on his Cap came and secreted himself yesterday in your House as I am informed You must know my good  Philippa  that this Boy is my Page for whom I have a great Affection which he deserves on Account of the Readiness and Fidelity with which he has always obeyed my Commands I sent him abroad yesterday on some particular Business and I have never seen him since and being told as I said before that he came here I am come to desire you will restore him to me again or tell me at least for what Cause he has left me"  "My Son replied the old Woman I thank you for your good Opinion of me and for having deigned to honour my poor Habitation with your Presence an Honour which indeed I have for some time ardently wished for having some particular Business to discourse with you upon and since you have been pleased to give me this Opportunity I will make Use of it But first as to the Question you asked me concerning your Page I do assure you I can give you no Account of him  there is no Boy in my House nor have I seen such an one as you describe any where hereabouts"  "You suspect perhaps interrupted  Lattantio  that I intend to chastise my Page for not returning home last Night but upon my Honour I have no such Design therefore do not conceal the Truth but tell me for what Reason he staid away"  "Upon the Faith of a Christian said  Philippa  neither Man or Boy was in this House yesterday and I am sorry I cannot answer your Demand I would do it very willingly if I was able"  Lattantio  here breathing a deep Sigh  Philippa  looked earnestly on him "These ardent Sighs said she and this restless Anxiety on Account of your Page might persuade any other Person that you loved him too well but I have often heard that you loved a very beautiful young Lady so that I cannot easily believe you to be an Enemy to Women"  "Would to Heaven replied  Lattantio  passionately that I did not love I should be the happiest Man in the World Yes my good  Philippa  you have been truly informed there is a young Lady in this City whom I love more than my own Soul" These Words he accompanied with a profound Sigh Tears at the same Time falling fast from his Eyes notwithstanding all his Endeavours to restrain them  Philippa  seeing him so softened thought she had now an Opportunity to speak more fully to him "I know well my Son said she in a soothing Accent that an unfortunate Lover is the most unhappy Being in the World no Grief is equal to that of loving without being beloved again this is your Case and my Soul melts with Compassion for you"  "How do you know this so certainly interrupted  Lattantio"  rouzed to Attention by her Words  "Enquire not how I came to know it replied she it is sufficient that I do know you love and are not beloved and some Months ago you loved a Lady more beautiful than your present Mistress who returned your Passion with equal Warmth now at this very Moment I am convinced she languishes and dies for you ungrateful as you are and you no longer preserve the least Remembrance of her"  "I know not that answered  Lattantio  though you may perhaps for methinks you are perfectly well acquainted with my Affairs tell me then I beseech you by what Means you know the Lady I love at present bestows her Affection on another"  "I do not think it necessary to answer that Question replied  Philippa  and you must pardon me if I tell you that you are justly punished by the Disdain of one Lady for your Infidelity and Ingratitude to the other and happy will it be for you if your Punishment stops here"  "Ah poor  Nicuola  added she raising her Voice lovely and unfortunate Maid what hast thou not done to recall the Affection of this unfaithful Man but all in vain while he insensible of thy Charms and unmoved by those Proofs of unalterable Affection which thou hast given him follows the haughty  Catella  with a rejected Love and meanly sues to one who hates and despises him"  The Youth lost in Amazement at hearing all these Particulars from one whom he thought had been an absolute Stranger to him gazed on her in Silence not knowing what to answer While  Nicuola  stood trembling in her Concealment her Heart beating with anxious Expectation Fear and Hope taking Possession of her Soul by Turns  Philippa  expecting  Lattantio  's Reply continued silent and he recovering a little from his Surprize and Confusion beholding her with an earnest Look thus spoke  "Since you are so well acquainted with my Affairs  Philippa  I will speak freely and at large to you"  "'Tis true I was once enamoured of  Nicuola Nanni  and I have some Reason to think she had also an Affection for me She left this City with her Father and I could never discover to what Place she went and in the mean Time I saw this fair Devil  Catella  the Daughter of  Gerardo Lanzetti  whom I have loved passionately ever since for some Time she received my Addresses favourably but within these few Days her Behaviour has been  wholly changed I sent my Page to her with a Message Yesterday but he never returned to bring me an Answer so I have at once lost all Hopes of gaining the Object of my Affections and am abandoned by a Servant for whom I had a great Esteem"  "Had he returned and informed me that she was resolved to persevere in her unjust Disdain I would have endeavoured to conquer my Passion and dispose myself to love one to whom my Services would be more acceptable for indeed I am convinced it is a great Degree of Madness to follow one who flies from me and to love a Woman who is resolved never to return my Passion"  "I am glad you are grown so reasonable my Son said the good Woman but pray answer me truly to one Question If  Nicuola  whom you once loved should continue still to love you in spite of your Infidelity with a most ardent Affection what would she deserve from you"  "Truly  Philippa  replied  Lattantio  in that Case she deserves that I should love her more than myself however it is impossible that she should continue to love me seeing that I have injured her so basely not only in abandoning her for a Person far less amiable than herself but in never returning any Answer to many Letters which she sent me so that I must appear to her the most ungrateful of Mankind"  "Notwithstanding all this replied  Philippa  she loves you still loves you with an unshaken  Constancy and often in Confidence has she declared to me that she not only did love you with as much Violence as ever but would continue to do so while she lived"  "Oh it cannot be interrupted  Lattantio  it is impossible why should you endeavour to deceive me"  "I do not deceive you replied  Philippa  I can give you convincing Proofs of what I say  Nicuola  loves you more than ever for you she forsook her Father's House for you she forgot the Delicacy of her Sex the Riches she was born to and the Rank she held in Life and submitted to do you all the Offices of a menial Servant Nay be not astonished pursued she for all this the lovely and too loving  Nicuola  did for you tell me then if I make it appear plainly that she has done this what does she deserve"  "You tell me Wonders replied  Lattantio  Things which surpass Belief yet if they are true without doubt  Nicuola  merits all my Love which I can shew no other Way than by being hers for ever"  Philippa  having brought him to the Point she desired rose up hastily and bid the trembling Maid who had heard all that passed dress herself immediately in her Boy's Cloaths which being done she led her into the Room where  Lattantio  was her Face all covered with Blushes and her fine Eyes bent on the Ground in a sweet Confusion  "Behold said  Philippa  presenting her to  Lattantio  behold your  Nicuola  behold your  Romulo  your so much desired Page this is she who despised the whole World for your Sake and with the utmost Hazard of her Life and Honour waited on you Night and Day"  Lattantio  lost in Astonishment at what he heard and saw continued silent and immovable in his Chair his Eyes fixed on the blushing Maid who not being able to meet his Looks hid her averted Face with one of her Hands while  Philippa  related her whole Story  "Is it possible cried  Lattantio  recovering from his Amazement can  Nicuola  have done so much for me Oh I should be the most ungrateful the most detestable of all human Beings if I could be insensible to such matchless Tenderness and Truth I will not waste Time in needless Excuses for my past Faults said he rising and approaching  Nicuola  but if it be true that you love and pardon me from this Moment I vow to be only your's and will make you my Wife whenever you please"  Nicuola  who now saw herself arrived to the Summit of all her Wishes could hardly contain the swelling Transport and turning her fine Eyes on  Lattantio  big with unutterable Joy and Love she held out her Hand to him which he received and kissed passionately  "My Lord said she receive my Faith which I now give you with an Assurance that your Will from henceforward shall be always mine and that the Name and Quality of  Wife shall not hinder me from continuing still to be the most obedient of your Servants"  Lattantio  then taking a Diamond from his own Finger put it on her's and in the Presence of  Philippa  solemnly contracted himself to her That done he desired her to change her Dress immediately and go home with  Philippa  to her Father's whither he intended shortly to follow them and demand her of  Ambrogio  for his Wife  In the mean Time  Paolo  full of a restless Inquietude left his Inn as soon as he had dined and returned to the Street where  Catella  lived and standing before her Windows he anxiously waited for another View of that sprightly Fairone whose Charms had already taken an absolute Possession of his Heart  Catella  who longed as impatiently to see again the lovely Page no sooner spied  Paolo  standing in the Street and gazing up at the Window than supposing him to be  Romulo  she hastily called her Maid "Yonder is  Romulo  said she waiting for Admittance go and let him in my Father is now abroad I can see him with Safety"  The Girl obeyed her Orders and  Catella  running down Stairs with eager Haste met  Paolo  as he entered and taking him with her into a Room "Oh  Romulo  Oh my Love said she how tedious has the Time appeared since I saw you last and Oh how long are you in taking Resolutions but I will not part with you now continued she throwing her Arms about his Neck and reclining her Face on his Shoulder with a languishing Sweetness  No my lovely Youth I will not part with you till you have told me whether I am to live or die for if you will not be mine certainly Life will be insupportable to me"  Live charming Maid said the transported  Paolo  pressing her to his Breast with inconceivable Ardour live and dispose of the Destiny of your  Romulo"  At this Moment  Gerardo  finding his Door open walked in softly and hearing a strange Voice in the Parlour he entered precipitately At the Sight of a Man with his Daughter he was going to give Vent to a Rage which might have had fatal Effects had it not been suddenly allayed by a Sight of  Paolo  's Face which was so like  Nicuola  's that he immediately concluded it was that fair Maid drest in the Habit of a Boy Possest with this Belief he approched the Lovers and taking  Paolo  by the Hand  "Nicuola  said he it is well thou art not what thou seem'st to be otherwise I should make both thee and  Catella  repent this Familiarity" then turning to his Daughter he bid her go up to her Chamber and leave  Nicuola  with him "for I added the old Man smiling am fitter Company for her than you"  Catella  obeyed and left the Room much wondering at her Father's Moderation and at his calling the Youth  Nicuola  but being well pleased that she had escaped so easily she resolved patiently to wait the Event  Paolo  on the other Hand was full of uneasy Confusion not knowing how the old  Man would behave to him seeing that he took him for his Sister  "My dear  Nicuola  said  Gerardo  why are you thus disguised How comes it that  Ambrogio  your Father suffers you to go about alone in this Manner Tell me the Truth what was the Cause of your coming hither Did you want to see what Sort of a House I keep and in what State I live I spoke to your Father two Days ago about giving you to me for a Wife and I have insisted upon knowing his Resolution soon I assure you you will be very happy in having me for a Husband you shall govern my House and command me in all Things Why art thou silent my  Nicuola  Speak and tell me thy Mind"  The old Man at the finishing these Words made an Offer of kissing the supposed  Nicuola  who pushing him away roughly said "Forbear this Freedom speak to my Father and suffer me to depart I came here by mere Accident and without any Design"  "I will let you go since you will have it so said  Gerardo  and will see your Father presently and finish this Affair"  Paolo  accordingly left him and went to his Father who had just given his Consent that  Lattantio  should marry his Daughter he having come there to demand her  Ambrogio  at the unexpected Sight of his longlost Son was ready to expire with Joy who after the first Caresses were over acquainted him with his good Fortune and the great Riches that had been bequeathed to  him The joyful Father seeing his Daughter so happily married and his Son return with so much Wealth thought himself the happiest Man in the World  In the midst of the mutual Congratulations of this happy Family  Gerardo  arrived and was so astonished at the Sight of  Paolo  and his Sister together that he doubted whether he was awake or asleep  Ambrogio  relieved him from his Perplexity by telling him of the unlookedfor Return of his Son informing him also that he had married  Nicuola  to  Lattantio  and then at  Paolo  's earnest Entreaty he desired him to give him his Daughter for a Wife  The old Man was at first much affected at the Loss of his intended Bride but seeing there was no Remedy he resolved to bear it patiently and consented that  Catella  should marry  Paolo  Both these Marriages were performed the same Day to the great Satisfaction of the four Lovers who lived ever after with the greatest Harmony imaginable  OBSERVATIONS  on the Use  Shakespear  has made of the foregoing Novel in his Comedy called  TwelfthNight  or  What You Will  The Fable of  TWELFTHNIGHT  or  WHAT YOU WILL  SEBASTIAN  and  Viola  his Sister Twins and so like each other in Person that in the same Cloaths they could not be distinguished embark in a Vessel upon what Account or with what Design we are not informed which is cast away upon the Coast of  Illyria  Viola  escapes drowning by the Assistance of the Captain and some of the Mariners and gets safe to Land but  Sebastian  her Brother is suspected to have perished  Viola  being informed that the Country where she now is is  Illyria  and that it is governed by a Duke named  Orsino  who is in Love but not beloved again by a noble Lady she expresses a Wish to be received into her Service  The Captain tells her the Lady is so afflicted for the Death of her Brother that she will admit of no Solicitations whatever not even the Duke's whereupon  Viola  without further Reflexion entreats the Captain to provide her with a Disguise and recommend her as an Eunuch to the Duke in whose Service she is very desirous to be placed  The Captain consents and  Viola  under the Name of  Caesario  soon gains the Duke's Favour and Confidence who sends him to the Countess  Olivia  the Lady he loves to solicit her Favour for him  Viola  is by this Time violently in love with the Duke yet she executes her Commission very faithfully and pleads strongly for her Master to the Lady the disconsolate and rigid  Olivia  is presently struck with the Beauty of the young Page and falls downright in Love with him  Viola  very honestly resists all her Offers but the Lady will not be repulsed she sends to entreat he will come to her again and her Messenger meeting  Sebastian  who had also escaped drowning but was ignorant of his Sister's Fate deceived by the Resemblance takes him for  Caesario  and entreats him to come to his Lady  Sebastian  though much surprized at the Adventure resolves to follow his Fortune he is introduced to  Olivia  who supposing him to be  Caesario  urges him to marry her to which  Sebastian  who is immediately charmed with her Beauty gladly consents  The Duke some Time after impatient to see  Olivia  comes to her House attended by  Caesario  Olivia  comes out to meet him and seeing  Caesario  supposing him to be the Person she had married reproaches him with Breach of Promise what that Promise is we are not told  The Duke complains of her Cruelty she takes little Notice of him directing her Looks and Words to  Caesario  last the Duke being provoked by her Declaration that she could not love him tells her he will revenge the Disdain she treats him with upon her Minion his Page whom he knows she loves  Caesario  professes his Willingness to die by his Commands and is following the Duke but stopped by  Olivia  who bids him remember their late Engagements and declares he is her Husband the Duke storms  Caesario  denies the Charge ahd the Priest is called in by  Olivia  to witness that he had married them which he does  Caesario  persisting in his Denial many Altercations ensue at last  Sebastian  who had been engaged in a Quarrel with  Olivia  's Uncle appears the Company are all astonished at the Resemblance between him and  Caesario  who is discovered to be  Viola  his Sister  Olivia  acknowledges  Sebastian  for her Husband and the Duke marries  Viola  The rest  is all Episode and makes up the greatest as well as the best Part of the Play  It has hitherto been uncertain whether the Story of  TwelfthNight  or  What You Will  was borrowed from any Novel or an Invention of  Shakespear  Mr  Langbaine  in his  Account of the Dramatic Poets and their Writing  says that he knows not from whence that Play was taken but the Resemblance of  Sebastian  to his Sister  Viola  was doubtless first borrowed not only by  Shakespear  but all our succeeding Poets from  Plautus  who has made Use of it in several Plays as  Amphitrio Maenechmi  c  It is really surprising to see the Admirers of  Shakespear  so solicitous to prove he was very conversant with the Antients they take all Opportunities to find in his Writings Illusions to them Imitations of their Thoughts and Expressions and will not scruple to allow their Favourite to have been guilty of some little Thefts from their Works provided it will make out his Claim to an Acquaintance with them  It is very much to be doubted whether or not he understood the  Italian  and  French  Languages since we find he made Use of Translations from both when he borrowed of their Authors and still less probable is it that he understood and studied the  Greek  and  Latin  Poets when he who was so close a Copyer has never imitated them in their chief Beauties  and seems wholly a Stranger to the Laws of dramatic Poetry well does the Poet say of him  Shakespear  Fancy's sweetest Child  Warbles his native WoodNotes wild  His true Praise seems to be summ'd up in those two Lines for wild though harmonious his Strains certainly are and his modern Admirers injure him greatly by supposing any of those WoodNotes copied from the Antients  Milton  by calling them  native  allows them to have been untaught and all his own and in that does Justice to his vast Imagination which is robbed of great Part of its Merit by supposing it to have received any Assistance from the Antients whom if he understood it must be confessed he has profited very little by since we see not the least Shadow of their Exactness and Regularity in his Works  Though it should be granted that  Shakespear  took the Hint of  Sebastian  and  Viola  's Resemblance from the  Maenechmi  and  Amphitrio  of  Plautus  yet he might have done that without understanding  Latin  since there were Translations of both those Plays in his Time and to his own Invention had that been the Case might be attributed almost all the perplexing Adventures which the Resemblance of the Brother and Sister gave rise to in the  TwelfthNight  and which are very different from those in the  Latin  Author  But  Shakespear  had a much more ample Supply for the Fable of this Comedy in the foregoing Novel from whence he undoubtedly drew it and which not only furnished him with the Hint of the Resemblance between  Sebastian  and  Viola  but also with the greatest Part of the Intrigue of the Play  Sebastian  and  Viola  in the Play are the same with  Paolo  and  Nicuola  in the Novel both are Twins and both remarkably like each other  Viola  is parted from her Brother by a Shipwreck and supposes him to be drowned  Nicuola  loses her Brother at the sacking of  Rome  and for a long Time is ignorant whether he is alive or dead  Viola  serves the Duke with whom she is in love in the Habit of a Page  Nicuola  in the same Disguise attends  Lattantio  who had forsaken her for  Catella  The Duke sends  Viola  to solicit his Mistress in his Favour  Lattantio  commissions  Nicuola  to plead for him with  Catella  The Duke's Mistress falls in love with  Viola  supposing her to be a Man and  Catella  by the like Mistake is enamoured of  Nicuola  and lastly the two Ladies in the Play as well as in the Novel marry their Lovers whom they had waited on in Disguise and their Brothers  wed the Ladies who had been enamoured of them  Though  Shakspear  has copied the Novelist in all these Particulars yet he differs from him in others which very much lessens the Probability of the Story  Sebastian  and  Viola  in the Play are parted by a Shipwreck and  Viola  is cast upon the Coast of  Illyria  but we are not told with what Intention this Brother and Sister embarked or whither their Voyage was bound  The Poet had Occasion for them in  Illyria  and there they are at the Service of the Audience no Matter if introduced with Propriety or not we must be contented to take them as we find them Well  Viola  after giving some Tears to the Memory of her Brother whom she fears is drowned is desirous of being recommended as an Attendant to a Lady with whom the Sovereign of the Country is in love but being told it would be difficult to procure Admission to her she all of a sudden takes up an unaccountable Resolution to serve the young BatchelorDuke in the Habit of a Man take it in her own Words addressed to the Captain of the wreck'd Vessel  Conceal me what I am and be my Aid  For such Disguise as haply shall become  The Form of my Intent I'll serve this Duke  Thou shalt present me as an Eunuch to him  It may be worth thy Pains for I can sing  And speak to him in many Sorts of Music  That will allow me very worth his Service  A very natural Scheme this for a beautiful and virtuous young Lady to throw off all at once the Modesty and Reservedness of her Sex mix among Men herself disguised like one and prest by no Necessity influenced by no Passion expose herself to all the dangerous Consequences of so unworthy and shameful a Situation  We find this Incident managed with much more Decency in the Novel  Nicuola  is violently in love with and beloved by  Lattantio  and finding that during a short Absence from him he became enamoured of  Catella  upon hearing he had lost his Page and wanted another she disguises herself like a Boy and offers her Service to wait upon him with a View of recalling his Affections by this extraordinary Instance of her Tenderness and Fidelity and of seizing every Opportunity of traversing his new Passion for  Catella  This Project though not altogether prudent and wise was far from being inconsistent with the Temper and Circumstances of  Nicuola  stimulated as she was by Love Jealousy and Despair to attempt something extraordinary for the Recovery of her Lover  But what are  Viola  's Motives for so rash an Enterprize She is neither in love with or abandoned by the Duke and cannot reasonably propose to herself any Advantage by thus hazarding her Virtue and Fame His Person she had never seen his Affections she was informed  were engaged what then were her Views and Designs by submitting to be his Attendant  Bandello  does not even make  Nicuola  resolve upon such an Expedient till the Design was suggested to her by overhearing  Lattantio  lament the Loss of his Page and wish for another  But the Novellist is much more careful to preserve Probability in his Narration than the Poet in his Action The Wonder is that  Shakespear  should borrow so many Incidents from him and yet task his Invention to make those Incidents unnatural and absurd  The Passion of  Olivia  the Duke's Mistress for the disguised Lady is attended with Circumstances that make it appear highly improbable and ridiculous She is represented as a noble and virtuous Lady overwhelmed with Grief for the Death of a beloved Brother her Grief indeed is of a very extraordinary Nature and inspired her with strange Resolutions according to the Report of  Valentine  the Duke's Servant who had been sent by him with a Message to her  Duke  How now what News from her  Val  So please my Lord I might not be admitted  But from her Handmaid do return this Answer  The Element itself till seven Years hence  Shall not behold her Face at ample View  But like a Cloystress she will veiled walk  And water once a Day her Chamber round  With eyeoffending Brine All this to season  A Brother's dead Love which she would keep fresh  And lasting in her sad Remembrance  This sorrowful Lady however makes her first Appearance in the Company of a Jester with whom she is extremely diverted and notwithstanding her Vow which we are told of in another Place hot to admit the Sight or Company of Men she permits the Duke's Page to approach her shews him her Face and bandies Jests and smart Sentences with all the lively Wit of an airy Coquet  Then follows her sudden Passion for the supposed Youth which is as suddenly declared without any of those Emotions that Bashfulness Delicacy and a Desire of preserving the Decorum her Sex and Birth oblige her to observe must raise in the Mind of a Woman of Honour  Had  Shakespear  by mixing so much Levity in the Character of  Olivia  designed a Satire on the Sex he would have certainly led us by some Reflexions on the Inconsistency of her Behaviour to have made that Inference but this is not the Case for  Olivia  is every where highly extolled for her Virtues  It is his injudicious Conduct of the Fable that gives so much Impropriety to the Manners of his Persons at least in this Instance  which is the more surprizing as the Novel furnished him with one much better contrived and Characters more suitable to the Action  Catella  acts the same Part in the Novel that  Olivia  does in the Play but  Catella  is a young gay libertine Girl whose Birth was but mean and Education neglected it was not therefore surprizing that she should so easily fall in Love with a Page indecently court him and resolve to marry him such an inconsiderate Conduct was agreeable to her Character but in the noble and virtuous  Olivia  'tis unnatural and absurd and what makes it still more so is that as  Shakespear  has ordered the Matter  Olivia  is disgracefully repulsed by this Youth and yet continues her Suit whereas  Cattella  meets with a ready Compliance from the supposed  Romulo  who sees his Designs on  Lattantio  likely to succeed by his Mistress's fortunate Passion for him  Olivia  's taking  Sebastian  the Brother of the disguised  Viola  for the beautiful Page and marrying him is with very little Variation borrowed from  Bandello  but  Paolo  in the Novel is much more naturally introduced than  Sebastian  in the Play  Paolo  comes to  Esi  to seek for his Father and Sister but we are not acquainted with  Sebastian  's Motives for going to  Illyria  the Poet indeed had Business for him there and there he lugs him without the least Shadow of  a Reason for it which is left to the Imagination of the Reader to supply  The Behaviour of  Lattantio  in the Novel is more natural and consistent than the Duke's in the Play They both marry the Women that had attended on them disguised but the Difference of their Stations Circumstances and Characters makes the same Action natural in one which in the other is absurd and ridiculous  Lattantio  had been in Love with  Nicuola  but her Absence joined to the natural Inconstancy of Youth so wild and inconsiderate as his transferred his Affections from her to  Catella  she slights him and he being informed that his abandoned  Nicuola  impelled by the Violence of her Passion for him had disguised herself in Boy's Cloaths and waited on him as his Page he repents of his Falsehood and charmed with her Tenderness and Fidelity makes her his Wife  This Conduct in  Lattantio  is very natural but why should the Duke a sovereign Prince who so passionately adored  Olivia  all at once take a Resolution to marry  Viola  a Stranger whom he had never seen in her proper Garb because she had served him in Disguise 'tis absurd to suppose he could in a Moment pass from the most extravagant Passion imaginable for  Olivia  to one no less extravagant for a Person whom till then he had always believed to be a Boy and 'tis also highly improbable that a great Prince would so suddenly resolve  to marry a Girl who had no other Title to his Favour than an imprudent Passion which had carried her greatly beyond the Bounds of Decency  The Duke's Reasons for this extraordinary Action are far from being convincing  Duke  to  Viola  Your Master quits you and for your Service done him  So much against the Metal of your Sex  So far beneath your soft and tender Breeding  And since you call'd me Master for so long  Here is my Hand you shall from this Time be  Your Master's Mistress  And as  Viola  at first had not even Love to plead as an Excuse for her indecent Disguise she is still less worthy of the Fortune she was raised to  There is a great deal of true Comic Humour in the inferior Characters of this Play which are entirely of the Poet's Invention the Mistakes  Antonio  is led into by the Resemblance of  Sebastian  and  Viola  are no doubt Hints borrowed from the  Amphitrio  and the  Maenechmi  of  Plautus  for which it is probable he consulted the  French  or rather the  English  Translations of those Comedies extant in his Time but these Mistakes however  diverting take their Rise from a very improbable Circumstance  Antonio  a Sea Captain delivers  Sebastian  from the Fury of the Waves the Youth being obstinately determined to go to the Court  Antonio  who in a Seafight had done great Mischief to the Duke's Galleys resolves out of the Violence of his Friendship to follow him thither notwithstanding he knew his Life would be in manifest Danger if he was seen in  Illyria  How unaccountably extravagant is this Kindness in a Stranger what more could a long continued Friendship confirmed by mutual Obligations have produced But this Play is full of such Absurdities which might have been avoided had the Characters as well as the Action been the same with the Novel  The History of  MACBETH  collected from  Holingshed's  Chronicles of  England Scotland  and  Ireland  _IN the Reign of  Duncan  King of  Scotland  who as the Historians say was a gentle quiet and pusillanimous Prince a Mutiny arose amongst the People of  Lochaber  and one  Macdowald  a Man greatly esteemed in that Country for his rash Valour drawing many of his Relations and Friends into a Conspiracy with him took upon himself to be the chief Captain of the Rebels  The great Promises he made to all those that would join him brought every Day great Numbers from the Western Isles to his Party which being augmented by the  Kernes  and  Gulloglasses  who voluntarily came out of  Ireland  to serve him he in a short Time saw himself at the Head of a formidable Army with which engaging some of the King's Forces that were sent against him he gave  them a total Defeat and took their Commander  Malcolm  Prisoner whose Head when the Battle was over he cut off  When the News of this Defeat was brought to the King he assembled a Council to debate upon what Means they should use to quell the Rebellion  Macbeth  who was first Cousin to the King and of a Disposition as haughty cruel and revengful as  Duncan  's was mild and peaceable after secretly accusing the King's Sloth and Effeminacy as the Cause of their Troubles declared if  Banquo  and himself were put at the Head of some Forces and sent against the Rebels he would engage to give them a compleat Overthrow and so effectually extirpate them out of that Country that there should not from henceforth be a single Rebel found in it  This Promise he exactly performed for the Rebels being terrified at his Approach many of them stole secretly away from their Captain who with the Remainder being constrained to fight were totally routed by  Macbeth  Macdowald  in Despair at the ill Success of this last Battle and finding himself quite abandoned by all the Companions of his Revolt fled to a Castle in which his Wife and Children were inclosed and knowing that he was not able to defend it long against his Enemies and that if he surrendered he should  not escape with Life in a Transport of Grief and Despair he first killed his Wife and Children and then himself  Macbeth  entering the Castle in one of the Apartments found the dead Body of  Macdowald  lying on the Floor with his Wife and Children slaughtered beside him but remitting no Part of his native Cruelty at this dismal Sight he cut off the Head of  Macdowald  and sent it to the King who then lay at  Bertha  commanding the Body to be hung upon a high Gallows  The Inhabitants of the western Isles who had assisted  Macdowald  soliciting for a Pardon he fined in large Sums and those he found in  Lochaber  who had come thither to bear Arms against the King he put all to the Sword  These Troubles were scarcely appeased when Advice was brought that  Sueno  King of  Norway  was landed in  Fife  with a powerful Army to invade all  Scotland  This News rousing the King from that State of Indolence and Inactivity in which he was buried he raised Forces with all possible Speed sharing the Command of them with  Banquo  and  Macbeth  The Battle which soon after followed proved fatal to the  Scots  the  Norweigens  were victorious and  Duncan  fled to  Bertha  here after spending some Time in feigned Treaties  with his Enemies he sent Orders to  Macbeth  who still kept Part of the routed Army about him to fall upon the  Danes  who he was informed were all dissolved in Luxury and Ease  Macbeth  marched hastily to the Place where the  Danes  were encamped and first killing the Watch made a savage Slaughter of the wretched  Danes  whom he found fast asleep in full Security after a drunken Riot  Sueno  with only ten other Persons escaped and fled back to  Norway  In the midst of the Rejoicings the  Scots  made for this Victory they were alarmed with an Account that a new Fleet of  Danes  was arrived at  Kinghorne  sent thither by  Canute  King of  England  to revenge the Defeat his Brother  Sueno  had received  To resist these Enemies which were already landed and busy in spoiling the Country  Macbeth  and  Banquo  were sent with a sufficient Power who encountering the  Danes  slew Part of them and drove the rest back to their Ships those who escaped and got safe aboard their Vessels with large Sums of Money obtained Leave from  Macbeth  that such of their Friends as were slain in the last Fight might be buried at St  Colmes Inch  A short Time after as  Macbeth  and  Banquo  were riding towards  Foress  where the King then lay passing through a Field without any Company they were met suddenly by three  Women in strange Apparel resembling Creatures of another World and while they beheld them attentively much wondering at their uncommon Appearance they approached  Macbeth  and the first said  "All hail  Macbeth  Thane of  Glammis  " the second "Hail  Macbeth  Thane of  Cawder"  and the third "All hail  Macbeth  who hereafter shall be King of  Scotland"  "What Manner of Women are ye said  Banquo  extremely surprized who seem so little favourable to me to my Companion here you not only predict high Honours but the Kingdom also whereas to me you promise nothing at all"  "Yes said she who had first spoke we promise still greater Advantages to thee than him he shall reign indeed in his own Person but his End shall be unhappy nor shall he leave any Issue behind him to succeed to his Crown As for thee though thou shalt not be a King yet thy Descendants for long successive Ages shall rule the Kingdom of  Scotland"  No sooner were these Words spoke than they all vanished out of Sight  This Accident was thought at first by  Macbeth  and  Banquo  to be some Illusion of the Imagination so that  Banquo  would often jestingly call  Macbeth  King of  Scotland  and  Macbeth  in the same Manner call  Banquo  Father of many Kings but afterwards it was the common Opinion that these Women were either the Weird Sisters that is  Goddesses of Destiny or else Nymphs or Fairies who by Necromancy had obtained a Knowledge of future Events because every Thing they predicted came to pass  The Thane of  Cawder  being shortly after condemned at  Foriss  for high Treason his Honours Estates and Offices were by the King bestowed on  Macbeth  The first Part of the Prophesy being thus fulfilled  Macbeth  revolving the rest in his Mind began to consider of the Means he should use to gain the Kingdom but his first Preferment coming unexpected and unsought for he determined to wait for the Intervention of Providence to raise him to the Dignity his Wishes grasped at  While he was thus expecting the Completion of the Prophesy  Duncan  having two Sons by his Wife who was Daughter to  Seward  Earl of  Northumberland  declared  Malcolm  the eldest Prince of  Cumberland  thereby appointing him his Successor in the Kingdom immediately after his Decease  It was provided by the ancient Laws of the Kingdom that if the succeeding Prince was not of Age to take the Government upon himself at his Predecessor's Death his next Kinsman should be raised to the Throne  Macbeth  therefore seeing his Hopes frustrated by this Disposition of the King's began to form Schemes for usurping the Kingdom by Force conceiving himself greatly injured  by  Duncan  who by thus raising his Son though in his Minority to the Kingdom took away all his future Claim to it  The Words of the Weird Sisters contributed also towards confirming him in his Design of seizing upon the Crown and his Wife a haughty ambitious Woman ardently desirous of being a Queen never ceased tormenting him till she had fixed him in his Purpose  At length therefore communicating his Intentions to his most trusty Friends among whom  Banquo  was the Chief in Confidence of their promised Aid he murdered the King at  Inverness  in the sixth Year of his Reign  Then being surrounded with those Persons on whom he most depended he caused himself to be proclaimed King and went immediately to  Scone  where by general Consent he received the Investiture of the Kingdom according to the accustomed Manner  Malcolm Canmore  and  Donald Bane  the two Sons of King  Duncan  being apprehensive that  Macbeth  would take away their Lives to secure to himself the Possession of the Kingdom conveyed themselves secretly out of  Scotland  Malcolm  fled into  Cumberland  where he remained till Saint  Edward  Son of King  Etheldred  recovered the Kingdom of  England  from the Power of the  Danes  who received  him into his Protection and gave him an honourable Entertainment  Donald Bane  his Brother took Refuge in  Ireland  and was treated there with great Kindness by the King of that Land  Macbeth  after the Departure of these two Princes endeavoured by great Liberalities to engage the Affection of the Nobility and Gentry of  Scotland  to his Person and when he found himself in peaceable Possession of the Kingdom he set about reforming the Laws rooting out all the Enormities and Abuses which had crept into the Administration through the weak and slothful Disposition of  Duncan  He also made many good Laws and during the Space of ten Years governed the Realm with the utmost Prudence and Justice  But this Appearance of Equity and Zeal for the public Good was all counterfeited and only assumed to gain the Favour of the People Tyrants are always mistrustful they are in continual Fears that some other Person will rob them of their Power by the same unjust Means with which they acquired it  Macbeth  jealous of some Attempts against him no longer dissembled his Inclinations but practised and permitted all Sorts of Cruelties the Words of the three Weird Sisters were continually in his Thoughts  They promised him the Kingdom and he was possessed of it but they promised it also  to the Posterity of  Banquo  and this Prediction might in like Manner be fulfilled  To prevent it therefore he determined to murder  Banquo  and his Son and for this Purpose he invited them to a Supper at the Palace as they were returning home some Murderers whom he had ordered to plant themselves in the Road seized  Banquo  and killed him but  Fleance  favoured by the Darkness of the Night escaped and fled into  Wales  After the Murder of  Banquo  Fortune seemed to have forsaken  Macbeth  none of his Undertakings prospered every Man began to tremble for his own Life and durst not venture to appear before him all Men were afraid of him and he was afraid of all Men so that he continually sought Occasion to put all those Persons to Death of whom he had any Suspicion  His Distrust and Cruelty encreasing every Day his Thirst of Blood was never to be satisfied the forfeited Estates of the Nobility whom he thus massacred enabled him to fill his Coffers and maintain Forces to defend him against the Attempts of his Enemies  For the greater Security of his Person while he was thus exercising the most tyrannic Cruelty against his Subjects he built a strong Castle upon the Top of a high Hill called  Dunsinnane  situated in  Gowry  ten Miles from  Perth  This Hill was of such a prodigious Height that any Person standing upon the Top might almost behold all the Countries of  Angus Fife Stermond  and  Tweedale  lying as it were beneath him  The Castle then being founded on the Top of this Hill the Building of it put the Kingdom to great Expence because the Materials could not be brought up without much Time and Labour  But  Macbeth  being determined to compleat the Work soon commanded all the Thanes of every Shire throughout the Realm to come and do their Part towards the Building every Man in his Turn  At last it falling to the Turn of  Macduffe  Thane of  Fife  to build his Part he sent Workmen with all the necessary Materials and commanded them to do their Business with the utmost Diligence and Care that no Occasion of Offence might be given to the King which might make him resent his not coming in Person as the other Thanes did for he well knew that  Macbeth  both feared and suspected him for which Reason he resolved to keep out of his Way  Macbeth  coming soon after to see how the Work went on was greatly enraged to find  Macduffe  was not there and from that Time conceived an invincible Hatred against him  The Wizards in whom he greatly confided because of the Completion of the two first Prophesies had warned him to take heed of  Macduffe  who they told him was waiting for some Opportunity to destroy him  This Prediction would have determined him to put  Macduffe  immediately to Death had not a Witch whose Predictions had also great Weight with him assured him he should never be slain by any Man who was born of Woman nor overcome till  Birnam  Wood came to the Castle of  Dunsinnane  These soothing Prophesies banished all Fear out of his Mind he freely indulged the natural Cruelty of his Disposition miserably oppressing his Subjects and committing all Sorts of Outrages  At length  Macduffe  being in Fear for his own Life took a Resolution to fly into  England  hoping to prevail with  Malcolm Canmore  to claim the Crown of  Scotland  Macbeth  who in every Nobleman's House kept a domestic Spy in his Pay was soon informed of  Macduffe  's Intention he therefore came suddenly with an Army into  Fife  and besieged the Castle where  Macduffe  dwelt expecting to find him therein The Gates were immediately set open by the Servants who mistrusted no Danger but  Macbeth  enraged that  Macduffe  had escaped him he being already fled to  England  commanded his Wife and Children together with all that were found in the Castle to be slain  Macduffe  was safe in the  English  Court when the News of this shocking Cruelty was  brought him and adding to the Desire of relieving his wretched Country the Hope of his own particular Revenge he earnestly entreated Prince  Malcolm  to undertake the Recovery of his Right he represented to him in the most moving Terms the deplorable Condition into which  Scotland  was brought through the inhuman Cruelties of  Macbeth  and that the People detesting him for the Slaughters he had committed as well on the Commons as Nobility desired nothing more ardently than an Opportunity of shaking off their Yoke  Malcolm  whose Soul was filled with Compassion for the Miseries of his Countrymen sighed deeply while  Macduffe  was speaking which he perceiving again renewed his Intreaties that he would attempt the Delivery of  Scotland  assuring him he would find it no difficult Enterprize considering the Legality of his Title to the Crown and the earnest Desire of the People to have some Occasion given them to revenge themselves on their hated Tyrant  Malcolm  though he was greatly affected with  Macduffe  's Discourse yet doubting whether he was not sent by  Macbeth  to betray him he determined to make Tryal of his Sincerity before he consented to his Proposal for which Purpose he spoke to him in this Manner  "I am truly sorry  Macduffe  for the Miseries under which my unhappy Country has long  groaned but though my Inclination to relieve it were equal to your Wishes yet on account of some incurable Vices which are rooted in my Disposition I am not fit to undertake so great an Enterprize for first I am so swallowed up in immoderate Lust and Sensuality the abominable Springs of all other Vices that if I was possessed of the regal Power the Chastity of none of your Maids and Wives would be safe and such excessive Intemperance would be more insupportable to you than the bloody Tyranny of  Macbeth"  "Intemperance replied  Macduffe  is certainly a very great Fault many noble Kings and Princes have lost both their Kingdoms and Lives by indulging themselves in this Vice nevertheless there are Women enough in  Scotland  to serve your Pleasures follow my Council therefore and make yourself King I'll take upon myself the Care of gratifying this Passion for Women in so secret a Manner that your Reputation shall not be hurt by it"  "But replied  Malcolm  I am also the most avaritious Man in the World and if I was King of  Scotland  I should put the greatest Part of the Nobility to Death that I might possess myself of their Estates"  "This Fault said  Macduffe  is much worse than the other for Avarice is the Source of all Evil a Crime for which most of our Kings have been murdered yet still I must  continue to advise you to claim the Crown there are Riches enough in  Scotland  to satisfy your greedy Desire"  "I am also said  Malcolm  strongly inclined to Dissimulation and every other Kind of Deceit and rejoice in nothing so much as betraying those who put any Confidence in me since there is not any Thing then more agreeable to the Character of a Prince than Constancy Truth and Justice and I am wholly abandoned to the contrary Vices you see how unfit I am to reign and therefore since you have found the Means of extenuating all my other Faults I pray you endeavour to cover them among the rest"  "Dissimulation replied  Macduffe  is indeed the worst of all here then I leave thee" "And oh unhappy and miserable  Scotchmen  added he that are scourged with so many unavoidable Calamities The wicked Tyrant who now without any Right or Title reigns over ye oppresses ye with the most bloody Cruelty and this other who has a lawful Claim to the Crown is so replete with all the shameful Vices of the  English  that he is unworthy to enjoy it for by his own Confession he is not only avaritious to the last Degree but wholly abandoned to the most insatiable Lust and is withal so false a Traitor that no Credit can be given to any Thing he says Farewell then  Scotland  for ever I now look upon myself as a banished Man without any Hope of Comfort or Relief" Saying this he wept bitterly  Malcolm  observing he was about to depart took him by the Hand and said "Be comforted  Macduff  for I have none of these Vices you lament I have jested with you in this Manner only to try your Sincerity for many Times hath  Macbeth  sought by these Means to get me into his Hands but the more backward I have shewn myself to agree to your Request the more Diligence shall I use in accomplishing it Hereupon they embraced promising to be faithful to each other's Interest and then consulted together how they might best put their Enterprize in Execution  Macduff  soon after repairing to the Borders or  Scotland  secretly dispatched Letters to the Nobles of the Realm in which he declared that  Malcolm  intended to come suddenly into  Scotland  and claim the Crown and therefore required them since that Prince was the true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom to assist them with all their Power to recover it out of the Hands of the Usurper  In the mean time  Malcolm  so far engaged the Favour of King  Edward  that old  Seyward  Earl of  Northumberland  with ten thousand Men was appointed to go with him into  Scotland  to support him in his Pretensions on that Crown  When the News of this intended Invasion was spread abroad in  Scotland  the Nobles formed themselves into two different Parties  the one taking Part with  Macbeth  the other with  Malcolm  Between these two Factions there frequently happened light Skirmishes but those that were of  Malcolm  's Side would not risk the Danger of engaging in a pitched Battle till they were joined by  Malcolm  and the  English  Forces under the Command of  Northumberland  Macbeth  therefore not thinking himself able to engage the  English  retired into  Fife  and fortifying a Camp near the Castle of  Dunsinane  determined not to hazard a Battle unless his Enemies pursued him thither  However some of his Friends advised him either to make a Treaty with  Malcolm  or else to fly immediately into the Isles and take his Treasure with him to the End that he might be able to engage several of the great Princes of the Realm in his Interest and retain Strangers in his Pay in whom he might better confide than in his own Subjects who were every Day abandoning him  But he had so firm a Reliance on his Prophecies that he believed he should never be vanquished till  Birnam  Wood came to  Dunsinane  nor be slain by any Man that was born of a Woman  Malcolm  who had hastily pursued  Macbeth  came the Night before the Battle to  Birnam  Wood and when his Army had rested there awhile he commanded every Man to cut down a Branch of a Tree and march with it in his Hand that thus shaded they might come  closely without discovering their Numbers within View of their Enemies  The next Day when  Macbeth  beheld them he was greatly astonished and the Prophecy that had been delivered to him long before coming into his Mind he doubted not but that it was now fulfilled since he saw  Birnam  Wood coming to  Dunsinane  nevertheless he drew up his Men in Order of Battle exhorting them to fight valiantly  His Enemies however had scarcely cast away their Boughs when  Macbeth  perceiving their Numbers betook himself to Flight  Macduff  stimulated with Hatred and an eager Thirst of Revenge never ceased pursuing him till he came up with him at  Lunfannain  and  Macbeth  seeing him close at his Heels leaped off his Horse crying aloud "Thou Traitor why dost thou thus follow me in vain since I am not appointed to be slain by any Man that is born of a Woman But come on then and receive the Reward thou hast merited for thy Folly" Hereupon he aimed a Blow at him with his Sword thinking to have killed him but  Macduff  suddenly leaping off his Horse avoided the Stroke and holding his naked Sword in his Hand thus answered  "It is true  Macbeth  and now shalt thy insatiable Cruelty have an End for I I am he whom thy Wizards have told thee of not born of my Mother but ripped out of her Womb" then suddenly closing with him he  slew him on the Place and cutting off his Head from his Shoulders fixed it upon a Poll and brought it to  Malcolm  This was the End of  Macbeth  after he had reigned over  Scotland  seventeen Years In the Beginning of his Reign he performed many worthy Actions and made many Laws very useful to the Commonwealth but afterwards thro' the Illusion of the Devil he obliterated the Glory of his good Deeds by the most detestable Cruelty  OBSERVATIONS  on the Use  Shakespear  has made of the foregoing History of  Macbeth  The Plan of  MACBETH  MACBETH  a near Kinsman of  Duncan  King of  Scotland  having in one Day quelled a Rebellion and given a total Defeat to the Army of the King of  Norway  who invaded  Scotland  as he was returning to Court with his Friend  Banquo  meets three Witches on a barren Heath the first of whom hails him Thane of  Glamis  the second Thane of  Cawdor  and the Third with the Title of King hereafter  Banquo  offended at their addressing themselves only to his Friend desires them to speak likewise to him upon which they prophesy that he shall be happier than  Macbeth  and though he shall not sway a Scepter himself yet his Descendants shall be Kings this said they vanished immediately  While  Macbeth  and  Banquo  are expressing their Surprize to each other at this Prodigy  some Noblemen sent by the King salute  Macbeth  with the Title of Thane of  Cawdor  Macbeth  astonished at the Completion of this first Prophecy entertains a Design of murdering the King to make Way for the fulfilling of the second and artfully sounds the Inclinations of  Banquo  but finding him fixed in his Loyalty to the King he forbears to tamper with him  The King declaring his Intentions to bestow the Title of Prince of  Cumberland  on his eldest Son  Malcolm Macbeth  alarmed at this resolves to be sudden in the Execution of his Designs and by a Letter acquaints his Wife with the Prophecies of the Witches one of which he tells her had been already accomplished  Lady  Macbeth  a proud ambitious and cruel Woman urges on her Husband to the Murder of the King and accordingly  Duncan  coming to lodge one Night at  Macbeth  's Castle in  Inverness  he is stabbed in his Bed by  Macbeth  The two Sons of  Duncan  fearing the same Fate fly from  Scotland  and  Macbeth  usurps the Crown  Some time after being jealous of the promised Sovereignty to  Banquo  's Children he causes  Banquo  to be murdered but his Son  Fleance  whom he ordered likewise to be dispatched escapes out of the Hands of the Murderers and saves himself by Flight  Macbeth  pressed by uneasy Doubts about his own Security goes to the three Witches who had predicted his Greatness to have them resolved they raise Apparitions who bid him beware of  Macduff  the Thane of  Fife  but at the same Time assure him that none of Woman born should have Power to hurt him and that he should never be vanquished till  Birnam  Wood came to the Hill of  Dunsinane  Macbeth  elated with these Promises sets no Bound is to his Cruelty and resolves to murder  Macduff  but being told he is fled to  England  he seizes upon his Castle at  Fife  and puts his Wife his Children and all that were found within it to the Sword  In the mean time  Malcolm  the eldest Son of King  Duncan  having prevailed upon the King of  England  with whom he had taken Refuge to furnish him with an Army marches into  Scotland  accompanied by  Macduff  who breathes nothing but Revenge against the Tyrant that had deprived him of his Wife and Children  Macbeth  hearing of their Approach and being daily informed of the Desertion of his Officers and Soldiers fortifies the Castle of  Dunsinane  and confiding in the Promises of the Spirits prepares to fight  Malcolm  when he comes into  Birnam  Wood with his Army commands every Man to cut him down a Bough and carry it before him in  order to conceal their Numbers from the Enemy a Centinel of  Macbeth  's surprized at this strange Appearance informs him that as he was looking towards  Birnam  on a sudden he perceived the Wood to move  Macbeth grows furious at this Account but still relying on the Promise of the last Spirit "that he should not be hurt by one of Woman born" he goes into the Field and being met by  Macduff  who in Answer to his Boasts of bearing a charmed Life tells him "he was not born of his Mother but ripped from her Womb" he despairs curses and being forced to fight is killed by  Macduff  The Conqueror cuts off his Head and carries it to  Malcolm  whose Troops having gained a compleat Victory he is proclaimed King of  Scotland  Lady  Macbeth  tormented with horrible Imaginations deprives herself of Life before the decisive Battle is fought in which  Macbeth  is slain  Shakespear  has pretty exactly followed the Thread of the History in this Play which takes in Part of the Life of  Duncan  and the whole Reign of  Macbeth  Some few Variations he has made for the Sake of diversifying his Characters and contracting the Action as when he shews  Banquo  unshaken in his Loyalty to his King though the Historians say he joined with  Macbeth  in his Conspiracy and assisted in the murder of  Duncan  and making  Macbeth  defeat the Rebels and subdue the King of  Norway  in one Day when according to the Historian there was a long Interval  of Time between these two Actions in which several other Battles were fought  It is not to be doubted but  Shakespear  followed  Hollingshed  in the Facts which compose this Play as well as in many of his other historical Plays In the History of  Macbeth  where he found  Hollingshed  's Chronicle deficient he probably consulted  Bellendon  who translated  Boetius  in  "The Incongruity of all the Passages in which the Thane of  Cawdor  is mentioned says the celebrated Author of the  Rambler  in a Pamphlet intitled  Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of  Macbeth is very remarkable in the second Scene the Thanes of  Rosse  and  Angus  bring the King an Account of the Battle and inform him that  Norway  Assisted by that most disloyal Traitor  The Thane of  Cawdor  'gan a dismal Conflict  "It appears that  Cawdor  was taken Prisoner for the King says in the same Scene  Go pronounce his Death  And with his former Title greet  Macbeth  "Yet though  Cawdor  was thus taken by  Macbeth  in Arms against the King when  Macbeth  is saluted in the fourth Scene Thane of  Cawdor  by the Weird Sisters he asks  How of  Cawdor  The Thane of  Cawdor  lives  A prosperous Gentleman  "And in the next Line considers the Promises that he should be  Cawdor  and King as equally unlikely to be accomplished  "How can  Macbeth  be ignorant of the State of the Thane of  Cawdor  whom he has just defeated and taken Prisoner or call him a  prosperous Gentleman  who has forfeited his Title and Life by open Rebellion Or why should he wonder that the Title of the Rebel whom he has overthrown should be conferred upon him  "He cannot be supposed to dissemble his Knowledge of the Condition of  Cawdor  because he enquires with all the Ardour of Curiosity and the Vehemence of sudden Astonishment and because nobody is present but  Banquo  who had an equal Part of the Battle and was equally acquainted with  Cawdor  's Treason  "However in the next Scene his Ignorance still continues and when  Rosse  and  Angus  present him from the King with his new Title he cries out  The Thane of  Cawdor  lives  Why do you dress me in his borrow'd Robes  "Rosse and  Angus  who were the Messengers that in the second Scene informed the King of the Assistance given by  Cawdor  to the Invader having lost as well as  Macbeth  all Memory of what they had so lately seen and related make this Answer  Whether he was  Combined with  Norway  or did line the Rebels  With hidden Help and Vantage or with both  He labour'd in his Country's Wreck I know not  "Neither  Rosse  knew what he had just reported nor  Macbeth  what he had just done  "This seems not to be one of the Faults that are to be imputed to the Transcribers since though the Inconsistency of  Rosse  and  Angus  might be removed by supposing that their Names are erroneously inserted and that only  Rosse  brought the Account of the Battle and only  Angus  was sent to compliment  Macbeth  yet the Forgetfulness of  Macbeth  cannot be palliated since what he says could not be spoken by any other  "Shakespear  by deviating from History in making  Banquo  loyal and virtuous had not only in View the contrasting his Character with  Macbeth  's but also a Compliment to King  James  the First in whose Reign this Play was written and was lineally descended from  Banquo  "The Prophecy of the Witches in the first Act absolutely promises the Crown of  Scotland  to the Posterity of  Banquo  Upon this Prophecy it is that  Macbeth  causes  Banquo  to be murdered yet still the Escape of  Fleance  the Son of  Banquo  leaves  Macbeth  Room to suspect that the Kingdom would after his Death devolve to that Family his Fears on this Occasion are so frequently and strongly inculcated in the Play that though we have reason to conclude it is accompplished from the Words of  Macbeth  at the Sight of the Royal Apparitions with twofold Balls and treble Scepters  Mac  Horrible Sight Nay now I see 't is true  For the Bloodbolter'd  Banquo  smiles upon me  And points at them for his  "Yet it is to be wished that  Shakespear  had made Use of the prophesying Witches to hint at the Means by which this Change in the Succession was to be made Thus it is related in  Boetius"  "Fleance  after the Murder of his Father being protected by the Darkness of the Night and having for some Time concealed himself in  Scotland  escaped into  Wales  where the Strength of his Judgment and Affability of his Temper recommended him very soon after his Arrival to the Protection and Favour of the Prince of that Country  "Prosperity raised his Ambition to an unpardonable Height he abused the Confidence reposed in him by secretly paying unlawful Addresses to the young Princess the Daughter of his Benefactor Those Addresses proved successful her Father discovered her Pregnancy and that  Fleance  was her Paramour  Fleance  was put to Death and the Lady as soon as she was delivered of her Child which proved to be a Son and was named  Walter  was condemned to pass the rest of her Life in the Character of a mean Domestic Young  Walter  by Order of his enraged Grandfather was sent to a remote Part of  Wales  to be educated as a Rustic  "When he had attained his twentieth Year the Blood which flowed in his Veins inspired him with Sentiments far nobler and more refined than those of his usual Companions he left the Country and threw himself boldly into the Protection of his Grandfather at Court This noble Resolution was not entirely unsuccessful he was admitted to stay in the Palace but in a mean and servile Station  "One of the Courtiers with whom he had quarrelled reproached him with the Illegitimacy of his Birth  Walter  was transported with Fury at the Affront and slew the Person who offered it to him  "He was too sensible of his Grandfather's Severity to venture the Effects of it on this Occasion he fled immediately to  Scotland  and implored Protection from his Relations there  "He met with a favourable Reception from them and was particularly honoured and esteemed by some  English  Noblemen who were at that Time in the Court of  Scotland  upon an Embassy to  Margaret  who was then Queen of that Nation  "He became afterwards General for that Princess in  Galloway  and the  Western Islands  and having gained a compleat Victory over the Rebels of those Parts was made High Seneschall of the Kingdom and Lord of several noble Manors among which was that of  Stuart  's  Islands  "He left at his Death a Son named  Allan Stuart  who signalized his Valour on many Occasions against the  Saracens  in the  Holy Land Alexander  his Son succeeded him and was Founder of  PaisleyAbbey Alexander  was followed by his Son  Walter  surnamed of  Dundonald  a famous General under  Alexander  the Third  Walter  had two Sons  Alexander  and  Robert  who married the Daughter of  Robert  of  Cruxtoun  from which Marriage the Families of  Darnley  and  Lennox  are descended  "Alexander  the eldest Son of  Walter  of  Dundonald  left two Sons  James  and  John James  died in his Infancy and  John  having espoused the Heiress of  Boutell  had Issue by her  Walter Stuart  who married  Margaret  Daughter of King  Robert Bruce  after the civil Dissentions of  Scotland  were entirely appeased By this Princess he had  Robert Stuart  afterwards King of  Scotland  and from him the Royal Family of  Stuart  is lineally descended"  This long Account of the Posterity of  Banquo  will I hope not seem unentertaining to the Admirers of  Shakespear  who will thereby see with what Judgment that great Poet has deviated from History in giving Loyalty and Virtue to the Character of this Father of many Kings  The Character of  Macbeth  is drawn after the Historians yet  Shakespear  has softened a little some of the most rugged Features he shews him doubtful and irresolute about the Murder of the King spurred on by Ambition to commit it but restrained by his Abhorrence of the Action and when by the Instigations of his Wife he is prevailed upon to do it his Mind is afterwards filled with Remorse and all the uneasy Sensations that attend repentant Guilt  The Character  Macbeth  gives of  Duncan  in the Play is not inconsistent with that in the History yet it is not the same  Macbeth  speaks only of his Virtues and his Faults were those Virtues carried to Excess  The Instigation used by Lady  Macbeth  and the Fire of his Temper are touched upon by  Boetius  but improved by  Shakespear  with all the Force of Words and Propriety of Character  The Wife of  Macbeth  says  Boetius  inspired him with Ambition to the utmost of her Power she was ardently desirous of the royal Title and was wicked and bold enough to  undertake any Enterprize and was impetuous in the Prosecution of it  She prompted  Macbeth  to the Murder of the King by the most provoking Expressions reproaching him with Cowardice and Sloth as negligent to receive what Fate had directed to obtain  That the Glory of Reigning had inspired many Men to pursue the empty Name of King without the actual Power even at the Expence of their Lives  The machinary Part of this Play is so beautifully defended and illustrated by the ingenious Mr  Johnson  in the abovementioned Pamphlet that I think I cannot confer a greater Obligation on the Reader than by transcribing those Passages here  "In order to make a true Estimate of the Abilities and Merit of a Writer it is always necessary to examine the Genius of his Age and the Opinions of his Contemporaries"  "A Poet who should now make the whole Action of his Tragedy depend upon Enchantment and produce the chief Events by the Assistance of supernatural Agents would be censured as transgressing the Bounds of Probability he would be banished from the Theatre to the Nursery and condemned to write Fairy Tales instead of Tragedies"  "But a Survey of the Notions that prevailed at the Time when this Play was written  will prove that  Shakespear  was in no Danger of such Censures since he only turned the System that was then universally admitted to his Advantage and was far from overburthening the Credulity of his Audience"  "The Reality of Witchcraft or Enchantment which though not strictly the same are confounded in this Play has in all Ages and Countries been credited by the common People and in most by the Learned themselves"  "These Phantoms have indeed appeared more frequently in Proportion as the Darkness of Ignorance has been more gross but it cannot be shewn that the brightest Gleams of Knowledge have at any Time been sufficient to drive them out of the World"  "The Time in which this Kind of Credulity was at its Height seems to have been that of the Holy War in which the Christians imputed all their Defeats to Enchantments or diabolical Opposition as they ascribed their Success to the Assistance of their Military Saints And the learned Mr W appears to believe Supplement to the Introduction to  Don Quixote  that the first Accounts of Enchantments were brought into this Part of the World by those who returned from their Eastern Expeditions"  "But there is always some Distance between the Birth and Maturity of Folly as of Wickedness This Opinion had long existed though perhaps the Application of it had  in no foregoing Age been so frequent nor the Reception so general  Olympiodorus  in  Photius  's Extracts tells us of one  Libanius  who practised this Kind of military Magic and having promised to perform great Things against the  Barbarians  without Soldiers was at the Instances of the Empress  Placidia  put to Death when he was about to have given Proofs of his Abilities The Empress shewed some Kindness in her Anger by cutting him off at a Time so convenient to his Reputation  "But a more remarkable Proof of the Antiquity of this Notion may be found in St  Chrysostom  's Book  de Sacerdotis  which exhibits a Scene of Enchantments not exceeded by any Romance of the middle Age he supposes a Spectator overlooking a Field of Battle attended by one that points out all the various Objects of Horror the Engines of Destruction and the Arts of Slaughter Let him then proceed to shew him in the opposite Armies Horses flying by Enchantment armed Men transported through the Air and every Power and Form of Magic  "Whether St  Chrysostom  believed that such Performances were really to be seen in a Day of Battle or only endeavoured to inliven his Description by adopting the Notions of the Vulgar it is equally certain that such Notions were in his Time received and that therefore they were not imported from the  Saracens  in a later Age the Wars with the  Saracens  however gave Occasion to their Propagation not only as Bigotry naturally discovers Prodigies but as the Scene of Action was removed to a great Distance and Distance either of Time or Place is sufficient to reconcile weak Minds to wonderful Relations  "The Reformation did not immediately arrive at its Meridian and though the Day gradually encreased upon us the Goblins of Witchcraft still continued to hover in the Twilight In the Time of Queen  Elizabeth  was the remarkable Trial of the Witches of  Warbois  whose Conviction is still commemorated in an annual Sermon at  Huntingdon  But in the Reign of King  James  in which this Tragedy was written many Circumstances concurred to propagate and confirm this Opinion  "The King who was much celebrated for his Knowledge had before his Arrival in  England  not only examined in Person a Woman accused of Witchcraft but had given a very formal Account of the Practices and Illusions of evil Spirits the Compacts of Witches the Ceremonies used by them the Manner of detecting them and the Justice of punishing them in his Dialogues of  Daemonologie  written in the Scottish Dialect and published at  Edinburgh  "This Book was soon after his Accession reprinted at  London  and as the ready Way to  gain King  James  's Favour was to flatter his Speculations the System of  Daemonologie  was immediately adopted by all who desired either to gain Preferment or not to lose it"  "Thus the Doctrine of Witchcraft was very powerfully inculcated and as the greatest Part of Mankind have no other Reason for their Opinions than that they are in Fashion it cannot be doubted but this Persuasion made a rapid Progress since Vanity and Credulity cooperated in it's Favour and it had a Tendency to free Cowardice from Reproach"  "The Infection soon reached the Parliament who in the first Year of King  James  made a Law by which it was enacted  Ch  That if any Person shall use any Invocation or Conjuration of any evil or wicked Spirit Or shall consult covenant with entertain employ feed or reward any evil or cursed Spirit to or for any Intent or Purpose Or take up any dead Man Woman or Child out of the Grave or the Skin Bone or any Part of the dead Person to be employed or used in any Manner of Witchcraft Sorcery Charm or Enchantment Or shall use practise or exercise any Sort of Witchcraft Sorcery Charm or Enchantment Whereby any Person shall be destroyed killed wasted consumed pined or lamed in any Part of the Body That every such Person being convicted shall suffer Death"  "Thus in the Time of  Shakespear  was the Doctrine of Witchcraft at once established by Law and by the Fashion and it became not only unpolite but criminal to doubt it and as Prodigies are always seen in Proportion as they are expected Witches were every Day discovered and multiplied so fast in some Places that Bishop  Hall  mentions a Village in  Lancashire  where their Number was greater than that of the Houses"  "The Jesuits and Sectaries took Advantage of this universal Error and endeavoured to promote the Interest of their Parties by pretended Cures of Persons afflicted by evil Spirits but they were detected and exposed by the Clergy of the established Church"  "Upon this general Infatuation  Shakespear  might be easily allowed to found a Play especially since he has followed with great Exactness such Histories as were then thought true nor can it be doubted that the Scenes of Enchantment however they may now be rediculed were both by himself and his Audience thought awful and affecting"  The Note on the first Scene of the fourth Act explains the Nature of the Incantations and diabolical Ceremonies made Use of by the Witches I shall therefore give the Reader the Pleasure of seeing it here"  "As this is the chief Scene of Enchantment in the Play it is proper in this Place to observe with how much Judgment  Shakespear  has selected all the Circumstances of his infernal Ceremonies and how exactly he has conformed to common Opinions and Traditions"  Thrice the brinded Cat hath mewed  "The usual Form in which familiar Spirits are reported to converse with Witches is that of a Cat A Witch who was tried about half a Century before the Time of  Shakespear  had a Cat named  Rutterkin  as the Spirit of one of those Witches was  Grimalkin  and when any Mischief was to be done she used to bid  Rotterkin  go and fly but once when she would have sent  Rutterkin  to torment a Daughter of the Countess of  Rutland  instead of going or flying she only cried  Mew  from which she discovered that the Lady was out of his Power the Power of Witches being not universal but limited as  Shakespear  has taken Care to inculcate"  Though his Bark cannot be lost  Yet it shall be Tempest tost  "The common Afflictions which the Malice of Witches produced was Melancholy Fits and Loss of Flesh which are threatened by one of  Shakespear  's Witches"  Weary Sev'nnights nine Times nine  Shall he dwindle peak and pine  "It was likewise their Practice to destroy the Cattle of their Neighbours and the Farmers have to this Day many Ceremonies to secure their Cows and other Cattle from Witchcraft but they seem to have been most suspected of Malice against Swine"  "Shakespear  has accordingly made one of his Witches declare that she has been  killing Swine  and Doctor  Harsenet  observes that about that Time a Sow could not be ill of the Measles nor a Girl of the Sullens but some old Woman was charged with Witchcraft"  Toad that under the cold Stone  Days and Nights has forty one  Swelter'd Venom sleeping got  Boil thou first i' th' charmed Pot  "Toads have likewise long lain under the Reproach of being by some Means accessary to Witchcraft for which Reason  Shakespear  in the first Scene of this Play calls one of the Spirits  Padocke  or  Toad  and now takes Care to put a Toad first into the Pot"  "When  Varinus  was seized at  Tholouse  there was found at his Lodgings  ingens Bufo Vitro inclusus  a great Toad shut in a Phial upon which those who prosecuted him  Vinéficium exprobabant  charged him I suppose with Witchcraft"  Fillet of a fenny Snake  In the Cauldron boil and bake  Eye of Neut and Toe of Frog  For a Charm  c  "The Propriety of these Ingredients may be known by consulting the Books  de Veribus Animalium  and  de Mirabilibus Mundi  ascribed to  Albertus Magnus  in which the Reader who has Time and Credulity may discover very wonderful Secrets"  Finger of birthstrangled Babe  Ditchdeliver'd by a Drab  "It has been already mentioned in the Law against Witches that they are supposed to take up dead Bodies to use in Enchantments which was confessed by the Woman whom King  James  examined and who had of a dead Body that was divided in one of their Assemblies two Fingers for her Share"  "It is observable that  Shakespear  on this great Occasion which involves the Fate of a King multiplies all the Circumstances of Horror"  "The Babe whose Finger is used must be strangled in its Birth the Grease must not be human but must have dropped from a Gibbet the Gibbet of a Murderer and even the Sow whose Blood is used must have offended Nature by devouring her own Farrow These are Touches of Judgment and Genius"  And now about the Cauldron sing  Blue Spirits and white  Black Spirits and grey  Mingle mingle mingle  You that mingle may  And in a former Part  Weird Sisters Hand in Hand  Thus do go about about  Thrice to mine and thrice to thine  And thrice again to make up nine  "These two Passages I have brought together because they both seem subject to the Objection of too much Levity for the Solemnity of Enchantment and may both be shewn by one Quotation from  Camden  's Account of  Ireland  to be founded upon a Practice really observed by the uncivilized Natives of that Country  "When any one gets a Fall says the Informer of  Camden  he starts up and turning three Times to the Right digs a Hole in the Earth for they imagine that there is a Spirit in the Ground and if he falls sick in two or three Days they send one of their Women that is skilled in that Way to the Place where he says I call thee from the East West North and South from the Groves the Woods the Rivers and the Fens from the Fairies Red Black and White  "There was likewise a Book written before the Time of  Shakespear  describing among other Properties the Colours of Spirits"  The learned and ingenious Mr  Upton  in his critical Observations on  Shakespear  has discovered a Beauty that has escaped all his other Commentators "The Apparitions he says who are introduced paltering with  Macbeth  in  a double Sense and leading him on according to the common Notions of diabolical Oracles to his Confusion are themselves symbolical Representations of what shall happen to him  "The armed Head who bids him beware of  Macduff  represents symbolically  Macbeth  's Head cut off and brought to  Malcolm  by  Macduff  The bloody Child who assures him that none of Woman born should have Power to hurt him is  Macduff  untimely ripped from his Mother's Womb And the Child with a Crown on his Head and a Bough in his Hand who tells him he shall never be vanquished till  Bernam  Wood comes to  Dunsinane  is the royal  Malcolm  who ordered his Soldiers to hew them down a Bough and bear it before them till they come to  Dunsinane"  Shakespear  seems to have committed a great Oversight in making  Macbeth  after he found himself deceived in the Prophecy relating to  Birnam  Wood so absolutely rely upon the other which he had good Reason to fear might be equally fallacious When the Messenger tells him he saw  Birnam  Wood begin to move and that it was coming towards  Dunsinane  he falls into a Transport of Grief and Despair and owns he doubts the Equivocation of the Fiend yet carries his Reflexions no farther than the present Ciscumstance Though it might naturally be expected from the Conviction of the Falsehood of one Prophecy upon which he had built such solid Hopes that the  Truth of another which promised him Security from all Men of Women born might be justly suspected by him yet in the Field of Battle a little after that we find him as full of Confidence on that Prediction as if his Spirits had never deceived him  What's he  That was not born of Woman such a one  Am I to fear or none  And again  Swords I smile at Weapons laugh to Scorn  Brandish'd by Man that's of a Woman born  And when challenged to Fight by  Macduff  he says  Thou losest Labour  As easy mayst thou the intrenchant Air  With thy keen Sword impress as make me bleed  Let fall thy Blade on vulnerable Crests  I bear a charmed Life which must not yield  To one of Woman born  How inconsistent is this vainglorious Boasting and extravagant Confidence in a Man who having been just before told that the Wood was moving makes the following Speech  If thou speak'st false  Upon the next Tree shalt thou hang alive  'Till Famine cling thee If thy Speech be sooth  I care not if thou dost for me as much  I pull in Resolution and begin  To doubt th' Equivocation of the Fiend  That lies like Truth Fear not 'till  Bernam  Wood  Comes to  Dunsinane  And now a Wood  Comes towards Dunsinane Arm arm and out  If this which he avouches does appear  There is not flying hence nor tarrying here  I'gin to be a weary of the Sun  And wish the State o' th' World were now undone  Ring the alarum Bell blow Wind come Wrack  At least we'll die with Harness on our Back  But this Play has fewer Faults of this Kind than any other of  Shakespear's  and is deservedly allowed to be a most beautiful Piece  End of the First Volume
