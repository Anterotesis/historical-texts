castle in the Forest of Ostropol  CHORUS of TARTARS  ITHORAKKHOR  Let's advance we see no danger  All around is hush as night  JAPHIS and other TARTARS  To each heart pale fear's a stranger  Honour bids us to the fight  KERA KHAN KAJAH TAMURI CAMAZIN and The rest of the TARTARS  CHORUSHORDE  Kera Khan whene'er you head us  Dauntless to the charge we go  Gallant chief then instant lead us  On to conquest and our foe  Kera Khan  Here my friends here stands the castle of LovinskiThis cruel Polander is the scourge of his own little territory and a devouring plague to our Tartar tribes but the hour of retribution is at handWe are too few to storm it now tomorrow's dawnI lose timeAttend line all the outlets of the forest and seize on every passenger you meet with but I command you spare the lives of those who fall into your handsRemember my brave comrades the innocent should never suffer for the guilty nor must we purchase our revenge at the price of justice and humanity To your postsbegone    Exeunt all the Tartars except  Kera Khan  and  Ithorak  The day declines apace much is to be done before morningNo stragglers to give informationno watch upon the towersthe ramparts nakedIs this fear or designNo matter whichCome let us examine farther the situation of this devoted fortress  Exeunt  Enter COUNT FLORESKI  AIR  Lodoiska wide over the world  I'll roam till I find thee my Fair  Thy charms shall banish  Cold despair  Love's torch shall illume  The desert's thick gloom  And guide with cheering ray  Thy pilgrim's doubtful way  But alas  Should cruel destiny ordain  That our true love  Must hapless prove  And we are ne'er to meet again  It's malice I'll defy  And for my Lodoiska die  Enter VARBEL with a Portmantua  Varbel  Vastly well Sir vastly well you seem in tip top spirits sing away sing away I told you I saw the Portmantua fall but the Tartars have gallop'd clear off with the poor beasts I thought them as safe grazing there as if they had been in our own stablesWell we have miss'd the road to the village and here we are wand'ring on foot in the heart of the forest of Ostropol  Count  It was your fault that they discovered the horses  Varbel  Yes and it was my fault too that they did not discover usA housethen all my fears are over I thought we should never have found an end to this black wood and to tell you the truth I had made up my mind to the comfortable prospect of passing the night in the arms of one of the bears that were howling about usWon't you go in Sirthough I see nobody there to open the door to us  Count  I shall gain no intelligence in this sequestered corner I don't know what to do  Varbel  I know what you should not have done you shouldn't have giv'n your vote to a candidate who was oppos'd by your mistress's proud father  Count  Not given itCalled to the election o  a king honour exacted the performance of my promise my friend obtain'd the crown of Poland I discharged my duty to my country and we should hold every sacrifice cheap to maintain a good man on a throne  Varbel  Very true Sir but all of a sudden you seem to forget that for that very reason prince Lupauski has discharged himself of his promise to give you his daughter Lodoiska  Count  Cruel father Why so mysteriously conceal the place of her retreat  Varbel  But dear Sir consider she can't be conceal'd for ever Now wou'dn't it be more natural to get back to Warsaw as fast as we can and wait there 'till her father sends for the princess home again It must happen sooner or later That's certainly the best way and for my part I won't budge a step further for all the Lodoiskas in Christendom  Count  Is this your regard your fidelity Come on this moment or  Varbel  Sir recollect we have fasted all day I can't live upon love if you can I am almost starv'd and I must eatI did not fetch the portmantean for nothingI can't stir  Count  Wretch you are for ever embittering  my griefs with your upbraidingsWhy wou'd you follow me  Varbel  Whywhy wou'd I follow you Why because my heart got the better of my head and made me resolve in spite of common sense to accompany your search that I might carry half the load of your griefs for you  Count  Forgive me my true fellow  Varbel  Come don't be melancholy I won't eat if you don't like itI must try to divert him It's I that have most cause to be out of spirits every thing going on so smooth with the old prince the happy morning fix'd with the young princess there was I practising how to behave myself as master of the ceremonies among the musicians singers dancers lords and ladies on your wedding day  SONG  I  Hark hark the music  Oh charming dinning  The guests are seated  They're all beginning  With the dancing fiddle  Shrillsqueaking hautboy  The tinkling harp too  Soft am'rous slute sir  The lively trumpet  The drum so angry  The bells so merry  The buzzing cymbal  The grumbling basso  And these delights I've lost  By your wedding's being crost  II  Look look

Enter LODOISKA from the Tower with the Ribband in her Fland  Lodoiska  The night is almost pass'd and day stands ready to dawn upon the mountainsOh Floreski in vain I have watch'd for thy expected letterMy heart sinks in me with the sear of having betray'd thee into the hands of Lovinski I knew thy faithful love I knew thy impetuous valourWhy did I reveal myselfYet will I hopeKind hope thou only friend that visitest the unhappy dwell with me still and calm the crowding terrors that oppress me  AIR  I  Ye streams that round my prison creep  If on your mossy banks you see  My gallant lover stand and weep  Oh murmur this command from me  Thy mistress bids thee haste away  And shun the broadey'd watchful day  II  Ye gales that love with me to sigh  If in your breezy slight you see  My dear Floreski ling'ring nigh  Oh whisper this command from me  Thy mistress bids thee haste away  And shun the broadey'd watchful day  Hark yes I hear a noiseLet me retire to my sad prison till I

moment too So I have lost my master in the dark and now if any of the gentlemen of this humane family happen to stumble upon me my poor dear life's not worth a minute's purchaseHe's poring about after his Lodoiska the deuse a bit does he think of meThough our window was double and treble barr'd and barricado'd he burst away the bolts with a snap of his finger and I believe like Mr What d'ye call him he'd have burst the gates of Hell to come at his mistressI can't conceive what's the matter with me to night I see Spectres and Phantoms before me at every turn If a man cou'd administer courage to himself when he wanted it I'd take a good dose of it now and yet I dare say some people wou'd be much more frighten'd than I amMercy on us what's that  Reenter the COUNT  Count  My search is all in vain  Varbel  Oh is it nothing but you Sir  Count  Varbel Why did not you wait in the room as I order'd you  Varbel  I don't know how it is but to tell you the truth Sir I'm lately grown a little afraid of keeping my own company  Count  His fears will ruin me at lastAfraid You who fought so bravely against the Tartars  Varbel  I tell you what I'll fight the Devil himself by day light but a ghost in the dark is quite another thing  Count  Must all my hazards then prove fruitless  Varbel  Yes we have pass'd the night here to very little purpose and without any supper too they forgot that part of the ceremonyAnd now I think on't I believe that's what makes me so nervousHunger will tame the courage of a lion  Count  To know that she is here and not to see her  Varbel  Do let's go back and try if we can hinder their seeing that we have broke out of the doghole they lock'd us inConsider he'll be coming to you with his letter presently  Count  Am I deceiv'd That ribbandThis this is
