work the Author hopes will apologize to his Subscribers when laid before them and the acquisition of many valuable materials which greatly enrich the Compilation he flatters himself will compensate the trespass committed on their patience  A short account of the method pursued in this work seems necessary to demonstrate the value of those Manuscripts which have lately been obtained  ATTENTION to the most distant antiquity may appear to the learned Reader not suf∣ficiently engaging to detain him from those Events which are strictly Provincial yet the neglect of a general view of this County in the earliest ages would disappoint others Therefore in the Introduction I shall in a cursory manner pay attention to those times which preceed the accession of the ROMANS and notice the conquest made by them of the Province of BRIGANTIA their departure the calling in of the Saxons and found∣ation of their Monarchy in Northumberland with the succession of Sovereigns in BERNICIA and DEIRA until the union of those States under OSWALD In this peri∣od the state of the Christian Church in the Northern parts of Britain shall be noted and the manners and customs of the people described  THE work opens with the conversion of the Northumbrian Saxons and the found∣ation of the See of LINDISFARNE  IT would be useless to mention the various ancient authors whose labours furnish ma∣terials for this part of the work or to recapitulate the many publications well known to the learned reader which will be critically referred to on every occasion through∣out the whole Soon after the Prelates were settled at LINDISFARNE they appear to have taken a part in the affairs of Government and indeed the situation of Religious Societies was such in the infancy of Church Establishment that on every convulsion of State and revolution of Empire they were in imminent peril so that it becomes indis∣pensibly necessary in carrying on a history of the progress of the See to weave and mingle therewith the material events of State more especially where the Provincial injunctions and ordinances were a mixture of maxims Civil and Clerical If it appears necessary to introduce the affairs of Government in the early stages of our Bishoprick how much more important doth it seem when our Prelates held high Offices under the Crown led forth the troops of their Province were Embassadors making League and Truce and when this Palatinate became a barrier between two hostile Nations and often the scene of battle These are briefly noticed here to account for interweaving so much of the general history with the annals of our Prelates The rehearsal of local Events must be abrupt and material facts unconnected and unpleasant in the relation if not carried on in a short successional line of circumstances for their introduction thereby rendering such Events more interesting to the Reader and by enlarging the limits of Provincial history giving a more pleasing channel to the narrative By this method the reader will also be enabled to collect the traits of character which every Prelate displayed in his public or private Capacity and to read the Man divested of the robes of Pontificacy  IT was not till after the Episcopal seat was at DURHAM that we hear any thing of the Civil Jurisdiction being vested in the Prelates WALCHER whose accession was in the year was the first that wore that Imperial Mitre which in after ages became so distinguished and with the Clerical character mixed the rights and privileges of a Sover∣eign thereby erecting an English Popedom The ambitious BEKE in maintenance of his regal authority within this Province touching forfeited Estates for which he contended with the Crown alledged in Parliament  that the Bishops of Durham had from antient time all regal rights and Jurisdiction within their Royal Liberty of Durham from the time of the Conquest and antecedent thereto  This privilege is founded upon Prescription immemo∣rial because there is no record of its being granted by any Princes before the Conquest or since wherein it is not supposed to have been granted also by their predecessors it proceeded at first from a principle of Devotion to St CUTHBERT that whatever Lands were given to him or bought with his money he should hold them with the same freedom that the Princes who gave them held the rest of their Estates but this pi∣ety to the Saint was not without its prudential purposes all along both for the service  of the Crown in the Wars with Scotland and also for the service of the Country because of its distance from the Courts of Law above  IN the Annals of Bishop WALCHER and his Successors all the evidence obtained by laborious research will be laid down to define of what the PALATINE power consisted in the exercise of its authority and into one point of view will be collected whatever our most learned Writers have said concerning it For as the regal jurisdiction in this Province is alledged to be prescriptive it is from Writers of Antiquity only we can trace the original sense entertained of the authority of a PALATINE and from successional acts coming into ages of learning and research that we can learn the real power of that species of Jurisdiction It was an ancient maxim  Quidquid rex habet extra Commitatem Dunelmensem Episcopus habet infra nisi aliqua sit concessio aut praescriptio in contrarium  THE Bishops had great extent of power as the several Records quoted in the course of the work under each Episcopacy will evince They levied taxes for the defence and service of the Palatinate and made truces with Enemies raised defensible troops within the liberty from sixteen to sixty years of age and impressed Ships for war they sate in judgment of life and death and held execution by life and limb They had power to create Barons who formed their Council or Parliament and with their Vassals were bound to attend the Bishop's summons in time of public exigen∣cy The greatest part of the Lands within the liberty were held of the Bishops as Lords Paramount in Capite They coined money granted licences to embattle Castles build Churches found Hospitals and Chantries instituted Corporations by Charter to which the Crown's assent was not essential to maintain their legality and granted Fairs and Markets They had all manner of Royal Jurisdiction both Civil and Military by Land and by Water for the exercise whereof they held proper Courts and appointed Officers and other Ministers of every department as well such as the Crown nominates without the liberty as those the King had been used to depute according to the exi∣gencies of special cases and for the Execution of Acts of Parliament The Bishops Officers by Patent are the Temporal Chancellor Constable of Durham Castle to whom belonged the care of the Levies the custody of the Armour and pay of the troops the high Chamberlain the under Chamberlain Secretary of State Steward Treasurer Comptroller of the Household Master of the Horse Stewards of the Manors and Hal∣mote Courts Sheriff Prothonotary Clerks of the Chancery Crown and Peace Keeper of the Rolls Cursitor Registers and Examiners in Chancery Clerk of the County Court Stewards of Borough Courts Eschaetors Feodaries Auditors and under Auditors Clerks of the receipt of the Exchequer Supervisors of Lordships Castles Mines of Coal Lead and Iron Coroners Conservators of Ports and Rivers Officers of Marshal∣sea Clerks of Markets Keepers of the great Seal of Ulnage of the Wardrobe and  Harness and Master Armourer They had several Forests Chaces Parks and Woods where they had their Foresters who held Courts in their name and determined mat∣ters relative to Forests Parks Rangers and Palekeepers They were Lord high Admirals of the Sea and Waters that lie within or adjoining the County Palatine had Vice Admi∣rals and Courts of Admiralty Judges to determine according to the Maritime Laws Re∣gisters Examiners Officers of Beaconage Anchorage c and awarded Commissions to regulate Waters and passages thereon  Thus by themselves and Officers they did Justice to all persons in all cases without either the King or any of his Officers inter∣fering ordinarily in any thing Whatever occasion the King had within this liberty his Writs did not run here they were not directed as to his own Officers in other Counties but to the Bishop himself or in the Vacancy of the See to the proper Offi∣cers of the Palatinate When King Henry the II sent his Justices of Assize hither upon an extraordinary occasion of Murders and Robberies he declared by his Char∣ter that he did it with the licence of the Bishop  et pro hac vice tantum  and that it should not be drawn into custom either in his time or in the time of his heirs not being done but upon absolute necessity and that he would nevertheless have the Lands of Saint Cuthbert to enjoy its Liberties and antient Customs as amply as ever  IT was not 'till after WILLIAM DE CARILEPHO's accession to the See in that the regal rights of our Prelates received confirmation in writing from the Crown After the coming in of the NORMANS Deeds and Writings under Seal gained general acceptation and every material transaction was conducted under written muniments Proceeding that aera most of the public Records were only entries  in testimonium  attest∣ed by the parties present as Registers of the fact who thereto subscribed their names under the sign of the Cross and from that important period in our Provincial History the long series of Records to which I shall have occasion to refer will appear  THE Work will consist of  two  Volumes The  first  comprehends the Annals of the Bishops with their several acts of Jurisdiction embellished with many Portraits Seals Coins Arms c  THE  second  comprehends local descriptions with the peculiar history of each part of the County thrown into Parochial divisions The CITY of DURHAM is treated of at large and in progressive order the Charters of Incorporation are inserted particularly the new one granted by the present Bishop In this arrangement of City records is a  fac simile  of Bishop PUDSEY's Charter with the Pope's confirmatory Bull a Plate pre∣sented by Mr G ALLAN and engraved by that incomparable artist  Stephens  by whose death the Author hath lost a great assistant and the public one of the most accurate workmen of the age Under this head lists of the chief Magistrates of the City and Representatives in Parliament will be inserted Great attention is paid to the history  of the Cathedral which is embellished with two correct draughts and admeasurements of the North and East fronts by an eminent Architect employed in the present costly repairs now carrying on and each part thereof and other Monastic buildings descri∣bed with a comparative view of their antient magnificence and present state Short anecdotes of the Priors Deans Prebendaries and other Ministers with historical notes and Monumental Inscriptions will be inserted The Endowment by K Hen VIII will be given at length with the Statutes and other Muniments to which are added a number of Records hitherto withheld from the public In like manner the Author passes through every other public building and place of consequence and throws in Engravings of all the remains of Antiquity Castles and principal Seats some of which have been contributed as an encouragement to the work by the late JOHN CUTHBERT  Esq  JOHN TEMPEST and TIMOTHY HUTCHINSON Esquires MR ALLAN and others  As the Author proceeds in Parochial Divisions he takes for his guide the Book of Rates made for collecting the Royal Aid under the Satutes of and of Charles II Each Parish Church is described and engravings given of the most remarkable due attention is paid to things memorable recorded in the Registers and Monumental In∣scriptions and the supposed value of each Living shewn and the Incumbents in suc∣cession thrown into the notes Under this division every thing remarkable in Anti∣quity or rare in nature is treated of and some of the most singular monuments repre∣sented The foundations and privileges of each religious House Hospital Gild and Chantry are set forth with engravings of all the Seals extant  ALL Gentlemens Seats are described and antient possessors noted with Genealogical Tables not only of the principal Families existing but such as are extinct and were once of consequence in the County together with transcripts of Visitations in the Libra∣ries of JOHN TEMPEST and MARMADUKE TUNSTALL Esquires whose liberality demands every grateful acknowledgment These are compleated by the additions of Mr ALLAN whose indefatigable labour has accumulated most of the materials from which this work is compiled and from whose unexampled bounty and generosity they are sub∣mitted to the author's arrangement for the public Eye  A short account of the STAPLES of this County will be presented its Trade and Manufacturies with the Imports and Exports Comparative tables from the Church Registers for years of the last and present Century are inserted to shew the state of Population communicated by the respective Clergy whose attention hereto has been singularly kind  A cursory view of the NATURAL HISTORY of each district is introduced with de∣lineations of such productions as are curious and a short account of the STRATA found in the Mines with drawings and admeasurements from the works  PROGRESSIVE observations will be made as the Itinerary advances on AGRICULTURE produce of the Lands growth of Timber and breeds of Cattle with other matters equally interesting to the Inhabitants  HAVING given a cursory view of the manner in which this Work will be executed the MATERIALS from whence it is chiefly compiled shall next be noticed and this the Author is more particularly induced to do as since his proposals were offered a publication has appeared from the Clarendon Press intitled  Collectanea Curiosa  taken from the Manuscripts of Archbishop SANCROFT in the  Bodleian  Library wherein is a compendious arrangement of Materials necessary for constructing a work like this  THE first Record noted is the Doomsday Book of this County called BOLDON BUKE from the Survey which it contains having reference in many Lordships to the Manor of  Boldon  touching the services of the Tenants  "sicut in Boldon"  The Editor gives several Extracts which he says were collated with the transcript lodged in the Bodleian Library  See Gough's Anecdotes of British Topography V p  The Original Survey is deposited in the Auditors Office at Durham and bound up with a succeeding Survey made by order of Bishop Hatfield It is wrote on Vellum and thus indorsed "  Supervisus temp Hugonis Epi    et Supervisus temp Thome Hatfeld Epi'  The first is wrote in a compact hand and contained in pages the latter in a looser hand of pages and more comprehensive  IT was not till after Proposals were offered to the public that these Records were obtained and they are introduced through the work as they appertain to the place de∣scribed thereby rendering them less tedious to the Eye and much readier in applica∣tion than in an Appendix This required much labour and attention to execute and necessarily has delayed the Publication  THAT laborious Collector of Records the Rev Mr THOMAS RANDALL late Master of the Grammer School in Durham employed the leisure of his whole life in searching the several Repositories there and I have before me fifteen large Volumes in Manuscript consisting of upwards of pages each copied therefrom with that accuracy for which he was singular  IN the Chapter Treasury and Library it is said there are above ninety Royal Charters and Grants above fifty Deeds by Nobles and Barons about by Gentlemen by Popes Bishops Abbots Priors Convents and other Religious Persons and Hou∣ses and above other Original Deeds and Copies which will amount in all to about In Mr Randall's Collection are Copies of all the Grants Conventions and other Instruments that are curious and entered in the Chartularies of the Chapter not only from his own inspection but gathered from the labours of Dr Hunter and  Mr Gabriel Swainston whose amusements led that way These Volumes also contain extracts from the Copyhold Books of the Bishop copies of a series of the close Rolls of the Chancery minutes of the Visitation Books and Registers of all the Prelates c Also two large folios of the Inquisitions post mortem taken before the Bishop's Sheriffs and Eschaetors within the liberties of Durham and Sadberge and another of the Wills of such Persons as have founded public Charities and other matters equally important to a Work of this kind All this Fund was bequeathed by Mr Randall's Will to Mr Allan and is part of his Collection opened for my use The materials were unarranged and without Index so that tho' the Treasure was great the labour of digesting was infinite  MR SPEARMAN made Collections in an unfortunate dispute with the then Prelate CREWE and published a small tract in quarto intitled "  An Enquiry into the antient and present state of the County Palatine of Durham c  " and therein referred to all such records as he had received information from Those noticed were inspected and notes taken thereof at Bishop CREWE's instance an original Manuscript whereof is dated February mutilated by Spearman's publication but apparently the Manuscript to which he was indebted His other Papers fell into hands disinterested in matters of that kind and as said are lost The late THOMAS GYLL  Esq  of Durham has remarked in writing  that most or all of this Gentleman's Papers came to the hands of  Gilbert Spearman  Esq  who by Will dated October bequeathed them to his Son  George Spearman  and desired that such parts relating to the Coun∣ty Palatine of Durham as were thought proper might be published and earnestly recommended to his Son not to make them his study but his diversion which I am verily persuaded  George  out of filial duty did most religiously observe  and the fact proved so for he suffered them to be wasted and thrown away Tho' the late Mr  Cuthbert  of Witton informed Mr  Allan  that he knew where many of these MSS were and promised to procure them for his use when he got up to London but unfortu∣nately he died on the Road thither  MR MICKLETON's Papers were more fortunate he had made considerable Collec∣tions and Mr Randall laments their imagined loss as he never saw them in these words  Mr Mickleton a Counsellor at Law in Durham had collected some Evidences touching the Palatinate and his Executors sold his Papers to Mr  Gilbert  so that they are lost to the public save what appears in Mr  Spearman's  Book  JOHN RUDD  Esq  of Durham an eminent Counsellor at Law had an inspection there∣of and happily thought them of sufficient importance to make full extracts of every material matter therein and gives the following account thereof  TITULUS  primi Lib

greatest importance to their col∣lections From this channel the Author has received two Volumes of a compleat seri∣es of Extracts from the Cursitors Rolls and in three folios innumerable copies of Char∣ters Grants and other public Instruments together with Mickleton's Collections which it is not doubted will amply apologize for the delays that have hitherto befallen this intended Publication  BREVITTS tho' of no authority in point of evidence yet for information are often useful discovering what suites have formerly depended directing to the Records and often explaining their meaning and giving us the several pleadings and proceedings therein with the best discovery of the merit and mystery of the cause The Attor∣neys or Sollicitors who keep these Brevitts after the Causes are determined are the persons capable of supplying us particularly those of the greatest bufiness they hav∣ing most of them  COLLECTANIA Curiosa V p    By the author's extensive acquaintance with Gentlemen of the Law and other connections he is possessed of several touching boundary Causes and others of the first importance in the County which it might give offence to eminent Characters to name  THE late THOMAS GYLL  Esq  was a skillful Antiquarian had a fine taste in the Belles Lettres and held correspondence with Persons of the first eminence in that walk He made many Collections and Observations touching this County which he commu∣nicated to Mr Allan and are now before me  MR MANN who was Deputy Clerk of the Peace and County Treasurer many years made considerable collections from whose labours given to Mr Allan in his life time  the Author derived the accounts dispersed through the work of public Assessments and Money Charges together with many materials relative to the Church City and Coun∣ty at large  MR RALPH HODGSON an eminent Attorney and Steward to several Prelates had collected many curious matters touching the Bishop's Revenues and Church Lands whose Manuscripts and Papers were also communicated to Mr Allan  Two Manuscript Volumes of the late COUNCELLOR GREY of Newcastle have been kindly lent by MR ABBS of Weremouth from whence great assistance is gained in his∣torical notes and references touching the several Prelates and inferior Clergy hitherto unknown  CONSIDERABLE assistance has likewise been received from Mr ROBERT HARRISON of Durham and Mr JOSEPH RITSON of Grays Inn London whose researches in the Harleian and Cottonian Libraries have furnished several valuable transcripts especially an historical Poem on the Battle of Durham fought October known by the title of the  Battle at Nevill's Cross  which will be inserted at full length  IN a valuable Manuscript communicated by Sir JOHN LAWSON many particulars are recorded of the Riches Rites and Ceremonies of the Church at Durham And in a long Paper Roll about five inches broad written in a clear antient hand communi∣cated by JOHN HOGG  Esq  of Norton is discovered the original perhaps or at least the whole contents of DAVIES'S RITES and from which the th page of the COLLECTANEA CURIOSA is composed  W H MILBOURNE  Esq  of Armathwate Castle in Cumberland JOHN LAWSON MAIRE  Esq  of Lartington in Yorkshire and many other Gentlemen have also favoured me with some Manuscripts from their repective Libraries  THE evidences of several private families have been inspected and every thing interesting to the public carefully extracted  To close this account of my materials I should be unpardonable were I to omit the assistance of my kind friend Mr ALLAN whose Library has been generously laid open to me together with the use of five large Manuscript Volumes of the Parochial history arranged and digested by himself besides innumerable collections from vari∣ous authorities and records with Charters Seals Coins and other Antiquities It is to his bounty that the work will be embellished with many curious and valuable Plates Pedigrees of families c  SUCH Materials like gems in the hand of the jeweller cannot lose their intrinsic value in their present arrangement And if the following work should be considered as little better than a mere repository by means of which a more happy Compiler may display them in a more judicious manner I shall have a secret pleasure in having been the humble and laborious instrument in collecting the Materials of his nobler edifice
