 THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF AN ATOM  IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  LONDON Printed for ROBINSON and ROBERTS N  o  in Paternoster Row MDCCXLIX  ADVERTISEMENT FROM THE PUBLISHER to the READER  IN these ticklish times it may be necessary to give such an account of the following sheets as will exempt me from the plague of prosecution  On the th of March in the present year they were offered to me for sale by a tall thin woman about the age of threescore dressed in a gown of Bombazine with a cloak and bonnet of black silk both a little the worse for the wearShe called  herself Dorothy Hatchet spinster of the parish of Oldstreet administratrix of Mr Nathaniel Peacock who died in the said parish on the fifth day of last April and lies buried in the churchyard of Islington in the northwest corner where his grave is distinguished by a monumental board inscribed with the following tristich  Hic haec hoc  Here lies the block  Of old Nathaniel Peacock  In this particular any person whatever may satisfy himself by taking an afternoon's walk to Islington where at the White House he may recreate and refresh  himself with excellent tea and hot rolls for so small a charge as eightpence  As to the M S before I would treat for it I read it over attentively and found it contained divers curious particulars of a foreign history without any allusion to or resemblance with the transactions of these times I likewise turned over to Kempfer and the Universal History and found in their several accounts of Japan many of the names and much of the matter specified in the following sheets Finally that I might run no risque of misconstruction I had recourse to an eminent chambercouncil of my acquaintance who diligently perused  the whole and declared it was no more actionable than the Vision of Ezekiel or the Lamentations of Jeremiah the prophet Thus assured I purchased the copy which I now present in print with my best respects to the Courteous Reader being his very humble servant  Bucklersbury  S ETHERINGTON  Vivant Rex Regina  THE History and Adventures OF AN ATOM  The EDITOR's Declaration  I Nathaniel Peacock of the parish of St Giles haberdasher and author solemnly declare That on the third of last August sitting alone in my study up three pair of stairs between the hours of eleven and twelve at night meditating upon the uncertainty of sublunary enjoyment I heard a shrill small voice seemingly proceeding from a chink or crevice in my own pericranium call distinctly three times  "Nathaniel Peacock Nathaniel Peacock Nathaniel Peacock"  Astonished yea even affrighted at this citation I replied in a faultering tone  "In the name of the Lord what art thou"  Thus adjured the voice answered and said  "I am an atom"  I was now thrown into a violent perturbation of spirit for I never could behold an atomy without fear and trembling even when I knew it was no more than a composition of dry bones but the conceit of being in presence of an atomy informed with spirit that is animated by a ghost or goblin increased my terrors exceedingly I durst not lift up mine eyes lest I should behold an apparition more dreadful than the handwriting on the wall My knees knocked together my teeth chattered mine hair bristled up so as to raise a cotton nightcap from the scalp my tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth my temples were bedewed with a cold sweatVerily I was for a season entranced  At length by the blessing of God I recollected myself and cried aloud  "Avaunt Satan in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost"  "Whitelivered caitiff  said the voice with a peculiar tartness of pronunciation what art thou afraid of that thou shouldest thus tremble and diffuse around thee such an unsavoury odourWhat thou hearest is within theeis part of thyself I am one of those atoms or constituent particles of matter which can neither be annihilated divided nor impaired the different arrangements of us atoms compose all the variety of objects and essences which nature exhibits or art can obtain Of the same shape substance and quality are the component particles that harden in rock and flow in water that blacken in the negro and brighten in the diamond that exhale from a rose and steam from a dunghill Even now ten millions of atoms were dispersed  in air by that odoriferous gale which the commotion of thy fear produced and I can foresee that one of them will be consolidated in a fibre of the olfactory nerve belonging to a celebrated beauty whose nostril is excoriated by the immoderate use of plain Spanish Know Nathaniel that we atoms are singly endued with such efficacy of reason as cannot be expected in an aggregate body where we croud and squeeze and embarrass one another Yet those ideas which we singly possess we cannot communicate except once in a thousand years and then only when we fill a certain place in the pineal gland of a human creature the very station which I now maintain in thineFor the benefit of you miserable mortals I am determined to promulge the history of one period during which I underwent some strange revolutions in the empire of Japan and was conscious of some political anecdotes now to be divulged  for the instruction of British ministers Take up the pen therefore and write what I shall unfold  By this time my first apprehension vanished but another fear almost as terrible usurped its place I began to think myself insane and concluded that the voice was no other than the fantastic undulation of a disturbed brain I therefore preferred an earnest orison at the throne of grace that I might be restored to the fruition of my right understanding and judgment  "O incredulous wretch exclaimed the voice I will now convince thee that this is no phantasma or hideous dreamAnswer me dost thou know the meaning and derivation of the word atom"  I replied  "No verily"  "Then I will tell thee said the voice thou shalt write it down without delay and consult the curate of the parish on the same subject If his explanation and mine agree thou will then be firmly persuaded  that I am an actual independent existence and that this address is not the vague delirium of a disordered brain  Atomos  is a Greek word signifying an indivisible particle derived from  alpha  privativa and  temno  to cut"  I marvelled much at this injunction which however I literally obeyed and next morning sallied forth to visit the habitation of the curate but in going thither it was my hap to encounter a learned physician of my acquaintance who hath read all the books that ever were published in any nation or language to him I refered for the derivation of the word atom He paused a little threw up his eyes to heaven stroaked his chin with great solemnity and hemming three times  "Greek Sir said he is more familiar to me than my native tongueI have conversed Sir with Homer and Plato Hesiod and Theophrastus Herodotus Thucydides  Hippocrates Aretaeus Pindar and Sophocles and all the poets and historians of antiquity Sir my library cost me two thousand pounds I have spent as much more in making experiments and you must know that I have discovered certain chemical specifics which I would not divulge for fifty times the sumAs for the word  atomos  or  atime  it signifies a scoundrel Sir or as it were Sir a thing of no estimation It is derived Sir from  alpha  privativa and  time  honour Hence we call a skeleton an atomy because Sir the bones are as it were dishonoured by being stripped of their cloathing and exposed in their nakedness"  I was sorely vexed at this interpretation and my apprehension of lunacy recurred nevertheless I proceeded in my way to the lodgings of the curate and desired his explanation which tallied exactly with what I had written At my return to my  own house I ascended to my study asked pardon of my internal monitor and taking pen ink and paper sat down to write what it dictated in the following strain  "It was in the aera of  The history of Japan is divided into three different aeras of which Foggien is the most considerable  Foggien one thousand years ago that fate determined I should exist in the empire of Japan where I underwent a great number of vicissitudes till at length I was enclosed in a grain of rice eaten by a Dutch mariner at Firando and becoming a particle of his body brought to the Cape of Good Hope There I was discharged in a scorbutic dysentery taken up in a heap of soil to manure a garden raised to vegetation in a sallad devoured by an English supercargo assimilated to a certain organ of his body which at his return to London being diseased in consequence of impure contact I  was again separated with a considerable portion of putrefied flesh thrown upon a dunghill gobbled up and digested by a duck of which duck your father Ephraim Peacock having eaten plentifully at a feast of the cordwainers I was mixed with his circulating juices and finally fixed in the principal part of that animalcule which in process of time expanded itself into thee Nathaniel Peacock  Having thus particularized my transmigrations since my conveyance from Japan I shall return thither and unfold some curious particulars of stateintrigue carried on during the short period the history of which I mean to record I need not tell thee that the empire of Japan consists of three large islands or that the people who inhabit them are such inconsistent capricious animals that one would imagine they were created for the purpose of ridicule Their minds are in continual agitation like a shuttlecock  tossed to and fro in order to divert the demons of philosophy and folly A Japonese without the intervention of any visible motive is by turns merry and pensive superficial and profound generous and illiberal rash and circumspect courageous and fearful benevolent and cruel They seem to have no fixed principle of action no certain plan of conduct no effectual rudder to steer them through the voyage of life but to be hurried down the rapid tide of each revolving whim or driven the sport of every gust of passion that happens to blow A Japonese will sing at a funeral and sigh at a wedding he will this hour talk ribaldry with a prostitute and the next immerse himself in the study of metaphysics or theology In favour of one stranger he will exert all the virtues of hospitality against another he will exercise all the animosity of the most sordid prejudice one minute sees him  hazarding his all on the success of the most extravagant project another beholds him hesitating in lending a few copans  Copan is a gold coin used in Japan value about shillings  to his friend on undeniable security Today he is afraid of paring his corns tomorrow he scruples not to cut his own throat At one season he will give half his fortune to the poor at another he will not bestow the smallest pittance to save his brother from indigence and distress He is elated to insolence by the least gleam of success he is dejected to despondence by the slightest turn of adverse fortune One hour he doubts the best established truths the next he swallows the mostimprobable fiction His praise and his censure is what a wise man would choose to avoid as evils equally pernicious the first is generally raised without foundation and carried to such extravagance as to expose the  object to the ridicule of mankind the last is often unprovoked yet usually inflamed to all the rage of the most malignant persecution He will extol above Alexander the great a petty officer who robs a henroost and damn to infamy a general for not performing impossibilities The same man whom he yesterday flattered with the most fulsome adulation he will tomorrow revile with the most bitter abuse and at the turning of a straw take into his bosom the very person whom he has formerly defamed as the most perfidious rascal  The Japanese value themselves much upon their constitution and are very clamorous about the words liberty and property yet in fact the only liberty they enjoy is to get drunk whenever they please to revile the government and quarrel with one another With respect to their property they are the tamest animals in the world and if properly managed  undergo without wincing such impositions as no other nation in the world would bear In this particular they may be compared to an ass that will crouch under the most unconscionable burthen provided you scratch his long ears and allow him to bray his bellyfull They are so practicable that they have suffered their pockets to be drained their veins to be emptied and their credit to be cracked by the most bungling administrations to gratify the avarice pride and ambition of the most sordid and contemptible sovereigns that ever sate upon the throne  The methods used for accomplishing these purposes are extremely simple You have seen a dancing bear incensed to a dangerous degree of rage and all at once appeased by firing a pistol over his nose The Japonese even in their most ferocious moods when they denounce vengeance against the Cuboy or minister and even  threaten the throne itself are easily softened into meekness and condescension A set of tall fellows hired for the purpose tickle them under the noses with long straws into a gentle convulsion during which they shut their eyes and smile and quietly suffer their pockets to be turned inside out Nay what is still more remarkable the ministry is in possession of a pipe or rather bullocks's horn which being sounded to a particular pitch has such an effect on the ears and understanding of the people that they allow their pockets to be picked with their eyes open and are bribed to betray their own interest with their own money as easily as if the treasure had come from the remotest corner of the globe Notwithstanding these capricious peculiarities the Japonese are become a wealthy and powerful people partly from their insular situation and partly from a spirit of commercial adventure sustained by  all the obstinacy of perseverance and conducted by repeated flashes of good sense which almost incessantly gleam through the chaos of their absurdities  Japan was originally governed by monarchs who possessed an absolute power and succeeded by hereditary right under the title of Dairo But in the beginning of the period Foggien this emperor became a cypher and the whole administration devolved into the hands of the prime minister or Cuboy who now exercises all the power and authority leaving the trappings of royalty to the inactive Dairo The prince who held the reins of government in the short period which I intend to record was not a lineal descendant of the antient Dairos the immediate succession having sailed but sprung from a collateral branch which was invited from a foreign country in the person of  Bupo  in honour of whom the Japonese erected Fakkubasi  Vid Kempfer Lib i  or the  temple of the white horse So much were all his successors devoted to the culture of this idol which by the bye was made of the vilest materials that in order to enrich his shrine they impoverished the whole empire yet still with the connivance and by the influence of the Cuboy who gratified this sordid passion or superstition of the Dairo with a view to prevent him from employing his attention on matters of greater consequence  Nathaniel You have heard of the transmigration of souls a doctrine avowed by one Pythagoras a philosopher of Crotona This doctrine though discarded and reprobated by christians is nevertheless sound and orthodox I affirm on the integrity of an atom Further I shall not explain myself on this subject though I might with safety set the convocation and the whole hierarchy at defiance knowing as I do that it is not in their  power to make me bate one particle of what I advance or if they should endeavour to reach me through your organs and even condemn you to the stake at Smithfield verily I say unto thee I should be a gainer by the next remove I should shift my quarters from a very cold and empty tenement which I now occupy in the brain of a poor haberdasher to the nervous plexus situated at the mouth of the stomach of a fat aldermand fed with venison and turtle  But to return to Pythagoras whom one of your wise countrymen denominated  Peter Gore the wiseacre  of Croton you must know that philosopher was a type which hath not yet been fully unveiled That he taught the metempsychosis explained the nature and property of harmonies demonstrated the motion of the earth discovered the elements of geometry and arithmetic enjoined his disciples silence and abstained from eating  any thing that was ever informed by the breath of life are circumstances known to all the learned world but his veneration for beans which cost him his life his golden thigh his adventures in the character of a courtezan his golden verses his epithet of  the fable of his being born of a virgin and his descent into hell are mysteries in which some of the most important truths are concealedBetween friends honest Nathaniel I myself constituted part of that sage's body and I could say a great dealbut there is a time for all thingsI shall only observe that Philip Tessier had some reason for supposing Pythagoras to have been a monk and there are shrewd hints in Meyer's dissertation  Utrum Pythagoras Judaeus fuit an monachus Carmelita  Waving these intricate discussions for the present though I cannot help disclosing that Pythagoras was actually  circumcised know Peacock that the metempsychosis or transmigration of souls is the method which nature and fate constantly pursue in animating the creatures produced on the face of the earth and this process with some variation is such as the eleusinian mysteries imported and such as you have read in Dryden's translation of the sixth book of Virgil's Aeneid The Gods have provided a great magazine or diversorium to which the departed souls of all animals repair at their dismission from the body Here they are bathed in the waters of oblivion until they retain no memory of the scenes through which they have passed but they still preserve their original crasis and capacity From this repository all new created beings are supplied with souls and these souls transmigrate into different animals according to the pleasure of the great disposer For example my good friend Nathaniel Peacock your  own soul has within these hundred years threaded a goat a spider and a bishop and its next stage will be the carcase of a brewer's horse  In what manner we atoms come by these articles of intelligence whether by intuition or communication of ideas it is not necessary that you should conceiveSuffice it to say the gods were merry on the follies of mankind and Mercury undertook to exhibit a mighty nation ruled and governed by the meanest intellects that could be found in the repository of preexisting spirits He laid the scene in Japan about the middle of the period Foggien when that nation was at peace with all her neighbours Into the mass destined to sway the sceptre he infused at the very article of conception the spirit which in course of strangulation had been expelled  a posteriori  from a goose killed on purpose to regale the appetite of the mother The animalcule thus inspired was  born and succeeded to the throne under the name of Gothamababa His whole life and conversation was no other than a repetition of the humours he had displayed in his last character He was rapacious shallow hotheaded and perverse in point of understanding just sufficient to appear in public without a siavering bib imbued with no knowledge illumed by no sentiment and warmed with no affection except a blind attachment to the worship of Fakkubasi which seemed indeed to be a disease in his constitution His heart was meanly selfish and his disposition altogether unprincely  Of all his recreations that which he delighted in most was kicking the breech of his Cuboy or prime minister an exercise which he every day performed in private It was therefore necessary that a Cuboy should be found to undergo this diurnal operation without repining This was a circumstance  foreseen and provided for by Mercury who a little after the conception of Gothamababa impregnated the ovum of a future Cuboy and implanted in it a changling soul which had successively passed through the bodies of an ass a dottril an applewoman and a cowboy It was diverting enough to see the rejoicings with which the birth of this Quanbuku  Quanbuku is a dignity of the first order in Japan  was celebrated and still more so to observe the marks of fond admiration in the parents as the soul of the cowboy proceeded to expand itself in the young Cuboy This is a species of diversion we atoms often enjoy We at different times behold the same spirit hunted down in a hare and cried up in an Hector fawning in a prostitute and bribing in a minister breaking forth in a whistle at the plough and in a sermon from the pulpit impelling a hog to  the stye and a counsellor to the cabinet prompting a shoeboy to filch and a patriot to harangue squinting in a goat and smiling in a matron  Tutors of all sorts were provided betimes for the young Quanbuku but his genius rejected all cultivation at least the crops it produced were barren and ungrateful He was distinguished by the name of Fikakaka and caressed as the heir of an immense fortune Nay he was really considered as one of the most hopeful young Quanbukus in the empire of Japan for his want of ideas was attended with a total absence of pride insolence or any other disagreeable vice indeed his character was founded upon negatives He had no understanding no oeconomy no courage no industry no steadiness no discernment no vigour no retention He was reputed generous and goodhumoured but was really profuse chickenhearted negligent fickle  blundering weak and leaky All these qualifications were agitated by an eagerness haste and impatience that compleated the most ludicrous composition which human nature ever produced He appeared always in hurry and confusion as if he had lost his wits in the morning and was in quest of them all dayLet me whisper a secret to you my good friend Peacock All this bustle and trepidation proceeded from a hollowness in the brain forming a kind of eddy in which his animal spirits were hurried about in a perpetual swirl Had it not been for this  Lusus Naturoe  the circulation would not have been sufficient for the purposes of animal life Had the whole world been searched by the princes thereof it would not have produced another to have matched this halfwitted original to whom the administration of a mighty empire was wholly consigned Notwithstanding all the care that was  taken of his education Fikakaka never could comprehend any art or science except that of dancing bareheaded among the Bonzas at the great festival of Cambadoxi The extent of his knowledge in arithmetic went no farther than the numeration of his ten fingers In history he had no idea of what preceded a certain treaty with the Chinese in the reign of queen Syko who died within his own remembrance and was so ignorant of geography that he did not know that his native country was surrounded by the sea No system of morality could he ever understand and of the fourteen sects of religion that are permitted in Japan the only discipline he could imbibe was a superstitious devotion for Fakkubasi the temple of the white horse This indeed was neither the fruit of doctrine nor the result of reason but a real instinct implanted in his nature  for fulfilling the ends of providence His person was extremely aukward his eye vacant though alarmed his speech thick and embarrassed his utterance ungraceful and his meaning perplexed With much difficulty he learned to write his own name and that of the Dairo and picked up a smattering of the Chinese language which was sometimes used at court In his youth he freely conversed with women but as he advanced in age he placed his chief felicity in the delights of the table He hired cooks from China at an enormous expence and drank huge quantities of the strong liquor distilled from rice which by producing repeated intoxication had an unlucky effect upon his brain that was naturally of a loose flimsy texture The immoderate use of this potation was likewise said to have greatly impaired his retentive faculty inasmuch as he was subject upon every  extraordinary emotion of spirit to an involuntary discharge from the last of the intestines  Such was the character of Fikakaka entitled by his birth to a prodigious estate as well as to the honours of Quanbuku the first hereditary dignity in the empire In consequence of his high station he was connected with all the great men in Japan and used to the court from his infancy Here it was he became acquainted with young Gothamababa his future sovereign and their souls being congenial they soon contracted an intimacy which endured for life They were like twin particles of matter which having been divorced from one another by a most violent shock had floated many thousand years in the ocean of the universe till at length meeting by accident and approaching within the spheres of each other's attraction they rush together with an  eager embrace and continue united ever after  The favour of the sovereign added to the natural influence arising from a vast fortune and great alliances did not fail to elevate Fikakaka to the most eminent offices of the state until at length he attained to the dignity of Cuboy or chiefminister which virtually comprehends all the rest Here then was the strangest phaenomenon that ever appeared in the political world A statesman without capacity or the smallest tincture of human learning a secretary who could not write a financier who did not understand the multiplication table and the treasurer of a vast empire who never could balance accounts with his own butler  He was no sooner for the diversion of the Gods promoted to the Cuboyship than his vanity was pampered with all sorts of adulation He was  in magnificence extolled above the first Meckaddo or line of emperors to whom divine honours had been paid equal in wisdom to Tensiodaisin the first founder of the Japanese monarchy braver than Wheyvang of the dynasty of Chew more learned than Jacko the chief pontiff of Japan more liberal than Shiwangti who was possessed of the universal medicine and more religious than  Bupo  alias  Kobot  who from a foreign country brought with him on a white horse a book called Kio containing the mysteries of his religion  But by none was he more cultivated than by the Bonzas or clergy especially those of the university Frenoxena  Vid Hist Eccles Japan Vol I  so renowned for their learning sermons and oratory who actually chose him their supreme director and every morning adored him with a very singular rite of worship This attachment was the more remarkable as  Fikakaha was known to favour the sect of Nembudsju who distinguished themselves by the ceremony of circumcision Some malicious people did not scruple to whisper about that he himself had privately undergone the operation but these to my certain knowledge were the suggestions of falshood and slander A slight scarification indeed it was once necessary to make on account of his health but this was no ceremony of any religious worship The truth was this The Nembudsju being few in number and generally hated by the whole nation had recourse to the protection of Fikakaka which they obtained for a valuable consideration Then a law was promulgated in their favour a step which was so far from exciting the jealousy of the Bonzas that there was not above three out of one hundred and fiftynine thousand that opened their lips in disapprobation of the measure Such were the virtue  and moderation of the Bonzas and so loth were they to disoblige their great director Fikakaka  What rendered the knot of connection between the Dairo Gothamababa and this Cuboy altogether indissoluble was a singular circumstance which I shall now explain Fikakika not only devoted himself intirely to the gratification of his master's prejudices and rapacity even when they interfered the most with the interest and reputation of Japan but he also submitted personally to his capricious humours with the most placid resignation He presented his posteriors to be kicked as regularly as the day revolved and presented them not barely with submission but with all the appearance of fond desire and truly this diurnal exposure was attended with such delectation as he never enjoyed in any other attitude  To explain this matter I must tell thee Peacock that Fikakaka was from his infancy afflicted with an itching of the podex which the learned Dr Woodward would have termed  immanis  pruritus  That great naturalist would have imputed it to a redundancy of cholicky salts got out of the stomach and guts into the blood and thrown upon these parts and he would have attempted to break their colluctations with oil c but I who know the real causes of this disorder smile at these whims of philosophy  Be that as it may certain it is all the most eminent physicians in Japan were consulted about this strange tickling and tingling and among these the celebrated Fansey whose spirit afterwards informed the body of Rabelais This experienced leech having prescribed a course of cathartics balsamics and sweeteners on the supposition that the blood was  tainted with a scorbutical itch at length found reason to believe that the disease was local He therefore tried the method of gentle friction for which purpose he used almost the very same substances which were many centuries after applied by Gargantua to his own posteriors such as a night cap a pillowbier a slipper a poke a pannier a beaver a hen a cock a chicken a calfskin a hareskin a pigeon a cormorant a lawyer's bag a lamprey a coif a lure nay even a goose's neck without finding that  volupté merifique au trou de cul  which was the portion of the son of Grangousier In short there was nothing that gave Fikakaka such respite from this tormenting titillation as did smearing the parts with thick cream which was afterwards licked up by the rough tongue of a boarcat But the administration of this remedy was once productive of a disagreeable incident In the mean  time the distemper gaining ground became so troublesome that the unfortunate Quanbuku was incessantly in the fidgets and ran about distracted cackling like a hen in labour  The source of all this misfortune was the juxta position of two atoms quarrelling for precedency in this the Cuboy's seat of honour Their pressing and squeezing and elbowing and jostling tho' of no effect in discomposing one another occasioned all this irritation and titillation in the posteriors of FikakakaWhat dost thou mutter Peacock dost thou presume to question my veracity now by the indivisible rotundity of an atom I have a good mind caitiff to raise such a buzzing commotion in thy glandula pinealis that thou shalt run distracted over the face of the earth like Io when she was stung by Juno's gadfly What thou who hast been wrapt from the cradle in visions of mystery and revelation swallowed  impossibilities like lamb's wool and digested doctrines harder than iron three times quenched in the Ebro thou to demur at what I assert upon the evidence and faith of my own consciousness and consistencyOh you capitulate well then beware of a relapseyou know a relapsed heretic finds no mercy  I say while Fikakaka's podex was the scene of contention between two turbulent atoms I had the honour to be posted immediately under the nail of the Dairo's great toe which happened one day to itch more than usual for occupation The Cuboy presenting himself at that instant and turning his face from his master Gothamababa performed the exercise with such uncommon vehemence that first his slipper and then his toenail flew off after having made a small breach in the perineum of Fikakaka By the same effort I was divorced from the great  toe of the sovereign and lodged near the great gut of his minister exactly in the interstice between the two hostile particles which were thus in some measure restrained from wrangling though it was not in my power to keep the peace entirely Nevertheless Fikakaka's torture was immediately suspended and he was even seized with an orgasm of pleasure analogous to that which characterises the extacy of love  Think not however Peacock that I would adduce this circumstance as a proof that pleasure and pain are meer relations which can exist only as they are contrasted No pleasure and pain are simple independent ideas incapable of definition and this which Fikakaka felt was an extacy compounded of positive pleasure ingrasted upon the removal of pain but whether this positive pleasure depended upon a particular center of percussion hit  upon by accident or was the inseparable effect of a kicking and scratching conferred by a royal foot and toe I shall not at present unfold neither will I demonstrate the  modus operandi  on the nervous papillae of Fikakaka's breech whether by irritation relaxation undulation or vibration Were these essential discoveries communicated human philosophy would become too arrogant It was but the other day that Newton made shift to dive into some subaltern laws of matter to explain the revolution of the planets and analyse the composition of light and ever since that reptile man has believed itself a demigodI hope to see the day when the petulant philosopher shall be driven back to his Categories and the Organum Universale of Aristotle his  his  and his    But waving these digressions the pleasure which the Cuboy felt from the application of the Dairo's toenail  was succeeded by a kind of tension or stiffness which began to grow troublesome just as he reached his own palace where the Bonzas were assembled to offer up their diurnal incense Instinct on this occasion performed what could hardly have been expected from the most extraordinary talents At sight of a grizzled heard belonging to one of those venerable doctors he was struck with the idea of a powerful assuager and taking him into his cabinet proposed that he should make oral application to the part affected The proposal was embraced without hesitation and the effect even transcended the hope of the Cuboy The osculation itself was soft warm emollient and comfortable but when the nervous papillae were gently stroaked and as it were fondled by the long elastic peristaltic abstersive fibres that composed this reverend verriculum such a delectable titillation ensued that Fikaka was quite in raptures  That which he intended at first for a medicine he now converted into an article of luxury All the Bonzas who enrolled themselves in the number of his dependants whether old or young black or fair rough or smooth were enjoined every day to perform this additional and posterior rite of worship so productive of delight to the Cuboy that he was every morning impatient to receive the Dairo's calcitration or rather his pedestrian digitation after which he flew with all the eagerness of desire to the subsequent part of his entertainment  The transports thus produced seemed to disarrange his whole nervous system and produce an odd kind of revolution in his fancy for tho' he was naturally grave and indeed overwhelmed with constitutional hebetude he became in consequence of this periodical tickling the most giddy pert buffoon in nature All was grinning  giggling laughing and prating except when his fears intervened then he started and stared and cursed and prayed by turns There was but one barber in the whole empire that would undertake to shave him so ticklish and unsteady he was under the hands of the operator He could not fit above one minute in the same attitude or on the same seat but shifted about from couch to chair from chair to stool from stool to closestool with incessant rotation and all the time gave audience to those who sollicited his favour and protection To all and several he promised his best offices and confirmed these promises with oaths and protestations One he shook by the hand another he hugged a third he kissed on both sides the face with a fourth he whispered a fifth he honoured with a familiar horselaugh He never had courage to refuse even that which he could not possibly  grant and at last his tongue actually forgot how to pronounce the negative particle but as in the English language two nagatives amount to an affirmative five hundred affirmatives in the mouth of Fikakaka did not altogether destroy the efficacy of simple negation A promise five hundred times repeated and at every repetition confirmed by oath barely amounted to a computable chance of performance  It must be allowed however he promoted a great number of Bonzas and in this promotion he manifested an uncommon taste They were preferred according to the colour of their beards He found by experience that beards of different colours yielded him different degrees of pleasure in the friction we have described above and the provision he made for each was in proportion to the satisfaction the candidate could afford The sensation ensuing from the contact of a  grey beard was soft and delicate and agreeably demulcent when the parts were unusually inflamed a red yellow or brindled beard was in request when the business was to thrill or tingle but a black beard was of all others the most honoured by Fikakaka not only on account of its fleecy feel equally spirited and balsamic but also for another philosophical reason which I shall now explain You know Peacock that black colour absorbs the rays of light and detains them as it were in a repository Thus a black beard like the back of a black cat becomes a phosphorus in the dark and emits sparkles upon friction You must know that one of the gravest doctors of the Bonzas who had a private request to make desired an audience of Fikakaka in his closet at night and the taper falling down by accident at that very instant when his beard was in contact with the Cuboy's  seat of honour the electrical snap was heard and the part illuminated to the astonishment of the spectators who looked upon it as a prelude to the apotheosis of Fikakaka Being made acquainted with this phaenomenon the minister was exceedingly elevated in his own mind He rejoiced in it as a communication of some divine efficacy and raised the happy Bonza to the rank of Pontifex Maximus or chief priest in the temple of Fakkubasi In the course of experiments he found that all black beards were electrical in the same degree and being ignorant of philosophy ascribed it to some supernatural virtue in consequence of which they were promoted as the holiest of the Bonzas But you and I know that such a phosphorus is obtained from the most worthless and corrupted materials such as rotten wood putrefied veal and stinking whiting  Fikakaka such as I described him could not possibly act in the character of Cuboy without the assistance of counsellors and subalterns who understood the detail of government and the forms of business He was accordingly surrounded by a number of satellites who reflected his lustre in their several spheres of rotation and though their immersions and emersions were apparently abrubt and irregular formed a kind of luminous belt as pale and comfortless as the ring of Saturn the most distant cold and baleful of all the planets  The most remarkable of these subordinates was Stiphirumpoo a man who from a low plebeian origin had raised himself to one of the first offices of the empire to the dignity of  Quo  or nobleman and a considerable share of the Dairo's personal regard He owed his whole success to his industry assiduity and circumspection  During the former part of his life he studied the laws of Japan with such severity of application that though unassisted by the least gleam of genius and destitute of the smallest pretension to talent he made himself master of all the written ordinances all the established customs and forms of proceeding in the different tribunals of the empire In the progress of his vocation he became an advocate of some eminence and even acquired reputation for polemical eloquence though his manner was ever dry laboured and unpleasantBeing elevated to the station of a judge he so far justified the interest by which he had been promoted that his honesty was never called in question and his sentences were generally allowed to be just and upright He heard causes with the most painful attention seemed to be indefatigable in his researches after truth and though he was forbidding in his aspect slow  in deliberation tedious in discussion and cold in his address yet I must own he was also unbiassed in his decisionsI mean unbiassed by any consciousness of sinister motive for a man may be biassed by the nature of his disposition as well as by prejudices acquired and yet not guilty of intentional partiality Stiphirumpoo was scrupulously just according to his own ideas of justice and consequently well qualified to decide in common controversies But in delicate cases which required an uncommon share of penetration when the province of a supreme judge is to mitigate the severity and sometimes even deviate from the dead letter of the common law in favour of particular institutions or of humanity in general he had neither genius to enlighten his understanding sentiment to elevate his mind nor courage to surmount the petty inclosures of ordinary practice He was accused of avarice and cruelty but in  fact these were not active passions in his heart The conduct which seemed to justify these imputations was wholly owing to a total want of taste and generosity The nature of his post furnished him with opportunities to accumulate riches and as the narrowness of his mind admitted no ideas of elegance or refined pleasure he knew not how to use his wealth so as to avoid the charge of a sordid disposition His temper was not rapacious but retentive he knew not the use of wealth and therefore did not use it at all but was in this particular neither better nor worse than a strongbox for the convenience and advantage of his heir The appearance of cruelty remarkable in his counsels relating to some wretched insurgents who had been taken in open rebellion and the rancorous pleasure he seemed to feel in pronouncing sentence of death by self  exenteration  A gentleman capitally convicted in Japan is allowed the privilege of anticipating the common executioner by ripping out his own bowels  was in fact the gratification of a dastardly heart which had never acknowledged the least impulse of any liberal sentiment This being the case mankind ought not to impute that to his guilt which was in effect the consequence of his infirmity A man might with equal justice be punished for being purblind Stiphirumpoo was much more culpable for seeking to shine in a sphere for which nature never intended him I mean for commencing statesman and intermeddling in the machine of government yet even into this character he was forced as it were by the opinion and injunctions of Fikakaka who employed him at first in making speeches for the Dairo which that prince used to pronounce in public at certain  seasons of the year These speeches being tolerably well received by the populace the Cuboy conceived an extraordinary opinion of his talents and thought him extremely well qualified to ease him of great part of the burthen of government He found him very well disposed to engage heartily in his interests Then he was admitted to the osculation  a posteriori  and though his beard was not black but rather of a subfuscan hue he managed it with such dexterity that Fikakaka declared the salute gave him unspeakable pleasure while the bystanders protested that the contact produced not simply electrical sparks or scintillations but even a perfect irradiation which seemed altogether supernatural From this moment Stiphirumpoo was initiated in the mysteries of the cabinet and even introduced to the person of the Dairo Gothamababa whose pedestrian favours  he shared with his new patron It was observed however that even after his promotion and nobilitation he still retained his original aukwardness and never could acquire that graceful ease of attitude with which the Cuboy presented his parts averse to the contemplation of his sovereign Indeed this minister's body was so well moulded for the celebration of the rite that one would have imagined nature had formed him expressly for that purpose with his head and body projecting forwards so as to form an angle of fortyfive with the horizon while the glutaei muscles swelled backwards as if ambitious to meet halfway the imperial encounter  The third connexion that strengthened this political band was Ninkompoopo commander of the  Fune  or navy of Japan who if ever man was might surely be termed the child of fortune He was bred  to the sea from his infancy and in the course of pacific service rose to the command of a jonkh when he was so lucky as to detect a crew of pyrates employed on a desolate shore in concealing a hoard of money which they had taken from the merchants of Corea Ninkompoopo falling in with them at night attacked them unawares and having obtained an easy victory carried off the treasure I cannot help being amused at the folly of you silly mortals when I recollect the transports of the people at the return of this fortunate officer with a paultry mass of silver parading in covered waggons escorted by his crew in arms The whole city of Meaco resounded with acclamation and Ninkompoopo was extolled as the greatest hero that ever the empire of Japan produced The Cuboy honoured him with five kisses in public accepted of the osculation in private recommended him in the strongest  terms to the Dairo who promoted him to the rank of Seyseogun or general at sea He professed himself an adherent to the Cuboy entered into a strict alliance with Stiphirumpoo and the whole management of the  Fune  was consigned into his hands With respect to his understanding it was just sufficient to comprehend the duties of a common mariner and to follow the ordinary route of the most sordid avarice As to his heart he might be said to be in a state of total apathy without principle or passion for I cannot afford the name of passion to such a vile appetite as an insatiable thirst of lucre He was indeed so cold and forbidding that in Japan the people distinguished him by a nickname equivalent to the English word Salamander not that he was inclined to live in fire but that the coldness of his heart would have extinguished any fire it had approached  Some individuals imagined he had been begot upon a mermaid by a sailor of Kamschatka but this was a mere fableI can assure you however that when his lips were in contact with the Cuboy's posteriors Fikakaka's teeth were seen to chatter The pride of this animal was equal to his frigidity He affected to establish new regulations at the council where he presided he treated his equals with insolence and his superiors with contempt Other people generally rejoice in obliging their fellowcreatures when they can do it without prejudice to their own interest Ninkompoopo had a repulsive power in his disposition and seemed to take pleasure in denying a request When this vain creature selfish inelegant arrogant and uncouth appeared in all his trappings at the Dairo's court upon a festival he might have been justly compared to a Lapland idol of ice adornedw th  a profusion of brass leaf and trinkets of pewter In the direction of the Fune he was provided with a certain number of assessors counsellors or coadjutors but these he never consulted more than if they had been wooden images He distributed his commands among his own dependants and left all the forms of the office to the care of the scribe who thus became so necessary that his influence sometimes had well nigh interfered with that of the president nay they have been seen like the electrical spheres of two bodies repelling each other Hence it was observed that the office of the Seyseogunsialty resembled the serpent called Amphisbaena which contrary to the formation of other animals in head and tail has a head where the tail should be Well indeed might they compare them to a serpent in creeping cunning coldness and venom but the comparison would  have held with more propriety had Nature produced a serpent without ever a head at all  The fourth who contributed his credit and capacity to this coalition was FoksiRoku a man who greatly surpassed them all in the science of politicks bold subtle interested insinuating ambitious and indefatigable An adventurer from his cradle a latitudinarian in principle a libertine in morals without the advantages of birth fortune character or interest by his own natural sagacity a close attention to the follies and foibles of mankind a projecting spirit an invincible assurance and an obstinacy of perseverance proof against all the shocks of disappointment and repulse he forced himself as it were into the scale of preferment and being found equally capable and compliant rose to high offices of trust and profit detested by the people as one of the most desperate  tools of a wicked administration and odious to his colleagues in the my for his superior talents his restless ambition and the uncertainty of his attachment  As interest prompted him he hovered between the triumvirate we have described and another knot of competitors for the adn headed by Quambacundono a great Quo related to the Dairo who had bore the supreme command in the army and was stiled Fatzman  Vid Kempfer Amaenitat Japan    or by way of eminence This accomplished prince was not only the greatest in his mind but also the largest in his person of all the subjects of Japan and whereas your Shakespeare makes Falstaff urge it as a plea in his own favour that as he had more flesh so likewise he had more frailty than other men I may justly convert the proposition in favour of Quambacundono and affirm  that as he had more flesh so he had more virtue than any other Japonese more bowels more humanity more beneficence more affability He was undoubtedly for a Fatzman the most courteous the most gallant the most elegant generous and munificent Quo that ever adorned the court of Japan So consummate in the art of war that the whole world could not produce a general to match him in foresight vigilance conduct and ability Indeed his intellects were so extraordinary and extensive that he seemed of sentimentize at every pore and to have the faculty of thinking disfused all over his frame even to his fingers ends or as the Latins call it  ad unguem  nay so wonderful was his organical conformation that in the opinion of many Japonese philosophers his whole body was enveloped in a kind of poultice of brain and that if he had lost his head in battle  the damage with regard to his power of reflection would have been scarce perceptible After he had atchieved many glorious exploits in a war against the Chinese on the continent he was sent with a strong army to quell a dangerous insurrection in the northern parts of Ximo which is one of the Japonese islands He accordingly by his valour crushed the rebellion and afterwards by dint of clemency and discretion extinguished the last embers of disaffection When the insurgents were defeated dispersed and disarmed and a sufficient number selected for example his humanity emerged and took full possession of his breast He considered them as wretched men misled by false principles of honour and sympathized with their distress he pitied them as men and fellowcitizens he regarded them as useful fellowsubjects who might be reclaimed and reunited to the community  Instead of sending out the ministers of blood rapine and revenge to ravage burn and destroy without distinction of age sex or principle he extended the arms of mercy to all who would embrace that indulgence he protected the lives and habitations of the helpless and diminished the number of the malcontents much more effectually by his benevolence than by his sword  The southern Japonese had been terribly alarmed at this insurrection and in the first transports of their deliverance voluntarily taxed themselves with a considerable yearly tribute to the hero Quambacundono In all probability they would not have appeared so grateful had they stayed to see the effects of his merciful disposition towards the vanquished rebels for mercy is surely no attribute of the Japonese considered as a people Indeed nothing could form a more striking contrast  than appeared in the transactions in the northern and southern parts of the empire at this juncture While the amiable Quambacundono was employed in the godlike office of gathering together and cherishing under his wings the poor dispersed forlorn widows and orphans whom the savage hand of war had deprived of parent husband home and sustenance while he in the North gathered these miserable creatures even as a hen gathereth her chickens Stiphirumpoo and other judges in the South were condemning such of their parents and husbands as survived the sword to crucifixion cauldrons of boiling oil or exenteration and the people were indulging their appetites by feasting upon the viscera thus extracted The liver of a Ximian was in such request at this period that if the market had been properly managed and supplied this delicacy would have sold for two  Obans a pound or about four pounds sterling The troops in the North might have provided at the rate of a thousand head per month for the demand of Meaco and tho' the other parts of the carcase would not have sold at so high a price as the liver heart harrigals sweetbread and pope's eye yet the whole upon an average would have fetched at the rate of three hundred pounds a head especially if those animals which are but poorly fed in their own country had been fattened up and kept upon hard meat for the slaughter This new branch of traffick would have produced about three hundred and sixty thousand pounds annually for the rebellion might easily have been fomented from year to year and consequently it would have yielded a considerable addition to the emperor's revenue by a proper taxation  The philosophers of Japan were divided in their opinions concerning  this new taste for Ximian flesh which suddenly sprung up among the Japonese Some ascribed it to a principle of hatred and revenge agreeable to the common expression of animosity among the multitude  "You dog I'll have your liver"  Others imputed it to a notion analagous to the vulgar conceit that the liver of a mad dog being eaten is a preventive against madness ergo the liver of a traitor is an antidote against treason A third sort derived this strange appetite from the belief of the Americans who imagine they shall inherit all the virtues of the enemies they devour and a fourth affirmed that the demand for this dainty arose from a very high and peculiar flavour in Ximian flesh which flavour was discovered by accident moreover there were not wanting some who supposed this banquet was a kind of sacrifice to the powers of sorcery  as we find that one of the ingredients of the charm prepared in Shakespear's cauldron was  "the liver of blaspheming Jew"  and indeed it is not at all improbable that the liver of a rebellious Ximian might be altogether as effectual I know that Fikakaka was stimulated by curiosity to try the experiment and held divers consultations with his cooks on this subject They all declared in favour of the trial and it was accordingly presented at the table where the Cuboy eat of it to such excess as to produce a surfeit He underwent a severe evacuation both ways attended with cold sweats and swoonings In a word his agony was so violent that he ever after loathed the sight of Ximian flesh whether dead or alive  With the Fatzman Quambacundono was connected another Quo called Gottomio viceroy of Xicoco one of the islands of Japan If  his understanding had been as large as his fortune and his temper a little more tractable he would have been a dangerous rival to the Cuboy But if their brains had been weighed against each other the nineteenth part of a grain would have turned either scale and as Fikakaka had negative qualities which supported and extended his personal influence so Gottomio had positive powers that defended him from all approaches of popularity His pride was of the insolent order his temper extremely irascible and his avarice quite rapacious nay he is said to have once declined the honour of a kicking from the Dairo Conceited of his own talents he affected to harangue in the council of Twenty Eight but his ideas were embarrassed his language was mean and his elocution more discordant than the braying of fifty asses When Fikakaka addressed himself to speech an  agreeable simper played upon the countenances of all the audience but soon as Gottomio stood up every spectator raised his thumbs to his ears as it were instinctively The Dairo Gothamababa by the advice of the Cuboy sent him over to govern the people of Xicoco and a more effectual method could not have been taken to mortify his arrogance His deportment was so insolent his oeconomy so sordid and his government so arbitrary that those islanders who are remarkably ferocious and impatient expressed their hatred and contempt of him on every occasion His Quanbukuship was hardly safe from outrage in the midst of his guards and a cross was actully erected for the execution of his favourite Kowkin who escaped with some difficulty to the island of Niphon whither also his patron soon followed him attended by the curses of the people whom he had been sent to rule  He who presided at the council of Twenty Eight was called Soosansino an old experienced shrewd politician who conveyed more sense in one single sentence than could have been distilled from all the other brains in council had they been macerated in one alembic He was a man of extensive learning and elegant taste He saw through the characters of his fellowlabourers in the adn He laughed at the folly of one faction and detested the arrogance and presumption of the other In an assembly of sensible men his talents would have shone with superior lustre but at the council of Twenty Eight they were obscured by the thick clouds of ignorance that enveloped his brethren The Dairo had a personal respect for him and is said to have conferred frequent favours on his posteriors in private He kicked the Cuboy often  ex officio  as a husband thinks it incumbent upon  him to caress his wife but he kicked the president for pleasure as a voluptuary embraces his mistress Soosansino conscious that he had no family interest to support him in cabals among the people and careless of his country's fate resolved to enjoy the comforts of life in quiet He laughed and quaffed with his select companions in private received his appointments thankfully and swam with the tide of politicks as it happened to flowIt was pretty extraordinary that the wisest man should be the greatest cypher but such was the will of the gods  Besides these great luminaries that enlightened the cabinet of Japan I shall have occasion in the course of my narrative to describe many other stars of an inferior order At this board there was as great a variety of characters as we find in the celebrated table of Cebes Nay indeed what was objected to the philosopher  might have been more justly said of the Japonese councils There was neither invention unity nor design among them They consisted of mobs of sauntering strolling vagrant and ridiculous politicians Their schemes were absurd and their deliberations like the sketches of anarchy All was bellowing bleating braying grinning grumbling confusion and uproar It was more like a dream of chaos than a picture of human life If the ΔΑΙΜΩΝ or Genius was wanting it must be owned that Fikakaka exactly answered Cebes's description of ΤΥΧΗ or Fortune blind and frantic running about every where giving to some and taking from others without rule or distinction while her emblem of the round stone fairly shews his  giddy  nature  Here however one might have seen many other figures of the painter's allegory such as Deception tendering the cup of ignorance and  error opinions and appetites Disappointment and Anguish Debauchery Profligacy Gluttony and Adulation Luxury Fraud Rapine Perjury and Sacrilege but not the least traces of the virtues which are described in the groupe of true education and in the grove of happiness  The two factions that divided the council of Japan tho' inveterate enemies to each other heartily and cordially concurred in one particular which was the worship established in the temple of Fakkubasi or the White Horse This was the orthodox faith in Japan and was certainly founded as St Paul saith of the Christian religion upon the evidence of things not seen All the votaries of this superstition of Fakkubasi subscribed and swore to the following creed implicitly without hesitation or mental reservation  "I believe in the White Horse that he descended  from heaven and sojourned in Jeddo which is the land of promise I believe in  Bupo  his apostle who first declared to the children of Niphon the glad tidings of the gospel of Fakkubasi I believe that the White Horse was begot by a black mule and brought forth by a green dragon that his head is of silver and his hoofs are of brass that he eats gold as provender and discharges diamonds as dung that the Japonese are ordained and predestined to furnish him with food and the people of Jeddo to clear away his litter I believe that the island of Niphon is joined to the continent of Jeddo and that whoever thinks otherwise shall be damned to all eternity I believe that the smallest portion of matter may be practically divided  ad infinitum  that equal quantities taken from equal quantities an unequal quantity will remain that two and two make seven that the sun rules  the night the stars the day and the moon is made of green cheese Finally I believe that a man cannot be saved without devoting his goods and his chattels his children relations and friends his senses and ideas his soul and his body to the religion of the White Horse as it is prescribed in the ritual of Fakkubasi"  These are the tenets which the Japonese ministers swallowed as glib as the English clergy swallow the thirtynine articles  Having thus characterised the chiefs that disputed the administration or in other words the empire of Japan I shall now proceed to a plain narration of historical incidents without pretending to philosophize like He or dogmatize like Stt I shall only tell thee Nathaniel that Britain never gave birth but to two historians worthy of credit and they were Taliessin and Geoffrey of Monmouth I'll  tell you another secret The whole world has never been able to produce six good historians Herodotus is fabulous even to a proverb Thucydides is perplexed obscure and unimportant Polybius is dry and inelegant Livy superficial and Tacitus a coxcomb Guicciardini wants interest Davila digestion and Sarpi truth In the whole catalogue of French historians there is not one of tolerable authenticity  In the year of the period Foggien one hundred and fifty four the tranquility of Japan was interrupted by the incroachments of the Chinese adventurers who made descents upon certain islands belonging to the Japonese a great way to the southward of Xicoco They even settled colonies and built forts on some of them while the two empires were at peace with each other When the Japonese governors expostulated with the Chinese officers on this intrusion  they were treated with ridicule and contempt then they had recourse to force of arms and some skirmishes were fought with various success When the tidings of these hostilities arrived at Meaco the whole council of TwentyEight was overwhelmed with fear and confusion The Dairo kicked them all round not from passion but by way of giving an animating fillip to their deliberative faculties The disputes had happened in the island of Fatsissio but there were only three members of the council who knew that Fatsissio was an island although the commerce there carried on was of the utmost importance to the empire of Japan They were as much in the dark with respect to its situation Fikakaka on the supposition that it adjoined to the coast of Corea expressed his apprehension that the Chinese would invade it with a numerous army and was so transported  when Foksiroku assured him it was an island at a vast distance from any continent that he kissed him five times in the face of the whole council and his royal master Gothamababa swore he should be indulged with a double portion of kicking at his next private audience The same counsellor proposed that as the Fune or navy of Japan was much more numerous than the fleet of China they should immediately avail themselves of this advantage Quambacundono the Fatzman was of opinion that war should be immediately declared and an army transported to the continent Stiphirumpoo thought it would be more expedient to sweep the seas of the Chinese trading vessels without giving them any previous intimation and to this opinion admiral Ninkompoopo subscribed not only out of deference to the superior understanding of his sage ally who undertook  to prove it was not contrary to the law of nature and nations to plunder the subjects of foreign powers who trade on the faith of treaties but also from his own inclination which was much addicted to pillage without bloodshed To him therefore the task was left of scouring the seas and intercepting the succours which they had received intelligence were ready to sail from one of the ports of China to the island of Fatsissio In the mean time junks were provided for transporting thither a body of Japonese troops under the command of one Koan an obscure officer without conduct or experience whom the Fatzman selected for this service not that he supposed him possessed of superior merit but because no leader of distinction cared to engage in such a disagreeable expedition  Ninkompoopo acted according to the justest ideas which had been  formed of his understanding He let loose his cruisers among the merchant ships of China and the harbours of Japan were quickly filled with prizes and prisoners The Chinese exclaimed against these proceedings as the most perfidious acts of piracy and all the other powers of Asia beheld them with astonishment But the consummate wisdom of the sea Seyseogun appeared most conspicuous in another stroke of generalship which he now struck Instead of blocking up in the Chinese harbour the succours destined to reinforce the enemy in Fatsissio until they should be driven from their incroachments on that island he very wisely sent a strong squadron of Fune to cruise in the open sea midway between China and Fatsissio in the most tempestuous season of the year when the fogs are so thick and so constant in that latitude as to rival the darkness of a winter  night and supported the feasibility of this scheme in council by observing that the enemy would be thus decoyed from their harbour and undoubtedly intercepted in their passage by the Japonese squadron This plan was applauded as one of the most ingenious stratagems that ever was devised and Fikakaka insisted upon kissing his posteriors as the most honourable mark of his approbation  Philosophers have observed that the motives of actions are not to be estimated by events Fortune did not altogether fulfil the expectations of the council General Koan suffered himself and his army to be decoyed into the middle of a wood where they stood like sheep in the shambles to be slaughtered by an unseen enemy The Chinese succours perceiving their harbour open set sail for Fatsissio which they reached in safety by changing their  course about one degree from the common route while the Japonese Fune continued cruising among the fogs until the ships were shattered by storms and the crews more than half destroyed by cold and distemper  When the news of these disasters arrived great commotion arose in the council The Dairo Gothamababa fluttered and clucked and cackled and hissed like a goose disturbed in the act of incubation Quambacundono shed bitter tears the Cuboy snivelled and sobbed Stiphirumpoo groaned Gottomio swore but the sea Seyseogun Ninkompoopo underwent no alteration He sat as the emblem of insensibility fixed as the north star and as cold as that luminary sending forth emanations of frigidity Fikaka mistaking this congelation for fortitude went round and embraced him where he sat exclaiming  "My  dear Day Seyseogun what would you advise in this dilemma"  But the contact had almost cost him his life for the touch of Ninkompoopo thus congealed had the same effect as that of the fish called Torpor The Cuboy's whole body was instantly benumbed and if his friends had not instantly poured down his throat a considerable quantity of strong spirit the circulation would have ceased This is what philosophers call a generation of cold which became so intense that the mercury in a Japonese thermometer constructed on the same principles which were afterwards adopted by Fahrnheit and fixed in the apartment immediately sunk thirty degrees below the freezing point  The first astonishment of the council was succeeded by critical remarks and argumentation The Dairo consoled himself by observing that his troops made a very soldierly  appearance as they lay on the field in their new cloathing smart caps and clean buskins and that the enemy allowed they had never seen beards and whiskers in better order He then declared that should a war ensue with China he would go abroad and expose himself for the glory of Japan Foksiroku expressed his surprize that a general should march his army through a wood in an unknown country without having it first reconnoitred but the Fatzman assured him that was a practice never admitted into the discipline of Japan Gottomio swore the man was mad to stand with his men like oxen in a stall to be knocked on the head without using any means of defence  "Why the devil said he did not he either retreat or advance to close engagement with the handful of Chinese who formed the ambuscade"  "I hope my dear Quanbuku replied the  Fatzman that the troops of Japan will always stand without flinching I should have been mortified beyond measure had they retreated without seeing the face of the enemythat would have been a disgrace which never befel any troops formed under my direction and as for advancing the ground would not permit any manoeuvre of that nature They were engaged in a  cul de sac  where they could not form either in hollow square front line potence column or platoonIt was the fortune of war and they bore it like menwe shall be more fortunate on another occasion"  The president Soosansino took notice that if there had been one spaniel in the whole Japonese army this disaster could not have happened as the animal would have beat the bushes and discovered the ambuscade He therefore proposed that if the war was to be prosecuted in Fatsissio  which is a country overgrown with wood a number of bloodhounds might be provided and sent over to run upon the foot in the front and on the flanks of the army when it should be on its march through such impediments Quambacundono declared that soldiers had much better die in the bed of honour than be saved and victorious by such an unmilitary expedient that such a proposal was so contrary to the rules of war and the scheme of enlisting dogs so derogatory from the dignity of the service that if ever it should be embraced he would resign his command and spend the remainder of his life in retirement This canine project was equally disliked by the Dairo who approved of the Fatzman's objection and sealed his approbation with a pedestrian salute of such momentum that the Fatzman could hardly stand under the weight of the compliment It was  agreed that new levies should be made and a new squadron of Fune equipped with all expedition and thus the assembly broke up  Fortune had not yet sufficiently humbled the pride of Japan That body of Chinese which defeated Koan made several conquests in Fastsissio and seemed to be in a fair way of reducing the whole island Yet the court of China not satisfied with this success resolved to strike a blow that should be equally humiliating to the Japonese in another part of the world Having by specious remonstrances already prepossessed all the neighbouring nations against the government of Japan as the patrons of perfidy and piracy they fitted out an armament which was intended to subdue the island of Motao on the coast of Corea which the Japonese had taken in a former war and now occupied at a very great expence as a place of the utmost importance  to the commerce of the empire Repeated advices of the enemy's design were sent from different parts to the my of Japan but they seemed all overwhelmed by such a lethargy of infatuation that no measures of prevention were concerted  Such was the opinion of the people but the truth is they were fast asleep The Japonese hold with the antient Greeks and modern Americans that dreams are from heaven and in any perplexing emergency they like the Indians Jews and natives of Madagascar have recourse to dreaming as to an oracle These dreams or divinations are preceded by certain religious rites analagous to the ceremony of the ephod the urim and the thummim The rites were religiously performed in the council of TwentyEight and a deep sleep overpowered the Dairo and all his counsellors  Gothamababa the emperor who reposed his head upon the pillowy sides of Quambacundono dreamed that he was sacrificing in the temple of Fakkubasi and saw the deity of the White Horse devouring pearls by the bushel at one end and voiding corruption by the ton at the other The Fatzman dreamed that a great number of Chinese cooks were busy buttering his brains Gottomio dreamed of lending money and borrowing sense Stiphirumpoo thought he had procured a new law for clapping padlocks upon the chastity of all the females in Japan under twenty of which padlocks he himself kept the keys Ninkompoopo dreamed he was metamorphosed into a sealion in pursuit of a shoal of golden gudgeons  One did laugh in's sleep and one cried murder  The first was Soosansino who had precisely the same vision that disturbed the imagination of the Cuboy  He thought he saw the face of a right reverend prelate of the Bonzas united with and growing to the posteriors of the minister Fikakaka underwent the same disagreeable illusion with this aggravating circumstance that he already felt the teeth of the said Bonza The president laughed aloud at the ridiculous phaenomenon the Cuboy exclaimed in the terror of being encumbered with such a monstrous appendage It was not without some reason he cried  "Murder"  Foksiroku who happened to sleep on the next chair dreamed of moneybags places and reversions and in the transport of his eagerness laid fast hold on the trunkbreeches of the Cuboy including certain fundamentals which he grasped so violently as to excite pain and extort the exclamation from Fikakaka even in his sleep  The council being at last waked  by the clamours of the people who surrounded the palace and proclaimed that Motao was in danger of an invasion the sea Seyseogun Ninkompoopo was ordered to fit out a fleet of Fune for the relief of that island and directions were given that the commander of these Fune should in his voyage touch at the garrison of Foutao and take on board from thence a certain number of troops to reinforce the Japonese governor of the place that was in danger Ninkompoopo for this service chose the commander Bihngoh a man who had never signalized himself by any act of valour He sent him out with a squadron of Fune ill manned wretchedly provided and inferior in number to the fleet of China which was by this time known to be assembled in order to support the invasion of the island of Motao He sailed nevertheless on this expedition and touched at the garrison of Foutao to  take in the reinforcement but the orders sent for this purpose from Nobodi minister for the department of war appeared so contradictory and absurd that they could not possibly be obeyed so that Bihngoh proceeded without the reinforcement towards Motao the principal fortress of which was by this time invested He had been accidentally joined by a few cruisers which rendered him equal in strength to the Chinese squadron which he now descried Both commanders seemed afraid of each other The fleets however engaged but little damage was done to either They parted as if by consent Bihngoh made the best of his way back to Foutao without making the least attempt to succour or open a communication with Fidetada the governor of Motao who looking upon himself as abandoned by his country surrendered his fortress  with the whole island to the Chinese general These disgraces happening on the back of the Fatsissian disasters raised a prodigious ferment in Japan and the ministry had almost sunk under the first fury of the people's resentment They not only exclaimed against the folly of the administration but they also accused them of treachery and seemed to think that the glory and advantage of the empire had been betrayed What increased the commotion was the terror of an invasion with which the Chinese threatened the islands of Japan The terrors of Fikaka had already cost him two pair of trunk hose which were defiled by sudden sallies or irruptions from the postern of his microcosm and these were attended with such noisome effluvia that the Bonzas could not perform the barbal abstersion without marks of abhorrence The emperor himself was seen to stop his nose and  turn away his head when he approached him to perform the pedestrian exercise  Here I intended to insert a dissertation on trousers or trunk breeches called by the Greeks    by the Latins  braccae laxae  by the Spaniards  bragas anchas  by the Italians  calzone largo  by the French  baut de chausses  by the Saxons  braecce  by the Swedes  brackor  by the Irish  briechan  by the Celtae  brag  and by the Japonese  braak  I could make some curious discoveries touching the analogy between the  and  and point out the precise time at which the Grecian women began to wear the breeches I would have demonstrated that the  cingulum muliebre  was originally no other than the wife's literally wearing the husband's trousers at certain  orgia  as a mark of dominion transferred  pro tempore  to the female I would have drawn a curious  parallel between the  of the Greek and the  shim  or middle cloth worn by the black ladies in Guinea I would have proved that breeches were not first used to defend the central parts from the injuries of the weather inasmuch as they were first worn by the Orientals in a warm climate as you may see in Persius  Braccatis illita medisporticus  I would have shewn that breeches were first brought from Asia to the northern parts of Europe by the Celtae sprung from the antient Gomanaus that trousers were wore in Scotland long before the time of Pythagoras and indeed we are told by Jamblychus that Abaris the famous Highland philosopher cotemporary and personally acquainted with the sage of Crotona wore long trousers I myself can attest the truth of that description as I well remember the person and habit of that learned mountaineer I would have explained  the reasons that compelled the posterity of those mountaineers to abandon the breeches of their forefathers and expose their posteriors to the wind I would have convinced the English antiquaries that the inhabitants of Yorkshire came originally from the Highlands of Scotland before the Scots had laid aside their breeches and wore this part of dress long after their ancestors as well as the southern Britons were unbreeched by the Romans From this distinction they acquired the name of  Brigantes quasi Bragantes  and hence came the verb to  brag  or boast contemptuously for the neighbours of the Brigantes being at variance with that people used by way of contumelious defiance when they saw any of them passing or repassing to clap their hands on their posteriors and cry  BragBrag  I would have drawn a learned comparison between the shield of Ajax and the sevenfold  breeches of a Dutch skipper Finally I would have promulgated the original use of trunk breeches which would have led me into a discussion of the rites of Cloacina so differently worshipped by the southern and northern inhabitants of this kingdom These disquisitions would have unveiled the mysteries that now conceal the orgin migration superstition language laws and connexions of different nations  sed nunc non erit his locus  I shall only observe that Linschot and others are mistaken in deriving the Japonese from their neighbours the Chinese and that Dr Kempfer is right in his conjecture supposing them to have come from Media immediately after the confusion of Babel It is no wonder therefore that being  Braccatorum filii  they should retain the wide breeches of their progenitors  Having dropped these hints concerning the origin of breeches I shall now return to the great personage that turned me into this train of thinking The council of TwentyEight being assembled in a great hurry Fikakaka sat about five seconds in silence having in his countenance nearly the same expression which you have seen in the face and attitude of Felix on his tribunal as represented by the facetious Hogarth in his print done after the Dutch taste After some pause he rose and surveying every individual of the council through a long tube began a speech to this effect  "Imperial Gothamababa my everglorious master and you ye illustrious nobles of Japan Quanbukus Quos Days and Daygos my fellows and colleagues in the work of administration it is well known to you all and they are rascals that deny it I  have watched and fasted for the public wealBy Gd I have deprived myself of two hours of my natural rest every night for a week togetherThen I have been so hurried with state affairs that I could not eat a comfortable meal in a whole fortnight and what rendered this misfortune the greater my chief cook had dressed an olio  a la Chine  I say an olio my Lords such an olio as never appeared before upon a table in Japanby the Lord it cost me fifty Obans and I had not time to taste a morselWell then I have watched that my fellowsubjects should sleep I have fasted that they should feedI have not only watched and fasted but I have prayedno not much of thatyes by the Lord I have prayed as it wereI have ejaculatedI have danced and sung at the Matsuris which you know are religious ritesI have headed the multitude  and treated all the ragamuffins in JapanTo be certain I could not do too much for our most excellent and sublime emperor an emperor unequalled in wisdom and unrivalled in generosityWere I to expatiate from the rising of the sun to the setting thereof I should not speak half his praiseO happy nation O fortunate Japan happy in such a Dairo to wield the sceptre and let me add vanity apart fortunate in such a Cuboy to conduct the administrationSuch a prince and such a ministera ha my noble friend Soosansino I see your Dayship smileI know what you think ha haVery well my Lordyou may think what you please but two such headpiecespardon my royal master my presumption in laying our heads together you wo'n't find again in the whole universe ha haI'll be damn'd if you do ha ha ha"  The tumult without doors  was by this time increased to such a degree that the Cuboy could utter nothing more  ab anteriori  and the majority of the members sat aghast in silence The Dairo declared he would throw his cap out of the window into the midst of the populace and challenge any single man of them to bring it up but he was dissuaded from hazarding his sacred person in such a manner Quambacundono proposed to let loose the guards among the multitude but Fikakaka protested he could never agree to an expedient so big with danger to the persons of all present Stiphirumpoo was of opinion that they should proceed according to law and indict the leaders of the mob for a riot Ninkompoopo exhorted the Dairo and the whole council to take refuge on board the fleet Gottomio sweated in silence he trembled for his moneybags and dreaded another encounter with the mob by whom  he had suffered severely in the flesh upon a former occasion The president shrugged up his shoulders and kept his eye fixed upon a postern or backdoor In this general consternation Foksiroku stood up and offered a scheme which was immediately put in execution  "The multitude my Lords said he is a many headed monsterit is a Cerberus that must have a sopit is a wild beast so ravenous that nothing but blood will appease its appetiteit is a whale that must have a barrel for its amusementit is a daemon to which we must offer up human sacrifice Now the question is who is to be this sop this barrel this scapegoatTremble not illustrious Fikakakabe not afraidyour life is of too much consequenceBut I perceive that the Cuboy is movedan unsavoury odour assails my nostrilsbrief let me beBihngoh must be the victimhappy  if the sacrifice of his single life can appease the commotions of his country To him let us impute the loss of Motaolet us in the mean time soothe the rabble with solemn promises that national justice shall be donelet us employ emissaries to mingle in all places of plebeian resort to puzzle perplex and prevaricate to exaggerate the misconduct of Bihngoh to traduce his character with retrospective reproach strain circumstances to his prejudice inflame the resentment of the vulgar against that devoted officer and keep up the flame by feeding it with continual fuel"  The speech was heard with universal applause Foksiroku was kicked by the Dairo and kissed by the Cuboy in token of approbation The populace were dispersed by means of fair promises Bihngoh was put under arrest and kept as a malefactor in close prison Agents were  employed through the whole metropolis to vilify his character and accuse him of cowardice and treachery Authors were enlisted to defame him in public writings and mobs hired to hang and burn him in effigie By these means the revenge of the people was artfully transferred and their attention effectually diverted from the ministry which was the first object of their indignation At length matters being duly prepared for the exhibition of such an extraordinary spectacle Bihngoh underwent a public trial was unanimously found guilty and unanimously declared innocent by the same mouths condemned to death and recommended to mercy but mercy was incompatible with the designs of the adn The unfortunate Bihngoh was crucified for cowardice and bore his fate with the most heroic courage His behaviour at his death was so inconsistent with the crime  for which he was doomed to die that the emissaries of the Cuboy were fain to propagate a report that Bihngoh had bribed a person to represent him at his execution and be crucified in his stead  This was a stratagem very well calculated for the meridian of the Japonese populace and it would have satisfied them intirely had not their fears been concerned But the Chinese had for some time been threatening an invasion the terror of which kept the people of Japan in perpetual agitation and disquiet They neglected their business and ran about in distraction inquiring news listening to reports staring whispering whimpering clamouring neglecting their food and renouncing their repose The Dairo who believed the Tartars of Yesso from whom he himself was descended had more valour and skill and honesty than was possessed by  any other nation on earth took a large body of them into his pay and brought them over to the island of Niphon for the defence of his Japonese dominions The truth is he had a strong predilection for that people he had been nursed among them and sucked it from the nipple His father had succeeded as heir to a paultry farm in that country and there he fitted up a cabin which he preferred to all the palaces of Meaco and Jeddo The son received the first rudiments of his education among these Tartars whose country had given birth to his progenitor Bupo He therefore loved their country he admired their manners because they were conformable to his own and he was in particular captivated by the taste they shewed in trimming and curling their muftachios  In full belief that the Yessites stood as high in the estimation of his Japonese  subjects as in his own he imported a body of them into Niphon where at first they were received as saviours and protectors but the apprehension of danger no sooner vanished than they were exposed to a thousand insults and mortifications arising from the natural prejudice to foreigners which prevails among the people of Japan They were reviled calumniated and maltreated in every different form by every class of people and when the severe season set in the Japonese refused shelter from the extremities of the weather to those very auxiliaries they had hired to defend every thing that was dear to them from the swords of an enemy whom they themselves durst not look in the face In vain Fikakaka employed a double band of artists to tickle their noses They shut their eyes indeed as usual but their eyes no sooner closed than their mouths opened and  out flew the tropes and figures of obloquy and execration They exclaimed that they had not bought but caught the Tartar that they had hired the wolves to guard the sheep that they were simple beasts who could not defend themselves from the dog with their own horns but what could be expected from a flock which was led by such a pusillanimous bellweatherIn a word the Yessites were sent home in disgrace but the serment did not subside and the conduct of the administration was summoned before the venerable tribunal of the populace  There was one Taycho who had raised himself to great consideration in this selfconstituted college of the mob He was distinguished by a loud voice an unabashed countenance a fluency of abuse and an intrepidity of opposition to the measures of the Cuboy who was far from being a favourite with the plebeians  Orator Taycho's eloquence was admirably suited to his audience he roared and he brayed and he bellowed against the mr he threw out personal sarcasms against the Dairo himself He inveighed against his partial attachment to the land of Yesso which he had more than once manifested to the detriment of Japan he inflamed the national prejudice against foreigners and as he professed an inviolable zeal for the commons of Japan he became the first demagogue of the empire The truth is he generally happened to be on the right side The partiality of the Dairo the errors absurdities and corruption of the ministry presented such a palpable mark as could not be missed by the arrows of his declamation This Cerberus had been silenced more than once with a sop but whether his appetite was not satisfied to the full or he was still stimulated by the turbulence of  his disposition which would not allow him to rest he began to shake his chains anew and open in the old cry which was a species of musick to the mob as agreeable as the sound of a bagpipe to a mountaineer of North Britain or the strumstrum to the swarthy natives of Angola It was a strain which had the wonderful effect of effacing from the memory of his hearers every idea of his former sickleness and apostacy  In order to weaken the effect of orator Taycho's harangues the Cuboy had found means to intrude upon the councils of the mob a native of Ximo called Muraclami who had acquired some reputation for eloquence as an advocate in the tribunals of Japan He certainly possessed an uncommon share of penetration with a silver tone of voice and a great magazines of words and phrases which flowed from him in a pleasing tide of elocution He  had withal the art of soothing wheedling insinuating and misrepresenting with such a degree of plausibility that his talents were admired even by the few who had sense enough to detect his sophistry He had no idea of principle and no feeling of humanity He had renounced the maxims of his family after having turned them to the best account by execrating the rites of Fakkubasi or the White Horse in private among malcontents while he worshipped him in public with the appearance of enthusiastic devotion When detected in this double dealing he fairly owned to the Cuboy that he cursed the White Horse in private for his private interest but that he served him in public from inclination  The Cuboy had just sense enough to perceive that he would always be true to his own interest and therefore he made it his interest to serve the my to the full extent of his  faculties Accordingly Muraclami fought a good battle with orator Taycho in the occasional assemblies of the populace But as it is much more easy to inflame than to allay to accuse than to acquit to asperse than to purify to unveil truth than to varnish falshood in a word to patronize a good cause than to support a bad one the majesty of the mob snuffed up the excrementitious salts of Taycho's invectives until their jugulars ached while they rejected with signs of loathing the flowers of Muraclami's elocution just as a citizen of Edinburgh stops his nose when he passes by the shop of a perfumer  While the constitution of human nature remains unchanged satire will be always better received than panegyric in those popular harangues The Athenians and Romans were better pleased with the Philippics of Demosthenes and Tully  than they would have been with all the praise those two orators could have culled from the stores of their eloquence A man feels a secret satisfaction in seeing his neighbour treated as a rascal If he be a knave himself which ten to one is the case he rejoices to see a character brought down to the level of his own and a new member added to his society if he be one degree removed from actual roguery which is the case with ninetenths of those who enjoy the reputation of virtue he indulges himself with the Pharisaical consolation of thanking God he is not like that publican  But to return from this digression Muraclami though he could not with all his talents maintain any sort of competition with Taycho in the opinion of the mob he nevertheless took a more effectual method to weaken the force of his opposition He pointed out to  Fikakaka the proper means for amending the errors of his administration he proposed measures for prosecuting the war with vigour he projected plans of conquest in Fatsissio recommended active officers forwarded expeditions and infused such a spirit into the councils of Japan as had not before appeared for some centuries  But his patron was precluded from the benefit of these measures by the obstinate prejudice and precipitation of the Dairo who valued his Yessian farm above all the empire of Japan This precious morsel of inheritance bordered upon the territories of a Tartar chief called Brutantiffi a famous freebooter who had inured his Kurd to bloodshed and enriched himself with rapine Of all mankind he hated most the Dairo tho' his kinsman and sought a pretence for seizing the farm which in three days he could have made his own  The Dairo Gothamababa was not ignorant of his sentiments He trembled for his cabin when he considered its situation between hawk and buzzard exposed on one side to the talons of Brutantiffi and open on the other to the incursions of the Chinese under whose auspices the said Brutantiffi had acted formerly as a zealous partizan He had indeed in a former quarrel exerted himself with such activity and rancour to thwart the politics of the Dairo and accumulate expences on the subjects of Niphon that he was universally detested through the whole empire of Japan as a lawless robber deaf to every suggestion of humanity respecting no law restricted by no treaty scoffing at all religion goaded by ambition instigated by cruelty and attended by rapine  In order to protect the farm from such a dangerous neighbour Gothamababa by an effort of sagacity peculiar  to himself granted a large subsidy from the treasury of Japan to a remote nation of Mantchoux Tartars on condition that they should march to the assistance of his farm whenever it should be attacked With the same sanity of foresight the Dutch might engage in a defensive league with the Ottoman Porte to screen them from the attempts of the most Christian king who is already on their frontiers Brutantiffi knew his advantage and was resolved to enjoy it He had formed a plan of usurpation which could not be executed without considerable sums of money He gave the Dairo to understand he was perfectly sensible how much the farm lay at his mercy then proposed that Gothamababa should renounce his subsidiary treaty with the Mantchoux pay a yearly tribute to him Brutantiffi in consideration of his forbearing to seize the farm and maintain  an army to protect it on the other side from the irruptions of the Chinese  Gothamababa alarmed at this declaration began by his emissaries to sound the inclinations of his Japonese subjects touching a continental war for the preservation of the farm but he found them totally averse to this wise system of politicks Taycho in particular began to bawl and bellow among the mob upon the absurdity of attempting to defend a remote cabin which was not defensible upon the iniquity of ruining a mighty empire for the sake of preserving a few barren acres a naked common a poor pitiful pelting farm the interest of which like Aaron's rod had already on many occasions swallowed up all regard and consideration for the advantage of Japan He inveighed against the shameful and senseless partiality of Gothamababa he mingled menaces with his  representations He expatiated on the folly and pernicious tendency of a continental war he enlarged upon the independence of Japan secure in her insular situation He declared that not a man should be sent to the continent nor a subsidy granted to any greedy mercenary freebooting Tartar and threatened that if any corrupt minister should dare to form such a connexion he would hang it about his neck like a millstone to sink him to perdition The bellows of Taycho's oratory blew up such a flame in the nation that the Cuboy and all his partizans were afraid to whisper one syllable about the farm  Mean while Brutantiffi in order to quicken their determinations withdrew the garrison he had in a town on the frontiers of China and it was immediately occupied by the Chinese an army of whom poured in like a deluge through this opening upon the lands adjoining to the farm  Gothamababa was now seized with a sit of temporary distraction He foamed and raved and cursed and swore in the Tartarian language he declared he would challenge Brutantiffi to single combat He not only kicked but also cuffed the whole council of TwentyEight and played at football with his imperial tiara Fikakaka was dumbfounded Stiphirumpoo muttered something about a commission of lunacy Ninkompoopo pronounced the words flatbottomed junks but his teeth chattered so much that his meaning could not be understood The Fatzman offered to cross the sea and put himself at the head of a body of light horse to observe the motions of the enemy and Gottomio prayed fervently within himself that God Almighty would be pleased to annihilate that accursed farm which had been productive of such mischief to Japan Nay he even ventured to  exclaim  "Would to God the farm was sunk in the middle of the Tartarian ocean"  "Heaven forbid cried the president Soosansino for in that case Japan must be at the expence of weighing it up again"  In the midst of this perplexity they were suddenly surprised at the apparition of Taycho's head nodding from a window that overlooked their deliberations At sight of this horrid spectacle the council broke up The Dairo fled to the inmost recesses of the palace and all his counsellors vanished except the unfortunate Fikakaka whose fear had rendered him incapable of any sort of motion but one and that he instantly had to a very efficacious degree Taycho bolting in at the window advanced to the Cuboy without ceremony and accosted him in these words  "It depends upon the Cuboy whether Taycho continues to oppose his measures or becomes his  most obsequious servant Arise illustrious Quanbuku and cast your eyes upon the steps by which I ascended"  Accordingly Fikakaka looked and saw a multitude of people who had accompanied their orator into the court of the palace and raised for him an occasional stair of various implements The first step was made by an old figbox the second by a nightman's bucket the third by a cask of hempseed the fourth by a tarbarrel the fifth by an empty kilderkin the sixth by a keg the seventh by a bag of soot the eighth by a fishwoman's basket the ninth by a rotten packsaddle and the tenth by a block of hard wood from the island of Fatsissio It was supported on one side by a varnished lettered post and on the other by a crazy hogshead The artificers who erected this climax and now exulted over it with hideous clamour consisted of grocers scavengers haltermakers  carpenters draymen distillers chimneysweepers oysterwomen assdrivers aldermen and dealers in waste paperTo make myself understood I am obliged Peacock to make use of those terms and denominations which are known in this metropolis  Fikakaka having considered this work with astonishment and heard the populace declare upon oath that they would exalt their orator above all competition was again addressed by the invincible Taycho  "Your Quanbukuship perceives how bootless it will be to strive against the torrentWhat need is there of many words admit me to a share of the administrationI will commence your humble slaveI will protect the farm at the expence of Japan while there is an Oban left in the island of Niphon and I will muzzle these bears so effectually that they shall not shew their teeth except  in applauding our proceedings"  An author who sees the apparition of a bailiff standing before him in his garret and instead of being shewn a  capias  is presented with a bank note an impatient lover stopped upon Bagshot heath by a person in a masque who proves to be his sweetheart come to meet him in disguise for the sake of the frolick a condemned criminal who on the morning of executionday instead of being called upon by the finisher of the law is visited by the sheriff with a free pardon could not be more agreeably surprised than was Fikakaka at the demagogue's declaration He flew into his embrace and wept aloud with joy calling him his dear Taycho He squeezed his hand kissed him on both cheeks and swore he should share the better half of all his power then he laughed and snivelled by turns lolled out his tongue  waddled about the chamber wriggled and niggled and noddled Finally he undertook to prepare the Dairo for his reception and it was agreed that the orator should wait on his new colleague next morningThis matter being settled to their mutual satisfaction Taycho retreated through the window into the courtyard and was convoyed home in triumph by that manyheaded hydra the mob which shook its multitudinous tail and brayed through every throat with hideous exultation  The Cuboy mean while had another trial to undergo a trial which he had not foreseen Taycho was no sooner departed than he hied him to the Dairo's cabinet in order to communicate the happy success of his negotiation But at certain periods Gothamababa's resentment was more than a match for any other passion that belonged to his disposition and now it was its turn to  reign The Dairo was made of very combustible materials and these had been kindled up by the appearance of orator Taycho who he knew had treated his person with indecent freedoms and publickly vilified the worship of the White Horse When Fikakaka therefore told him he had made peace with the demagogue the Dairo instead of giving him the kick of approbation turned his own back upon the Cuboy and silenced him with a  boh  Had Fikakaka assailed him with the same syllogistical sophism which was used by the Stagyrite to Alexander in a passion perhaps he might have listened to reason    "Anger should be raised not by our equals but by our superiors but you have no equal"  Certain it is that Gothamababa had no equal but Fikakaka was no more like Aristotle than his master resembled  Alexander The Dairo remained deaf to all his remonstrances tears and intreaties until he declared that there was no other way of saving the farm but that of giving  charte blanche  to Taycho This argument seemed at once to dispel the clouds which had been compelled by his indignation he consented to receive the orator in quality of minister and next day was appointed for his introduction  In the morning Taycho the Great repaired to the palace of the Cuboy where he privately performed the ceremony of osculation  a posteriori  sung a solemn Palinodia on the subject of political system repeated and signed the Buponian creed embraced the religion of Fakkubasi and adored the White Horse with marks of unfeigned piety and contrition Then he was conducted to the antichamber of the emperor who could not without great difficulty so far master  his personal dislike as to appear before him with any degree of composure He was brought forth by Fikakaka like a tame bear to the stake if that epithet of  tame  can be given with any propriety to an animal which no body but his keeper dares approach The orator perceiving him advance made a low obeisance according to the custom of Japan that is by bending the body averse from the Dairo and laying the right hand upon the left buttock and pronounced with an audible voice  "Behold invincible Gothamababa a sincere penitent come to make atonement for his virulent opposition to your government for his atrocious insolence to your sacred person I have calumniated your favourite farm I have questioned your integrity I have vilified your character ridiculed your understanding and despised your authority"  This recapitulation was so disagreeable to  the Dairo that he suddenly flew off at a tangent and retreated growling to his den from whence he could by no means be lugged again by the Cuboy until Taycho exalting his voice uttered these words  "But I will exalt your authority more than ever it was debasedI will extol your wisdom and expatiate on your generosity I will glorify the White Horse and sacrifice all the treasures of Japan if needful for the protection of the farm of Yesso"  By these cabalistical sounds the wrath of Gothamababa was intirely appeased He now returned with an air of gaiety strutting sideling circling fluttering and cobbling like a turkeycock in his pride when he displays his seathers to the sun Taycho hailed the omen and turning his face from the emperor received such a salutation on the  os sacrum  that the parts continued vibrating and singling for several days  An indenture tripartite was now drawn up and executed Fikakaka was continued treasurer with his levees his Bonzas and his places and orator Taycho undertook in the character of chief scribe to protect the farm of Yesso as well as to bridle and manage the blatant beast whose name was Legion That a person of his kidney should have the presumption to undertake such an affair is not at all surprising the wonder is that his performance should even exceed his promise The truth is he promised more than he could have performed had not certain unforeseen incidents in which he had no concern contributed towards the infatuation of the people  The first trial to which he brought his ascendency over the mob was his procuring from them a free gift to enable the Dairo to arm his own private tenants in Yesso together with some ragamuffin Tartars in the  neighbourhood for the defence of the farm They winked so hard upon this first overact of his apostacy that he was fully persuaded they had resigned up all their senses to his direction and resolved to shew them to all Europe as a surprising instance of his art in monstertaming This furious beast not only suffered itself to be bridled and saddled but frisked and fawned and purred and yelped and crouched before the orator licking his feet and presenting its back to the burthens which he was pleased to impose Immediately after this first essay Qambacundono the Fatzman was sent over to assemble and command a body of light horse in Yesso in order to keep an eye on the motions of the enemy and indeed this vigilant and sagacious commander conducted himself with such activity and discretion that he soon brought the war in those parts to a point of termination  Mean while Brutantiffi continuing to hover on the skirts of the farm at the head of his myrmidons and demanding of the Dairo a categorical answer to the hints he had given Gothamababa underwent several successive fits of impatience and distraction The Cuboy instigated by his own partizans and in particular by Muraclami who hoped to see Taycho take some desperate step that would ruin his popularity I say the Cuboy thus stimulated began to ply the orator with such pressing intreaties as he could no longer resist and now he exhibited such a specimen of his own power and the people's insanity as transcends the flight of ordinary faith Without taking the trouble to scratch their long ears tickle their noses drench them with mandragora or geneva or make the least apology for his own turning tail to the principles which he had all his life so  strenuously inculcated he crammed down their throats an obligation to pay a yearly tribute to Brutantiffi in consideration of his forbearing to seize the Dairo's farm a tribute which amounted to seven times the value of the lands for the defence of which it was payed When I said  crammed  I ought to have used another phrase The beast far from shewing any signs of loathing closed its eyes opened its hideous jaws and as it swallowed the inglorious bond wagged its tail in token of intire satisfaction  No fritter on Shrove Tuesday was ever more dexterously turned than were the hydra's brains by this mountebank in patriotism this juggler in politicks this cat in pan or cake in pan or  in principle Some people gave out that he dealt with a conjurer and others scrupled not to insinuate that he had sold himself to the evil spirit But there was  no occasion for a conjurer to deceive those whom the daemon of folly had previously confounded and as to selling he sold nothing but the interest of his country and of that he made a very bad bargain Be that as it may the Japonese now viewed Brutantiffi either through a new perspective or else surveyed him with organs intirely metamorphosed Yesterday they detested him as a profligate ruffian lost to all sense of honesty and shame addicted to all manner of vice a scoffer at religion particularly that of Fakkubasi the scourge of human nature and the inveterate enemy of Japan Today they glorified him as an unblemished hero the protector of good faith the mirror of honesty the pattern of every virtue a saint in piety a devout votary to the White Horse a friend to mankind the fast ally and the firmest prop of the Japonese empire  The farm of Yesso which they had so long execrated as a putrid and painful excrescence upon the breech of their country which would never be quiet until this cursed wart was either exterminated or taken away they now fondled as a favourite mole nay and cherished as the apple of their eye One would have imagined that all the inconsistencies and absurdities which characterise the Japonese nation had taken their turns to reign just as the interest of Taycho's ambition required When it was necessary for him to establish new principles at that very instant their levity prompted them to renounce their former maxims Just as he had occasion to fascinate their senses the daemon of caprice instigated them to shut their eyes and hold out their necks that they might be led by the nose At the very nick of time when he adopted the cause of Brutantiffi in diametrical  opposition to all his former professions the spirit of whim and singularity disposed them to kick against the shins of common sense deny the light of day at noon and receive in their bosoms as a dove the man before whom they had shunned as a serpent Thus every thing concurred to establish for orator Taycho a despotism of popularity and that not planned by reason or raised by art but founded on fatality and finished by accident  Quos Jupiter vult perdere priùs dementat  Brutantiffi being so amply gratified by the Japonese for his promise of forbearance with respect to the farm of Yesso and determined at all events to make some new acquisition turned his eyes upon the domains of Polhassanakousti another of his neighbours who had formed a most beautiful colony in this part of Tartary and rushed upon it at a minute's warning His  resolution in this respect was so suddenly taken and quickly executed that he had not yet formed any excuse for this outrage in order to save appearances Without giving himself the trouble to invent a pretence he drove old Polhassanakousti out of his residence compelled the domestics of that prince to enter among his own banditti plundered his house seized the archives of his family threatened to shoot the antient gentlewoman his wife exacted heavy contribution from the tenants then dispersed a manifesto in which he declared himself the best friend of the said Akousti and his spouse assuring him he would take care of his estate as a precious deposit to be restored to him in due season In the mean time he thought proper to sequester the rents that they might not enable Polhassan to take any measures that should conduce to his own prejudice As for  the articles of meat drink clothing and lodging for him and his wife and a large family of small children he had nothing to do but depend upon Providence until the present troubles should be appeased His behaviour on this occasion Peacock puts me in mind of the Spaniard whom Philip II employed to assassinate his own son Don Carlos This compassionate Castilian when the prince began to deplore his fate twirled his mustachio pronouncing with great gravity these words of comfort  "  Calla calla Senor todo que se haze es por su bien  "  "I beg your highness won't make any noise this is all for your own good"  or the politeness of Gibbet in the play called the Beaux Stratagem who says to Mrs Sullen  "Your jewels Madam if you pleasedon't be under any uneasiness Madamif you make any noise I shall blow your brains outI have a particular regard for the ladies Madam"  But the possession of Polhassan's demesnes was not the ultimate aim of Brutantiffi He had an eye to a fair and fertile province belonging to a Tartar princess of the house of Ostrog He saw himself at the head of a numerous banditti trained to war fleshed in carnage and eager for rapine his coffers were filled with the spoils he had gathered in his former freebooting expeditions and the incredible sums payed him as an annual tribute from Japan added to his other advantages rendered him one of the most formidable chiefs in all Tartary Thus elated with the consciousness of his own strength he resolved to make a sudden irruption into the dominions of Ostrog at a season of the year when that house could not avail itself of the alliances they had formed with other powers and he did not doubt but that in a few weeks he should be able to subdue the whole  country belonging to the Amazonian princess But I can tell thee Peacock his views extended even farther than the conquest of the Ostrog dominions He even aspired at the empire of Tartary and had formed the design of deposing the great Cham who was intimately connected with the princess of Ostrog Inspired by these projects he at the beginning of winter suddenly poured like a deluge into one of the provinces that owned this Amazon's sway but he had hardly gained the passes of the mountains when he found himself opposed by a numerous body of forces assembled under the command of a celebrated general who gave him battle without hesitation and handled him so roughly that he was fain to retreat into the demesnes of Polhassan where he spent the greatest part of the winter in exacting contributions and extending the reign of desolation  All the petty princes and states who hold of the great Cham began to tremble for their dominions and the Cham himself was so much alarmed at the lawless proceedings of Brutantiffi that he convoked a general assembly of all the potentates who possessed fiefs in the empire in order to deliberate upon measures for restraining the ambition of this ferocious freebooter Among others the Dairo of Japan as lord of the farm of Yesso sent a deputy to this convention who in his master's name solemnly disclaimed and professed his detestation of Brutantiffi's proceedings which indeed were universally condemned The truth is he at this period dreaded the resentment of all the other coestates rather more than he feared the menaces of Brutantiffi and in particular apprehended a sentence of outlawry from the Cham by which at once he would have forfeited  all legal title to his beloved farm Brutantiffi on the other hand began to raise a piteous clamour as if he meant to excite compassion He declared himself a poor injured prince who had been a dupe to the honesty and humanity of his own heart He affirmed that the Amazon of Ostrog had entered into a conspiracy against him with the Mantchoux Tartars and prince Akousti he published particulars of this dreadful conjuration which appeared to be no other than a defensive alliance formed in the apprehension that he would fall upon some of them without any regard to treaty as he had done on a former occasion when he seized one of the Amazon's best provinces He publickly taxed the Dairo of Japan with having prompted him to commence hostilities and hinted that the said Dairo was to have shared his conquests He openly intreated his coestates to  interpose their influence towards the reestablishment of peace in the empire and gave them privately to understand that he would ravage their territories without mercy should they concur with the Cham in any sentence to his prejudice  As he had miscarried in his first attempt and perceived a terrible cloud gathering around him in all probability he would have been glad to compound matters at this juncture on condition of being left in  statu quo  but this was a condition not to be obtained The princess of Ostrog had by this time formed such a confederacy as threatened him with utter destruction She had contracted an offensive and defensive alliance with the Chinese the Mantchoux and the Serednee Tartars and each of these powers engaged to furnish a separate army to humble the insolence of Brutantiffi The majority of the Tartar fiefs agreed to raise a  body of forces to act against him as a disturber of the publick peace the great Cham threatened him with a decree of outlawry and rebellion and the Amazon herself opposed him at the head of a very numerous and warlike tribe which had always been considered as the most formidable in that part of Tartary Thus powerfully sustained she resolved to enjoy her revenge and at any rate retrieve the province which had been ravished from her by Brutantiffi at a time when she was embarrassed with other difficulties Brutantiffi did not think himself so reduced as to purchase peace with such a sacrifice The Mantchoux were at a great distance naturally slow in their motions and had a very long march through a desert country which they would not attempt without having first provided prodigious magazines The Serednee were a divided people among whom he had made shift to foment  intestine divisions that would impede the national operations of the war The Japonese Fatzman formed a strong barrier between him and the Chinese the army furnished by the fiefs he despised as raw undisciplined militia besides their declaring against him afforded a specious pretence for laying their respective dominions under contribution But he chiefly depended upon the coffers of Japan which he firmly believed would hold out until all his enemies should be utterly exhausted  As this freebooter was a principal character in the drama which I intend to rehearse I shall sketch his portrait according to the information I received from a fellowatom who once resided at his court constituting part in one of the organs belonging to his first chamberlain His stature was under the middle size his aspect mean and forbidting  with a certain expression which did not at all prepossess the spectator in favour of his morals Had an accurate observer beheld him without any exterior distinctions in the streets of this metropolis he would have naturally clapped his hands to his pockets Thou hast seen the character of Gibbet represented on the stage by a late comedian of expressive feature Nature sometimes makes a strange contrast between the interior workmanship and the exterior form but here the one reflected a true image of the other His heart never felt an impression of tenderness his notions of right and wrong did not refer to any idea of benevolence but were founded entirely on the convenience of human commerce and there was nothing social in the turn of his disposition By nature he was stern insolent and rapacious uninfluenced by any motive of humanity unawed by any precept of  religion With respect to religion he took all opportunities of exposing it to ridicule and contempt Liberty of conscience he allowed to such extent as exceeded the bounds of decorum and disgraced all legislation He pardoned a criminal convicted of bestiality and publickly declared that all modes of religion and every species of amour might be freely practised and prosecuted through all his dominions His capacity was of the middling mould and he had taken some pains to cultivate his understanding He had studied the Chinese language which he spoke with fluency and piqued himself upon his learning which was but superficial His temper was so capricious and inconstant that it was impossible even for those who knew him best to foresee any one particular of his personal demeanour The same individual he would caress and insult by turns without the least apparent change of  circumstance He has been known to dismiss one of his favourites with particular marks of regard and the most flattering professions of affection and before he had time to pull off his buskins at his own house he has been hurried on horseback by a detachment of cavalry and conveyed to the frontiers Thus harrassed without refreshment or repose he was brought back by another party and reconveyed to the presence of Brutantiffi who embraced him at meeting and gently chid him for having been so long absentThe fixed principles of this Tartar were these insatiable rapacity restless ambition and an insuperable contempt for the Japonese nation His maxims of government were entirely despotic He considered his subjects as slaves to be occasionally sacrificed to the accomplishment of his capital designs but in the mean time he indulged them with the protection  of equitable laws and encouraged them to industry for his own emolument  His virtues consisted of temperance vigilance activity and perseverance His folly chiefly appeared in childish vanity and selfconceit He amused himself with riding reviewing his troops reading Chinese authors playing on a musical instrument in use among the Tartars trifling with buffoons conversing with supposed wits and reasoning with pretended philosophers but he had no communication with the female sex nor indeed was there any ease comfort or enjoyment to be derived from a participation of his pastime His wits philosophers and buffoons were composed of Chinese refugees who soon discovered his weak side and flattered his vanity to an incredible pitch of infatuation They persuaded him that he was an universal genius an invincible  hero a sage legislator a sublime philosopher a consummate politician a divine poet and an elegant historian They wrote systems compiled memoirs and composed poems which were published in his name nay they contrived witticisms which he uttered as his ownThey had by means of commercial communication with the banks of the Ganges procured the history of a Western hero called Raskalander which indeed was no other than the Memoirs of Alexander wrote by Quintus Curtius translated from the Indian language with an intermixture of Oriental fables This they recommended with many hyperbolical encomiums to the perusal of Brutantiffi who became enamoured of the performance and was fired with the ambition of rivalling if not excelling Raskalander not only as a warrior but likewise as a patron of taste and  a protector of the liberal arts As Alexander deposited Homer's Iliad in a precious casket so Brutantiffi procured a golden box for preserving this sophistication of Quintus Curtius It was his constant companion he affected to read it in public and to lay it under his pillow at night  Thus pampered with adulation and intoxicated with dreams of conquest he made no doubt of being able to establish a new empire in Tartary which should entirely eclipse the kingdom of Tummingqua and raise a reputation that should infinitely transcend the fame of Yan or any emperor that ever sat upon the throne of Thibet He now took the field against the Amazon of the house of Ostrog penetrated into her dominions defeated one of her generals in a pitched battle and undertook the siege of one of her principal  cities in full confidence of seeing her kneeling at his gate before the end of the campaign In the mean time her scattered troops were rallied and reinforced by another old experienced commander who being well acquainted with the genius of his adversary pitched upon an advantageous situation where he waited for another attack Brutantiffi flushed with his former victory and firmly persuaded that no mortal power could withstand his prowess gave him battle at a very great disadvantage The consequence was naturalhe lost great part of his army was obliged to abandon the siege and retreat with disgrace A separate body commanded by one of his ablest captains met with the same fate in a neighbouring country and a third detachment at the farthest extremity of his dominions having attacked an army of the  Mantchoux was repulsed with great loss  These were not all the mortifications to which he was exposed about this period The Fatzman of Japan who had formed an army for the defence of the farm of Yesso against the Chinese met with a terrible disaster Notwithstanding his being outnumbered by the enemy he exhibited many proofs of uncommon activity and valour At length they came to blows with him and handled him so roughly that he was fain to retreat from post to pillar and leave the farm at their mercy Had he pursued his route to the right he might have found shelter in the dominions of Brutantiffi and this was his intention but instead of marching in a straight line he revolved to the right like a planet round the sun impelled as it were by a compound impulse until he had described a regular  semicircle and then he found himself with all his followers engaged in a sheeppen from whence there was no egress for the enemy who followed his steps immediately blocked up the entrance The unfortunate Fatzman being thus pounded must have fallen a sacrifice to his centripetal force had not he been delivered by the interposition of a neighbouring chief who prevailed upon the Chinese general to let Quambacundono escape provided his followers would lay down their arms and return peaceably to their own habitations This was a bitter pill which the Fatzman was obliged to swallow and is said to have cost him five stone of suet He returned to Japan in obscurity the Chinese general took possession of the farm in the name of his emperor and all the damage which the tenants sustained was nothing more than a  change of masters which they had no great cause to regret  To the thinking part of the Japanese nothing could be more agreeable than this event by which they were at once delivered from a pernicious excrescence which like an ulcerated tumour exhausted the juices of the body by which it was fed Brutantiffi considered the transaction in a different point of view He foresaw that the Chinese forces would now be at liberty to join his enemies the tribe of Ostrog with whom the Chinese emperor was intimately connected and that it would be next to impossible to withstand the joint efforts of the confederacy which he had brought upon his own head He therefore raised a hideous clamour He accused the Fatzman of misconduct and insisted not without a mixture of menaces upon the Dairo's reassembling  his forces in the country of Yesso  The Dairo himself was inconsolable He neglected his food and refused to confer with his ministers He dismissed the Fatzman from his service He locked himself in his cabinet and spent the hours in lamentation  "O my dear farm of Yesso cried he shall I never more enjoy thy charmsShall I never more regale my eye with thy beauteous prospects thy hills of heath thy meads of broom and thy wastes of sand Shall I never more eat thy black bread drink thy brown beer and feast upon thy delicate porkers Shall I never more receive the homage of the sallow Yessites with their meagre faces ragged skirts and wooden shoes Shall I never more improve their huts and regulate their pigstyes O cruel Fate in vain did I face thy mudwalled mansion with  a new freestone front In vain did I cultivate thy turnepgarden In vain did I enclose a piece of ground at a great expence and raise a crop of barley the first that ever was seen in Yesso In vain did I send over a breed of mules and black cattle for the purposes of husbandry In vain did I supply you with all the implements of agriculture In vain did I sow grass and grain for food and plant trees and furze and fern for shelter to the game which could not otherwise subsist upon your naked downs In vain did I furnish your houseless sides and fill your hungry bellies with the good things of Japan In vain did I expend the treasures of my empire for thy melioration and defence In vain did I incur the execrations of my people if I must now lose thee for ever if thou must now fall into the hands of an insolent alien who has no affection  for thy soil and no regard for thy interest O Quambacundono Quambacundono how hast thou disappointed my hope I thought thou wast too ponderous to flinch that thou wouldst have stood thy ground fixed as the temple of Fakkubasi and larded the lean earth with thy carcase rather than leave my farm uncovered but alas thou hast fled before the enemy like a partridge on the mountains and suffered thyself at last to be taken in a snare like a foolish dotterel"  The Cuboy who overheard this exclamation attempted to comfort him through the keyhole He soothed and whined and wheedled and laughed and wept all in a breath He exhorted the illustrious Gothamababa to bear this misfortune with his wonted greatness of mindHe offered to present his Imperial majesty with lands in Japan  that should be equal in value to the farm he had lost or if that should not be agreeable to make good at the peace all the damage that should be done to it by the enemy Finally he cursed the farm as the cause of his master's chagrin and fairly wished it at the devilHere he was suddenly interrupted with a  "Bubububboh my lord Cuboy your grace talks like an apothecaryGo home to your own palace and direct your cooks and may your bonzes kiss your ato your heart's contentI swear by the horns of the Moon and the hoofs of the White Horse that my foot shall not touch your posteriors these three days"  Fikakaka having received this severe check craved pardon in a whimpering tone for the liberty he had taken and retired to consult with Muraclami who advised him to summon orator Taycho to his assistance  This mobdriver being made acquainted with the passion of the Dairo and the cause of his distress readily undertook to make such a speech through the keyhole as should effectually dispel the emperor's despondence and to this enterprize he was encouraged by the hyperbolical praises of Muraclami who exhausted all the tropes of his own rhetoric in extolling the eloquence of TaychoThis triumvirate immediately adjourned to the door of the apartment in which Gothamababa was seqestered where the orator kneeling upon a cushion with his mouth applied to the keyhole opened the sluices of his elocution to this effect  "Most gracious" "Bo bo boh""Most illustrious" "Bo boh""Most invincible Gothamababa""Boh""When the sun that glorious luminary is obscured by  envious clouds all nature saddens and seems to sympathize with his apparent distressYour Imperial majesty is the sun of our hemisphere whose splendour illuminates our throne and whose genial warmth enlivens our hearts and shall we your subjects your slaves the creatures of your nodshall we unmoved behold your everglorious effulgence overcast No while the vital stream bedews our veins while our souls retain the faculty of reason and our tongues the power of speech we shall not cease to embalm your sorrow with our tears we shall not cease to pour the overflowings of our affectionour filial tenderness which will always be reciprocal with your parental care these are the inexhaustible sources of the nation's happiness They may be compared to the rivers Jodo and Jodogava which derive their common  origin from the vast lake of Ami The one winds its silent course calm clear and majestic reflecting the groves and palaces that adorn its banks and fertilizing the delightful country through which it runs the other gushes impetuous through a rugged channel and less fertile soil yet serves to beautify a number of wild romantic scenes to fill an hundred aqueducts and to turn a thousand mills at length they join their streams below the imperial city of Meaco and form a mighty flood devolving to the bay of Osaca bearing on its spacious bosom the riches of Japan"  Here the orator paused for breaththe Cuboy clapped him on the back whispering  "Superexcellent O charming simile Another such will sink the Dairo's grief to the bottom of the sea and his heart will float like a blown bladder upon  the waves of Kugava"  Muraclami was not silent in his praise while he squeezed an orange between the lips of Taycho and Gothamababa seemed all attention at length the orator resumed his subject"Think not august emperor that the cause of your disquiet is unknown or unlamented by your weeping servants We have not only perceived your eclipse but discovered the invidious body by whose interposition that eclipse is effected The rapacious arms of the hostile Chinese have seized the farm of Yesso  "Oh oh oh"  that farm so cherished by your Imperial favour that farm which in the north of Tartary shone like a jewel in an Aethiop's earyes that jewel hath been snatched by the savage hand of a Chinese free booterbut dry your tears my prince that jewel shall detect his theft and light us to revenge  It shall become a rock to crush him in his retreata net of iron to entangle his steps a fallen trunk over which his feet shall stumble It shall hang like a weight about his neck and sink him to the lowest gulph of perditionBe comforted then my liege your farm is rooted to the center it can neither be concealed nor removed Nay should he hide it at the bottom of the ocean or place it among the constellations in the heavens your faithful Taycho would fish it up intire or tear it headlong from the starry firmamentWe will retrieve the farm of Yesso  "But how how how dear orator Taycho"  "The empire of Japan shall be mortgaged for the sake of that preciousthat sacred spot which produced the patriarch apostle  Bupo  and resounded under the hoofs of the holy steedYour people of Japan shall  chant the litany of FakkubasiThey shall institute crusades for the recovery of the farm they shall pour their treasury at your imperial feetthey shall clamour for impositionthey shall load themselves with tenfold burthens desolate their country and beggar their posterity in behalf of Yesso With these funds I could undertake even to overturn the councils of PekinWhile the Tartar princes deal in the trade of blood there will be no want of hands to cut away those noxious weeds which have taken root in the farm of Yesso those vermin that have preyed upon her delightful blossoms Amidst such a variety of remedies there can be no difficulty in choosingLike a weary traveller I will break a bough from the first pine that presents and brush away those troublesome insects that gnaw the fruits of YessoShould not the mercenary  bands of Tartary suffice to repal those insolent invaders I will engage to chain this island to the continent to build a bridge from shore to shore that shall afford a passage more free and ample than the road to Hell Through this avenue I will ride the mighty beast whose name is LegionI have studied the art of war my LiegeI had once the honour to serve my country as Lancepresado in the militia of NiphonI will unpeople these realms and overspread the land of Yesso with the forces of Japan"  Gothamababa could no longer resist the energy of such expressions He flew to the door of his cabinet and embraced the orator in a transport of joy while Fikakaka fell upon his neck and wept aloud and Muraclami kissed the hem of his garment  You must know Peacock I had by this time changed my situation I was discharged in the perspiratory vapour from the perinaeum of the Cuboy and sucked into the lungs of Muraclami through which I pervaded into the course of the circulation and visited every part of his composition I found the brain so full and compact that there was not room for another particle of matter But instead of a heart he had a membranous sac or hollow viscus cold and callous the habitation of sneaking caution servile flattery griping avarice creeping malice and treacherous deceit Among these tenants it was my fate to dwell and there I discovered the motives by which the lawyer's conduct was influenced He now secretly rejoiced at the presumption of Taycho which he hoped had already prompted him to undertake  more than he could perform in which case he would infallibly incur disgrace either with the Dairo or the people It is not impossible but this hope might have been realized had not fortune unexpectedly interposed and operated as an auxilliary to the orator's presumption Success began to dawn upon the arms of Japan in the island of Fatsisio and towards the end of the campaign Brutantiffi obtained two petty advantages in Tartary against one body of Chinese and another of the Ostrog All these were magnified into astonishing victories and ascribed to the wisdom and courage of Taycho because during his ministry they were obtained though he neither knew why nor wherefore and was in this respect as innocent as his master Gothamababa and his colleague Fikakaka He had penetration enough to perceive  however that these events had intoxicated the rabble and began to pervert their ideas Success of any kind is apt to perturb the weak brain of a Japonese but the acquisition of any military trophy produces an actual deliriumThe streets of Meaco were filled with the multitudes who shouted whooped and hollowed They made processions with flags and banners they illuminated their houses they extolled Ianoni a provincial captain of Fatsisio who had by accident repulsed a body of the enemy and reduced an old barn which they had fortified They magnified Brutantiffi they deified orator Taycho they drank they damned they squabbled and acted a thousand extravagancies which I shall not pretend to enumerate or particularize Taycho who knew their trim seized this opportunity to strike while the iron was hot  He forthwith mounted an old tub which was his public rostrum and waving his hand in an oratorial attitude was immediately surrounded with the thronging popoulaceI have already given you a specimen of his manner and therefore shall not repeat the tropes and figures of his harangue but only sketch out the plan of his address and specify the chain of his argument alone He assailed them in the way of paradox which never fails to produce a wonderful effect upon a heated imagination and a shallow understanding Having in his exordium artfully fascinated their faculties like a juggler in Bartholomewfair by means of an assemblage of words without meaning or import he proceeded to demonstrate that a wise and good man ought to discard his maxims the moment he finds they are certainly established on the foundation  of eternal truth That the people of Japan ought to preserve the farm of Yesso as the apple of their eye because nature had disjoined it from their empire and the maintenance of it would involve them in all the quarrels of Tartary that it was to be preserved at all hazards because it was not worth preserving that all the power and opulence of Japan ought to be exerted and employed in its defence because by the nature of irs situation it could not possibly be defended that Brutantiffi was the great protector of the religion of the Bonzas because he had never shewn the least regard to any religion at all that he was the fast friend of Japan because he had more than once acted as a rancorous enemy to this empire and never let slip the least opportunity of expressing his contempt for the subjects of Niphon that he was an  invincible hero because he had been thrice beaten and once compelled to raise a siege in the course of two campaigns that he was a prince of consummate honour because he had in the time of profound peace usurped the dominions and ravaged the countries of his neighbours in defiance of common honesty in violation of the most solemn treaties that he was the most honourable and important ally that the empire of Japan could choose because his alliance was to be purchased with an enormous annual tribute for which he was bound to perform no earthly office of friendship or assistance because connexion with him effectually deprived Japan of the friendship of all the other princes and states of Tartary and the utmost exertion of his power could never conduce in the smallest degree to the interest or advantage of the Japonese empire  Such were the propositions orator Taycho undertook to demonstrate and the success justified his undertaking After a weak mind has been duly prepared and turned as it were by opening a sluice or torrent of highsounding words the greater the contradiction proposed the stronger impression it makes because it increases the puzzle and lays fast hold on the admiration depositing the small proportion of reason with which it was before impregnated like the vitriol acid in the coppermines of Wicklow into which if you immerse iron it immediately quits the copper which it had before dissolved and unites with the other metal to which it has a strongerattractionOrator Taycho was not so well skilled in logic as to amuse his audience with definitions of concrete and abstract terms or expatiate upon the genus and the difference or state  propositions by the subject the predicate and the copula or form syllogisms by mood and figure but he was perfectly well acquainted with all the equivocal or synonimous words in his own language and could ring the changes on them with great dexterity He knew perfectly well how to express the same ideas by words that literally implied oppositionfor example a valuable conquest or an invaluable conquest a shameful rascal or a shameful villain a hard head or a soft head a large conscience or no conscience immensely great or immensely little damned high or damned low damned bitter damned sweet damned severe damned insipid and damned fulsome He knew how to invert the sense of words by changing the manner of pronunciation e g  "You are a very pretty fellow"  to signify  "You are a very dirty scoundrel"  "You have  always  spoke respectfully of the higher powers"  to express  "You have often insulted your betters and even your sovereign"  "You have  never  turned tail to the principles you professed"  to declare  "You have acted the part of an infamous apostate"  He was well aware that words alter their signification according to the circumstances of times customs and the difference of opinion Thus the name of Jack who used to turn the spit and pull off his master's boots was transferred to an iron machine and a wooden instrument now substituted for these purposes thus a stand for the teakettle acquired the name of Footman and the words Canon and Ordinance signifying originally a rule or law was extended to a piece of artillery which is counted the  ultima lex  or  ultima ratio regum  In the same manner the  words infidel heresy good man and political orthodoxy imply very different significations among different classes of people A Mussulman is an infidel at Rome and a Christian is distinguished as an unbeliever at Constantinople A Papist by Protestantism understands heresy to a Turk the same idea is conveyed by the sect of Ali The term  good man  at Edinburgh implies fanaticism upon the Exchange of London it signifies cash and in the general acceptation benevolence Political orthodoxy has different nay opposite definitions at different places in the same kingdom at Oand C at the Cocoatree in Pallmall and at Garraway's in Exchangealley Our orator was well acquainted with all the legerdemain of his own language as well as with the nature of the beast he had to rule He knew when to distract its  weak brain with a tumult of incongruous and contradictory ideas he knew when to overwhelm its feeble faculty of thinking by pouring in a torrent of words without any ideas annexed These throng in like citymilliners to a Mileend assembly while it happens to be under the direction of a conductor without strength and authority Those that have ideas annexed may be compared to the females provided with partners which though they may croud the place do not absolutely destroy all regulation and decorum But those that are uncoupled press in promiscuously with such impetuosity and in such numbers that the puny master of the ceremonies is unable to withstand the irruption far less to distinguish their quality or accommodate them with partners thus they fall into the dance without order and immediately anarchy ensues  Taycho having kept the monster's brain on a simmer until like the cowheel in Don Quixote it seemed to cry  Comenme comenme  Come eat me come eat me then told them in plain terms that it was expedient they should part with their wives and their children their souls and their bodies their substance and their senses their blood and their suet in order to defend the indefensible farm of Yesso and to support Brutantiffi their insupportable allyThe hydra rolling itself in the dust turned up its huge unwieldy paunch and wagged its forky tail then licked the feet of Taycho and through all its hoarse discordant throats began to bray applause The Dairo rejoiced in his success the firstfruits of which consisted in their agreeing to maintain an army of twenty thousand Tartar mercenaries who were reinforced by the flower of  the national troops of Japan sent over to defend the farm of Yesso and in their consenting to prolong the annual tribute granted to Brutantiffi who in return for this condescension accommodated the Dairo with one of his freebooting captains to command the Yessite army This new general had seen some service and was counted a good officer but it was not so much on account of his military character that he obtained this command as for his dexterity in prolonging the war his skill in exercising all the different arts of peculation and his attachment to Brutantiffi with whom he had agreed to cooperate in milking the Japonese cow This plan they executed with such effect as could not possibly result from address alone unassisted by the infatuation of those whom they pillaged Every article of contingent expence for  draughthorses waggons postage forage provision and secret service was swelled to such a degree as did violence to common sense as well as to common honesty The general had a fellowfeeling with all the contractors in the army who were connected with him in such a manner as seemed to preclude all possibility of detection In vain some of the Japonese officers endeavoured to pry into this mysterious commerce in vain inspectors were appointed by the government of Japan The first were removed on different pretences the last were encountered by such disgraces and discouragements as in a little time compelled them to resign the office they had undertaken In a word there was not a private mercenary Tartar soldier in this army who did not cost the empire of Japan as much as any subaltern officer of its own and the annual charge of  this continental war undertaken for the protection of the farm of Yesso exceeded the whole expence of any former war which Japan had ever maintained on its own account since the beginning of the empire nay it was attended with one circumstance which rendered it still more insupportable The money expended in armaments and operations equipped and prosecuted on the side of Japan was all circulated within the empire so that it still remained useful to the community in general but no instance could be produced of a single copan that ever returned from the continent of Tartary therefore all the sums sent thither were clear loss to the subjects of Japan Orator Taycho acted as a faithful ally to Brutantiffi by stretching the bassstrings of the mobile in such a manner as to be always in concert with the extravagance  of the Tartar's demands and the absurdity of the Dairo's predilection Fikakaka was astonished at these phaenomena while Muraclami hoped in secret that the orator's brain was disordered and that his insanity would soon stand confessed even to the conviction of the people  "If said he to himself they are not altogether destitute of human reason they must of their own accord perceive and comprehend this plain proposition A cask of water that discharges  three  by one pipe and receives no more than  two  by another must infallibly be emptied at the longrun Japan discharges  three  millions of obans every year for the defence of that blessed farm which were it put up to sale would not fetch one sixth part of the sum and the annual ballance of her trade with all the world brings in  two  millions ergo it runs out faster than it runs  in and the vessel at the longrun must be empty"  Muraclami was mistaken He had studied philosophy only in profile He had endeavoured to investigate the sense but he had never fathomed the absurdities of human nature All that Taycho had done for Yesso amounted not to onethird of what was required for the annual expence of Japan while it maintained the war against China in different quarters of Asia A former Cuboy rest his soul finding it impossible to raise within the year the exorbitant supplies that were required to gratify the avarice and ambition of the Dairo had contrived the method of funding which hath been lately adopted with such remarkable success in this kingdom You know Peacock this is no more than borrowing a certain sum on the credit of the nation and laying a  fresh tax upon the public to defray the interest of every sum thus borrowed an excellent expedient when kept within due bounds for securing the established government multiplying the dependants of the mry and throwing all the money of the empire into the hands of the administration But those loans were so often repeated that the national debt had already swelled to an enormous burthen such a variety of taxes was laid upon the subject as grievously inhanced all the necessaries of life consequently the poor were distressed and the price of labour was raised to such a degree that the Japonese manufactures were everywhere undersold by the Chinese traders who employed their workmen at a more moderate expence Taycho in this dilemma was seized with a strange conceit Alchemy was at that period become a favourite  study in Japan Some bonzas having more learning and avarice than their brethren applied themselves to the study of certain Chaldean manuscripts which their ancestors had brought from Assyria and in these they found the substance of all that is contained in the works of Hermes Trismegistus Geber Zosymus the Panapolite Olympiodorus Heliodorus Agathodaemon Morienus Albertus Magnus and above all your countryman Roger Bacon who adopted Geber's opinion that mercury is the common basis and sulphur the cement of all metals By the bye this same friar Bacon was well acquainted with the composition of gunpowder though the reputation arising from the discovery has been given to Swartz who lived many years after that monk of Westminster Whether the Philosopher's stone  otherwise called the Gift Azoth the fifth Essence or the alkahest which last Van Helmont pilfered from the tenth book of the Archidoxa that treasure so long deposited in the occiput of the renowned Aureolus Philippus Paracelsus Theophrastus Bombast de Hohenheim was ever really attained by human adept I am not at liberty to disclose but certain it is the philosophers and alchemists of Japan employed by orator Taycho to transmute baser metals into gold miscarried in all their experiments The whole evaporated in smoke without leaving so much as the scrapings of a crucible for a specific against the itch Tickets made of a kind of bamboo had been long used to reinforce the circulation of Japan but these were of no use in Tartary the mercenaries and allies of that country would receive nothing but gold  and silver which indeed one would imagine they had a particular method of decomposing or annihilating for of all the millions transported thither not one copan was ever known to revisit Japan  "It was a country as Hamlet says from whose bourn no travelling copan e'er returned"  As the war of Yesso therefore engrossed all the specie of Niphon and some currency was absolutely necessary to the subsistence of the Japonese the orator contrived a method to save the expence of solid food He composed a mess that should fill their bellies and at the same time protract the intoxication of their brains which it was so much his interest to maintainHe put them upon a diet of yeast where this did not agree with the stomach he employed his emissaries to blow up the patients  à posteriori  as the dog was blown up by the madman of Seville recorded by Cervantes  The individuals thus inflated were seen swaggering about the streets smooth and round and sleek and jolly with leering eyes and florid complexion Every one seemed to have the  os magna sonaturum  He strutted with an air of importance He broke wind and broached new systems He declared as if by revelation that the more debt the public owed the richer it became that food was not necessary to the support of life nor an intercourse of the sexes required for the propagation of the species He expatiated on yeast as the nectar of the gods that would sustain the animal machine fill the human mind with divine inspiration and confer immortality From the efficacy of this specific he began to prophesy concerning the White Horse and declared himself an apostle of BupoThus they strolled through the  island of Niphon barking and preaching the gospel of Fakkubasi and presenting their barm goblets to all who were in quest of political salvation The people had been so well prepared for infatuation by the speeches of Taycho and the tidings of success from Tartary that every passenger greedily swallowed the drench and in a little time the whole nation was converted that is they were totally freed from those troublesome and impertinent faculties of reason and reflection which could have served no other purpose but to make them miserable under the burthens to which their backs were now subjected They offered up all their gold and silver their jewels their furniture and apparel at the shrine of Fakkubasi singing psalms and hymns in praise of the White Horse They put arms into the hands of their children and drove them into Tartary  in order to fatten the land of Yesso with their blood They grew fanatics in that cause and worshipped Brutantiffi as the favourite prophet of the beatified Bupo All was staggering staring incoherence and contortion exclamation and eructation Still this was no more than a temporary delirium which might vanish as the intoxicating effects of the yeast subsided Taycho therefore called in two reinforcements to the drench He resolved to satiate their appetite for blood and to amuse their infantine vanity with the gewgaws of triumph He equipped out one armament at a considerable expence to make a descent on the coast of China and sent another at a much greater to fight the enemy in Fatsisio The commander of the first disembarked upon a desolate island demolished an unfinished cottage and brought away a few bunches of  wild grapes He afterwards hovered on the Chinese coast but was deterred from landing by a very singular phaenomenon In surveying the shore through spyingglasses he perceived the whole beach instantaneously fortified as it were with parapets of sand which had escaped the naked eye and at one particular part there appeared a body of giants with very hideous features peeping as it were from behind those parapets from which circumstances the Japonese general concluded there was a very formidable ambuscade which he thought it would be madness to encounter and even folly to ascertain One would imagine he had seen Homer's account of the Cyclops and did not think himself safe even at the distance of some miles from the shore for he pressed the commander of the Fune to weigh anchor immediately and retire to a  place of more safetyI shall now Peacock let you into the whole secret This great officer was deceived by the carelessness of the commissary who instead of perspectives had furnished him with glasses peculiar to Japan that magnified and multiplied objects at the same time They are called PhoberontiaThe large parapets of sand were a couple of molehills and the gigantic faces of grim aspect were the posteriors of an old woman sacrificing  sub dio  to the powers of digestionThere was another circumstance which tended to the miscarriage of this favourite expeditionThe principal design was against a trading town situated on a navigable river and at the place where this river disembogued itself into the sea there was a Chinese fort called Sarouf The admiral of the Fune sent the second in command whose name  was Seluon to lay this fort in ashes that the embarkation might pass without let or molestation A Chinese pilot offered to bring his junk within a cablelength of the walls but he trusted to the light of his own penetration He ran his junk aground and solemnly declared there was not water sufficient to float any vessel of force within three miles of Sarouf This discovery he had made by sounding and it proved two very surprising paradoxes first that the Chinese junks drew little or no water otherwise they could not have arrived at the town where they were laid up secondly that the fort Sarouf was raised in a spot where it neither could offend nor be offended But the Seyseogun Seluon was a mighty man for paradoxes His superior in command was a plain man who did not understand these niceties he therefore grumbled  and began to be troublesome upon which a council of war was held and he being overruled by a majority of voices the whole embarkation returned to Niphon  re infecta  You have been told how the beast called Legion brayed and bellowed and kicked when the fate of Byngoh's expedition was known it was disposed to be very unruly at the return of this armament but Taycho lulled it with a double dose of his Mandragora It growled at the giants the sandhills and the paradoxes of Seluon then brayed aloud  Taycho for ever  rolled itself up like a lubberly hydra yawned and fell fast asleepThe other armament equipped for the operations in Fatsisio did not arrive at the place of destination till the opportunity for action was lost The object was the reduction of a town and island belonging to the Chinese but before  the Fune with the troops arrived from Niphon the enemy having received intimation of their design had reinforced the garrison and harbour with a greater number of forces and Fune than the Japonese commander could bring against them He therefore wisely declined an enterprize which must have ended in his own disgrace and destruction The Chinese were successful in other parts of Fatsisio They demolished some forts they defeated some parties and massacred some people belonging to the colonies of Japan Perhaps the tidings of these disasters would have roused the people of Niphon from the lethargy of intoxication in which they were overwhelmed had not their delirium been keept up by some fascinating amulets from Tartary these were no other than the bubbles which Brutantiffi swelled into mighty  victories over the Chinese and Ostrog though in fact he had been severely cudgelled and more than once in very great danger of crucifixion Taycho presented the monster with a bowl of blood which he told it this invincible ally had drawn from its enemies the Chinese and at the same time blowed the gay bubbles athwart its numerous eyes The hydra lapped the gore with signs of infinite relish groaned and grunted to see the bubbles dance exclaimed  "O rare Taycho"  and relapsed into the arms of slumber Thus passed the first campaign of Taycho's administration  By this time Fikakaka was fully convinced that the orator actually dealt with the devil and had even sold him his soul for this power of working miracles on the understanding of the populace He began to be invaded with fears that the same  consideration would be demanded of him for the ease and pleasure he now enjoyed in partnership with that magician He no longer heard himself scoffed ridiculed and reviled in the assemblies of the people He no longer saw his measures thwarted nor his person treated with disdain He no longer racked his brains for pretences to extort money nor trembled with terror when he used these pretences to the public The mouth of the opposition was now glewed to his own posteriors Many a time and often when he heard orator Tycho declaiming against him from his rostrum he cursed him in his heart and was known to ejaculate  "Kiss my ase Taycho"  but little did he think the orator would one day stoop to this compliance He now saw that insolent foulmouthed demagogue ministring with the utmost servility to his pleasure  and ambition He filled his bags with the treasures of Japan as if by inchantment so that he could now gratify his own profuse temper without stint or controul He took upon himself the whole charge of the administration and left Fikakaka to the full enjoyment of his own sensuality thus divested of all its thorns It was the contemplation of these circumstances which inspired the Cuboy with a belief that the devil was concerned in producing this astonishing calm of felicity and that his infernal highness would require of him some extraordinary sacrifice for the extraordinary favours he bestowed He could not help suspecting the sincerity of Taycho's attachment because it seemed altogether unnatural and if his soul was to be the sacrifice he wished to treat with Satan as a principal Full of this idea he had recourse to his  Bonzes as the most likely persons to procure him such an interview with the prince of darkness as should not be attended with immediate danger to his corporeal parts but upon enquiry he found there was not one conjurer among them all Some of them made a merit of their ignorance pretending they could not in conscience give application to an art which must have led them into communication with demons others insisted there was no such thing as the devil and this opinion seemed to be much relished by the Cuboy the rest frankly owned they knew nothing at all of the matter For my part Peacock I not only know there is a devil but I likewise know that he has marked out nineteen twentieths of the people of this metropolis for his preyHow now You shake sirrahYou have some reason considering the experiments  you have been trying in the way of sorcery turning the sieve and sheers mumbling gibberish over a goose's liver stuck with pins pricking your thumbs and writing mystical characters with your blood forming spells with sticks laid across reading prayers backwards and invoking the devil by the name style and title of  Sathan Abrasax Adonai  I know what communication you had with goody Thrusk at Camberwell who undertook for three shillings and fourpence to convey you on a broomstick to Norway where the devil was to hold a conventicle but you boggled at crossing the sea without such security for your person as the beldame could not give I remember your poring over the treatise  De volucri arborea  until you had wellnigh lost your wits and your intention to enrol yourself in the Rosicrusian society until your intrigue  with the tripewoman in Thievinglane destroyed your pretensions to chastity Then you cloaked your own wickedness with an affectation of scepticism and declared there never was any such existence as devil demon spirit or goblin nor any such art as magic necromancy sorcery or witchcraftO infidel hast thou never heard of the three divisions of magic into natural artificial and diabolical The first of these is no more than medicine hence the same word Pharmacopola signified both a wiseacre and apothecary To the second belong the glass sphere of Archimedes the flying wooden pigeon of Archytus the emperor Leo's singing birds of gold Boetius the Consolator's flying birds of brass hissing serpents of the same metal and the famous speaking head of Albertus Magnus The last which we call diabolical depends upon the  evocation of spirits such was the art exercised by the magicians of Pharaoh as well as by that conjurer recorded by Gaspar Peucerus who animated the dead carcase of a famous female harper in Bologna in such a manner that she played upon her instrument as well as ever she had done in her life until another magician removing the charm which had been placed in her armpits the body fell down deprived of all motion It is by such means that conjurers cure distempers with charms and amulets that according to St Isidore they confound the elements disturb the understanding slay without poison or any perceptible wound call up devils and learn from them how to torment their enemies Magic was known even to the ancient Romans Cato teaches us how to charm a dislocated bone by repeating these mystical words  Incipe  cantare in alto S F motas danata dardaries Astotaries dic una parite dum coeunt  c Besides the virtues of ABRACADABRA are well known though the meaning of the word has puzzled some of the best critics of the last age such as Wendelinus Scaliger Saumaise and father Kircher not to mention the ancient physician Serenus Sammonicus who describes the disposition of these characters in hexameter verse I might here launch out into a very learned dissertation to prove that this very Serenus formed the word ABRACADABRA from the Greek word  a name by which Basilides the Aegyptian heretic defined the Deity as the letters of it imply the number of days in the year This is the word still fair and legible on one of the two talismans found in the seventeenth century of which Baronius gives us the  figure in the second volume of his Annals By the bye Peacock you must take notice that the figure of St George encountering the dragon which is the symbol of the order of the Garter and at this day distinguishes so many inns taverns and alehouses in this kingdom was no other originally than the device of an abraxas or amulet wore by the Basilidians as a charm against infection for by the man on horseback killing the dragon was typified the sun purifying the air and dispersing the noxious vapours from the earth An abraxas marked with this device is exhibited by Montfaucon out of the Collection of Sig Capello This symbol improved by the cross on the top of the spear was afterwards adopted by the Christian crusards as a badge of their religious warfare as well as an amulet to ensure victory the cross alluding to Constantine's  labarum with the motto    "In this you shall conquer"  The figure on horseback they metamorphosed into St George the same with George the Arian who at one time was reckoned a martyr and maintained a place in the Roman Martyrology from which he and others were erased by pope Gelasius in the fifth century because the accounts of their martyrdom were written by heretics This very George while he officiated as bishop of Alexandria having ordered a temple of the god  Mythras  to be purified and converted into a Christian church found in the said temple this emblem of the sun which the Persians adored under the name of  Mythras  and with the addition of the cross metamorphosed it into a symbol of Christian warfare against idolatry It was on this occasion that the Pagans rose against George and murdered  him with the utmost barbarity and from this circumstance he became a saint and martyr and the amulet or abraxas became his badge of distinction The cross was considered as such a sure protection in battle that every swordhilt was made in this form and every warrior before he engaged kissed it in token of devotion hence the phrase  "I kiss your hilt"  which is sometimes used even at this day With respect to the mystical words ΑΒRΑCΑΣ ΙΑΩ ΔΟΩΝΑΙ which are found upon those amulets and supposed to be of Hebrew extract tho' in the Greek character of termination if thou wouldst know their real signification thou mayest consult the learned De Croy in his Treatise concerning the genealogies of the  Gnostics  Thou wilt find it at the end of St Irenaeus's works published by Grabius at Oxford  But to return to magic thou must have heard of the famous Albertus Magnus de Bolstadt who indifferently exercised the professions of conjurer bawd and manmidwife who forged the celebrated  Androides  or brazenhead which pronounced oracles and solved questions of the utmost difficulty nor can the fame of Henry Cornelius Agrippa have escaped thee he who wrote the Treatises  De occulta Philosophia de caecis Ceremoniis  who kept his demon secured with an inchanted iron collar in the shape of a black dog which black dog being dismissed in his last moments with these words  Abi perdita bestia quae me totum perdidisti  plunged itself in the river Soame and immediately disappeared But what need of those profane instances to prove the existence of magicians who held communication  with the devil Don't we read in the scripture of the magicians of Pharaoh and Manasses of the witch of Endor of Simon and Barjesus magicians and of that sorceress of whose body the apostle Paul dispossessed the devil Have not the fathers mentioned magicians and sorcerers Have not different councils denounced anathemas against them Hath not the civil law decreed punishments to be inflicted upon those convicted of the black art Have not all the tribunals in France England and particularly in Scotland condemned many persons to the stake for sorceries on the fullest evidence nay even on their own confession Thou thyself mayest almost remember the havock that was made among the sorcerers in one of the English colonies in NorthAmerica by Dr Encrease Mather and Dr Cotton Mather those luminaries  of the NewEngland church under the authority and auspices of Sir William Phipps that flower of knighthood and mirror of governors who not contented with living witnesses called in the assistance of spectral evidence to the conviction of those diabolical delinquentsThis was a hint indeed which he borrowed from the famous trial of Urban Grandier canon of Loudun in France who was duly convicted of magic upon the depositions of the devils  Astaroth Eusas Celsus Acaos Cedon Asinodeus Alix Zabulon Nephthalim Cham Uriel  and  Acbas  I might likewise refer thee to king James's History of Witchcraft wherein it appears upon uncontrovertible evidence that the devil not only presided in person at the assemblies of those wise women but even condescended to be facetious and often diverted them by dancing and  playing gambols with a lighted candle in his breech I might bid thee recollect the authenticated account of the earl of Gowry's conspiracy against the said king in which appears the deposition of a certain person certifying that the earl of Gowry had studied the black art that he wore an amulet about his person of such efficacy that although he was run several times through the body not one drop of blood flowed from the wounds until those mystical characters were removedFinally I could fill whole volumes with undeniable facts to prove the existence of magic but what I have said shall suffice I must only repeat it again that there was not one magician conjurer wizard or witch among all the Bonzes of Japan whom the Cuboy consulted a circumstance that astonished him the more as divers of them notwithstanding  their beards were shrewdly suspected to be old women and 'till that time an old woman with a beard upon her chin had been always considered as an agent of the devilIt was the nature of Fikakaka to be impatient and impetuous Perceiving that none of his Bonzes had any communication with the devil and that many of them doubted whether there was any such personage as the devil he began to have some doubts about his own soul  "For if there is no devil said he there is no soul to be damned and it would be a reproach to the justice of heaven to suppose that all souls are to be saved considering what rascally stuff mankind are made of"  This was an inference which gave him great disturbance for he was one of those who would rather encounter eternal damnation than run any risque of  being annihilated He therefore assembled all those among the Bonzes who had the reputation of being great philosophers and metaphysicians in order to hear their opinions concerning the nature of the soul The first reverend sage who delivered himself on this mysterious subject having stroked his grey beard and hemmed thrice with great solemnity declared that the soul was an animal a second pronounced it to be the number  three  or proportion a third contended for the number  seven  or harmony a fourth defined the soul the  universe  a fifth affirmed it was a mixture of elements a sixth asserted it was composed of  fire  a seventh opined it was formed of  water  an eighth called it an  essence  a ninth an idea a tenth stickled for  substance without extension  an eleventh for  extension without substance  a twelfth cried it  was an  accident  a thirteenth called it a  reflecting mirrour  a fourteenth the  image reflected  a fifteenth insisted upon its being a  tune  a sixteenth believed it was the instrument that played the tune a seventeenth undertook to prove it was  material  an eighteenth exclaimed it was  immaterial  a nineteenth allowed it was  something  and a twentieth swore it was  nothing  By this time all the individuals that composed this learned assembly spoke together with equal eagerness and vociferation The volubility with which a great number of abstruse and unintelligible terms and definitions were pronounced and repeated not only resembled the confusion of Babel but they had just the same effect upon the brain of Fikakaka as is generally produced in weak heads by looking stedfastly at a millwheel or a vortex or any other object  in continual rotation He grew giddy ran three times round and dropped down in the midst of the Bonzes deprived of sense and motion When he recovered so far as to be able to reflect upon what had happened he was greatly disturbed with the terror of annihilation as he had heard nothing said in the consultation which could give him any reason to believe there was such a thing as an immortal soul In this emergency he sent for his counsellor Muraclami and when that lawyer entered his chamber exclaimed  "My dear Mura as I have a soul to be savedA soul to be saveday there's the rubthe devil a soul have IThose Bonzes are good for nothing but to kiss my asea parcel of ignorant assesPox on their philosophy Instead of demonstrating the immortality of the soul they have plainly  proved the soul is a chimaera a will o' the wisp a bubble a term a word a nothingMy dear Mura prove but that I have a soul and I shall be contented to be damned to all eternity""If that be the case said the other your Quambucuship may set your heart at rest for if you proceed to govern this empire in conjunction with Taycho as you have begun it will become a point of eternal justice to give you an immortal soul if you have not one already that you may undergo eternal punishment according to your demerits"  The Cuboy was much comforted by this assurance and returned to his former occupations with redoubled ardour He continued to confer benefices on his backfriends the Bonzes to regulate the whole army of taxgatherers to bribe the tribunes the centurions the decuriones and all the inferior mobdrivers of the  empire to hire those pipers who were best skilled in making the multitude dance and find out the ablest artists to scratch their long ears and tickle their noses These toils were sweetened by a variety of enjoyments He possessed all the pomp of oftentation the vanity of levees the pride of power the pleasure of adulation the happiness of being kicked by his sovereign and kissed by his Bonzes and above all the delights of the stomach and the closestool which recurred in perpetual succession and which he seemed to enjoy with a particular relish for it must be observed to the honour of Fikakaka that what he eagerly received at one end he as liberally refunded at the other But as the faculties of his mind were insufficient to digest the great mess of power which had fallen to his share so were the organs of his body unable to concoct the  enormous mass of aliments which he so greedily swallowed He laboured under an indigestion of both and the vague promises which went upwards as well as the murmurs that passed the other way were no other than eruptive crudities arising from the defects of his soul and body  As for Taycho he confined himself to the management of the war He recalled the general in chief from Fatsisio because he had not done that which he could not possibly do but instead of sending another on whose abilities he could depend he allowed the direction of the armaments to devolve upon the second in command whose character he could not possibly know because indeed he was too obscure to have any character at all The fruits of his sagacity soon appeared The new general Abramoria having reconnoitred a post of the enemy which was found  too strong to be forced attacked it without hesitation and his troops were repulsed and routed with considerable slaughter It was lucky for Taycho that the tidings of this disaster were qualified by the news of two other advantages which the arms of Japan had gainedA separate corps of troops under Yaffrai and Yaloff reduced a strong Chinese fortress in the neighbourhood of Fatsisio and a body of Japonese headed by a factor called Kaliff obtained a considerable victory at Flasao in the farther extremity of Tartary where a trading company of Meaco possessed a commercial settlement The Hydra of Meaco began to shake its numerous heads and growl when it heard of Abramoria's defeat At that instant one of its leaders exclaimed  "Bless thy long ears It was not Taycho that recommended Abramoria to this  command He was appointed by the Fatzman"  This was true It was likewise true that Taycho had allowed him quietly to succeed to the command without knowing any thing of his abilitiesit was equally true that Taycho was an utter stranger to Yaffrai and Yaloff who took the fortress as well as to the factor Kaliff who obtained the victory at the farther end of TartaryNevertheless the beast cried aloud "Hang Abramoria and a fig for the Fatzman But let the praise of Taycho be magnified It was Taycho that subdued the fortress in the Isle Kafrito It was Taycho that defeated the enemy at FlasaoYaffrai has slain his thousandsYaloff has slain his five thousandsbut Taycho had slain his ten thousands  Taycho had credit not only for the success of the Japonese arms but likewise  for the victories of Brutantiffi who had lately been much beholden to fortune I have already observed what a noise that Tartar made when the Fatzman of Japan found himself obliged to capitulate with the Chinese general In consequence of that event the war was already at an end with respect to the Japonese on the continent of Tartary The emperor of China took possession of the farm of Yesso the peasants quietly submitted to their new masters and those very freebooting Tartar chiefs who had sold their subjects as soldiers to serve under the Fatzman had already agreed to send the very same mercenaries into the army of China It was at this juncture that Brutantiffi exalted his throat In the preceding campaign he had fought with various success One of his generals had given battle to the Mantchoux Tartars and each side claimed  the victory Another of his leaders had been defeated and taken by the Ostrog The Chinese had already advanced to the frontiers of Brutantiffi's dominions In this dilemma he exerted himself with equal activity and address he repulsed the Chinese army with considerable loss and in the space of one month after this action gained a victory over the general of the Ostrog These advantages rendered him insufferably arrogant He exclaimed against the Fatzman he threatened the Dairo and as I have taken notice above a new army was raised at the expence of Japan to defend him from all future invasions of the Chinese Already the Tartar general Bronxitic who was vested at his desire with the command of the mercenary army of Japan had given a severe check to a strong body of the Chinese and even threatened to carry the war into the empire of  China but his progress was soon stopt and he was forced to retreat in his turn towards the farm of YessoBut from nothing did orator Taycho reap a fuller harvest of praise than from the conquest of Tzinkhall a settlement of the Chinese on the coast of Terra Australis which conquest was planned by a Banyan merchant of Meaco who had traded on that coast and was particularly known to the king of the country This royal savage was uneasy at the neighbourhood of the Chinese and conjured the merchant whose name was ThumKhummqua to use his influence at the court of Meaco that an armament should be equipped against the settlement of Tzinkhall he himself solemnly promising to cooperate in the reduction of it with all his forcesThumKhummqua whose zeal for the good of his country got the better of all his  prudential maxims did not fail to represent this object in the most interesting points of view He demonstrated to Taycho the importance of the settlement that it abounded with slaves ivory gold and a precious gum which was not to be found in any other part of the world a gum in great request all over Asia and particularly among the Japonese who were obliged to purchase it in time of war at secondhand from their enemies the Chinese at an exorbitant price He demonstrated that the loss of this settlement would be a terrible wound to the emperor of China and proved that the conquest of it could be atchieved at a very trifling expence He did more Tho' by the maxims of his sect he was restrained from engaging in any military enterprize he offered to conduct the armament in person in order the more effectually to keep  the king of the country steady to his engagements Though the scheme was in itself plausible and practicable Mr orator Taycho shuffled and equivocated until the season for action was past But ThumKhummqua was indefatigable He exhorted he pressed he remonstrated he complained and besieged the orator's house in such a manner that Taycho at length in order to be rid of his importunity granted his request A small armament was fitted out the Banyan embarked in it leaving his own private affairs in confusion and the settlement was reduced according to his prediction When the news of this conquest arrived at Meaco the multifarious beast brayed hoarse applause and the minister Taycho was magnified exceedingly As for ThumKhummqua whose private fortune was consumed in the expedition all  the recompence he received was the consciousness of having served his country In vain he reminded Taycho of his promises in vain he recited the minister's own letters in which he had given his word that the Banyan should be liberally rewarded according to the importance of his services Taycho was both deaf and blind to all his remonstrances and representations and at last fairly flung the door in his face  Such was the candour and the gratitude of the incomparable TaychoThe poor projector ThumKhummqua found himself in a piteous case while the whole nation resounded with joy for the conquest which his sagacity had planned and his zeal carried into execution He was not only abandoned by the minister Taycho but also renounced by the whole sect of the Banyans who looked upon him as a wicked apostate  because he had been concerned with those who fought with the arm of flesh It was lucky for him that he afterwards found favour with a subsequent minister who had not adopted all the maxims of his predecessor TaychoThe only measures which this egregious demagogue could hitherto properly call his own were these His subsidiary treaty with Brutantiffi his raising an immense army of mercenaries to act in Tartary for the benefit of that prince his exacting an incredible sum of money from the people of Japan and finally two successive armaments which he had sent to annoy the seacoast of China I have already given an account of the first the intent of which was frustrated by a mistake in the perspectives The other was more fortunate in the beginning Taycho had by the force of his genius discovered that  nothing so effectually destroyed the oiled paper which the Chinese use in their windows instead of glass as the gold coin called Oban when discharged from a military engine at a proper distance He found that gold was more compact more heavy more malleable and more manageable than any other metal or substance that he knew he therefore provided a great quantity of obans and a good body of  lingers and these being conveyed to the coast of China in a squadron of Fune as none of the Chinese appeared to oppose these hostilities a select number of the troops were employed to make ducks and drakes with the obans on the supposition that this diversion would allure the enemy to the seaside where they might be knocked on the head without further trouble but the care of their own safety got the better of their curiosity on this occasion and  fifty thousand obans were expended in this manner without bringing one Chinese from his lurkinghole Considerable damage was done to the windows of the enemy Then the forces were landed in a village which they found deserted Here they burned some fishingboats and from hence they carried off some military machines which were brought to Meaco and conveyed through the streets in procession amidst the acclamations of the Hydra who sung the praise of TaychoElevated by this triumph the minister sent forth the same armament a second time under a new general of his own choosing whose name was Hylibbib who had long entertained an opinion that the inhabitants of China were not beings of flesh and blood but mere fantastic shadows who could neither offend nor be offended Full of this opinion  he made a descent on the coast of that empire and to convince his followers that his notion was right he advanced some leagues into the country without having taken any precautions to secure a retreat leaving the Fune at anchor upon an open beach Some people alledged that he depended upon the sagacity of an engineer recommended to him by Taycho which engineer had such an excellent nose that he could smell a Chinese at the distance of ten leagues but it seems the scent failed him at this juncture Perhaps the Chinese general had trailed rusty bacon and other odoriferous substances to confound his sense of smelling Perhaps no dew had fallen over night and a strong breeze blew towards the enemy Certain it is Hylibbib in the evening received repeated intelligence that he was within half a league of a Chinese  general at the head of a body of troops greatly superior in number to the Japonese forces which he himself commanded He still believed it was all illusion and when he heard their drums beat declared it was no more than a ridiculous inchantment He thought proper however to retreat towards the seaside but this he did with great deliberation after having given the enemy fair notice by beat of drum His motions were so slow that he took seven hours to march three miles When he reached the shore where the Fune were at anchor he saw the whole body of the Chinese drawn up on a rising ground ready to begin the attack He ordered his rearguard to face about on the supposition that the phantoms would disappear as soon as they shewed their faces but finding himself mistaken and perceiving some of his own people  to drop in consequence of missiles that came from the enemy he very calmly embarked with his van leaving his rear to amuse the Chinese by whom they were in less than five minutes either massacred or taken From this small disgrace the general deduced two important corollaries first that the Chinese were actually material beings capable of impulsion and secondly that his engineer's nose was not altogether infallible The people of Meaco did not seem to relish the experiments by which these ideas were ascertained The monster was heard to grunt in different streets of the metropolis and these notes of discontent produced the usual effect in the bowels of Fikakaka but orator Taycho had his flowers of rhetoric and his bowl of mandragora in readiness He assured them that Hylibbib should be employed for the  future in keeping sheep on the island of Xicoco and the engineer be sent to hunt truffles on the mountains of Ximo Then he tendered his dose which the Hydra swallowed with signs of pleasure and lastly he mounted upon its back and rode in triumph under the windows of the astonished Cuboy who while he shifted his trowsers exclaimed in a rapture of joy  "All hail Taycho thou prince of monstertaming men the Dairo shall kick thy posteriors and I will kiss them in token of approbation and applause"  END of the FIRST VOLUME
