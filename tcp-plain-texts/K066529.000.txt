 OBSERVATIONS ON SOAME JENYNS'S VIEW OF THE INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION ADDRESSED TO ITS ALMOSTCHRISTIAN AUTHOR BY W KENRICK LL D  I would to God that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both  almost  and  altogether  Christians  PAUL TO AGRIPPA  LONDON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD BY T EVANS PATERNOSTER ROW AND G CORRALL CATHERINESTREET STRAND M DCC LXXVI  TO SOAME JENYNS ESQ  SIR  APOLOGIES for the liberties we take with individuals when the interests of all mankind are at stake are as frivolous as they are impertinent I shall make none therefore for such as are taken in the following  Observations  on your late  View of the Internal Evidence of the Christian Religion  The subject indeed is of such high debate and its design of such superior dignity that even the decency of decorum requires the banishment of unmeaning ceremony  St Paul  tho a prisoner and in bonds stood upon none even with  King Agrippa  on his judgmentseat when on the presumption of that princely personage's being  almost  a Christian he wished that not only he but all his hearers were  altogether  such  Whether my arguments are sufficiently forcible or are properly calculated to be in any degree instrumental to the accomplishment of a similar wish must be determined by their influence on my readers among whom I presume Sir you will be one of the most respectable Whatever be the result therefore I shall add to the other liberties I have taken that of congratulating you who once confessedly  believed as little as others  on the promising progress you have already made in becoming  almost  what I confidently trust you will thro superior influence sooner or later  altogether  be a CHRISTIAN as far as is consistent with which character  I am Sir Your most obedient Humble Servant W KENRICK  ADVERTISEMENT  THE extraordinary demand for the  Appendix  to the third volume of the  London  Review in which a  slight sketch  of the following  Observations  was first printed having suggested to the author that their republication in a more commodious form would be acceptable to the Public he was led to a more considerate revisal of the tract which gave rise to them The slips and inadvertencies which appeared on such revisal to have escaped him in the hurry of composition acquiring consequence from the importance of the subject urged also a kind of necessity for such republication  The desire of atoning for the defects of that hasty critique induced him therefore to enlarge on the more interesting parts of the  View  and to digest the whole of his  Observations  on it into a more methodical and regular form  The  Observer  was the more readily induced to this by an apparent deficiency of method in Mr Jenyns's tract though professedly calculated for the perusal of "the  Busy  and the  Idle"  who may be comprized under those who have but little time to read and those who read but little at a time for whose convenience therefore the matter is here so managed by a proper subdivision of the subject that the reader be he as  busy  or as  idle  as he will may take up or lay down the book at pleasure without running any risk of losing without recovery the thread of its argument  CONTENTS  SECT I  On the subject scope and design of the writer's argument in general  viz  To prove the  truth  by demonstrating the  divine origin  of the Christian Religion    The most convincing proofs pretended to amount but to a mere probability  Page  SECT II  On the definition of the subject and division of the argument into four propositions The first  "That there is now extant a book entitled the New Testament"  shewn to be futile and frivolous  Page  SECT III  On the second proposition  viz  That from this book may be extracted a system of religion entirely new both with regard to the object and the doctrines not only superior to but unlike every thing which had ever before entered the human mind    This proposition shewn to be very obscurely illustrated inconsistently explained and even of little consequence to the general argument were it capable of being proved  Page  SECT IV  On the third proposition  That from this book may likewise be collected a system  of Ethicks in which every moral precept founded on reason is carried to a higher degree of perfection than in any other of the wisest philosophers of preceding ages every precept founded on false principles is totally omitted and many new precepts added peculiarly corresponding with the new object of this religion    This proposition shewn to be very exceptionably illustrated affording at best rather a proof of the sublimity and purity of Christian morals and of the  advantages  rather than the  truth  of the Christian religion  Page  SECT V  On the fourth or conclusive proposition  That such a system of religion and morality could not possibly have been the work of any man or set of men much less of those obscure and illiterate persons who actually did discover and publish it to the world and that therefore it must undoubtedly have been effected by the interposition of divine power that is it must derive its origin from God    This proposition shewn to contain only corollaries of the preceeding propositions and though true as to fact and therefore admitted  ex gratia  still problematical in argument  Page  SECT VI  On the writer's general conclusions and his notions concerning the essential objects of the Christian faithTill these objects are precisely determined the determination of the question respecting their divine origin of little importance  Page  SECT VII  On the objections that have been made to the divinity and veracity of the Christian religion and particularly to objection the  FIRST  viz  That divine Revelation is incredible because unnecessary because the reason which God has bestowed on mankind is sufficiently able to discover all the religious and moral duties which he requires of them if they will but attend to her precepts and be guided by her friendly admonitions    This objection shewn to be neither properly stated nor satisfactorily removed  Page  SECT VIII  On his reply to a second objection  That the Old and New Testament cannot be a revelation from God because in them are to be found errors and inconsistencies fabulous stories false facts and false philosophy which can never be derived from the Fountain of all  Truth    This objection shewn to be rather enforced by the author's concessions than removed by his conclusions  Page  SECT IX  On his reply to a third objection  That a wise and benevolent Creator should have constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another  Under the term  religion  in this objection the author is shewn to include  morals  also but the purity of the Christian morals is shewn not to be calculated for the constitution of this world and therefore not required of Christians in their present state of probation  Page  SECT X  On his reply to a fourth objection  That if this revelation had really been from God his infinite power and goodness could never have suffered it to have been so soon perverted from its original purity to have continued in a state of corruption through the course of so many ages and at last to have proved so ineffectual to the reformation of mankind    The manner in which this objection is attempted to be removed shewn to reflect the highest indignity on the divine Author of the Christian religion as well as on that religion itself  Page  SECT XI  On his reply to the fifth objection  The incredibility of some of its doctrines particularly those concerning the Trinity and atonement for sin by the sufferings and death of Christ the one contradicting all the principles of human reason and the other all our ideas of natural justice    This objection shewn to be rather evaded than solved the author not having fairly and fully stated the difficulties it really contains  Page  SECT XII  On his reply to the sixth objection  That however true these doctrines may be yet it must be inconsistent with the justice and goodness of the Creator to require from his creatures the belief of propositions which contradict or are above the reach of that reason which he has thought proper to bestow on them    This objection answered by denying that genuine Christianity requires any such beliefThe nature of the Christian faith investigated and its latitude defined Christianity as it requires nothing  impracticable  to be  performed  so it requires nothing  impossible  to be  believed Page  ECT XIII  On his reply to the seventh objection  That the whole scheme of Revelation is partial false fluctuating unjust and unworthy of an omniscient and omnipotent Author  Page  SECT XIV  General Reflections on the whole argument and conclusion in favour of universal candour in judging of the faith and morals of others or the exertion of Christian charity toward all mankind  Page  OBSERVATIONS ON A VIEW Of THE INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION  SECT I  On the subject scope and design of the writer's argument in general  viz  To prove the  truth  by demonstrating the  divine origin  of the Christian Religion  The most convincing proofs pretended to amount but to a mere probability  AMONG the many attempts to recommend and accommodate the profound mysteries of  divine wisdom  to the shallow comprehension of the  human understanding  the present is by no means the least promising or plausible  But the  Impossible  necessarily includes the  Impracticable  and all attempts to reconcile objects that are in their very essence irreconcileable must ever be ineffectual  In pride in  reasoning  pride our errour lies  All quit their sphere and rush into the skies  Aspiring to be gods if angels fell  Aspiring to be angels men rebel  Hence nothing can be more reprehensible than the arrogance of our modern  Rationalists  in cavilling at every thing in  Revelation  that is not reconcileable to  Reason  and in denying every thing to be  religious  that is not  rational  Tenacious of the  name  of  Christians  as they are of the  principles  of  Heathens  they want to newmodel the system of  Christianity  by expunging all those doctrines which they cannot reconcile to their newsangled scheme of  Rationality  But  alas their reasoning faculties are too confined to soar above  this visible diurnal sphere  so that after all they must sit down content with a religion which entitles them to no better an appellation than that of honest heathens or give up even their  nominal  title to Christianity and honestly confess themselves real  Infidels  Let them  chuse  but the time seems to be approaching when they must make their choice The Christian world is no longer to be deceived by these wolves in sheep's cloathing these believers in the  name  of a  Saviour  whose  power  of  salvation  they openly deny  There is so much disingenuousness and sophistry in the practices of these  minute philosophers  that we are particularly sorry to see them kept in countenance by the misapplied abilities of  more ingenious and ingenuous writers  It has indeed been publicly hinted that this little work is a mere controversial bubble blown up to amuse wellmeaning Christians in order to impose on their credulity and raise a sneer at the expence of their simplicity and sincerity  For our own part we have a better opinion of the author than to give credit to such a suggestion His rank and reputation in life as well as in literature forbid our entertaining a thought so derogatory to his character as a man of sense honour and probity For his  Christianity  it is true we have hitherto given him  credit  but as he now professes himself religiously solvent we shall take the liberty of investigating the terms of payment by a particular and impartial review of his present performance  Before we begin this investigation however it may not be amiss to enter a caveat against the reader's giving credit to the argument merely on the authority of the writer The good faith of the latter respects himself alone the validity of his reasoning only respects the reader  Should his work he says ever have the honour to be admitted into such good company as the  busy  or the  idle  they will immediately determine it to be that of some enthusiast or methodist son beggar or some madman "I shall therefore" says he  beg leave to assure them that the author is very far removed from all these characters that he  once perhaps believed as little as themselves  This intimation of our author's puts us in mind of old  Gresset  one of the  beauxesprits esprits  and as he long affected to be thought the  espritsforts  of France having outlived his  passions  and almost his  vanity  which is saying a great deal of a Frenchman he retired in disgust to a monastery and turned enthusiast alledging as the strongest proof of the propriety of his new creed the impropriety of his former infidelity  but  having some leisure and more curiosity he employed them both in resolving a question which seemed to him of some importance Whether Christianity was really an imposture founded on an absurd incredible and obsolete fable as many suppose it Or whether it is what it pretends to be a revelation communicated to mankind by the interposition of supernatural power On a candid enquiry he soon found that the first was an absolute impossibility and that its pretensions to  the latter were founded on the most solid grounds In the further pursuit of his examination he perceived at every step new lights arising and some of the brightest from parts of it the most obscure but productive of the clearest proofs because equally beyond the power of human artifice to invent and human reason to discover  That the  brightest lights  and  clearest proofs  Should arise from the  most obscure  parts of scripture is as singular as is the reason given for it viz  because they are beyond the power of human artifice to invent and human reason to discover  But may we not ask here how our author could assign so notable a reason without having himself carried human  artifice  and human  reason  to their utmost extent of  discovery  and  invention  How else  should he find this discovery and invention to be an  absolute impossibility  If indeed he meant to infinuate that he hath carried the powers of investigation so far as  this  well and good The improvements of  art  the  progress  of  science  are at an end But we must have stronger proof of the fact than a mere ipsedixit in a matter of so much importance  That it is of consequence to the reader to know that the author is not an  enthusiast  or a  madman  we admit but why we are told he is not a  methodist  or a  beggar  we do not readily conceive Is any doctrine the less true because it is taught by a methodist Is any argument the less valid because it is urged by a beggar Or would the same doctrine be more true if maintained by a metropolitan Or the same argument more valid if urged  by a NabobOur Saviour and his apostles were men of eminence neither in church nor state They were neither highpriests nor lords of trade neither men of credit nor men of fortune Nor do we see any incongruity in a very credible man's being a methodist and a very sound reasoner's being as poor as Job  It is more to the purpose that we are told the author is  not  an  enthusiast  or a madman But who tells us thisThe very man himselfAnd who ever took a man's own word for his not being in a state of insanity or intoxication"I drunk" says drunken Cassio in the play  No Sir This is my right hand and this is my left  at the same time mistaking one for the other  We do not say this is actually the case with our author but we say  that his own asseveration merely cannot be admitted as evidence to the contrary From his own confession it appears he is a convert from  infidelity  now all converts are apt to run into extremes and from excess of incredulity to become too credulous From doubting and disbelieving what is probably true they affect to believe what is palpably false Nay from denying almost every thing they come really to believe almost any thing  New Converts  we say are apt thro' inordinate zeal to give into excess of credulity a conduct which however pious certainly borders on Enthusiasm Indeed we cannot help thinking our author betrays a  little tincture  of it in his paradoxical observation respecting Divine Revelation in general when he says all circumstances considered  if it were in every  part  familiar  to our  understandings  and  consonant  to our  reason  we should have great cause to suspect its  divine authority  and therefore had this revelation been  less incomprehensible  it would certainly have been  more incredible    That is in plainer terms  If we  understood  it  more  we should be apt to  believe  it  less  Is not this on the plan of  Credo quia impossibile est  I believe it because it is impossible And does our author give this as a proof that he is in  no degree touched  with  enthusiasm  or  insanityCredat Judoeus Appella  We say not  haud nos  because Charity though it  feareth  all things  hopeth  all things  To prove the truth of the Christian religion  says he  we should begin by shewing the  internal marks  of Divinity which are  stamped upon  it  Should not a stamp  upon  a thing be rather called an  external  than  internal  mark  because on  this  the credibility of the prophecies and miracles  in a great measure  depends for if we have once  reason to be convinced  that this religion is derived from a supernatural origin prophecies and miracles will become so far from being incredible that it will be  highly probable  that a supernatural revelation should be foretold and inforced by supernatural means  Not that our author professedly means to depreciate the proofs of the truth of the Christian religion arising from either  prophecies  or  miracles  They both have or ought to have he says their proper weight Let us weigh them then in his own ballance  Prophecies  he says are  permanent miracles  whose authority is sufficiently  confirmed by their completion and are therefore solid proofs of the supernatural origin of a religion whose truth they were intended to justify such are those to be found in various parts of the scriptures relative to the coming of the Messiah the destruction of Jerusalem and the unexampled state in which the Jews have ever since continued all so circumstantially descriptive of the events that they seem rather histories of past than predictions of future transactions and whoever will seriously consider the immense distance of time between some of them and the events which they foretell the uninterrupted chain by which they are connected for many thousand years how exactly they correspond with those events and how totally unapplicable they are to all others in the  history of mankind I say whoever considers these circumstances he will scarcely be persuaded to believe that they can be the productions of preceding artifice or posterior application or can entertain the least doubt of their being derived from supernatural inspiration  Now this is so far from being true that we ourselves and we dare say many others have seriously considered all these circumstances and notwithstanding the pains ingenious interpreters have taken to develope conciliate and harmonize them we do still look upon them taken in a mere  rational view  to be so imperfectly ascertained and so doubtfully applied that judging of them merely from reason they do not strike us with any thing like that force of conviction which they appear to carry with our author  As to the miracles recorded in the New Testament to have been performed by Christ and his apostles he says  they were certainly convincing proofs of their divine commission to those who saw them and as they were seen by such numbers and are as well attested as other historical facts and above all as they were wrought on so great and so wonderful an occasion they must still be admitted as evidence of no inconsiderable force  Here again this writer either equivocates or sins against the truth The miracles performed by Christ and his Apostles were  not  certainly convincing proofs of their divine mission to  many  of those who saw them Witness our viour's dreadful denunciation to whole cities of impenitent unbelievers to Choraizin Bethsaida and Capernaum  in which his mighty works had been displayed unless indeed we are to suppose their  impenitency  not the consequence of their  unbelief  but that they were so much worse than the devils who believe and tremble in that  they  believed and trembled not But with the Scribes and Pharisees who seeing him work miracles immediately consulted to destroy him and said he cast out devils through  Beelzebub  the prince of devils were those miracles we say convincing proofs of his  divine  mission to  them  It even appears that our Saviour wrought his miracles and preached his doctrines in the sight and hearing of many who were never intended to be convinced by them This our author himself observes in accounting for that  want  of irresistible evidence of their truth by which they  might  possibly  have been enforced  quoting from the Evangelist Mark the following declaration of Jesus to his desciples "To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand and left at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them"  What weight or degree of force then doth our author give to the evidence of miracles Surely no considerable weight if he thinks as he says that  they must now depend for  much  of their credibility on the truth of that religion whose credibility they were at first intended to support  How are the  religion  and the  miracles  to be made reciprocally the criterion of each other Are the pillars of support on which the truth of Christianity hath so long rested to be now themselves supported by the strength and symmetry of its superstructure This is making the whole hang by  Geometry  indeed  The internal marks of the divine origin of Christianity are to give a credibility to the prophecies and miracles which  they  in turn are to reflect back on Christianity to do credit to its divine origin If this be not reasoning in a circle and beating round the bush of argument to no end we at least see no end to such a mode of argument It is like that of the world's being supported by an elephant the elephant by a tortoise the  tortoise by another elephant and the other elephant by another world  In regard to the prediction of prophecies and the working of miracles it may indeed be justly objected as it has often been that the completion of a prophecy or the performance of a miracle taken merely as a fact however wonderful does not necessarily infer the interposition of a  supernatural  agent  Think not Lorenzo Nature strays  Whene'er the world is in amaze  For say that miracles there be  May'nt they be only such to thee  So many links conceal'd remain  Which form the complicated chain  True causes and effects between  In Nature's providential scene  EP TO LORENZO  We shall take the liberty in the course of this critique to refer the reader more than once to the  Epistles to Lorenzo  not to indulge the vanity of an author in quoting from himself but to shew that the critick is  no new convert  being much of the same opinion respecting these matters after upwards of twenty years expence and reflection as he was of so long ago and at a very early period of life  But granting that it did and that such completion of the prophecies and performance of miracles are as well attested as other historical facts Such attestation they may have and yet if they have no more they cannot lay claim to more than a mere moral probability of truth  The difficulty of ascertaining the truth of probable and ordinary facts which happen daily almost under our immediate observation is so notorious that it is a sufficient caution against the putting implicit faith in the historical  relation of facts improbable and extraordinary which are said to have happened at such a considerable distance of time and place  The weight or degree of force therefore which our author gives to the evidence of prophecies must notwithstanding he stiles it  not inconsiderable  be little worth consideration  The utmost that he proposes indeed is a  high  probability and even this depends on our having other  reasons to be convinced  that Christianity is of divine origin A foundation itself far short of the necessary proof in some cases for men may often have reason to believe what is nevertheless not actually true  Even the  internal evidence  this writer attempts to investigate appears hence to amount to a mere  probability  so that by adding  this  evidence to  those  of both prophecies and miracles he is at best only adding one probability to another  SECT II  On the definition of the subject and division of the argument into four propositionsThe first  "That there is now extant a book entitled the New Testament"  shewn to be futile and frivolous  WHAT pure Christianity is says this writer divested of all its ornaments appendages and corruption I pretend not to say but what it is not will venture to affirm which is that it is not the offspring of fraud or fiction that however fraud and fiction may have grown up with it yet it never could have been grafted  on the same stock nor planted by the same hand  This our author undertakes to shew by stating the following plain and as he stiles them  undeniable  But if  undeniable  why all this trouble to state and explain them  propositions  First that there is now extant a book intitled the New Testament  Secondly that from this book may be extracted a system of religion intirely new both with regard to the object and the doctrines not only infinitely superior to but unlike every thing which had ever before entered into the mind of man  Thirdly that from this book may likewise be collected a system of ethics in which every moral precept founded on reason is carried to a higher degree of purity and perfection than in any other of the  wisest philosophers of preceding ages every moral precept founded on false principles is totally omitted and many new precepts added peculiarly corresponding with the new object of this religion  Lastly that such a system of religion and morality could not possibly have been the work of any man or set of men much less of those obscure ignorant and illiterate persons who actually did discover and publish it to the world and that therefore it must undoubtedly have been effected by the interposition of divine power that is that it must derive its origin from God  Such is this writer's plan as exhibited by himself on which we beg leave first to observe that the terms in which it is laid down are too vague and the style too metaphorical for a  logical essay the form of which it affects to assume  One would imagine that a casuist so rigid as to think it necessary to offer  the mere existence of a book entitled the New Testament  as a formal proposition would have been strict enough to set out with as formal a definition of the enthymeme or object itself in contemplation  The design in view is professedly  to prove the truth of the Christian religion  and yet  what pure christianity is divested of all its ornaments appendages and corruption the writer will not pretend to say  Does our logician then predicate nothing of his subjectYes though he will not pretend to say  what  pure christianity  is  he will venture to affirm  what  it  is not  His affirmation how ever is not even a negative predicate  of its essence or property but an assertion relative to its derivation  it is not the  offspring  of fraud or fiction    Fraud and fiction may have grown up with it yet it never could have been grafted upon the same stock nor planted by the same hand  These metaphorical expressions we say are ill adapted to the subject in hand which requires simple unequivocating and precise terms not liable to misconception or mistake We cannot help thinking it also extremely illogical to undertake to prove what any thing may be imputed to as its cause without being able to give some definition of the thing itself as an effect To affirm positively  what  and shew  whence  it is  not derived  without pretending to know what IT  is  is certainly not a very philosophical  however popular mode it may be of theological controversy  But to accommodate our  Review  to the  view  itself As to this proposition the  first  very little as the author hints need be said It is a plain fact which cannot be denied such writings do now exist the less need therefore as before observed to give it the formality of a proposition either to be proved or granted we pass it over therefore as futile and frivolous  SECT III  On the second proposition  viz  That from this book may be extracted a system of religion entirely new both with regard to the object and the doctrines not only superiour to but unlike every thing which had ever before entered the  human mind  This proposition shewn to be very obscurely illustrated inconsistently explained and even of little consequence to the general argument were it capable of being proved  MY  second  proposition says our author is not quite so simple but I think not less undeniable than the former and is this that from this book may be extracted a system of religion entirely new both with regard to the object and the doctrines not only infinitely superior to but totally unlike every thing which had ever before entered into the mind of man I say extracted because all the doctrines of this religion having been delivered at various times and on various occasions and here  only historically recorded  no uniform or regular system of theology is here  to be found and better perhaps it had been if less labour had been employed by the learned to bend and twist these divine materials into the polished forms of human systems to which they never will submit and for which they were never intended by their Great Author Why he chose not to leave any such behind him we know not but it might possibly be because he knew that the imperfection of man was incapable of receiving such a system and that we are more properly and more safely conducted by the distant and scattered rays than by the too powerful sunshine of divine illumination  Our author expresses himself here also in terms very vague and equivovocal  A system of religion he says may be extracted from the New  Testament infinitely superior  superior in what respect  to every other and yet no uniform or regular system of theology is to be found there and it had been better perhaps if the learned had never attempted to form such systems being  probably  incompatible with the divine oeconomy respecting mankind  Here is a  probability  suggested that is very  high  indeed He might almost as well have suggested that the divine oeconomy itself is not systematical  Equally paradoxical with a  former  illustration  See Page  also is the  present  As before the  brightest lights  arose from the most  obscure  parts of revelation so here we are to be more safely conducted in the  dark  than we should be in the  brightest sunshine  of divine illumination  There is likewise a palpable inconsistency on the very face of the proposition itself How can a system of religion be extracted from a book in which no such system is to be found Or means our author only that the  form  of that system is not to be found there But what of that Every doctrine that is  sound  must be  systematical  whether the declaration or explication of it be formally so or not  It is customary for writers either from literary incapacity or to save themselves trouble to deliver their sentiments however consistent and connected with each other in a loose unconnected and desultory manner Historians  Now I readily acknowledge says our author that the Scriptures are  not revelations  from God but the  history  of them See  View  page  in particular must from  the very nature of their composition blend doctrinal precepts with practical narration But if the precepts thus interspersed in the course of the narrative are inconsistent in themselves or incompatible with each other they can neither be truly doctrinal nor doctrinally true  Men may  write  as loosely and desultorily as they please but if they  think  justly they must think consistently and of course systematically Nor do we see the least reason except that of our author's desire to accommodate things at any rate to his own system for supposing that mankind are through any imperfection more incapable of receiving doctrines in a systematical form than they are of receiving them in no form at all As good a logician and as good a Christian as our author  tells us  the best way to learn  any science  is to begin with a  system  The late Dr Watts  As to this author's metaphorical allusion to the rays of light it elucidates nothing That a moderate portion of light is better adapted to weak optics than an excessive blaze of it is undoubtedly true but the supposition thence deduced of our seeing better by means of distant scattered rays than by a regular emanation is a rhetorical flourish altogether inconsistent with sound logic and true philosophy  In regard to the bending and twisting of the materials of divine revelation  into the  polished  forms of human systems to which they never will submit  the attempt so to twist and bend them is certainly an unjustifiable violence which it might have been better the learned had never made but this is no reasonable objection  to their forming a plain  unpolished  system such as is really contained in the Scriptures  Whether any  system  of scriptural  thinking  already reduced to  form in writing  be in all respects unexceptionable it is not our business here to enquire But if there be not it is in this particular we trace the source of imperfection it lies in the incapacity of men to form such a divine system to connect detached and desultory doctrines into a regular and consistent theory and not to their incapacity of comprehending such a theory had it been formally digested and in such form first given them  In respect to the total  novelty  and unheard of singularity of the doctrines of revelation when first promulgated our author  affirms  that those doctrines are equally  new with the object and  contain ideas of God and of man of the present and of a future life and of the relations which all these bear to each other totally unheard of and quite dissimilar from any which had ever been thought on previous to its publication  "But" continues he  Whether these wonderful doctrines which he enumerates are worthy of our belief must depend on the opinion which we entertain of the authority of those who published them to the world certain it is that they are all so far removed from every tract of the human imagination that it seems equally impossible that they should ever have been derived from the knowledge or artifice of man  Now to  us  there  seems  no such impossibility Even granting in opposition to the Son of Wisdom that there  is any thing new under the sun and that there is nothing in the tract entitled "Christianity as old as the creation" admitting we say that the Christian religion when promulgated by our Saviour was as  new  and  strange  as our author represents it we think little stress of argument is to be laid upon such singularity or novelty  We shall not go about to enquire whether the extravagancies of the Pagan Mythology many of which certainly bear  some  resemblance to the sublime mysteries of Christianity were of later or earlier origin Yet wonderful as are the latter and firmly as we believe them derived from God being in their  execution  superior to human comprehension and totally incompatible with human reason we do not see any thing merely in the  idea  or  design  of the sublimest of them so far superior to the  powers of human invention or dissimular to its sublimer conceptions On the contrary man hath made to himself so many inventions human genius hath soared so high into the region of impossibilities that nothing which can come within the association of the most incongruous ideas can in our opinion be justly said to exceed the artifice of the human imagination  And yet this appears to be all the  superiority  suggested  Both the object and the doctrines  says the author  are not only infinitely superior to but totally unlike every thing which had ever before  entered into the mind  of man  And again  the doctrines of this religion contain ideas c quite dissimilar from any which had ever been  thought on  previous to its publication  Thus it appears to be in the  thought  and not in the  deed  of the mystery of salvation that according to this writer the superiority contended for consists    To attend however a little to the author's mode of proving his proposition "To say the truth says he before the appearance of Christianity there existed  nothing like religion  on the face of the earth the Jewish only excepted all other nations were immersed in the grossest idolatry"  At this time Christianity broke forth from the east like a rising sun and dispelled this universal darkness which obscured every part of the globe and even at this day prevails in all those remoter regions to which its salutary influence has not as yet extended From all those which it has reached it has notwithstanding its corruptions banished all those enormities and introduced a more rational  tional devotion and purer morals It has taught men the unity and attributes of the supreme Being the remission of sins the resurrection of the dead life everlasting and the kingdom of heaven doctrines as inconceivable to the wisest of mankind antecedent to its appearance as the Newtonian system is at this day to the most ignorant tribes of savages in the wilds of America doctrines which human reason never could have discovered but which when discovered coincide with and are confirmed by it and which though beyond the reach of all the learning and penetration of Plato Aristotle and Cicero are now clearly laid open to the eye of every peasant and mechanic with the Bible in his hand These are all plain facts too glaring  to be contradicted and theresore whatever we may think of the authority of these books the relations which they contain or the inspiration of their authors of these facts no man who has eyes to read or ears to hear can entertain a doubt because there are the books and in them there is this religion  Doubtless all this is well said It is pity it is not all quite so true But the truth is that these plain facts which our author says are too glaring to be contradicted are glaringly contradicted every dayIt is not only denied that the doctrines of the Christian faith  coincide  with and are  confirmed  by  reason  but it is denied by many that the  devotion actually introduced  by Christianity is  more rational  or the  morals purer  than those professed and practised by some people  who never heard of Christianity  If we believe  modern  history for which we have certainly as good authority as for the ancient there have been found  savage  nations if so we may call them whose simplicity and purity both of religion and morals have been remarkable  The plain  Peruvian  pure in heart  Strange to the guile and guilt of  art  Unaw'd by tenet text or tale  Erects his temple in the vale  Sacred to th' universal mind  The guardianGod of humankind  No firstlings here affront the skies  No clouds of smoaking incense rise  No hypocrite with doubtful face  No convert tortur'd into grace  No solid skull in wisdom's cowl  No hooded hawk nor solemn owl  Nor blind nor ominous invade  This spotless consecrated shade  But like the native of the spray  Man hails his Maker with the day  By nature taught Heav'n asks no more  In  spirit  and in  truth adore  EP TO LOR    We urge nothing against the purity of those morals now in practice throughout Christendom nor compare them with those of other nations now existing who have not embraced Christianity The comparison might be looked upon as too severe a libel on the good Christians of the age But might not an able casuist and as good a rhetorician as our author as plausibly declaim in favour of the conquerors legislators and moralists of unenlightened paganism to the shame of the immorality of professed Christians  Might he not exhibit a picture of horror faithfully drawn from the history of Christianity and the propagation of our holy religion still more shocking to humanity and contradictory to its divine precepts than is afforded  from that of the most horrid aera in the annals of heathenism  Hath the savage fury of hostile barbarians the avarice of insatiable tyrants or the boundless ambition of  heathen  conquerors been the cause of more bloodshed or greater cruelty than the zeal of religious fanatics the phrenzy of pious enthusiasm or the pride and avarice of  Christian  priests  Might not an artful declaimer we say very reasonably pretend that a religion whose professors have been guilty of so much wickedness could not possibly merit the epithets of  divine  or holy Would he not rather derive it from Hell as its most natural source than from Heaven the declared fountain of mercy and goodness  Declamations of this kind prove nothing  We shall proceed therefore to the consideration of the author's  third  proposition leaving that of his farther  proof  of the  second  till we come to his solving of objections where indeed much of it would have with more propriety found a place  SECT IV  On the third proposition  That from this book may likewise be collected a system of Ethicks in which every moral precept founded on reason is carried to a higher degree of perfection than in any other of the wisest philosophers of preceding ages every precept founded on false principles is totally omitted and many new precepts added peculiarly corresponding with the new object of this  religion  This proposition shewn to be very exceptionably illustrated affording at best rather a proof of the sublimity and purity of Christian morals and of the  advantages  rather than the  truth  of the Christian Religion  IN proof of this  third  proposition our author begins by making a distinction between the moral precepts of Christianity founded as he observes on reason and those precepts which being founded on false principles inculcate in fact no virtues at all Under the former he includes piety to God benevolence to man justice charity temperance and sobriety with all those which prohibit the contrary vices and all that debase our natures and by mutual injuries introduce universal disorder and consequently universal misery Under the latter he  classes those fictitious virtues which he says produce no salutary effects and however admired are no virtues at all such as  Valour Patriotism  and  Friendship  The  Monthly  Reviewers in their critique on our author's work observe on this distinction that they  never conceived that the virtues of  friendship fortitude  and  patriotism  do not form a part of the  moral system  of the  gospel  much less could they have urged the want of these virtues as a peculiar recommendation of its excellence They are conspicuously illustrated" say they "in the character of its author and it would be easy to produce striking instances in which his courage and friendship and concern for the welfare of his country were actually displayed But this is needless the  advocates of the Christian religion in answer to Lord Shaftesbury and others have sufficiently vindicated it in this respect  These  are unquestionably virtues of considerable importance and so far as they do not interfere with the general principles of benevolence which Christianity inculcates they constitute a part of  Christian  morality  It is well for these distinguishing critics that they bring in the  salvo  at the at the close of the above paragraph respecting these popular virtues  not interfering  with the general principles of benevolence which Christianity inculcates  This is the very point in question and however successfully the advocates for Christianity may have combated Shaftsbury and others there is some  room still left for opposing our author's argument  Valour  says he for instance or active courage is for the most part constitutional and therefore can have no more claim to moral merit than wit beauty health strength or any other endowment of the mind or body and so far is it from producing any salutary effects by introducing peace order or happiness into society that it is the usual perpetrator of all the violences which from retaliated injuries distract the world with bloodshed and devastation It is the engine by which the strong are enabled to plunder the weak the proud to trample upon the humble and the guilty to oppress the innocent it is the chief instrument which Ambition employs in her unjust pursuits of wealth  and power and is therefore so much extolled by her votaries it was indeed congenial with the religion of pagans whose gods were for the most part made out of deceased heroes exalted to heaven as a reward for the mischiefs which they had perpetrated upon earth and therefore with them this was the first of virtues and had even engrossed that denomination to itself but whatever merit it may have assumed among pagans with Christians it can pretend to none  There would be some argument in all this if because valour be the  occasional instrument  of oppression it be also the  necessary cause  of it or if men were always  mischievous  in proportion as they are  bold  But we presume that this is not the case  cruelty  being  characteristic  of cowardice and benevolence  of bravery Personal valour may therefore be justly esteemed to have some moral merit although as it is allowed to be in a great degree constitutional it is certainly no farther to be deemed a moral virtue than it is to be personally acquired For a virtue notwithstanding the plausibility of our author's reasoning we presume it may justly be stiled  Our author indeed says that few or none are the occasions in which Christians are permitted to exert their courage or valour "They are so far" says he  from being allowed to inflict evil that they are forbid even to resist it they are so far from being encouraged to revenge injuries that one of their first duties is to forgive them so far from being incited to destroy their enemies that they are commanded  to love them and to serve them to the utmost of their power  Surely our author here mistakes the nature of  that evil  which Christians are forbid to resist It certainly is not the moral evil of  injustice  Admitting they are not to  revenge  injuries surely they may exert their valour to  prevent  the execution of them If not a good Christian must not resist the violence of a robber a housebreaker or a murderer  But granting that individuals anxious to copy after Christian perfection are justified in thus  submitting  to though it be in fact  conniving  at the commission of acts of injustice valour may be yet a necessary virtue to the support and defence of Christian communities as we shail shew when we come to treat of  Patriotism  But though our author will not admit  active courage  to be a real virtue  passive courage  or fortitude he allows to be consistent with the purest Christian morality  Passive courage says he is frequently and properly inculcated by this meek and suffering religion under the titles of patience and resignation a real and substantial virtue this and a direct contrast to the former for passive courage arises from the noblest dispositions of the human mind from a contempt of misfortunes pain and death and a confidence in the protection of the Atmighty active from the meanest from passion vanity and selfdependence passive courage is derived from a zeal for truth and a perseveranee in duty active is the offspring of pride and revenge and the parent of cruelty and injustice in short  passive courage is the resolutiot of a philosopher active the ferocity of a savage Nor is this more incompatible with the precepts than with the object of this religion which is the attainment of the kingdom of heaven for valour is not that sort of violence by which that kingdom is to be taken nor are the turbulent spirits of heroes and conquerors admissibleinto those regions of peace subordination and tranquility  This is on the whole well said though we cannot agree that valour or active courage is always the offspring of pride and revenge or the parent of cruelty and injusticePassivecourage may also be justly stiled the  resolution  of a  philosopher  and yet active courage be very unjustly called the  ferocity  of a  savage  Not but that the activity of  some men is fierce and ferocious as the passiveness of others is tame and irresolute  On  Patriotism  our author declaims thus  Patriotism  that celebrated virtue so much practised in ancient and so much professed in modern times that virtue which so long preserved the liberties of Greece and exalted Rome to the empire of the world this celebrated virtue I say must also be excluded because it not only falls short of but directly counteracts the extensive benevolence of this religion A Christian is of no country he is a citizen of the world and his neighbours and countrymen are the inhabitants of the remotest regions whenever their distresses demand his friendly assistance Christianity commands  us to love all mankind Patriotism to oppress all other countries to advance the imaginary prosperity of our own Christianity enjoins to imitate the universal benevolence of our Creator who pours forth his blessings on every nation upon earth Patriotism to copy the mean partiality of an English parishofficer who thinks injustice and cruelty meritorious whenever they promote the interests of his own inconsiderable village This has ever been a favourite virtue with mankind because it conceals selfinterest under the mask of public spirit not only from others but even from them selves and gives a licence to inflict wrongs and injuries mot only with impunity but with applause but it is so diametrically opposite to the great characteristic of this institution  that it never could have been admitted into the list of Christian virtues  Without recurring to what other writers may have advanced in favour of the Christianity of patriotism we shall offer a few reasons that suggest themselves to us to shew that the love of one's self and one's country is not so inconsistent with that universal philanthropy inculcated by Christianity as this writer here supposes  True selflove and social fays the Poet are one and the same  Selflove But serves the virtuous mind to wake  As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake  Still from the central point the circle spreads  And wider grows as still the next succeeds  Thus father brother friend we  first  embrace  Our country  next next  all the human race  Rousseau somewhere observes that the universal philanthropy of those cosmopolites who have neither love for their relations friendship for their neighbours nor partiality for their country is justly to be suspected even as he who has no love for himself can hardly be supposed to love  all  mankind And yet Rousseau was a warm advocate for the purity of the Christian morality  What philosophy there is in this poetry will appear in the course of our argument  To the judicious omission of these false virtues  Valour Patriotism  and  Friendship  our author says  We may add that remarkable silence which the Christian legislator  every where  preserves on subjects esteemed by all others of the highest impotance civil government rational policy and the rights of war and peace of these he has  not taken the least notice  probably for this plain reason because it would have been  impossible to have formed any explicit regulations concerning them which must not have been inconsistent with the purity of his religion or with the practical observance of such imperfect creatures as men ruling over and contending with each other For instance had he  absolutely forbid all resistance to the reigning powers  he had constituted a plan of despotism and made men slaves had he  allowed it  he must have authorised disobedience and made them rebels had he in direct terms prohibited all war he must have left his followers for ever an easy prey to every infidel invader had he permitted it he must have licensed all that rapine and murder with which it is unavoidably attended  Now not to dwell on the impropriety in the last sentence of charging the  power permitting war with the licensing of all the rapine and murder attending it we object to the matter of fact as stated in the whole passage  Without insisting with the  Monthly  Reviewers that the character of our  Saviour  was  conspicuously illustrious  as a  patriot  we may safely deny that  he has not taken the least notice  of matters of patriotism and civil polity as our author asserts His reply to the Pharisees who tempted him on the subject of paying tribute  Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are of God  is an irrefragable instance of the distinction he made between religion and politics  Civil government national policy and the rights of war and peace were subjects indeed that appear not to have come directly under his decision  Had they so done we have no reason to think our Saviour lay under any kind of  impossibility  to give a very explicit and satisfactory answer  If he was not explicit however in  precept  respecting the authority of civil government it must be admitted he was illustriously so in  example  by his submission to the forms of justiciary trial and juridical condemnation which surely were not  necessary  to his death if no such example was intended to be given or precept thence to be inculcated  But had our Saviour himself given neither precept nor example on this head his inspired Apostles Peter and Paul have more than sufficiently done it by enjoining their disciples to the most unreserved obedience to the municipal laws and civil magistracy  of their times and thence instructing Christians in general to a similar obedience to the reigning powers that be in all times  In this however they have made men no farther slaves in this world than they are  Christians  whose faith is fixed and whose hopes are centered in another So far as they are still  men  and bound to take part in the concerns of this world while on their journey to the next they are at liberty to resist oppression and combat injustice whether that of a domestic tyrant or a foreign invader  "Had my kingdom" says our Saviour to Pilate  been of this world then would my servants have  fought  that I should not be delivered to the Jews  Granting that Christians therefore are not to propagate their  religion  by  force of arms or to  fight  for  Christ's kingdom  which is not of this world they are not forbidden to fight for their own share in the kingdoms which are of this worldIf men may not fight for their  religion  they may fight for their  liberty  and  property  and in our opinion they act the part of brave men and good Christians in so doing  And yet our author says  If Christian nations were nations of Christians all war would be impossible and unknown among them and valour could be neither of use or estimation and therefore could never have a place in the catalogue of Christian virtues being irreconcileable with all its precepts  Of a piece with this reasoning of our author's is that of  Rousseau  in his Social compact where he insinuates that  a  Christian soldier  is a kind of a contradiction in terms But we have here given our reasons for thinking otherwise from which it follows that even active valour appears to be a real and not a fictitious virtue  For if a good Christian be a good patriot he must be ready to  act  as well as  suffer  for his country He must at least be ready to fight if necessary in its  defence  and valour is as requisite to repel an invader as it is to invade the foe There is as much active courage required in  defence  as in  offence  and hence as loyalty and patriotism are the virtues of a good subject  valour  must have some merit even with Christians as a moral virtue at least active courage must be as much a moral virtue as  passive  They are insfact equally constitutional as above hinted and it is presumed are not badly illustrated by the following poetical allusion  The  Fountain  is thy favorite theme  That trickles forth a shallow stream  In murmurs soft a purling rill  What wilt thou do to work thy mill  How wilt thou make to ride at large  Thy timber or thy loaded barge  As much as purling rills admired  The navigable stream's required  The stream whose turbulence abides  The roaring of the swelling tides  Alike whose raging bosom swells  And back the threatening tide repels  Hence to the Valiant and the Brave  Giv'n half the world the rest to save  EP TO LOR    But be that as it may our author certainly falls into an error in supposing it necessary for a good Christian to renounce his country to become a citizen of the world a mere cosmopolite  In regard to the virtue of  Friendship  our author either wilfully or negligently imposes a change of terms upon us reasoning very inaccurately on the subject  "Friendship" says he  likewise although more congenial to the principles of Christianity arising from more tender and amiable dispositions could never gain admittance amongst her benevolent precepts for the same reason because it is too narrow and confined and appropriates that benevolence to a  single object  which is here commanded to be extended over  all  Where friendships arise from similarity of sentiments and disinterested affections they are advantageous agreeable and innocent but have little pretensions to merit  for it is justly observed  if ye love them which love you  what thanks have ye for sinners love those that love them But if they are formed from alliances in parties factions and interests or from a participation of vices the usual parents of what are called friendships among mankind they are then both mischievous and criminal and consequently forbidden but in their  utmost purity  deserve no recommendation from this religion  In reply however to what is here advanced on  friendship  and the text quoted from Luke in support of it may be opposed the precept inculcated in John xiii quoted also by our author in favour of that Christian virtue Charity  A new commandment I give unto you That ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all  men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another  Here we see that brotherlylove or mutual friendship which in the former text is represented as of little merit being the virtue of sinners is made the test or criterion of christianity the virtue one should imaging characteristic of saints  Christian charity in its  utmost extent  is certainly something more than mere friendship but we cannot help thinking that reciprocal affection or as our author stiles it that "benevolent disposition" which is here made the characteristic of Christ's disciples the test of their obedience and the mark by which they are to be distinguished is too near akin to friendship to admit of friendship's being with propriety discarded as a fictitious virtue or as no virtue at all  Our author indeed is far from reasoning accurately on this head For after depreciating as above the virtue specified he tells us he  means not by this to pass any censure on the principles of valour patriotism and honour  The attentive reader will here observe that in this respecification of the spurious or false virtues our author hath substituted the term  honour  instead of  friendship  The reason is that having changed his ground he found  that  more pertinent to the state of his argument Of that phantom modern  honour  indeed to which the most solid and substantial  friendships  are sometimes sacrificed he may say justly that  a man who makes this his ruling principle however virtuous he may be cannot be a Christian because  he erects a standard of duty and deliberally adheres to it diametrically opposite to the whole tenor of that religion  That the laws of such  honour  are incompatible with the rules of Christianity we readily allow though we cannot allow that the sirmest friendship for an individual is incompatible with that universal philanthropy which Christianity inculcates for all mankind Nay we do not hold  patriotism  or even  valour  to be such mere  heathenish  virtues as our author would represent them  "They may be useful" sayshe  and perhaps necessary in the commerce and business of the  present turbulent and imperfect state  and those who are actuated by them may be virtuous honest and even  religious  men all that I assert is that they cannot be  christians  And yet in a subsequent  page of the work we are expressly told that in the  present state  as enlightened by the gospel  if we will not accept of christianity we can have  no religion  at all    Surely this is inconsistent  Ay  and  No  too can never be good divinity  After degrading the false virtues of paganism he proceeds to enhance the  true  virtues of christianity These are poverty of spiritChristian charityPenitenceFaithSelfabasement and detachment from the world  Admitting all that is said in favour of most of these as being founded on scriptural authority the virtue of  faith  that which is the most immediately connected with the evidence of the divine origin of christianity demands our more particular attention  "Faith" says our author  is another moral duty injoined by this  institution of a species so new that the philosophers of antiquity had no words expressive of this idea nor nor any such idea to be expressed for the word  or  fides  which we translate  faith  was never used by any pagan writer in a sense the least similar to that to which it is applied in the New Testament where in general it signifies an humble teachable and candid disposition a trust in God and confidence in his promises when applied particularly to Christianity it means no more than a belief of this single proposition that Christ was the son of God that is in the language of those writings the Messiah who was foretold by the prophets and expected by the Jews who was sent by God into the world to preach righteousness judgment and everlasting life and  to die as an atonement for the sins of mankind This was all that Christ required to be believed by those who were willing to become his disciples he who does not believe this is not a Christian and he who does believes the whole that is essential to his profession and all that is properly comprehended under the name of faith  We see here that though our author scrupled at first setting out to say what pure Christianity was he has reduced it in this illustration of Faith to what he calls a  single  proposition But he cannot be ignorant that this single proposition is sufficiently multifarious and complicated  He cannot be ignorant that the expression  Son of God  is differently understood by different interpreters that some think it consistent with his being  a mere man while others think it exalts him to an equality with the Deity  He cannot be ignorant that his atonement by death for the sins of mankind is controverted and even boldly denied by a considerable number of professed Christians  To what purpose is it that our author tells us this proposition is the essential creed of a Christian if other writers of equal authority tell us otherwise Nay to what purpose is it we are told that the same proposition is to be found in the Scriptures whose truth we admit if they are liable to various interpretation  It is in vain to say that "when we are once convinced the Scriptures are of divine original we have nothing more to do but implicitly believe what they tell us" How many thousand volumes of controversy have  there not been written to determine what they do tell us And is it not still left as indeterminate as ever  Granting that implicit faith in divine revelation be our duty by what means are we to trace from the  history  of that revelation what is really revealed Surely it must be by the same means as those by which we become convinced of its divine original And if reason be competent in the one case it surely must be so in the other  At the same time if the operation of  grace  be necessary to impress the true sense and meaning of the scriptures on the mind and heart of the unconverted sinner why should it be less necessary as it is evidently equally expedient to convince him of the divine origin of revelation in general We firmly believe that admitting the reality of our author's conversion to  Christianity of which we have no reason to doubt he is much more indebted for it to the efficacious and irresistible impulse of divine grace than to all the pains he has taken and the ingenuity he has exerted in investigating the moral proofs of its divine institution  But we shall in this section confine ourselves in conformity to the author's method to the consideration of Faith merely as a Christian duty The objects of that Faith with the nature of it we shall discuss more particularly hereafter  "Faith" says he  cannot be altogether void of moral merit as some would represent it because it is in a degree voluntary for daily experience shews us that men not only pretend to but actually do believe and disbelieve almost any  propositions which best suits their interests or inclinations and unfeignedly change their sincere opinions with their situations and circumstances For we have power over the mind's eye as well as over the body's to shut it against the strongest rays of truth and religion whenever they become painful to us and to open it again to the faint glimmerings of scepticism and infidelity  when we  love darkness rather than light because our deeds are evil  And this I think sufficiently  refutes all objections to the moral nature of faith drawn from the supposition or its being quite involuntary and necessarily dependent on the degree of evidence which is offered to our understandings  We cannot pretend to call in question the ductility of our author's  believing  organs  or the power he has over them to enable him to believe what he pleases But we must own with regard to ourselves we should be happy to be possessed of such power of credulity so as to be able to believe every thing to be true which best suits our interests inclinations and circumstances even though we should thence be subject to be sometimes disagreeably undeceived We should get rid of many irksome reflections and enjoy many a happy hour at the hazard only of being disturbed from our pleasing reveries and exclaiming with the interrupted visionary  Pol me occidistis amici Non servastis  ait  cui sic extorta voluptas Et demtus per vim mentis gratissimus error  As it is we do not perceive ourselves especially just at present a whit more disposed to believe than to doubt  the reality of what we wish to be true We do not think the observation holds good at least so generally or in the degree here supposed The bold and sanguine indeed are apt to anticipate their wishes but the timid and saturnine are as apt to procrastinate even their just expectations It is as natural for the one to be confident as for the other to be dubious nay persons of the same constitution are not always in the same disposition or mood either of doubt or credulity  That there is some truth however in the rule with respect to its general application is probable as faith or facility of Belief is frequently and strongly recommended in the gospel  But by the faith or easiness of belief inculcated in the gospel can surely be meant nothing more than the  pious assent  and submissive acquiescence of  human reason to its mysterious and incomprehensible doctrines agreeable to its gospel signification mentioned above  Meaning an humble tractable and candid disposition a trust in God and confidence in his promises See page  and not that  rational conviction  which arises from a clear comprehension of a proposition and the evident demonstration of its truth The futility of recommending the latter kind of faith or facility of rational conviction we think is obvious  Indeed we do not see the necessity of demonstration to produce such an assent as is here admitted to constitute a  Christian's  Faith If such Faith be as our author says an act of the  will  as much as of the understanding there are many inducements to such an act that fall far short of demonstration  If it be as he observes "well worth every man's while to believe Christianity if he can" and such belief depends so much on his will one would think motives of selfinterest alone would excite him to shew that he could in this case do as he would  Is it not a sufficient incitement to faith in Christianity to ressect that "it is the surest preservative against vicious habits and their attendant evils the best resource under distresses and disappointments ill health and ill fortune and the firmest basis on which contemplation can rest"That "it is the only principle which can retain men in a steady and uniform course of virtue piety and devotion or can support them in the hour of distress of sickness and of death"  The  word  Faith indeed our author calls  unfortunate  It has says he  been so tortured and so misapplied to mean every absurdity which artifice could impose upon ignorance that it has lost all pretensions to the title of virtue but if brought back to the simplicity of its original signification it well deserves that name because it usually arises from the most amiable dispositions and is always a direct contrast to pride obstinacy and selfconceit If taken in the extensive sense of an assent to the evidence of things not seen it comprehends the existence of a God and a future state and is therefore not only itself a moral virtue but the source from whence all others must proceed for on the belief of these  all religion  and  morality  must  intirely  depend  Here again we must remind this writer of his having before admitted  that men might be  virtuous honest  and even  religious  men and yet  not  be  Christians  whereas now he makes not only  all religion  but  all morality  depend on Christian Faith for its very existence such faith being here expressly declared not only in itself a moral virtue but the source from whence all others must proceed  Wits  they say have short memories but when they turn logicians philosophers and divines they should endeavour to extend their memory and keep it on the stretch with the thread of their argument from one end to the other  On the whole with respect to Faith as a moral duty there appears to us but very little argument necessary to enforce it If men can believe or even halfbelieve what they will it is so much their interest to do it in believing  the truths of Christianity the man must be either a very great fool or a very great philosopher indeed who would remain one moment an Infidel  If as this writer declares  Faith  be also the source from whence all other real virtues must proceed who would not be a Christian in practice as well as theory without waiting a moment for any rational proof of the internal evidence of Christianity  SECT V  On the fourth or conclusive proposition  That such a system of religion and morality could not possibly have been the work of any man or set of men much less of those obscure and illiterate persons who actually did discover and publish it to the world and that  therefore it must undoubtedly have been effected by the interposition of divine power that is it must derive its origin from God  This proposition shewn to contain only corollaries of the preceding propositions and though true as to fact and therefore admitted  ex gratia  still problematical in argument  THIS proposition or rather two propositions united our author gives as corollaries to the three preceding presuming they are so conclusive as to amount to little short of demonstration It is indeed founded says he  on the very same reasoning by which the  material world  is proved to be the work of his invisible hand We view with admiration the heavens and the earth and all therein contained we contemplate with amazement  ment the minute bodies of animals too small for preception and the immense planetary orbs too vast for imagination we are certain that these cannot be the works of man and therefore we conclude with reason that they must be the productions of an omnipotent Creator  In the same manner we see here a scheme of religion and morality unlike and superior to all ideas of the human mind equally impossible to have been discovered by the knowledge as invented by the artifice of man and therefore by the very same mode of reasoning and with the same justice we conclude that it must derive its origin from the same omnipotent and omniscient Being  With due deference to this ingenious writer this like many other  parts of his work is rather declamatory than argumentative In contemplating the works of creation our wonder is excited and our admiration raised in proportion as human genius is enabled to trace the marks of divine wisdom in the Great Artificer  The vulgar indeed may gape and stare at what they cannot comprehend but how limited are their ideas how low are their conceptions of the power and wisdom of the Deity Their wonder at the most stupendous instances of both is like that of a child at the squeaking of a trumpet or the tinkling of a rattle  The admiration of the ignorant indeed is founded on their ignorance that of the scientific on their knowledge It is not from what we  do not  comprehend that we deduce the wisdom and power of the Creator but  from what we  do  comprehend which however comparatively little is the real foundation of our faith in his omniscience and omnipotence  On the other hand it is according to this writer from the incomprehensibility of the scriptures as well as of the works of nature that their divine origin is to be deduced  The manner of reasoning therefore is not as this writer asserts the same in both cases but totally different In reasoning from our view of the material world we prudently reason from what we know and how shall we reason otherwise "What can we reason but from what we know" And yet in logicising according to our author's mode from a view both of the material world and of revelation we foolishly attempt to reason from what we do  not  know  Thus he says of the former  It  is not in the least surprizing that we are not able to understand the spiritual dispensations of the Almighty when his material works are to us no less incomprehensible our reason can afford us no insight into those great properties of matter gravitation attraction elasticity and electricity nor even into the essence of matter itself Can reason teach us how the sun's luminous orb can fill a circle whose diameter contains many millions of miles with a constant inundation of successive rays during thousands of years without any perceivable diminution of that body from whence they are continually poured or any augmentation of those bodies on which they fall and by which they are constantly absorbed Can reason tell us how those rays darted with a velocity  city greater than that of a canon ball can strike the tenderest organs of the human frame without inflicting any degree of pain or by what means this percussion only can convey the forms of distant objects to an immaterial mind or how any union can be formed between material and immaterial essences or how the wounds of the body can give pain to the soul or the anxiety of the soul can emaciate and destroy the body That all these things are so we have visible and indisputable demonstration but how they can be so is to us as incomprehensible as the most abstruse mysteries of Revelation can possibly be  But so far are we from having any visible and indisputable demonstration of the union or even existence of two essentially different and distinct substances  in body and soul that our ablest philosophers deny the possibility of such demonstration  See Dr Priestley's Introduction to Hartley's Essays on Man  And indeed if our author did not himself confess it we should hardly be made to believe that he is himself so bad a philosopher as to take the evidence of  sense  than which nothing is niore fallible for demonstration  It is with propriety indeed he asks if reason can explain the popular system of the solar rays in exhibiting the emanation of light because that  popular  system is  unphilosophical  unreasonable and merely imaginary Were he acquainted with the real mechanism productive of those phenomena he might be struck with the amazing display of wisdom and power in the divine mechanism but he would find no greater mystery  tery in it than in the complicated operation of the most simple mechanic powers  We do readily agree with this ingenious investigator that we see but a small part of the great Whole that we know but little of the relation which the present life bears to preexistent and future states that we can conceive little of the nature of God and his attributes or mode of existence that we can comprehend little of the material and still lest of the moral plan on which the universe is constituted or on what principle it proceeds  But we cannot admit ourselves to be quite so ignorant of the mechanism of the material universe or the true principles of natural philosophy as our author appears to be  And though with regard to the theological  plan of the universe we should confess our greater ignorance and incapacity of comprehension we should  not  presume as our author in fact does to deduce the internal evidence of its divine origin from that very incapacity On the contrary we think even the best experience and historical information respecting both the works of  nature  and the doctrines of  revelation  equally insufficient to form such a conclusion  Whether from  Nature's  general law  The outlines of our creed we draw  Or think the truth be only given  In  revelation  pure from Heaven  It matters not unless we find  Some active index in the mind  Some ray of  grace  a purer light  To point or here or there aright  EP TO LOR  Another argument adduced by this author respects the propagation of this religion which he says is not less extraordinary than the religion itself or less above the reach of all human power than the discovery of it was above that of all human understanding  It is well known says he that in the course of a very few years it was spread over all the principal parts of Asia and of Europe and this by the minlstry only of an inconsiderable number of the most inconsiderable persons that at this time paganism was in the highest repute believed universally by the vulgar and patronized by the great that the wisest men of the wisest nations assisted at its sacrifices and consulted its oracles on the most important occasions Whether these were the tricks of the  priests  or of the  devil  is of no consequence  as they were both  equally u  +likely  to be converted or  overcome  the fact is certain that on the preach ing of a few fishermen their altars were deserted and their deities were dumb  Out of veneration for the subject we shall not place this argument in that ridiculous light into which it might be thrown At the same time having intimated in what a suspicious light we hold historical evidence in general we shall not enter into any dispute about matters of fact  The clergy are much obliged to the writer for putting their power on a par and of course making them what they ought to be a  match  for the  devil  We might otherwise controvert the  reputable  state of paganism at the commencement of the Christian aera the immediate dumbfounding of its oracles  by the preaching of the fishermen and the consequent establishment of Christianity in the principal parts of Europe and Asia  Atleast if its doctrine obtained a hearing and for a while a very partial reception they were soon obscured and obliterated while religion and philosophy were consigned to oblivion together  When Minerva could no longer protect her city it was forsaken by good fortune and would have lingered in decay but the barbarians interposed and suddenly completed its downfal Athens itself was pillaged by Goths and its libraries consumed Devastation reigned within and solitude without its walls  A situation in which according to Dr Chandler it remains to this day notwithstanding the successive efforts of Christian emperors and pontiffs by croisades and holy wars to effect its establishment  The belief of the vulgar in any age  reflects but little credit on their religion and as to the wisest men of the wisest nations of paganism consulting the oracle on important occasions we can no more infer their really interesting themselves in behalf of paganism than we can infer a similar conclusion in favour of Christianity from the similar farce which the wisest men of the wisest nations in Europe play now  Even in this protestant country do not our patricians senators and magistrates goin procession to church and pay their formal devoirs on certain red letter days though they laugh at the institution and even execrate the occasion In polished popish countries their religious ceremonies are still as much more pompous and solemn as the occasion or design is still more held in contempt and derision even by the  very persons assisting in their celebration  That sensible and discerning traveller Mrs Miller remarked in particular the arch sneer of the Roman pontiff while he performed the ceremony of serving at table and washing the feet of the poor priests in the sarce of the holy week  The fact is paganism was just in the same  reputable  state in Greece and Rome at that time as Christianity is in Paris and Rome at this day so that if political circumstances did not interfere and Christianity had no better support than the patronage of the Great and the piety of the populace it might without a miracle be preached out of both cities by a methodist or a mountebank in much less time than paganism was formerly preached out of Rome and Athens by a few fishermen Our author allows that  neither  learning nor sagacity is now able precisely to ascertain circumstances equally interesting of still later times  we wonder therefore he should rest on this circumstance alone the divine authority of the fishermen's commission It is equally surprising that having so many arguments and all of them according to him separately irrefragable he should think it necessary to accumulate others merely plausible  Of this kind is that paradoxical insinuation that the improbabilities on the other side of the question are so much greater that an infidel must be an unbeliever from mere credulity  See View page  Of the same kind is that trite insinuating  beggarly  plea as Lord Shaftsbury calls it of  what harm could  ensue if Christianity should after all prove a fable  There may be in some cases great virtue in that  if  but to  us  it appears very extraordinary that ever such a supposition should come from a writer who has laboured so hard and adduced so many arguments to prove its impossibilitySuppose quotha  Surely after all he does not think there is still  left a loop to hang a doubt on  that he is so very anxious to  persuade  those he may not  convince  that he dwells so earnestly on the  saving  pleas of their being nothing to be  lost  and so much to be  got  by believing in Christianity  See View page III  Be this as it may the whole argumentative part of the author's propositions and inference may be reduced to this  The Christian  system would never have entered into the heads of any persons whatever It is inconceivable therefore how such men as  did  could propagate it  Ergo  It must have been conceived and propagated by the immediate and miraculous interposition of the Deity    Such is in sum and substance the whole of this mighty argument in the exposition of which we have possibly bestowed already much more time and pains than the discerning reader will think necessary  But having proceeded so far with our author's  view  we shall now proceed till we have shewn the vanishing point of his  perspective    SECT VI  On the writer's general conclusions and his notions concerning the essential objects of the Christian faithTill these objects are precisely determined the determination of the question respecting their divine origin of little importance  ADMITTING even this writer's propositions to have been demonstrated and the internal evidence of the divine origin of the Christian religion fully proved we yet still recur to the question  What  is  the Christian religion or what are its doctrines  We have already observed that even the actual professors of Christianity are by no means agreed on this head  See page  Our author himself indeed complains  plains that  some there are who by perverting the established signification of words which they call explaining have ventured to expunge  all  the  principal  doctrines out of the scriptures for no other reason than that they are not able to comprehend them and argue thus  The scriptures are the word of God in his word no propositions contradictory to reason can have a place these propositions are contradictory to reason and therefore they are not there  But if these bold assertors would claim any regard they should reverse their argument and sayThese doctrines make a part and a material part of the scriptures they are contradictory to reason no propositions contradictory to reason can be a part of the word of God and therefore neither the scriptures nor the pretended revelation contained in them can be derived from him  this would be an argument worthy of rational and candid deists and demand a respectful attention but when men pretend to disprove facts by reasoning they have no right to expect an answer  Our author will therefore hardly think it worth his while to answer the questions put to him on this head by certain Reviewers who demand to know where or by what passages the New Testament inculcates the doctrines he specifies doctrines which the  rational  advocates of Christianity they pretend are afraid to adopt  These advocates  say they  cannot adopt notions and sentiments which are founded on ambiguous sigurative or sacrificial expressions and suspect a misinterpretation of scripture where the doctrine they embrace is  far removed from every tract of the human imagination  This is exactly what our author upbraids them for their wanting to reduce the extent of divine wisdom to the line of the human understanding  At the same time before we can admit our author to have deduced any conclusive argument respecting the internal evidence of the Christian religion it is requisite he should certify what its doctrines are The critics lastmentioned suspect a misinterpretation of scripture where the doctrine they inculcate is far removed from every tract of the human imaginationThe  Monthly  Reviewers say also  it has not occurred to  them  that doctrines allowed to be contradictory to reason are not on this account the less credible  On the other hand our author  makes their inconsistency with reason and their being above the flight of human imagination the very criterion of their divine origin and of course their credibility The scriptures according to him  contain ideas totally unheard of and quite dissimilar from any which had ever been thought on previous to their publication No other says he ever drew so just a portrait of the worthlessness of this world and all its pursuits nor exhibited such distinct lively and exquisite pictures of the joys of another of the resurrection of the dead the last judgment and the triumphs of the righteous in that tremendous day when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality No other has ever represented the supreme Being in the character of  three persons united in one God No other has attempted to reconcile those seeming contradictory but both true propositions the contingency of future events and the foreknowledge of God or the free will of the creature with the  overruling grace  of the Creator No other has so fully declared the necessity of wickedness and punishment yet so effectually instructed individuals to resist the one and to escape the other no other has ever pretended to give any account of the depravity of man or to point out any remedy for it no other has ventured to declare the unpardonable nature of sin without the influence of a mediatorial interposition and a vicarious atonement from the sufferings of a superior Being  Such are the objects of the Christian Religion according to this author but it is well known that the most essential of these doctrines are either totally disbelieved or explained away by a very considerable part of the professors of Christianity  The very Reviewers above mentioned in particular cannot allow with this writer  that the province of reason is  only  to examine into the  authority  of Revelation and when that is proved that reason has nothing more to do than to acquiesce  And so far  we  agree with  them  that  Reason  is just as well qualified to judge of the interpretation of particular texts and passages of scripture as to judge of the authenticity of the whole  But we deny on the authority of that very scripture that unenlightened  reason is qualified to judge of either Our author "readily as unnecessarily acknowledges as before observed that the scriptures are not revelations from God but the history of such Revelations" of whose imperfections and fallibility therefore we say nothing less than the influence of that divine grace which inspired the revelation itself can qualify any man to judge  Hence the moral arguments and historical evidence which our author adduces to prove the divine origin of revelation appear nugatory  To deny the probable facts he says related in the New Testament would be as absurd as to deny the probable facts in any other historyThis is true and yet the joint evidence of all the probable facts related in any history sacred or profane amounts to no more  than that moral evidence which will justify the belief of probable not improbable facts  The same may be said of the doctrines of the Scriptures if their divine authority is to depend on mere  historical  evidence they should appear to be as  rational  as the evidence on which that authority is supported is  probable  and not the credibility of both facts and doctrines left preposterously to be supported according to our author's scheme by the improbability of the one and incomprehensibility of the other  See page II Indeed the suggestion that any thing should be credible in proportion to its being incomprehensible is in itself a proof how far the human genius can soar into the mysterious and sublime Why therefore suppose it so incapable of inventing mysterious and sublime religious systems  Genius Lorenzo yours or mine  Faint image of a power divine  Endow'd with ev'n  creative  power  To form the Beings of an hour  To people worlds to light the skies  To bid a new creation rise  O'er all to wield the thunderer's rod  And act the momentary God  Ep To Lor    To ascertain the true system and genuine doctrines of this religion after the undecided controversies of above seventeen centuries and to remove all the rubbish which artifice and ignorance have been heaping upon it during all that time would indeed be an arduous talk which our author will by no means undertake  nor is it indeed necessary when he can reduce all the essentials as he supposes into so small a compass  But it is necessary that these essentials should be agreed on and rendered indisputable before the proof of their divine origin can be of any use  With respect for instance to one of the most essential  That Christ suffered and died as an atonement for the sins of mankind is a doctrine  says the writer  so constantly and so strongly enforced through every part of the New Testament that whoever will seriously peruse those writings and deny that it is there may with as much reason and truth after reading the works of Thucydides and Livy assert that in them no mention is made of any facts relative to the histories of Greece and Rome  We are perfectly of his opinion in this respect and yet it is with astonishing confidence the contrary is  maintained by many late writers of pretended candour and undoubted abilities So that while the doctrines of Christianity are thus in dispute that is till it be determined what the essential doctrines of Revelation are we conceive as we said before the determination of the question respecting its divine origin to be of very little importance even if it were determinable by our author's mode of argument But again we say we can by no means agree with him that men would believe divine revelation in proportion as its tenets were incomprehensible to the understanding  On the contrary the inference we should naturally draw from the imperfect state of human science and the insufficiency of unassisted reason to attain any portion of divine knowledge would be that nothing but the immediate influence of Grace the inspiration  of the Almighty which giveth understanding could induce the sceptic to believe either the divine origin of the scriptures or the doctrines they contain  SECT VII  On the objections that have been made to the divinity and veracity of the Christian religion and particularly to objection the  First  viz  That divine Revelation is incredible because unnecessary because the reason which God has bestowed on mankind is sufficiently able to discover all the religious and moral duties which he requires of them if they will but attend to her precepts and be guided by her friendly admonitions  This objection shewn to be neither properly stated nor satisfactorily removed  "IF" says our author  I have demonstrated the divine origin of the Christian religion by an argument which cannot be confuted no others however plausible or numerous founded on probabilities doubts and conjectures can ever disprove it because  if  it is once shewn to be true it cannot be false  See View page to    There is no parrying these  ifs  but  if  this writer's argument be  not  such as cannot be confuted there may besomething in the arguments founded on probabilities doubts and conjectures that make against itIt is on that supposition we imagine he attempts to refute such objections as it is on that conviction viz that his argument itself is invalid that we shall proceed to consider how far he has been successful in removing them  In answer to the first objection  See View page    That Revelation is incredible because unnecessary on the plea of the sufficiency of human reason to discover all the religious and moral duties God requires of them  He observes that  Reason alone is so far from being sufficient to offer to mankind a perfect religion that it has never yet been able to lead them to any degree of culture or civilisation whatever  deducing a demonstration as  it seems  to him from History that  although human reason is capable of  progression  in science yet the first foundation must be laid by supernatural instructions  See View p  Now says he  As Reason in her natural state is incapable of making  any  progress  Does our author make a distinction between  progress in knowledge  and  progression in Science  that human reason is admitted to be incapable of one and not of the other Or does he mean by  progression  in Science of which reason is incapable the starting  ab initio  which he confines to supernatural communication In either case there is an apparent contradiction  in knowledge so when furnished with materials by supernatural aid if left to the guidance of her own wild imaginations she falls into more numerous and more gross errors than her own native ignorance could ever have suggested  Only think reader of the  wild imaginations  of  Reason  And yet the  reasonable  suggestions which our author enumerates it must be owned are  wild  and extravagant enough  "SHE" says he that is  Reason    has persuaded some that there is  no God others that there can be no future state she has taught some that there is no difference between vice and virtue and that to cut a man's throat and to relieve his necessities are actions equally meritorious she has convinced many that they have no freewill in opposition to their own experience some that there can be no such thing as soul or spirit contrary to their own perceptions and others no such thing as matter or body in contradiction to their senses By analysing all things she can shew that there is  nothing  in  any thing  by perpetual shifting she can reduce all existence to the invisible dust of scepticism and by recurring to first principles prove to the satisfaction of her followers that there are no principles at all  After this curious piece of sophistical declamation he adds  How far such a guide is to be depended on in the important concerns of religion and morals I leave to the  judgment  of every  considerate  man to determine  That is after declaring  Reason  to be a fallacious guide and an incompetent judge he will leave it to the direction of that very guide and the determination of that very judge how far such direction and determination are to be depended onFor what else can he mean by leaving it to the  judgment  of any  considerate  man Is not this leaving it to Reason or setting up Reason in judgment on herself  To do justice to the noblest faculty of the human mind we will venture to declare that  Reason  never  suggested any of the above extravagancies to any man  Reason  never could persuade any man that "there is  no  God" Indeed the office of  Reason  is not  persuasion  but  conviction  and no man capable of conviction ever yet was even  persuaded  that  second  causes do not proceed from a  first  No  Atheist  e'er was known on earth  Till fiery zealots gave him birth  For controversy's sake their trade  Damning the heretic they made  Of the  first cause  or fools or wise  The pure existence none denies  Tho' in its  essence  few agree  For who  defines  INFINITY  EP TO LOR  Reason  never taught any man there is no difference between  virtue  and  vice  His necessary use of the very terms is a proof of it as well as the  natural sense of justice implanted in the breast of every humanbeing  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you  is not merely New Testament doctrine It is as old as the multiplication of mankind it is an universal principle a law of which to use the expression of a celebrated though inconsistent moralist  every man may find the exposition in his own breast  The Rambler No    Reason  never taught any man there  can  be no future state The utmost that reason ever taught is that we are indebted to  revelation  for the certain knowledge of such state or must depend chiefly on scriptural proof for the evidence of it Not but that there are even rational  arguments  in its favour as  well of the physical and moral  Setting aside the moral and religious pleas usually adduced in proof of a future state the strong probability of it is plausibly urged in the eighth epistle to Lorenzo on the simplest plea  To  animals  of every kind  Are their peculiar powers assign'd  To actuate strengthen or restrain  Nor sense nor instinct giv'n in vain  Man  a  mere animal  confess'd  Is yet distinguish'd from the rest  His pow'rs his views his labours  here  Presumptive of a  brighter sphere  Say why is  knowledge  giv'n to raise  Our wonder to our Maker's praise  Why are we taught our God t' adore  If seen in death his face no more  It cannot beOf heav'nly birth  Science  descending to the earth  To man hath Jacob's ladder given  Reaching an angel's flight to heaven  as of the religious kind  Is it because we know not why  So sad a thing for once to die  Is it so hazardous my friend  On God our maker to depend  That God to whom we being owe  Our friend and guardian here below  Who all along the vale of life  In ev'ry scene of care and strife  Affords his providential arm  To raise beneath or shield from harm  Is it for  him  so hard to save  That conscious Being from the grave  Secure Lorenzo in the power  That wak'd me at my natal hour  To me and mine in life so just  On him in death I mean to trust  Safe in the hollow of his hand  Fearless to fall by whom I stand  Of whom I kiss the chastening rod  And bless the  father  in the GOD  EP TO LOR  Reason  never persuaded any man that he hath no  freewill  in opposition to his own experienceIf she suggested a doubt of his capacity to  will or act without a motive it is a suggestion founded on all experience as his conviction of not being a mere mechanical machine actuated by no motives at all is founded on the same experience  Reason  never suggested the nonexistence of soul or body of matter or spirit in  contradiction  to our senses and perceptionsNeither matter nor spirit are ideas of  sensation  but of  reflection Reason  teaches us indeed the fallibility of sensation and perception and the means of correcting their errors and well for us it is that she does so we should else be totally destitute of science and for want of the instincts of other animals should be in a worse situation than the brutes that perish  From the above specification indeed of the supposed absurdities of human reason it appears to us that our author  hath neither physics nor metaphysics enough to enter on a philosophical discussion of the points in question We might therefore in like manner leave to the judgment of our considerate readers to determine whether the  Reason  or rather the  Imagination  of any man in his senses ever fell into grosser errors than has here that of our author in which case they would likewise determine how far such a guide is to be depended on in the important concerns of religion and morals  We might indeed censure here the superficial and illogical manner in which this writer has stated this objection  viz  his speaking of mankind as if the human mind was something distinct from and possessed of the power of controuling its essential faculties  But that excellent logician Mr Harris in his Dialogue on Happiness  hath illustrated in the most perspicuous manner the  reciprocal influence  of  reason  and  passion  in the conduct and composition of the human mind To such writers therefore we refer our author for the attainment of more precise ideas on this subject than he seems at present to possess or will ever obtain from the loose and rambling reasonings of those who stile themselves  Christian philosophers  or  rational divines  SECT VIII  On his reply to a second objection  That the Old and New Testament cannot be a revelation from God because in them are to be found errors and inconsistencies fabulous stories false facts and false philosophy which can never be derived from the Fountain of all Truth  This objection shewn to  be rather enforced by the author's concessions than removed by his conclusions  HERE our author very readily and as we before observed in our opinion for his argument unnecessarily acknowledges that the scriptures are not revelations from God but only the  history  of them  The revelation itself  says he  is derived from God but the history of it is the production of men and therefore the truth of it is not in the least affected by their fallibility  See View page  He admits of course that the inspired writers were not always under the influence of inspiration for if they had says he St Paul who was shipwrecked and left his cloak and parchments at Troas would not have put to sea before a storm nor have  forgot himself so much as to leave his cloak behind him  "But" continues he  if in these books a religion superior to all human imagination actually exists it is of no consequence to the proof of its divine origin by what means it was there introduced or with what human errors and imperfections it is blended A diamond though found in a bed of mud is still a diamond nor can the dirt which surrounds it depreciate its value or destroy its lustre  This allusion may be well calculated to catch the simple apprehension of the superficial reader but one of the least discrimination cannot fail to discover how totally inapplicable it is to the subject in question  A fine lady indeed may carelessly drop a manufactured brilliant into the  kennel to be accidentally picked up by a goldfinder but rough diamonds are not originally found there they have not their native bed in the streets or on the dunghill but are dug from mines prepared by Nature's process for their production in which state also they do not shine with a lustre so greatly superior to the surrounding materials  We by no means agree with our author therefore that his proof of the internal evidence of the divine origin of revelation does not suffer by admitting that  the prophecies are all fortunate guesses or artful applications and the miracles there recorded no better than legendary tales  See View page  On the contrary we conceive that such an heterogeneous mixture of truth and falsehood as he hypothetically  admits in the  history  as he calls it of revelation would if it really existed there very reasonably bring the truths it contains into doubtNay we will go so far as to admit that there really do appear so many errors and inconsistencies in that history that unenlightened reason cannot reconcile them the inspiration of  grace  being as necessary to point out these truths and induce a firm belief of them as it was to direct and enable the inspired writers to record them  SECT IX  On his reply to a third objection  That a wise and benevolent Creator should have constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another  Under the term religion in this objection the author  is shewn to include  morals  also but the purity of the Christian morals is shewn not to be calculated for the constitution of this world and therefore not required of Christians in their present state of probation  TO some speculative and refined observers it has appeared incredible  says our author  that a wise and benevolent Creator should have constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another that is that he should have revealed a religion to mankind which not only contradicts the principal passions and inclinations which he has implanted in their natures but is incompatible with the whole oeconomy of that world which he has created and in which he has thought proper to place them This say they with  regard to the Christian is apparently the case the love of power riches honour and fame are the great incitements to generous and magnanimous actions yet by this institution are all these depreciated and discouraged Government is essential to the nature of man and cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence corruption and imposition yet are all these strictly forbid Nations cannot subsist without wars nor war be carried on without rapine desolation and murder yet are these prohibited under the severest threats The nonresistance of evil must subject individuals to continual oppressions and leave nations a defenceless prey to their enemies yet is this recommended Perpetual patience under insults and injuries must every day provoke new insults  and new injuries yet is this injoined A neglect of all we eat and drink and wear must put an end to all commerce manufactures and industry yet is this required In short were these precepts universally obeyed the disposition of all human affairs mustbe entirely changed and the business of the world constituted as it now is could not go on  The  Monthly  Reviewers very justly observe on this passage that no serious advocate for Christianity can admit all these contradictions for indeed they militate not less against the practical principles of Christianity than against those of Commonsense Our author nevertheless boldly affirms that  Such is the Christian revelation tho' some of its advocates may perhaps be unwilling to own it and such it is constantly declared to be by him  who gave it as well as by those who published it under his immediate direction  To these he says  If ye were of the world the world would love his own  but  because ye are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you  John xv  To the Jews he declares  Ye are of this world I am not of this world  John viii  St Paul writes to the Romans  Be not conformed to this world  Rom xii  and to the Corinthians "  We speak not the wisdom of this world  Cor ii  " St James says  Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God  Jam iv  This irreconcileable  disagreement between Christianity and the world is announced in numberless  berless other places in the New Testament and indeed by the whole tenour of those writings These are plain declarations which in spite of all the evasions of those good managers who choose to take a little of this world in their way to heaven stand fixed and immoveable against all their arguments drawn from public benefit and pretended necessity and must ever forbid any reconciliation between the pursuits of this world and the Christian institution  We have as much contempt as our author can have for those good managers who choose to take as much of this world as they can with them in their journey to the next We are also as well satisfied as he can be that Christian morality in its purity is not calculated for the practice of man in  his present state but inculcated to inspire a proper disposition preparatory to another But for the same reasons we think the observance of it no farther required of us than it is  practicable  If it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men  Rom xii    says St Paul to the Romans The Christian religion enjoins not impossibilities it imposes not hard and impracticable duties requiring no more of any man than  lieth in him  The Scripture expressly declares  Its yoke is easy and its burthen is light  But are selfmortification penance the loving one's enemies the renouncing one's property and even one's life are these easy or lightWe believe that however they may have been required of particular persons on particular occasions the general imposition of such unnecessary commands have only served to disgust the welldisposed and sincere Christian and to fill the world with  hypocrites    The several texts therefore above adduced by our author are evidently misapplied  That a conformity to the vices and follies of the world is prohibited to Christians is most certain but where are they forbid to conform to the established customs and necessary duties of society Are they not on the other hand expressly enjoined to  submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake    To pay the most implicit obedience to magistrates and all that are in power for that the powers that be are of God  Where is it we ask again that Christians are required by the Scriptures so to act as to put an end to all commerce manufactures and industry to change the disposition of all human  affairs and put a stop to the business of the world  Are these extravagances deduced from our Saviour's sermon on the Mount and the instructions he gave his immediate disciplesMen possessed of the power of working miracles for their support or defence might safely indeed leave tomorrow to take care for itself careless of what they might eat drink or wear But setting aside the consideration that many things may be enjoined as particular and personal duties adapted to time and place which are by no means required universally setting aside also the consideration that our Saviour was exhibiting to his disciples a theory of morality adapted rather to man in a state of perfection than to man in his present imperfect state of probation it is plain that he had in view the holding  up a contrast to the boasted morality of those vainglorious hypocrites the Scribes and Pharisees in order to check that overweening pride with which they exulted in their goodworks over the sincere and humble penitence of the publican and sinner  Our Saviour did not preach the same strictness of morals to  all  as he did to his  immediate followers  Behold one came and said unto him  good master what good thing shall I do to inherit eternal life  And he said unto him Why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou wilt enter into life keep the CommandmentsHe saith unto him  which  Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness  Honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself    Every one of these commandments we see respects the discharge of the  social  duties incumbent on man in the present state of society Not one is mentioned of a nature purely religious even the first commandment respecting the very acknowledgment of God is omitted and yet Jesus says keep these commandments and thou wilt enter into life  The unattainable nature of moral  goodness  in this mortal state is also here strongly inculcated "There is none good but God  This passage has been urged in proof of our Saviour's giving up all pretensions to personal divinity But the contrary is plain on the slightest reflection This Querist who seems to have possessed all the spirit of the Pharisees came forsooth with his "good master" in opposition to those humble believers who saluted Jesus by the title of  Lord  to which they had no need to add the epithet of  good  Our Saviour who read the hearts of men and never wanted shrewdness of  reply questioned  him therefore why on the presumption he was addressing a  mere man  he called him  good  an epithet applicable only to  God  So far therefore is this passage from making against our Saviour's asserting his own divinity it proves that he did so in an instance where without any impeachment of his title he might have neglected it  "And yet  so good  was the presuming Querist that he answered he had kept all these commandments from his youth up pertly adding "what lack I yet" Jesus said unto him "if thou wilt be  perfect  go sell that thou hast give it to the poor and follow me"  This sacrifice of the things of this world we see was required of him not as the conditions of his salvation but as a proof of that moral perfection to which he pretended and as a qualification necessary for him to become an immediate follower and disciple of Jesus Christ  In like manner we will venture to say that Christianity at this day requires no purer morals in its professors than as much as in them lies to live peaceably with all men to keep those commandments which are essential to the good of society and the peace and happiness of mankind  Let the sincere Christian do this and we believe he will enter into eternal life even though he should be somewhat nice in regard to what he eats drinks and wears though he should promote commerce manufactures and  industry yea though he should consistently with the laws of his country resent insults punish injuries enter into the civil or even military service of government draw his sword against the enemies of the state and even fatally embrue it in blood to chastise the insolence of unnatural rebellion  SECT X  On his reply to a fourth objection  That if this revelation had really been from God his infinite power and goodness could never have suffered it to have been so soon perverted from its original purity to have continued in a state of corruption through the course of so many ages and at last to have proved so ineffectual to the reformation of mankind  The manner in  which this objection is attempted to be removed shewn to reflect the highest indignity on the divine Author of the Christian religion as well as on that religion itself  IN answer to this  fourth  objection our author very candidly and very simply replies that on examination all this will be found inevitableWe believe it things could not possibly be otherwise because such was the general design of Providence and such the Christian dispensation which was a part of it  In reply to this objection indeed our author admits the whole force of it which he endeavours to elude by a very simple expedient much such another as that by which he accounts elsewhere for the origin of evil Necessity hard necessity which even the omnipotence of the Deity could not  prevent What is this but making the God of the Christians a mere heathen Jupiter subject to the controul of superior Fate  He admits that after Christianity had had made its way by means of the preaching of the poor and mean in holes and caverns under the iron rod of persecution till it so far prevailed as to obtain the countenance and protection of princes when kings became its patrons and queens its nursing mothers he admits we say that it could no longer withstand the irresistible effects of the natural imperfection of man and the political evils of civil society  At length the meek and humble professors of the gospel inslaved these princes and conquered these conquerors their patrons and erected for themselves such a stupendous fabric of wealth and power as the world  had never seen they then propagated their religion by the same methods by which it had been persecuted nations were converted by fire and sword and the vanquished were baptised with daggers at their throats  See View page  Horrid abominations exclaims our author at the enormities of the poor pagans But what more horrid abominations could they be guilty of than these Were any of those which our author says were practised in the pagan world and vanished at the approach of Christianity more horrid or more abominable And yet they were  permitted  it seems because they could not be  prevented  They proceeded we are told from a chain of causes and consequences which could not have been broken without changing the established course of things by a constant series of  miracles or a total alteration of human nature  See View page  What a pity that a business which had so promising a beginning should be so soon interrupted by such sinister and unforeseen accidents For surely they must have been unforeseen when the course of things was about to be established and human nature first constituted  To be serious this is a bungling excuse for a supposed blunder in the first outset of things unless we seriously adopt the reason our author deduces from revelation  viz  that it could not be otherwise  because that all men should be exempted from sin and punishment is utterly repugnant to the universal system and that constitution of things which infinite wisdom has thought proper to  adopt  View page  This may be but we revere the eternal councils of the great author and disposer of all things too much to suppose he was ever under the predicament of  adopting  any measure or system of action that resulted originally from any thing but his own will  SECT XI  On his reply to the fifth objection  The incredibility of some of its doctrines particularly those concerning the Trinity and atonement for sin by the sufferings and death of Christ the one contradicting all the principles of human reason and the other all our ideas of natural justice  This objection shewn to be rather evaded than solved the author not having fairly and fully stated the difficulties it really contains  TO these objections says our author  I shall only say that no arguments founded on principles which we cannot comprehend can possibly disprove a proposition already proved on principles which we do understand and therefore that on this subject they ought not to be attended to  But this is rather evading the difficulty than solving it Indeed with regard to the doctrines of the Trinity and vicarious atonement he bestows on them some little attention In respect to the former he observes  That three beings should be one being is a proposition which certainly contradicts reason that is  our  reason but it does not thence follow that it cannot be true for there are many propositions which contradict our reason and yet are demonstrably true  That this is a proposition contradictory to reason we admit but we deny that it is either true or capable of demonstration There may be propositions contradictory to reason and yet not demonstrably false nay they may be such as however contradictory to reason we cannot help believing to be true but to be demonstrably so they must be perfectly and evidently consonant to reason for demonstration is nothing but the result of a compleat process of rational argument  That propositions  apparently  false are  demon strably  true is almost too notorious to merit illustration Instances occur every moment in which the inference of our illinformed and  immediate apprehension  is directly contradictory to that of a betterinformed and  deliberate reflection  There are propositions also that require not only much deliberation but much instruction before our reason is qualified to pass any judgment concerning them This our author elsewhere admits  See Section XII  though under the present head he proceeds to support his assertion by example offering an instance of the propositions which he says are  contradictory  to  reason  and yet  demonstrably true  One says he is the very first principle of all religion the being of a God for that any  thing  should exist without a  cause  or that any  thing  should be the  cause  of its own  existence  are propositions equally contradictory to our reason yet one of them must be true or  nothing  could ever have  existed  The  Monthly  Reviewers very justly insinuate that here is a confusion of  terms indeed our author here sadly exposes his want of logical precision Not to cavil at his calling  God  a  thing  his opposing the term  being  or  existence  instead of  effect  to the term cause is illogical in the highest degree  All  created beings  or  things  are confessedly the EFFECTS of  one first  CAUSE but we conceive this is the first time so expert a logician ever made such a blunder as to put the  first  cause on a footing with  second  causes and assert as our author in fact does that no  cause  could ever have existed that was not the  effect  of some  prior  cause If he is not betrayed here into a slat denial of the existence of a God or  first cause  we know not what is such  Our author palpably mistakes the permanent predicament of  existence  and  duration  for the transitory one of  production  and  succession  In the  former  the  terms  being  and  thing  are used with propriety in the latter those of  cause  and  effect  with equal propriety but it is a solecism in ratiocination to confound one with the other For though in the order of nature  the existence  of one  thing  becomes the productive  cause  of  another  the God of Nature the primary and efficient cause of all superier to the work of his hands  Some writers indeed and those of celebrity have imagined a  scale  of beings rising up from the meanest of God's creatures to the Creator himself but we always regarded this as groundless and visionary  Thy pride Lorenzo disbelieve  Let Locke nor Addison deceive  For tho creation's varied plan  Assigns  degrees  respecting  man  Yet humbly know and learn to fear  GOD is beyond this mortal sphere  Created beings tho his care  Doth he with them cteation  share  Oh no the system all his own  God the creator stands alone  At equal distance all his plan  The mite the seraph and the man  EP TO LOR  is exempted  from the laws of subordination which he has prescribed as the tegular succession of second causes and effects It is indeed in our conception a kind of metaphysical blasphemy to represent  God  as an  effect  which could not have existed without a  cause  even though it be sheltered uhder the metaphysical absurdity of supposing that effect the cause of itself  And yet our author proceeds with his examples  In like manner the overruling grace of the Creator and  the freewill of his creatures his certain foreknowledge of future events and the uncertain contingency of those events are to our apprehensions absolute contradictions to each other and yet the truth of every one of these is demonstrable from Scripture reason and experience  Here again our author confounds the  absolute  and  eternal  attributes of the  Creator  with the  relative  and  temporary  properties of his  creatures  That these should be  apparently  contradictory is no wonder but that they are not as our author affirms  absolute  contradictions is known to every man of sense and scicnce that hath bestowed sufficient attention on the subject to whom these seeming contradictions must be easily reconcileable The overruling grace of the Creator is irresistible and positive the freewill of  his creatures resistible and comparative The agency of man compared with that of the Deity is limited confined and servile On the other hand if compared with the agency of inferior animals plants c it is liberal and freeThe foreknowledge of the Deity is absolute and indisputable as the succession of future events is with respect to him fixed and unalterable with respect to man indeed their contingency is as uncertain as is his want of foreknowledge or ignorance of their necessary succession  All  Nature  is but  Art  unknown to thee  All  chance direction  which thou canst not see  But to recur to the author's remarks on the doctrine of the Trinity It is with propriety he observes that  the difficulties with respect to our belief in this doctrine arise from our imagining that the mode of existence  of all beings must be similar to our own that is that they must all exist in space and time Hence says he very justly proceeds our embarrassment on this subject We know that no two beings with whose mode of existence we are acquainted can exist in the same point of time in the same point of space and that therefore they cannot be one but how far beings whose mode of existence bears no relation to time and space may be united we cannot comprehend and therefore the possibility of such an union we cannot positively deny  This is philosophical and just but there is a wide difference between positively denying a doctrine and absolutely believing itMost certain however it is that the doctrine of the Trinity as it is taught by some of the  Athanasians cannot possibly be believed by any human being  By nonsense nor deceit misled  The honest heart and sober head  Some meaning positive and plain  A creed believ'd must needs contain  A parrot else if none deceive her  A sound and orthodox believer  As much convine'd as e'er was yet  Your Athanasian paroquet  EP TO LOR  Our author reduces this formidable absurdity for such it is as some trinitarians represent it to a mere simple proposition as easy to be believed as that three equal angles or sides constitute one equilateral triangle But this is not the case In the exuberant and rattling eloquence of the famous Dr Jeremy Taylor the mystery of the Godhead is thus enigmatically displayed  See what was to be taught a  trinity in the unity of the Godhead  that is the Christian arithmetic  Three are one and one are three  So Lucian in his Philopatris or some other decides the Christian doctrines see  their  philosophy  Ex nihilo nihil fit  No  Ex nihilo omnia  all things are made of nothing and a  manGod  and a  Godman  the same person  finite  and  infinite  born  in time  and yet from  all eternity  the son of God but yet born of a woman and she a  maid  but yet a  mother  resurrection of the dead reunion of soul and body this was part of the Christian physics or their natural philosophy  See a Moral Demonstration of the Truth of the Christian Religion first printed in the year lately reprinted for Cadell Page  With due deference to the authority of this eminent divine as well as to  his late editor Bishop Hurd all this is merely declamatory It is also so far sophistical in that it is the Christian  theology  and not either  arithmetic  or  physics  The  mathematics  and  natural philosophy  of the  Christian  and the  Heathen  are the same nor is it any impeachment to the  divinity  of  revelation  that it has no place in the  cyclopaedia  or circle of human arts and sciences  The case is these writers do not make a proper distinction between a palpable contradiction in terms and an apparent contrariety in fact There is also a necessary distinction to be made between the belief of the truth of a proposition or the believing a proposition to be true and the belief of the proposition itself the former being consistent with an imperfect apprehension of its meaning and the other consistent only with a clear and precise  comprehension as well of the predicate as of the subject  From these distinctions arises a third equally just and necessary between the  faith  of the  Christian  and the  belief  of the  philosopher  But of these distinctions more fully hereafter  See the following Section  SECT XII  On his reply to the sixth objection  That however true these doctrines may be yet it must be inconsistent with the justice and goodness of the Creator to require from his creatures the belief of propositions which contradict or are above the reach of that reason which he has thought proper to bestow on them  This objection  answered by denying that genuine Christianity requires any such belief The nature of the Christian faith investigated and its latitude defined Christianity as it requires nothing  impracticable  to be  performed  so it requires nothing  impossible  to be  believed  TO this  sixth  objection our author answers "Genuine Christianity requires no such belief"  It has discovered to us many important truths with which we were before entirely unacquainted and amongst them are these that three Beings are some way united in the divine essence and that God will accept of the sufferings of Christ as an atonement for the sins of mankind These considered as declarations of facts only neither contradict or are above the reach of  human reason The first is a proposition as plain as that three equilaral lines compose one triangle  That  any three  lines might do properly disposed though  not equal  indeed this allusion is by no means adequate and but little pertinent  the other is as intelligible as that one man should discharge the debts of another In what manner this union is formed or why God accepts these vicarious punishments or to what purposes they may be subservient it informs us not because no information could enable us to comprehend these mysteries and therefore it does not require that we should know or believe any thing about them  How not  any thing about them  Surely this is loosely and badly expressed As a declaration of fact merely it has been already observed that the  orthodox doctrine of the Trinity is not so simple and rational as here laid down but much more complex and paradoxical  As to the  quomodo  of the triunion and the reason why God accepts of a vicarious atonement for the sins of mankind these are certainly beyond rational investigation but Christians are doubtless required to believe so much about them as that the facts are as possible as their declaration is true  Again if no information can enable us to comprehend these mysteries it is not with very great propriety such important  truths  are said to be  discovered  by Revelation The doctrines as mere declarations indeed may be said to be  discovered  as they were not  divulged  before but if those doctrines themselves still remain mysterious they  would with more propriety be said to be simply declared or promulgated than their  truth  to be  discovered  "The truth of these doctrines" our author owns  must rest intirely on the authority of those who taught them but then says he we should reflect that those were the same persons who taught us a system of religion more sublime and of ethics more perfect than any which our faculties were ever able to discover but which when discovered are exactly consonant to our reason and that therefore we should not hastily reject those informations which they have vouchsafed to give us of which our reason is not a competent judge  By the  truth of these doctrines  he evidently means the  credibility  of them but what he means by the  exact consonance  of those which are discovered  to our reason we do not understand It is from the want of such consonance necessarily arising from the mysterious nature of such doctrines that  we  deduce the incompetency of reason to judge of their truth  But men as our author justly observes may very reasonably believe propositions to be true of whose truth nevertheless they are no competent judges "If an able mathematician" says he  proves to us the truth of several propositions by demonstrations which we understand we hesitate not on his authority to assent to others the process of whose proofs we are not able to follow why therefore should we refuse that credit to Christ and his apostles which we think reasonable to give to one another  Why indeed It is very unreasonable  they  doubtless deserve our creditBut still we recur again to the  authenticity  of the  history  of the gospel and the  interpretation  of its doctrines Admitting therefore the propriety of placing the utmost confidence in the veracity of Christ and his apostles and that what they really meant to inculcate is worthy of all acceptation still we say the cautious and candid Christian may without the immediate direction of divine grace remain at a loss what to believe  As to what genuine Christianity  requires  us to believe here again we plead for the same necessary latitude in matters of  faith  as we have before done in  morals  We call it a  necessary  latitude because to whatever purity of faith or morals  hypocrisy  may pretend men always deceive themselves or others when they affect to have a command over their  reason  and  passions  which they can derive from no resource either of Nature or Grace the only springs of human reflection and action  Indeed our author  is in this respect and very justly a latitudinarian too for though he hath reduced the Christian's creed as before observed to a very small compass he hath by so doing opened a wide field for scepticism And yet so far are the dictates of genuine Christianity even in our opinion consonant with reason that as it requires nothing which is  impracticable  to be  performed  so it requires nothing which is  impossible  to be  believed  But how shall such a shortsighted Being as man know what is or is not impossible  True he may be conscious of what is  impracticable  as  that regards himself but he Cannot prescribe impossibilities to God of whose omnipotence he is no judge To infinite power every thing is possible except indeed inconsistency or selfcontradiction Every proposition therefore respecting the deity that doth not involve a contradiction in  terms  however improbable or  apparently  impossible may yet be really possible and therefore believed on proper evidence powerful persuasion or the influence of divine grace whereas no kind or degree of evidence no power of persuasion no influence human or divine can possibly make any man believe a  contradiction  in  terms  This is one of those  impracticabilities  which respects himself Of the  incompatibility  of  facts  he may not be a competent judge but of the  incongruity  of his own  deas  he cannot but be sensible To a direct contradictionin  terms  therefore he cannot give his unfeigned assent though to the most egregious falsehood or palpable contrarietyin  fact  he may  This distinction between a  contrariety  in  fact  and a  contradiction  in  terms  we conceive has not sufficiently been attended to The one is popular and physical consisting of natural inconsistency and moral improbabilities the other philosophical and logical consisting of artificial inconsistencies and verbal incongruities Hence however incompetent human reason may be to determine of possibilities in nature and probabilities in providence it is competent to judge of the agreement and disagreement of its own ideas Words therefore being the artificial signs of our ideas  a contradictioninterms  becomes obviously and  certainly discaverable whilst a  contrarietyinfacts  is not  The greatest falsehoods in fact hence frequently pass for incontestible and demonstrable truths on those who would immediately detect a direct contradiction in termsTo illustrate this distinction by a familiar elucidation A man as totally ignorant of the Copernican system as even the learned formerly were might be told that the sun is much bigger than the earth and does not move round it every twentyfour hours as it appears to do the earth only moving imperceptibly rounds its own axis and carrying round with it every thing adhering to its surface with great rapidity  An astronomer we say might tell an ignorant man this who might either believe it confiding in the astronomer's veracity although it seemed  contrary to the evidence of his senses or he might disbelieve and even deny it confiding more in that evidence he might say  I cannot be persuaded out of my senses I can see the size of the sun and see it goes round the earth which I also perceive stands all the while stockstill It is impossible that I and every body about me should be whisked round with such velocity without our perceiving it  If therefore he should believe the astronomer's assertion however true it be in reality he would believe what we call a contrarietyinfact viz that things really are as he perceives they are not The same illustration holds good respecting the existence of soul and body matter and spirit c of which it is popularly supposed we have positive proos or indubitable demonstration  whereas we have nothing more than the imperfect evidence of our sensations and perceptions which are so far from directly affording us demonstration of any thing that they are constantly and egregiously deceiving us in almost every thing  It will follow from the establishment of this distinction that however justifiable men of discernment may be in their disbelief or denial of  inconsistent  or  selfcontradictory propositions  the very limited extent of their knowledge in the works of nature and the ways of providence disqualifies them from taking upon them absolutely to deny improbable and even  apparently  impossible facts  Another distinction which here offers itself to our consideration is  that  between believing the truth of a doctrine or the believing that a doctrine  is true and the belief of that doctrine itself  For a man may very properly be said to believe the truth of a proposition in other words that such proposition is true although the doctrine or declaration it contains appears doubtful nay although the terms of such proposition be totally unintelligible in which latter case he certainly cannot with any propriety be said to believe the proposition or doctrine itself  The learned and ingenious author of a late plea for the divinity of Christ  Mr Robinson  lays down in form indeed the following proposition  The belief of a proposition does not necessarily imply a clear idea of the object of which the proposition affirms any thing  So that in this case a man may be said to  believe  a proposition he does not  understand  But to this we cannot subscribe a  clear  idea is certainly required as well of the  subject  as the  predicate  though not a  full  or  adequate  idea The idea entertained of God by a philosopher and that attached to the same term by an ignorant clown are widely different the one magnificent and extensive as human science can teach or imagination conceive the other mean and confined as ignorance and dulness can dictate We will yet venture to say they are both equally  clear  nay we conceive the confined idea of the clown may be the clearest as being more definite in coming nearer the precision of our ideas of material objects This very precision indeed is more destroyed by the effulgence of too much light than by the obscurity attending the want of it even as the face of the  moon is seen clearer than that of the sun  No doctrine or proposition therefore can in our opinion be actually believed unless it be clearly understood and yet propositions which are not clearly understood nay not understood at all may comprehend a truth or may be true and "that they do "so" is a proposition that may be believed  A man may believe as already observed a contrariety in fact a great falsehood supported by competent evidence or credible affirmation so may he with equal propriety and on the same grounds believe the truth of a mysterious or even unintelligible proposition or that such a proposition is true  But then this is not the proposition he believes this is quite a new one  viz  That the said mysterious or unintelligible proposition is true  which new proposition is neither mysterious nor unintelligible and therefore may be believed  It has been frivolously objected that  a mathematician who demonstrates the truth of any proposition does not  believe  it to be true he  knows  it to be so  True he does not  only believe  it to be true he does  more  he also  knows  it to be so he believes not only the truth of the proposition but the proposition itself Knowledge includes belief though belief does not include knowledge    Thus a magistrate or officer who administers affidavits  ex officio  and knows not the contents may on the credit and veracity of the deponent believe the truth of his deposition or that the contents of such deposition are true but he cannot with any propriety  priety be said to believe such affidavit itself or the contents of such deposition because he knows not what those contents are and therefore can believe nothing about them  These distinctions lead us naturally to a third which we flatter ourselves may tend to conciliate the minds of polemical disputants or at least to abate their rancour which too often prevails between the orthodox and heterodox in religious disputes and this is the distinction before hinted at between the  faith  of the Christian and the  belief  of the  Philosopher  The former does not require a rational conviction of the proposition believed whereas the belief of a philosopher not only requires rational conviction founded on positive evidence but it requires also a clear and precise comprehension of all the terms of the  proposition laid down On the contrary the unfeigned assent or voluntary submission of reason to the truth of a proposition whose terms are not even perfectly understood is sufficient to entitle a Christian to rank among the number of the faithful  Agreeable to our author's description of the nature of faith See page  But a philosopher who makes every thing submit to reason cannot believe either that which he does not clearly conceive or that of which he is not as clearly convinced  Should he as a man be induced by any means or motives to give up the authority of his reason in matters where human reason is incompetent he would do this not as a  Philosopher  but as a  Christian  and of eourse be entitled to all the privileges and immunities attached to that character  Of these our author has given an encouraging enumerationUnhappily for unbelievers they require a proof of the truth of even those advantages or what would answer the same end a belief or persuasion of their reality There can be no doubt but this would be sufficient to make them immediately adopt an expedient so admirably calculated to promote their ease and happiness But whence is such belief or persuasion to be derived From reason Surely not unless the truth of the Christian religion could be much more rationally proved than by what this writer calls demonstration  But what we ask again is demonstration And what is its influence Intuition is not demonstration instinct is not demonstration perception  is not demonstration nor is conceit demonstration and yet intuitive or instinctive impulse the force of imagination or firm persuasion may have equal influence on the mind with that of the clearest demonstration  This influence however is of another kind and though it be not rational it has often a greater effect over even rational creatures than the most clear and precise of rational deductions We experience  this  even in the common concerns of life in the more  uncommon  the force of inclination and the power of imagination are so notoriously known to overpower the strongest of our reasoning faculties that it were absurd to support the credit of demonstration in cases where even demonstration itself must give way to prejudice and prepossessionAnd if to prejudice and prepossession surely  to the operation of Grace and the influence of divine inspiration  That something more than the mere exercise of reason or even a goodwill or inclination to believe appears nenecessary from our author's own confession  "There are people" says he  who from particular motives have determined with themselves that a pretended revelation founded on so strange and improbable a story so contradictory to reason so adverse to the world and all its occupations so incredible in its doctrines and in its precepts so impracticable can be nothing more than the imposition of priestcraft upon ignorant and illiterate ages and artfully continued as an engine welladapted to awe and govern the superstitious vulgar To talk to such about the  Christian religion is to converse with the deaf concerning music or with the blind on the beauties of painting They want all ideas relative to the subject and therefore can never be made to comprehend it to enable them to do this their minds must be formed for these conceptions by contemplation retirement and abstraction from business and dissipation by illhealth disappointment and distresses and possibly by  divine interposition  or by enthusiasm which is usually mistaken for it Without some of these preparatory aids together with a competent degree of learning and application it is impossible that they can think or know understand or believe any thing about it If they profess to believe they deceive others if they fancy that they believe  they deceive themselves I am ready to acknowledge that these gentlemen as far as their information reaches are perfectly in the right and if they are endued with good understandings which have been entirely devoted to the business or amusements of the world they can pass no other judgment and must revolt from the history and doctrines of this religion 'The preaching Christ crucified was to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness'  Cor i  and so it must appear to all who like them judge from established prejudices false learning and superficial knowledge for those who are quite unable to follow the chain of its prophecy to see the beauty and justness of its moral precepts and to enter into the  wonders of its dispensations can form no other idea of this revelation but that of a confused rhapsody of fictions and absurdities  This is saying a great deal in discredit of a revelation whose divine origin is so obvious and whose doctrines are so reasonable as our author pretends Surely there are no men of  good under standings  so  entirely  devoted to the business or amusements of the world as to be  quite unable  to form any other idea of revelation than that it is a confused rhapsody of fictions and absurdities  Granting indeed it be so and that the pursuits of this world are so totally incompatible with the things of the next it surely affords a strong argument that reason is an incompetent judge in  every thing  relative to the system and that nothing but divine inspiration  can effectually inculcate the dictates of divine revelation  The admitting that  possibly divine interposition  may be necessary to prepare  some  persons for believing the truths of the Christian religion is in fact admitting that to be true in a degree and in particular cases which we contend for altogether and universally  We are sorry however to find such  divine interposition  put on a footing with  illhealth  disappointment distress and even enthusiasm  Not that we conceive the mode of that interposition to be confined to unaccountable impulse or miraculous conversion Natural means may in this case be made the forerunners of supernatural effects nay we will not deny that even enthusiasm or a  false  inspiration itself may be made the harbinger of the  true  Through even the  foolishness  of  preaching  were unbelievers formerly converted Learning and study also may be made the concomitant means of grace but we do not conceive they are essentially necessary to give efficacy to other means or to divine interposition itself If they were it would not appear that God had chosen the foolishness of this world to confound the wise It would rather be the subjecting of divine wisdom to human sagacity and the excluding from Christianity all but learned divines and profound philosophers  "And yet" says our author  if it be asked was Christianity intended only for these I answer No It was at first preached by the illiterate and received by the ignorant and to such are the practical which are the most necessary parts of it sufficiently  intelligible but the proofs of its authority undoubtedly are not because these must be chiefly drawn from other parts of a speculative nature opening to our inquiries inexhaustible discoveries concerning the nature attributes and dispensations of God which cannot be understood without some learning and much attention From these the generality of mankind must necessarily be excluded and must therefore trust to others for the grounds of their belief if they believe at all  "And hence" continues he  perhaps it is that faith or easiness of belief is so frequently and so strongly recommended in the gospel because  if men require  proofs of which they themselves are incapable and those who have no knowledge on this important subject will not  place some confidence in those who have the illiterate and unattentive must ever continue in a state of unbelief  Our author here seems to have run away from his argument the faith recommended in the gospel and therefore  required  of Christians by  God  may be widely different from that  required  by  men  either of themselves or of others and of course the  requisite proofs  of the doctrines believed may be different also  We cannot admit therefore this necessity of any man's pinning his faith on his neighbour's sleeve The most ignorant and illiterate man is no farther removed from God or incapable of receiving the illuminations of grace than the greatest philosopher or the most learned divine So that if men are content with believing only  What  God requires  of them as necessary to salvation they may safely rely on him and the ordinary means of providence for instruction  The case is different with those who to gratify even a laudable curiosity are inquisitive about circumstances and doctrines unessential to salvation The object of that curiosity is a worldly object and if attained must be attained by worldly means They who possess not the means of original pursuit therefore must be content as a certain author expresses it  to receive the object of it at second hand but the faith necessary to salvation is no such  stale bargain  it is the  immediate gift  of God  Our author would have the inattentive and illiterate receive this gift at the hands of  man  and because uninformed reason is not to be depended on in  matters of faith he advises them to rest their dependence on the information of those who professedly deduce what they know from the exercise of their reason "They" says he  that is the inattentive and illiterate should all  remember what perhaps they never knew  that in all sciences even in mathematics  themselves    itself  there are many propositions which on a cursory view appear to the most acute understandings uninstructed in  that science  to be impossible to be true which yet on a closer examination are found to be truths capable of the strictest demonstration and that therefore in disquisitions on which we cannot determine without much learned investigation reason uninformed is by no means to be depended on and from hence they ought surely to conclude That it  may be at least as possible for them to be mistaken in disbelieving this revelation who know nothing of the matter as for those great masters of reason and erudition Grotius Bacon Newton Boyle Locke Addison and Lyttleton to be deceived in their belief a belief to which they firmly adhered after the most diligent and learned researches into the authenticity of its records the completion of the prophecies the sublimity of its doctrines the purity of its precepts and the arguments of its adversaries a belief which they have testified to the world by their writings without any other motive than their regard for truth and the benefit of mankind  In a matter of so great importance we pay no authority even to great names Without uncharitably questioning  however either the sincerity or the motives of the several avowed defenders of Christianity certain it is that  some  of them have been secretly contemners of its doctrines and privately disbelievers of its divine original  It is indeed justly to be suspected that the number of these is much greater than is generally imagined for however widely religious infidelity may have spread itself moral hypocrisy hath in the present age kept pace with it  Religious masquerading  hath in fact become so general and unbelievers so numerous that they keep one another in countenance while with unparallelled effrontery they take off the mask and openly belie the characters they assume Thus our modish Christians wear the plain face of downright heathens  while they retain the domino or outward garb of Christianity  This they do by explaining away as our author observes the plain and obvious meaning of scripture and modelling the articles of faith agreeable to their own imagination And yet these very underminers of genuine Christianity who are daily sapping its foundation and preying on its vitals keep flourishing away with their misrepresentations of its prosperous and flourishing state  "If Christianity" say certain bold Reviewers in their critique on the pamphlet before us  had been an imposture it could never have maintained its credit for almost eighteen hundred years or stood the test of the most acute and accurate examinations of friends and enemies of wits and infidels critics and philosophers  of all denominations some fundamental defect some irreconcileable contradiction or some gross absurdity must have been discovered But this is so far from being the case that the more it is considered the more it convinces every new enquiry produces new light new evidence and from every fresh attack it gains an additional triumph  What an impudent abuse of the good faith of the Christian reader what an insolent attempt to impose on his credulity  Do not these very critics themselves pretend to have discovered fundamental defects irreconcileable contradictions and gross absurdities in the primitive and orthodox tenets of Christianity Do they not ridicule the doctrine of the Trinity Do they not deny the  Divinity of our Saviour Do not they reject the tenets of vicarious atonement justification by faith and almost every essential article in the Christian creed And do they still pretend that the mutilation of its very being is gaining additional triumphs to its cause Shame on such baresaced irony  We should not think it worth while to notice here even this gross misrepresentation of things by  such  anonymous critics as they are at present sunk deservedly so low in the general esteem of the public but as they have heretofore stood in much higher estimation and persons ignorant of their degeneracy might put the same confidence in them as formerly we think a landmark should be placed on the accumulating shoal lest the unwary mariner should suppose himself in a  deep  when he is barely floating on a  shallow  If any of their old friends are desirous to remain undeceived we leave them to make their own discovery in which case they will find themselves much in the situation of Sancho Pancha when his ass being stolen from under him while he was asleep he waked and found himself mounted merely on a packsaddle    The real state of the case is quite otherwise genuine Christianity notwithstanding the vapouring of these nominal Christians being never at so low an ebb as it is among our modern rationalists surviving chiesly among those who are ridiculed as contemned visionaries enthusiasts and fanatics The truth is that so far has pure Christianity been from profiting by the freedom of enquiry with which its doctrines have of late years been treated that it has really lost ground among all the advocates for such enquiry  It is an idle boast that a mere belief in the mysteries of religion will stand the test of ridicule and defy the powers of rational investigation Those mysteries themselves will undoubtedly do it because they depend not on the credulity or credibility of men but on the unchangeable promises of God But we see daily the most plausible professional characters laughed out of their religion and even the warmest zealots argued out of their zeal  Ridicule  though not the test of  truth  is thus often the test of our adherence to it  So that if we were to calculate to how small a number of people genuine Christianity is at present confined we shall have no reason to boast with this author the extent of its propagation and influence and still much less to advance it as a proof of its divine original  It must be owned indeed that our author does not much boast of its  present  state Comparing it with the  ancient  he says  If it is asked why should not the belief of the same religion now produce the same effect the answer is short because it is not believed  VIEW page The writer's meaning is plain though not accurately expressed unless an  indirect  answer only was intended to the question    Happily for Christianity it hath a much firmer support in the promises of its divine author than in any rational arguments that can be produced from such circumstances and happily for real Christians their faith hath a more unfailing resource in the operations of divine grace than in the most fertile expedients of human reason  SECT XIII  On his reply to the seventh objection  That the whole scheme of Revelation is partial false fluctuating unjust and unworthy of an omniscient and omnipotent Author  THIS objection is conveyed in such diffuse and desultory terms that it amounts to little more than what has before been urged viz that the whole is incredible and bears no internal evidence of its divine original  And indeed if we suppose human reason to be a competent judge of the  divinity  of Revelation and also of what is  worthy  or  unworthy  an omniscient and omnipotent Being the objection stands in its full force  But we deny this competence as indeed does our author who observes that though  Reason is undoubtedly our surest guide in matters which lie within the narrow circle of her intelligence  she is greatly deficient when she proceeds farther  God says this selfsufficient teacher reason is perfectly wise just and good and what is the inference That all his dispensations must be conformable to our notions of perfect wisdom justice and goodness but it should be first proved that man is as perfect and as wise as his Creator or this consequence will by no means follow  See View p    But says our author on the subject of revelation her province is only to examine into its authority and when that is once proved she has no more to do but to acquiesce in its doctrines  We have before hinted that we think reason has at least as much to do in the one case as in the other we shall now therefore only observe on this head that the  Monthly  Reviewers conceive it to be a very unguarded and dangerous position "It precludes" say they "and discourages all rational inquiry  Monthly  Review for June p    Doubtless it does and properly all rational inquiry on a subject that does not admit of rational inquiry  But say they  if it were pursued it would justify the wildest enthusiasm or superstition  How will an  acquiescence  or the putting an implicit faith in the  doctrines  of the scripture lead to the wildest enthusiasm and superstition Is the human mind when directed by divine revelation  more apt to err than when under the simple influence of reason  These learned and ingenious gentlemen if indeed any gentleman ingenious or learned  still continues  to write in the  Mouthly  Review seems to think that Reason has still  wilder imaginations  than those imputed to it by our author  We have already observed that in our opinion it is the duty of Christians to submit the dictates of reason as well with respect to the authority of the scriptures as the truth of its doctrines to the influence of divine grace and it would be but modest in our rival Reviewers to leave to the author of the foundation of our faith the care of its superstructure  They may rest assured that whatever extravagancies of enthusiasm or superstition men have fallen into it has not arisen from their putting an implicit  faith in the doctrines of scriptures in other words from their submitting their reason to revelation but to their indulging in the pride of their hearts the wantonness of their imagination and  trying  their  reasonable practices  on such doctrines  SECT XIV  General Reflections on the whole argument and conclusion in favour of universal candour in judging of the faith and morals of others or the exertion of Christian charity toward all mankind  HAVING thus assigned our reasons for thinking the human understanding a very incompetent judge either of the mysteries of our holy religion or of the proof of its divine origin we  shall add only a few cursory reflections respecting the state of the argument in general  And first let us observe that were we disposed to take away even the slightest prop on which the popular belief of revelation rests we might expose to the greatest ridicule those vain boastings of vaunting casuists who declaring the truths of christianity to be sit objects of rational investigation invite the attacks of argument wit and ridicule and boldly bid them defiance Among these we may particularize as of late the most eminent and conspicuous that ingenious and justly celebrated philosopher Dr Joseph Priestly and his very able coadjutors in the theological repository  It was with a very bad grace also the celebrated author of the  Divine  Legation  made a similar boast and threw out the same defiance against the freethinkers while the civil power was actually up in arms to crush one of the dullest and inoffensive insects of the whole tribe poor old Peter Annet It was certainly a glorious triumph over infidelity and a fine proof of the clerical faith in the impregnability of the Christian church the getting a decrepid dotard of eighty sentenced to be imprisoned in Newgate pilloried in the public streets and condemned to beat hemp in Bridewell for a twelvemonth and all merely for pushing a few pitiful pellets out of the popgun of his wretched goosequill against the credibility of the Mosaic history of the plagues of Egypt  Why was not the artillery of the ecclesiastical fortress levelled at some more formidable foe in their opposition  to whom those doughty engineers might have reaped some credit for their valour if not for their conduct and have at least escaped the odium which ever falls on  cowards  for their  cruelty  They may rest however secure the ashes of poor Peter will remain quiet in his grave We dare say there was not so much spirit buried with them as to cause any future disturbance either to him or them  We are assured that a late Archbishop of Canterbury thought the punishment of this poor man so much greater than his crime that he allowed him a stipend for life after he had submitted to and undergone the sentence of the law  The dignisied ecclesiastic abovementioned has been bold enough to say in some of his prefaces that the freethinkers as they are falsely stiled  have had fairplay in the argument that they have been left at liberty to handle the weapons of offence and defence at pleasure and yet have been foiled  But this is not true The  freethinkers  never had fairplay given them nor in fact do they deserve it if it were prudent in the civil magistrate to indulge them They are in general as little actuated by candour and the love of truth as their antagonists are by the detestation of falshood and it must be owned of the  latter  they do for the most part love a  little deception  DEARLY  The writer of this critique can as truly aver his sincerity as the author of the pamphlet which is the subject of it He can truly say that with the most ardent desire of reconciling revelation to reason he long and laboriously  attached himself to the study of the scriptures and the reading of the commentators that with the most earnest with to find the doctrines of christianity true and its divine origin morally evident he attended with the utmost candour to the authorities of ancient historians and the arguments of modern reasoners  And yet though early instructed to pay the most profound reverence and put the most implicit faith in the orthodox doctrines of Christianity the more closely he applied the criterion of reason the more clearly did that criterion appear to be inapplicable The farther advances he made in human science the less compatible he found it with divine knowledge  He felt by no means the force of argument respecting the divine mission of our Saviour either from the  completion of prophecies or the effect of miracles The history of the former seemed too problematical and legendary while the latter appeared to have had much less effect than they might reasonably be supposed to have on the very persons who were eyewitnesses of them  It appeared to him that the credit of Christianity was so little established and even the name of its divine institutor so little known in its very birthplace and infancy that the magistrates themselves speak of  one Jesus  Acts xxv It is true that this depreciating mode of expression is used by Festus a new governor just come into office but it does not appear that King Agrippa himself whom Paul compliments with being expert in all customs and questions then among the Jews knew any thing more of  this Jesus  than the governour Paul indeed would fain have persuaded him that he knew much more of the matter than he did or at least would seem to do he could not persuade him however to acknowledge himself a Christian when he was not For that seems to be the true meaning of the passage as it seems the boldness and artfulness of the insinuation caused Agrippa to get up and walk away  as of  an obscure and unheardof stranger and of his sacrifice on the cross as a doubtful event  It appeared to him that if there were any thing supernatural in the propagation of Christianity it lay in its subsequent progress in opposition to the incredulity of the times and the inefficacy of the miracles of Christ and his apostles to diffuse a more general and earlier belief Next to this he conceived the strongest proof that  could be brought of the divine origin and of a supernatural interposition in the establishment of Christianity is that the enormous wickedness of its later professors the flagitious the inhuman methods of propagating it together with the apparent absurdities contained in its mysterious tenets have not been able to bring it altogether into discredit even in the most scientific ages and with the most rational and humane nations of the world  Here  is  indeed  the appearance of something supernatural the fulfilling of the divine founder's promise to the Christian church that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it It is to an overruling providence and the irresistible power of grace in the completion of this promise as before observed more than to the strongest rational  arguments that Christianity owes its permanence and protection  Depended its sacred mysteries on the force of  reason  what can be more  rationally  advanced in defence of the incarnation of  Jesus  than of the incarnanations of  Vistnou  Depended they on  rational  arguments in favour of their  truth  What could  reasonably  be said in favour of a  God  the author of  life  becoming subject to  mortality  To his being  born  of a  woman  though  not begot  by a  man  To his  dying  the death of a  sinner  to  atone  for the  sins  of the  saints  to his descending into hell and his ascending again to heaven to reassume after all the pristine glory of the Deity  If there be any thing in any religion more revolting to human reason than this we are unacquainted with  the greatest  apparent  absurdities in the known world  If we are asked then whether as  mere rational  beings we can believe such propositions we frankly answer noAnd yet experimentally convinced how short is the line of the human understanding how inadequate the strongest powers of sense and genius to penetrate the veil of nature and of providence we can readily submit our reason to revelation and give our unfeigned assent as  Christians  to the truth of propositions which as  men  and  philosophers  we can neither fully understand nor clearly conceiveBelieving though not on any rational conviction that  faith  or as our author properly describes it an assent to the essential doctrines of Christianity is a religious duty enjoined every man who lives under the dispensation of the  gospel we believe even as  men  so much of them as we comprehend persuaded that even what we do not comprehend would command our belief if we did in the same proportion  We can unfeignedly do this even while the  truth  as it is called of such mysterious propositions appears doubtful nay while even the terms of such propositions appear in part or altogether unintelligible  It is a favorite maxim with our modern rationalists or as some call them  divines  that  where mystery begins religion ends  This maxim is in our opinion so far from being applicable to the  Christian  religion that we think the  faith  of the Christian applicable chiesly to its mysteries with which it begins and ends  There would indeed be something mysterious in the promulgation even of the  morals  of Christianity if we could be brought to believe the practice of them in their declared  purity  to be in our present state required of us a practice so diametrically opposite to the gratification of the appetites and passions of human nature and even to the laws of justice and equity admitted in natural religion  To submit to every insult to return good for evil to love those that hate us and wish well to them that despitefully use us  are tenets so contrary as well to our natural impatience of injuries as to our ideas of natural justice that however the meekspirited and graceendowed individual may adopt them in private practice no community of Christians ever yet  dared to admit them into their system of civil policy  As to the  Faith  of the Christian if it be not exercised on the mysteries of his religion we see neither use nor merit in his belief If he believe nothing but what appears rational and probable nothing but what is evinced by a cloud of witnesses and carries with it the clearest conviction in what is it more meritorious than the creed of the skeptic or infidel for even  they  have their  creed  "Because thou hast seen me faith our Saviour to Didymus thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed"  We think this text perfectly applicable to such as like our author are anxious to prove the divine authority of the Scriptures by rational argument in doing which we think  them just as ill employed as this writer says they would be in pretending to accommodate the scriptural doctrines to our natural ideas of rectitude and truth  The welldisposed reader therefore submitting his  Reason  to  Revelation  and his belief of its divine origin as well as of its essential doctrines to a superior mode of conviction the influence of Grace would do well patiently to wait the effect of its operation in God's own place and time and not be importunately anxious for the elucidation of obscurities which nothing but divine illumination can illustrate  For after all what men generally mean by the  truth  of the doctrines of revelation is their consonance or congruity with the deductions of commonsense and mere unenlightened reason  The trulydevout need be under no apprehension of being guilty of a neglect of religious duty in thus patientlywaiting for that inspiration from above which only can make them wise unto salvation  In the mean time they should not be surprized nor alarmed at finding their notions of divine truths not exactly to coincide with those of other men of whose talents gifts or graces they may entertain a higher opinion than they do of their own  As there are few if any persons in the world that either hear see or feel external objects exactly alike our nervous systems being as diversified as our features so there are as few that conceive exactly alike the meaning of any one moral or religious proposition even divine inspiration itself accommodating  its influence to the different faculties of the individual  This reflection above all others should excite us to the exercise of that Christian charity which covering a multitude of sins we should throw as a veil of universal candour over the mistakes and errours of the rest of mankind justly suspecting that with regard to others more enlightened than ourselves we may stand in need of the same indulgence  THE END  REASON AND GRACE THEOLOGICAL  LOGUE  The reader who has not been offended at the few verses quoted in the foregoing pages will not be displeased at the insertion of this apologue first prefixed to the fourth edition of the epistles to Lorenzo beforementioned  DO Christian Heathens still complain  That  infidels  our creed profane  Yet harbour doubts so dark and nice  They were in infidels a vice  Religion  do they still pretend  Where  mystery  begins must end  And yet affect in  revelation  To trace the means of man's salvation  O'er errour let the truth prevail  The truth though treated as a tale  High on th' imperial throne of grace  Where angels view their Maker's face  As fondly in imagination  Men give him local habitation  Tho' nature's universal mind  By time and place is unconfin'd  Through clouds that canopy his throne  Seen by the eye of faith alone  Conceal'd the Christian Deity  Sat veil'd in awful mystery  With anxious heart and listening ear  Alternate slave to hope and fear  Devotion  blind a pagan bred  To visionary notions led  With spirits of fantastic birth  Had pester'd heav'n and peopled earth  In ev'ry stream thro ev'ry grove  Did nayad swim or dryad rove  On ev'ry whirlwind terrour rode  And spoke the presence of a god  His breast with human passions fraught  As folly dreamt or errour taught  Till cautious  reason  scarce could tell  The gods of  heav'n  from those of  hell  'Twas now the one true God supreme  Dispersing darkness like a dream  From heav'n directed  revelation  Beneath the Christian dispensation  Those truths to teach which left alone  To  reason  MAN had never known  For 'tis by different means we trace  The works of  nature  and of  grace  Degen'rate minds in contradiction  Full oft from rational conviction  Yet  Reason  piqu'd with envious pride  At sight of this transcendent guide  Affected much to scorn her aid  And scoff'd at the celestial maid  As if by simple nature given  The special privilege of heaven  Whence they who gospeltruths believe  The same implicitly receive  By  grace  intuitively taught  Without the aid of puzzling thought  Without the use of studied rules  Without the logic of the schools  Without the means that  art  supplies  Or  science  making blockheads wise  For human wisdom here at fault  Its solemn forms are set at nought  While thro the wide world's narrow bounds  Mere foolishness the wise confounds  In heaven's own manner time and place  Hence Christians wait the call of grace  Whose operation from on high  Nor wit nor learning can supply  The  skeptic  yet devoutly vain  Because he bows at nature's fane  Tho' ne'er the unregen'rate mind  May  nature  's GOD behold enshrin'd  Persists with scrutinizing eye  By logic gospeltruth to try  To make the sapience of the sage  The standard of the sacred page  And take for heaven in worldly pride  A carnal for a spiritual guide  Hence each by  reasoning  led astray  Perversely takes a different way  T  o' the same chart they all pretend  Directs them to their journey's end  Cease ye discordant skeptics cease  The  gospel  is the word of  peace  Its  myst'ries  taught the human race  Alone by heav'ninspiring  grace  The  sophist  poring in the dark  Still syllogizes wide the mark  The  Christian  takes the book in hand  And where he may not understand  Nor hesitates nor blindly pores  But reads believe admires adores  The diff'rence then with me admit  Betwixt  divine  and  human  wit  This  but for this world's purpose given  That  to direct the way to heaven  To Caesar pay great Caesar's due  And take his coin for sterling true  But dig not Caesar's richest mine  To mix its ore with gold divine  Lest worse designing ChristianJews  The dangerous precedent abuse  Adulterate with new allay  And clip and sweat it all away  It has been objected that this apprehension is groundless if the scriptural promises respecting the stability of the Christian church are to be depended on But this objection is founded on misapprehension A particular people may forfeit thro' infidelity their title to that church without affecting its general stability or prosperity as experience hath evinced There cannot also be a more fatal prognostic of Christianity's forsaking any country than its being reduced to a mere  name  among its pretended professors for such we presume is the  paganized  Christianity as Bishop W calls it prevailing in the present day  ERRATA  Page Note line for  France having  read  France Having  P Note line for
