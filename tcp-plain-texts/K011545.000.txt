 THE NORTHERNSTAR A POEM  Written by Mr  HILL  LONDON Printed for  E Berington  at the  CrossKeys  near  Essexstreet  End in the  Strand  and  J Morphew  near  StationersHall MDCCXVIII Price One Shilling  THE PREFACE To Mr  POPE  SIR  I  Am so little inclin'd to trouble even Men of Merit with the Address of such Trifles as These that it was impossible I shou'd so much as have thought of Yourself with that View if Honest  Bernard  your Bookseller had not inform'd me That You I suppose it was out of the Fulness of your known Zeal for our Church and Constitution had taken upon you to assert that Printing any thing in Praise of the  Czar  of  Russia  wou'd be receiv'd as a Satyr on the Government  'Tis possible that under this Disguise of Opinion Your Excess of Goodbreeding may have conceal'd your Dislike of the Performance for I find it a Difficulty to conceive how so whimsical an Objection cou'd come into a Head so well stor'd with Judgment as we are to conclude Yours to be from Your  Essay on Criticism  Let either of these sage Cases be the Right I consider their Importance as Equal and take this Occasion with a Frankness like Your own to assure You that my Esteem for Your  Genius  as a Poet is so very considerable that it is hardly exceeded by my Contempt of Your Vanity  What led me to embrace an Opportunity of knowing Your Opinion was a Disposition which two Lines in Your  Essay  abovemention'd shall explain for me  Trust not Yourself but Your Defects to know  Make Use of Ev'ry FriendAnd Ev'ry Foe  I cou'd not I confess consider you as a  Friend  having that very great Misfortune to languish under of not being reckon'd in the Number of Your Acquaintance But in the  Last  of the two Lights I presum'd I might regard You since Mr  Dennis  for whose Skill in Judging I profess an Esteem has assured us that You are a Kind of  Foe  to every Body but Yourself and on that Foundation supports his rough Attempt  to pull the Lyon's Skin from a certain little Ass  he there mentions and I fear he means You Sir  When I consider'd You in this Character I made no doubt but any Poem wou'd have had the Good Fortune to come out of Your Hands well examined that I shou'd have heard of  Rough Verse  improper  Sentiments  and a World of  Poetical  Errors But I profess Your Penetration overshot all my Fears and I cannot find Words to express my Astonishment at Your Capacity when Mr  Lintott  lisp'd out That Mr  Pope  said  there were several good Things in the  NorthernStar  BUT it would be taken for an Insult on the Government FOR tho' the  Czar  is King  George  's Ally yet we are likely to quarrel with  Sweden  and  Muscovy whisper'd Bernard  lies he says in the North  If this pleasant Discovery was Your Real Opinion we must I'm asraid learn to  pity  the Weakness of a Judgment which I know is Heroic enough to wish rather for  Envy tho' a sturdier Passion and agree with You heartily that  A  Little Learning  is a dangerous Thing  But if you dislik'd the Poem as a Poem why did you not fairly avow the Disrelish I could have own'd a Conviction of Error with the same Satisfaction I feel when I repay a Civility Shall I put you in Mind that Dislike not own'd openly stands condemn'd by a Judge whose Sentence Mr  Pope  of all Mankind will be the last to appeal from  Be Niggards of Advice on no Pretence  For the worst Avarice is that of Sense  With mean Complacence ne'er betray your Trust  Nor be so civil as to prove unjust  Pope  's Essay on Criticism  I must by no Means imagine that a supercilious Result from Neglect of examining into the Merits of a Cause he pretends to decide can he charg'd with any Justice on the Author of the following Lines unless he was religious enough to write them with Design to lash himself by Way of Penance  Of all the Causes which conspire to blind  Man's Erring Judgment and misguide the Mind  What the weak Head with strongest Byass rules  Is  Pride  the neverfailing Vice of Fools  Whatever Nature has in Worth deny'd  She gives in large Recruits of needful Pride  In short if I writ Verse often enough to make my Vanity Rampant I should shrewdly suspect that you were mightily taken with this Poem since you thought it worth your while  to give it an ill Charàcter for You▪ who rever iie have told the World and I suppose you assert Nothing but from Your own Knowledge  That still the Worst with most Regret Commend  And each bad Writer is as bad a Friend  And while SelfLove each jealous Writer rules  Contending Wits become the Sport of Fools  But if I was not afraid that You wou'd think me Illnatur'd I wou'd observe in your Favour on this Occasion that tho' all these foregoing Verses are Your own Words they way posibly be very different from Your Sentiments for I remember that among the rest You tell us by Way of Warning  That Men of Wit may their own Rules invade  As Kings dispense with Laws themselves have made  I will therefore take Advantage from my having been pretty conversant with your Writings to seek a better Reason yet for the Oddness of your Notion that this  NorthernStar  is a Satyr on the  Government  Your abovemention'd Cabinet of Sentences is so well furnished that like a Masqueradeshop at  Venice  it will give a Man what Face he pleases in a Twinkling but I presume I have hit the Right Nail when I stop at the following  Simile  All seems infected that th' infected Spy  As all looks Yellow to the Jaundic'd Eve  But however tho▪ as  Teague  in the Comedy finds his Mouth run from one Side to the other and cannot for his Life say  Ladyship  to Mrs  Day  without laughing in her Face I cannot without much Difficulty grow Grave when I compare the Judge with the Sentence yet to allow all possible fair Quarter let us suppose that the  Czar  as He is not were now actually our EnemyAre his Merits less shining Does His Glory depend on His Friendship for  Britain  Contemptible Meanness of Thought Is it necessary towards becoming a  Patriot  among the  English  that every Thing must be hated that is▪  Foreign  At that Rate the  toto divisos orbe Britannos  wou'd be more applicable to our Humour than it is to our Sitvation  Next to deserving well ourselves it is the noblest Perfection of Nature to admire and applaud those who do so But to have no Ear open to Renown at a Distance were base vain and brutal equally distasteful to Humanity and Wisdom We may talk what we please of our  Natural Advantages  There is one  Natural Defect  which will shadow them All and which makes it impossible to widen our Power till we enlarge our Conceptions  I am apt to believe that Nothing has contributed more to this Narrowness of Mind than the Flatteries of our Poets who generally writing for a precarious Subsistance can no Way so easily succeed as by falling in with the Weakness and Byass of Mens Natures and hence all our Women are Nymphs Angels or Goddesses our Men DemiHero's all our Soldiers are invincible all our Generals beyond  Caesar  all our Kings like  Augustus  and every Lord who has a Penny in his Pocket and a Crotchet in His Imagination a very  Mecaenas  A Poet shou'd sometimes stand high and look wide for a Subject If He is always Domestic He will be often unnatural  Virgil's  celebrated Praise of his  Italy  had been Falshood and F  attery apply'd to  Great Britain  He knew and admired the Delights of His Country and acted as became Him when he justly commended them But our HighwayPoets whose utmost Reach of Skill is a  Poor Imitation  forget that they make  Themselves  contemptible▪ instead of ornamenting their Subject when Peace in  our  Climate is dress'd in her  Olives  when  Pan  fills our Woods and  Tritons  our Seas and our Shepherds  sit Piping  like the Swains of  Arcadia  A meer Poet that is to say a Wretch who has nothing but the Jingle in his Brain to ring Chimes to his Vanity and whose whole Trade is Rhymejobbirg such a Creature is certainly the most worthless Incumbrance of his Country His Arrogance is the only Thing more Remarkable than his Ignorance The fantastical Merit that swells him is like other IllHumors▪ the more noxious for its Thinness Useful Science is an Air much too Gross for His Intellects Biting Scorn and Universal Neglect turn their Points on His Conceitedness and while the whole World strives in vain to correct him by Disgrace and Reproaches All that Tempest to Him is no more than Blowing Wind in a Bladder the stronger the Puff the more boisterous the Swelling  All this Mr  Pope  must reeds know between his double Capacity of  Poet  and  Critic  and if so He has given a Judgment as well corrupt as ridiculous in attributing to  Party  the Endeavours of  Justice  But if after all it was not the  Subject  but the  Poem  that found no Favour in His Eyes I will take upon me to assure Him it sues not for the Blessing Let him like it as ill as He pleases I dare at least undertake it shall easily defend it self against any Attack of His making which pray Sir inform Him since you are His greatest Admirer and oblige  Your Most Humble Servant A HILL  THE Northern Star A POEM  BORN in an Age when Virtue's Vigour fails  Where Praise is  Dumb  or  Speaks  as Change prevails  Where strugling Courage stoops to Want's Controll  And Fortune's ev'ry Tide o'erwhelms the Soul  Where hardpress'd Poverty the Contest flies  And with low Flatt'ry shameful Succour buys  Where illjudg'd Worth by Pow'r and Wealth is weigh'd  And servile Poets make their  Art  a  Trade  Rise Genr'ous Muse And let the Wand'rers know  'Tis base to Praise where they no Praises owe  That Justice scorns an undue Fame to sell  And Nothing claims Renown but Doingwell  That He dishonours Verse who bows his Theme  To Great Mens Fortune or to Rich Mens Phlegm  That thro' all Forms the Muse shou'd  Merit  trace  A Blessing unconfin'd to Rank or Place  That Narrow Minds conceive not Virtue right  And Worlds not Realms shou'd be the Poet's Flight  Extend thy Truthplum'd Wings Unbyass'd Muse  Discern with Caution but with Boldness chuse  If in some dusky Corner thou shalt find  A ragged Fortune hide a noble Mind  Disperse the Cloud and be the Labour thine  To teach such shamefac'd Virtue how to shine  Or where thou seest some wealthy Churl withhold  Th' enliv'ning Use of His imprison'd Gold  If meanly Proud the Wretch disdains to weigh  The Wise Man's Wants against the treasur'd Clay  With pointed Satyr pierce his stubborn Soul  Till Sense of Shame does Pride of Heart controll  O'er Statesmens Actions keep a watchful Eye  The Stains they make assume the blackest Dye  If rais'd by Chance some Wretch not form'd for Sway  Exerts the Cover'd Beast and hunts for Prey  If all untaught in Pow'r He drives with Rage  And blust'ring shakes His temporary Stage  Whisper unwelcom Notice in His Ear  That where Abuse spreads wide Revenge is near  But stay To nobler Aims address thy View  And mark the mighty Deeds which Monarchs do  Their Good Example sways unfix'd Mankind  And dimey'd Princes make whole Nations Blind  When Godlike  Caesar  rul'd Ungrateful  Rome  And Budding Empire shot a fragrant Bloom  His Virtues made those Slaves more blest than He  Who Murder'd  Him  to be unsafely Free  When Bloody  Nero  fill'd That  Caesar  's Throne  Corrupted Justice durst no Virtue own  Degen'rate  Rome  became the Villain's Post  And He was safest there whose Guilt was most  Undreading therefore when Occasion calls  Enter Proud Palaces Imperious Walls  There Good or Ill detect the reigning Fact  For Truth is Truth however Princes act  Sublimely fir'd I snatch the Glorious Aim  'Tis Great indeed to give the  Royal  Fame  But where O Spotless Light of Reason's Eye  Where among Princes shall I Virtue spy  Shall my own Sov'reign's Praise enrich my Lines  NoWith known Force Domestick Glory shines  Vain were the Thought and needless the Design  To say to Angels Heav'n is all Divine  Northward unbridl'd Muse Direct thy Flight  Where a New Sun adorns the Land of    Night  Where Arts and Arms a Rising Empire  sound  Doom'd to refine the World and Girt it round  Thou Mighty  CZAR  in that    Contracted Name  Shalt outweigh  Caesar  in thy Pow'r and Fame  Led by thy Forming Hand Victorious still  And almost Newcreated by Thy Skill  Intrepid Legions wait thy Doomful Nod  As Hosts from  Moses  watch'd the Will of God  Thou God like Object of my Muse's Praise  Thou Best Invok'd Inspire my Rising Lays  Kindle my Glowing Soul with Fire like Thine  And lend me  Bluze  to make Thy Wonders shine  Tho' right to mark How tow'ring Eagles fly  Requires the Sharpness of an Eagle's Eye  Tho' Highrais'd View does best a Prospect show  Which He can Ill describe who stands too low  Yet if aspiring to the Theme I find  Thy Glory's Lustre strike my op'ning Mind  O Prince the Grateful Arrogance forgive  No Genuine Muse so charm'd can silent live  Perish that narrow Pride from Custom grown  That makes Men blind to Merits not their own  Briton  and  Russian  differ but in Name  In Nature's Sense All Nations are the same  One Universe claims One Creator's Care  And Man is Reason's Subject Everywhere  While untrac'd  Nile  with swelling Torrent strays  And Oozy Wealth in Annual Floods conveys  Memphia  's rich Plains confess'd Improvement know  And to the spreading Stream Huge Harvests owe  Yet does not  Egypt  singly praise the  Nile  Which greatly partial does on  Egypt  smile  Egypt  and All the World the River claim  Egypt  in Influence and the World in Fame  So  Russia  nearest feals the Inbred Heat  But the warm'd World the distant Brightness greet  Ages obscurely pass'd unmark'd by Fame  Had almost robb'd this Empire of its Name  Unmeasur'd States lay hid in noiseless Reign  And  Russia  took up half our World in vain  Weakly inspir'd the Mass did slowly roll  Like some huge Giant with a Pigmy's Soul  Till Ripening Time an Equal  Genius  sent  Divinely siz'd to suit the vast Event  He  breath'd Prolific Vigour o'er the Land  And moulded Order with his skilful Hand  The swelling Energy of Pow'r spread wide  And bore down proud Obstruction like a Tide  In sudden State a dreadful Empire rose  Which Late no Hope and Now no Danger knows  In Marble Quarries thus to swell their Gain  Men blow up hollow Rocks with nitrous Grain  Too weak at first the Blast oft fails its End  And frustrate Clouds with forceless Flash ascend  But when well suited to the Cavern's Size  A stronger Heap th' experienc'd Artist tries  No more in vain th' expandid Thunder breaks  But bursting All impetuous Passage makes  The groaning Mountain Nods with rugged State  And yields reluctant to its forceful Fate  The Cave unroof'd with sudden Splendor bright  Glitters with mingled Rocks and Newborn Light  Did not O Prince Thy Love of Art's soft Charms  Ungrind the keener Influence of thy Arms  Well might the Jealous World malign Thy Sway  And anxious wink against Thy Stream of Day  But Thy Great Soul has taught Thee that the Brave  Wish not to conquer but with View to save  That 'tis a Monarch's Task to steer his Reign  Betwixt the wild Extremes of  Mean  and  Vain  To curb Presumption's Childhood with Restraint  And punish Treason while 'tis call'd Complaint  The noblest Way to make His Subjects  Free  They safe in Property in Empire  He  Knowledge with Joy should consecrate to Fame  The lucid Clearness of Her Champion's Flame  His Doublegrasping Hand at once displays  The Martial Laurel and the Peaceful Bays  Beneath His Shade where no bold Tempests blow  Safely they twine together as they grow  Not so of old when fierce in horrid Arms  The needy North pour'd forth Her  Gothick  Swarms  Roughly they warr'd on Worth they could not taste  And blindly laid the Tracks of Learning waste  This Heav'n remembred and with Kind Command  Call'd for Attonement from the barb'rous Land  The Conscious Prince Disdainful of the Crime  Guiltless springs forward to Uncurse His Clime  And nobly vows to teach the Nations more  Than the World's Empire Ruin'd Lost before  Illustrious Nature Fitly fram'd for Pow'r  So Gods for Incense did their Blessings show'r  So  Russia  's Chief Himself a God in This  Rewards Subjection with unmeasur'd Bliss  How vast the Engine And the Force how Great  That can so swiftly move such Pond'rous Weight  Enormous Man who while His boundless Sway  O'erspreads a Crowd of Nations ev'ry Way  Measures not Greatness by His Country's Length  Nor will to kneeling Millions owe His Strength  But Heav'nlike Selfdependent Vigour shows  And  gives  not  takes  what Pow'r from Number flows  Divinely stor'd with Views and rich in Schemes  For Loading Fame with everlasting Themes  With Glories He Enamels o'er a Land  Which almost ow'd Distinction    to His Hand  From frozen Climes where Nature stiff with Cold  Nourish'd no Hope and without Joy grew Old  Warm'd by the Monarch's Worth we rising saw  A Spring of Virtue and a Bloom of Law  Doubly supreme This Prince with wide Controll  Directs the Body and impow'rs the Soul  While Common Kings their Views supinely scan  And measure what they  Will  by what they  Can  Thou do'st at once with overpow'ring Sway  Command and make Men Able to Obey  Transporting Thought Let me indulge thee long  Thou shew'st what Cause makes Crowns and Kingdoms strong  No more by Civil Broils let Nations bleed  For fancy'd Benefits they do not need  Those Subjects the most Glorious  Freedom  share  Whom  We  call  Slaves  in such a Sovereign's Care  Slaves are low Wretches who deceiv'd by Names  Promote unknowingly their Spoiler's Aims  Who dream Rebellion makes a Nation free  And hug new Chains mistook for Liberty  Till waking into Thought they miss their Gain  And kick against some FellowTraytor's Reign  If just  Athenians  by their  Theseus  led  Theseus  who gave their scatter'd Limbs a    Head  In lasting Praise embalm'd His cherish'd Fame  When Nought of His was left 'em but His Name  If wise  Licurgus  is immortal grown  He whom  Laconia  Proudly call'd Her own  Whose worship'd Ghost kept Living Pow'r in Awe  And gave a long Descent of Hero's Law  If  Romulus  lives Glorious to this Day  For pointing out to  Rome  her future Way  For calling Courage in from Private Harms  To mightier Mischief in united Arms  What Praise Prodigious Prince Shall dare to tread  In awful Circles near thy sacred Head  To whom not one small Portion singly kneels  In Thanks for sep'rate Benefits it feels  But Nations    Numberless as  Lybian  Sands  Adore the Bounties of thy Reaching Hands  Thy Hands to whom Delighted with thy Praise  God gave not Lands to Govern but to Raise  Newblown Ambition fires each Northern Soul  And thaws the Icy Influence of the Pole  The shaggy    Samoid  shaking off his Snow  Warms His cold Breast with New Desire to  Know  The rugged  Tartars  from whose swarthy Bands  A Gloom of Horror us'd to shade Thy Lands  Charm'd with Thy Virtues bow before Thy Throne  Assume new Natures and fix'd Dwellings own  New Beams of Learning active as the Wind  Now first break out and light up Half Mankind  Dark Superstition like a Mist dispell'd  Quits a Dominion thro' Long Ages held  And  Russian  Arms a glitt'ring Terror cast  O'er Lands where scarce the  Russian    Name has past  Shame on the Bards of our degen'rate Days  Who prostitute to  Gain  their sullied Lays  Who think it needless for a Muse to roam  And poorly place their whole Regard at Home  The World's my Country Born no matter where  Man is a Denizen of Earth and Air  The  Just  who in full Light All Merit show  Love ev'n the Hostile Virtues of a Foe  Weak with Astonishment my Verse pursues  And flags beneath this tow'ring Prince's Views  Where are the lost Effects of Statesmens Wiles  Whose illschem'd Policy the World beguiles  How have they vainly beat one devious Road  And sigh'd at Growing  France  with false Forebode  While Unobserv'd th' exulting Northern Bear  Grin'd over Universal Empire  there  Thence sudden Fleets have shadow'd distant    Seas  With Pow'r selfraised and Scorning slow Degrees  At Pleasure they descend on Ev'ry Shore  And starting Nations hear new Thunder roar  The  Swede  alarm'd does Fortune's Change upbraid  And sees th' assaulted Enemy invade  Th' assisted  Dane  learns Jealousy from Fear  And hates his Helper's Strength display'd too near  The furrow'd  Baltick  a Third Lord obeys  And to strange Keels Unwilling Homage pays  The Virgin    Caspian  This bold Lover woo's  Nor vainly for Her envy'd Favour sues  Already won She has Her Love confest  And giv'n Him Leave to wander o'er her Breast  Persia  's heap'd Wealth will Her huge Portion be  And Eastern Kings shall give  Her  Lord the Knee  A Rival Pow'r in Naval Struggle    try'd  And stretch'd along the stormy  Euxine  's Side  Has taught the  Porte  's Imperial Walls to shake  And shall the  Sultan  's Iron Scepter break  Grecia  's lost Fame shall be restor'd by Thee  O Monarch Doom'd to set an Empire free  Yok'd    Hellespont  whose Stream submissive glides  Indignant and a conquer'd World divides  Shall see while thence Thy bursting Thunder roars  Europe  and  Asia  trembling to Her Shores  Thence may the floating Tow'rs which boast thy Sway  Newgreet their  Russia  by an    untry'd Way  While thus thy awful Pow'r more awful grows  They swell Thy Glory who Thy Aims oppose  The selfpriz'd Lords of  China  's boasted Land  Feel their Pride    faint beneath thy Pow'rful Hand  The Trackless Wilds which both vast States divide  Are yearly ev'n when arm'd with Winter try'd  O'er Realms of Snow thy fearless Sleds can fly  And bring at Ease the dreadful Distance nigh  In vain oppos'd their longfam'd  Wall  they see  It keeps them  In  but cannot keep  Out  Thee  Zemla  's High Cliffs Eternal Hills of Frost  Where proud Discov'ry has so oft been    lost  Thro' all the Ages of the World till now  Have check'd the Keels that wou'd those Oceans Plough  Like Nature's Barrier's they all Search withstood  And bound Ambition up in freezing Blood  Reserv'd by Fate and for thy Reign design'd  Thy piercing Eye shall the wish'd Passage find  Or to the Western World the Eastern join  And see the Profit and the Glory Thine  Stop Headstrong Muse And e'er we Higher go  Look down with Caution on the Depth below  Prospects so vast the Rash Approacher fright  And dazling wound the uncollected Sight  Congratulate a while the promis'd Gain  And with  some Joy  relax Thy Wonder's Strain  Shall then at last beneath propitious Skies  The Cross triumphant o'er the Crescent rise  Shall we behold Earth's longsustain'd Disgrace  Reveng'd in Arms on  Osman  's haughty Race  Shall modern  Greece  shake off a Captive's Shame  And look unblushing at Her Antient Fame  Shall Orphans cease in vain lost Bliss to know  And curse the thriving Authors of their Woe  Shall Widows old in Chains their Offspring save  And weep lamented o'er their Husband's Grave  'Twill be Prophetic    Greece  rehopes HerOwn  And Hails Her  Caesar  on the  Russian  Throne  Athens  again shall teach  Corinth  aspire  And  Theban  Breasts glow with rekindling Fire  Once more  Bizantium  destin'd long to shine  Shall rear the ruin'd Name of  Constantine  Transcendent Prince How happy must thou be  What canst thou look upon unbless'd by Thee  What inward Peace must Thy brave Bosom know  Whence Conscious Virtue does so strongly flow  The Toil of Ages past in Ruins lies  How welltim'd therefore does Thy Greatness rise  To shew how swiftly destin'd Glory climbs  And build Examples for succeeding Times  Such are the Kings who make God's Image shine  And justly dare assert their Right Divine  No Earthborn Love of Rapine whets their Will  Or tempts their Pow'r Unhostile Blood to spill  But mindful with what Hope Wise Men obey  They show'r down Comforts from their gentle Sway  To raise the Humble They extend their Hand  And chase Oppression from their Rescu'd Land  With wellweigh'd Justice They both sheath and draw  The Sword of Battle and the Sword of Law  Skill'd in the Means They never miss the End  But govern Cool what They with Warmth defend  How blest were Man wou'd Heav'n hereafter please  That all Earth's Princes shou'd be form'd like These  Wish it O Muse howe'er the Wish be Vain  It gives some Joy to hope th' unlikely'st Gain  Let me at least the fancy'd Change create  And hug the Prospect of a Bliss too Great  Say Muse What Happiness from Thence might flow  And what Improvement wou'd blind Fortune know  Were such the Happy State of Nations made  No silent Modesty wou'd Merit shade  The Rays of Honour scatter'd wide about  Wou'd reach to Virtue or enquire Her out  Distressful Innocence wou'd Shelter sind  And Sense of Mis'ry make the  Mighty  kind  A faithful Minister Each Post wou'd fill  Not rais'd by Faction but preferr'd for Skill  The Judges Bench by Justice crown'd with Awe  Wou'd break that Bulk of Form which blunts the Law  Wou'd from Oppression cleanse the Road to Right  And clear the Films of Brib'ry from Men's Sight  Truth always own'd wou'd need no Help from Pow'r  Nor Rich Mens Wills the Poor Man's Wants devour  Distinguish'd Distribution wou'd arise  And to Deserve wou'd be to Win the Prize  Thou  Russian  Star That makes the  Pole  outshine  The Torrid Brightness of the Burning  Line  Drawn by Thy beamy Force I still wou'd gaze  But my Eyes ake beneath th' oppressive Blaze  Descend Rash Muse From the bold Theme retire  Thy Fall were dang'rous if thy Flight were higher  Forbear Great Prince nor with such Swiftness bless  Shook by our Fears we wish Thy Merit less  Say what new Heights were left for Thee to try  If as thy Fame thy Body cou'd not die  And Heav'n will scarce thy  Nowmourn'd  Absence bear  When Earth yields no New Labour worth Thy Care  But while amaz'd Thy Miracles we trace  Teach us where first we shou'd our Wonder place  Hard the Decision Which Most Honour won  Thy Actions or the Speed with which they're done  When  Rome  that Glitt'ring that Immortal Name  Aspir'd to Rule and panted after Fame  Age copying Age strove with progressive Will  To push the same Design with Equal Skill  And when Eight    hundred Lab'ring Years were past  The late propitious Fortune smil'd at last  Not such slow Rise O Prince Thy  Russia  fears  Thou see'st not Glory thro' such Depth of Years  At once resolv'd at once the Columns rise  Which lift thy dreadful Fabrick to the Skies  Form and Degrees let Earthy Spirits need  Thy Soul Excentric moves with inbred Speed  Makes Nature shake and raises in a Day  What with less Ease in Ages shall decay  So when young Time in Chains Existence kept  And huddl'd Nature in dark  Chaos  slept  Th' Eternal Word to set Distinction free  But spoke th' Almighty  Fiat  Let there  Be  Millions of Ways the  starting  Atoms flew  Like  clung to  Like  and sudden Order grew  Sruggling in Clouds awhile Confusion lay  Then dy'd at once and lost it self in Day  Explanatory NOTES Referr'd to in the POEM  I Call  Russia The Land of Night  not only  Literally  as its general Distance from the Sun occasions tedious and uncomfortable Winters but also in a  Metaphorical  Sense because an almost total Absence of the Arts till this  Czar  's Reign had wrapt the Country in a Night of Ignorance    In that Contracted Name Czar  is a Contraction of the Word  Caesar  and is us'd to signify a King or Emperor not only in the  Russian  Tongue but the  Sclavonian  and some others and no doubt deriv'd its Rise from that Title of the  Roman  Emperors Nor is there any other Difference in the Words than the Contraction only since the antient Latin Pronunciation was not  Caesar  as we speak it but the  C  being pronounc'd as a  K  made  Kaisar  and in that Manner it was undoubtedly spoken by the  Romans  The Germans have no other Title for the Emperors to this Day than  Kaisar  which the smallest Variation changes into  Czar  according to the  Russian  Appellation    Almost ow'd Distinction to his Hand  Tho' the  Czars  of  Russia  have for many Ages been possess'd of very large Dominions and a Power as extensive and unbounded as most other Princes yet partly by their distant Situation and partly by their Want of Skill in Arms and Arts it is certain that they are but lately become Known to these Parts of  Europe  and were never formidable 'till they ow'd it to the Genius of their present Monarch    Gave their scatter'd Limbs a Head  Every Body knows that  Theseus  gather'd the  Athenians  into a Body from a dispers'd and solitary Way of living and founded and peopled the City of  Athens  which was before but a little Village tho' a Kingly Seat where he brought them to a Relish of Society and usefully instructed them in the Knowledge of improving their united Power    Nations Numberless as Lybian Sands  The  Hyperbole  may plead more than Poetical Licence to excuse it for if according to the Practice of Great Part of the  East  and the  WestIndies  each distinct  Tribe  or  Herd  may be indulg'd in their Ambition to be thought a particular  Nation  as most Writers have practis'd Then may the petty  Herds  of  Tartars  almost every where surrounding  Russia  added to the wild Variety of Inhabitants in  Siberia Samoieda c  who depend upon the  Czar  be call'd  Numberless  without much Help from the  Hyperbole    The Shaggy Samoid  The  Samoiedes  are a People subject to the  Czar  and inhabiting a large Tract of Land from  Nova Zemla  to the Neighbourhood of  Archangel  and extending along the  Tartarian  Sea They neither Plough nor Sow their Country being too cold to produce Corn so that they live chiefly on dry'd Fish and Turneps and the Flesh of a Kind of Deer which feeds on the Moss of their Heaths And with the Skins of these Deer having a very thick warm Fur they cloath and defend themselves from the Sharpness of the Frost and covering themselves all over keep the Snow from blowing in at their Necks and live three Months in the Year without Sight of the Sun    O'er Lands where scarce the Russian Name has past  Notwithstanding the just Notion which  Europe  has conceiv'd for some Years past of the formidable Power of the  Russian  Arms yet is their Country so little known to the Generality of other Nations that it is almost Universally called  Muscovy  tho' that is only the Name of its old Capital  Muscow  And the  English  might with the same Justice in foreign Countries be called by no other Name than The  Londoners    Thence sudden Fleets have shadow'd Distant Seas  It is known that the  Cza  has on a sudden cover'd the  Baltick  with a powerful Fleet of Men of War and Gallies which was sufficiently seen when He transported His Army to join with the King of  Denmark  in the intended Descent upon  Schonen  And on the other Side of His Dominions He has built a Fleet against the  Turks  to serve upon the  BlackSea  most of which Ships being of very great Force were built at  Veronize  a Town seated on a Branch of the famous  Tanais  and falling into the  Palue Maotis  not far from the City of  Azoph    The V  rgin Caspian  The  Czar  has caus'd Ships to be sent down the  Volga  into the  CaspianSea  to make Discoveries on the Side of  Georgia Persia Armenia  and independant  Tartary  and a considerable Trade for the Products of the  EastIndies  is already carried on from several Ports in that Sea to  Astracan  and thence dispers'd over  Russia  by the  Volga  and the  Don  This Sea is call'd the  VirginCaspian  because it has no known Communication with any other being the largest Lake in the Universe about five hundred Miles long and in Breadth four hundred and by Means of this Sea the  Czar  has at all Times an Inlet into the Heart of  Pers  a  and the  Indies  whenever he shall think of extending His Conquests that Way    A Rival Power in Naval Struggle try'd  The  Turks  'till the Reign of this Illustrious Prince the  Czar  possess'd Entire Dominion in the  Euxine  But the  Russian  Fleets can now dispute their Title and of this the  Turks  have had Experience ever since the Year when the Loss of  Azoph  was the Consequence of an Overthrow at Sea by the  Russian  Gallies commanded by the  Czar  in Pers  n The Terror this Defeat occasion'd at  Constantinople  was so great that they built new Castles on the  Bosphorus  and took all possible Precautions to prevent some future Attempt that Way by the  Russian  Navy but so much in Vain that I am convinc  d and could justify it by Reason and Demonstration that if the  Czar  shou'd as it is now likely he will declare War against the  Turks  he may with the smallest Expence or Hazard imaginable begin his Success by laying  Constantinople  in Ashes or possessing it if he pleases and maintaining it against all possible Efforts of the  Ottoman  Power    Yok'd Hellespont  The Passage of this famous Chanel is guarded and made as the  Turks  falsly believe impossible to be forc'd by two old Castles called the  Dardanelles  one seated on the  Asian  Side the other on the  European  about three Quarters of a Mile asunder and having each a Platform of prodigious outofSize Artillery carrying Stone Bullets of two or three Foot Diameter    Now greet their  Russia  by an untry'd Way  If  Constantinople  were in the Hands of the  Czar  and the  Hellespont  by that Means subject to Him His Ships from the South Parts of His Dominions bordering on  Circassia  might thro' the  Bosphorus Propontis Hellespont  and  Aegean  pass into the  Mediterran an  and coming thro' the Streights Mouth sail  Northward  and reach  Russia  again at the Port of  Archangel    Feel their Pride shake  c The  Chinese  tho' vastly distant from  Russia  have been warr'd upon by that Nation and made to conceive very different Idea's of them from those which their Pride had before suggested to them And the  Czar  duely sensible of the many Advantages which may arise from a perfect Discovery of that Immensity of Desart which divides Him from  China  has compleated that Design and built Forts and large Towns all the Way at proper Distances for the Defence and Entertainment of His Subjects who travel every Year from one Empire to the other by Land carrying out and bringing back such Commodities as are most in Demand by the Merchants of both Nations They set out when the Winter has cover'd all the Country with Snow and the Surface of that Snow is so harden'd by Frost that they are drawn with great Swiftness over it in Sleds by a large Kind of Deer they who ride in the Sled being cover'd with thick and warm Furs for Defence against the Severity of the Cold    Where Proud Discov'ry has so oft been lost  Abundance of Ships have been lost and great Numbers of excellent Mariners been frozen to Death in the Search of a North Eastern Passage to  China  and  Japan  by the Way of  Nova Zemla  and the great Sea of  Tartary  If there is such a Passage as there must be unless the  Russian  Dominions are join'd on the North to  America  The  Czar  has a Design to discover it and will undoubtedly succeed in it because His Situation affords him an Advantage which no other Monarch is Master of    Prophetic Greece rehopes Her own  There has long been a Prophecy among the  Greeks  that their Redemption from the  Turkish Yoke  shall be owing to a fair white hair'd People from the North and they are strongly and universally perswaded that the  Russians  are the People meant in the Prophecy    And when eight hundred lab'ring Tears were past  Tho' the  Romans  assisted by the Strength of their National Virtue in the Infancy of their Power grew suddenly Glorious yet they reach'd not the Height of their Empire till the Days of  Trajan  which Summit of Authority is hinted at by the  Aspiring to Rule  and  Panting after Fame  in the Poem  FINIS
