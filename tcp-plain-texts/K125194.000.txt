 An Answer to a Paper concerning Mr  De Foe  against his History of the UNION  SIR  I Herewith send you a Paper full of scurrilous Reflections upon Mr  De Foe  and upon his Work called  The History of the Ʋnion  pretended to be done in Defence of Mr  Clark  who it seems is thought to be Injur'd in the Account there given of the Tumult at  Glasgow  I am very sorry to find a Stranger so Treated among us in  Scotland  who I think has on many Occasions in his Writings very well deserved of this Nation But I am still more concerned that this Malignity of the Pen should proceed to such a scurrilous Piece especially in pretending to Defend a Gospel Minister who if he Retains any of the Temper of his Master will think himself very little Obliged to the Person that has Wrot it to Defend him in so Rude and Indiscreet a manner as it must be owned becomes no Modest Man to do  This Occasions me to hope notwithstanding the General Opinion of the People here that Mr  Clark  himself has no hand in it For first as the Truth of it will want very strong Confirmation and is impossible to be made out so the Language of it would be more Reflection upon a Gospel Minister than any thing Mr  De Foe  can have Wrot concerning him  The Scripture Rule laid down by the Apostle for a Minister is so manifest in this case and so expresly forbids to return  Railing for Railing    and Reviling for Reviling  that Mr  Clark  if he sees this Paper or any Body is so kind to him as to shew it him can not but clear himself from being concerned in it in Honour to his own Reputation  But this is worse still  for to Revile without being Reviled is a part which no Honest Man will render much less a Minister of the Gospel Reverend for Learning Grave in Years and Sober in Education such as Mr  Clark  But I wave all this perswading my self Mr  Clark  can have no Hand in such a wretched Piece of Railing and Falshood and hasten to speak in short to the matter of Fact which is all that requires an Answer in this Paper the other being too Gross to deserve any Notice  As to Mr  De Foe  's Work in a History of the Transactions of the Union many People here of the best Capacity to Judge have been Witnesses to the Preparations he has made for it and can Testify for him in his Absence That he has been very Careful has taken a great deal of Pains and been at a great Expence to perform the Promise made in the Introduction and which this Person Quotes  viz  to Write with Impartiality and Truth  That he being gone away for  England  left the Sheets behind him to the Inspection of Persons in our own Countrey of Unbyass't Principles and Unspotted Reputation to whose Revising and Correction he submitted every thing he had Wrot and therefore it can not be Suggested that he has designedly made any Errors to make up History or Printed any thing that Merits this Authors hard Words but on the contrary while Mr  De Foe  has Undertaken the Writing an Impartial History of Fact he could not be so weak as to think that those People who perhaps acted a part in that Affair which they may have Reason since not to be pleased with in themselves should be pleased with his relating it however Impartially And therefore I doubt not he Expected all the ill Usage he finds from Persons whose Actions will not bear a clear Representation  As to the Errors I am sorry the Author that pretends to be Mr  Clark  's Defender can find out so few real ones that he is fain to speak what is so far from being to be Justified that I dare say Mr  Clark  will not owne it himself  Mr  Clark  as a Minister of the Gospel can not be Guilty of so much Prevarication as to say himself that he did not speak the Words Mr  De Foe  has Quoted and I make no scruple to assure the World that he did speak the very Words  at least  without Variation of the Sense And there are so many living Witnesses now in the City of  Glasgow  and some of them here in this City at this time who heard the Words spoken that it is something which few People can Understand must move this Author to deny that for him which so many People know is matter of Fact and is so easy to be Proved  Wherefore the Gentleman who Wrot this scurrilous Paper is desired to Reflect a little and go and ask Mr  Clark  about it I dare say that Reverend Person is a Man of too much Conscience and Honesty not to Acknowledge the Words and if his Memory should fail him so much as not to Remember the Words he will no doubt Refer to his Notes and find it there just as is related or with very little Difference  viz Addresses will not do and Prayers will not do there must be other Methods it is true Prayer is a Duty but we must not rest there  c  Wherefore up and be Valiant for the City of our GOD  And that the Reader may not depend upon the single Testimony of this Paper I may refer him to some of the Chief Inhabitants of  Glasgow  many of whom were then in the Church and will I make no Question be such Friends to Truth and to the Stranger that is Abused as to make it out  Further if the Author of this Paper now meant can Engage Mr  Clark  to bring this matter before the Assembly which is now Sitting as a Charge of Slander by Mr  De Foe  I do Promise in his Absence to bring unquestioned Witnesses before the said Assembly to prove the said Words upon him and till he does so Mr  De Foe  can not be Charged with Slandering him  It is plain also the Paper it self acknowledges  the Fact  tho he Couches it as if he were asham'd of it  saying    that  Mr  Clark  Cited  Chron    Sam  but does not think fit to put down the Words of the said Texts which are as follows  Arise therefore and be doing and the LORD be with thee  And  Be of good Courage and let us play the Men for our People and for the Cities of our God and the LORD do that which seemeth him good  Indeed he was right crafty to hide these Words  For had Mr  Clark  said no more than this it had answered all Mr  De Foe  alleages which he also expresses with as much Tenderness to Mr  Clark  as could be  viz That this was Constructed by the Rabble to excite them to Tumults  and who could say less or what could that People think who were before Irritated about their Addresses being refused but that when he said  ARISE AND BE DOING be of good Courage and play the Men  and at last  Ʋp and be Valiant  but that he meant they should take Arms  c  Now in Order to do Mr  De Foe  some Justice in this I must necessarily observe How odd it is for this Author to publish this Scurrilous Pamphlet on a Man that he knows to be absent and not able to reply to him Against a Book that is not yet published that so the People being ignorant of the manner of expressing it may believe all he says and by what clandestine way he has come to the sight of the imperfect Sheets I dare say he will be ashamed to owne  However as I think Mr  De Foe  as a Historian could not have been faithful to the Matter of Fact no nor to the Magistrates and good People of  Glasgow  who were then misrepresented to the whole Island  nay to their Sovereign too  and lay under the Scandal of a Factious Mutinous People without relating the Steps by which that Tumult grew up as the honestest way to Vindicate them So I think he has been so far from reproaching or abusing Mr  Clark  that he took all the Precautions possible to prevent his Readers supposing Mr  Clark  did it in Design  As to what Connexion of Circumstances there might be to render his Design suspected to others Mr  De Foe  uses him most discreetly And if in one Line he calls him a Weak Good Man which is the utmost they can pretend I forbear for his own sake to enter into an Enquiry here whether it were a Weakness  in him  AT THAT TIME  to use such Expressions or no referring it to them who know what Influence his Words  however well and innocently design'd  had upon the People and how within one Hour after they were spoken the whole City was in an Uproar and Confusion I am sure it is a Weakness in any of his Friends to bring him thus on the Stage again at such a time as this especially  Let them consider of that as they like  But that you may not take my Word for Mr  De Foes  discreet Usage of him I shall quote the Words in his History as he has printed this Case and let any Man judge if he has used the Reverend Minister ill or no His Words are thus  P  and which if fairly quoted his Paper would have answer'd it self  "On  Thursday  the  day of  the Fast appointed by the Commission of the Assembly was kept in  Glasgow  Mr  C  k  Minister of the Trone Kirk Preached from the Words in  Ezra    And I proclaimed a Fast at the River of  AHAVA  that we might afflict our selves before our GOD to seek of Him a right Way for us and for our little Ones and for all our Substance  '  'I shall convince the Gentleman concerned that this Account is not made for a Satyr upon him 'tis too serious a Subject and when both he and those who heard him reflects on how much more his Unhappy Temper at that time forc'd from him than I set down here all which I have by me  verbatim  as he spoke it he will I say be convinced that I talk no more than in the Obligation of a Historian to Truth of Fact I am bound to do'  'I am not at all apprehensive of having the Truth of these Words questioned having received them from the Mouths of more than two or three of the principal Inhabitants of  Glasgow  who heard them spoken and if the misplacing a Word should be snatcht at  I venture to say  that this was the full Purport of the Expression without the least Variation as to the Weak Good Man that spoke them I will not suggest that he foresaw the Consequence of them or had any such thing in his Design tho it calls for some Charity to guess his Meaning The kindest thing I can say of them is that he did not mean at all what followed but spoke in his Haste for God forbid I should suggest he mean'd to raise a Rebellion and to bring his Country into all that Blood and Confusion  which if GODs Goodness had not prevented it had certainly followed'  'The Sermon ended about eleven a Clock and the People were so Enflamed before that by one of the Clock the Mob were gotten together their Drum was Beat in the Back streets and all the Confusions we are now to speak of followed'  Thus far the History speaks and here any Man may see how Discreetly Mr  De Foe  has used Mr  Clark  how he has Declared over and over that he does no way Charge his Design  And that is more than all the People of  Glasgow  will do tho' they have as much Respect for their Ministers as other People  Nay he Endeavours to clear him  so much as  of foreseeing the Consequence and in that gives him the Stile of  Weak Good Man  if this Author will not have him to be a Good Man  that is none of Mr  De Foe  's fault  and if he will not own his Weakness in ill Timeing that Discourse Mr  Clark  is very little oblig'd to him For it certainly must be Owned as a Weakness or Justified as a Design and let him take it which way he pleases  There is a seeming Error indeed in Printing the Word  Of  for  After  But Mr  De Foe  is cleared of this Effectually for that he left a Blank for the Day of the Month to be filled up at the Press which they have still left open and his Original Copy being here in Town to refer to makes it out The  Errata  also at the Revising of the Sheets supply it all which this Accuser it seems has not seen but speaks without Book  For the Words being Read either way are Right even by his own Charge thus  First For on  Thursday  the Day of the Fast Read on  Thursday  the Day after the Fast  Mr  De Foe  knew as well as the scurrilous Author the Fast was on a  Tuesday  and therefore Printed the  Thursday  which was the Day of the Sermon and cannot fairly be supposed to mean the Fast Day and so secondly the Blank being filled up it will be right another way thus  On  Thursday  the of  November    the day after the Fast  Who would believe such a shift as this should be made use of as a Refuge to protect the rest of the Allegations It is the matter of Fact not the Day of the Month that is material and that is but foully wiped off indeed  As to Persons dealing with the Provost of  Glasgow  before this Sermon about Addressing which he calls a fourth Error The Provost is a Man of too much Candor to assist their Suggestions and it is Referred to him to Determine whether it be Truth or no let them Enquire at the Peril of their Credit  The third Charge is a full Test of the Honesty of this Author and may direct any Honest Man to make a Judgment of him  P    Par  he says  His  De Foe  's third Error is P  That about one of the Clock after Sermon ON THE FAST DAY the Mob got together and Beat up the Drums  This cannot be Mr  Clark  he has more Honesty he would not have spoken so without Book he dar'd not to impose such abominable Falsity on the World  at least I hope so  for in Mr  De Foe  's Book  the Sheet lying now before me  and as quoted above it is nothing so The Words are thus  Sermon being ended about eleven of the Clock by one of the Clock the Mob were gotten together their Drum was Beat  c and this is true  Let any Man judge of the rest of this Sheet by this  Specimen  and therefore I think this may serve for a full Answer to his mighty  Book of Errors  for such indeed it may be justly esteem'd  All the rest of his Paper is filled with Fire and Brimstone Abusing the Magistrates of  Glasgow  and Railing at Mr  De Foe  who if he was here perhaps might speak for himself But this I must say for him That whereas he pretends to Charge him with Reproaching a Minister of the Gospel  If the Author of that Paper had read out that part of the History of the Union which Treats of the Management of the Ministers of  Scotland  he will find Mr  De Foe  has done the Ministers  in general so much Justice and their Characters so much Honour in that Book as well as on all Occasions in his other Writings as will sufficiently Evidence him to be both a Reverencer of their Office a Lover of their Persons and a Friend to their Interest  As to his Reflections on the History it self in general which he strives to Disparage tho' he has not seen it he is referr'd to  Solomon  who Mr  Clark  can tell him ranks them among his Fools who judge of a Matter before they hear it His Motion to have the Government suppress it shows his Good Will to Mr  De Foe  on one hand and which if he were here no Question he would Laugh at sufficiently but on the other is a Satyr on his Friend Mr  Clark  as if he were ashamed his Actions on that Occasion should come to the View of the World  And indeed Mr  Clark  I think will have little Reason to Thank him for what he has done in this Case for that I shall take effectual Care in the Vindication of Truth to have a more particular Account of that whole Case put into this History this Mr  De Foe  at first design'd wherein the Accuser may have further Occasion of Vindicating some Body who is generally thought to have had but bad Luck formerly at Vindicating himself  As to the Rude and Indiscreet Language given him in the Paper as it justly offends the Ears of the Hearers and fouls the Mouth of the Reader so I shall observe the Method Mr  De Foe  himself takes in all such Cases  i e  Take no notice of it it is not worth while it hurts the Author not Mr  De Foe  in the least only this I must say as my own Observation in all Matters of Debate  Wise Men Argue and Fools Rail  Edinburgh  Printed by the Heirs and Successors of  Andrew Anderson  Printer to the Queens most Excellent Majesty
