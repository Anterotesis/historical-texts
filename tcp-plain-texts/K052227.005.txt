fontes  VIRG  LONDON  Printed by W BOWYER for BERNARD LINTOT between the  TempleGates    THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The seventh Battle for the Body of  Patroclus  The Acts of  Menelaus  MEnelaus  upon the Death of  Patroclus  defends his Body from the Enemy  Euphorbus  who attempts it is slain  Hector  advancing  Menelaus  retires but soon returns with  Ajax  and drives him off This  Glaucus  objects to  Hector  as a Flight who thereupon puts on the Armour he had won from  Patroclus  and renews the Battel The  Greeks  give Way till  Ajax  rallies them Aeneas sustains the  Trojans Aeneas  and  Hector  attempt the Chariot of  Achilles  which is borne off by  Automedon  The Horses of  Achilles  deplore the Loss of  Patroclus  Jupiter covers his Body with a thick Darkness The noble Prayer of  Ajax  on that Occasion  Menelaus  sends  Antilochus  to  Achilles  with the News of  Patroclus  's Death Then returns to the Fight where tho' attack'd with the utmost Fury he and  Meriones  assisted by the  Ajaxes  bear off the Body to the Ships  The Time is the Evening of the eight and twentieth Day The Scene lies in the Fields before  Troy  THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  ON the cold Earth divine  Patroclus  spread  Lies pierc'd with Wounds among the vulgar Dead  Great  Menelaus  touch'd with gen'rous Woe  Springs to the Front and guards him from the Foe  Thus round her new fal'n Young the Heifer moves  Fruit of her Throes and Firstborn of her Loves  And anxious helpless as he lies and bare  Turns and returns her with a Mother's Care  Oppos'd to each that near the Carcase came  His broad Shield glimmers and his Lances flame  The Son of  Panthus  skill'd the Dart to send  Eyes the dead Hero and insults the Friend  This Hand  Atrides  laid  Patroclus  low  Warrior desist nor tempt an equal Blow  To me the Spoils my Prowess won resign  Depart with Life and leave the Glory mine  The  Trojan  thus The  Spartan  Monarch burn'd  With generous Anguish and in scorn return'd  Laugh'st thou not  Jove  from thy superior Throne  When Mortals boast of Prowess not their own  Not thus the Lion glories in his Might  Nor Panther braves his spotted Foe in Fight  Nor thus the Boar those Terrors of the Plain  Man only vaunts his Force and vaunts in vain  But far the vainest of the boastful Kind  These Sons of  Panthus  vent their haughty Mind  Yet 'twas but late beneath my conqu'ring Steel  This Boaster's Brother  Hyperenor  fell  Against our Arm which rashly he defy'd  Vain was his Vigour and as vain his Pride  These Eyes beheld him on the Dust expire  No more to chear his Spouse or glad his Sire  Presumptuous Youth like his shall be thy Doom  To wait thy Brother to the  Stygian  Gloom  While yet thou may'st avoid the threaten'd Fate  Fools stay to feel it and are wise too late  Unmov'd  Euphorbus  thus That Action known  Come for my Brother's Blood repay thy own  His weeping Father claims thy destin'd Head  And Spouse a Widow in her bridal Bed  On these thy conquer'd Spoils I shall bestow  To sooth a Consort's and a Parent's Woe  No longer then defer the glorious Strife  Let Heav'n decide our Fortune Fame and Life  Swift as the Word the missile Lance he flings  The wellaim'd Weapon on the Buckler rings  But blunted by the Brass innoxious falls  On  Jove  the Father great  Atrides  calls  Nor flies the Jav'lin from his Arm in vain  It pierc'd his Throat and bent him to the Plain  Wide thro' the Neck appears the grizly Wound  Prone sinks the Warrior and his Arms resound  The shining Circlets of his golden Hair  Which ev'n the Graces might be proud to wear  Instarr'd with Gems and Gold bestrow the Shore  With Dust dishonour'd and deform'd with Gore  As the young Olive in some Sylvan Scene  Crown'd by fresh Fountains with eternal Green  Lifts the gay Head in snowy Flourets fair  And plays and dances to the gentle Air  When lo a Whirlwind from high Heav'n invades  The tender Plant and withers all its Shades  It lies uprooted from its genial Bed  A lovely Ruin now defac'd and dead  Thus young thus beautiful  Euphorbus  lay  While the fierce  Spartan  tore his Arms away  Proud of his Deed and glorious in the Prize  Affrighted  Troy  the tow'ring Victor flies  Flies as before some Mountain Lion's Ire  The village Curs and trembling Swains retire  When o'er the slaughter'd Bull they hear him roar  And see his Jaws distil with smoaking Gore  All pale with Fear at distance scatter'd round  They shout incessant and the Vales resound  Meanwhile  Apollo  view'd with envious Eyes  And urg'd great  Hector  to dispute the Prize  In  Mentes  Shape beneath whose martial Care  The rough  Ciconians  learn'd the Trade of War  Forbear he cry'd with fruitless Speed to chace  Achilles'  Coursers of aethereal Race  They stoop not these to mortal man's Command  Or stoop to none but great  Achilles'  Hand  Too long amus'd with a Pursuit so vain  Turn and behold the brave  Euphorbus  slain  By  Sparta  slain for ever now supprest  The Fire which burn'd in that undaunted Breast  Thus having spoke  Apollo  wing'd his Flight  And mix'd with Mortals in the Toils of Fight  His Words infix'd unutterable Care  Deep in great  Hector  's Soul Thro' all the War  He darts his anxious Eye and instant view'd  The breathless Hero in his Blood imbru'd  Forth welling from the Wound as prone he lay  And in the Victor's Hands the shining Prey  Sheath'd in bright Arms thro' cleaving Ranks he flies  And sends his Voice in Thunder to the Skies  Fierce as a Flood of Flame by  Vulcan  sent  It flew and fir'd the Nations as it went  Atrides  from the Voice the Storm divin'd  And thus explor'd his own unconquer'd Mind  Then shall I quit  Patroclus  on the Plain  Slain in my Cause and for my Honour slain  Desert the Arms the Relicks of my Friend  Or singly  Hector  and his Troops attend  Sure where such partial Favour Heav'n bestow'd  To brave the Hero were to brave the God  Forgive me  Greece  if once I quit the Field  'Tis not to  Hector  but to Heav'n I yield  Yet nor the God nor Heav'n shou'd give me Fear  Did but the Voice of  Ajax  reach my Ear  Still would we turn still battle on the Plains  And give  Achilles  all that yet remains  Of his and our  Patroclus  This no more  The Time allow'd  Troy  thicken'd on the Shore  A sable Scene The Terrors  Hector  led  Slow he recedes and sighing quits the Dead  So from the Fold th'unwilling Lion parts  Forc'd by loud Clamours and a Storm of Darts  He flies indeed but threatens as he flies  With Heart indignant and retorted Eyes  Now enter'd in the  Spartan  Ranks he turn'd  His manly Breast and with new Fury burn'd  O'er all the black Battalions sent his View  And thro' the Cloud the godlike  Ajax  knew  Where lab'ring on the left the Warrior stood  All grim in Arms and cover'd o'er with Blood  There breathing Courage where the God of Day  Had sunk each Heart with Terror and Dismay  To him the King Oh  Ajax  oh my Friend  Haste and  Patroclus'  lov'd Remains defend  The Body to  Achilles  to restore  Demands our Care Alas we can no more  For naked now despoil'd of Arms he lies  And  Hector  glories in the dazling Prize  He said and touch'd his Heart The raging Pair  Pierce the thick Battel and provoke the War  Already had stern  Hector  seiz'd his Head  And doom'd to  Trojan  Dogs th'unhappy Dead  But soon as  Ajax  rear'd his tow'rlike Shield  Sprung to his Car and measur'd back the Field  His Train to  Troy  the radiant Armour bear  To stand a Trophy of his Fame in War  Meanwhile great  Ajax  his broad Shield display'd  Guards the dead Hero with the dreadful Shade  And now before and now behind he stood  Thus in the Center of some gloomy Wood  With many a Step the Lioness surrounds  Her tawny Young beset by Men and Hounds  Elate her Heart and rowzing all her Pow'rs  Darko'er the fiery Balls each hanging Eyebrow lowrs  Fast by his Side the gen'rous  Spartan  glows  With great Revenge and feeds his inward Woes  But  Glaucus  Leader of the  Lycian  Aids  On  Hector  frowning thus his Flight upbraids  Where now in  Hector  shall we  Hector  find  A manly Form without a manly Mind  Is this O Chief a Hero's boasted Fame  How vain without the Merit is the Name  Since Battel is renounc'd thy Thoughts employ  What other Methods may preserve thy  Troy  'Tis time to try if  Ilion  's State can stand  By thee alone nor ask a foreign Hand  Mean empty Boast but shall the  Lycians  stake  Their Lives for you those  Lycians  you forsake  What from thy thankless Arms can we expect  Thy Friend  Sarpedon  proves thy base Neglect  Say shall our slaughter'd Bodies guard your Walls  While unreveng'd the great  Sarpedon  falls  Ev'n where he dy'd for  Troy  you left him there  A Feast for Dogs and all the Fowls of Air  On my Command if any  Lycian  wait  Hence let him march and give up  Troy  to Fate  Did such a Spirit as the Gods impart  Impel one  Trojan  Hand or  Trojan  Heart  Such as shou'd burn in ev'ry Soul that draws  The Sword for Glory and his Country's Cause  Ev'n yet our mutual Arms we might employ  And drag yon' Carcass to the Walls of  Troy  Oh were  Patroclus  ours we might obtain  Sarpedon  's Arms and honour'd Corse again  Greece  with  Achilles'  Friend shou'd be repaid  And thus due Honours purchas'd to his Shade  But Words are vainLet  Ajax  once appear  And  Hector  trembles and recedes with Fear  Thou dar'st not meet the Terrors of his Eye  And lo already thou prepar'st to fly  The  Trojan  Chief with fixt Resentment ey'd  The  Lycian  Leader and sedate reply'd  Say is it just my Friend that  Hector  's Ear  From such a Warrior such a Speech shou'd hear  I deem'd thee once the wisest of thy Kind  But ill this Insult suits a prudent Mind  I shun great  Ajax  I desert my Train  'Tis mine to prove the rash Assertion vain  I joy to mingle where the Battel bleeds  And hear the Thunder of the sounding Steeds  But  Jove  's high Will is ever uncontroll'd  The Strong he withers and confounds the Bold  Now crowns with Fame the mighty Man and now  Strikes the fresh Garland from the Victor's Brow  Come thro' yon' Squadrons let us hew the Way  And thou be Witness if I fear to Day  If yet a  Greek  the Sight of  Hector  dread  Or yet their Hero dare defend the Dead  Then turning to the martial Hosts he cries  Ye  Trojans Dardans Lycians  and Allies  Be Men my Friends in Action as in Name  And yet be mindful of your ancient Fame  Hector  in proud  Achilles'  Arms shall shine  Torn from his Friend by right of Conquest mine  He strode along the Field as thus he said  The sable Plumage nodded o'er his Head  Swift thro' the spacious Plain he sent a Look  One Instant saw one Instant overtook  The distant Band that on the sandy Shore  The radiant Spoils to sacred  Ilion  bore  There his own Mail unbrac'd the Field bestrow'd  His Train to  Troy  convey'd the massy Load  Now blazing in th'immortal Arms he stands  The Work and Present of celestial Hands  By aged  Peleus  to  Achilles  given  As first to  Peleus  by the Court of Heav'n  His Father's Arms not long  Achilles  wears  Forbid by Fate to reach his Father's Years  Him proud in Triumph glitt'ring from afar  The God whose Thunder rends the troubled Air  Beheld with Pity as apart he sate  And conscious look'd thro' all the Scene of Fate  He shook the sacred Honours of his Head  Olympus  trembled and the Godhead said  Ah wretched Man unmindful of thy End  A Moment's Glory and what Fates attend  In heav'nly Panoply divinely bright  Thou stand'st and Armies tremble at thy Sight  As at  Achilles  self Beneath thy Dart  Lies slain the great  Achilles'  dearer Part  Thou from the mighty Dead those Arms hast torn  Which once the greatest of Mankind had worn  Yet live I give thee one illustrious Day  A Blaze of Glory e'er thou fad'st away  For ah no more  Andromache  shall come  With joyful Tears to welcome  Hector  home  No more officious with endearing Charms  From thy tir'd Limbs unbrace  Pelides'  Arms  Then with his sable Brow he gave the Nod  That seals his Word the Sanction of the God  The stubborn Arms by  Jove  's Command dispos'd  Conform'd spontaneous and around him clos'd  Fill'd with the God enlarg'd his Members grew  Thro' all his Veins a sudden Vigour flew  The Blood in brisker Tides began to roll  And  Mars  himself came rushing on his Soul  Exhorting loud thro' all the Field he strode  And look'd and mov'd  Achilles  or a God  Now  Mesthles Glaucus Medon  he inspires  Now  Phorcys Chromius  and  Hippothous  fires  The great  Thersilochus  like Fury found  Asteropaeus  kindled at the Sound  And  Ennomus  in Augury renown'd  Hear all ye Hosts and hear unnumber'd Bands  Of neighb'ring Nations or of distant Lands  'Twas not for State we summon'd you so far  To boast our Numbers and the Pomp of War  Ye came to fight a valiant Foe to chase  To save our present and our future Race  For this our Wealth our Products you enjoy  And glean the Relicks of exhausted  Troy  Now then to conquer or to die prepare  To die or conquer are the Terms of War  Whatever Hand shall win  Patroclus  slain  Whoe'er shall drag him to the  Trojan  Train  With  Hector  's self shall equal Honours claim  With  Hector  part the Spoil and share the Fame  Fir'd by his Words the Troops dismiss their Fears  They join they thicken they protend their Spears  Full on the  Greeks  they drive in firm Array  And each from  Ajax  hopes the glorious Prey  Vain hope what Numbers shall the Field o'erspread  What Victims perish round the mighty Dead  Great  Ajax  mark'd the growing Storm from far  And thus bespoke his Brother of the War  Our fatal Day alas is come my Friend  And all our Wars and Glories at an end  'Tis not this Corpse alone we guard in vain  Condemn'd to Vulturs on the  Trojan  Plain  We too must yield The same sad Fate must fall  On thee on me perhaps my Friend on all  See what a Tempest direful  Hector  spreads  And lo it bursts it thunders on our Heads  Call on our  Greeks  if any hear the Call  The bravest  Greeks  This Hour demands them all  The Warrior rais'd his Voice and wide around  The Field reecho'd the distressful Sound  Oh Chiefs oh Princes to whose Hand is giv'n  The Rule of Men whose Glory is from Heav'n  Whom with due Honours both  Atrides  grace  Ye Guides and Guardians of our  Argive  Race  All whom this wellknown Voice shall reach from far  All whom I see not thro' this Cloud of War  Come all Let gen'rous Rage your Arms employ  And save  Patroclus  from the Dogs of  Troy  Oilean Ajax  first the Voice obey'd  Swift was his Pace and ready was his Aid  Next him  Idomeneus  more slow with Age  And  Merion  burning with a Hero's Rage  The longsucceeding Numbers who can name  But all were  Greeks  and eager all for Fame  Fierce to the Charge great  Hector  led the Throng  Whole  Troy  embodied rush'd with Shouts along  Thus when a MountainBillow foams and raves  Where some swoln River disembogues his Waves  Full in the Mouth is stopp'd the rushing Tide  The boiling Ocean works from Side to Side  The River trembles to his utmost Shore  And distant Rocks rebellow to the Roar  Nor less resolv'd the firm  Achaian  Band  With brazen Shields in horrid Circle stand  Jove  pouring Darkness o'er the mingled Fight  Conceals the Warriors' shining Helms in Night  To him the Chief for whom the Hosts contend  Had liv'd not hateful for he liv'd a Friend  Dead he protects him with superior Care  Nor dooms his Carcase to the Birds of Air  The first Attack the  Grecians  scarce sustain  Repuls'd they yield the  Trojans  seize the slain  Then fierce they rally to Revenge led on  By the swift Rage of  Ajax Telamon    Ajax  to  Peleus'  Son the second Name  In graceful Stature next and next in Fame  With headlong Force the foremost Ranks he tore  So thro' the Thicket bursts the Moutain Boar  And rudely scatters far to distance round  The frighted Hunter and the baying Hound  The Son of  Lethus  brave  Pelasgus'  Heir  Hippothous  dragg'd the Carcase thro' the War  The sinewy Ancles bor'd the Feet he bound  With Thongs inserted thro' the double Wound  Inevitable Fate o'ertakes the Deed  Doom'd by great  Ajax'  vengeful Lance to bleed  It cleft the Helmets brazen Cheeks in twain  The shatter'd Crest and Horsehair strow the Plain  With Nerves relax'd he tumbles to the Ground  The Brain comes gushing from the ghastly Wound  He drops  Patroclus'  Foot and o'er him spread  Now lies a sad Companion of the Dead  Far from  Larissa  lies his native Air  And ill requites his Parent's tender Care  Lamented Youth in Life's first Bloom he fell  Sent by great  Ajax  to the Shades of Hell  Once more at  Ajax Hector  's Jav'lin flies  The  Grecian  marking as it cut the Skies  Shun'd the descending Death which hissing on  Stretch'd in the Dust the great  Iphytus'  Son  Schedius  the brave of all the  Phocian  Kind  The boldest Warrior and the noblest Mind  In little  Panope  for Strength renown'd  He held his Seat and rul'd the Realms around  Plung'd in his Throat the Weapon drank his Blood  And deep transpiercing thro' the Shoulder stood  In clanging Arms the Hero fell and all  The Fields resounded with his weighty Fall  Phorcys  as slain  Hippothous  he defends  The  Telamonian  Lance his Belly rends  The hollow Armour burst before the Stroke  And thro' the Wound the rushing Entrails broke  In strong Convulsions panting on the Sands  He lies and grasps the Dust with dying Hands  Struck at the Sight recede the  Trojan  Train  The shouting  Argives  strip the Heroes slain  And now had  Troy  by  Greece  compell'd to yield  Fled to her Ramparts and resign'd the Field  Greece  in her native Fortitude elate  With  Jove  averse had turn'd the Scale of Fate  But  Phoebus  urg'd  Aeneas  to the Fight  He seem'd like aged  Periphas  to Sight  A Herald in  Anchises'  Love grown old  Rever'd for Prudence and with Prudence bold  Thus Hewhat Methods yet oh Chief remain  To save your  Troy  tho' Heav'n its Fall ordain  There have been Heroes who by virtuous Care  By Valour Numbers and by Arts of War  Have forc'd the Pow'rs to spare a sinking State  And gain'd at length the glorious Odds of Fate  But you when Fortune smiles when  Jove  declares  His partial Favour and assists your Wars  Your shameful Efforts 'gainst your selves employ  And force th'unwilling God to ruin  Troy  Aeneas  thro the Form assum'd descries  The Pow'r conceal'd and thus to  Hector  cries  Oh lasting Shame to our own Fears a Prey  We seek our Ramparts and desert the Day  A God nor is he less my Bosom warms  And tells me  Jove  asserts the  Trojan  Arms  He spoke and foremost to the Combat flew  The bold Example all his Hosts pursue  Then first  Leocritus  beneath him bled  In vain belov'd by valiant  Lycomede  Who veiw'd his Fall and grieving at the Chance  Swift to revenge it sent his angry Lance  The whirling Lance with vig'rous Force addrest  Descends and pants in  Apisaon  's Breast  From rich  Paeonias'  Vales the Warrior came  Next thee  Asteropeus  in Place and Fame  Asteropeus  with Grief beheld the Slain  And rush'd to combate but he rush'd in vain  Indissolubly firm around the Dead  Rank within Rank on Buckler Buckler spread  And hemm'd with bristled Spears the  Grecians  stood  A brazen Bulwark and an iron Wood  Great  Ajax  eyes them with incessant Care  And in an Orb contracts the crowded War  Close in their Ranks commands to fight or fall  And stands the Center and the Soul of all  Fixt on the Spot they war and wounded wound  A sanguine Torrent steeps the reeking Ground  On Heaps the  Greeks  on Heaps the  Trojans  bled  And thick'ning round 'em rise the Hills of Dead  Greece  in close Order and collected Might  Yet suffers least and sways the wav'ring Fight  Fierce as conflicting Fires the Combate burns  And now it rises now it sinks by turns  In one thick Darkness all the Fight was lost  The Sun the Moon and all th' Etherial Host  Seem'd as extinct Day ravish'd from their Eyes  And all Heav'n's Splendors blotted from the Skies  Such o'er  Patroclus  Body hung the Night  The rest in Sunshine fought and open Light  Unclouded there th' Aerial Azure spread  No Vapour rested on the Mountain's Head  The golden Sun pour'd forth a stronger Ray  And all the broad Expansion flam'd with Day  Dispers'd around the Plain by fits they fight  And here and there their scatter'd Arrows light  But Death and Darkness o'er the Carcase spread  There burn'd the War and there the Mighty bled  Meanwhile the Sons of  Nestor  in the Rear  Their Fellows routed toss the distant Spear  And skirmish wide So  Nestor  gave Command  When from the Ships he sent the  Pylian  Band  The youthful Brothers thus for Fame contend  Nor knew the Fortune of  Achilles'  Friend  In thought they view'd him still with martial Joy  Glorious in Arms and dealing Deaths to  Troy  But round the Corps the Heroes pant for Breath  And thick and heavy grows the Work of Death  O'erlabour'd now with Dust and Sweat and Gore  Their Knees their Legs their Feet are cover'd o'er  Drops follow Drops the Clouds on Clouds arise  And Carnage clogs their Hands and Darkness fills their Eyes  As when a slaughter'd Bull's yet reeking Hyde  Strain'd with full Force and tugg'd from Side to Side  The brawny Curriers stretch and labour o'er  Th' extended Surface drunk with Fat and Gore  So tugging round the Corps both Armies stood  The mangled Body bath'd in Sweat and Blood  While  Greeks  and  Ilians  equal Strength employ  Now to the Ships to force it now to  Troy  Not  Pallas'  self her Breast when Fury warms  Nor He whose Anger sets the World in Arms  Could blame this Scene such Rage such Horror reign'd  Such  Jove  to honour the great Dead ordain'd  Achilles  in his Ships at distance lay  Nor knew the fatal Fortune of the Day  He yet unconscious of  Patroclus'  Fall  In dust extended under  Ilion  's Wall  Expects him glorious from the conquer'd Plain  And for his wish'd Return prepares in vain  Tho' well he knew to make proud  Ilion  bend  Was more than Heav'n had destin'd to his Friend  Perhaps to Him This  Thetis  had reveal'd  The rest in pity to her Son conceal'd  Still rag'd the Conflict round the Hero dead  And Heaps on Heaps by mutual Wounds they bled  Curs'd be the Man ev'n private  Greeks  would say  Who dares desert this welldisputed Day  First may the cleaving Earth before our Eyes  Gape wide and drink our Blood for Sacrifice  First perish all e'er haughty  Troy  shall boast  We lost  Patroclus  and our Glory lost  Thus they While with one Voice the  Trojans  said  Grant this Day  Jove  or heap us on the Dead  Then clash their sounding Arms the Clangors rise  And shake the brazen Concave of the Skies  Meantime at distance from the Scene of Blood  The pensive Steeds of great  Achilles  stood  Their godlike Master slain before their Eyes  They wept and shar'd in human Miseries  In vain  Automedon  now shakes the Rein  Now plies the Lash and sooths and threats in vain  Nor to the Fight nor  Hellespont  they go  Restive they stood and obstinate in Woe  Still as a Tombstone never to be mov'd  On some good Man or Woman unreprov'd  Lays its eternal Weight or fix'd as stands  A marble Courser by the Sculptor's Hands  Plac'd on the Hero's Grave Along their Face  The big round Drops cours'd down with silent pace  Conglobing on the Dust Their Manes that late  Circled their arching Necks and wav'd in State  Trail'd on the Dust beneath the Yoke were spread  And prone to Earth was hung their languid Head  Nor  Jove  disdain'd to cast a pitying Look  While thus relenting to the Steeds he spoke  Unhappy Coursers of immortal Strain  Exempt from Age and deathless now in vain  Did we your Race on mortal Man bestow  Only alas to share in mortal Woe  For ah what is there of inferior Birth  That breathes or creeps upon the Dust of Earth  What wretched Creature of what wretched kind  Than Man more weak calamitous and blind  A miserable Race But cease to mourn  For not by you shall  Priam  's Son be born  High on the splendid Car One glorious Prize  He rashly boasts the rest our Will denies  Ourself will Swiftness to your Nerves impart  Ourself with rising Spirits swell your Heart  Automedon  your rapid Flight shall bear  Safe to the Navy thro' the Storm of War  For yet 'tis giv'n to  Troy  to ravage o'er  The Field and spread her Slaughters to the Shore  The Sun shall see her conquer till his Fall  With sacred Darkness shades the Face of all  He said and breathing in th'immortal Horse  Excessive Spirit urg'd 'em to the Course  From their high Manes they shake the Dust and bear  The kindling Chariot thro' the parted War  So flies a Vulture thro' the clam'rous Train  Of Geese that scream and scatter round the Plain  From Danger now with swiftest Speed they flew  And now to Conquest with like Speed pursue  Sole in the Seat the Charioteer remains  Now plies the Jav'lin now directs the Reins  Him brave  Alcimedon  beheld distrest  Approach'd the Chariot and the Chief addrest  What God provokes thee rashly thus to dare  Alone unaided in the thickest War  Alas thy Friend is slain and  Hector  wields  Achilles'  Arms triumphant in the Fields  In happy time the Charioteer replies  The bold  Alcimedon  now greets my Eyes  No  Greek  like him the heav'nly Steeds restrains  Or holds their Fury in suspended Reins  Patroclus  while he liv'd their Rage cou'd tame  But now  Patroclus  is an empty Name  To thee I yield the Seat to thee resign  The ruling Charge The Task of Fight be mine  He said  Alcimedon  with active Heat  Snatches the Reins and vaults into the Seat  His Friend descends The Chief of  Troy  descry'd  And call'd  Aeneas  fighting near his Side  Lo to my Sight beyond our Hope restor'd  Achilles'  Car deserted of its Lord  The glorious Steeds our ready Arms invite  Scarce their weak Drivers guide them thro' the Fight  Can such Opponents stand when we assail  Unite thy Force my Friend and we prevail  The Son of  Venus  to the Counsel yields  Then o'er their Backs they spread their solid Shields  With Brass refulgent the broad Surface shin'd  And thick Bullhides the Spacious Concave lin'd  Them  Chromius  follows  Aretus  succeeds  Each hopes the Conquest of the lofty Steeds  In vain brave Youths with glorious Hopes ye burn  In vain advance not fated to return  Unmov'd  Automedon  attends the Fight  Implores th' Eternal and collects his Might  Then turning to his Friend with dauntless Mind  Oh keep the foaming Coursers close behind  Full on my Shoulders let their Nostrils blow  For hard the Fight determin'd is the Foe  'Tis  Hector  comes and when he seeks the Prize  War knows no mean he wins it or he dies  Then thro' the Field he sends his Voice aloud  And calls th'  Ajaces  from the warring Croud  With great  Atrides  Hither turn he said  Turn where Distress demands immediate Aid  The Dead incircled by his Friends forego  And save the Living from a fiercer Foe  Unhelp'd we stand unequal to engage  The Force of  Hector  and  Aeneas'  Rage  Yet mighty as they are my Force to prove  Is only mine th' Event belongs to  Jove  He spoke and high the sounding Jav'lin flung  Which pass'd the Shield of  Aretus  the young  It pierc'd his Belt emboss'd with curious Art  Then in the lower Belly stuck the Dart  As when the pond'rous Axe descending full  Cleaves the broad Forehead of some brawny Bull  Struck 'twixt the Horns he springs with many a Bound  Then tumbling rolls enormous on the Ground  Thus fell the Youth the Air his Soul receiv'd  And the Spear trembled as his Entrails heav'd  Now at  Automedon  the  Trojan  Foe  Discharg'd his Lance the meditated Blow  Stooping he shun'd the Jav'lin idly fled  And hiss'd innoxious o'er the Hero's Head  Deep rooted in the Ground the forceful Spear  In long Vibrations spent its Fury there  With clashing Falchions now the Chiefs had clos'd  But each brave  Ajax  heard and interpos'd  Nor longer  Hector  with his  Trojans  stood  But left their slain Companion in his Blood  His Arms  Automedon  divests and cries  Accept  Patroclus  this mean Sacrifice  Thus have I sooth'd my Griefs and thus have paid  Poor as it is some Off'ring to thy Shade  So looks the Lion o'er a mangled Boar  All grim with Rage and horrible with Gore  High on the Chariot at one Bound he sprung  And o'er his Seat the bloody Trophies hung  And now  Minerva  from the Realms of Air  Descends impetuous and renews the War  For pleas'd at length the  Grecian  Arms to aid  The Lord of Thunders sent the blueey'd Maid  As when high  Jove  denouncing future Woe  O'er the dark Clouds extends his Purple Bow  In sign of Tempests from the troubled Air  Or from the Rage of Man destructive War  The drooping Cattel dread th'impending Skies  And from his halftill'd Field the Lab'rer flies  In such a Form the Goddess round her drew  A livid Cloud and to the Battle flew  Assuming  Phoenix'  Shape on Earth she falls  And in his wellknown Voice to  Sparta  calls  And lies  Achilles'  Friend belov'd by all  A Prey to Dogs beneath the  Trojan  Wall  What Shame to  Greece  for future times to tell  To thee the greatest in whose Cause he fell  O Chief Oh Father  Atreus'  Son replies  O full of Days by long Experience wise  What more desires my Soul than here unmov'd  To guard the Body of the Man I lov'd  Ah would  Minerva  send me Strength to rear  This weary'd Arm and ward the Storm of War  But  Hector  like the Rage of Fire we dread  And  Jove  's own Glories blaze around his Head  Pleas'd to be first of all the Pow'rs addrest  She breathes new Vigour in her Hero's Breast  And fills with keen Revenge with fell Despight  Desire of Blood and Rage and Lust of Fight  So burns the vengeful Hornet Soul all o'er  Repuls'd in vain and thirsty still of Gore  Bold Son of Air and Heat on angry Wings  Untam'd untir'd he turns attacks and stings  Fir'd with like Ardour fierce  Atrides  flew  And sent his Soul with ev'ry Lance he threw  There stood a  Trojan  not unknown to Fame  Eëtion  's Son and  Podes  was his Name  With Riches honour'd and with Courage blest  By  Hector  lov'd his Comrade and his Guest  Thro' his broad Belt the Spear a Passage found  And pond'rous as he falls his Arms resound  Sudden at  Hector  's Side  Apollo  stood  Like  Phaenops Asius'  Son appear'd the God    Asius  the Great who held his wealthy Reign  In fair  Abydos  by the rolling Main  Oh Prince he cry'd oh foremost once in Fame  What  Grecian  now shall tremble at thy Name  Dost thou at length to  Menelaus  yield  A Chief once thought no Terror of the Field  Yet singly now the long disputed Prize  He bears victorious while our Army flies  By the same Arm illustrious  Podes  bled  The Friend of  Hector  unreveng'd is dead  This heard o'er  Hector  spreads a Cloud of Woe  Rage lifts his Lance and drives him on the Foe  But now th'Eternal shook his sable Shield  That shaded  Ide  and all the subject Field  Beneath its ample Verge A rolling Cloud  Involv'd the Mount the Thunder roar'd aloud  Th'affrighted Hills from their Foundations nod  And blaze beneath the Lightnings of the God  At one Regard of his allseeing Eye  The Vanquish'd triumph and the Victors fly  Then trembled  Greece  The Flight  Peneleus  led  For as the brave  Boeotian  turn'd his Head  To face the Foe  Polydamas  drew near  And raz'd his Shoulder with a shorten'd Spear  By  Hector  wounded  Leitus  quits the Plain  Pierc'd thro' the Wrist and raging with the Pain  Grasps his once formidable Lance in vain  As  Hector  follow'd  Idomen  addrest  The flaming Jav'lin to his manly Breast  The brittle Point before his Corselet yields  Exulting  Troy  with Clamour fills the Fields  High on his Chariot as the  Cretan  stood  The Son of  Priam  whirl'd the missive Wood  But erring from its Aim th'impetuous Spear  Strook to the Dust the Squire and Charioteer  Of martial  Merion Coeranus  his Name  Who left fair  Lyctus  for the Fields of Fame  On foot bold  Merion  fought and now laid low  Had grac'd the Triumphs of his  Trojan  Foe  But the brave Squire the ready Coursers brought  And with his Life his Master's Safety bought  Between his Cheek and Ear the Weapon went  The Teeth it shatter'd and the Tongue it rent  Prone from the Seat he tumbles to the Plain  His dying Hand forgets the falling Rein  This  Merion  reaches bending from the Car  And urges to desert the hopeless War  Idomeneus  consents the Lash applies  And the swift Chariot to the Navy flies  Nor  Ajax  less the Will of Heav'n descry'd  And Conquest shifting to the  Trojan  Side  Turn'd by the Hand of  Jove  Then thus begun  To  Atreus'  Seed the godlike  Telamon  Alas who sees not  Jove  's almighty Hand  Transfers the Glory to the  Trojan  Band  Whether the Weak or Strong discharge the Dart  He guides each Arrow to a  Grecian  Heart  Not so our Spears incessant tho' they rain  He suffers ev'ry Lance to fall in vain  Deserted of the God yet let us try  What human Strength and Prudence can supply  If yet this honour'd Corps in Triumph born  May glad the Fleets that hope not our return  Who tremble yet scarce rescu'd from their Fates  And still hear  Hector  thund'ring at their Gates  Some Hero too must be dispatch'd to bear  The mournful Message to  Pelides'  Ear  For sure he knows not distant on the Shore  His Friend his lov'd  Patroclus  is no more  But such a Chief I spy not thro' the Host  The Men the Steeds the Armies all are lost  In gen'ral DarknessLord of Earth and Air  Oh King oh Father hear my humble Pray'r  Dispel this Cloud the Light of Heav'n restore  Give me to see and  Ajax  asks no more  If  Greece  must perish we thy Will obey  But let us perish in the Face of Day  With Tears the Hero spoke and at his Pray'r  The God relenting clear'd the clouded Air  Forth burst the Sun with allenlight'ning Ray  The Blaze of Armour flash'd against the Day  Now now  Atrides  cast around thy Sight  If yet  Antilochus  survives the Fight  Let him to great  Achilles'  Ear convey  The fatal News  Atrides  hasts away  So turns the Lion from the nightly Fold  Tho high in Courage and with Hunger bold  Long gall'd by Herdsmen and long vext by Hounds  Stiff with Fatigue and fretted sore with Wounds  The Darts fly round him from a hundred Hands  And the red Terrors of the blazing Brands  Till late reluctant at the Dawn of Day  Sow'r he departs and quits th'untasted Prey  So mov'd  Atrides  from his dang'rous Place  With weary'd Limbs but with unwilling Pace  The Foe he fear'd might yet  Patroclus  gain  And much admonish'd much adjur'd his Train  Oh guard these Relicks to your Charge consign'd  And bear the Merits of the Dead in Mind  How skill'd he was in each obliging Art  The mildest Manners and the gentlest Heart  He was alas But Fate decreed his End  In Death a Hero as in Life a Friend  So parts the Chief from Rank to Rank he flew  And round on all sides sent his piercing View  As the bold Bird endu'd with sharpest Eye  Of all that wing the mid Aerial Sky  The sacred Eagle from his Walks above  Looks down and sees the distant Thicket move  Then stoops and sowsing on the quiv'ring Hare  Snatches his Life amid the Clouds of Air  Not with less Quickness his exerted Sight  Pass'd this and that way thro' the Ranks of Fight  Till on the Left the Chief he sought he found  Chearing his Men and spreading Deaths around  To him the King Belov'd of  Jove  draw near  For sadder Tydings never touch'd thy Ear  Thy Eyes have witness'd what a fatal Turn  How  Ilion  triumphs and th'  Achaians  mourn  This is not all  Patroclus  on the Shore  Now pale and dead shall succour  Greece  no more  Fly to the Fleet this Instant fly and tell  The sad  Achilles  how his lov'd one fell  He too may haste the naked Corps to gain  The Arms are  Hector  's who despoil'd the Slain  The youthful Warrior heard with silent Woe  From his fair Eyes the Tears began to flow  Big with the mighty Grief he strove to say  What Sorrow dictates but no Word found way  To brave  Laodocus  his Arms he flung  Who near him wheeling drove his Steeds along  Then ran the mournful Message to impart  With Tearful Eyes and with dejected Heart  Swift fled the Youth nor  Menelaus  stands  Tho' sore distrest to aid the  Pylian  Bands  But bids bold  Thrasymede  those Troops sustain  Himself returns to his  Patroclus  slain  Gone is  Antilochus  the Hero said  But hope not Warriors for  Achilles'  Aid  Tho' fierce his Rage unbounded be his Woe  Unarm'd he fights not with the  Trojan  Foe  'Tis in our Hands alone our Hopes remain  'Tis our own Vigour must the Dead regain  And save our selves while with impetuous Hate  Troy  pours along and this way rolls our Fate  'Tis well said  Ajax  be it then thy Care  With  Merion  's Aid the weighty Corse to rear  My self and my bold Brother will sustain  The Shock of  Hector  and his charging Train  Nor fear we Armies fighting Side by Side  What  Troy  can dare we have already try'd  Have try'd it and have stood The Hero said  High from the Ground the Warriors heave the Dead  A gen'ral Clamour rises at the Sight  Loud shout the  Trojans  and renew the Fight  Not fiercer rush along the gloomy Wood  With Rage insatiate and with Thirst of Blood  Voracious Hounds that many a Length before  Their furious Hunters drive the wounded Boar  But if the Savage turns his glaring Eye  They howl aloof and round the Forest fly  Thus on retreating  Greece  the  Trojans  pour  Wave their thick Falchions and their Jav'lins show'r  But  Ajax  turning to their Fears they yield  All pale they tremble and forsake the Field  While thus aloft the Hero's Corse they bear  Behind them rages all the Storm of War  Confusion Tumult Horror o'er the Throng  Of Men Steeds Chariots urg'd the Rout along  Less fierce the Winds with rising Flames conspire  To whelm some City under Waves of Fire  Now sink in gloomy Clouds the proud Abodes  Now crack the blazing Temples of the Gods  The rumbling Torrent thro' the Ruin rolls  And Sheets of Smoak mount heavy to the Poles  The Heroes sweat beneath their honour'd Load  As when two Mules along the rugged Road  From the steep Mountain with exerted Strength  Drag some vast Beam or Mast's unwieldy Length  Inly they groan big Drops of Sweat distill  Th'enormous Timber lumbring down the Hill  So theseBehind the Bulk of  Ajax  stands  And breaks the Torrent of the rushing Bands  Thus when a River swell'd with sudden Rains  Spreads his broad Waters o'er the level Plains  Some interposing Hill the Stream divides  And breaks its Force and turns the winding Tides  Still close they follow close the Rear engage  Aeneas  storms and  Hector  foams with Rage  While  Greece  a heavy thick Retreat maintains  Wedg'd in one Body like a Flight of Cranes  That shriek incessant while the Faulcon hung  High on pois'd Pinions threats their callow Young  So from the  Trojan  Chiefs the  Grecians  fly  Such the wild Terror and the mingled Cry  Within without the Trench and all the way  Strow'd in bright Heaps their Arms and Armour lay  Such Horror  Jove  imprest Yet still proceeds  The Work of Death and still the Battel bleeds  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Seventeenth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK  I  THIS is the only Book of the Iliad which is a continued Description of a Battel without any Digression or Episode that serves for an Interval to refresh the Reader The heav'nly Machines too are fewer than in any other  Homer  seems to have trusted wholly to the Force of his own Genius as sufficient to support him whatsoever lengths he was carried by it But that Spirit which animates the Original is what I am sensible evaporates so much in my Hands that tho' I can't think my Author tedious I should have made him seem so if I had not translated this Book with all possible Conciseness I hope there is nothing material omitted tho' the Version consists but of sixty five Lines more than the Original  However one may observe there are more Turns of Fortune more Defeats more Rallyings more Accidents in this Battel than in any other because it was to be the last wherein the  Greeks  and  Trojans  were upon equal Terms before the Return of  Achilles  And besides all this serves to introduce the chief Hero with the greater Pomp and Dignity  II  VERSE  Great Menelaus    The Poet here takes occasion to clear  Menelaus  from the Imputations of Idle and Effeminate cast on him in some Parts of the Poem he sets him in the Front of the Army exposing himself to Dangers in defending the Body of  Patroclus  and gives him the Conquest of  Euphorbus  who had the first Hand in his Death He is represented as the foremost who appears in his Defence not only as one of a like Disposition of Mind with  Patroclus  a kind and generous Friend but as being more immediately concern'd in Honour to protect from Injuries the Body of a Hero that fell in his Cause  Eustathius  See the  th  Note on the  d  Book  III  VERSE  Thus round her new fal'n Young  c  In this Comparison as  Eustathius  has very well observed the Poet accomodating himself to the Occasion means only to describe the Affection  Menelaus  had for  Patroclus  and the Manner in which he presented himself to defend his Body And this Comparison is so much the more just and agreeable as  Menelaus  was a Prince full of Goodness and Mildness He must have little Sense or Knowledge in Poetry who thinks that it ought to be suppress'd It is true we shou'd not ues it nowadays by reason of the low Ideas we have of the Animals from which it is derived but those not being the Ideas of  Homer  's Time they could not hinder him from making a proper Use of such a Comparison  Dacier  IV  VERSE  id Thus round her new fal'n Young  c  It seems to me remarkable that the several Comparisons to illustrate the Concern for  Patroclus  are taken from the most tender  Sentiments of Nature  Achilles  in the Beginning of the  th  Book considers him as a Child and himself as his Mother The Sorrow of  Menelaus  is here described as that of a Heifer for her young one Perhaps these are design'd to intimate the excellent Temper and Goodness of  Patroclus  which is express'd in that fine Elogy of him in this Book ℣    He knew how to be goodnatur'd to all Men  This gave all Mankind these Sentiments for him and no doubt the same is strongly pointed at by the uncommon Concern of the whole Army to rescue his Body  The Dissimilitude of Manners between these two Friends  Achilles  and  Patroclus  is very observable Such Friendships are not uncommon and I have often assign'd this Reason for them that it is natural for Men to seek the Assistance of those Qualities in others which they want themselves That is still better if apply'd to Providence that associates Men of different and contrary Qualities in order to make a more perfect System But whatever is customary in Nature  Homer  had a good poetical Reason for it for it affords many Incidents to illustrate the Manners of them both more strongly and is what they call a Contrast in Painting  V  VERSE  The Son of Panthus    The Conduct of  Homer  is admirable in bringing  Euphorbus  and  Menelaus  together upon this Occasion for hardly any thing but such a signal Revenge for the Death of his Brother could have made  Euphorbus  stand the Encounter  Menelaus  putting him in mind of the Death of his Brother gives occasion I think to one of the finest Answers in all  Homer  in which the Insolence of  Menelaus  is retorted in a way to draw Pity from every Reader and I believe there is hardly one after such a Speech that would not wish  Euphorbus  had the better of  Menelaus  A Writer of Romances would not have fail'd to have giv'n  Euphorbus  the Victory But however it was fitter to make  Menelaus  who had receiv'd the greatest Injury do the most revengeful Actions  VI  VERSE  Instarr'd with Gems and Gold    We have here a  Trojan  who uses Gold and Silver to adorn his Hair which made  Pliny  say that he doubted whether the Women were the first that us'd those Ornaments  Est quidem apud eundem  Homerum  virorum crinibus aurum implexum ideo nescio an prior usus à foeminis coeperit  Lib Chap He might likewise have strengthen'd his Doubt by the Custom of the  Athenians  who put into their Hair little Grashoppers of Gold  Dacier  VII  VERSE  As the young Olive  c  This exquisite Simile finely illustrates the Beauty and sudden Fall of  Euphorbus  in which the Allusion to that Circumstance of his comely Hair is peculiarly happy  Porphyry  and  Jamblicus  acquaints us of the particular Affection  Pythagoras  had for these Verses which he set to the Harp and us'd to repeat at his own  Epicedion  Perhaps it was his Fondness of them which put it into his Head to say that his Soul transmigrated to him from this Hero However it was this Conceit of  Pythagoras  is famous in Antiquity and has given occasion to a Dialogue in  Lucian  entitled  The Cock  which is I think the finest Piece of that Author  VIII  VERSE  Thus young thus beautiful  Euphorbus  lay    This is the only  Trojan  whose Death the Poet laments that he might do the more Honour to  Patroclus  his Hero's Friend The Comparison here us'd is very proper for the Olive always preserves its Beauty But where the Poet speaks of the  Lapithae  a hardy and warlike People he compares them to  Oaks  that stand unmov'd in Storms and Tempests and where  Hector  falls by  Ajax  he likens him to an  Oak  struck  down by  Jove  's Thunder Just after this soft Comparison upon the Beauty of  Euphorbus  he passes to another full of Strength and Terror that of the Lion  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  Did but the Voice of  Ajax  reach my Ear    How observable is  Homer  's Art of illustrating the Valour and Glory of his Heroes  Menelaus  who sees  Hector  and all the  Trojans  rushing upon him wou'd not retire if  Apollo  did not support them and though  Apollo  does support them he wou'd oppose even  Apollo  were  Ajax  but near him This is glorious for  Menelaus  and yet more glorious for  Ajax  and very suitable to his Character for  Ajax  was the bravest of the  Greeks  next to  Achilles Dacier Eustathius  X  VERSE  So from the Fold th'unwilling Lion    The Beauty of the Retreat of  Menelaus  is worthy Notice  Homer  is a great Observer of natural Imagery that brings the Thing represented before our View It is indeed true that Lions Tygers and Beasts of Prey are the only Objects that can properly represent Warriors and therefore 'tis no wonder they are so often introduc'd The inanimate Things as Floods Fires and Storms are the best and only Images of Battels  XI  VERSE  Already had stern  Hector  c    Homer  takes care so long beforehand to lessen in his Reader's Mind the Horror he may conceive from the Cruelty that  Achilles  will exercise upon the Body of  Hector  That Cruelty will be only the Punishment of this which  Hector  here exercises upon the Body of  Patroclus  he drags him he designs to cut off his Head and to leave his Body upon the Ramparts expos'd to Dogs and Birds of Prey  Eustathius  XII  VERSE  You left him there a Prey to Dogs    It was highly dishonourable in  Hector  to forsake the Body of a Friend and Guest and against the Laws of  Jupiter Xenius  or  hospitalis  For  Glaucus  knew nothing of  Sarpedon  's being honour'd with Burial by the Gods and sent embalm'd into  Lycia Eustathius  XIII  VERSE  I shun great Ajax    Hector  takes no notice of the Affronts that  Glaucus  had thrown upon him as knowing he had in some Respects a just Cause to be angry but he cannot put up what he had said of his fearing  Ajax  to which Part he only replies This is very agreeable to his heroic Character  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE  Hector in proud Achilles Arms shall shine    The Ancients have observed that  Homer  causes the Arms of  Achilles  to fall into  Hector  's Power to equal in some sort those two Heroes in the Battel wherein he is going to engage them Otherwise it might be urg'd that  Achilles  cou'd not have kill'd  Hector  without the Advantage of having his Armous made by the Hand of a God whereas  Hector  's was only of the Hand of a Mortal but since both were clad in Armour made by  Vulcan Achilles  's Victory will be compleat and in its full Lustre Besides this Reason which is for Necessity and Probability there is also another for Ornament for  Homer  here prepares to introduce that beautiful Episode of the divine Armour which  Vulcan  makes for  Achilles Eustathius  XV  VERSE  The radiant Arms to sacred Ilion bore    A Difficulty may arise here and the Question may be asked why  Hector  sent these Arms to  Troy  Why did not he take them at first There are three Answers which I think are all plausible The first that  Hector  having kill'd  Patroclus  and seeing the Day very far advanced had no mind to take those Arms for a Fight almost at an end The second that he was impatient to shew to  Priam  and  Andromache  those glorious Spoils Thirdly he perhaps at first intended to hang them up in some Temple  Glaucus  's Speech makes him change his Resolution he runs after those Arms to fight against  Ajax  and to win  Patroclus  's Body from him  Dacier  Homer  says  Eustathius  does not suffer the Arms to be carry'd into  Troy  for these Reasons That  Hector  by wearing them might the more encourage the  Trojans  and be the more formidable to the  Greeks  That  Achilles  may recover them again when he kills  Hector  And that he may conquer him even when he is strengthened with that divine Armour  XVI  VERSE Jupiter  's Speech to  Hector  The Poet prepares us for the Death of  Hector  perhaps to please the  Greek  Readers who might be troubled to see him shining in their Heroes Arms Therefore  Jupiter  expresses his Sorrow at the approaching Fate of this unfortunate Prince promises to repay his Loss of Life with Glory and nods to give a certain Confirmation to his Words He says  Achilles  is the bravest  Greek  as  Glaucus  had said just before the Poet thus giving him the greatest Commendations by putting his Praise in the Mouth of a God and of an Enemy who were neither of them like to be prejudiced in his Favour  Eustathius  How beautiful is that Sentiment upon the miserable State of Mankind introduc'd here so artfully and so strongly enforc'd by being put into the Mouth of the supreme Being And how pathetic the Denunciation of  Hector  's Death by that Circumstance of  Andromache  's Disappointment when she shall no more receive her Hero glorious from the Battel in the Armour of his conquer'd Enemy  XVII  VERSE  The stubborn Arms  c  The Words are  If we give  a passive Signification it will be the Arms fitted  Hector  but if an active as those take it who would put a greater Difference between  Hector  and  Achilles  then it belongs to  Jupiter  and the Sense will be  Jupiter  made the Arms fit for him which were too large before I have chosen the last as the more poetical Sense  XVIII  VERSE  Unnumber'd Bands of neighb'ring Nations    Eustathius  has very well explain'd the Artifice of this Speech of  Hector  who indirectly answers all  Glaucus  's Invectives and humbles his Vanity  Glaucus  had just spoken as if the  Lycians  were the only Allies of  Troy  and  Hector  here speaks of the numerous Troops of different Nations which he expresly designs by calling them Borderers upon his Kingdom thereby in some manner to exclude the  Lycians  who were of a Country more remote as if he did not vouchsafe to reckon them He afterwards confutes what  Glaucus  said  "that if the  Lycians  wou'd take his Advice they wou'd return home"  for he gives them to understand that being hired Troops they are obliged to perform their Bargain and to fight till the War is at an end  Dacier  XIX  VERSE  Call on our Greeks    Eustathius  gives three Reasons why  Ajax  bids  Menelaus  call the  Greeks  to their Assistance instead of calling them himself He might be sham'd to do it lest it should look like Fear and turn to  his Dishonour Or the Chiefs were more likely to obey  Menelaus  Or he had too much Business of the War upon his Hands and wanted Leisure more than the other  XX  VERSE Oilean Ajax  first    Ajax Oileus  says  Eustathius  is the first that comes being brought by his Love to the other  Ajax  as it is natural for one Friend to fly to the Assistance of another To which we may add he might very probably come first because he was the swiftest of all the Heroes  XXI  VERSE Jove  pouring Darkness    Homer  who in all his former Descriptions of Battels is so fond of mentioning the Lustre of the Arms here shades them in Darkness perhaps alluding to the Clouds of Dust that were rais'd or to the Throng of Combatants or else to denote the Loss of  Greece  in  Patroclus  or lastly that as the Heav'ns had mourn'd  Sarpedon  in Showers of Blood so they might  Patroclus  in Clouds of Darkness  Eustathius  XXII  VERSE Panope  renown'd    Panope  was a small Town twenty  Stadia  from  Chaeronea  on the side of Mount  Parnassus  and it is hard to know why  Homer  gives it the Epithet of  renown'd  and makes it the Residence of  Schedius  King of the  Phocians  when it was but nine hundred Paces in Circuit and had no Palace nor Gymnasium nor Theatre nor Market nor Fountain nothing in short that ought to have been in a Town which is the Residence of a King  Pausanias  in  Phocic  gives the Reason of it he says that as  Phocis  was exposed on that side to the Inroads of the  Boeotians Schedius  made use of  Panope  as a sort of Citadel or Place of Arms  Dacier  XXIII  VERSE  He seem'd like aged  Periphas  The Speech of  Periphas  to  Aeneas  hints at the double Fate and the Necessity of Means It is much like that of St  Paul  after he was promised that no body should perish he says  except these abide ye cannot be saved  XXIV  VERSE  In one thick Darkness  c  The Darkness spread over the Body of  Patroclus  is artful upon several Accounts First a fine Image of Poetry Next a Token of  Jupiter  's Love to a righteous Man but the chief Design is to portract the Action which if the  Trojans  had seen the Spot must have been decided one way or other in a very short time Besides the  Trojans  having the better in the Action must have seiz'd the Body contrary to the Intention of the Author There are innumerable Instances of these little Niceties and Particularities of Conduct in  Homer  XXV  VERSE  Meanwhile the Sons of Nestor in the Rear  c  It is not without Reason  Homer  in this Place makes particular mention of the Sons of  Nestor  It is to prepare us against he sends one of them to  Achilles  to tell him the Death of his Friend  XXVI  VERSE  As when a slaughter'd Bull's yet reeking Hide    Homer  gives us a most lively Description of their drawing the Body on all sides and instructs us in the ancient manner of stretching Hides being first made soft and supple with Oyl And tho' this Comparison be one of those mean  and humble ones which some have objected to yet it has also its Admirers for being so expressive and for representing to the Imagination the most strong and exact Idea of the Subject in hand  Eustathius  XXVII  VERSE  Not  Pallas  self  c  Homer  says in the Original  "  Minerva  could not have found fault tho' she were angry"  Upon which  Eustathius  ingeniously observes how common and natural it is for Persons in Anger to turn Criticks and find Faults where there are none  XXVIII  VERSE  To make proud  Ilion  bend  Was more than Heav'n had promis'd to his Friend  Perhaps to Him    In these Words the Poet artfully hints at  Achilles  's Death he makes him not absolutely to flatter himself with the Hopes of ever taking  Troy  in his own Person however he does not say this expresly but passes it over as an ungrateful Subject  Eustathius  XXIX  VERSE  The rest in pity to her Son conceal'd    Here says the same Author we have two Rules laid down for common use One not to tell our Friends all their Mischances at once it being often necessary to hide part of them as  Thetis  does from  Achilles  The other not to push Men of Courage upon all that is possible for them to do Thus  Achilles  tho' he thought  Patroclus  able to drive the  Trojans  back to their Gates yet he does not order him to do so much but only to save the Ships and beat them back into the Field  Homer  's admonishing the Reader that  Achilles  's Mother had conceal'd the Circumstance of the Death of his Friend when she instructed him in his Fate and that all he knew was only that  Troy  could not be taken at that time this is a great Instance of his Care of the Probability and of his having the whole Plan of the Poem at once in his Head For upon the Supposition that  Achilles  was instructed in his Fate it was a natural Objection how came he to hazard his Friend If he was ignorant on the other hand of the Impossibility of  Troy  's being taken at that time he might for all he knew be robb'd by his Friend of whose Valour he had so good an Opinion of that Glory which he was unwilling to part with  XXX  VERSE  The pensive Steeds of great  Achilles c  It adds a great Beauty to a Poem when inanimate Things act like animate Thus the Heavens tremble at  Jupiter  's Nod the Sea parts it self to receive  Neptune  the Groves of  Ida  shake beneath  Juno  's Feet  c  As also to find animate or brute Creatures addrest to as if rational So  Hector  encourages his Horses and one of  Achilles  's is endued not only with Speech but with Foreknowledge of future Events Here they weep for  Patroclus  and stand fix'd and unmoveable with Grief Thus is this Hero universally mourn'd and every thing concurs to lament his Loss  Eustathius  As to the particular Fiction of the Horses weeping it is countenanc'd both by Naturalists and Historians  Aristotle  and  Pliny  write that these Animals often deplore their Masters lost in Battel and even shed Tears for them So  Solinus  c  Aelian  relates the like of Elephants when they are carry'd from their native Countrey  De Animal  lib c  Suetonius  in the Life of  Caesar  tells us that several Horses which at the Passage of the  Rubicon  had been consecrated to  Mars  and turn'd loose on the Banks were observed for some Days after to abstain from feeding and to weep abundantly  Proximis diebus equorum greges quos in trajiciendo  Rubicone  flumine Marti consecrârat ac  sine custode vagos dimiserat comperit pabulo pertinacissimè abstinere ubertim{que} flere  Cap  Virgil  could not forbear copying this beautiful Circumstance in those fine Lines on the Horse of  Pallas  Post bellator Equus positis insignibus Aethon  It lacrymans guttis{que} humectat grandibus ora  XXXI  VERSE  At distance from the Scene of Blood    If the Horses had not gone aside out of the War  Homer  could not have introduc'd so well what he design'd to their Honour So he makes them weeping in secret as their Master  Achilles  us'd to do and afterwards coming into the Battel where they are taken notice of and pursued by  Hector Eustathius  XXXII  VERSE  Or fix'd as stands a marble Courser  c  Homer  alludes to the Custom in those Days of placing Columns upon Tombs on which Columns there were frequently Chariots with two or four Horses This furnish'd  Homer  with this beautiful Image as if these Horses meant to remain there to serve for an immortal Monument to  Patroclus Dacier  I believe M  Dacier  refines too much in this Note  Homer  says  and seems to turn the Thought only on the Firmness of the Column and not on the Imag'ry of it Which would give it an Air a little too modern like that of  Shakespear She sate like  Patience  on a Monument Smiling at  GriefBe it as it will this Conjecture is ingenious and the whole Comparison is as beautiful as just The Horses standing still to mourn for their Master could not be more finely represented than by the dumb Sorrow of Images standing over a Tomb Perhaps the very Posture in which these Horses are described their Heads bowed  down and their Manes falling in the Dust has an Allusion to the Attitude in which those Statues on Monuments were usually represented There are  BasReliefs  that favour this Conjecture  XXXIII  VERSE  The Sun shall see  Troy  conquer    It is worth observing with what Art and Oeconomy  Homer  conducts his Fable to bring on the Catastrophe  Achilles  must hear  Patroclus  's Death  Hector  must fall by his Hand This can not happen if the Armies continue fighting about the Body of  Patroclus  under the Walls of  Troy  Therefore to change the Face of Affairs  Jupiter  is going to raise the Courage of the  Trojans  and make them repulse and chase the  Greeks  again as far as their Fleet this obliges  Achilles  to go forth tho' without Arms and thereby every thing comes to an Issue  Dacier  XXXIV  VERSE  Scarce their weak Drivers    There was but one Driver since  Alcimedon  was alone upon the Chariot and  Automedon  was got down to fight But in Poetry as well as in Painting there is often but  one Moment  to be taken hold on  Hector  sees  Alcimedon  mount the Chariot before  Automedon  was descended from it and thereupon judging of their Intention and seeing them both as yet upon the Chariot he calls to  Aeneas  He terms them both  Drivers  in Mockery because he saw them take the Reins one after the other as if he said that Chariot had two Drivers but never a Fighter 'Tis one single  Moment  that makes this Image In reading the Poets one often falls into great Perplexities for want of rightly distinguishing the Point of Time in which they speak  Dacier  The Art of  Homer  in this whole Passage concerning  Automedon  is very remarkable in finding out the only proper Occasion for so renowned a Person as the  Charioteer  of  Achilles  to signalize his Valour  XXXV  VERSE  In vain brave Youths with glorious Hopes ye burn  In vain advance not fated to return    These beautiful Anticipations are frequent in the Poets who affect to speak in the Character of Prophets and Men inspired with the Knowledge of Futurity Thus  Virgil  to  Turnus  Nescia mens hominum fatiTurno tempus erit  c  So  Tasso  Cant when  Argante  had vow'd the Destruction of  Tancred  O vani giuramenti Ecco contrari  Seguir tosto gli effetti a l' alta speme  E cader questi in teneon pari estinto  Sotto colui ch' ei fà già preso e vinto  And  Milton  makes the like Apostrophe to  Eve  at her leaving  Adam  before she met the Serpent  She to him engag'd  To be return'd by Noon amid the Bower  And all Things in best order to invite  Noontide repast or Afternoon's Repose  O much deceiv'd much failing hapless  Eve  Thou never from that Hour in Paradise  Found'st either sweet Repast or sound Repose  XXXVI  VERSE  So burns the vengesul Hornet  c  It is literally in the  Greek she inspir'd the Hero with the Boldness of a Fly  There is no Impropriety in the Comparison this Animal being of all others the most persevering in its Attacks and the most difficult to be beaten off The Occasion also of the Comparison being the resolute Persistance  of  Menelaus  about the dead Body renders it still the more just But our present Idea of the Fly is indeed very low as taken from the Littleness and Insignificancy of this Creature However since there is really no Meanness in it there ought to be none in expressing it and I have done my best in the Translation to keep up the Dignity of my Author  XXXVII  VERSE  By  Hector  lov'd his Comrade and his Guest    Podes  the Favourite and Companion of  Hector  being kill'd on this Occasion seems a parallel Circumstance to the Death of  Achilles  's Favourite and Companion and was probably put in here on purpose to engage  Hector  on a like Occasion with  Achilles  XXXVIII  VERSE  Some Hero too must be dispatch'd  c  It seems odd that they did not sooner send this Message to  Achilles  but there is some Apology for it from the Darkness and Difficulty of finding a proper Person It was not every body that was proper to send but one who was a particuar Friend to  Achilles  who might condole with him Such was  Antilochus  who is sent afterwards and who besides had that necessary Qualification of being    Eustathius  XXXIX  VERSE  If  Grecce  must perish we thy Will obey  But let us perish in the Face of Day    This Thought has been look'd upon as one of the sublimest in  Homer Longinus  represents it in this manner  "The thickest Darkness had on a sudden cover'd the  Grecian  Army and hinder'd them from fighting When  Ajax  not knowing what Course to take cries out  Oh Jove disperse this Darkness which covers the Greeks and if we  must perish let us perish in the Light  This is a Sentiment truly worthy of  Ajax  he does not pray for Life that had been unworthy a Hero But because in that Darkness he could not employ his Valour to any glorious Purpose and vex'd to stand idle in the Field of Battel he only prays that the Day may appear as being assured of putting an end to it worthy his great Heart tho'  Jupiter  himself should happen to oppose his Efforts"  M  l' Abbè Terasson  in his Dissertation on the Iliad endeavours to prove that  Longinus  has misrepresented the whole Context and Sense of this Passage of  Homer  The Fact says he is that  Ajax  is in a very different Situation in  Homer  from that wherein  Longinus  describes him He has not the least Intention of fighting he thinks only of finding out some fit Person to send to  Achilles  and this Darkness hindering him from seeing such an one is the occasion of his Prayer Accordingly it appears by what follows that as soon as  Jupiter  has dispers'd the Cloud  Ajax  never falls upon the Enemy but in consequence of his former Thought orders  Menelaus  to look for  Antilochus  to dispatch him to  Achilles  with the News of the Death of his Friend  Longinus  continues this Author had certainly forgot the Place from whence he took this Thought and it is not the first Citation from  Homer  which the Ancients have quoted wrong Thus  Aristotle  attributes to  Calypso  the Words of  Ulysses  in the twelfth Book of the Odysseis and confounds together two Passages one of the second the other of the fifteenth Book of the Iliad  Ethic ad Nicom  l c and l c And thus  Cicero  ascribed to  Agamemnon  a long Discourse of  Ulysses  in the second Iliad  De divinatione  l and cited as  Ajax  's the Speech of  Hector  in the seventh See  Aul Gellius  l c One has no cause to wonder at this since the Ancients having  Homer  almost by heart were for that very Reason the more subject to mistake in citing him by Memory  To this I think one may answer that granting it was partly the Occasion of  Ajax  's Prayer to obtain Light in order to send to  Achilles  which he afterwards does yet the Thought which  Longinus  attributes to him is very consistent with it and the last Line expresses nothing else but an  heroic Desire rather to die in the Light than escape with Safety in the Darkness  But indeed the whole Speech is only meant to paint the Concern and Distress of a brave General The Thought of sending a Messenger is only a Result from that Concern and Distress and so but a small Circumstance which cannot be said to occasion the Pray'r  Mons  Boileau  has translated this Passage in two Lines  Grand Dieu chasse la nuit qui nous couvre les yeux  Et combats contre nous a la clarté des Cieux  And Mr  la Motte  yet better in one  Grand Dieu rends nous le jour combats contre nous  But both these as  Dacier  very justly observes are contrary to  Homer  's Sense He is far from representing  Ajax  of such a daring Impiety as to bid  Jupiter  combate against him but only makes him ask for Light that if it be his Will the  Greeks  shall perish they may perish in open Day  says he that is abandon us withdraw from us your Assistance for those who are deserted by  Jove  must perish infallibly This Decorum of  Homer  ought to have been preserv'd  XL  VERSE  The mildest Manners and the gentlest Heart    This is a fine Elogium of  Patroclus Homer  dwells upon it on purpose lest  Achilles  's Character should be mistaken and shews by the Praises he bestows here upon Goodness that  Achilles  's Character is not commendable for Morality  Achilles  's Manners entirely opposite to those of  Patroclus  are not morally good they are only poetically so that is to say they are well mark'd and discover beforehand what Resolutions  that Hero will take As hath been at large explain'd upon  Aristotle  's Poeticks  Dacier  XLI  VERSE  The youthful Warrior heard with silent Woe    Homer  ever represents an Excess of Grief by a deep Horrour Silence Weeping and not enquiring into the manner of the Friend's Death Nor could  Antilochus  have express'd his Sorrow in any manner so moving as Silence  Eustathius  XLII  VERSE  To brave  Laodocus  his Arms he flung    Antilochus  leaves his Armour not only that he might make the more haste but as the Ancients conjecture that he might not be thought to be absent by the Enemies and that seeing his Armour on some other Person they might think him still in the Fight  Eustathius  XLIII  VERSE  But hope not Warriors for Achilles' Aid  Unarm'd    This is an ingenious way of making the Valour of  Achilles  appear the greater who tho' without Arms goes forth in the next Book contrary to the Expectation of  Ajax  and  Menelaus Dacier  XLIV  VERSE  c  This Heap of Images which  Homer  throws together at the End of this Book makes the same Action appear with a very beautiful Variety The  Description  of the burning of a City is short but very lively That of  Ajax  alone bringing up the Rear Guard and shielding those  that bore the Body of  Patroclus  from the whole  Trojan  Host gives a prodigious Idea of  Ajax  and as  Homer  has often hinted makes him just second to  Achilles  The Image of the Beam paints the great Stature of  Patroclus  That of the Hill dividing the Stream is noble and natural  He compares the  Ajaxes  to a Boar for their Fierceness and Boldness to a long Bank that keeps off the Course of the Waters for their standing firm and immoveable in the Battel Those that carry the dead Body to Mules dragging a vast Beam thro' rugged Paths for their Laboriousness The Body carried to a Beam for being heavy and inanimate The  Trojans  to Dogs for their Boldness and to Water for their Agility and moving backwards and forwards The  Greeks  to a Flight of Starlings and Jays for their Timorousness and Swiftness  Eustathius  THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Grief of  Achilles  and new Armour made him by  Vulcan  THE News of the Death of  Patroclus  is brought to  Achilles  by  Antilochus Thetis  hearing his Lamentations comes with all her SeaNymphs to comfort him The Speeches of the Mother and Son on this Occasion  Iris  appears to  Achilles  by the Command of  Juno  and orders him to shew himself at the Head of the Intrenchments The Sight of him turns the Fortune of the Day and the Body of  Patroclus  is carried off by the  Greeks  The  Trojans  call a Council where  Hector  and  Polydamas  disagree in their Opinions but the Advice of the former prevails to remain encamp'd in the Field The Grief of  Achilles  over the Body of  Patroclus  Thetis  goes to the Palace of  Vulcan  to obtain new Arms for her Son The Description of the wonderful Works of  Vulcan  and lastly that noble one of the Shield of  Achilles  The latter part of the nine and twentieth Day and the Night ensuing take up this Book The Scene is at  Achilles  's Tent on the Seashore from whence it changes to the Palace of  Vulcan  THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  THUS like the Rage of Fire the Combat burns  And now it rises now it sinks by turns  Meanwhile where  Hellespont  's broad Waters flow  Stood  Nestor  's Son the Messenger of Woe  There sate  Achilles  shaded by his Sails  On hoisted Yards extended to the Gales  Pensive he sate for all that Fate design'd  Rose in sad Prospect to his boding Mind  Thus to his Soul he said Ah what constrains  The  Greeks  late Victors now to quit the Plains  Is this the Day which Heav'n so long ago  Ordain'd to sink me with the Weight of Woe  So  Thetis  warn'd when by a  Trojan  Hand  The bravest of the  Myrmidonian  Band  Should lose the Light Fulfill'd is that Decree  Fal'n is the Warrior and  Patroclus  he  In vain I charg'd him soon to quit the Plain  And warn'd to shun  Hectorean  Force in vain  Thus while he thinks  Antilochus  appears  And tells the melancholy Tale with Tears  Sad Tydings Son of  Peleus  thou must hear  And wretched I th'unwilling Messenger  Dead is  Patroclus  For his Corps they fight  His naked Corps His Arm's are  Hector  's Right  A sudden Horror shot thro' all the Chief  And wrapt his Senses in the Cloud of Grief  Cast on the Ground with furious Hands he spread  The scorching Ashes o'er his graceful Head  His purple Garments and his golden Hairs  Those he deforms with Dust and these he tears  On the hard Soil his groaning Breast he threw  And roll'd and grovel'd as to Earth he grew  The Virgin Captives with disorder'd Charms  Won by his own or by  Patroclus'  Arms  Rush'd from the Tents with Cries and gath'ring round  Beat their white Breasts and fainted on the Ground  While  Nestor  's Son sustains a manlier Part  And mourns the Warrior with a Warrior's Heart  Hangs on his Arms amidst his frantic Woe  And oft prevents the meditated Blow  Far in the deep Abysses of the Main  With hoary  Nereus  and the watry Train  The Mother Goddess from her crystal Throne  Heard his loud Cries and answer'd Groan for Groan  The circling  Nereids  with their Mistress weep  And all the Seagreen Sisters of the Deep  Thalia Glauce  ev'ry wat'ry Name  Nesaea  mild and Silver  Spio  came  Cymothoe  and

Main  How just a Cause has  Thetis  to complain  How wretched were I mortal were my Fate  How more than wretched in th'immortal State  Sprung from my Bed a godlike Hero came  The bravest far that ever bore the Name  Like some fair Olive by my careful Hand  He grew he flourish'd and adorn'd the Land  To  Troy  I sent him but the Fates ordain  He never never must return again  So short a space the Light of Heav'n to view  So short alas and fill'd with Anguish too  Hear how his Sorrows echo thro' the Shore  I cannot ease them but I must deplore  I go at least to bear a tender part  And mourn my lov'd one with a Mother's Heart  She said and left the Caverns of the Main  All bath'd in Tears the melancholy Train  Attend her Way Wideopening part the Tides  While the long Pomp the silver Wave divides  Approaching now they touch'd the  Trojan  Land  Then two by two ascended up the Strand  Th'immortal Mother standing close beside  Her mournful Offspring to his Sighs reply'd  Along the Coast

Day when all the Pow'rs above  Thy Charms submitted to a mortal Love  Oh had'st thou still a Sister of the Main  Pursu'd the Pleasures of the wat'ry Reign  And happier  Peleus  less ambitious led  A mortal Beauty to his equal Bed  E'er the sad Fruit of thy unhappy Womb  Had caus'd such Sorrows past and Woes to come  For soon alas that wretched Offspring slain  New Woes new Sorrows shall create again  'Tis not in Fate th'Alternate now to give  Patroclus  dead  Achilles  hates to live  Let me revenge it on proud  Hector  's Heart  Let his last Spirit smoak upon my Dart  On these Conditions will I breathe Till then  I blush to walk among the Race of Men  A Flood of Tears at this the Goddess shed  Ah then I see thee dying see thee dead  When  Hector  falls thou dy'stLet  Hector  die  And let me fall  Achilles  made reply  Far lyes  Patroclus  from his native plain  He fell and falling wish'd my Aid in vain  Ah then since from this miserable Day  I cast all hope of my Return away  Since unreveng'd a hundred Ghosts demand  The Fate of  Hector  from  Achilles'  hand  Since here for brutal Courage far renown'd  I live an idle Burden to the Ground  Others in Council fam'd for nobler Skill  More useful to preserve than I to kill  Let meBut oh ye gracious Pow'rs above  Wrath and Revenge from Men and Gods remove  Far far too dear to ev'ry mortal Breast  Sweet to the Soul as

Life's short Harvest yields  Shall I not force some widow'd Dame to tear  With frantic Hands her long dishevell'd Hair  Shall I not force her Breast to heave with Sighs  And the soft Tears to trickle from her Eyes  Yes I shall give the Fair those mournful Charms  In vain you hold meHence my Arms my Arms  Soon shall the sanguine Torrent spread so wide  That all shall know  Achilles  swells the Tide  My Son Coerulean  Thetis  made reply  To Fate submitting with a secret Sigh  The Host to succour and thy Friends to save  Is worthy thee the Duty of the Brave  But can'st thou naked issue to the

Seagreen Sisters plunge beneath the Wave  Thetis  once more ascends the blest Abodes  And treads the brazen Threshold of the Gods  And now the  Greeks  from furious  Hector  's Force  Urge to broad  Hellespont  their headlong Course  Nor yet their Chiefs  Patroclus'  Body bore  Safe thro' the Tempest to the Tented Shore  The Horse the FOot with equal Fury join'd  Pour'd on the Rear and thunder'd close behind  And like a Flame thro' Fields of ripen'd Corn  The Rage of  Hector  o'er the Ranks was born  Thrice the slain Hero by the Foot he drew  Thrice to the Skies the  Trojan  Clamours flew  As oft' th'  Ajaces  his Assault sustain  But check'd he turns repuls'd attacks again  With fiercer Shouts his ling'ring Troops he fires  Nor yields a Step nor form his Post retires  So watchful Sheperds strive to force in vain  The hungry Lion from a Carcase slain  Ev'n yet  Patroclus  had he born away  And all the Glories of th'extended Day  Had not high  Juno  from the Realme of Air  Secret dispatch'd her trusty Messenger  The various Goddess of the painted Bow  Shot in a Whirlwind to the Shore below  To great  Achilles  at his Ships she came  And thus began the manycolour'd Dame  Rise Son of  Peleus  rise divinely brave  Assist the Combate and  Patroclus  save  For him the Slaughter to the Fleet they spread  And fall by mutual Wounds around the Dead  To drag him back to  Troy  the Foe contends  Nor with his Death the Rage of  Hector  ends  A Prey to Dogs he dooms the Corse to lye  And marks the Place to fix his Head on high  Rise and prevent if yet thou think of Fame  Thy

strong Lance around him heaps the Dead  The gallant Chief defends  Menoetius'  Son  And does what his  Achilles  should have done  Thy want of Arms said  Iris  well we know  But tho' unarm'd yet clad in Terrors go  Let but  Achilles  o'er yon' Trench appear  Proud  Troy  shall tremble and consent to fear  Greece  from one Glance of that tremendous Eye  Shall take new Courage and disdain to fly  She spoke and past in Air The Hero rose  Her  Aegis Pallas  o'er his Shoulders throws  Around his Brows a golden Cloud she spread  A Stream of Glory flam'd above his Head  As when from some beleagur'd Town arise  The Smokes highcurling to the shaded Skies  Seen from some Island o'er the Main afar  When Men distrest hang out the Sign of War  Soon as the Sun in Ocean hides his Rays  Thick on the Hills the flaming Beacons blaze  With longprojected Beams the Seas are bright  And Heav'ns high Arch reflects the ruddy Light  So from  Achilles'  Head the Splendours rise  Reflecting Blaze on Blaze against the Skies  Forth march'd the Chief and distant from the Croud  High on the Rampart rais'd his Voice aloud  With her own Shout  Minerva  swells the Sound  Troy  starts astonish'd and the Shores rebound  As the loud Trumpet's brazen Mouth from far  With shrilling Clangor sounds th' Alarm of War  Struck from the Walls the Echoes float on high  And the round Bulwarks and thick Tow'rs reply  So high his brazen Voice the Hero rear'd  Hosts drop their Arms and trembled as they heard  And back the Chariots roll and Coursers bound  And Steeds and Men lye mingled on the Ground  Aghast they see the living Light'nings play  And turn their Eyeballs from the flashing Ray  Thrice from the Trench his dreadful Voice he rais'd  And thrice they fled confounded and amaz'd  Twelve in the Tumult wedg'd untimely rush'd  On their own Spears by their own Chariots crush'd  While shielded from the Darts the  Greeks  obtain  The longcontended Carcase of the Slain  A lofty Bier the breathless Warrior bears  Around his sad Companions melt in Tears  But chief  Achilles  bending down his Head  Pours unavailing Sorrows o'er the Dead  Whom late triumphant with his Steeds and Car  He sent refulgent to the Field of War  Unhappy Change now senseless pale he found  Stretch'd forth and gash'd with many a gaping Wound  Meantime unweary'd with his heavenly Way  In Ocean's Waves th'unwilling Light of Day  Quench his red Orb at  Juno  's high Command  And from their Labours eas'd th'  Achaian  Band  The frighted  Trojans  panting from the War  Their Steeds unharness'd from the weary Car  A sudden Council call'd Each Chief appear'd  In haste and standing for to sit they fear'd  'Twas now no Season for prolong'd Debate  They saw  Achilles  and in him their Fate  Silent they stood  Polydamas  at last  Skill'd to discern the Future by the past  The Son of  Panthus  thus exprest his Fears  The Friend of  Hector  and of equal Years  The self same Night to both a Being gave  One wise in Council one in Action brave  In free Debate my Friends your Sentence speak  For me I move before the Morning break  To raise our Camp Too dang'rous here our Post  Far from  Troy  Walls and on a naked Coast  I deem'd not  Greece  so dreadful while engag'd  In mutual Feuds her King and Hero rag'd  Then while we hop'd our Armies might prevail  We boldly camp'd beside a thousand Sail  I dread  Pelides  now his Rage of Mind  Not long continues to the Shores confin'd  Nor to the Fields where long in equal Fray  Contending Nations won and lost the Day  For  Troy  for  Troy  shall henceforth be the Strife  And the hard Contest not for Fame but Life  Haste then to  Ilion  while the fav'ring Night  Detains those Terrors keeps that Arm from Fight  If but the Morrow's Sun behold us here  That Arm those Terrors we shall feel not fear  And Hearts that now disdain shall leap with Joy  If Heav'n permits them then to enter  Troy  Let not my fatal Prophecy be true  Nor what I tremble but to think ensue  Whatever be our Fate yet let us try  What Force of Thought and Reason can supply  Let us on Counsel for our Guard depend  The Town her Gates and Bulwarks shall defend  When Morning dawns our wellappointed Pow'rs  Array'd in Arms shall line the lofty Tow'rs  Let the fierce Hero then when Fury calls  Vent his mad Vengeance on our rocky Walls  Or fetch a thousand Circles round the Plain  Till his spent Coursers seek the Fleet again  So may his Rage be tir'd and labour'd down  And Dogs shall tear him e'er he sack the Town  Return said  Hector  fir'd with stern Disdain  What coop whole Armies in our Walls again  Was't not enough ye valiant Warriors say  Nine Years imprison'd in those Tow'rs ye lay  Wide o'er the World was  Ilion  fam'd of old  For Brass exhaustless and for Mines of Gold  But while inglorious in her Walls we stay'd  Sunk were her Treasures and her Stores decay'd  The  Phrygians  now her scatter'd spoils enjoy  And proud  Maeonia  wasts the Fruits of  Troy  Great  Jove  at length my Arms to Conquest calls  And shuts the  Grecians  in their wooden Walls  Dar'st thou dispirit whom the Gods incite  Flies any  Trojan  I shall stop his Flight  To better Counsel then Attention lend  Take due Refreshment and the Watch attend  If there be one whose Riches cost him Care  Forth let him bring them for the Troops to share  'Tis better gen'rously bestow'd on those  Than left the Plunder of our Country's Foes  Soon as the Morn the rosie  Welkin  warms  Fierce on yon' Navy will we pour our Arms  If great  Achilles  rise in all his Might  His be the Danger I shall stand the Fight  Honor ye Gods or let me gain or give  And live he glorious whosoe'er shall live  Mars  is our common Lord alike to all  And oft' the Victor triumphs but to fall  The shouting Host in loud Applauses join'd  So  Pallas  robb'd the Many of their Mind  To their own Sense condemn'd and left to chuse  The worse Advice the better to refuse  While the long Night extends her sable Reign  Around  Patroclus  mourn'd the  Grecian  Train  Stern in superior Grief  Pelides  stood  Those slaught'ring Arms so us'd to bathe in Blood  Now clasp his claycold Limbs Then gushing start  The Tears and Sighs burst from his swelling Heart  The Lion thus with dreadful Anguish stung  Roars thro' the Desart and demands his Young  When the grim Savage to his rifled Den  Too late returning snuffs the Track of Men  And o'er the Vales and o'er the Forrest bounds  His clam'rous Grief the bellowing Wood resounds  So grieves  Achilles  and impetuous vents  To all his  Myrmidons  his loud Laments  In what vain Promise Gods did I engage  When to console  Menaetius'  feeble Age  I vow'd his muchlov'd Offspring to restore  Charg'd with rich Spoils to fair  Opuntia  's Shore  But mighty  Jove  cuts short with just Disdain  The long long Views of poor designing Man  One Fate the Warrior and the Friend shall strike  And  Troy  's black Sands must drink our Blood alike  Me too a wretched Mother shall deplore  An aged Father never see me more  Yet my  Patroclus  yet a space I stay  Then swift pursue thee on the darksome way  E'er thy dear Relicks in the Grave are laid  Shall  Hector  's Head be offer'd to thy Shade  That with his Arms shall hang before thy Shrine  And twelve the noblest of the  Trojan  Line  Slain by this Hand sad Sacrifice expire  Their Lives effus'd around thy flaming Pyre  Thus let me lie till then thus closely prest  Bathe thy cold Face and sob upon thy Breast  While  Trojan  Captives here thy Mourners stay  Weep all the Night and murmur all the Day  Spoils of my Arms and thine when wasting wide  Our Swords kept time and conquer'd side by side  He spoke and bid the sad Attendants round  Cleanse the pale Corse and wash each honour'd Wound  A massy Caldron of stupendous Frame  They brought and plac'd it o'er the rising Flame  Then heap the lighted Wood the Flame divides  Beneath the Vase and climbs around the Sides  In its wide Womb they pour the rushing Stream  The boiling Water bubbles to the Brim  The Body then they bathe with pious Toil  Embalm the Wounds anoint the Limbs with Oyl  High on a Bed of State extended laid  And decent cover'd with a linen Shade  Last o'er the Dead the milkwhite Linen threw  That done their Sorrows and their Sighs renew  Meanwhile to  Juno  in the Realms above  His Wife and Sister spoke almighty  Jove  At last thy Will prevails Great  Peleus'  Son  Rises in Arms Such Grace thy  Greeks  have won  Say for I know not is their Race divine  And thou the Mother of that martial Line  What Words are these th'Imperial Dame replies  While Anger flash'd from her majestick Eyes  Succour like this a mortal Arm might lend  And such Success mere human Wit attend  And shall not I the second Pow'r above  Heav'ns Queen and Consort of the thund'ring  Jove  Say shall not I one Nation's Fate command  Not wreak my Vengeance on one guilty Land  So they Meanwhile the silverfooted Dame  Reach'd the  Vulcanian  Dome Eternal Frame  High eminent amid the Works divine  Where Heav'ns farbeaming brazen Mansions shine  There the lame Architect the Goddess found  Obscure in Smoak his Forges flaming round  While bath'd in Sweat from Fire to Fire he flew  And puffing loud the roaring Bellows blew  That Day no common Task his Labour claim'd  Full twenty Tripods for his Hall he fram'd  That plac'd on living Wheels of massy Gold  Wond'rous to tell instinct with Spirit roll'd  From Place to Place around the blest Abodes  Selfmov'd obedient to the Beck of Gods  For their fair Handles now o'erwrought with Flow'rs  In Molds

braided Hair  Observ'd her ent'ring her soft Hand she press'd  And smiling thus the wat'ry Queen address'd  What Goddess this unusual Favour draws  All hail and welcome whatsoe'er the Cause  Till now a Stranger in a happy Hour  Approach and taste the Dainties of the Bow'r  High on a Throne with Stars of silver grac'd  And various Artifice the Queen she plac'd  A Footstool at her Feet then calling said  Vulcan  draw near 'tis  Thetis  asks your Aid  Thetis  reply'd the God our Pow'rs may claim  An ever dear and ever honour'd Name  When my proud Mother hurl'd me from the Sky  My aukward Form it seems displeas'd her Eye  She and  Eurynome  my Griefs redrest  Tnd soft receiv'd me on their silver Breast  Ev'n then these Arts employ'd my infant Thought  Chains Bracelets Pendants all their Toys I wrought  Nine Years kept secret in the dark Abode  Secure I lay conceal'd from Man and God  Deep in a cavern'd Rock my Days were led  The rushing Ocean murmur'd o'er my Head  Now since her Presence glads our Mansion say  For such Desert what Service can I pay  Vouchsafe O  Thetis  at our Board to share  The genial Rites and hospitable Fare  While I my Labours of the Forge forego  And bid the roaring Bellows cease to blow  Then from his Anvil the lame Artist rose  Wide with distorted Legs oblique he goes  And stills the Bellows and in order laid  Locks in their Chest his Instruments of Trade  Then with a Sponge the sooty Workman drest  His brawny Arms imbrown'd and hairy Breast  With his huge Scepter grac'd and red Attire  Came halting forth the Sov'reign of the Fire  The Monarch's Steps two Female Forms uphold  That mov'd and breath'd in animated Gold  To whom was Voice and Sense and Science given  Of Works divine such Wonders are in Heav'n  On these supported with unequal Gait  He reach'd the Throne where pensive  Thetis  sate  There plac'd beside her on the shining Frame  He thus address'd the silverfooted Dame  Thee welcome Goddess what Occasion calls  So long a Stranger to these honour'd Walls  'Tis thine fair  Thetis  the Command to lay  And  Vulcan  's Joy and Duty to obey  To whom the mournful Mother thus replies  The crystal Drops stood trembling in her Eyes  Oh  Vulcan  say was ever Breast divine  So pierc'd with Sorrows so o'erwhelm'd as mine  Of all the Goddesses did  Jove  prepare  For  Thetis  only such a Weight of Care  I only I of all the wat'ry Race  By Force subjected to a Man's Embrace  Who sinking now with Age and Sorrow pays  The mighty Fine impos'd on length of Days  Sprung from my Bed a godlike Hero came  The bravest sure that ever bore the Name  Like some fair Plant beneath my careful Hand  He grew he flourish'd and he grac'd the Land  To  Troy  I sent him but his native Shore  Never ah never shall receive him more  Ev'n while he lives he wastes with secret Woe  Nor I a Goddess can retard the Blow  Robb'd of the Prize the  Grecian  Suffrage gave  The King of Nations forc'd his royal Slave  For this he griev'd and till the  Greeks  opprest  Requir'd his Arm he sorrow'd unredrest  Large Gifts they promise and their Elders send  In vainHe arms not but permits his Friend  His Arms his Steeds his Forces to employ  He marches combates almost conquers  Troy  Then slain by  Phoebus    Hector  had the Name  At once resigns his Armour Life and Fame  But thou in Pity by my Pray'r be won  Grace with immortal Arms this shortliv'd Son  And to the Field in martial Pomp restore  To shine with Glory till he shines no more  To her the ArtistGod Thy Griefs resign  Secure what  Vulcan  can is ever thine  O could I hide him from the Fates as well  Or with these Hands the cruel Stroke repell  As I shall forge most envy'd Arms the Gaze  Of wond'ring Ages and the World's Amaze  Thus having said the Father of the Fires  To the black Labours of his Forge retires  Soon as he bade them blow the Bellows turn'd  Their iron Mouths and where the Furnace burn'd  Resounding breath'd At once the Blast expires  And twenty Forges catch at once the Fires  Just as the God directs now loud now low  They raise a Tempest or they gently blow  In hissing Flames huge silver Bars are roll'd  And stubborn Brass and Tin and solid Gold  Before deep fix'd th'eternal Anvils stand  The pond'rous Hammer loads his better Hand  His left with Tongs turns the vex'd Metal round  And thick strong Strokes the doubling Vaults rebound  Then first he form'd th'immense and solid  Shield  Rich various Artifice emblaz'd the Field  Its utmost Verge a threefold Circle bound  A silver Chain suspends the massy Round  Five ample Plates the broad Expanse compose  And godlike Labours on the Surface rose  There shone the Image of the Master Mind  There Earth there Heav'n there Ocean he design'd  Th'unweary'd Sun the Moon compleatly round  The starry Lights that Heav'ns high Convex crown'd  The  Pleiads Hyads  with the Northern Team  And great  Orion  's more refulgent Beam  To which around the Axle of the Sky  The  Bear  revolving points his golden Eye  Still shines exalted on th'aetherial Plain  Nor bends his blazing Forehead to the Main  Two Cities radiant on the Shield appear  The Image one of Peace and one of War  Here sacred Pomp and genial Feast delight  And solemn Dance and  Hymenaeal  Rite  Along the Street the newmade Brides are led  With Torches flaming to the nuptial Bed  The youthful Dancers in a Circle bound  To the soft Flute and Cittern's silver Sound  Thro' the fair Streets the Matrons in a Row  Stand in their Porches and enjoy the Show  There in the  Forum  swarm a num'rous Train  The Subject of Debate a Townsman slain  One pleads the Fine discharg'd which one deny'd  And bade the Publick and the Laws decide  The Witness is produc'd on either Hand  For this or that the partial People stand  Th'appointed Heralds still the noisy Bands  And form a Ring with Scepters in their Hands  On Seats of Stone within the sacred Place  The rev'rend Elders nodded o'er the Case  Alternate each th'attesting Scepter took  And rising solemn each his Sentence spoke  Two golden Talents lay amidst in sight  The Prize of him who best adjudg'd the Right  Another Part a Prospect diff'ring far  Glow'd with refulgent Arms and horrid War  Two mighty Hosts a leaguer'd Town embrace  And one would pillage one wou'd burn the Place  Meantime the Townsmen arm'd with silent Care  A secret Ambush on the Foe prepare  Their Wives their Children and the watchful Band  Of trembling Parents on the Turrets stand  They march by  Pallas  and by  Mars  made bold  Gold were the Gods their radiant Garments Gold  And Gold their Armour These the Squadron led  August Divine Superior by the Head  A Place for Ambush fit they found and stood  Cover'd with Shields beside a silver Flood  Two Spies at distance lurk and watchful seem  If Sheep or Oxen seek the winding Stream  Soon the white Flocks proceeded o'er the Plains  And Steers slowmoving and two Shepherd Swains  Behind them piping on their Reeds they go  Nor fear an Ambush nor suspect a Foe  In Arms the glitt'ring Squadron rising round  Rush sudden Hills of Slaughter heap the Ground  Whole Flocks and Herds lye bleeding on the Plains  And all amidst them dead the Shepherd wains  The bellowing Oxen the Besiegers hear  They rise take Horse approach and meet the War  They fight they fall beside the silver Flood  The waving Silver seem'd to blush with Blood  There Tumult there Contention stood confest  One rear'd a Dagger at a Captive's Breast  One held a living Foe that freshly bled  With newmade Wounds another dragg'd a dead  Now here now there the Carcasses they tore  Fate  stalk'd amidst them grim with human Gore  And the whole War came out and met the Eye  And each bold Figure seem'd to live or die  A Field deep furrow'd next the God design'd  The third time labour'd by the sweating Hind  The shining Shares full many Plowmen guide  And turn their crooked Yokes on ev'ry side  Still as at either End they wheel around  The Master meets 'em with his Goblet crown'd  The hearty Draught rewards renews their Toil  Then back the turning Plowshares cleave the Soil  The newear'd Earth in blacker Ridges roll'd  Sable it look'd tho form'd of molten Gold  Another Field rose high with waving Grain  With bended Sickles stand the ReaperTrain  Here stretch'd in Ranks the level'd Swarths are found  Sheaves heap'd on Sheaves here thicken up the Ground  With sweeping Stroke the Mowers strow the Lands  The Gath'rers follow and collect in Bands  And last the Children in whose Arms are born  Too short to gripe them the brown Sheaves of Corn  The rustic Monarch of the Field descries  With silent Glee the Heaps around him rise  A ready Banquet on the Turf is laid  Beneath an ample Oak's expanded Shade  The VictimOx the sturdy Youth prepare  The Reaper's due Repast the Women's Care  Next ripe in yellow Gold a Vineyard shines  Bent with the pond'rous Harvest of its Vines  A deaper Dye the dangling Clusters show  And curl'd on silver Props in order glow  A darker Metal mixt intrench'd the Place  And Pales of glitt'ring Tin th'Enclosure grace  To this one Pathway gently winding leads  Where march a Train with Baskets on their Heads  Fair Maids and blooming Youths that smiling bear  The purple Product of th'Autumnal Year  To these a Youth awakes the warbling Strings  Whose tender Lay the Fate of  Linus  sings  In measur'd Dance behind him move the Train  Tune soft the Voice and answer to the Strain  Here Herds of Oxen march erect and bold  Rear high their Horns and seem to lowe in Gold  And speed to Meadows on whose sounding Shores  A rapid Torrent thro' the Rushes roars  Four golden Herdsmen as their Guardians stand  And nine sour Dogs compleat the rustic Band  Two Lions rushing from the Wood appear'd  And seiz'd a Bull the Master of the Herd  He roar'd in vain the Dogs the Men withstood  They tore his Flesh and drank the sable Blood  The Dogs oft' chear'd in vain desert the Prey  Dread the grim Terrors and at distance bay  Next this the Eye the Art of  Vulcan  leads  Deep thro' fair Forests and a Length of Meads  And Stalls and Folds and scatter'd Cotts between  And fleecy Flocks that whiten all the Scene  A figur'd Dance succeeds Such once was seen  In lofty  Gnossus  for the  Cretan  Queen  Form'd by  Daedalean  Art A comely Band  Of Youths and Maidens bounding Hand in Hand  The Maids in soft Cymarrs of Linen drest  The Youths all graceful in the glossy Vest  Of those the Locks with flow'ry Wreaths inroll'd  Of these the Sides adorn'd with Swords of Gold  That glitt'ring gay from silver Belts depend  Now all at once they rise at once descend  With welltaught Feet Now shape in oblique ways  Confus'dly regular the moving Maze  Now forth at once too swift for sight they spring  And undistinguish'd blend the flying Ring  So whirls a Wheel in giddy Circle tost  And rapid as it runs the single Spokes are lost  The gazing Multitudes admire around  Two active Tumblers in the Center bound  Now high now low their plaint Limbs they bend  And gen'ral Songs the sprightly Revel end  Thus the broad Shield complete the Artist crown'd  With his last Hand and pour'd the Ocean round  In living Silver seem'd the Waves to roll  And beat the Buckler's Verge and bound the whole  This done whate'er a Warrior's Use requires  He forg'd the Cuirass that outshone the Fires  The Greaves of ductile Tin the Helm imprest  With various Sculpture and the golden Crest  At  Thetis'  Feet the finish'd Labour lay  She as a Falcon cuts th'Aerial way  Swift from  Olympus'  snowy Summit flies  And bears the blazing Present through the Skies  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Eighteenth Book  shield of Achilles  The Shield of Achilles as describ'd in Homers  th  Ilias in Twelve Tables  Three of a Town in Peace  a Marriage an assembly of y  e  People a Senate  Three of a Town in War  The Besieg'd making a Sally Shepherds their Flocks falling into an ambuscade a Combact  Three of Agriculture  Tillage Harvest a Vintage  Three of a Pastoral Life  Lions Herds of Cattle Sheep the Dance  Sam  l  Gribelin Jun  r  Sculp  OBSERVATIONS ON THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK  I  VERSE  Thus like the Rage of Fire  c  This Phrase is usual in our Author to signify a sharp Battel fought with Heat and Fury on both parts such an Engagement like a Flame preying upon all sides and dying the sooner the fiercer it burns  Eustathius  II  VERSE  On hoisted Yards    The Epithet  in this Place has a more than ordinary Sgnification It implies that the Sailyards were hoisted up and  Achilles  's Ships on the point to set sail This shews that it was purely in Compliance to his Friend that he permitted him to succour the  Greeks  he meant to leave 'em as soon as  Patroclus  return'd he still remember'd what he told the Embassadors in the ninth Book ℣  To morrow you shall see my Fleet set sail  Accordingly this is the Day appointed and he is fix'd to his Resolution This Circumstance wonderfully strengthens his implacable Character  III  VERSE  Pensive he sate    Homer  in this artful manner prepares  Achilles  for the fatal Message and gives him these Forebodings of his Misfortunes that they might be no less than he expected  His Expressions are suitable to his Concern and deliver'd confusedly  "I bad him says he after he had sav'd the Ships and repuls'd the  Trojans  to return back and not engage himself too far"  Here he breaks off when he should have added  "But he was so unfortunate as to forget my Advice"  As he is reasoning with himself  Antilochus  comes in which makes him leave the Sense imperfect  Eustathius  IV  VERSE  Fulfill'd is that Decree  Slain is the Warrior and  Patroclus  he  It may be objected that  Achilles  seems to contradict what had been said in the foregoing Book that  Thetis  conceal'd from her Son the Death of  Patroclus  in her Prediction Whereas here he says that she had foretold he should lose the bravest of the  Thessalians  There is nothing in this but what is natural and common among Mankind And it is still more agreeable to the hasty and inconsiderate Temper of  Achilles  not to have made that Reflection till it was too late Prophecies are only Marks of divine Prescience not Warnings to prevent human Misfortunes for if they were they must hinder their own Accomplishment  V  VERSE  Sad Tydings Son of  Peleus  This Speech of  Antilochus  ought to serve as a Model for the Brevity with which so dreadful a piece of News ought to be deliver'd for in two Verses it comprehends  the whole Affair the Death of  Patroclus  the Person that kill'd him the Contest for his Body and his Arms in the Possession of the Enemy Besides it shou'd be observ'd that Grief has so crowded his Words that in these two Verses he leaves the Verb    they fight  without its Nominative  the Greeks  or  Trojans Homer  observes this Brevity upon all the like Occasions The  Greek  Tragic Poets have not always imitated this Discretion In great Distresses there is nothing more ridiculous than a Messenger who begins a long Story with pathetic Descriptions he speaks without being heard for the Person to whom he addresses himself has no time to attend him The first Word which discovers to him his Misfortune has made him deaf to all the rest  Eustathius  VI  VERSE  A sudden Horrour  c  A modern  French  Writer has drawn a Parallel of the Conduct of  Homer  and  Virgil  in relation to the Deaths of  Patroclus  and of  Pallas  The latter is kill'd by  Turnus  as the former by  Hector Turnus  triumphs in the Spoils of the one as  Hector  is clad in the Arms of the other  Aeneas  revenges the Death of  Pallas  by that of  Turnus  as  Achilles  the Death of  Patroclus  by that of  Hector  The Grief of  Achilles  in  Homer  on the score of  Patroclus  is much greater than that of  Aeneas  in  Virgil  for the sake of  Pallas Achilles  gives himself up to Despair with a Weakness which  Plato  could not pardon in him and which can only be excus'd on account of the long and close Friendship between 'em That of  Aeneas  is more discreet and seems more worthy of a Hero It was not possible that  Aeneas  could be so deeply interested for any Man as  Achilles  was interested for  Patroclus  For  Virgil  had no Colour to kill  Ascanius  who was little more than a Child besides that his Hero's Interest in the War of  Italy  was great enough of itself not to need to be animated by so touching a Concern as the fear of losing his Son On the other hand  Achilles  having but very little personal Concern in the War of  Troy  as he had told  Agamemnon  in the beginning of the Poem and knowing besides that he was to perish there required some very pressing Motive to engage him to persist in it after such Disgusts and Insults as he had received It was this which made it necessary for these two great Poets to treat a Subject so much in their own Nature alike in a manner so different But as  Virgil  found it admirable in  Homer  he was willing to approach it as near as the Oeconomy of his Work would permit  VII  VERSE  Cast on the Ground  c  This is a fine Picture of the Grief of  Achilles  We see on the one hand the Posture in which the Hero receives the News of his Friend's Death he falls upon the Ground he rends his Hair he snatches the Ashes and casts them on his Head according to the manner of those Times but what much enlivens it in this place is his sprinkling Embers instead of Ashes in the Violence of his Passion On the other side the Captives are running from their Tents ranging themselves about him and answering to his Groans Beside him stands  Antilochus  fetching deep Sighs and hanging on the Arms of the Hero for fear his Despair and Rage should cause some desperate Attempt upon his own Life There is no Painter but will be touch'd with this Image  VIII  VERSE  The Virgin Captives    The captive Maids lamented either in Pity for their Lord or in Gratitude to the Memory of  Patroclus  who was remarkable for his Goodness and Affability or under these Pretences mourn'd for their own Misfortunes and Slavery  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  Like some fair Plant beneath my careful Hand    This Passage where the Mother compares her Son to a tender Plant rais'd and preserv'd with Care has a most remarkable Resemblance to that in the Psalms  Thy Children like Branches of Olive Trees round thy Table  Psal  X  VERSE  The two Speeches of  Achilles  to  Thetis  It is not possible to imagine more lively and beautiful Strokes of Nature and Passion than those which our Author ascribes to  Achilles  throughout these admirable Speeches They contain all that the truest Friend the most tender Son and the most generous Hero could think or express in this delicate and affecting Circumstance He shews his Excess of Love to his Mother by wishing he had never been born or known to the World rather than she should have endur'd so many Sufferings on his account He shews no less Love for his Friend in resolving to revenge his Death upon  Hector  tho' his own would immediately follow We see him here ready to meet his Fate for the sake of his Friend and in the  Odysseis  we find him wishing to live again only to maintain his Father's Honour against his Enemies Thus he values neither Life nor Death but as they conduce to the Good of his Friend and Parents or the Encrease of his Glory  After having calmly consider'd the present State of his Life he deliberately embraces his approaching Fate and comforts himself under it by a Reflection on those great Men whom neither their illustrious Actions nor their Affinity to Heaven could save from the general Doom A Thought very natural to him whose Business it was in Peace to sing their Praises and in War to imitate their Actions  Achilles  like a Man passionate of Glory takes none but the finest Models he thinks of  Hercules  who was the  Son of  Jupiter  and who had fill'd the Universe with the Noise of his immortal Actions These are the Sentiments of a real Hero  Eustathius  XI  VERSE  Let meBut oh ye gracious Powers  c  Achilles  's Words are these  "Now since I am never to return home and since I lie here an useless Person losing my best Friend and exposing the  Greeks  to so many Dangers by my own Folly I who am superior to them all in Battel  Here he breaks off and saysMay Contention perish everlastingly  c Achilles  leaves the Sentence thus suspended either because in his Heat he had forgot what he was speaking of or because he did not know how to end it for he should have said  "Since I have done all this I'll perish to revenge him"  Nothing can be finer than this sudden Execration against Discord and Revenge which breaks from the Hero in the deep Sense of the Miseries those Passions had occasion'd him  Achilles  could not be ignorant that he was superior to others in Battel and it was therefore no Fault in him to say so But he is so ingenuous as to give himself no farther Commendation than what he undoubtedly merited confessing at the same time that many exceeded him in Speaking Unless one may take this as said in contempt of Oratory not unlike that of  Virgil  Orabunt caussas meliùs  c  XII  VERSE  Let me this instant    I shall have time enough for inglorious Rest when I am in the Grave but now I must act like a living Hero I shall indeed lie down in Death but at the same time rise higher in Glory  Eustathius  XIII  VERSE  That all shall know  Achilles  There is a great Stress on  and  They shall soon find that their Victories have been owing to the  long Absence  of a Hero and that Hero  Achilles  Upon which the Ancients have observ'd that since  Achilles  's Anger there past in reality but a few Days To which it may be reply'd that so short a Time as this might well seem long to  Achilles  who thought all unactive Hours tedious and insupportable and if the Poet himself had said that  Achilles  was long absent he had not said it because a great many Days had past but because so great a Variety of Incidents had happen'd in that Time  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE This Promise of  Thetis  to present her Son with a new Suit of Armour was the most artful Method of hindering him from putting immediately in practice his Resolutions of fighting which according to his violent Manners he must have done Therefore the Interposition of  Thetis  here was absolutely necessary it was  Dignus vindice nodus  XV  VERSE  Who sends thee Goddess  c  Achilles  is amazed that a Moment after the Goddess his Mother had forbid him fighting he shou'd receive a contrary Order from the Gods Therefore he asks what God sent her  Dacier  XVI  VERSE  Arms I have none    It is here objected against  Homer  that since  Patroclus  took  Achilles'  Armour  Achilles  could not want Arms while he had those of  Patroclus  but  besides that  Patroclus  might have given his Armour to his Squire  Automedon  the better to deceive the  Trojans  by making them take  Automedon  for  Patroclus  as they took  Patroclus  for  Achilles  this Objection may be very solidly answer'd by saying that  Homer  has prevented it since he made  Achilles  's Armour fit  Patroclus  's Body not without a Miracle which the Gods wrought in his Favour Furthermore it does not follow that because the Armour of a large Man fits one that is smaller the Armour of a little Man shou'd fit one that is larger  Eustathius  XVII  VERSE  Except the mighty  Telamonian  Shield    Achilles  seems not to have been of so large a Stature as  Ajax  Yet his Shield 'tis likely might be fit enough for him because his great Strength was sufficient to wield it This Passage I think might have been made use of by the Defenders of the Shield of  Achilles  against the Criticks to shew that  Homer  intended the Buckler of his Hero for a very large one And one would think he put it into this place just a little before the Description of that Shield on purpose to obviate that Objection  XVIII  VERSE  But as thou art unarm'd    A Hero so violent and so outragious as  Achilles  and who had just lost the Man he lov'd best in the World is not likely to refuse shewing himself to the Enemy for the single Reason of having no Armour Grief and Despair in a great Soul are not so prudent and reserv'd but then on the other side he is not to throw himself in the midst of so many Enemies arm'd and flush'd with Victory  Homer  gets out of this nice Circumstance with great Dexterity and gives to  Achilles  's Character every thing he ought to give it without offending either against Reason or Probability He judiciously feigns that  Juno  sent this Order to  Achilles  for  Juno  is  the Goddess of Royalty who has the Care of Princes and Kings and who inspires them with the Sense of what they owe to their Dignity and Character  Dacier  XIX  VERSE  Let but  Achilles  o'er yon' Trench appear    There cannot be a greater Instance how constantly  Homer  carry'd his whole Design in his Head as well as with what admirable Art he raises one great Idea upon another to the highest Sublime than this Passage of  Achilles  's Appearance to the Army and the Preparations by which we are led to it In the thirteenth Book when the  Trojans  have the Victory they check their Pursuit of it in the mere Thought that  Achilles sees them  In the sixteenth they are put into the utmost Consternation at the sight of his Armour and Chariot In the seventeenth  Menelaus  and  Ajax  are in Despair on the Consideration that  Achilles  cannot succour them for want of Armour In the present Book beyond all Expectation he does but shew him unarm'd and the very Sight of him gives the Victory to  Greece  How extremely noble is this Gradation  XX  VERSE  The Smokes highcurling    For Fires in the Day appear nothing but Smoak and in the Night Flames are visible because of the Darkness And thus it is said in  Exodus  That God led his People in the Day with a Pillar of Smoak and in the Night with a Pillar of Fire  Per Diem in Columna nubis per Noctem in Columna ignis  Dacier  XXI  VERSE  Seen from some Island    Homer  makes choice of a Town placed in an Island because such a Place being besieg'd has no other Means of making its Distress  known than by Signals of Fire whereas a Town upon the Continent has other Means to make known to its Neighbours the Necessity it is in  Dacier  XXII  VERSE  As the loud Trumpets  c  I have already observ'd that when the Poet speaks as from himself he may be allow'd to take his Comparisons from things which were not known before his Time Here he borrows a Comparison from the  Trumpet  as he has elsewhere done from  SaddleHorses  tho' neither one nor the other were us'd in  Greece  at the time of the  Trojan  War  Virgil  was less exact in this respect for he describes the Trumpet as used in the sacking of  Troy  Exoritur clamorque virûm clangorque tubarum  And celebrates  Misenus  as the Trumpeter of  Aeneas  But as  Virgil  wrote at a time more remote from those heroic Ages perhaps this Liberty may be excused But a Poet had better confine himself to Customs and Manners like a Painter and it is equally a Fault in either of them to ascribe to Times and Nations any thing with which they were unacquainted  One may add an Oservation to this Note of M  Dacier  that the Trumpet's not being in use at that time makes very much for  Homer  's Purpose in this Place The Terror rais'd by the Voice of his Hero is much the more strongly imag'd by a Sound that was unusual and capable of striking more from its very Novelty  XXIII  VERSE  If but the Morrow's Sun  c  Polydamas  says in the Original  "If  Achilles  comes to morrow  in his Armour  There seems to lye an Objection against this Passage  for  Polydamas  knew that  Achilles  's Armour was won by  Hector  he must also know that no other Man's Armour would fit him how then could he know that new Arms were made for him that very Night Those who are resolv'd to defend  Homer  may answer it was by his Skill in Prophecy but to me this seems to be a Slip of our Author's Memory and one of those little  Nods  which  Horace  speaks of  XXIV  VERSE  The Speech of  Hector  Hector  in this severe Answer to  Polydamas  takes up several of his Words and turns them another way  Polydamas  had said    "To Morrow by break of Day let us put on our Arms and defend the Castles and CityWalls"  to which  Hector  replies    "To Morrow by break of Day let us put on our Arms not to defend our selves at home but to fight the  Greeks  before their own Ships  Polydamas  speaking of  Achilles  had said    c  "if he comes after we are within the Walls of our City 'twill be the worse for him for he may drive round the City long enough before he can hurt us"  To which  Hector  answers  "If  Achilles  should come    c  'Twill be "the worse for him as you say because I'll fight him  says  Hector  in reply to  Polydamas  's Saying    But  Hector  is not so far gone in Passion or Pride as to forget himself and accordingly in the next Lines he modestly puts it in doubt which of them shall conquer  Eustathius  XXV  VERSE  Sunk were her Treasures and her Stores decay'd    As well by reason of the Convoys which were necessarily to be sent for with ready Money as by reason of the great  Allowances which were to be given to the auxiliary Troops who came from  Phrygia  and  Maeonia Hector  's Meaning is that since all the Riches of  Troy  are exhausted it is no longer necessary to spare themselves or shut themselves up within their Walls  Dacier  XXVI  VERSE  If there be one  c  This noble and generous Proposal is worthy of  Hector  and at the same time very artful to ingratiate himself with the Soldiers  Eustathius  farther observes that it is said with an Eye to  Polydamas  as accusing him of being rich and of not opening the Advice he had given for any other End than to preserve his great Wealth for Riches commonly make Men Cowards and the Desire of saving them has often occasion'd Men to give Advice very contrary to the publick Welfare  XXVII  VERSE  In what vain Promise    The Lamentation of  Achilles  over the Body of  Patroclus  is exquisitely touch'd It is Sorrow in the extreme but the Sorrow of  Achilles  It is nobly usher'd in by that Simile of the Grief of the Lion An Idea which is fully answer'd in the savage and bloody Conclusion of this Speech One would think by the Beginning of it that  Achilles  did not know his Fate till after his Departure from  Opuntium  and yet how does that agree with what is said of his Choice of the short and active Life rather than the long and inglorious one Or did not he flatter himself sometimes that his Fate might be changed This may be conjectur'd from several other Passages and is indeed the most natural Solution  XXVIII  VERSE  Cleanse the pale Corse  c  This Custom of washing the Dead is continu'd amongst the  Greeks  to this Day and 'tis a pious Duty perform'd by the dearest Friend  or Relation to see it wash'd and anointed with a Perfume after which they cover it with Linen exactly in the manner here related  XXIX  VERSE Jupiter  and  Juno  Virgil  has coppy'd the Speech of  Juno  to  Jupiter Ast ego quae divûm incedo Regina  c But it is exceeding remarkable that  Homer  should upon every Occasion make Marriage and Discord inseperable 'Tis an unalterable Rule with him to introduce the Husband and Wife in a Quarrel  XXX  VERSE  Full twenty Tripods    Tripods were Vessels supported on three Feet with Handles on the Sides they were of several Kinds and for several Uses some were consecrated to Sacrifices some used as Tables some as Seats others hung up as Ornaments on Walls of Houses or Temples these of  Vulcan  have an Addition of Wheels which was not usual which intimates them to be made with Clockwork Mons  Dacier  has commented very well on this Passage If  Vulcan  says he had made ordinary Tripods they had not answer'd the Greatness Power and Skill of a God It was therefore necessary that his Work should be above that of Men To effect this the Tripods were animated and in this  Homer  doth not deviate from the Probability for every one is fully persuaded that a God can do things more difficult than these and that all Matter will obey him What has not been said of the Statues of  Daedalus Plato  writes that they walked alone and if they had not taken care to tie them they would have got loose and run from their Master If a Writer in Prose can speak hyperbollically of a Man may not  Homer  do it much more of a God Nay this Circumstance with which  Homer  has embellish'd his Poem would have had nothing too surprizing tho' these Tripods had been made by a Man for what may not be done in Clockwork by an exact Management of Springs  This Criticism is then ill grounded and  Homer  does not deserve the Ridicule they would cast on him  The same Author applies to this Passage of  Homer  that Rule of  Aristotle Poetic  Chap which deserves to be alledged at large on this Occasion  "When a Poet is accus'd of saying any thing that is impossible we must examine that Impossibility either with respect to  Poetry  with respect to that which is  best  or with respect to  common Fame  First with regard to  Poetry  The  Probable Impossible  ought to be preferr'd to the  Possible which bath no Verisimilitude  and which would not be believ'd and 'tis thus that  Zeuxis  painted his Pieces Secondly with respect to that which is  best  We see that a thing is most excellent and more wonderful this way and that the Originals ought always to surpass Lastly in respect to  Fame  It is prov'd that the Poet need only follow common Opinion All that appears absurd may be also justify'd by one of these three ways or else by the Maxim we have already laid down that it is probable that a great many things may happen against Probability"  A late Critick has taken notice of the Conformity of this Passage of  Homer  with that in the first Chapter of  Ezekiel The Spirit of the living Creatures was in the Wheels when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were listed up the Wheels were lifted up over against them for the Spirit of the living Creature was in the Wheels  XXXI  VERSE  A Footstool at her Feet    It is at this Day the usual Honour paid amongst the  Greeks  to a Visiter of supeperior Quality to set them higher than the rest of the Company and put a Footstool under their Feet See Note on Book This with innumerable other Customs are still preserv'd in the Eastern Nations  XXXII  VERSE Vulcan  draw near 'tis  Thetis  asks your Aid    The Story the Ancients tell of  Plato  's Application of this Verse is worth observing That great Philosopher had in his Youth a strong Inclination to Poetry and not being satisfy'd to compose little Pieces of Gallantry and Amour he tried his Forces in Tragedy and Epic Poetry but the Success was not answerable to his Hopes He compared his Performance with that of  Homer  and was very sensible of the Difference He therefore abandon'd a sort of Writing wherein at best he could only be the second and turn'd his Views to an other wherein he despaired not to become the first His Anger transported him so far as to cast all his Verses into the Fire But while he was burning them he could not help citing a Verse of the very Poet who had caus'd his Chagrin It was the present Line which  Homer  has put into the Mouth of  Charis  when  Thetis  demands Arms for  Achilles  Plato  only inserted his own Name instead of that of  Thetis  Vulcan  draw near 'tis  Plato  asks your Aid  If we credit the Ancients it was the Discontentment his own Poetry gave him that rais'd in him all the Indignation he afterwards express'd against the Art itself In which say they he behaved like those Lovers who speak ill of the Beauties whom they cannot prevail upon  Fraguier Parall de Hom de Platon  XXXIII  VERSE Thetis  reply'd the God our Pow'rs may claim  c  Vulcan  throws by his Work to perform  Thetis  's Request who had laid former Obligations upon him the Poet in this  Example giving us an excellent Precept that Gratitude should take place of all other Concerns  The Motives which should engage a God in a new Travel in the Nighttime upon a Suit of Armour for a Mortal ought to be strong and therefore artfully enough put upon the foot of Gratitude Besides they afford at the same time a noble Occasion for  Homer  to retail his Theology which he is always very fond of  The Allegory of  Vulcan  or Fire according to  Heraclides  is this His Father is  Jupiter  or the  Aether  his Mother  Juno  or the  Air  from whence he fell to us whether by Lightning or otherwise He is said to be lame that is to want Support because he cannot subsist without the continual Subsistance of Fuel The Aetherial Fire  Homer  calls  Sol  or  Jupiter  the inferior  Vulcan  the one wants nothing of Perfection the other is subject to Decay and is restor'd by Accession of Materials  Vulcan  is said to fall from Heaven because at first when the Opportunity of obtaining Fire was not so frequent Men prepared Instruments of Brass by which they collected the Beams of the Sun or else they gain'd it from accidental Lightning that set fire to some combustible Matter  Vulcan  had perish'd when he fell from Heaven unless  Thetis  and  Eurynome  had received him that is unless he had been preserv'd by falling into some convenient Receptacle or subterranean Place and so was afterwards distributed for the common Necessities of Mankind To understand these strange Explications it must be known that  Thetis  is deriv'd from  to  lay up  and  Eurynome  from  and  a  wide Distribution  They are call'd Daughters of the Ocean because the Vapours and Exhalations of the Sea forming themselves into Clouds find Nourishment for Lightnings  XXXIV  VERSE  Two semale Forms  That mov'd and breath'd in animated Gold    It is very probable that  Homer  took the Idea of these from the Statues of  Daedalus  which might be extant in his Time  The Ancients tell us they were made to imitate Life in rolling their Eyes and in all other Motions From whence indeed it should seem that the Excellency of  Daedalus  consisted in what we call Clockwork or the Management of moving Figures by Springs rather than in Sculpture or Imagery And accordingly the Fable of his fitting Wings to himself and his Son is form'd entirely upon the Foundation of the former  XXXV  VERSE  Robb'd of the Prize  c  Thetis  to compass her Design recounts every thing to the Advantage of her Son she therefore suppresses the Episode of the Embassy the Prayers that had been made use of to move him and all that the  Greeks  had suffer'd after the Return of the Ambassadors and artfully puts together two very distant things as if they had follow'd each other in the same Moment He declin'd says she to succour the  Greeks  but he sent  Patroclus  Now between his refusing to help the  Greeks  and his sending  Patroclus  terrible things had fallen out but she suppresses them for fear of offending  Vulcan  with the recital of  Achilles  's inflexible Obduracy and thereby create in that God an Aversion to her Son  Eustathius  XXXVI  VERSE  Then slain by  Phoebus Hector  had the Name    It is a Passage worth taking notice of that  Brutus  is said to have consulted the  Sortes Homericae  and to have drawn one of these Lines wherein the Death of  Patroclus  is ascribed to  Apollo  After which unthinkingly he gave the Name of that God for the Word of Battel This is remarked as an unfortunate Omen by some of the Ancients tho' I forget where I met with it  XXXVII  VERSE  The Father of the Fires  c  The Ancients says  Eustathius  have largely celebrated the philosophical Mysteries  which they imagined to be shadowed under these Descriptions especially  Damo  suppos'd the Daughter of  Pythagoras  whose Explication is as follows  Thetis  who receives the Arms means the apt Order and Disposition of all things in the Creation By the Fire and the Wind rais'd by the Bellows are meant  Air  and  Fire  the most active of all the Elements The Emanations of the Fire are those  golden Maids  that waited on  Vulcan  The circular Shield is the  World  being of a sphaerical Figure The Gold the Brass the Silver and the Tin are the  Elements  Gold is Fire the firm Brass is Earth the Silver is Air and the soft Tin Water And thus far say they  Homer  speaks a little obscurely but afterwards he names 'em expressly  to which for the fourth Element you must add  Vulcan  who makes the Shield The extreme Circle that run round the Shield which he calls  splendid  and  threefold  is the Zodiack threefold for its Breadth within which all the Planets move splendid because the Sun passes always thro' the midst of it The silver Handle by which the Shield is fastened at both Extremities is the  Axis  of the World imagin'd to pass thro it and upon which it turns The five folds are those parallel Circles that divide the World the  Polar  the  Tropicks  and the  Aequator  Heraclides Ponticus  thus pursues the Allegory  Homer  says he makes the working of his Shield that is the World to be begun by  Night  as indeed all Matter lay undistinguish'd in an original and universal  Night  which is called  Chaos  by the Poets  To bring the matter of the Shield to Separation and Form  Vulcan  presides over the Work or as we may say an  essential Warmth All things  says  Heraclitus being made by the Operation of Fire  And because the  Architect  is at this time to give a Form and Ornament to the World he is making it is not rashly that he is said to be married to one of the Graces  On the broad Shield the  Maker's  Hand engraves  The Earth and Seas beneath the Pole above  The Sun unwearied and the circled Moon  Thus in the Beginning of the World he first lays the Earth as the Foundation of a Building whose Vacancies are fill'd up with the Flowings of the Sea Then he spreads out the Sky for a kind of divine Roof over it and lights the Elements now separated from their former Confusion with the  Sun  the  Moon  And all those Stars that crown the Skies with Fire  Where by the Word  crown  which gives the Idea of Roundness he again hints at the Figure of the World and tho' he cou'd not particularly name the Stars like  Aratus  who profess'd to write upon them yet he has not omitted to mention the principal From hence he passes to represent two  Allegorical  Cities one of  Peace  the other of  War Empedocles  seems to have taken from  Homer  his Assertion that all Things had their Original from  Strife  and  Friendship  All these Refinements not to call 'em absolute Whimsies I leave just as I found 'em to the Reader's Judgment or Mercy  XXXVIII  VERSE  Nor bends his blazing Forehead to the Main    The Criticks have made use of this Passage to prove that  Homer  was ignorant of Astronomy since he believ'd that the  Bear  was the only Constellation which never bathed itself in the Ocean that is to say that did not set and was always visible for say they this is common to other Constellations of the Artick Circle as the lesser Bear the Dragon the greatest part of  Cepheus c  To salve  Homer Aristotle  answers That he calls it the only one to shew that 'tis the only one of those Constellations he had spoken of or that he has put the  only  for the  principal  or the  most known Strabo  justifies this after another manner in the Beginning of his first Book  "Under the Name of the  Bear  and the  Chariot Homer  comprehends all the Artick Circle for there being several other Stars in that Circle which never set he could not say that the Bear was the only  one which did not bath itself in the Ocean wherefore those are deceived who accuse the Poet of Ignorance as if he knew one Bear only when there are two for the lesser was not found out in his Time The  Phoenicians  were the first who observ'd it and made use of it in their Navigation and the Figure of that Sign passed from them to the  Greeks  The same thing happen'd in regard to the Constellation of  Berenice  's Hair and that of  Canopus  which receiv'd those Names very lately and as  Aratus  says well there are several other Stars which have no Names  Crates  was then in the wrong to endeavour to correct this Passage in putting  for  for he tries to avoid that which there is no occasion to avoid  Heraclitus  did better who put the Bear for the Artick Circle as  Homer  has done  The Bear  says he  is the Limit of the rising and setting of the Stars  "  Now it is the  Artic Circle  and not the  Bear  which is that Limit  "'Tis therefore evident that by the Word  Bear  which he calls the  Waggon  and which he says observes  Orion  he understands the Artick Circle that by the Ocean he means the Horizon where the Stars rise and set and by those Words  which turns in the same place and doth not bath itself in the Ocean  he shews that the Artick Circle is the most Northern Part of the Horizon  c  Dacier  on  Arist  Mons  Terasson  combates this Passage with great Warmth But it will be a sufficient Vindication of our Author to say that some other Constellations which are likewise perpetually above the Horizon in the Latitude where  Homer  writ were not at that time discovered and that whether  Homer  knew that the Bear's not setting was occasion'd by the Latitude and that in a smaller Latitude it would set is of no consequence for if he had known it it was still more poetical not to take notice of it  XXXIX  VERSE  Two Cities  c  In one of these Cities are represented all the Advantages of  Peace  And it was impossible  to have chosen two better Emblems of Peace than  Marriages  and  Justice  'Tis said this City was  Athens  for Marriages were first instituted there by  Cecrops  and Judgment upon Murder was first founded there The ancient State of  Attica  seems represented in the neighbouring Fields where the Ploughers and Reapers are at work and a King is overlooking them for  Triptolemus  who reigned there was the first who sowed Corn This was the Imagination of  Agallias Cercyreus  as we find him cited by  Eustathius  XL  VERSE  The Fine discharg'd    Murder was not always punish'd with Death or so much as Banishment but when some Fine was paid the Criminal was suffer'd to remain in the City So  Iliad      If a Brother bleed  On just Atonement we remit the Deed  A Sire the Slaughter of his Son forgives  The Price of Blood discharg'd the Murd'rer lives  XLI  VERSE  The Prize of him who best adjudg'd the Right    Eustathius  informs us that it was anciently the Custom to have a Reward given to that Judge who pronounced the best Sentence M  Dacier  opposes this Authority and will have it that this Reward was given to the Person who upon the Decision of the Suit appear'd to have the justest Cause The Difference between these two Customs in the Reason of the thing is very great For the one must have been an Encouragement to Justice the other a Provocation to Dissension  It were to be wanting in a due Reverence to the Wisdom of the Ancients and of  Homer  in particular not to chuse the former Sense And I have the Honour to be confirmed in this Opinion by the ablest Judge as well as the best Practiser of Equity my Lord  Harcourt  at whose Seat I translated this Book  XLII  VERSE  Another Part a Prospect diff'rent far  c  The same  Agallias  cited above would have this City in War to be meant of  Eleusina  but upon very slight Reasons What is wonderful is that all the Accidents and Events of  War  are set before our Eyes in this short Compass The several Scenes are excellently dispos'd to represent the whole Affair Here is in the space of thirty Lines a Siege a Sally an Ambush the Surprize of a Convoy and a Battel with scarce a single Circumstance proper to any of these omitted  XLIII  VERSE  A Field deepfurrow'd  c  Here begin the Descriptions of rural Life in which  Homer  appears as great a Master as in the great and terrible Parts of Poetry One wou'd think he did this on purpose to rival his Contemporary  Hesiod  on those very Subjects to which his Genius was particularly bent Upon this Occasion I must take notice of that  Greek  Poem which is commonly ascribed to  Hesiod  under the Title of  Some of the Ancients mention such a Work as  Hesiod  's but that amounts to no Proof that this is the same Which indeed is not an express Poem upon the Shield of  Hercules  but Fragment of the Story of that Hero What regards the Shield is a manifest Copy from this of  Achilles  and consequently it is not of  Hesiod  For if he was not more Ancient he was at least Contemporary with  Homer  And neither of them could be supposed to borrow so shamelesly from the other not only the Plan of entire Descriptions as  those of the Marriage the Harvest the Vineyard the Ocean round the Margin  c  but also whole Verses together Those of the  Parca  in the Battel are repeated Word for Word    And indeed half the Poem is but a sort of  Cento  compos'd out of  Homer  's Verses The Reader needs only cast an Eye on these two Descriptions to see the vast Difference of the Original and the Copy and I dare say he will readily agree with the Sentiment of Monsieur  Dacier  in applying to them that famous Verse of  Sannazarius  Illum hominem dices hunc posuisse Deum  XLIV  VERSE  id  I ought not to forget the many apparent Allusions to the Descriptions on this Shield which are to be found in those Pictures of Peace and War the City and Countrey in the eleventh Book of  Milton  Who was doubtless fond of any Occasion to shew how much he was charm'd with the Beauty of all these lively Images He makes his Angel paint those Objects which he shews to  Adam  in the Colours and almost the very Strokes of  Homer  Such is that Passage of the Harvestfield  His Eye he open'd and beheld a Field  Part Arable and Tilth whereon were Sheaves  Newreap'd the other Part Sheepwalks and Folds  In midst an Altar as the Landmark stood  Rustic of grassy sord  c  That of the Marriages  They light the nuptial Torch and bid invoke  Hymen  then first to marriage Rites invok'd  With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound  But more particularly the following Lines are in a manner a Translation of our Author  One way a Band select from Forage drives  A Herd of Beeves fair Oxen and fair Kine  From a fat Meadowground or fleecy Flock  Ewes and their bleating Lambs across the Plain  Their Booty Scarce with Life the Shepherds fly  But call in Aid which makes a bloody Fray  With cruel Tournament the Squadrons join  Where Cattel pastur'd late now scatter'd lies  With Carcasses and Arms th'ensanguin'd Field  DesertedOthers to a City strong  Lay siege encamp'd by Battery Scale and Mine  Assaulting others from the Wall defend  With Dart and Jav'lin Stones and sulph'rous Fire  On each hand Slaughter and gigantic Deeds  In other part the scepter'd Heralds call  To Council in the City Gates anon  Greyheaded Men and grave with Warriors mixt  Assemble and Harangues are heard  XLV  VERSE  The rustic Monarch of the Field    Dacier  takes this to be a piece of Ground given to a Hero in reward of his Services It was in no respect unworthy such a Person in those Days to see his Harvest got in and to overlook his Reapers It is very conformable to the Manners of the ancient Patriarchs such as they are describ'd to us in the Holy Scriptures  XLVI  VERLE  The Fate of  Linus  There are two Interpretations of this Verse in the Original That which I have chosen is confirm'd by the Testimony of  Herodotus  lib and  Pausanias Boeoticis Linus  was the most ancient Name in Poetry the first upon Record who invented Verse and Measure among the  Grecians  He past for the Son of  Apollo  or  Mercury  and was Praeceptor to  Hercules Thamyris  and  Orpheus  There was a solemn Custom among the  Greeks  of bewailing annually the Death of their first Poet  Pausanias  informs us that before the yearly Sacrifice to the Muses on Mount  Helicon  the Obsequies of  Linus  were perform'd who had a Statue and Altar erected to him in that Place  Homer  alludes to that Custom in this Passage and was doubtless fond of paying this Respect to the old Father of Poetry  Virgil  has done the same in that Fine Celebration of him  Eclog    Tum canit errantem Permessi ad flumina Gallum  Utque viro Phoebi chorus assurrexerit omnis  Ut  Linus  haec illi divino carmine pastor  Floribus atque apio crines ornatus amaro  Dixerit  c  And again in the fourth  Eclog  Non me carminibus vincet nec  Thracius Orpheus  Nec  Linus  huic Mater quamvis at{que} huic Pater adsit  Orpheo Calliopea Lino  formosus  Apollo  XLVII  VERSE  A figur'd Dance    There were two sorts of Dances the Pyrrhick and the common Dance  Homer  has joyn'd both in this Description We see the Pyrrhick or Military is perform'd by the Youths who have Swords on the other by the Virgins crown'd with Garlands  Here the ancient Scholiasts say that whereas before it was the Custom for Men and Women to dance separately the contrary Practice was afterwards brought in by seven Youths and as many Virgins who were sav'd by  Theseus  from the Labyrinth and that this Dance was taught them by  Daedalus  To which  Homer  here alludes See  Dion Halic Hist  l c  It is worth observing that the  Grecian  Dance is still perform'd in this manner in the  Oriental  Nations The Youths and Maids dance in a Ring beginning slowly by Degrees the Musick plays a quicker time till at last they dance with the utmost Swiftness And towards the Conclusion they sing as it is said here in a general Chorus  OBSERVATIONS ON THE SHIELD of  ACHILLES  THE Poet intending to shew in its full Lustre his Genius for Description makes choice of this Interval from Action and the Leisure of the Night to display that Talent at large in the famous Buckler of  Achilles  His Intention was no less than to draw the Picture of the whole World in the Compass of this Shield We first see the Universe in general the Heavens are spread the Stars are hung up the Earth is stretched forth the Seas are pour'd round We next see the World in a nearer and more particular view the Cities delightful in Peace or formidable in War the Labours of the Countrey and the Fruit of those Labours in the Harvests and the Vintages the Pastoral Life in its Pleasures and its Dangers In a word all the Occupations all the Ambitions and all the Diversions of Mankind This noble and comprehensive Design he has executed in a manner that challeng'd the Admiration of all the Ancients And how right an Idea they had of this grand Design may be judg'd from that Verse of  Ovid Met  where he calls it  Clypeus  vasti  coelatus imagine  mundi  It is indeed astonishing how after this the Arrogance of some Moderns could unfortunately chuse the noblest Part of the noblest Poet for the Object of their blind Criticisms  I design to give the Reader the Sum of what has been said on this Subject First a Reply to the loose and scatter'd Objections of the Criticks by M  Dacier  Then the regular Plan and Distribution of the Shield by Mons  Boivin  And lastly I shall attempt what has not yet been done to consider it as a Work of  Painting  and prove it in all respects conformable to the most just Ideas and establish'd Rules of that Art  I  It is the Fate says M  Dacier  of these Arms of  Achilles  to be still the Occasion of Quarrels and Disputes  Julius Scaliger  was the first who appear'd against this Part and was follow'd by a whole Herd These object in the first place that 'tis impossible to represent the Movement of the Figures and in condemning the manner they take the Liberty to condemn also the Subject which they say is trivial and not well understood 'Tis certain that  Homer  speaks of the Figures on this Buckler as if they were alive And some of the Ancients taking his Expressions to the Strictness of the Letter did really believe that they had all sorts of Motion  Eustathius  shewed the Absurdity of that Sentiment by a Passage of  Homer  himself  "That Poet says he to shew that his Figures are not animated as some have pretended by an excessive Affection for the Prodigious took care to say that they  moved and fought  as if  they were living Men  "  The Ancients certainly founded this ridiculous Opinion on a Rule of  Aristotle  For they thought the Poet could not make his Description more  admirable  and  marvellous  than in making his Figures animated since as  Aristotle  says the  Original should always excel the Copy  That Shield is the Work of a God 'Tis the Original of which the Engraving and Painting of Men is but an imperfect Copy and there is nothing impossible to the Gods But they did not perceive that by this  Homer  would have  fallen into an extravagant Admirable which would not have been probable Therefore 'tis without any Necessity  Eustathius  adds  "That 'tis possible all those Figures did not stick close to the Shield but that they were detach'd from it and mov'd by Springs in such a manner that they appear'd to have Motion as  Aeschylus  has feign'd something like it in his  seven Captains against  Thebes"  But without having recourse to that Conjecture we can shew that there is nothing more simple and natural than the Description of that Shield and there is not one Word which  Homer  might not have said of it if it had been the Work of a Man for there is a great deal of difference between the Work itself and the Description of it  Let us examine the Particulars for which they blame  Homer  They say he describes two Towns on his Shield which  speak different Languages  'Tis the  Latin  Translation and not  Homer  that says so the Word  is a common Epithet of Men and which signifies only that they have  an articulate Voice  These Towns could not speak different Languages since as the Ancients have remarked they were  Athens  and  Eleusina  both which spake the same Language But tho' that Epithet should signify  which spake different Languages  there would be nothing very surprizing for  Virgil  said what  Homer  it seems must not  Victae longo ordine gentes  Quam variae linguis  Aen  If a Painter should put into a Picture one Town of  France  and another of  Flanders  might not one say they were two Towns which spake different Languages  Homer  they tell us says in another place that  we hear the Harangues of two Pleaders  This is an unfair Exaggeration He only says  Two Men pleaded  that is were represented pleading Was not the same said by  Pliny  of  Nicomachus  that he had painted two  Greeks  which spake one after another Can we express ourselves otherwise of these two Arts which tho' they are mute yet have a Language  Or in explaining a Painting of  Raphael  or  Poussin  can we prevent animating the Figures in making them speak conformably to the Design of the Painter But how could the Engraver represent those young Shepherds and Virgins that dance first in a Ring and then in Setts Or those Troops which were in Ambuscade This would be difficult indeed if the Workman had not the Liberty to make his Persons appear in different Circumstances All the Objections against the young Man who sings at the same time that he plays on the Harp the Bull that roars whilst he is devoured by a Lion and against the musical Consorts are childish for we can never speak of Painting if we banish those Expressions  Pliny  says of  Apelles  that he painted  Clytus  on Horseback going to Battel and demanding his Helmet of his Squire Of  Aristides  that he drew a Beggar whom we could almost understand  pene cum voce  Of  Ctesilochus  that he had painted  Jupiter  bringing forth  Bacchus  and crying out like a Woman  muliebriter ingemiscentem  And of  Nicearchus  that he had drawn a Piece in which  Hercules  was seen very melancholy for having been a Fool  Herculem tristem Insaniae poenitentiâ  No one sure will condemn those ways of Expression which are so common The same Author has said much more of  Apelles  he tells us he painted those things which could not be painted as Thunder  Pinxit quae pingi non possunt  And of  Timanthus  that in all his Works there was something more understood than was seen and tho' there was all the Art imaginable yet there was still more Ingenuity than Art  Atque in omnibus ejus operibus intelligitur plus semper quàm pingitur cùm Ars summa sit Ingenium tamen ultra Artem est  If we take the pains to compare these Expressions with those of  Homer  we shall find him altogether excusable in his  Manner  of describing the Buckler  We come now to the  Matter  If this Shield says a modern Critick had been made in a wiser Age it would have been more correct and less charg'd with Objects There are two things which cause the Censurers to fall into this false Criticism The first is that they think the Shield was no broader than the brims of a Hat whereas it was large enough  to cover a whole Man The other is that they did not know the Design of the Poet and imagined this Description was only the Whimsy of an irregular Wit who did it by chance and not following Nature for they never so much as enter'd into the Intention of the Poet nor knew the Shield was design'd as a Representation of the Universe  'Tis happy that  Virgil  has made a Buckler for  Aeneas  as well as  Homer  for  Achilles  The  Latin  Poet who imitated the  Greek  one always took care to accommodate those things which Time had chang'd so as to render them agreeable to the Palate of his Readers yet he hath not only charg'd his Shield with a great deal more Work since he paints all the Actions of the  Romans  from  Ascanius  to  Augustus  but has not avoided any of those manners of Expression which offend the Criticks We see there the Wolf of  Romulus  and  Remus  who gives them her Dugs  one after another Mulcere alternos Corpora fingere Linguâ  The Rape of the  Sabines  and the War which follow'd it  subitoque novum consurgere Bellum Metius  torn by four Horses and  Tullus  who draws his Entrails thro' the Forest  Porsenna  commanding the  Romans  to receive  Tarquin  and besieging  Rome  The Geese flying to the Porches of the Capitol and giving notice by their  Cries  of the Attack of the  Gauls  At{que} hic auratis volitans argenteus Anser  Porticibus Gallos in Limine adesse  canebat  We see the  Salian  Dance Hell and the Pains of the Damn'd and farther off the Place of the Blessed where  Cato  presides We see the famous Battel of  Actium  where we may distinguish the Captains  Agrippa  with the Gods and the Winds favourable and  Anthony  leading on all the Forces of the  East Egypt  and the  Bactrians  The Fight begins The Sea is red with Blood  Cleopatra  gives the Signal for a Retreat and calls her Troops with a  Systrum Patrio vocat agmina Systro  The Gods or rather the Monsters of  Egypt  fight against  Neptune Venus Minerva Mars  and  Apollo  We see  Anthony  's Fleet beaten and the  Nile  sorrowfully opening  his Bosom to receive the Conquer'd  Cleopatra  looks pale and almost dead at the Thought of that Death she had already determined nay we see the very Wind  Iapis  which hastens her Flight We see the three Triumphs of  Augustus  that Prince consecrates three hundred Temples the Altars are fill'd with Ladies offering up Sacrifices  Augustus  sitting at the Entrance of  Apollo  's Temple receives Presents and hangs them on the Pillars of the Temple while all the conquer'd Nations pass by who  speak different Languages  and are differently equipp'd and arm'd  Incedunt victae longo ordine Gentes  Quam variae Linguis habitu tum vestis armis  Nothing can better justify  Homer  or shew the Wisdom and Judgment of  Virgil  He was charm'd with  Achilles  's Shield and therefore would give the same Ornament to his Poem But as  Homer  had painted the Universe he was sensible that nothing remain'd for him to do he had no other way to take than that of Prophecy and shew what the Descendant of his Hero should perform and he was not afraid to go beyond  Homer  because there is nothing improbable in the Hands of a God If the Criticks say that this is justifying one Fault by another I desire they would agree among themselves for  Scaliger  who was the first that condemn'd  Homer  's Shield admires  Virgil  's but suppose they should agree 'twould be foolish to endeavour to persuade us that what  Homer  and  Virgil  have done by the Approbation of all Ages is not good and to make us think that their particular Taste should prevail over that of all other Men Nothing is more ridiculous than to trouble one's self to answer Men who shew so little Reason in their Criticisms that we can do them no greater Favour than to ascribe it to their Ignorance  Thus far the Objections are answer'd by Mons  Dacier  Since when some others have been started as that the Objects represented on the Buckler have no reference to the Poem no Agreement with  Thetis  who procur'd it  Vuloan  who made it or  Achilles  for whom it was made  To this it is reply'd that the Representation of the Sea was agreeable enough to  Thetis  that the Spheres and celestial Fires were so to  Vulcan  tho' the truth is any piece of Workmanship was equally fit to come from the Hands of this God and that the Images of a Town besieg'd a Battel and an Ambuscade were Objects sufficiently proper for  Achilles  But after all where was the Necessity that they should be so They had at least been as fit for one Hero as for another and  Aeneas  as  Virgil  tells us knew not what to make of the Figures on his Shield  Rerumque Ignarus imagine gaudet  II  But still the main Objection and that in which the Vanity of the Moderns has triumph'd the most is that the Shield is crowded with such a Multiplicity of Figures as could not possibly be represented in the Compass of it The late Dissertation of Mons  Boivin  has put an end to this Cavil and the Reader will have the Pleasure to be convinced of it by ocular Demonstration in the Print annexed  This Author supposes the Buckler to have been perfectly round He divides the convex Surface into four concentrick Circles  The Circle next the Center contains the Globe of the Earth and the Sea in miniature He gives this Circle the Dimension of three Inches  The second Circle is allotted for the Heavens and the Stars He allows the Space of ten Inches between this and the former Circle  The third shall be eight Inches distant from the second The Space between these two Circles shall be divided into twelve Compartiments each of which makes a Picture of ten or eleven Inches deep  The fourth Circle makes the Margin of the Buckler And the Interval between this and the former being of three Inches is sufficient to represent the Waves and Currents of the Ocean  All these together make but four Foot in the whole in Diameter The Print of these Circles and Divisions will serve to prove that the Figures will neither be crowded nor confused if disposed in the proper Place and Order  As to the Size and Figure of the Shield it is evident from the Poets that in the time of the  Trojan  War there were Shields of an extraordinary Magnitude The Buckler of  Ajax  is often compar'd by  Homer  to a Tower and in the sixth Iliad that of  Hector  is described to cover him from the Shoulders to the Ankles  ℣  In the second Verse of the Description of this Buckler of  Achilles  it is said that  Vulcan  cast round it a radiant Circle  ℣  Which proves the Figure to have been round But if it be alledg'd that  as well signifies  oval  as  circular  it may be answer'd that the circular Figure better agrees to the Spheres represented in the Center and to the Course of the Ocean at the Circumference  We may very well allow four Foot Diameter to this Buckler As one may suppose a larger Size would have been too unwieldy so a less would not have been sufficient to cover the Breast and Arm of a Man of a Stature so large as  Achilles  In allowing four Foot Diameter to the whole each of the twelve Compartiments may be of ten or eleven Inches in Depth which will be enough to contain without any Confusion all the Objects which  Homer  mentions Indeed in this Print each Compartiment being but of one Inch the principal Figures only are represented but the Reader may easily imagine the Advantage of nine or ten Inches more However if the Criticks are not yet satisfy'd there is room enough it is but taking in the literal Sense the Words  with which  Homer  begins his  Description and the Buckler may be suppos'd engraven on both Sides which Supposition will double the Size of each Piece The one side may serve for the general Description of Heaven and Earth and the other for all the Particulars  III  IT having been now shewn that the Shield of  Homer  is blameless as to its Design and Disposition and that the Subject so extensive as it is may be contracted within the due Limits not being one vast unproportion'd Heap of Figures but divided into twelve regular Compartiments What remains is to consider this Piece as a complete  Idea  of  Painting  and a Sketch for what one may call an  universal Picture  This is certainly the Light in which it is chiefly to be admired and in which alone the Criticks have neglected to place it  There is reason to believe that  Homer  did in this as he has done in other Arts even in Mechanicks that is comprehend whatever was known of it in his Time if not as is highly probable from thence extend his Ideas yet farther and give a more enlarged Notion of it Accordingly it is very observable that there is scarce a Species or Branch of this Art which is not here to be found whether History BattelPainting Landskip Architecture Fruits Flowers Animals  c  I think it possible that Painting was arrived to a greater Degree of Perfection even at that early Period than is generally supposed by those who have written upon it  Pliny  expresly says that it was not known in the time of the  Trojan  War The same Author and others represent it in a very imperfect State in  Greece  in or near the Days of  Homer  They tell us of one Painter that he was the first who begun to shadow and of another that he fill'd his Outlines only with a single Colour and that laid on every where alike But we may have a higher Notion of the Art from those Descriptions of Statues Carvings Tapestrys Sculptures upon Armour and Ornaments of all kinds which every where occur in our Author as well as from what he says of their Beauty the Relievo and their Emulation of Life itself If we consider how much it is his constant Practice to confine himself to the Custom of the Times whereof he writ it will be hard to doubt but that Painting and Sculpture must have been then in great Practice and Repute  The Shield is not only describ'd as a Piece of Sculpture but of Painting the Outlines may be suppos'd engraved and the rest enamel'd or inlaid with variouscolour'd Metals The Variety of Colours is plainly distinguish'd by  Homer  where he speaks of the  Blackness  of the newopen'd Earth of the  several Colours  of the Grapes and Vines and in other Places The different Metals that  Vulcan  is feign'd to cast into the Furnace were sufficient to afford all the necessary Colours But if to those which are natural to the Metals we add also those which they are capable of receiving from the Operation of Fire we shall find that  Vulcan  had as great a Variety of Colours to make use of as any modern Painter That Enamelling or fixing Colours by Fire was practised very anciently may be conjectur'd from what  Diodorus  reports of one of the Walls of  Babylon  built by  Semiramis  that  the Bricks of it were painted before they were burn'd so as to represent all sorts of Animals  lib chap Now it is but natural to infer that Men had made use of ordinary Colours for the Representation of Objects before they learnt to represent them by such as are given by the Operation of Fire one being much more easy and obvious than the other and that sort of Painting by means of Fire being but an Imitation of the Painting with a Pencil and Colours The same Inference will be farther enforc'd from the Works of Tapestry which the Women of those Times interweaved with many Colours as appears from the Description of that Veil which  Hecuba  offers to  Minerva  in the sixth Iliad and from a Passage in the twenty second where  Andromache  is represented working Flowers in a Piece of this kind They must certainly have known the Use of the Colours themselves for Painting before they could think of dying Threads with those Colours and weaving those Threads close to one another in order only to a more laborious Imitation of a thing so much more easily perform'd by a Pencil This Observation I owe to the  Abbè Fraguier  It may indeed be thought that a Genius so vast and comprehensive as that of  Homer  might carry his Views beyond the rest of Mankind and that in this Buckler of  Achilles  he rather design'd to give a Scheme of what might be perform'd  than a Description of what really was so And since he made a God the Artist he might excuse himself from a strict Confinement to what was known and practised in the Time of the  Trojan  War Let this be as it will it is certain that he had whether by Learning or by Strength of Genius tho' the latter be more glorious for  Homer  a full and exact Idea of Painting in all its Parts that is to say in the  Invention  the  Composition  the  Expression  c  The  Invention  is shewn in finding and introducing in every Subject the  greatest  the most  significant  and most  suitable  Objects Accordingly in every single Picture of the Shield  Homer  constantly finds out either those Objects which are naturally the Principal those which most conduce to shew the Subject or those which set it in the liveliest and most agreeable Light These he never fails to dispose in the most advantagious Manners Situations and Oppositions  Next we find all his Figures differently  characterized  in their Expressions and Attitudes according to their several Natures The Gods for instance are distinguish'd in Air Habit and Proportion from Men in the fourth Picture Masters from Servants in the eighth and so of the rest  Nothing is more wonderful than his exact Observation of the  Contrast  not only between Figure and Figure but between Subject and Subject The City in Peace is a Contrast to the City in War Between the Siege in the fourth Picture and the Battel in the sixth a piece of Paisage is introduced and rural Scenes follow after The Country too is represented in War in the fifth as well as in Peace in the seventh eighth and ninth The very Animals are shewn in these two different States in the tenth and the eleventh Where the Subjects appear the same he contrastes them some other way Thus the first Picture of the Town in Peace having a predominant Air of Gaiety in the Dances and Pomps of the Marriage the second has a Character of Earnestness and Sollicitude in the Dispute and Pleadings In the Pieces of rural Life that of the Plowing is of a different Character from the Harvest and that of the Harvest from the Vintage In each of these there is a Contrast of the  Labour  and  Mirth  of the country People In the first some are plowing others taking a Cup of good Liquor in the next we see the Reapers working in one part and the Banquet prepar'd in another in the last the Labour of the Vineyard is reliev'd with Musick and a Dance The Persons are no less varied Old and Young Men and Women There being Women in two Pictures together namely the eighth and ninth it is remarkable that those in the latter are of a different Character from the former they who dress the Supper being ordinary Women the others who carry Baskets in the Vineyard young and beautiful Virgins And these again are of an inferior Character to those in the twelfth Piece who are distinguish'd as People of Condition by a more elegant Dress There are three Dances in the Buckler and these too are varied That at the Wedding is in a circular Figure that of the Vineyard in a Row that in the last Picture a mingled one Lastly there is a manifest Contrast in the Colours nay ev'n in the BackGrounds of the several Pieces For Example that of the Plowing is of a dark Tinct that of the Harvest yellow that of the Pasture green and the rest in like manner  That he was not a Stranger to Aerial  Perspective  appears in his expresly marking the Distance of Object from Object He tells us for instance that the two Spies lay a little remote from the other Figures and that the Oak under which was spread the Banquet of the Reapers stood apart What he says of the Valley sprinkled all over with Cottages and Flocks appears to be a Description of a large Country in Perspective And indeed a general Argument for this may be drawn from the Number of Figures on the Shield which could not be all express'd in their full Magnitude And this is therefore a sort of Proof that the Art of lessening them according to Perspective was known at that Time  What the Criticks call the  three Unities  ought in reason as much to be observed in a Picture as in a Play each should have only  one principal Action  one  Instant of Time  and one  Point of View  In this Method of Examination also the Shield of  Homer  will bear the Test He has been more exact than the greatest Painters who have often deviated from one or  other of these Rules whereas when we examine the detail of each Compartiment it will appear  First that there is but one principal Action in each Picture and that no supernumerary Figures or Actions are introduced This will answer all that has been said of the Confusion and Crowd of Figures on the Shield by those who never comprehended the Plan of it  Secondly that no Action is represented in one Peice which could not happen in the same Instant of Time This will overthrow the Objection against so many different Actions appearing in one Shield which in this Case is much as absurd as to object against so many of  Raphael  's Cartons appearing in one Gallery  Thirdly It will be manifest that there are no Objects in any one Picture which could not be seen in one Point of View Hereby the  Abbè Terasson  's whole Criticism will fall to the Ground which amounts but to this that the general Objects of the Heavens Stars and Sea with the particular Prospects of Towns Fields  c  could never be seen all at once  Homer  was incapable of so absurd a Thought nor could these heavenly Bodies had he intended them for a Picture have ever been seen together from one Point for the Constellations and the Full Moon for example could never be seen at once with the Sun But the celestial Bodies were placed on the Boss as the Ocean at the Margin of the Shield These were no Parts of the Painting but the former was only an Ornament to the Projection in the middle and the latter a Frame round about it In the same manner as the Divisions Projections or Angles of a Roof are left to be ornamented at the Discretion of the Painter with Foliage Architecture Grotesque or what he pleases However his Judgment will be still more commendable if he contrives to make even these extrinsical Parts to bear some Allusion to the main Design It is this which  Homer  has done in placing a sort of Sphere in the middle and the Ocean at the Border of a Work which was expressly intended to represent the Universe  I proceed now to the Detail of the Shield in which the Words of  Homer  being first translated an Attempt will be made to shew with what exact Order all that he describes may enter into the Composition according to the Rules of Painting  THE SHIELD of  ACHILLES  Divided into its several Parts  The  BOSS  of the  SHIELD  VERSE    c    Here  Vulcan  represented the Earth the Heaven the Sea the indefatigable Course of the Sun the Moon in her full all the celestial Signs that crown  Olympus  the  Pleiades  the  Hyades  the great  Orion  and the  Bear  commonly call'd the  Wain  the only Constellation which never bathing itself in the Ocean turns about the Pole and observes the Course of  Orion  The Sculpture of these resembled somewhat of our terrestrial and celestial Globes and took up the Center of the Shield 'Tis plain by the huddle in which  Homer  expresses this that he did not describe it as a Picture for a point of Sight  The Circumference is divided into twelve Compartiments each being a separate Picture As follow  First Compartiment  A Town in Peace    c    He engraved two Cities in one of them were represented Nuptials and Festivals The Spouses from their bridal Chambers were conducted thro' the Town by the Light of Torches Every Mouth sung the  Hymeneal  Song The Youths turn'd rapidly about in a circular Dance The Flute and the Lyre resounded The Women every one in the Street standing in the Porches beheld and admired  In this Picture the Brides preceded by Torchbearers are on the Foreground The Dance in Circles and Musicians behind them The Street in Perspective on either side the Women and Spectators in the Porches  c  dispers'd thro' all the Architecture  Second Compartiment  An Assembly of People    c    There was seen a Number of People in the Marketplace and two Men disputing warmly The Occasion was the Payment of a Fine for a Murder which one affirm'd before the People he had paid the other deny'd to have receiv'd both demanded that the Affair should be determined by the Judgment of an Arbiter The Acclamations of the Multitude favour'd sometimes the one Party sometimes the other  Here is a fine Plan for a Masterpiece of  Expression  any Judge of Painting will see our Author has chosen that  Cause  which of all others wou'd give occasion to the greatest Variety of expression The Father the Murderer the Witnesses and the different Passions of the Assembly would afford an ample Field for this Talent even to  Raphael  himself  Third Compartiment  The Senate    c    The Heralds rang'd the People in order The reverend Elders were seated on Seats of polish'd Stone in the sacred Circle they rose up and declared their Judgment each in his Turn with the Scepter in his Hand Two Talents of Gold were laid in the middle of the Circle to be given to him who should pronounce the most equitable Judgment  The Judges are seated in the Center of the Picture one who is the principal Figure standing up as speaking another in an Action of rising as in order to speak The Ground about 'em a Prospect of the  Forum  fill'd with Auditors and Spectators  Fourth Compartiment  A Town in War  c  The other City was besieged by two glittering Armies They were not agreed whether to sack the Town or divide all the Booty of it into two equal Parts to be shared between them Meantime the besieged secretly armed themselves for an Ambuscade Their Wives Children and old Men were posted to defend the Walls The Warriors march'd from the Town with  Pallas  and  Mars  at their Head The Deities were of Gold and had golden Armours by the Glory of which they were distinguish'd above the Men as well as by their superior Stature and more elegant Proportions  This Subject may be thus disposed The Town pretty near the Eye across the whole Picture with the old Men on the Walls The Chiefs of each Army on the Foreground Their different Opinions for putting the Town to the Sword or sparing it on account of the Booty may be express'd by some having their Hands on their Swords and looking up to the City others stopping them or in an Action of persuading against it Behind in Prospect the Townsmen may be seen going out from the back Gates with the two Deities at their Head  Homer  here gives a clear Instance of what the Ancients always practised the distinguishing the Gods and Goddesses by Characters of Majesty or Beauty somewhat superior to Nature we constantly find this in their Statues and to this the modern Masters owe the grand Taste in the Perfection of their Figures  Fifth Compartiment  An Ambuscade    c    Being arrived at the River where they design'd their Ambush the Place where the Cattel were water'd they dispos'd themselves along the Bank cover'd with their Arms Two Spies lay at a distance from them observing when the Oxen and Sheep should come to drink They came immediately followed by two Shepherds who were playing on their Pipes without any Apprehension of their Danger  This quiet Picture is a kind of  Repose  between the last and the following active Pieces Here is a Scene of a River and Trees under which lye the Soldiers next the Eye of the Spectator on the farther Bank are placed the two Spies on one Hand and the Flocks and Shepherds appear coming at a greater Distance on the other  Sixth Compartiment  The Battel    c    The People of the Town rush'd upon them carried off the Oxen and Sheep and kill'd the Shepherds The Besiegers sitting before the Town heard the Outcry and mounting their Horses arriv'd at the Bank of the River where they stopp'd and encounter'd each other with their Spears Discord Tumult and Fate rag'd in the midst of them There might you see cruel  Destiny  dragging a dead Soldier thro' the Battel two others she seiz'd alive one of which was mortally wounded the other not yet hurt The Garment on her Shoulders was stain'd with human Blood The Figures appear'd as if they lived moved and fought you would think they really dragged off their Dead  The Sheep and two Shepherds lying dead upon the Foreground A Battelpiece fills the Picture The Allegorical Figure of the  Parca  or  Destiny  is the Principal This had been a noble Occasion for such a Painter as  Rubens  who has with most Happiness and Learning imitated the Ancients in these fictitious and symbolical Persons  Seventh Compartiment  Tillage    The next Piece represented a large Field a deep and fruitful Soil which seem'd to have been three times plow'd the Labourers appear'd turning their Plows on every side As soon as they came to a Land's end a Man presented them a Bowl of Wine cheared with this they return'd and worked down a new furrow desirous to hasten to the next Land's end The Field was of Gold but look'd black  behind the Plows as if it had really been turn'd up the surprizing Effect of the Art of  Vulcan  The Plowmen must be represented on the Foreground in the Action of turning at the End of the Furrow The Invention of  Homer  is not content with barely putting down the Figures but enlivens them prodigiously with some remarkable Circumstance The giving a Cup of Wine to the Plowmen must occasion a fine Expression in the Faces  Eighth Compartiment  The Harvest    c    Next he represented a Field of Corn in which the Reapers worked with sharp Sickles in their Hands the Corn fell thick along the Furrows in equal Rows Three Binders were employed in making up the Sheaves The Boys attending them gather'd up the loose Swarths and carried them in their Arms to be bound The Lord of the Field standing in the midst of the Heaps with a Scepter in his Hand rejoyces in Silence His Officers at a Distance prepare a Feast under the Shade of an Oak and hold an Ox ready to be sacrificed while the Women mix the Flower of Wheat for the Reaper's Supper  The Reapers on the Foreground with their Faces towards the Spectators the Gatherers behind and the Children on the farther Ground The Master of the Field who is the chief Figure may be set in the middle of the Picture with a strong Light upon him in the Action of directing and pointing with his Scepter The Oak with the Servants under it the Sacrifice  c  on a distant Ground would altogether make a beautiful Grouppe of great Variety  Ninth Compartiment  The Vintage    c    He then engraved a Vineyard loaden with its Grapes The Vineyard was Gold but the Grapes black and the Props of them Silver A Trench of a dark Metal and a Palisade of Tin encompass'd the whole Vineyard  There was one Path in it by which the Labourers in the Vineyard pass'd Young Men and Maids carried the Fruit in woven Baskets In the middle of them a Youth play'd on the Lyre and charmed them with his tender Voice as he sung to the Strings  or  as he sung the Song of  Linus  The rest striking the Ground with their Feet in exact time follow'd him in a Dance and accompanied his Voice with their own  The Vintage scarce needs to be painted in any Colours but  Homer  's The Youths and Maids toward the Eye as coming out of the Vineyard The Enclosure Pales Gate  c  on the Foreground There is something inexpressibly  riant  in this Piece above all the rest  Tenth Compartiment  Animals    c    He graved a Herd of Oxen marching with their Heads erected These Oxen inlaid with Gold and Tin seem'd to bellow as they quitted their Stall and run in haste to the Meadows through which a rapid River roll'd with resounding Streams amongst the Rushes Four Herdsmen of Gold attended them follow'd by nine large Dogs Two terrible Lions seized a Bull by the Throat who roar'd as they dragg'd him along the Dogs and the Herdsmen ran to his Rescue but the Lions having torn the Bull devour'd his Entrails and drank his Blood the Herdsmen came up with their Dogs and hearten'd them in vain they durst not attack the Lions but standing at some Distance barked at them and shunn'd them  We have next a fine Piece of Animals tame and savage But what is remarkable is that these Animals are not coldly brought in to be gazed upon The Herds Dogs and Lions are put into Action enough to exercise the Warmth and Spirit of  Rubens  or the great Taste of  Julio Romano  The Lions may be next the Eye one holding the Bull by the Throat the other tearing out his Entrails A Herdsman or two heartening the Dogs All these on the Foreground On the second Ground another Grouppe of Oxen that seem to have been gone before tossing their Heads and running other Herdsmen and Dogs after 'em And beyond them a Prospect of the River  Eleventh Compartiment  Sheep    c  The divine Artist then engraved a large Flock of white Sheep feeding along a beautiful Valley Innumerable Folds Cottages and enclos'd Shelters were scatter'd thro' the Prospect  This is an entire Landscape without human Figures an Image of Nature solitary and undisturb'd The deepest Repose and Tranquillity is that which distinguishes it from the others  Twelfth Compartiment  The Dance    c    The skilful  Vulcan  then design'd the Figure and various Motions of a Dance like that which  Daedalus  of old contrived in  Gnossus  for the fair  Ariadne  There the young Men and Maidens danced Hand in Hand the Maids were dress'd in linen Garments the Men in rich and shining Stuffs The Maids had flowery Crowns on their Heads the Men had Swords of Gold hanging from their Sides in Belts of Silver Here they seem'd to run in a Ring with active Feet as swiftly as a Wheel runs round when tried by the Hand of the Potter There they appear'd to move in many Figures and sometimes to meet sometimes to wind from each other A Multitude of Spectators stood round delighted with the Dance In the middle two nimble Tumblers exercised themselves in Feats of Activity while the Song was carried on by the whole Circle  This Picture includes the greatest Number of Persons  Homer  himself has group'd them and marked the manner of the Composition This Piece would excel in the different  Airs of Beauty  which might be given to the young Men and Women and the graceful Attitudes in the various manners of Dancing On which account the Subject might be fit for  Guido  or perhaps cou'd be no where better executed than in our own Countrey  The BORDER of the SHIELD    c    Then laslly he represented the rapid Course of the great Ocean which he made to roll its Waves round the Extremity of the whole Circumference  This as has been said before was only the Frame to the  whole Shield and is therefore but slightly touch'd upon without any mention of particular Objects  I ought not to end this Essay without vindicating myself from the Vanity of treating of an Art which I love so much better than I understand But I have been very careful to consult both the best Performers and Judges in Painting I can't neglect this occasion of saying how happy I think myself in the Favour of the most distinguish'd Masters of that Art Sir  Godsrey Kneller  in particular allows me to tell the World that he entirely agrees with my Sentiments on this Subject And I can't help wishing that he who gives this Testimony to  Homer  would ennoble so great a Design by his own Execution of it  Vulcan  never wrought for  Thetis  with more Readiness and Affection than Sir  Godfrey  has done for me And so admirable a Picture of the whole Universe could not be a more agreeable Present than he has oblig'd me with in the Portraits of some of those Persons who are to me the dearest Objects in it  THE NINETEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Reconciliation of  Achilles  and  Agamemnon  THETIS  brings to her Son the Armour made by  Vulcan  She preserves the Body of his Friend from Corruption and commands him to assemble the Army to declare his Resentment at an end  Agamemnon  and  Achilles  are solemnly reconcil'd The Speeches Presents and Ceremonies on that Occasion  Achilles  is with great Difficulty persuaded to refrain from the Battel till the Troops have refresh'd themselves by the Advice of  Ulysses  The Presents are convey'd to the Tent of  Achilles  where  Briseis  laments over the Body of  Patroclus  The Hero obstinately refuses all repast and gives himself up to Lamentations for his Friend  Minerva  descends to strengthen him by the Order of  Jupiter  He arms for the Fight his Appearance described He addresses himself to his Horses and reproaches them with the Death of  Patroclus  One of them is miraculously endued with Voice and inspir'd to prophecy his Fate but the Hero not astonish'd by that Prodigy rushes with Fury to the Combate  The thirtieth Day The Scene is on the Seashore  THE NINETEENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  SOON as  Aurora  heav'd her orient Head  Above the Waves that blush'd with early Red  With newborn Day to gladden mortal Sight  And gild the Courts of Heav'n with sacred Light  Th'immortal Arms the GoddessMother bears  Swift to her Son Her Son she finds in Tears  Stretch'd o'er  Patroclus'  Corse while all the rest  Their Sov'reign's Sorrows in their own exprest  A Ray divine her heav'nly Presence shed  And thus his Hand softtouching  Thetis  said  Suppress my Son this Rage of Grief and know  It was not Man but Heav'n that gave the Blow  Behold what Arms by  Vulcan  are bestow'd  Arms worthy thee or fit to grace a God  Then drops the radiant Burden on the Ground  Clang the strong Arms and ring the Shores around  Back shrink the  Myrmidons  with dread Surprize  And from the broad Effulgence turn their Eyes  Unmov'd the Hero kindles at the Show  And feels with Rage divine his Bosom glow  From his fierce Eyeballs living Flames expire  And flash incessant like a Stream of Fire  He turns the radiant Gift and feeds his Mind  On all th'immortal Artist had design'd  Goddess he cry'd these glorious Arms that shine  With matchless Art confess the Hand divine  Now to the bloody Battel let me bend  But ah the Relicks of my slaughter'd Friend  In those wide Wounds thro' which his Spirit fled  Shall Flies and Worms obscene pollute the Dead  That unavailing Care be laid aside  The Azure Goddess to her Son reply'd  Whole Years untouch'd uninjur'd shall remain  Fresh as in Life the Carcase of the Slain  But go  Achilles  as Affairs require  Before the  Grecian  Peers renounce thine Ire  Then uncontroll'd in boundless War engage  And Heav'n with Strength supply the mighty Rage  Then in the Nostrils of the Slain she pour'd  Nectareous Drops and rich Ambrosia showr'd  O'er all the Corse The Flies forbid their Prey  Untouch'd it rests and sacred from Decay  Achilles  to the Strand obedient went  The Shores resounded with the Voice he sent  The Heroes heard and all the Naval Train  That tend the Ships or guide them o'er the Main  Alarm'd transported at the wellknown Sound  Frequent and full the great Assembly crown'd  Studious to see that Terror of the Plain  Long lost to Battel shine in Arms again  Tydides  and  Ulysses  first appear  Lame with their Wounds and leaning on the Spear  These on the sacred Seats of Council plac'd  The King of Men  Atrides  came the last  He too sore wounded by  Agenor  's Son  Achilles  rising in the midst begun  Oh Monarch better far had been the Fate  Of thee of me of all the  Grecian  State  If e'er the Day when by mad Passion sway'd  Rash we contended for the blackey'd Maid  Preventing  Dian  had dispatch'd her Dart  And shot the shining Mischief to the Heart  Then many a Hero had not press'd the Shore  Nor  Troy  's glad Fields been fatten'd with our Gore  Long long shall  Greece  the Woes we caus'd bewail  And sad Posterity repeat the Tale  But this no more the Subject of Debate  Is past forgotten and resign'd to Fate  Why should alas a mortal Man as I  Burn with a Fury that can never die  Here then my Anger ends Let War succeed  And ev'n as  Greece  has bled let  Ilion  bleed  Now call the Hosts and try if in our Sight  Troy  yet shall dare to camp a second Night  I deem their Mightiest when this Arm he knows  Shall 'scape with Transport and with Joy repose  He said His finish'd Wrath with loud Acclaim  The  Greeks  accept and shout  Pelides'  Name  When thus not rising from his lofty Throne  In State unmov'd the King of Men begun  Hear me ye Sons of  Greece  with Silence hear  And grant your Monarch an impartial Ear  Awhile your loud untimely Joy suspend  And let your rash injurious Clamours end  Unruly Murmurs or illtim'd Applause  Wrong the best Speaker and the justest Cause  Nor charge on me ye  Greeks  the dire Debate  Know angry  Jove  and allcompelling  Fate  With fell  Erynnis  urg'd my Wrath that Day  When from  Achilles'  Arms I forc'd the Prey  What then cou'd I against the Will of Heaven  Not by my self but vengeful  Ate  driv'n  She  Jove  's dread Daughter fated to infest  The Race of Mortals enter'd in my Breast  Not on the Ground that haughty Fury treads  But prints her lofty Footsteps on the Heads  Of mighty Men inflicting as she goes  Longfest'ring Wounds inextricable Woes  Of old she stalk'd amid the bright Abodes  And  Jove  himself the Sire of Men and Gods  The World's great Ruler felt her venom'd Dart  Deceiv'd by  Juno  's Wiles and female Art  For when  Alcmena  's nine long Months were run  And  Jove  expected his immortal Son  To Gods and Goddesses th'unruly Joy  He show'd and vaunted of his matchless Boy  From us he said this Day an Infant springs  Fated to rule and born a King of Kings  Saturnia  ask'd an Oath to vouch the Truth  And fix Dominion on the favour'd Youth  The Thund'rer unsuspicious of the Fraud  Pronounc'd those solemn Words that bind a God  The joyful Goddess from  Olympus'  Height  Swift to  Achaian Argos  bent her Flight  Scarce sev'n Moons gone lay  Sthenelus  his Wife  She push'd her ling'ring Infant into Life  Her Charms  Alcmena  's coming Labours stay  And stop the Babe just issuing to the Day  Then bids  Saturnius  bear his Oath in mind  A Youth said she of  Jove  's immortal Kind  Is this Day born From  Sthenelus  he springs  And claims thy Promise to be King of Kings  Grief seiz'd the Thund'rer by his Oath engag'd  Stung to the Soul he sorrow'd and he rag'd  From his Ambrosial Head where perch'd she sate  He snatch'd the FuryGoddess of Debate  The dread th'irrevocable Oath he swore  Th'immortal Seats should ne'er behold her more  And whirl'd her headlong down for ever driv'n  From bright  Olympus  and the starry Heav'n  Thence on the nether World the Fury fell  Ordain'd with Man's contentious Race to dwell  Full oft' the God his Son's hard Toils bemoan'd  Curs'd the dire Fury and in secret groan'd  Ev'n thus like  Jove  himself was I misled  While raging  Hector  heap'd our Camps with Dead  What can the Errors of my Rage attone  My martial Troops my Treasures are thy own  This Instant from the Navy shall be sent  Whate'er  Ulysses  promis'd at thy Tent  But thou appeas'd propitious to our Pray'r  Resume thy Arms and shine again in War  O King of Nations whose superiour Sway  Returns  Achilles  all our Hosts obey  To keep or send the Presents be thy Care  To us 'tis equal All we ask is War  While yet we talk or but an instant shun  The Fight our glorious Work remains undone  Let ev'ry  Greek  who sees my Spear confound  The  Trojan  Ranks and deal Destruction round  With Emulation what I act survey  And learn from thence the Business of the Day  The Son of  Peleus  thus And thus replies  The great in Councils  Ithacus  the Wise  Tho' godlike Thou art by no Toils opprest  At least our Armies claim Repast and Rest  Long and laborious must the Combate be  When by the Gods inspir'd and led by thee  Strength is deriv'd from Spirits and from Blood  And those augment by gen'rous Wine and Food  What boastful Son of War without that Stay  Can last a Hero thro' a single Day  Courage may prompt but ebbing out his Strength  Mere unsupported Man must yield at length  Shrunk with dry Famine and with Toils declin'd  The dropping Body will desert the Mind  But built a new with Strengthconferring Fare  With Limbs and Soul untam'd he tires a War  Dismiss the People then and give command  With strong Repast to hearten ev'ry Band  But let the Presents to  Achilles  made  In full Assembly of all  Greece  be laid  The King of Men shall rise in publick Sight  And solemn swear observant of the Rite  That spotless as she came the Maid removes  Pure from his Arms and guiltless of his Loves  That done a sumptuous Banquet shall be made  And the full Price of injur'd Honour paid  Stretch not

Nor great  Achilles  grudge this short Delay  Till from the Fleet our Presents be convey'd  And  Jove  attesting the firm Compact made  A Train of noble Youth the Charge shall bear  These to select  Ulysses  be thy Care  In order rank'd let all our Gifts appear  And the fair Train of Captives close the Rear  Talthybius  shall the Victim Boar convey  Sacred to  Jove  and yon' bright Orb of Day

the Sky  All grim with gaping Wounds our Heroes lye  Those call to War and might my Voice incite  Now now this Instant shou'd commence the Fight  Then when the Days' complete let gen'rous Bowls  And copious Banquets glad your weary Souls  Let not my Palate know the Taste of Food  Till my insatiate Rage be cloy'd with Blood  Pale lyes my Friend with Wounds disfigur'd o'er  And his cold Feet are

of  Greeks    Ulysses  thus rejoin'd  The best and bravest of the WarriorKind  Thy Praise it is in dreadful Camps to shine  But old Experience and calm Wisdom mine  Then hear my Counsel and to Reason yield  The bravest soon are satiate of the Field  Tho' vast the Heaps that strow the crimson Plain  The bloody Harvest brings but little Gain  The Scale of Conquest ever wav'ring lies  Great  Jove  but turns it and the Victor dies  The Great the Bold by Thousands daily fall  And endless were the Grief to weep for all  Eternal Sorrows what avails to shed  Greece  honours not with solemn Fasts the Dead  Enough when Death demands the Brave to pay  The Tribute of a melancholy Day  One Chief with Patience to the Grave resign'd  Our Care devolves on others left behind  Let gen'rous Food Supplies of Strength produce  Let rising Spirits flow from sprightly Juice  Let their warm Heads with Scenes of Battle glow  And pour new Furies on the feebler Foe  Yet a short Interval and none shall dare  Expect a second Summons to the War  Who waits for that the dire Effect shall find  If trembling in the Ships he lags behind  Embodied to the Battel let us bend  And all at once on haughty  Troy

Creiontian  Strain  And  Melanippus  form'd the chosen Train  Swift as the Word was giv'n the Youths obey'd  Twice ten bright Vases in the midst they laid  A Rowe of six fair Tripods then succeeds

the golden Talents bore  The rest in publick View the Chiefs dispose  A splendid Scene Then  Agamemnon  rose  The Boar  Talthybius  held The  Grecian  Lord  Drew the broad Cutlace sheath'd beside his Sword  The stubborn Bristles from the Victim's Brow  He crops and off'ring meditates his Vow  His Hands uplifted to th'attesting Skies  On Heav'ns broad marble Roof were fix'd his Eyes  The solemn Words a deep Attention draw  And  Greece  around sate thrill'd with sacred Awe  Witness thou First thou greatest Pow'r above  All good allwise and allsurveying  Jove  And Mother Earth and Heav'ns revolving Light  And ye fell Furies of the Realms of Night  Who rule the Dead and horrid Woes prepare  For perjur'd Kings and all who falsely swear  The blackey'd Maid inviolate removes  Pure and unconscious of my manly Loves  If this be false Heav'n all its Vengeance shed  And level'd Thunder strike my guilty Head  With that his Weapon deep inflicts the Wound  The bleeding Savage tumbles to the Ground  The sacred Herald rolls the Victim slain  A Feast for Fish into the foaming Main  Then thus  Achilles  Hear ye  Greeks  and know  Whate'er we feel 'tis  Jove  inflicts the Woe  Not else  Atrides  could our Rage inflame  Nor from my Arms unwilling force the Dame  'Twas  Jove  's high Will alone o'eruling all  That doom'd our Strife and doom'd the  Greeks  to fall  Go then ye Chiefs indulge the genial Rite  Achilles  waits ye and expects the Fight  The speedy Council at his Word adjourn'd  To their black Vessels all the  Greeks  return'd  Achilles  sought his Tent His Train before  March'd onward bending with the Gifts they bore  Those in the Tents the Squires industrious spread  The foaming Coursers to the Stalls they led  To their new Seats the Female Captives move  Briseis  radiant as the Queen of Love  Slow as she past beheld with sad survey  Where gash'd with cruel Wounds  Patroclus  lay  Prone on the Body fell the heav'nly Fair  Beat her sad Breast and tore her golden Hair  Allbeautiful in Grief her humid Eyes  Shining with Tears she lifts and thus she cries  Ah Youth for ever dear for ever kind  Once tender Friend of my distracted Mind  I left thee fresh in Life in Beauty gay  Now find thee cold inanimated Clay  What Woes my wretched Race of Life attend  Sorrows on Sorrows never doom'd to end  The first lov'd Consort of my virgin Bed  Before these Eyes in fatal Battel bled  My three brave Brothers in one mournful Day  All trod the dark irremeable Way  Thy friendly Hand uprear'd me from the Plain  And dry'd my Sorrows for a Husband slain  Achilles'  Care you promis'd I shou'd prove  The first the dearest Partner of his Love  That Rites divine should ratify the Band  And make me Empress in his native Land  Accept these grateful Tears For thee they flow  For thee that ever felt another's Woe  Her Sister Captives echo'd Groan for Groan  Nor mourn'd  Patroclus'  Fortunes but their own  The Leaders press'd the Chief on ev'ry side  Unmov'd he heard them and with Sighs deny'd  If yet  Achilles  have a Friend whose Care  Is bent to please him this Request forbear  Till yonder Sun descend ah let me pay  To Grief and Anguish one abstemious Day  He spoke and from the Warriors turn'd his Face  Yet still the BrotherKings of  Atreus'  Race  Nestor Idomeneus Ulysses  sage  And  Phoenix  strive to calm his Grief and Rage  His Rage they calm not nor his Grief controul  He groans he raves he sorrows from his Soul  Thou too  Patroclus  thus his Heart he vents  Hast spread th'inviting Banquet in our Tents  Thy sweet Society thy winning Care  Oft' stay'd  Achilles  rushing to the War  But now alas to Death's cold Arms resign'd  What Banquet but Revenge can glad my Mind  What greater Sorrow could afflict my Breast  What more if hoary  Peleus  were deceast  Who now perhaps in  Pthia  dreads to hear  His Son's sad Fate and drops a tender Tear  What more should  Neoptolemus  the brave  My only Offspring sink into the Grave  If yet that Offspring lives I distant far  Of all neglectful wage a hateful War  I cou'd not this this cruel Stroke attend  Fate claim'd  Achilles  but might spare his Friend  I hop'd  Patroclus  might survive to rear  My tender Orphan with a Parent's Care  From  Scyros  Isle conduct him o'er the Main  And glad his Eyes with his paternal Reign  The lofty Palace and the large Domain  For  Peleus  breaths no more the vital Air  Or drags a wretched Life of Age and Care  But till the News of my sad Fate invades  His hastening Soul and sinks him to the Shades  Sighing he said His Grief the Heroes join'd  Each stole a Tear for what he left behind  Their mingled Grief the Sire of Heav'n survey'd  And thus with Pity to his blueey'd Maid  Is then  Achilles  now no more thy Care  And dost thou thus desert the Great in War  Lo where yon' Sails their canvas Wings extend  All comfortless he sits and wails his Friend  E'er Thirst and Want his Forces have opprest  Haste and infuse Ambrosia in his Breast  He spoke and sudden as the Word of  Jove  Shot the descending Goddess from above  So swift thro' Aether the shrill  Harpye  sings  The wide Air floating to her ample Wings  To great  Achilles  she her Flight addrest  And pour'd divine Ambrosia in his Breast  With Nectar sweet Refection of the God's  Then swift ascending sought the bright Abodes  Now issued from the Ships the warrior Train  And like a Deluge pour'd upon the Plain  As when the piercing Blasts of  Boreas  blow  And scatter o'er the Fields the driving Snow  From dusky Clouds the fleecy Winter flies  Whose dazling Lustre whitens all the Skies  So Helms succeeding Helms so Shields from Shields  Catch the quick Beams and brighten all the Fields  Broadglitt'ring Breastplates Spears with pointed Rays  Mix in one Stream reflecting Blaze on Blaze  Thick beats the Center as the Coursers bound  With Splendor flame the Skies and laugh the Fields around  Full in the midst high tow'ring o'er the rest  His Limbs in Arms divine  Achilles  drest  Arms which the Father of the Fire bestow'd  Forg'd on th'Eternal Anvils of the God  Grief and Revenge his furious Heart inspire  His glowing Eyeballs roll with living Fire  He grinds his Teeth and furious with Delay  O'erlooks th'embattled Host and hopes the bloody Day  The silver Cuishes first his Thighs infold  Then o'er his Breast was brac'd the hollow Gold  The brazen Sword a various Baldrick ty'd  That starr'd with Gems hung glitt'ring at his side  And like the Moon the broad refulgent Shield  Blaz'd with long Rays and gleam'd athwart the Field  So to Nightwand'ring Sailors pale with Fears  Wide o'er the wat'ry Waste a Light appears  Which on the farseen Mountain blazing high  Streams from some lonely Watchtow'r to the Sky  With mournful Eyes they gaze and gaze again  Loud howls the Storm and drives them o'er the Main  Next his high Head the Helmet grac'd behind  The sweepy Crest hung floating in the Wind  Like the red Star that from his flaming Hair  Shakes down Diseases Pestilence and War  So stream'd the golden Honours from his Head  Trembled the sparkling Plumes and the loose Glories shed  The Chief beholds himself with wond'ring eyes  His Arms he poises and his Motions tries  Buoy'd by some inward Force he seems to swim  And feels a Pinion lifting ev'ry Limb  And now he shakes his great paternal Spear  Pond'rous and huge which not a  Greek  could rear  From  Pelion  's cloudy Top an Ash entire  Old  Chiron  fell'd and shap'd it for his Sire  A Spear which stern  Achilles  only wields  The Death of Heroes and the Dread of Fields  Automedon  and  Alcimus  prepare  Th'immortal Coursers and the radiant Car  The silver Traces sweeping at their side  Their fiery Mouths resplendent Bridles ty'd  The Iv'ry studded Reins return'd behind  Wav'd o'er their Backs and to the Chariot join'd  The Charioteer then whirl'd the Lash around  And swift ascended at one active Bound  All bright in heav'nly Arms above his Squire  Achilles  mounts and sets the Field on Fire  Not brighter  Phoebus  in th'Aethereal Way  Flames from his Chariot and restores the Day  High o'er the Host all terrible he stands  And thunders to his Steeds these dread Commands  Xanthus  and  Balius  of  Podarges'  Strain  Unless ye boast that heav'nly Race in vain  Be swift be mindful of the Load ye bear  And learn to make your Master more your Care  Thro' falling Squadrons bear my slaught'ring Sword  Nor as ye left  Patroclus  leave your Lord  The gen'rous  Xanthus  as the Words he said  Seem'd sensible of Woe and droop'd his Head  Trembling he stood before the golden Wain  And bow'd to Dust the Honours of his Mane  When strange to tell So  Juno  will'd he broke  Eternal Silence and portentous spoke  Achilles  yes this Day at least we bear  Thy rage in safety thro' the Files of War  But come it will the fatal Time must come  Nor ours the Fault but God decrees thy Doom  Not thro' our Crime or Slowness in the Course  Fell thy  Patroclus  but by heav'nly Force  The bright farshooting God who gilds the Day  Confest we saw him tore his Arms away  Nocould our Swiftness o'er the Winds prevail  Or beat the Pinions of the Western Gale  All were in vainThe Fates thy Death demand  Due to a mortal and immortal Hand  Then ceas'd for ever by the  Furies  ty'd  His fateful Voice Th'intrepid Chief reply'd  With unabated RageSo let it be  Portents and Prodigies are lost on me  I know my Fates To die to see no more  My much lov'd Parents and my native Shore  EnoughWhen Heav'n ordains I sink in Night  Now perish  Troy  He said and rush'd to Fight  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Nineteenth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE NINETEENTH BOOK  I  VERSE  BEhold what Arms  c  'Tis not Poetry only which has had this Idea of giving divine Ams to a Hero we have a very remarkable Example of it in our holy Books In the second of  Maccabees  chap  Judas  sees in a Dream the Prophet  Jeremiah  bringing to him a Sword as from God Tho' this was only a Dream or a Vision yet still it is the same Idea This Example is likewise so much the more worthy of Observation as it is much later than the Age of  Homer  and as thereby it is seen that the same way of Thinking continued a long time amongst the Oriental Nations  Dacier  II  VERSE  Shall Flies and Worms obscene pollute the Dead    The Care which  Achilles  takes in this place to drive away the Flies from the dead Body of  Patroclus  seems to us a mean Employment and a Care unworthy of a Hero But that Office was regarded by  Homer  and by all the  Greeks  of his time as a pious Duty consecrated by Custom and Religion which obliged the Kindred and Friends of the  Deceas'd to watch his Corps and prevent any Corruption before the solemn Day of his Funerals It is plain this Devoir was thought an indispensable one since  Achilles  could not discharge himself of it but by imposing it upon his Mother It is also clear that in those times the Preservation of a dead Body was accounted a very important Matter since the Goddesses themselves nay the most delicate of the Goddesses made it the Subject of their utmost Attention As  Thetis  preserves the Body of  Patroclus  and chases from it those Insects that breed in the Wounds and cause Putrefaction so  Venus  is employ'd Day and Night about that of  Hector  in driving away the Dogs to which  Achilles  had expos'd it  Apollo  on his part covers it with a thick Cloud and preserves its Freshness amidst the greatest Heats of the Sun And this Care of the Deities over the Dead was look'd upon by Men as a Fruit of their Piety  There is an excellent Remark upon this Passage in  Bossu  's admirable Treatise of the Epic Poem lib c  "To speak says this Author of the Arts and Sciences as a Poet ought we should veil them under Names and Actions of Persons fictitious and allegorical  Homer  will not plainly say that Salt has the Virtue to preserve dead Bodies and prevent the Flies from engendering Worms in them he will not say that the Sea presented  Achilles  a Remedy to preserve  Patroclus  from Putrefaction but he will make the Sea a Goddess and tell us that  Thetis  to comfort  Achilles  engaged to perfume the Body with an Ambrosia which shou'd keep it a whole Year from Corruption It is thus  Homer  teaches the Poets to speak of Arts and Sciences This Example shews the Nature of the things that Flies cause Putrefaction that Salt preserves Bodies from it but all this is told us poetically the whole is reduced into Action the Sea is made a Person who speaks and acts and this  Prosopopoeia  is accompanied with Passion Tenderness and Affection in a word there is nothing which is not according to  Aristotle  's Precept endued with Manners  III  VERSE  Preventing  Dian  had dispatch'd her Dart  And shot the shining Mischief to the Heart    Achilles  wishes  Briseis  had died before she had occasion'd so great Calamities to his Countreymen I will not say to excuse him that his Virtue here overpowers his Love but that the Wish is not so very barbarous as it may seem by the Phrase to a modern Reader It is not that  Diana  had actually kill'd her as by a particular Stroke or Judgment from Heaven it means no more than a natural Death as appears from this Passage in  Odyss    When Age or Sickness have unnerv'd the Strong  Apollo  comes and  Cynthia  comes along  They bend the Silver Bows for sudden Ill  And every shining Arrow flies to kill  And he does not wish her Death now after she had been his Mistress but only that she had died before he knew or lov'd her  IV  VERSE  She  Jove  's dread daughter    This Speech of  Agamemnon  consisting of little else than the long Story of  Jupiter  's casting  Discord  out of Heaven seems odd enough at first sight and does not indeed answer what I believe every Reader expects at the Conference of these two Princes Without excusing it from the Justness and proper Application of the Allegory in the present Case I think it a piece of Artifice very agreeable to the Character of  Agamemnon  which is a Mixture of Haughtiness and Cunning He cannot prevail with himself any way to lessen the Dignity of the royal Character of which he every where appears jealous Something he is oblig'd to say in publick and not brooking directly to own himself in the wrong he slurs it over with this Tale With what Stateliness is it that he yields  "I was misled  says he but I was misled like  Jupiter  We invest you with our Powers take our Troops and our Treasures Our royal Promise shall be fulfill'd but be you pacified"  V  VERSE  She  Jove  's dread Daughter fated to infest  The Race of Mortals    It appears from hence that the Ancients own'd a  Daemon  created by God himself and totally taken up in doing Mischief  This Fiction is very remarkable in as much as it proves that the  Pagans  knew that a Daemon of Discord and Malediction was in Heaven and afterwards precipitated to Earth which perfectly agrees with holy History St  Justin  will have it that  Homer  attain'd to the Knowledge thereof in  Egypt  and that he had ev'n read what  Isaiah  writes chap  How art thou fal'n from Heaven O  Lucifer  Son of the Morning how art thou cut down to the Ground which didst weaken the Nations  But our Poet could not have seen the Prophecy of  Isaiah  because he liv'd or Years before that Prophet and this Anteriority of Time makes this Passage the more observable  Homer  therein bears authentick Witness to the Truth of the Story of an Angel thrown from Heaven and gives this Testimony above an Years before one of the greatest Prophets spoke of it  Dacier  VI  VERSE  To keep or send the Presents be thy Care    Achilles  neither refuses nor demands  Agamemnon  's Presents The first would be too contemptuous and the other would look too selfish It wou'd seem as if  Achilles  fought only for Pay like a Mercenary which wou'd be utterly unbecoming a Hero and dishonourable to that Character  Homer  is wonderful as to the Manners  Spond Dac  VII  VERSE  The stern  Aeacides  replies    The  Greek  Verse is  Which is repeated very frequently throughout the Iliad It is a very just Remark of a  French  Critick that what makes it so much taken notice of is the rumbling Sound and Length of the Word  This is so true that if in a Poem or Romance of the same Length as the Iliad we should repeat  The Hero answer'd  full as often we should never be sensible of that Repetition And if we are not shock'd at the like Frequency of those Expressions in the Aeneid  sic ore refert talia voce resert talia dicta dabat vix ea fatus erat  c it is only because the Sound of the  Latin  Words does not fill the Ear like that of the  Greek    The Discourse of the same Critick upon these sort of Repetitions in general deserves to be transcribed That useless Nicety says he of avoiding every Repetition which the Delicacy of later Times has introduced was not known to the first Ages of Antiquity The Books of  Moses  abound with them Far from condemning their frequent Use in the most ancient of all the Poets we should look upon them as the certain Character of the Age in which he liv'd They spoke so in his Time and to have spoken otherwise had been a Fault And indeed nothing is in itself so contrary to the true Sublime as that painful and frivolous Exactness with which we avoid to make use of a proper Word because it was us'd before It is certain that the  Romans  were less scrupulous as to this point You have often in a single Page of  Tully  the same Word five or six times over If it were really a Fault it is not to be conceiv'd how an Author who so little wanted Variety of Expressions as  Homer  could be so very negligent herein On the contrary he seems to have affected to repeat the same Things in the same Words on many Occasions  It was from two Principles equally true that among several People and in several Ages two Practices entirely different took their Rise  Moses Homer  and the Writers of the first Times had found that Repetitions of the same Words recall'd the Ideas of Things imprinted them much more strongly and render'd the Discourse more intelligible Upon this Principle the Custom of repeating Words Phrases and even entire Speeches insensibly establish'd itself both in Prose and in Poetry especially in Narrations  The Writers who succeeded them observ'd even from  Homer  himself that the greatest Beauty of Style consisted in Variety This they made their Principle They therefore avoided Repetitions of Words and still more of whole Sentences they endeavour'd to vary their Transitions and found out new Turns and Manners of expressing the same Things  Either of these Practices is good but the Excess of either vicious We should neither on the one hand thro' a Love of Simplicity and Clearness continually repeat the same Words Phrases or Discourses nor on the other for the Pleasure of Variety fall into a childish Affectation of expressing every thing twenty different Ways tho' it be never so natural and common  Nothing so much cools the Warmth of a Piece or puts out the Fire of Poetry as that perpetual Care to vary incessantly even in the smallest Circumstances In this as in many other Points  Homer  has despis'd the ungrateful Labour of too scrupulous a Nicety He has done like a great Painter who does not think himself oblig'd to vary all his Pieces to that degree as not one of 'em shall have the least Resemblance to another If the principal Figures are entirely different we easily excuse a Resemblance in the Landscapes the Skies or the Draperies Suppose a Gallery full of Pictures each of which represents a particular Subject In one I see  Achilles  in Fury menacing  Agamemnon  in another the same Hero with regret delivers up  Briseis  to the Heralds in a third 'tis still  Achilles  but  Achilles  overcome with Grief and lamenting to his Mother If the Air the Gesture the Countenance the Character of  Achilles  are the same in each of  these three Pieces if the Ground of one of these be the same with that of the others in the Composition and general Design whether it be Landscape or Architecture then indeed one should have reason to blame the Painter for the Uniformity of his Figures and Grounds But if there be no Sameness but in the Folds of a few Draperies in the Structure of some part of a Building or in the Figure of some Tree Mountain or Cloud it is what no one would regard as a Fault The Application is obvious  Homer  repeats but they are not the great Strokes which he repeats not those which strike and fix our Attention They are only the little Parts the Transitions the general Circumstances or familiar Images which recur naturally and upon which the Reader but casts his Eye carelesly Such as the Descriptions of Sacrifices Repasts or Embarquements such in short as are in their own Nature much the same which it is sufficient just to shew and which are in a manner incapable of different Ornaments  VIII  VERSE  Strength is deriv'd from Spirits  c  This Advice of  Ulysses  that the Troops shou'd refresh themselves with Eating and Drinking was extremely necessary after a Battel of so long Continuance as that of the Day before And  Achilles  's Desire that they shou'd charge the Enemy immediately without any Reflection on the Necessity of that Refreshment was also highly natural to his violent Character This forces  Ulysses  to repeat that Advice and insist upon it so much Which these Criticks did not see into who thro' a false Delicacy are shock'd at his insisting so warmly on Eating and Drinking Indeed to a common Reader who is more fond of heroick and romantick than of just and natural Images this at first sight may have an Air of Ridicule but I'll venture to say there is nothing ridiculous in the Thing itself nor mean and low in  Homer  's manner of expressing it And I believe the same of this Translation tho' I have not soften'd or abated of the Idea they are so offended with  IX  VERSE  Pale lies my Friend  c  It is in the  Greek lies extended in my Tent with his Face turned towards the Door  that is to say as the Scholiast has explain'd it  having his Feet turned towards the Door  For it was thus the  Greeks  placed their Dead in the Porches of their Houses as likewise in  Italy  In portam rigidos calces extendit  Persius  Recepitque ad limina gressum  Corpus ubi exanimi positum Pallantis Acetes  Servabat Senior  Thus we are told by  Suetonius  of the Body of  AugustusEquester ordo suscepit urbique intulit atque in Vestibulo domus collocavit  X  VERSE  Tho' vast the Heaps  c  Ulysses  's Expression in the Original is very remarkable he calls    Straw  or  Chaff  such as are kill'd in the Battel and he calls  the  Crop  such as make their Escape This is very conformable to the Language of Holy Scripture wherein those who perish are called  Chaff  and those who are saved are call'd  Corn Dacier  XI  VERSE  None shall dare  Expect a second Summons to the War    This is very artful  Ulysses  to prevail upon  Achilles  to let the Troops take Repast and yet in some sort to second his impatience gives with the same Breath Orders for Battel by commanding the Troops to march and expect no farther Orders Thus tho' the Troops go to take Repast it looks as if they do not lose a moment's time but are going to put themselves in Array of Battel  Dacier  XII  VERSE  Rolls the Victim into the Main    For it was not lawful to eat the Flesh of the Victims that were sacrificed in Confirmation of Oaths such were Victims of Malediction  Eustathius  XIII  VERSE  Hear ye  Greeks c  Achilles  to let them see that he is entirely appeas'd justifies  Agamemnon  himself and enters into the Reasons with which that Prince had colour'd his Fault But in that Justification he perfectly well preserves his Character and illustrates the Advantage he has over that King who offended him  Dacier  XIV  VERSE  c The Lamentation of  Briseis  over  Patroclus  This Speech says  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  is not without its Artifice While  Briseis  seems only to be deploring  Patroclus  she represents to  Achilles  who stands by the Breach of the Promises he had made her and upbraids him with the Neglect he had been guilty of in resigning her up to  Agamemnon  He adds that  Achilles  hereupon acknowledges the Justice of her Complaint and makes answer that his Promises should be performed It was a slip in that great Critick's Memory for the Verse he cites is not in this Part of the Author  Part  XV  VERSE Achilles  Care you promis'd  c  In these Days when our Manners are so different from those of the Ancients and we see none of those dismal Catastrophes which laid whole Kingdoms waste and subjected Princesses  and Queens to the Power of the Conqueror it will perhaps seem astonishing that a Princess of  Briseis  's Birth the very Day that her Father Brothers and Husband were kill'd by  Achilles  should suffer her self to be comforted and even flatter'd with the Hopes of becoming the Spouse of their Murderer But such were the Manners of those Times as ancient History testifies And a Poet represents them as they were But if there was a Necessary for justifying them it might be said that Slavery was at that time so terrible that in truth a Princess like  Briseis  was pardonable to chuse rather to become  Achilles  's Wife than his Slave  Dacier  XVI  VERSE  Nor mourn'd  Patroclus  Fortunes but their own    Homer  adds this Touch to heighten the Character of  Briseis  and to shew the Difference there was between her and the other Captives  Briseis  as a wellborn Princess really bewail'd  Patroclus  out of  Gratitude  but the others by pretending to bewail him wept only out of  Interest Dacier  XVII  VERSE  Thou too  Patroclus c  This Lamentation is finely introduced While the Generals are persuading him to take some Refreshment it naturally awakens in his Mind the Remembrance of  Patroclus  who had so often brought him Food every Morning before they went to Battel This is very natural and admirably well conceals the Art of drawing the Subject of his Discourse from the things that present themselves  Spondanus  XVIII  VERSE  I hop'd  Patroclus  might survive  c  Patroclu  was young and  Achilles  who had but a short time to lives  hoped that after his Death his dear Friend wou'd be as a Father to his Son and put him into the Possession of his Kingdom  Neoptolemus  wou'd in  Patroclus  find  Peleus  and  Achilles  whereas when  Patroclus  was dead he must be an Orphan indeed  Homer  is particularly admirable for the Sentiments and always follows Nature  Dacier  XIX  VERSE  So Helms succeeding Helms so Shields from Shields  Catch the quick Beams and brighten all the Fields    It is probable the Reader may think the Words  shining splendid  and others deriv'd from the Lustre of Arms too frequent in these Books My Author is to answer for it but it may be alledg'd in his Excuse that when it was the Custom for every Soldier to serve in Armour and when those Arms were of Brass before the Use of Iron became common these Image of Lustre were less avoidable and more necessarily frequent in Descriptions of this nature  XX  VERSE  Achilles arming himself  c  There is a wonderful Pomp in this Description of  Achilles  's arming himself every Reader without being pointed to it will see the extreme Grandeur of all these Images But what is particular is in what a noble Scale they rise one above another and how the Hero is set still in a stronger Point of Light than before till he is at last in a manner cover'd over with Glories He is at first likened to the Moonlight then to the Flames of a Beacon then to a Comet and lastly to the Sun it self  XXI  VERSE  Then strange to tell so  Juno  will'd he broke  Eternal Silence and portentous spoke    It is remark'd in excuse of this extravagant Fiction of a Horse  speaking that  Homer  was authorized herein by Fable Tradition and History  Livy  makes mention of two Oxen that spoke on different occasions and recites the Speech of one which was  Roma cave tibi Pliny  tells us these Animals were particularly gifted this way l c  Est frequens in prodigiis priscorum bovem locutum  Besides  Homer  had prepar'd us for expecting something miraculous from these Horses of  Achilles  by representing them to be immortal We have seen 'em already sensible and weeping at the Death of  Patroclus  And we must add to all this that a Goddess is concern'd in working this Wonder It is  Juno  that does it  Oppian  alludes to this in a beautiful Passage of his first Book Not having the Original by me I shall quote what I believe is no less beautiful Mr  Fenton  's Translation of it  Of all the prone Creation none display  A friendlier Sense of Man's superior Sway  Some in the silent Pomp of Grief complain  For the brave Chief by doom of Battel slain  And when young  Peleus  in his rapid Car  Rush'd on to rouze the Thunder of the War  With human Voice inspir'd his Steed deplor'd  The Fate impending dreadful o'er his Lord  Cyneg lib  Spondanus  and  Dacier  fail not to bring up  Balaam  's Ass on this Occasion But methinks the Commentators are at too much pains to discharge the Poet from the Imputation of extravagant Fiction by accounting for Wonders of this kind I am afraid that next to the Extravagance of inventing them is that of endeavouring to reconcile such Fictions to Probability Would not one general Answer do better to say once for all that the abovecited Authors liv'd in the  Age of Wonders  The Taste of the World has been generally turn'd to the Miraculous Wonders were what the People would have and what not only the Poets but the Priests gave 'em  XXII  VERSE  Then ceas'd for ever by

Assum'd his Throne amid the bright Abodes  And question'd thus the Sire of Men and Gods  What moves the God who Heav'n and Earth commands  And grasps the Thunder in his awful Hands  Thus to convene

While great  Achilles  Terror of the Plain  Long lost to Battel shone in Arms again  Dreadful he stood in Front of all his Host  Pale  Troy  beheld and seem'd already lost  Her bravest Heroes pant with inward Fear  And trembling see another God of War  But when the Pow'rs descending swell'd the Fight  Then Tumult rose fierce Rage and pale Affright  Vary'd each Face then Discord sounds Alarms  Earth echoes and the Nations rush to Arms  Now thro' the trembling Shores  Minerva  calls  And now she thunders from the  Grecian  Walls  Mars  hov'ring o'er his  Troy  his Terror shrouds  In gloomy Tempests and a Night of Clouds  Now thro' each  Trojan  Heart he Fury pours  With Voice divine from  Ilion  's topmost Towr's  Now shouts to  Simois  from her beauteous * Hill  The Mountain shook the rapid Stream stood still  Above the Sire of Gods his Thunder rolls  And Peals on Peals redoubled rend the Poles  Beneath stern  Neptune  shakes the solid Ground  The Forests wave the Mountains nod around  Thro' all their Summits tremble  Ida  's Woods  And from their Sources boil her hundred Floods  Troy  's Turrets totter on the rocking Plain  And the toss'd Navies beat the heaving Main  Deep in the dismal Regions of the Dead  Th'infernal Monarch rear'd his horrid Head  Leap'd from his Throne lest  Neptunes  Arm should lay  His dark Dominions open to the Day  And pour in Light on  Pluto  's drear Abodes  Abhorr'd by Men and dreadful ev'n to Gods  Such War th'Immortals wage Such Horrors rend  The World's vast Concave when the Gods contend  First silvershafted  Phoebus  took the Plain  Against blue  Neptune  Monarch of the Main  The God of Arms his Giant Bulk display'd  Oppos'd to  Pallas  War's triumphant Maid  Against  Latona  march'd the Son of  May  The quiver'd  Dian  Sister of

turn'd  His Eyes around for  Hector  only burn'd  And burst like Light'ning thro' the Ranks and vow'd  To glut the God of Battles with his Blood  Aeneas  was the first who dar'd to stay  Apollo  wedg'd him in the Warrior's Way  But swell'd his Bosom with undaunted Might  Halfforc'd and halfpersuaded to the Fight  Like young  Lycaon  of the Royal Line  In Voice and Aspect seem'd the Pow'r divine  And bade the Chief reflect how late with Scorn  In distant Threats he brav'd the Goddessborn  Then thus the Hero of  Anchises'  Strain  To meet  Pelides  you persuade in vain  Already have I met nor void of Fear  Observ'd the Fury of his flying Spear  From  Ida  's Woods he chas'd us to the Field  Our Force he scatter'd and our Herds he kill'd  Lyrnessus Pedasus  in Ashes lay  But  Jove  assisting I surviv'd the Day  Else had I sunk opprest in fatal Fight  By fierce  Achilles  and  Minerva  's Might  Where'ere he mov'd the Goddess shone before  And bath'd his brazen Lance in hostile Gore  What mortal Man  Achilles  can sustain  Th'Immortals guard him thro' the dreadful Plain  And suffer not his Dart to fall in vain  Were God my Aid this Arm should check his Pow'r  Tho' strong in Battel as a brazen Tow'r  To whom the Son of  Jove  That God implore  And be what great  Achilles  was before  From heav'nly  Venus  thou deriv'st thy Strain  And he but from a Sister of the Main  An aged SeaGod Father of his Line  But  Jove  himself the sacred Source of thine  Then lift thy Weapon for a noble Blow  Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal Foe  This said and Spirit breath'd into his Breast  Thro' the thick Troops th'embolden'd Hero prest  His vent'rous Act the whitearm'd Queen survey'd  And thus assembling all the Pow'rs she said  Behold an Action Gods that claims your Care  Lo great  Aeneas  rushing to the War  Against  Pelides  he directs his Course  Phoebus  impells and  Phoebus  gives him Force  Restrain his bold Career at least t'attend  Our favour'd Hero let some Pow'r descend  To guard his Life and add to his Renown  We the great Armament of Heav'n came down  Hereafter let him fall as Fates design  That spun so short his Life's illustrious Line  But lest some adverse God now cross his Way  Give him to know what Pow'rs assist this Day  For how shall Mortal stand the dire Alarms  When Heav'ns refulgent Host appear in Arms  Thus she and thus the God whose Force can make  The solid Globe's eternal Basis shake  Against the Might of Man so feeble known  Why shou'd coelestial Pow'rs exert their own  Suffice from yonder Mount to view the Scene  And leave to War the Fates of mortal Men  But if th' Armipotent or God of Light  Obstruct  Achilles  or commence the Fight  Thence on the Gods of  Troy  we swift descend  Full soon I doubt not shall the Conflict end  And these in Ruin and Confusion hurl'd  Yield to our conqu'ring Arms the lower World  Thus having said the Tyrant of the Sea  Coerulean  Neptune  rose and led the Way  Advanc'd upon the Field there stood a Mound  Of Earth congested wall'd and trench'd around  In elder Times to guard  Alcides  made  The Work of  Trojans  with  Minerva  's Aid  Whattime a vengeful Monster of the Main  Swept the wide Shore and drove him to the Plain  Here  Neptune  and the Gods of  Greece  repair  With Clouds encompass'd and a Veil of Air  The adverse Pow'rs around  Apollo  laid  Crown the fair Hills that silver  Simois  shade  In Circle close each heav'nly Party sate  Intent to form the future Scheme of Fate  But mix not yet in Fight tho'  Jove  on high  Gives the loud signal and the Heav'ns reply  Meanwhile the rushing Armies hide the Ground  The trampled Center yields a hollow Sound  Steeds cas'd in Mail and Chiefs in Armour bright  The gleamy Champain glows with brazen Light  Amid both Hosts a dreadful Space appear  There great  Achilles  bold  Aeneas  here  With tow'ring Strides  Aeneas  first advanc'd  The nodding Plumage on his Helmet danc'd  Spread o'er his Breast the fencing Shield he bore  And as he mov'd his Jav'lin flam'd before  Not so  Pelides  furious to engage  He rush'd impetuous Such the Lion's Rage  Who viewing first his Foes with scornful Eyes  Tho' all in Arms the peopled City rise  Stalks careless on with unregarding Pride  Till at the length by some brave Youth defy'd  To His bold Spear the Savage turns alone  He murmurs Fury with an hollow Groan  He grins he foams he rolls his Eyes around  Lash'd by his Tail his heaving sides resound  He calls up all his Rage he grinds his Teeth  Resolv'd on Vengeance or resolv'd on Death  So fierce  Achilles  on  Aeneas  flies  So stands  Aeneas  and his Force defies  E'er yet the stern Encounter join'd begun  The Seed of  Thetis  thus to  Venus'  Son  Why comes  Aeneas  thro' the Ranks so far  Seeks he to meet  Achilles'  Arm in War  In hope the Realms of  Priam  to enjoy  And prove his Merits to the Throne of  Troy  Grant that beneath thy Lance  Achilles  dies  The partial Monarch may refuse the Prize  Sons he has many those thy Pride may quell  And 'tis his Fault to love those Sons too well  Or in reward of thy victorious Hand  Has  Troy  propos'd some spacious Tract of Land  An ample Forest or a fair Domain  Of Hills for Vines and Arable for Grain  Ev'n this perhaps will hardly prove thy Lot  But can  Achilles  be so soon forgot  Once as I think you saw this brandish'd Spear  And then the great  Aeneas  seem'd to fear  With hearty Haste from  Ida  's Mount he fled  Nor till he reach'd  Lyrnessus  turn'd his Head  Her lofty Walls not long our Progress stay'd  Those  Pallas Jove  and We in Ruins laid  In  Grecian  Chains her captive Race were cast  'Tis true the great  Aeneas  fled too fast  Defrauded of my Conquest once before  What then I lost the Gods this Day restore  Go while thou may'st avoid the threaten'd Fate  Fools stay to feel it and are wise too late  To this  Anchises'  Son Such Words employ  To one that fears thee some unwarlike Boy  Such we disdain the best may be defy'd  With mean Reproaches and unmanly Pride  Unworthy the high Race from which we came  Proclaim'd so loudly by the Voice of Fame  Each from illustrious Fathers draws his Line  Each Goddessborn half human half divine  Thetis'  this Day or  Venus'  Offspring dies  And Tears shall trickle from coelestial Eyes  For when two Heroes thus deriv'd contend  'Tis not in Words the glorious strife can end  If yet thou farther seek to learn my Birth  A Tale resounded thro' the spacious Earth  Hear how the glorious Origine we prove  From ancient  Dardanus  the first from  Jove  Dardania  's Walls he rais'd for  Ilion  then  The City since of manylanguag'd Men  Was not The Natives were content to till  The shady Foot of  Ida  's Fountful Hill  From  Dardanus  great  Erichthonius  springs  The richest once of  Asia  's wealthy Kings  Three thousand Mares his spacious Pastures bred  Three thousand Foals beside their Mothers fed  Boreas  enamour'd of the sprightly Train  Conceal'd his Godhead in a flowing Mane  With Voice dissembled to his Loves he neigh'd  And cours'd the dappled Beauties o'er the Mead  Hence sprung twelve others of unrival'd Kind  Swift as their Mother Mares and Father Wind  These lightly skimming when they swept the Plain  Nor ply'd the Grass nor bent the tender Grain  And when along the level Seas they flew  Scarce on the Surface curl'd the briny Dew  Such  Erichthonius  was From him there came  The sacred  Tros  of whom the  Trojan  Name  Three Sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial Bed  Ilus Assaracus  and  Ganymed  The matchless  Ganymed  divinely fair  Whom Heaven enamour'd snatch'd to upper Air  To bear the Cup of  Jove  Aetherial Guest  The Grace and Glory of th'Ambrosial Feast  The two remaining Sons the Line divide  First rose  Laomedon  from  Ilus'  Side  From him  Tithonus  now in Cares grown old  And  Priam  blest with  Hector  brave and bold  Clytius  and  Lampus  everhonour'd Pair  And  Hicetaon  Thunderbolt of War  From great  Assaracus  sprung  Capys  He  Begat  Anchises  and  Anchises  me  Such is our Race 'Tis Fortune gives us Birth  But  Jove  alone endues the Soul with Worth  He Source of Pow'r and Might with boundless Sway  All human Courage gives or takes away  Long in the Field of Words we may contend  Reproach is infinite and knows no end  Arm'd or with Truth or Falshood Right or Wrong  So voluble a Weapon is the Tongue  Wounded we wound and neither side can fail  For ev'ry Man has equal Strength to rail  Women alone when in the Streets they jar  Perhaps excel us in this wordy War  Like us they stand encompass'd with the Crowd  And vent their Anger impotent and loud  Cease thenOur Business in the Field of Fight  Is not to question but to prove our Might  To all those Insults thou hast offer'd here  Receive this Answer 'Tis my flying Spear  He spoke With all his Force the Jav'lin flung  Fix'd deep and loudly in the Buckler rung  Far on his outstretch'd Arm  Pelides  held  To meet the thund'ring Lance his dreadful Shield  That trembled as it stuck nor void of Fear  Saw e'er it fell th'immeasurable Spear  His Fears were vain impenetrable Charms  Secur'd the Temper of th'Aetherial Arms  Thro' two strong Plates the Point its Passage held  But stopp'd and rested by the third repell'd  Five Plates of various Metal various Mold  Compos'd the Shield of Brass each outward Fold  Of Tin each inward and the middle Gold  There stuck the Lance Then rising e'er he threw  The forceful Spear of great  Achilles  flew  And pierc'd the  Dardan  Shield's extremest Bound  Where the shrill Brass return'd a sharper Sound  Thro' the thin Verge the  Pelian  Weapon glides  And the slight Cov'ring of expanded Hydes  Aeneas  his contracted Body bends  And o'er him high the riven Targe extends  Sees thro' its parting Plates the upper Air  And at his Back perceives the quiv'ring Spear  A Fate so near him chills his Soul with Fright  And swims before his Eyes the manycolour'd Light  Achilles  rushing in with dreadful Cries  Draws his broad Blade and at  Aeneas  flies  Aeneas  rouzing as the Foe came on  With Force collected heaves a mighty Stone  A Mass enormous which in modern Days  No two of Earth's degen'rate Sons could raise  But Ocean's God whose Earthquakes rock the Ground  Saw the Distress and mov'd the Pow'rs around  Lo on the Brink of Fate  Aeneas  stands  An instant Victim to  Achilles  Hands  By  Phoebus  urg'd but  Phoebus  has bestow'd  His Aid in vain The Man o'erpow'rs the God  And can ye see this righteous Chief attone  With guiltless Blood for Vices not his own  To all the Gods his constant Vows were paid  Sure tho' he wars for  Troy  he claims our Aid  Fate wills not this nor thus can  Jove  resign  The future Father of the  Dardan  Line  The first great Ancestor obtain'd his Grace  And still his Love descends on all the Race  For  Priam  now and  Priam  's faithless Kind  At length are odious to th'allseeing Mind  On great  Aeneas  shall devolve the Reign  And Sons succeeding Sons the lasting Line sustain  The great Earthshaker thus To whom replies  Th'Imperial Goddess with the radiant Eyes  Good as he is to immolate or spare  The  Dardan  Prince O  Neptune  be thy Care  Pallas  and I by all that Gods can bind  Have sworn Destruction to the  Trojan  Kind  Not ev'n an Instant to protract their Fate  Or save one Member of the sinking State  Till her last Flame be quench'd with her last Gore  And ev'n her crumbling Ruins are no more  The King of Ocean to the Fight descends  Thro' all the whistling Darts his Course he bends  Swift interpos'd between the Warriors flies  And casts thick Darkness o'er  Achilles'  Eyes  From great  Aeneas'  Shield the Spear he drew  And at its Master's Feet the Weapon threw  That done with Force divine he snatch'd on high  The  Dardan  Prince and bore him thro' the Sky  Smoothgliding without Step above the Heads  Of warring Heroes and of bounding Steeds  Till at the Battel's utmost Verge they light  Where the slow  Caucons  close the Rear of Fight  The Godhead there his heav'nly Form confess'd  With Words like these the panting Chief address'd  What Pow'r O Prince with Force inferior far  Urg'd thee to meet  Achilles'  Arm in War  Henceforth beware nor antedate thy Doom  Defrauding Fate of all thy Fame to come  But when the Day decreed for come it must  Shall lay this dreadful Hero in the Dust  Let then the Furies of that Arm be known  Secure no  Grecian  Force transcends thy own  With that he left him wond'ring as he lay  Then from  Achilles  chas'd the Mist away  Sudden returning with the Stream of Light  The Scene of War came rushing on his Sight  Then thus amaz'd What Wonders strike my Mind  My Spear that parted on the Wings of Wind  Laid here before me and the  Dardan  Lord  That fell this instant vanish'd from my Sword  I thought alone with Mortals to contend  But Pow'rs coelestial sure this Foe defend  Great as he is our Arm he scarce will try  Content for once with all his Gods to fly  Now then let others bleedThis said aloud  He vents his Fury and inflames the Crowd  O  Greeks  he cries and every Rank alarms  Join Battel Man to Man and Arms to Arms  'Tis not in me tho' favour'd by the Sky  To mow whole Troops and make whole Armies fly  No God can singly such a Host engage  Not  Mars  himself nor great  Minerva  's Rage  But whatsoe'er  Achilles  can inspire  Whate'er of active Force or acting Fire  Whate'er this Heart can prompt or Hand obey  All all  Achilles Greeks  is yours to Day  Thro' yon wide Host this Arm shall scatter Fear  And thin the Squadrons with my single Spear  He said Nor less elate with martial Joy  The godlike  Hector  warm'd the Troops of  Troy  Trojans  to War Think  Hector  leads you on  Nor dread the Vaunts of  Peleus'  haughty Son  Deeds must decide our Fate Ev'n those with Words  Insult the Brave who tremble at their Swords  The weakest AtheistWretch all Heav'n defies  But shrinks and shudders when the Thunder flies  Nor from yon' Boaster shall your Chief retire  Not tho' his Heart were Steel his Hands were Fire  That Fire that Steel your  Hector  shou'd withstand  And brave that vengeful Heart that dreadful Hand  Thus breathing Rage thro' all the Hero said  A Wood of Lances rises round his Head  Clamors on Clamors tempest all the Air  They join they throng they thicken to the War  But  Phoebus  warns him from high Heav'n to shun  The single Fight with  Thetis'  godlike Son  More safe to combate in the mingled Band  Nor tempt too near the Terrors of his Hand  He hears obedient to the God of Light  And plung'd within the Ranks awaits the Fight  Then fierce  Achilles  shouting to the Skies  On  Troy  's whole Force with boundless Fury flies  First falls  Iphytion  at his Army's Head  Brave was the Chief and brave the Host he led  From great  Otrynteus  he deriv'd his Blood  His Mother was a  Nais  of the Flood  Beneath the Shades of  Tmolus  crown'd with Snow  From  Hyde  's Walls he rul'd the Lands below  Fierce as he springs the Sword his Head divides  The parted Visage falls on equal Sides  With loudresounding Arms he strikes the Plain  While thus  Achilles  glories o'er the Slain  Lye there  Otryntides  the  Trojan  Earth  Receives thee dead tho'  Gygae  boast thy Birth  Those beauteous Fields where  Hyllus'  Waves are roll'd  And plenteous  Hermus  swells with Tides of Gold  Are thine no moreTh'insulting Hero said  And left him sleeping in Eternal Shade  The rolling Wheels of  Greece  the Body tore  And dash'd their Axles with no vulgar Gore  Demoleon  next  Antenor  's Offspring laid  Breathless in Dust the Price of Rashness paid  Th'impatient Steel with fulldescending Sway  Forc'd thro' his brazen Helm its furious Way  Resistless drove the batter'd Skull before  And dash'd and mingled all the Brains with Gore  This sees  Hippodamas  and seiz'd with Fright  Deserts his Chariot for a swifter Flight  The Lance arrests him an ignoble Wound  The panting  Trojan  rivets to the Ground  He groans away his Soul Not louder roars  At  Neptunes  Shrine on  Helice  's high Shores  The Victim Bull the Rocks rebellow round  And Ocean listens to the grateful Sound  Then fell on  Polydore  his vengeful Rage  The youngest Hope of  Priam  's stooping Age  Whose Feet for Swiftness in the Race surpast  Of all his Sons the dearest and the last  To the forbidden Field he takes his Flight  In the first Folly of a youthful Knight  To vaunt his Swiftness wheels around the Plain  But vaunts not long with all his Swiftness slain  Struck where the crossing Belts unite behind  And golden Rings the double Backplate join'd  Forth thro' the Navel burst the thrilling Steel  And on his Knees with piercing Shrieks he fell  The rushing Entrails pour'd upon the Ground  His Hands collect and Darkness wraps him round  When  Hector  view'd all ghastly in his Gore  Thus sadly slain th'unhappy  Polydore  A Cloud of Sorrow overcast his Sight  His Soul no longer brook'd the distant Fight  Full in  Achilles'  dreadful Front he came  And shook his Jav'lin like a waving Flame  The Son of  Peleus  sees with Joy possest  His Heart highbounding in his rising Breast  And lo the Man on whom black Fates attend  The Man that slew  Achilles  in his Friend  No more shall  Hector  's and  Pelides'  Spear  Turn from each other in the Walks of War  Then with revengeful Eyes he scan'd him o'er  Come and receive thy Fate He spake no more  Hector  undaunted thus Such Words employ  To one that dreads thee some unwarlike Boy  Such we could give defying and defy'd  Mean Intercourse of Obloquy and Pride  I know thy Force to mine superior far  But Heav'n alone confers Success in War  Mean as I am the Gods may guide my Dart  And give it Entrance in a braver Heart  Then parts the Lance But  Pallas'  heav'nly Breath  Far from  Achilles  wafts the winged Death  The bidden Dart again to  Hector  flies  And at the Feet of its great Master lies  Achilles  closes with his hated Foe  His Heart and Eyes with flaming Fury glow  But present to his Aid  Apollo  shrouds  The favour'd Hero in a Veil of Clouds  Thrice struck  Pelides  with indignant Heart  Thrice in impassive Air he plung'd the Dart  The Spear a fourth time bury'd in the Cloud  He foams with Fury and exclaims aloud  Wretch Thou hast scap'd again Once more thy Flight  Has sav'd thee and the partial God of Light  But long thou shalt not thy just Fate withstand  If any Pow'r assist  Achilles'  Hand  Fly then inglorious But thy Flight this Day  Whole Hecatombs of  Trojan  Ghosts shall pay  With that he gluts his Rage on Numbers slain  Then  Dryops  tumbled to th'ensanguin'd Plain  Pierc'd thro' the Neck He left him panting there  And stopp'd  Demuchus  great  Philetor  's Heir  Gigantic Chief Deep gash'd th'enormous Blade  And for the Soul an ample Passage made  Laogonus  and  Dardanus  expire  The valiant Sons of an unhappy Sire  Both in one Instant from the Chariot hurl'd  Sunk in one Instant to the nether World  This Diff'rence only their sad Fates afford  That one the Spear destroy'd and one the Sword  Nor less unpity'd young  Alastor  bleeds  In vain his Youth in vain his Beauty pleads  In vain he begs thee with a Suppliant's Moan  To spare a Form and Age so like thy own  Unhappy Boy no Pray'r no moving Art  E'er bent that fierce inexorable Heart  While yet he trembled at his Knees and cry'd  The ruthless Falchion op'd his tender Side  The panting Liver pours a Flood of Gore  That drowns his Bosom till he pants no more  Thro'  Mulius'  Head then drove th'impetuous Spear  The Warrior falls transfix'd from Ear to Ear  Thy Life  Echeclus  next the Sword bereaves  Deep thro' his Front the pond'rous Falchion cleaves  Warm'd in the Brain the smoaking Weapon lies  The purple Death comes floating o'er his Eyes  Then brave  Deucalion  dy'd The Dart was flung  Where the knit Nerves the plaint Elbow strung  He dropp'd his Arm an unassisting Weight  And stood all impotent expecting Fate  Full on his Neck the falling Falchion sped  From his broad Shoulders hew'd his crested Head  Forth from the Bone the spinal Marrow flies  And sunk in Dust the Corps extended lies  Rhigmus  whose Race from fruitful  Thracia  came  The Son of  Pireus  an illustrious Name  Succeeds to Fate The Spear his Belly rends  Prone from his Car the thund'ring Chief descends  The Squire who saw expiring on the Ground  His prostrate Master rein'd the Steeds around  His Back scarce turn'd the  Pelian  Jav'lin gor'd  And stretch'd the Servant o'er his dying Lord  As when a Flame the winding Valley fills  And runs on crackling Shrubs between the Hills  Then o'er the Stubble up the Mountain flies  Fires the high Woods and blazes to the Skies  This way and that the spreading Torrent roars  So sweeps the Hero thro' the wasted Shores  Around him wide immense Destruction pours  And Earth is delug'd with the sanguine Show'rs  As with Autumnal Harvests cover'd o'er  And thick bestrown lies  Ceres'  sacred Floor  When round and round with neverweary'd Pain  The trampling Steers beat out th'unnumber'd Grain  So the fierce Coursers as the Chariot rolls  Tread down whole Ranks and crush out Hero's Souls  Dash'd from their Hoofs while o'er the Dead they fly  Black bloody Drops the smoaking Chariot die  The spiky Wheels thro' Heaps of Carnage tore  And thick the groaning Axles dropp'd with Gore  High o'er the Scene of Death  Achilles  stood  All grim with Dust all horrible in Blood  Yet still insatiate still with Rage on flame  Such is the Lust of neverdying Fame  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Twentieth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TWENTIETH BOOK  I  VERSE  Then  Jove  to  Themis  gives Command  c  The Poet is now to bring his Hero again into Action and he introduces him with the utmost Pomp and Grandeur The Gods are assembled only upon this account and  Jupiter  permits several Deities to join with the  Trojans  and hinder  Achilles  from overruling Destiny itself  The Circumstance of sending  Themis  to assemble the Gods is very beautiful she is the Goddess of Justice the  Trojans  by the Rape of  Helen  and by repeated Perjuries having broken her Laws she is the properest Messenger to summon a Synod to bring them to punishment  Eustathius  Proclus  has given a farther Explanation of this  Themis  or  Justice  says he is made to assemble the Gods round  Jupiter  because it is from him that all the Powers of Nature take their Virtue and receive their Orders and  Jupiter  sends them to the Relief of both Parties to shew that nothing  falls out but by his Permission and that neither Angels nor Men nor the Elements act but according to the Power which is given them  II  VERSE  All but old Ocean    Eustathius  gives two Reasons why  Oceanus  was absent from this Assembly The one is because he is fabled to be the Original of all the Gods and it would have been a peice of Indecency for him to see the Deities who were all his Descendents war upon one another by joining adverse Parties The other Reason he draws from the Allegory of  Oceanus  which signifies the Element of Water and consequently the whole Element could not ascend into the Aether But whereas  Neptune  the Rivers and the Fountains are said to have been present this is no way impossible if we consider it in an allegorical Sense which implies that the Rivers Seas and Fountains supply the Air with Vapours and by that means ascend into the Aether  III  VERSE  Coelestial Pow'rs descend  And as your Minds direct your Succour lend To either Host    Eustathius  informs us that the Ancients were very much divided upon this Passage of  Homer  Some have criticised it and others have answer'd their Criticism but he reports nothing more than the Objection without transmitting the Answer to us Those who condemned  Homer  said  Jupiter  was for the  Trojans  he saw the  Greeks  were the strongest so permitted the Gods to declare themselves and go to the Battel But therein that God is deceived and does not gain his Point for the Gods who favour the  Greeks  being stronger than those who favour the  Trojans  the  Greeks  will still have the same Advantage I do not know what Answer the Partisans of  Homer  made but for my part I think this Objection is more ingenious than solid  Jupiter  does not pretend  that the  Trojans  shou'd be stronger than the  Greeks  he has only a mind that the Decree of Destiny should be executed Destiny had refused to  Achilles  the Glory of taking  Troy  but if  Achilles  fights singly against the  Trojans  he is capable of forcing Destiny as  Homer  has already elsewhere said that there had been brave Men who had done so Whereas if the Gods took part tho those who followed the  Grecians  were stronger than those who were for the  Trojans  the latter wou'd however be strong enough to support Destiny and to hinder  Achilles  from making himself Master of  Troy  This was  Jupiter  's sole View Thus is this Passage far from being blameable it is on the contrary very beautiful and infinitely glorious for  Achilles Dacier  IV  VERSE  Or  Ilion  's sacred Wall  May fall this Day tho' Fate forbid the Fall    Mons  de la Motte  criticizes on this Passage as thinking it absurd and contradictory to  Homer  's own System to imagine that what Fate had ordained should not come to pass  Jupiter  here seems to fear that  Troy  will be taken this very Day in spite of Destiny  M  Boivin  answers that the Explication hereof depends wholly upon the Principles of the ancient Pagan Theology and their Doctrine concerning Fate It is certain according to  Homer  and  Virgil  that which Destiny had decreed did not constantly happen in the precise Time mark'd by Destiny the fatal Moment was not to be retarded but might be hastened For example that of the Death of  Dido  was advanced by the Blow she gave herself her Hour was not then come  Nec fato merita nec morte peribat  Sed misera ante diem  Every violent Death was accounted  that is before the fated Time or which is the same thing against the natural Order  turbato mortalitatis ordine  as the  Romans  express'd  it And the same might be said of any Misfortunes which Men drew upon themselves by their own ill Conduct See the  th  Note on lib In a word it must be allowed that it was not easy in the Pagan Religion to form the juses Ideas upon a Doctrine so difficult to be clear'd and upon which it is no great wonder if a Poet should not always be perfectly consistent with himself when it has puzzel'd such a Number of Divines and Philosophers  V  VERSE  On adverse Parts the warring Gods engage  Heav'ns awful Queen  c  Eusahius  has a very curious Remark upon this Division of the Gods in  Homer  which M  Dacier  has entirely borrowed as indeed no Commentator ever borrowed more or acknowledg'd less than she has every where done from  Eustathius  This Division says he is not made at random but founded upon very solid Reasons drawn from the Nature of those two Nations He places on the Side of the  Greeks  all the Gods who preside over Arts and Sciences to signify how much in that Respect the  Greeks  excell'd all other Nations  Juno Pallas Neptune Mercury  and  Vulcan  are for the  Greeks Juno  not only as the Goddess who presides over Marriage and who is concern'd to revenge an Injury done to the nuptial Bed but likewise as the Goddess who represents Monarchical Government which was better establish'd in  Greece  than any where else  Pallas  because being the Goddess of War and Wisdom she ought to assist those who are wrong'd besides the  Greeks  understood the Art of War better than the  Barbarians Neptune  because he was an Enemy to the  Trojans  upon account of  Laomedon  's Persidiousness and because most of the  Greeks  being come from the Islands or Peninsula's they were in some sort his Subjects  Mercury  because he is a God who presides over Stratagems of War and because  Troy  was taken by that of the wooden Horse and lastly  Vulcan  as the declared Enemy of  Mars  and of all Adulterers and as the Father of Arts  VI  VERSE  Mars fieryhelm'd the Laughter loving Dame    The Reasons why  Mars  and  Venus  engage for the  Trojans  are very obvious the Point in hand was to favour Ravishers and Debauchees But the same Reason you will say does not serve for  Apollo Diana  and  Latona  It is urg'd that  Apollo  is for the  Trojans  because of the Darts and Arrows which were the principal Strength of the  Barbarians  and  Diana  because she presided over Dancing and those  Barbarians  were great Dancers and  Latona  as influenc'd by her Children  Xanthus  being a  Trojan  River is interested for his Countrey  Eustathius  VII  VERSE  Above the Sire of Gods  c  "The Images says  Longinus  which  Homer  gives of the Combate of the Gods have in 'em something prodigiously great and magnificent We see in these Verses the Earth open'd to its very Center Hell ready to disclose itself the whole Machine of the World upon the Point to be destroyed and overturn'd To shew that in such a Conflict Heaven and Hell all Things mortal and immortal the whole Creation in short was engag'd in this Battel and all the Extent of Nature in Danger"  Non secus ac si qua penitus vi terra dehiscens  Infernas reseret Sedes Regna recludat  Pallida Diis invisa superque immane barathrum  Cernatur trepidentque immisso lumine Manes  Virgil  Madam  Dacier  rightly observes that this Copy is inferior to the Original on this account that  Virgil  has made a Comparison of that which  Homer  made an Action This occasions an infinite Difference which is easy to be perceiv'd  One may compare with this noble Passage of  Homer  the Battel of the Gods and Giants in  Hesiod  's  Theogony  which is one of the sublimest Parts of that Author and  Milton  's Battel of the  Angels  in the sixth Book The Elevation and Enthusiasm of our great Countryman seems owing to this Original  VIII  VERSE  First silver shafted  Phoebus  took the Plain  c  With what Art does the Poet engage the Gods in this Conflict  Neptune  opposes  Apollo  which implies that Things moist and dry are in continual Discord  Pallas  fights with  Mars  which signifies that Rashness and Wisdom always disagree  Juno  is against  Diana  that is nothing more differs from a Marriage State than Celibacy  Vulcan  engages  Xanthus  that is Fire and Water are in perpetual Variance Thus we have a fine Allegory conceal'd under the Veil of excellent Poetry and the Reader receives a double Satisfaction at the same time from beautiful Verses and an instructive Moral  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  Already have I met  c  Eustathius  remarks that the Poet lets no Opportunity pass of inserting into his Poem the Actions that preceded the tenth Year of the War especially the Actions of  Achilles  the Hero of it In this place he brings in  Aeneas  extolling the Bravery of his Enemy and confessing himself to have formerly been vanquish'd by him At the same time he preserves a piece of ancient History by inserting into the Poem the Hero's Conquest of  Pedasus  and  Lyrnessus  X  VERSE  From  Ida  's Woods he chas'd us  But  Jove  assisting I surviv'd    It is remarkable that  Aeneas  owed his Safety to his Flight from  Achilles  but it may seem strange that  Achilles  who was  so fam'd for his Swiftness should not be able to overtake him even with  Minerva  for his Guide  Eustathius  answers that this might proceed from the better Knowledge  Aeneas  might have of the Ways and Defiles  Achilles  being a Stranger and  Aeneas  having long kept his Father's Flocks in those Parts  He farther observes that the Word  discovers that it was in the Night that  Achilles  pursu'd  Aeneas  XI  VERSE  Advanc'd upon the Field there stood a Mound  c  It may not be unnecessary to explain this Passage to make it understood by the Reader The Poet is very short in the Description as supposing the Fact already known and hastens to the Combat between  Achilles  and  Aeneas  This is very judicious in  Homer  not to dwell on a piece of History that had no relation to his Action when he has rais'd the Reader's Expectation by so pompous an Introduction and made the Gods themselves his Spectators  The Story is as follows  Laomedon  having defrauded  Neptune  of the Reward he promis'd him for the building the Walls of  Troy Neptune  sent a monstrous Whale to which  Laomedon  exposed his Daughter  Hesione  But  Hercules  having undertaken to destroy the Monster the  Trojans  rais'd an Intrenchment to defend  Hercules  from his Pursuit This being a remarkable piece of Conduct in the  Trojans  it gave occasion to the Poet to adorn a plain Narration with Fiction by ascribing the Work to  Pallas  the Goddess of Wisdom  Eustathius  XII  VERSE  Here  Neptune  and the Gods  c  I wonder why  Eustathius  and all other Commentators should be silent upon this Recess of the Gods It seems strange at the first view that so many Deities after having enter'd the Scene of Action shou'd perform so short a Part and immediately become  themselves Spectators I conceive the reason of this Conduct in the Poet to be that  Achilles  has been inactive during the greatest part of the Poem and as he is the Hero of it ought to be the chief Character in it The Poet therefore withdraws the Gods from the Field that  Achilles  may have the whole Honour of the Day and not act in subordination to the Deities Besides the Poem now draws to a Conclusion and it is necessary for  Homer  to enlarge upon the Exploits of  Achilles  that he may leave a noble Idea of his Valour upon the Mind of the Reader  XIII  VERSE c  The Conversation of  Achilles  and  Aeneas  I shall lay before the Reader the Words of  Eustathius  in defence of this Passage which I confess seems to me to be faulty in the Poet The Reader says he would naturally expect some great and terrible Atchievements should ensue from  Achilles  upon his first entrance upon Action The Poet seems to prepare us for it by his magnificent Introduction of him into the Field But instead of a Storm we have a Calm he follows the same Method in this Book as he did in the third where when both Armies were ready to engage in a general Conflict he ends the Day in a single Combate between two Heroes Thus he always agreeably surprizes his Readers Besides the Admirers of  Homer  reap a farther Advantage from this Conversation of the Heroes There is a Chain of ancient History as well as a Series of poetical Beauties  Madam  Dacier  's Excuse is very little better And to shew that this is really a Fault in the Poet I believe I may appeal to the Taste of every Reader who certainly finds himself disappointed Our Expectation is rais'd to see Gods and Heroes engage when suddenly it all sinks into such a Combat in which neither Party receive a Wound and what is more extraordinary the Gods are made the Spectators of so small an Action What occasion was there for Thunder Earthquakes and descending Deities to introduce a Matter of so little Importance  Neither is it any Excuse to say he has given us a peice of ancient History We expected to read a Poet not an Historian In short after the greatest Preparation for Action imaginable he suspends the whole Narration and from the Heat of a Poet cools at once into the Simplicity of an Historian  XIV  VERSE  The Natives were content to till  The shady Foot of  Ida  's Fountful Hill  Plato  and  Strabo  understand this Passage as favouring the Opinion that the Mountainous Parts of the World were first inhabited after the universal Deluge and that Mankind by degrees descended to dwell in the lower parts of the Hills which they would have the Word  signify and only in greater process of Time ventur'd into the Valleys  Virgil  however seems to have taken this Word in a Sense something different where he alludes to this Passage  Aen    Nondum Ilium et arces  Pergameae steterant habitabant vallibus imis  XV  VERSE  Three thousand Mares  c  The Number of the Horses and Mares of  Ericthonius  may seem incredible were we not assured by  Herodotus  that there were in the Stud of  Cyrus  at one time besides those for the Service of War eight hundred Horses and six thousand six hundred Mares  Eustathius  XVI  VERSE Boreas  enamour'd  c  Homer  has the Happiness of making the least Circumstance considerable the Subject grows under his Hands and the plainest Matter shines in his Dress of Poetry Another Poet would have said these Horses were as swift as the Wind but  Homer  tells you that they sprung from  Boreas  the God of Wind and thence drew their Swiftness  XVII  VERSE  These lightly skimming as they swept the Plain    The Poet illustrates the Swiftness of these Horses by describing them as running over the standing Corn and Surface of Waters without making any Impression  Virgil  has imitated these Lines and adapts what  Homer  says of these Horses to the Swiftness of  Camilla Aen    Illa vel Intactae segetis per summa volaret  Gramina nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas  Vel mare per medium fluctu supensa tumenti  Ferret iter celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas  The Reader will easily perceive that  Virgil  's is almost a literal Translation He has imitated the very run of the Verses which flow nimbly away in Dactyls and as swift as the Wind they describe  I cannot but observe one thing in favour of  Homer  that there can no greater Commendation be given to him than by considering the Conduct of  Virgil  who tho' undoubtedly the greatest Poet after him seldom ventures to vary much from his Original in the Passages he takes from him as in a Despair of improving and contented if he can but equal them  XVIII  VERSE  To bear the Cup of  Jove  To be a Cupbearer has in all Ages and Nations been reckon'd an honourable Employment  Sappho  mentions it in honour of her Brother  Larichus  that he was Cupbearer to the Nobles of  Mitylene  The Son of  Menelaus  executed the same Office  Hebe  and  Mercury  serv'd the Gods in the same Station  It was the Custom in the Pagan Worship to employ noble Youths to pour the Wine upon the Sacrifice In this Office  Ganymede  might probably attend upon the Altar of  Jupiter  and from thence was fabled to be his Cupbearer  Eustath  XIX  VERSE  But Ocean's God  c  The Conduct of the Poet in making  Aeneas  owe his Safety to  Neptune  in this place is remarkable  Neptune  is an Enemy to the  Trojans  yet he dares not suffer so pious a Man to fall lest  Jupiter  should be offended This shews says  Eustathius  that Piety is always under the Protection of God and that Favours are sometimes conferred not out of Kindness but to prevent a greater Detriment thus  Neptune  preserves  Aeneas  lest  Jupiter  should revenge his Death upon the  Grecians  XX  VERSE  And can ye see this righteous Chief  c  Tho'  Aeneas  is represented a Man of great Courage yet his Piety is his most shining Character This is the reason why he is always the Care of the Gods and they favour him constantly thro' the whole Poem with their immediate Protection  'Tis in this Light that  Virgil  has presented him to the View of the Reader His Valour bears but the second Place in the  Aeneis  In the  Ilias  indeed he is drawn in Miniature and in the  Aeneis  in full Length but there are the same Features in the Copy which are in the Original and he is the same  Aeneas  in  Rome  as he was in  Troy  XXI  VERSE  On great  Aeneas  shall devolve the Reign  And Sons succeeding Sons the Line sustain  The Story of  Aeneas  his founding the  Roman  Empire gave  Virgil  the finest Occasion of paying a Complement to  Augustus  and his Countrymen who were fond of being thought the Descendants of  Troy  He has translated these two Lines literally and put them in the nature of a Prophecy as the Favourers of the Opinion of  Aeneas  's sailing into  Italy  imagine  Homer  's to be    Hic domus  Aeneae  cunctis dominabitur oris  Et nati natorum qui nascentur ab illis  There has been a very ancient Alteration made as  Strabo  observes in these two Lines by substituting  in the room of  It is not improbable but  Virgil  might give occasion for it by his  cunctis dominabitur oris  Eustathius  does not entirely discountenance this Story If it be understood says he as a Prophecy the Poet might take it from the  Sibylline Oracles  He farther remarks that the Poet artfully interweaves into his Poem not only the things which happen'd before the Commencement and in the Prosecution of the  Trojan  War but other Matters of Importance which happen'd even after that War was brought to a Conclusion Thus for instance we have here a peice of History not extant in any other Author by which we are inform'd that the House of  Aeneas  succeeded to the Crown of  Troas  and to the Kingdom of  Priam Eustathius  This Passage is very considerable for it ruins the famous Chimaera of the  Roman  Empire and of the Family of the  Caesars  who both pretended to deduce their Original from  Venus  by  Aeneas  alledging that after the taking of  Troy Aeneas  came into  Italy  and this Pretension is hereby actually  destroy'd This Testimony of  Homer  ought to be look'd upon as an authentick Act the Fidelity and Verity whereof cannot be questioned  Neptune  as much an Enemy as he is to the  Trojans  declares that  Aeneas  and after him his Posterity shall reign over the  Trojans  Wou'd  Homer  have put this Prophecy in  Neptune  's Mouth if he had not known that  Aeneas  did not leave  Troy  that he reigned therein and if he had not seen in his Time the Descendants of that Prince reign there likewise That Poet wrote Years or thereabouts after the taking of  Troy  and what is very remarkable he wrote in some of the Towns of  Ionia  that is to say in the Neighbourhood of  Phrygia  so that the Time and Place give such a Weight to his Deposition that nothing can invalidate it All that the Historians have written concerning  Aeneas  's Voyage into  Italy  ought to be consider'd as a Romance made on purpose to destroy all historical Truth for the most ancient is posterior to  Homer  by many Ages Before  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  some Writers being sensible of the Strength of this Passage of  Homer  undertook to explain it so as to reconcile it with this Fable and they said that  Aeneas  after having been in  Italy  return'd to  Troy  and left his Son  Ascanius  there  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  little satisfy'd with this Solution which did not seem to him to be probable has taken another Method He would have it that by these Words  "He shall reign over the  Trojans  Homer  meant he shall reign over the  Trojans  whom he shall carry with him into  Italy  "Is it not possible says he that  Aeneas  should reign over the  Trojans  whom he had taken with him though settled elsewhere  That Historian who wrote in  Rome  itself and in the very Reign of  Augustus  was willing to make his Court to that Prince by explaining this Passage of  Homer  so as to favour the Chimaera he was possess'd with And this is a Reproach that may with some Justice be cast on him for Poets may by their Fictions flatter Princes and welcome Tis their Trade But for Historians to corrupt the Gravity and Severity of History to substitute Fable in the place of Truth is what ought not to be pardon'd  Strabo  was much more religious for though he wrote his Books of Geography towards  the Beginning of  Tiberius  's Reign yet he had the Courage to give a right Explication to this Passage of  Homer  and to aver that this Poet said and meant that  Aeneas  remain'd at  Troy  that he reign'd therein  Priam  's whole Race being extinguish'd and that he left the Kingdom to his Children after him  lib  You may see this whole Matter discuss'd in a Letter from the famous M  Bochart  to M  de Segrais  who has prefix'd it to his Remarks upon the Translation of  Virgil  XXII  VERSE  Where the slow  Caucons  close the Rear    The  Caucones  says  Eustathius  were of  Paphlagonian  Extract And this Perhaps was the Reason why they are not distinctly mention'd in the Catalogue they being included under the general Name of  Paphlagonians  Tho' two Lines are quoted which are said to have been left out by some Transcriber and immediately followed this  Which Verses are these  Or as others read it    Or according to others  But I believe these are not  Homer  's Lines but the Addition of some Transcriber and tis evident by consulting the Passage from which they are said to have been curtail'd that they would be absurd in that place for the second Line is actually there already and as these  Caucons  are said to live upon the Banks of the  Parthenius  so are the  Paphlagonians  in the abovemention'd Passage It is therefore more probable that the  Caucons  are included in the  Paphlagonians  XXIII  VERSE  Not louder roars  At  Neptune  's Shrine on  Helice  's high Shores  c  In  Helice  a Town of  Achaia  three quarters of a League from the Gulph of  Corinth Neptune  had a magnificent Temple where the  Ionians  offer'd every Year to him a Sacrifice of a Bull and it was with these People an auspicious Sign and a certain Mark that the Sacrifice would be accepted if the Bull bellow'd as it was led to the Altar After the  Ionic  Migration which happen'd about Years after the taking of  Troy  the  Ionians  of  Asia  assembled in the Fields of  Priene  to celebrate the same Festival in honour of  Heliconian Neptune  and as those of  Priene  valued themselves upon being originally of  Helice  they chose for the King of the Sacrifice a young  Prienian  It is needless to dispute from whence the Poet has taken his Comparison for as he liv'd a or Years after the  Ionic  Migration it cannot be doubted but he took it in the  Asian Ionia  and at  Priene  itself where he had doubtless often assisted at that Sacrifice and been Witness of the Ceremonies therein observed This Poet always appears strongly addicted to the Customs of the  Ionians  which makes some conjecture that he was an  Ionian  himself  Eustathius Dacier  XXIV  VERSE  Then fell on  Polydore  his vengeful Rage    Euripides  in his  Hecuba  has follow'd another Tradition when he makes  Polydorus  the Son of  Priam  and of  Hecuba  and makes him slain by  Polymnestor  King of  Thrace  after the taking of  Troy  for according to  Homer  he is not the Son of  Hecuba  but of  Laothoe  as he says in the following Book and is slain by  Achilles Virgil  too has rather chosen to follow  Euripides  than  Homer  XXV  VERSE  Full in  Achilles  dreadful Front he came    The great Judgment of the Poet in keeping the Character of his Hero is in this place very evident When  Achilles  was to engage  Aeneas  he holds a long Conference with him and with Patience bears the Reply of  Aeneas  Had he pursu'd the same Method with  Hector  he had departed from his Character Anger is the prevailing Passion in  Achilles  He left the Field in a Rage against  Agamemnon  and enter'd it again to be reveng'd of  Hector  The Poet therefore judiciously makes him take Fire at the sight of his Enemy He describes him as impatient to kill him he gives him a haughty Challenge and that Challenge is comprehended in a single Line His Impatience to be reveng'd would not suffer him to delay it by a Length of Words  XXVI  VERSE  But present to his Aid  Apollo  It is a common Observation that a God should never be introduced into a Poem but where his Presence is necessary And it may be ask'd why the Life of  Hector  is of such Importance that  Apollo  should rescue him from the Hand of  Achilles  here and yet suffer him to fall so soon after  Eustathius  answers that the Poet had not yet sufficiently exalted the Valour of  Achilles  he takes time to enlarge upon his Atchievements and rises by degrees in his Character till he completes both his Courage and Resentment at one Blow in the Death of  Hector  And the Poet adds he pays a great Complement to his favourite Countryman by shewing that nothing but the Intervention of a God could have sav'd  Aeneas  and  Hector  from the Hand of  Achilles  XXVII  VERSE  No Pray'r no moving Art  E'er bent that fierce inexorable Heart    I confess it is a Satisfaction to me to observe with what Art the Poet pursues  his Subject The opening of the Poem professes to treat of the Anger of  Achilles  that Anger draws on all the great Events of the Story And  Homer  at every Opportunity awakens the Reader to an Attention to it by mentioning the Effects of it So that when we see in this place the Hero deaf to Youth and Compassion it is what we expect Mercy in him would offend because it is contrary to his Character  Homer  proposes him not as a Pattern for Imitation but the Moral of the Poem which he design'd the Reader should draw from it is that we should avoid Anger since it is ever pernicious in the Event  XXIX  VERSE  The trampling Steers beat out the unnumber'd Grain    In  Greece  instead of threshing the Corn as we do they caus'd it to be trod out by Oxen this was likewise practis'd in  Judaea  as is seen by the Law of God who forbad the  Jews  to muzzle the Ox who trod out the Corn  Non ligabis os bovis terentis in areâ fruges tuas  Deuteron  Dacier  The self same Practice is still preserved among the  Turks  and modern  Greeks  XXX  The Similes at the End    It is usual with our Author to heap his Similes very thick together at the Conclusion of a Book He has done the same in the seventeenth 'Tis the natural Discharge of a vast Imagination heated in its Progress and giving itself vent in this Crowd of Images  I cannot close the Notes upon this Book without observing the dreadful Idea of  Archilles  which the Poet leaves upon the Mind of the Reader He drives his Chariot over Shields and mangled Heaps of Slain The Wheels the Axletree and the Horses are stain'd with Blood the Hero's Eyes burn with Fury and his Hands are red with Slaughter A Painter might form from this Passage the Picture of  Mars  in the Fulness of his Terrors as well as  Phidias  is said to have drawn from another that of  Jupiter  in all his Majesty  THE TWENTYFIRST BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Battel in the River  Scamander  THE  Trojans  fly before  Achilles  some towards the Town others to the River  Scamander  He falls upon the latter with great slaughter takes twelve captives alive to sacrifice to the Manes of  Patroclus  and kills  Lycaon  and  Asteropaeus Scamander  attacks him with all his waves  Neptune  and  Pallas  assist the Hero  Simois  joins  Scamander  at length  Vulcan  by the instigation of  Juno  almost dries up the River This Combate ended the other Gods engage each other Meanwhile  Achilles  continues the slaughter drives the rest into  Troy Agenor  only makes a stand and is convey'd away in a cloud by  Apollo  who to delude  Achilles  takes upon him  Agenor  's shape and while he pursues him in that disguise gives the  Trojans  an opportunity of retiring into their City  The same Day continues The Scene is on the Banks and in the Stream of  Scamander  THE TWENTYFIRST BOOK OF THE ILIAD  AND now to  Xanthus'  gliding Stream they drove  Xanthus  Immortal Progeny of  Jove  The River here divides the flying Train  Part to the Town fly diverse o'er the Plain  Where late their Troops triumphant bore the Fight  Now chac'd and trembling in ignoble flight  These with a gather'd Mist  Saturnia  shrouds  And rolls behind the Rout a Heap of Clouds  Part plunge into the Stream Old  Xanthus  roars  The flashing Billows beat the whiten'd Shores  With Cries promiscuous all the Banks resound  And here and there in Eddies whirling round  The flouncing Steeds and shrieking Warriors drown'd  As the scorch'd Locusts from their Fields retire  While fast behind them runs the Blaze of Fire  Driv'n from the Land before the smoky Cloud  The clust'ring Legions rush into the Flood  So plung'd in  Xanthus  by  Achilles'  Force  Roars the resounding Surge with Men and Horse  His bloody Lance the Hero casts aside  Which spreading Tam'risks on the Margin hide  Then like a God the rapid Billows braves  Arm'd with his Sword highbrandish'd o'er the Waves  Now down he plunges now he whirls it round  Deep groan the Waters with the dying Sound  Repeated Wounds the red'ning River dy'd  And the warm Purple circled on the Tyde  Swift thro' the foamy Flood the  Trojans  fly  And close in Rocks or winding Caverns lye  So the huge  Dolphin  tempesting the Main  In Shoals before him fly the scaly Train  Confus'dly heap'd they seek their inmost Caves  Or pant and heave beneath the floating Waves  Now tir'd with Slaughter from the  Trojan  Band  Twelve chosen Youths he drags alive to Land  With their rich Belts their Captive Arms constrains  Late their proud Ornaments but now their Chains  These his Attendants to the Ships convey'd  Sad Victims destin'd to  Patroclus'  Shade  Then as once more he plung'd amid the Flood  The young  Lycaon  in his Passage stood  The Son of  Priam  whom the Hero's Hand  But late made captive in his Father's Land  As on a Figtree Top his sounding Steel  Lopp'd the green Arms to spoke a Chariot Wheel  To  Lemnos'  Isle he sold the Royal Slave  Where  Jason  's Son the Price demanded gave  But kind  Eëtion  touching on the Shore  The ransom'd Prince to fair  Arisbe  bore  Ten Days were past since in his Father's Reign  He felt the Sweets of Liberty again  The next that God whom Men in vain withstand  Gives the same Youth to the same conqu'ring Hand  Now never to return and doom'd to go  A sadder Journey to the Shades below  His wellknown Face when great  Achilles  ey'd  The Helm and Vizor he had cast aside  With wild Affright and dropt upon the Field  His useless Lance and unavailing Shield  As trembling panting from the Stream he fled  And knock'd his fault'ring Knees the Hero said  Ye mighty Gods what Wonders strike my View  Is it in vain our conqu'ring Arms subdue  Sure I shall see yon' Heaps of  Trojans  kill'd  Rise from the Shades and brave me on the Field  As now the Captive whom so late I bound  And sold to  Lemnos  stalks on  Trojan  Ground  Not him the Seas unmeasur'd Deeps detain  That barr such numbers from their native Plain  Lo he returns Try then my flying spear  Try if the Grave can hold the Wanderer  If Earth at length this active Prince can seize  Earth whose strong Grasp has held down  Hercules  Thus while he spake the  Trojan  pale with Fears  Approach'd and sought his Knees with suppliant Tears  Loth as he was to yield his youthful Breath  And his Soul shiv'ring at th' Approach of Death  Achilles  rais'd the Spear prepar'd to wound  He kiss'd his Feet extended on the Ground  And while above the Spear suspended stood  Longing to dip its thristy Point in Blood  One Hand embrac'd them close one stopt the Dart  While thus these melting Words attempt his Heart  Thy wellknown Captive great  Achilles  see  Once more  Lycaon  trembling at thy Knee  Some Pity to a Suppliant's Name afford  Who shar'd the Gifts of  Ceres  at thy Board  Whom late thy conqu'ring Arm to  Lemnos  bore  Far from his Father Friends and native Shore  A hundred Oxen were his Price that Day  Now Sums immense thy Mercy shall repay  Scarce respited from Woes I yet appear  And scarce twelve morning Suns have seen me here  Lo  Jove  again submits me to thy Hands  Again her Victim cruel Fate demands  I sprung from  Priam  and  Laothoe  fair  Old  Alte's  Daughter and  Lelegia  's Heir  Who held in  Pedasus  his fam'd Abode  And rul'd

shall I fly  Some Daemon urges 'tis my Doom to die  If ever yet soft Pity touch'd thy mind  Ah think not me too much of  Hector  's Kind  Not the same Mother gave thy Suppliant Breath  With his who wrought thy lov'd  Patroclus'  Death  These Words attended with a Show'r of Tears  The Youth addrest to unrelenting Ears  Talk not of Life or Ransom he replies  Patroclus  dead whoever meets me dies  In vain a single  Trojan  sues for Grace  But least the Sons of  Priam  's hateful Race  Die then my Friend what boots it to deplore  The great the good  Patroclus  is no more  He far thy Better was foredoom'd to die  "And thou dost thou bewail Mortality  See'st thou not me whom Nature's Gifts adorn  Sprung from a Hero from a Goddess born  The Day shall come which nothing can avert  When by the

Thy bloated Corse and suck thy goary Wound  There no sad Mother shall thy Fun'rals weep  But swift  Scamander  roll thee to the Deep  Whose ev'ry Wave some wat'ry Monster brings  To feast unpunish'd on the Fat of Kings  So perish  Troy  and all the  Trojan  Line  Such Ruin theirs and such Compassion mine  What boots ye now  Scamander  's worship'd Stream  His earthly Honours and immortal Name  In vain your immolated Bulls are slain  Your living Coursers glut his Gulphs in vain  Thus he rewards you with this bitter Fate  Thus till the  Grecian  Vengeance is compleat  Thus is aton'd  Patroclus  honour'd Shade  And the short Absence of  Achilles  paid  These boastful Words provoke the raging God  With Fury swells the violated Flood  What Means divine may yet the Pow'r employ  To check  Achilles  and to rescue  Troy  Meanwhile the Hero springs in Arms to dare  The great  Asteropeus  to mortal War  The Son of  Pelagon  whose lofty Line  Flows from the Source of  Axius  Stream divine  Fair  Peribaea  's Love the God had crown'd  With all his refluent Waters circled round  On him  Achilles  rush'd He fearless stood  And shook two Spears advancing from the Flood  The Flood impell'd him on  Pelides'  Head  T'avenge his Waters choak'd with Heaps of Dead  Near as they drew  Achilles  thus began  What art thou boldest of the Race of Man  Who or from whence Unhappy is the Sire  Whose Son encounters our resistless Ire  O Son of  Peleus  what avails to trace  Reply'd the Warrior our illustrious Race  From rich  Paeonia  's Vallies I command  Arm'd with protended Spears my native Band  Now shines the tenth bright Morning since I came  In aid of  Ilion  to the Fields of Fame  Axius  who swells with all the neighb'ring Rills  And wide around the floated Region fills  Begot my Sire whose Spear such Glory won  Now lift thy Arm and try that Hero's Son  Threat'ning he said The hostile Chiefs advance  At once  Asteropeus  discharg'd each Lance  For both his dext'rous Hands the Lance cou'd wield  One struck but pierc'd not the  Vulcanian  Shield  One raz'd  Achilles  Hand the spouting Blood  Spun forth in Earth the fasten'd Weapon stood  Like Lightning next the  Pelian  Jav'lin flies  Its erring Fury hiss'd along the Skies  Deep in the swelling Bank was driv'n the Spear  Ev'n to the middle earth'd and quiver'd there  Then from his side the Sword  Pelides  drew  And on his Foe with doubled Fury flew  The Foe thrice tugg'd and shook the rooted Wood  Repulsive of his Might the Weapon stood  The fourth he tries to break the Spear in vain  Bent as he stands he tumbles to the Plain  His Belly open'd with a ghastly Wound  The reeking Entrails pour upon the Ground  Beneath the Hero's Feet he panting lies  And his Eye darkens and his Spirit flies  While the proud Victor thus triumphing said  His radiant Armour tearing from the Dead  So ends thy Glory Such the Fate they prove  Who strive presumptuous with the Sons of  Jove  Sprung from a River didst thou boast thy Line  But great  Saturnius  is the Source of mine  How durst thou vaunt thy wat'ry Progeny  Of  Peleus Aeacus  and  Jove  am I  The Race of these superior far to those  As he that thunders to the Stream that flows  What Rivers can  Scamander  might have shown  But  Jove  he dreads nor wars against his Son  Ev'n  Achelöus  might contend in vain  And all the roaring Billows of the Main  Th'Eternal Ocean from whose Fountains flow  The Seas the Rivers and the Springs below  The thund'ring Voice of  Jove  abhors to hear  And in his deep Abysses shakes with Fear  He said then from the Bank his Jav'lin tore  And left the breathless Warrior in his Gore  The floating Tydes the bloody Carcass lave  And beat against it Wave succeeding Wave  Till roll'd between the Banks it lies the Food  Of curling Eels and Fishes of the Flood  All scatter'd round the Stream their Mightiest slain  Th'amaz'd  Paeonians  scour along the Plain  He vents his Fury on the flying Crew  Thrasius Astypylus  and  Mnesus  slew  Mydon Thersilochus  with  Aenius  fell  And Numbers more his Lance had plung'd to Hell  But from the Bottom of his Gulphs profound  Scamander  spoke the Shores return'd the Sound  O first of Mortals for the Gods are thine  In Valour matchless and in Force divine  If  Jove  have giv'n thee every  Trojan  Head  'Tis not on me thy Rage should heap the Dead  See my choak'd Streams no more their Course can keep  Nor roll their wonted Tribute to the Deep  Turn then Impetuous from our injur'd Flood  Content thy Slaughters could amaze a God  In human Form confess'd before his Eyes  The River thus and thus the Chief replies  O sacred Stream thy Word we shall obey  But not till  Troy  the destin'd Vengeance pay  Not till within her Tow'rs the perjur'd Train  Shall pant and tremble at our Arms again  Not till proud  Hector  Guardian of her Wall  Or stain this Lance or see  Achilles  fall  He said and drove with Fury on the Foe  Then to the Godhead of the silver Bow  The yellow Flood began O Son of  Jove  Was not the Mandate of the Sire above  Full and express that  Phoebus  should employ  His sacred Arrows in defence of  Troy  And make her conquer till  Hyperion  's Fall  In awful Darkness hide the Face of all  He spoke in vainThe Chief without Dismay  Ploughs thro' the boiling Surge his desp'rate Way  Then rising in his Rage above the Shores  From all his Deeps the bellowing River roars  Huge Heaps of Slain disgorges on the Coast  And round the Banks the ghastly Dead are tost  While all before the Billows rang'd on high  A wat'ry Bulwark screen the Bands who fly  Now bursting on his Head with thund'ring Sound  The falling Deluge whelms the Hero round  His loaded Shield bends to the rushing Tide  His Feet upborn scarce the strong Flood divide  Slidd'ring and stagg'ring On the Border stood  A spreading Elm that overhung the Flood  He seiz'd a bending Bough his Steps to stay  The Plant uprooted to his Weight gave way  Heaving the Bank and undermining all  Loud flash the Waters to the rushing Fall  Of the thick Foliage The large Trunk display'd  Bridg'd the rough Flood across The Hero stay'd  On this his Weight and rais'd upon his Hand  Leap'd from the Chanel and regain'd the Land  Then blacken'd the wild Waves the Murmur rose  The God pursues a huger Billow throws  And bursts the Bank ambitious to destroy  The Man whose Fury is the Fate of  Troy  He like the warlike Eagle speeds his Pace  Swiftest and strongest of th'aerial Race  Far as a Spear can fly  Achilles  springs  At every Bound His clanging Armour rings  Now here now there he turns on ev'ry side  And winds his Course before the following Tide  The Waves flow after wheresoe'er he wheels  And gather fast and murmur at his Heels  So when a Peasant to his Garden brings  Soft Rills of Water from the bubbling Springs  And calls the Floods from high to bless his Bow'rs  And feed with pregnant Streams the Plants and Flow'rs  Soon as he clears whate'er their passage staid  And marks their future Current with his Spade  Swift o'er the rolling Pebbles down the Hills  Louder and louder purl the falling Rills  Before him scatt'ring they prevent his pains  And shine in mazy Wand'rings o'er the Plains  Still flies  Achilles  but before his eyes  Still swift  Scamander  rolls where'er he flies  Not all his Speed escapes the rapid Floods  The first of Men but not a Match for Gods  Oft' as he turn'd the Torrent to oppose  And bravely try if all the Pow'rs were Foes  So oft' the Surge in wat'ry Mountains spread  Beats on his Back or bursts upon his Head  Yet dauntless still the adverse Flood he braves  And still indignant bounds above the Waves  Tir'd by the Tides his Knees relax with Toil  Wash'd from beneath him slides the slimy Soil  When thus his Eyes on Heav'ns Expansion thrown  Forth bursts the Hero with an angry Groan  Is there no God  Achilles  to befriend  No Pow'r t'avert his miserable End  Prevent oh  Jove  this ignominious Date  And make my future Life the Sport of Fate  Of all Heav'ns Oracles believ'd in vain  But most of  Thetis  must her Son complain  By  Phoebus'  Darts she prophesy'd my Fall  In glorious Arms before the  Trojan  Wall  Oh had I dy'd in Fields of Battel warm  Stretch'd like a Hero by a Hero's Arm  Might  Hector  's Spear this dauntless Bosom rend  And my swift Soul o'ertake my slaughter'd Friend  Ah no  Achilles  meets a shameful Fate  Oh how unworthy of the Brave and Great  Like some vile Swain whom on a rainy Day  Crossing a Ford the Torrent sweeps away  An unregarded Carcase to the Sea  Neptune  and  Pallas  haste to his Relief  And thus in human Form address the Chief  The Pow'r of Ocean first Forbear thy Fear  O Son of  Peleus  Lo thy Gods appear  Behold from  Jove  descending to thy Aid  Propitious  Neptune  and the blueey'd Maid  Stay and the furious Flood shall cease to rave  Tis not thy Fate to glut his angry Wave  But thou the Counsel Heav'n suggests attend  Nor breathe from Combate nor thy Sword suspend  Till  Troy  receive her flying Sons till all  Her routed Squadrons pant behind their Wall  Hector  alone shall stand his fatal Chance  And  Hector  's Blood shall smoke upon thy Lance  Thine is the Glory doom'd Thus spake the Gods  Then swift ascended to the bright Abodes  Stung with new Ardor thus by Heav'n impell'd  He springs impetuous and invades the Field  O'er all th'expanded Plain the Waters spread  Heav'd on the bounding Billows danc'd the Dead  Floating midst scatter'd Arms while Casques of Gold  And turn'd up Bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd  High o'er the surging Tide by Leaps and Bounds  He wades and mounts the parted Wave resounds  Not a whole River stops the Hero's Course  While  Pallas  fills him with immortal Force  With equal Rage indignant  Xanthus  roars  And lifts his Billows and o'erwhelms his Shores  Then thus to  Simois  Haste my Brother Flood  And check this Mortal that controuls a God  Our bravest Heroes else shall quit the Fight  And  Ilion  tumble from her tow'ry Height  Call then thy subject Streams and bid them roar  From all thy Fountains swell thy wat'ry Store  With broken Rocks and with a Load of Dead  Charge the black Surge and pour it on his Head  Mark how resistless thro' the Floods he goes  And boldly bids the warring Gods be Foes  But nor that Force nor Form divine to Sight  Shall ought avail him if our Rage unite  Whelm'd under our dark Gulphs those Arms shall lie  That blaze so dreadful in each  Trojan  Eye  And deep beneath a sandy Mountain hurl'd  Immers'd remain this Terror of the World  Such pond'rous Ruin shall confound the Place  No  Greek  shall e'er his perish'd Relicks grace  No Hand his Bones shall gather or inhume  These his cold Rites and this his wat'ry Tomb  He said and on the Chief descends amain  Increas'd with Gore and swelling with the Slain  Then murm'ring from his Beds he boils he raves  And a Foam whitens on the purple Waves  At ev'ry Step before  Achilles  stood  The crimson Surge and delug'd him with Blood  Fear touch'd the Queen of Heav'n She saw dismay'd  She call'd aloud and summon'd  Vulcan  's Aid  Rise to the War th'insulting Flood requires  Thy wasteful Arm Assemble all thy Fires  While to their aid by our Command enjoin'd  Rush the swift Eastern and the Western Wind  These from old Ocean at my Word shall blow  Pour the red Torrent on the wat'ry Foe  Corses and Arms to one bright Ruin turn  And hissing Rivers to their bottoms burn  Go mighty in thy Rage display thy Pow'r  Drink the whole Flood the crackling Trees devour  Scorch all the Banks and till our Voice reclaim  Exert th'unweary'd Furies of the Flame  The Pow'r Ignipotent her Word obeys  Wide o'er the Plain he pours the boundless Blaze  At once consumes the Dead and dries the Soil  And the shrunk Waters in their Chanel boil  As when Autumnal  Boreas  sweeps the Sky  And instant blows the water'd Garden dry  So look'd the Field so whiten'd was the Ground  While  Vulcan  breath'd the fiery Blast around  Swift on the sedgy Reeds the Ruin preys  Along the Margin winds the running Blaze  The Trees in flaming rows to Ashes turn  The flow'ry  Lotos  and the Tam'risk burn  Broad Elm and Cypress rising in a Spire  The wat'ry Willows hiss before the Fire  Now glow the Waves the Fishes pant for Breath  The Eels lie twisting in the Pangs of Death  Now flounce aloft now dive the scaly Fry  Or gasping turn their Bellies to the Sky  At length the River rear'd his languid Head  And thus shortpanting to the God he said  O  Vulcan  oh what Pow'r resists thy Might  I faint I sink unequal to the Fight  I yieldLet  Ilion  fall if Fate decree  Ahbend no more thy fiery Arms on me  He ceas'd wide Conflagration blazing round  The bubbling Waters yield a hissing Sound  As when the Flames beneath a Caldron rise  To melt the Fat of some rich Sacrifice  Amid the fierce Embrace of circling Fires  The Waters foam the heavy Smoak aspires  So boils th' imprison'd Flood forbid to flow  And choak'd with Vapours feels his Bottom glow  To  Juno  then Imperial Queen of Air  The burning River sends his earnest Pray'r  Ah why  Saturnia  must thy Son engage  Me only me with all his wastfull Rage  On other Gods his dreadful Arm employ  For mightier Gods assert the Cause of  Troy  Submissive I desist if thou command  But ah withdraw this alldestroying Hand  Hear then my solemn Oath to yield to Fate  Unaided  Ilion  and her destin'd State  Till  Greece  shall gird her with destructive Flame  And in one Ruin sink the  Trojan  Name  His warm Intreaty touch'd  Saturnia  's Ear  She bade th'Ignipotent his Rage forbear  Recall the Flame nor in a mortal cause  Infest a God Th'obedient Flame withdraws  Again the branching Streams begin to spread  And soft remurmur in their wonted Bed  While these by  Juno  's Will the Strife resign  The warring Gods in fierce Contention join  Rekindling Rage each heavenly Breast alarms  With horrid Clangor shock th'aetherial Arms  Heav'n in loud Thunder bids the Trumpet sound  And wide beneath them groans the rending Ground  Jove  as his Sport the dreadful Scene descries  And views contending Gods with careless Eyes  The Pow'r of Battels lifts his brazen Spear  And first assaults the radiant Queen of War  What mov'd thy Madness thus to disunite  Aethereal Minds and mix all Heav'n in Fight  What wonder this when in thy frantick Mood  Thou drov'st a Mortal to insult a God  Thy impious Hand  Tydides'  Jav'lin bore  And madly bath'd it in celestial Gore  He spoke and smote the loudresounding Shield  Which bears  Jove  's Thunder on its dreadful Field  The Adamantine  Aegis  of her Sire  That turns the glancing Bolt and forked Fire  Then heav'd the Goddess in her mighty Hand  A Stone the Limit of the neighb'ring Land  There fix'd from eldest times black craggy vast  This at the heav'nly Homicide she cast  Thund'ring he falls a Mass of monstrous Size  And sev'n broad Acres covers as he lies  The stunning Stroke his stubborn Nerves unbound  Loud o'er the Fields his ringing Arms resound  The scornful Dame her Conquest views with Smiles  And glorying thus the prostrate God reviles  Hast thou not yet insatiate Fury known  How far  Minerva  's Force transcends thy own  Juno  whom thou rebellious dar'st withstand  Corrects thy Folly thus by  Pallas'  Hand  Thus meets thy broken Faith with just Disgrace  And partial Aid to  Troy  's perfidious Race  The Goddess spoke and turn'd her Eyes away  That beaming round diffus'd celestial Day  Jove  's  Cyprian  Daughter stooping on the Land  Lent to the wounded God her tender Hand  Slowly he rises scarcely breathes with Pain  And propt on her fair Arm forsakes the Plain  This the bright Empress of the Heav'ns survey'd  And scoffing thus to War's victorious Maid  Lo what an Aid on  Mars  's Side is seen  The  Smiles  and  Love's  unconquerable Queen  Mark with what Insolence in open view  She moves Let  Pallas  if she dares pursue  Minerva  smiling heard the Pair o'ertook  And slightly on her Breast the Wanton strook  She unresisting fell her Spirits fled  On Earth together lay the Lovers spread  And like these Hero's be the Fate of all    Minerva  cries who guard the  Trojan  Wall  To  Grecian  Gods such let the  Phrygian  be  So dread so fierce as  Venus  is to me  Then from the lowest Stone shall  Troy  be mov'd  Thus she and  Juno  with a Smile approv'd  Meantime to mix in more than mortal Fight  The God of Ocean dares the God of Light  What Sloath has seiz'd us when the Fields around  Ring with conflicting Pow'rs and Heav'n returns the Sound  Shall ignominious We with shame retire  No Deed perform'd to our  Olympian  Sire  Come prove thy Arm for first the War to wage  Suits not my Greatness or superior Age  Rash as thou art to prop the  Trojan  Throne  Forgetful of my Wrongs and of thy own  And guard the Race of proud  Laomedon  Hast thou forgot how at the Monarch's Pray'r  We shar'd the lengthen'd Labours of a Year  Troy  Walls I rais'd for such were  Jove  's Commands  And yon' proud Bulwarks grew beneath my Hands  Thy Task it was to feed the bellowing Droves  Along fair  Ida  's Vales and pendent Groves  But when the circling Seasons in their Train  Brought back the grateful Day that crown'd our Pain  With Menace stern the fraudful King defy'd  Our latent Godhead and the Prize deny'd  Mad as he was he threaten'd servile Bands  And doom'd us Exiles far in barb'rous Lands  Incens'd we heav'nward fled with swiftest wing  And destin'd Vengeance on the perjur'd King  Dost thou for this afford proud  Ilion  Grace  And not like us infest the faithless Race  Like us their present future Sons destroy  And from its deep Foundations heave their  Troy  Apollo  thus To combat for Mankind  Ill suits the Wisdom of celestial Mind  For what is Man Calamitous by Birth  They owe their Life and Nourishment to Earth  Like yearly Leaves that now with Beauty crown'd  Smile on the Sun now wither on the Ground  To their own Hands commit the frantick Scene  Nor mix Immortals in a Cause so mean  Then turns his Face farbeaming heav'nly Fires  And from the Senior Pow'r submiss retires  Him thus retreating  Artemis  upbraids  The quiver'd Huntress of the  Sylvan  Shades  And is it thus the youthful  Phoebus  flies  And yields to Ocean's hoary Sire the Prize  How vain that martial Pomp and dreadful Show  Of pointed Arrows and the silver Bow  Now boast no more in yon' celestial Bow'r  Thy Force can match the great Earthshaking Pow'r  Silent he heard the Queen of Woods upbraid  Not so  Saturnia  bore the vaunting Maid  But furious thus What Insolence has driv'n  Thy Pride to face the Majesty of Heav'n  What tho' by  Jove  the female Plague design'd  Fierce to the feeble Race of Womankind  The wretched Matron feels thy piercing Dart  Thy Sexe's Tyrant with a Tyger's Heart  What tho' tremendous in the woodland Chase  Thy certain Arrows pierce the savage Race  How dares thy Rashness on the Pow'rs divine  Employ those Arms or match thy Force with mine  Learn hence no more unequal War to wage  She said and seiz'd her Wrists with eager Rage  These in her LeftHand lock'd her Right unty'd  The Bow the Quiver and its plumy Pride  About her Temples flies the busy Bow  Now here now there she winds her from the Blow  The scatt'ring Arrows rattling from the Case  Drop round and idly mark the dusty Place  Swift from the Field the baffled Huntress flies  And scarce restrains the Torrent in her Eyes  So when the Falcon wings her way above  To the cleft Cavern speeds the gentle Dove  Not fated yet to die There safe retreats  Yet still her Heart against the Marble beats  To her  Latona  hasts with tender Care  Whom  Hermes  viewing thus declines the War  How shall I face the Dame who gives Delight  To him whose Thunders blacken Heav'n with Night  Go matchless Goddess triumph in the Skies  And boast my Conquest while I yeild the Prize  He spoke and past  Latona  stooping low  Collects the scatter'd Shafts and fallen Bow  That glitt'ring on the Dust lay here and there  Dishonour'd Relicks of  Diana's  War  Then swift pursu'd her to the blest Abode  Where all confus'd she sought the Sov'reign God  Weeping she grasp'd his Knees Th' Ambrosial Vest  Shook with her Sighs and panted on her Breast  The Sire superior smil'd and bade her show  What heav'nly Hand had caus'd his Daughter's Woe  Abash'd she names his own Imperial Spouse  And the pale Crescent fades upon her Brows  Thus they above While swiftly gliding down  Apollo  enters  Ilion  's sacred Town  The Guardian God now trembled for her Wall  And fear'd the  Greeks  tho' Fate forbade her Fall  Back to  Olympus  from the War's Alarms  Return the shining Bands of Gods in Arms  Some proud in Triumph some with Rage on fire  And take their Thrones around th'Aethereal Sire  Thro' Blood thro'Death  Achilles  still proceeds  O'er slaughter'd Heroes and o'er rolling Steeds  As when avenging Flames with Fury driv'n  On guilty Towns exert the Wrath of Heav'n  The Pale Inhabitants some fall some fly  And the red Vapours purple all the Sky  So rag'd  Achilles  Death and dire Dismay  And Toils and Terrors fill'd the dreadful Day  High on a Turret hoary  Priam  stands  And marks the Waste of his destructive Hands  Views from his Arm the  Trojans  scatter'd Flight  And the near Hero rising on his Sight  No Stop no Check no Aid With feeble pace  And settled Sorrow on his aged Face  Fast as he could he sighing quits the Walls  And thus descending on the Guards he calls  You to whose care our City Gates belong  Set wide your Portals to the flying Throng  For lo he comes with unresisted Sway  He comes and Desolation marks his way  But when within the Walls our Troops take Breath  Lock fast the brazen Bars and shut out Death  Thus charg'd the rev'rend Monarch Wide were flung  The opening Folds the sounding Hinges rung  Phoebus  rush'd forth the flying Bands to meet  Strook Slaughter back and cover'd the Retreat  On Heaps the  Trojans  crowd to gain the Gate  And gladsome see their last Escape from Fate  Thither all parch'd with Thirst a heartless Train  Hoary with Dust they beat the hollow Plain  And gasping panting fainting labour on  With heavier Strides that lengthen tow'rd the Town  Enrag'd  Achilles  follows with his Spear  Wild with Revenge insatiable of War  Then had the  Greeks  Eternal Praise acquir'd  And  Troy  inglorious to her Walls retir'd  But  Apollo  he the God who darts aethereal Flame  Shot down to save her and redeem her Fame  To young  Agenor  Force divine he gave    Antenor  's Offspring haughty bold and brave  In aid of him beside the Beech he sate  And wrapt in Clouds restrain'd the Hand of Fate  When now the gen'rous Youth  Achilles  spies  Thick beats his Heart the troubled Motions rise  So e're a Storm the Waters heave and roll  He stops and questions thus his mighty Soul  What shall I fly this Terror of the Plain  Like others fly and be like others slain  Vain hope to shun him by the selfsame Road  Yon' Line of slaughter'd  Trojans  lately trod  No with the common Heap I scorn to fall  What if they pass'd me to the  Trojan  Wall  While I decline to yonder Path that leads  To  Ida  's Forests and surrounding Shades  So may I reach conceal'd the cooling Flood  From my tir'd Body wash the Dust and Blood  As soon as Night her dusky Veil extends  Return in safety to my  Trojan  Friends  What ifBut wherefore all this vain Debate  Stand I to doubt within the reach of Fate  Ev'n now perhaps e'er yet I turn the Wall  The fierce  Achilles  sees me and I fall  Such is his Swiftness 'tis in vain to fly  And such his Valour that who stands must die  Howe'er 'tis better fighting for the State  Here and in publick view to meet my Fate  Yet sure He too is mortal He may feel  Like all the Sons of Earth the Force of Steel  One only Soul informs that dreadful Frame  And  Jove  's sole Favour gives him all his Fame  He said and stood collected in his Might  And all his beating Bosom claim'd the Fight  So from some deepgrown Wood a Panther starts  Rouz'd from his Thicket by a Storm of Darts  Untaught to fear or fly he hears the Sounds  Of shouting Hunters and of clam'rous Hounds  Tho' strook tho' wounded scarce perceives the Pain  And the barb'd Jav'lin stings his Breast in vain  On their whole War untam'd the Savage flies  And tears his Hunter or beneath him dies  Not less resolv'd  Antenor  's valiant Heir  Confronts  Achilles  and awaits the War  Disdainful of Retreat Highheld before  His Shield a broad Circumference he bore  Then graceful as he stood in act to throw  The lifted Jav'lin thus bespoke the Foe  How proud  Achilles  glories in his Fame  And hopes this day to sink the  Trojan  Name  Beneath her Ruins Know that Hope is vain  A thousand Woes a thousand Toils remain  Parents and Children our just Arms employ  And strong and many are the Sons of  Troy  Great as thou art ev'n thou may'st stain with Gore  These  Phrygian  Fields and press a foreign Shore  He said With matchless Force the Jav'lin flung  Smote on his Knee the hollow Cuishes rung  Beneath the pointed Steel but safe from Harms  He stands impassive in th' Aethereal Arms  Then fiercely rushing on the daring Foe  His lifted Arm prepares the fatal Blow  But jealous of his Fame  Apollo  shrouds  The godlike  Trojan  in a Veil of Clouds  Safe from Pursuit and shut from mortal View  Dismiss'd with Fame the favour'd Youth withdrew  Meanwhile the God to cover their Escape  Assumes  Agenor  's Habit Voice and Shape  Flies from the furious Chief in this Disguise  The furious Chief still follows where he flies  Now o'er the Fields they stretch with lengthen'd Strides  Now urge the Course where swift  Scamander  glides  The God now distant scarce a Stride before  Tempts his Pursuit and wheels about the Shore  While all the flying Troops their Speed employ  And pour on Heaps into the Walls of  Troy  No stop no stay no thought to ask or tell  Who scap'd by Flight or who by Battel fell  'Twas Tumult all and Violence of Flight  And sudden Joy confus'd and mix'd Affright  Pale  Troy  against  Achilles  shuts her Gate  And Nations breathe deliver'd from their Fate  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TwentyFirst Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TWENTYFIRST BOOK  I  THIS Book is entirely different from all the foregoing Tho' it be a Battel it is entirely of a new and surprizing kind diversify'd with a vast Variety of Imagery and Description The Scene is totally chang'd he paints the Combate of his Hero with the Rivers and describes a Battel amidst an Inundation It is observable that tho' the whole War of the Iliad was upon the Banks of these Rivers  Homer  has artfully left out the Machinery of RiverGods in all the other Battels to aggrandize this of his Hero There is no Book of the Poem that has more force of Imagination or in which the great and inexhausted Invention of our Author is more powerfully exerted After this Description of an Inundation there follows a very beautiful Contrast in that of the Drought The Part of  Achilles  is admirably sustain'd and the new Strokes which  Homer  gives to his Picture are such as are deriv'd from the very source of his Character and finish the entire Draught of this Hero  How far all that appears wonderful or extravagant in this Episode may be reconcil'd to Probability Truth and natural  Reason will be consider'd in a distinct Note on that Head The Reader may find it on ℣  II  VERSE Xanthus  immortal Progeny of  Jove  The River is here said to be the Son of  Jupiter  on account of its being supply'd with Waters that fall from  Jupiter  that is from Heaven  Eustathius  III  VERSE  As the scorch'd Locusts  c  Eustathius  observes that several Countries have been much infested with Armies of Locusts and that to prevent their destroying the Fruits of the Earth the Countrymen by kindling large Fires drove them from their Fields the Locusts to avoid the intense Heat were forc'd to cast themselves into the Water From this Observation the Poet draws his Allusion which is very much to the Honour of  Achilles  since it represents the  Trojans  with respect to him as no more than so many Insects  The same Commentator takes notice that because the Island of  Cyprus  in particular was us'd to practise this Method with the Locusts some Authors have conjectur'd that  Homer  was of that Country but if this were a sufficient Reason for such a Supposition he might be said to be born in almost all the Countries of the World since he draws his Observations from the Customs of them all  We may hence account for the innumerable Armies of these Locusts mention'd among the Plagues of  Aegypt  without having recourse to an immediate Creation as some good Men have imagin'd whereas the Miracle indeed consists in the wonderful manner of bringing them upon the  Aegyptians  I have often observ'd with Pleasure the Similitude which many of  Homer  's Expressions bear with the holy Scriptures and that the oldest Writer in the World except  Moses  often speaks in the Idiom of  Moses  Thus as the Locusts in  Exodus  are said to be driven into  the Seas  so in  Homer  they are forc'd into  a River  IV  VERSE  So the huge Dolphin  c  It is observable with what Justness the Author diversifies his Comparisons according to the different Scenes and Elements he is engag'd in  Achilles  has been hitherto on the Land and compar'd to Land Animals a Lyon  c  Now he is in the Water the Poet derives his Images from thence and likens him to a Dolphin  Eustathius  V  VERSE  Now tir'd with Slaughter    This is admirably well suited to the Character of  Achilles  his Rage bears him headlong on the Enemy he kills all that oppose him and stops not till Nature itself could not keep pace with his Anger he had determin'd to reserve twelve noble Youths to sacrifice them to the  Manes  of  Patroclus  but his Resentment gives him no time to think of them till the hurry of his Passion abates and he is tir'd with Slaughter Without this Circumstance I think an Objection might naturally be rais'd that in the time of a Pursuit  Achilles  gave the Enemy too much Leisure to escape while he busy'd himself with tying these Prisoners Tho' it is not absolutely necessary to suppose he did this with his own Hands  VI  VERSE  Twelve chosen Youths    This piece of Cruelty in  Achilles  has appear'd shocking to many and indeed is what I think can only be excus'd by considering the ferocious and vindictive Spirit of this Hero 'Tis however certain that the  Cruelties exercis'd on Enemies in War were authoriz'd by the military Laws of those Times nay Religion itself became a Sanction to them It is not only the fierce  Achilles  but the pious and religious  Aeneas  whose very Character is Virtue and Compassion that reserves several young unfortunate Captives taken in Battel to sacrifice them to the  Manes  of his favourite Hero  Aen  ℣  Sulmone creatos  Quattuor hic juvenes totidem quos educat Ufens  Viventes rapit inferias quos immolet umbris  Captivoque rogi perfundat sanguine flammas  And  Aen  ℣  Vinxerat post terga manus quos mitteret umbris  Inferias caeso sparsuros sanguine flammam  And what is very particular the  Latin  Poet expresses no Disapprobation of the Action which the  Grecian  does in plain terms speaking of this in Iliad ℣    VII  VERSE  The young  Lycaon  c    Homer  has a wonderful Art and Judgment in contriving such Incidents as set the characteristick Qualities of his Heroes in the highest point of Light There is hardly any in the whole Iliad more proper to move Pity than this Circumstance of  Lycaon  or to raise Terror than this View of  Achilles  It is also the finest Picture of them both imaginable We see the different Attitude of their Persons and the different Passions which appear'd in their Countenances At first  Achilles  stands erect with Surprize in his Looks at the Sight of one whom he thought it impossible to find there while  Lycaon  is in the Posture of a Suppliant with Looks that plead for Compassion  with one Hand holding the Hero's Lance and his Knee with theother Afterwards when at his Death he lets go the Spear and places himself on his Knees with his Arms extended to receive the mortal Wound how lively and how strongly is this painted I believe every one perceives the Beauty of this Passage and allows that Poetry at least in  Homer  is truly a speaking Picture  VIII  VERSE  c The Speeches of  Lycaon  and  Achilles  It is impossible for any thing to be better imagin'd than these two Speeches that of  Lycaon  is moving and compassionate that of  Achilles  haughty and dreadful the one pleads with the utmost Tenderness the other denies with the utmost Sternness One would think it impossible to amass so many moving Arguments in so few Words as those of  Lycaon  He forgets no Circumstance to soften his Enemy's Anger he flatters the Memory of  Patroclus  is afraid of being thought too nearly related to  Hector  and would willingly put himself upon him as a Suppliant and consequently as an inviolable person But  Achilles  is immoveable his Resentment makes him deaf to Entreaties and it must be remember'd that Anger not Mercy is his Character  I must confess I could have wish'd  Achilles  had spared him There are so many Circumstances that speak in his Favour that he deserv'd his Life had he not ask'd it in Terms a little too abject  There is an Air of Greatness in the Conclusion of the Speech of  Achilles  which strikes me very much He speaks very unconcernedly of his own Death and upbraids his Enemy for asking Life so earnestly a Life that was of so much less Importance than his own  IX  VERSE  The Day shall come  When by the Spear the Arrow or the Dart  This is not spoken at random but with an Air of Superiority  when  Achilles  says he shall fall by an Arrow a Dart or a Spear he insinuates that no Man will have the Courage to approach him in a close Fight or engage him Hand to Hand  Eustathius  X  VERSE  Your living Coursers glut his Gulphs in vain    It was an ancient Custom to cast living Horses into the Sea and into Rivers to honour as it were by these Victims the Rapidity of their Streams This Practice continued a long time and History supplies us with Examples of it  Aurelius Victor  says of  Pompey  the younger  Cùm mari feliciter uteretur  Neptuni  se filium confessus est eumque bobus auratis equo placavit  He offer'd Oxen in Sacrifice and threw a living Horse into the Sea as appears from  Dion  which is perfectly conformable to this of  Homer Eustath Dacier  XI  VERSE  With Fury swells the violated Flood    The Poet has been preparing us for the Episode of the River  Xanthus  ever since the Beginning of the last Book and here he gives us an account why the River wars upon  Achilles  It is not only because he is a River of  Troas  but as  Eustathius  remarks because it is in defence of a Man that was descended from a BrotherRiver God He was angry too with  Achilles  on another account because he had choak'd up his Current with the Bodies of his Countreymen the  Trojans  XII  VERSE  From rich  Paeonia  'sc    In the Catalogue  Pyraechmes  is said to be Commander of the  Paeonians  where they are describ'd as BowMen but here they are said to be arm'd with Spears and to have  Asteropaens  for their General  Eustathius  tells us some Criticks asserted that this Line in the  Cat  ℣  followed  but I see no reason for such an Assertion  Homer  has expressly told us in this Speech that it was but ten Days since he came to the Aid of  Troy  he might be made General of the  Paeonians  upon the Death of  Pyraechmes  who was kill'd in the sixteenth Book Why also might not the  Paeonians  as well as  Teucer  excel in the Management both of the Bow and the Spear  XIII  VERSE  Deep in the swelling Bank was driv'n the Spear  Ev'n to the middle earth'd    It was impossible for the Poet to give us a greater Idea of the Strength of  Achilles  than he has by this Circumstance His Spear peirc'd so deep into the Ground that another Hero of great Strength could not disengage it by repeated Efforts but immediately after  Achilles  draws it with the utmost Ease How prodigious was the Force of that Arm that could drive at one throw a Spear half way into the Earth and then with a touch release it  XIV  VERSE  Now bursting on his Head  c  There is a great Beauty in the Versification of this whole Passage in  Homer  Some of the Verses run hoarse full and sonorous like the Torrent they describe others by their broken Cadences and sudden Stops image the Difficulty Labour and Interruption of the Hero's March against it The fall of the Elm the tearing up of the Bank the rushing of the Branches in the Water are all put into such Words that almost  every Letter corresponds in its Sound and echoes to the Sense of each particular  XV  VERSE  Bridg'd the rough Flood across    If we had no other account of the River  Xanthus  but this it were alone sufficient to shew that the Current could not be very wide for the Poet here says that the Elm stretch'd from Bank to Bank and as it were made a Bridge over it The Suddenness of this Inundation perfectly well agrees with a narrow River  XVI  VERSE  Leap'd from the Chanel    Eustathius  recites a Criticism on this Verse in the Original the Word  signifies  Stagnum Palus  a standingWater now this is certainly contrary to the Idea of a River which always implies a  Current  To solve this says that Author some have suppos'd that the Tree which lay across the River stopp'd the flow of the Waters and forc'd them to spread as it were into a Pool Others dissatisfy'd with this Solution think that a Mistake is crept into the Text and that instead of  should be inserted  But I do not see the Necessity of having recourse to either of these Solutions for why may not the Word  signify here the  Chanel  of the River as it evidently does in the th Verse And nothing being more common than to substitute a part for the whole why may not the Chanel be suppos'd to imply the whole River  XVII  VERSE  As when a Peasant to his Garden brings  c  This changing of the Character is very beautiful No Poet  ever knew like  Homer  to pass from the vehement and the nervous to the gentle and the agreeable such Transitions when properly made give a singular Pleasure as when in Musick a Master passes from the rough to the tender  Demetrius Phalereus  who only praises this Comparison for its Clearness has not sufficiently recommended its Beauty and Value  Virgil  has transfer'd it into his first Book of the Georgicks ℣  Deinde satis fluvium inducit rivosque sequentes  Et cùm exustus ager morientibus aestuat herbis  Ecce supercilio clivosi tramitis undam  Elicit Illa cadens raucum per levia murmur  Saxa ciet scatebris{que} arentia temperat arva  Dacier  XVIII  VERSE  Oh had I dy'd in Fields of Battel warm  c  Nothing is more agreeable than this Wish to the heroick Character of  Achilles  Glory is his prevailing Passion he grieves not that he must die but that he should die unlike a Man of Honour  Virgil  has made use of the same Thought in the same Circumstance where  Aeneas  is in danger of being drowned  Aen  ℣  O ter{que} quaterque beati  Queis ante ora patrum  Trojae  sub moenibus altis  Contigit oppetere O Danaûm fortissime gentis  Tydide mene Iliacis occumbere campis  Non potuisse tuâque animam hanc effundere dextrâ  Lucan  in the fifth Book of his  Pharsalia  representing  Caesar  in the same Circumstance has I think yet farther the Character of Ambition and a boundless Thirst of Glory in his Hero when after he has repin'd in the same manner with  Achilles  he acquiesces at last in the Reflection of the Glory he had already acquired  Licet ingentes abruperit actus  Festinata dies fatis sat magna peregi  Arctoas domui gentes inimica subegi  Arma manu vidit Magnum mihi  Roma  secundum  And only wishes that his obscure Fate might be conceal'd in the view that all the World might still fear and expect him  Lacerum retinete cadaver  Fluctibus in mediis desint mihi busta rogusque  Dum metuar semper terrâque expecter ab omni  XIX  VERSE  While  Vulcan  breath'd the fiery Blast around    It is in the Original ℣  The Epithet given to  Vulcan  in this Verse as well as in the  th    has no sort of Allusion to the Action describ'd For what has his  Wisdom  or  Knowledge  to do with burning up the River  Xanthus  This is usual in our Author and much exclaim'd against by his modern Antagonists whom Mr  Boileau  very well answers  "It is not so strange in  Homer  to give these Epithets to Persons upon occasions which can have no reference to them the same is frequent in modern Languages in which we call a Man by the Name of  Saint  when we speak of any Action of his that has not the least regard to his  Sanctity  As when we say for example that St  Paul  held the Garments of those who stoned St  Stephen  XX  VERSE  As when the Flames beneath a Caldron rise    It is impossible to render literally such Passages with any tolerable Beauty These Ideas can never be made to shine in  English  some Particularities cannot be preserv'd but the  Greek  Language gives them Lustre the Words are noble and musical  All therefore that can be expected from a Translator is to preserve the Meaning of the Simile and embellish it with some Words of Affinity that carry nothing low in the Sense or Sound  XXI  VERSE  And soft remurmur in their native bed    Here ends the  Episode  of the  RiverFight  and I must here lay before the Reader my Thoughts upon the whole of it Which appears to be in part an Allegory and in part a true History Nothing can give a better Idea of  Homer  's manner of enlivening his inanimate Machines and of making the plainest and simplest Incidents noble and poetical than to consider the whole Passage in the common historical Sense which I suppose to be no more than this There happen'd a great Overflow of the River  Xanthus  during the Seige which very much incommoded the Assailants This gave occasion for the Fiction of an Engagement between  Achilles  and the RiverGod  Xanthus  calling  Simois  to assist him implies that these two neighbouring Rivers join'd in the Inundation  Pallas  and  Neptune  relieve  Achilles  that is  Pallas  or the  Wisdom  of  Achilles  found some means to divert the Waters and turn them into the  Sea  wherefore  Neptune  the God of it is feign'd to assist him  Jupiter  and  Juno  by which are understood the aerial Regions consent to aid  Achilles  this may signify that after this great Flood their happen'd a warm dry windy Season which asswaged the Waters and dried the Ground And what makes this in a manner plain is that  Juno  which signifies the  Air  promises to send the  North  and  West Winds  to distress the River  Xanthus  being consum'd by  Vulcan  that is dried up with Heat prays to  Juno  to relieve him What is this but that the Drought having almost drunk up his Streams he has recourse to the  Air  for Rains to resupply his Current Or perhaps the whole may signify no more than that  Achilles  being on the farther side of the River plung'd himself in to pursue the Enemy that in this Adventure he run the risk of being drown'd that to save himself he laid hold on a fallen Tree which serv'd to keep him afloat that he was still carried down the Stream to the Place where was the Confluence of the two Rivers which is express'd by the one calling the other to his Aid and that when he came nearer the Sea  Neptune  he found means by his Prudence  Pallas  to save himself from his Danger  If the Reader still should think the Fiction of Rivers speaking and fighting is too bold the Objection will vanish by considering how much the Heathen Mythology authorizes the Representation of Rivers as Persons Nay even in old Historians nothing is more common than Stories of Rapes committed by RiverGods And the Fiction was no way unpresidented after one of the same nature so well known as the Engagement between  Hercules  and the River  Achelous  XXII  VERSE  Jove  as his Sport the dreadful Scene descries  And views contending Gods with careless Eyes    I was at a loss for the reason why  Jupiter  is said to smile at the Discord of the Gods till I found it in  Eustathius Jupiter  says he who is the Lord of Nature is well pleased with the War of the Gods that is of Earth Sea and Air  c  because the Harmony of all Beings arises from that Discord Thus Earth is opposite to Water Air to Earth and Water to them all and yet from this Opposition arises that discordant Concord by which all Nature subsists Thus Heat and Cold moist and dry are in a continual War yet upon this depends the Fertility of the Earth and the Beauty  of the Creation So that  Jupiter  who according to the  Greeks  is the Soul of all may well be said to smile at this Contention  XXIII  VERSE  The Power of Battels  c  The Combate of  Mars  and  Pallas  is plainly allegorical Justice and Wisdom demanded that an end should be put to this terrible War the God of War opposes this but is worsted  Eustathius  says that this holds forth the Opposition of Rage and Wisdom and no sooner has our Reason subdued one Temptation but another succeeds to reinforce it thus  Venus  succours  Mars  The Poet seems farther to insinuate that Reason when it resists a Temptation vigorously easily overcomes it So it is with the utmost Facility that  Pallas  conquers both  Mars  and  Venus  He adds that  Pallas  retreated from  Mars  in order to conquer him this shews us that the best way to subdue a Temptation is to retreat from it  XXIV  VERSE  Then heav'd the Goddess in her mighty Hand  A Stone  c  The Poet has describ'd many of his Heroes in former parts of his Poem as throwing Stones of enormous Bulk and Weight but here he rises in his Image He is describing a Goddess and has found a way to make that Action excel all human Strength and be equal to a Deity  Virgil  has imitated this Passage in his twelfth Book and apply'd it to  Turnus  but I can't help thinking that the action in a Mortal is somewhat extravagantly imagined What principally renders it so is an Addition of two Lines to this Simile which he borrows from another part of  Homer  only with this difference that whereas  Homer  says no two Men could raise such a Stone  Virgil  extends it to twelve  Saxum circumspicit ingens  Saxum antiquum ingens campo quod forte jacebat  Limes agro positus litem ut discerneret arvis  There is a Beauty in the Repetition of  Saxum ingens  in the second Line it makes us dwell upon the Image and gives us Leisure to consider the Vastness of the Stone The other two Lines are as follow  Vix illud lecti bis sex cervice subirent  Qualia nunc hominum producit corpora tellus  May I be allowed to think they are not so well introduced in  Virgil  For it is just after  Turnus  is describ'd as weaken'd and oppress'd with his Fears and ill Omens it exceeds Probability and  Turnus  methinks looks more like a KnightErrant in a Romance than an Hero in an Epick Poem  XXV  VERSE  The God of Ocean and the God of Light    The Interview between  Neptune  and  Apollo  is very judiciously in this place enlarged upon by our Author The Poem now draws to a Conclusion the  Trojans  are to be punish'd for their Perjury and Violence  Homer  accordingly with a poetical Justice sums up the Evidence against them and represents the very Founder of  Troy  as an injurious person There have been several References to this Story since the Beginning of the Poem but he forbore to give it at large till near the end of it that it might be fresh upon the Memory and shew the  Trojans  deserve the Punishment they are about to suffer  Eustathius  gives the reason why  Apollo  assists the  Trojans  tho' he had been equally with  Neptune  affronted by  Laomedon  This proceeded from the Honours which  Apollo  receiv'd from the Posterity of  Laomedon Troy  paid him no less Worship than  Cilla  or  Tenedos  and by these means won him over to a Forgiveness But  Neptune  still was slighted and consequently continued an Enemy to the whole Race  The same Author gives us various Opinions why  Neptune  is said to have built the  Trojan  Wall and to have been defrauded of his Wages Some say that  Laomedon  sacrilegiously took away the Treasures out of the Temples of  Apollo  and  Neptune  to carry on the Fortifications From whence it was fabled that  Neptune  and  Apollo  built the Walls Others will have it that two of the Workmen dedicated their Wages to  Apollo  and  Neptune  and that  Laomedon  detained them So that he might in some sense be said to defraud the Deities themselves by withholding what was dedicated to their Temples  The reason why  Apollo  is said to have kept the Herds of  Laomedon  is not so clear  Eustathius  observes that all Plagues first seize upon the fourfooted Creation and are suppos'd to arise from this Deity Thus  Apollo  in the first Book sends the Plague into the  Grecian  Army The Ancients therefore made him to preside over Cattel that by preserving them from the Plague Mankind might be safe from infectious Diseases Others tell us that this Employment is ascrib'd to  Apollo  because he signifies the Sun Now the Sun cloaths the Pastures with Grass and Herbs So that  Apollo  may be said himself to feed the Cattel by supplying them with Food Upon either of these accounts  Laomedon  may be said to be ungrateful to that Deity for raising no Temple to his Honour  It is observable that  Homer  in this Story ascribes the building of the Wall to  Neptune  only I should conjecture the reason might be that  Troy  being a Seaport Town the chief Strength of it depended upon its Situation so that the Sea was in a manner a Wall to it Upon this account  Neptune  may not improbably be said to have built the Wall  XXVI  VERSE  For what is Man  c  The Poet is very happy in interspersing his Poem with moral Sentences in this place he steals away his Reader from War and Horror and gives him a beautiful Admonition of his own Frailty  "Shall I says  Apollo  contend with thee for the sake of Man  Man who is no more than a Leaf of a Tree now green and flourishing but soon wither'd away and gone"  The Son of  Sirach  has an Expression which very much resembles this  Ecclus  xiv  As the green Leaves upon a thick Tree some fall and some grow so is the Generation of Flesh and Blood one cometh to an end and one is born  XXVII  VERSE  And from the Senior God submiss retires    Two things hinder  Homer  from making  Neptune  and  Apollo  fight First because having already describ'd the Fight between  Vulcan  and  Xanthus  he has nothing farther to say here for it is the same Conflict between Humidity and Dryness Secondly  Apollo  being the same with Destiny and the Ruin of the  Trojans  being concluded upon and decided that God can no longer defer it  Dacier  XXVIII  VERSE  The female Plague  Fierce to the feeble Race of Womankind  c  The Words in the Original are  Tho'  Jupiter  has made you a Lyon to Women  The meaning of this is that  Diana  was terrible to that Sex as being the same with the Moon and bringing on the Pangs of Childbirth Or else that the Ancients attributed all sudden Deaths of Women to the Darts of  Diana  as of Men to those of  Apollo  Which Opinion is frequently alluded to in  Homer Eustathius  XXIX  VERSE  Whom Hermes viewing thus declines the War    It is impossible that  Mercury  should encounter  Latona  Such a Fiction would be unnatural he being a Planet and she representing the Night for the Planets owe all their Lustre to  the Shades of the Night and then only become visible to the World  Eustathius  XXX  VERSE  She said and seiz'd her Wrists  c  I must confess I am at a loss how to justify  Homer  in every point of these Combats of the Gods When  Diana  and  Juno  are to fight  Juno  calls her an  impudent Bitch  When they fight she boxes her soundly and sends her crying and trembling to Heaven As soon as she comes thither  Jupiter  falls a laughing at her Indeed the rest of the Deities seem to be in a merry Vein during all the Action  Pallas  beats  Mars  and laughs at him  Jupiter  sees them in the same merry mood  Juno  when she had cuff'd  Diana  is not more serious In short unless there be some Depths that I am not able to fathom  Homer  never better deserv'd than in this place the Censure past upon him by the Ancients that as he rais'd the Characters of his Men up to Gods so he sunk those of Gods down to Men  Yet I think it but reasonable to conclude from the very Absurdity of all this supposing it had no hidden Meaning or Allegory that there must therefore certainly be some Nor do I think it any Inference to the contrary that it is too obscure for us to find out The Remoteness of our Times must necessarily darken yet more and more such Things as were Mysteries at first Not that it is at all impossible notwithstanding their present Darkness but they might then have been very obvious as it is certain Allegories ought to be disguis'd but not obscur'd An Allegory should be like a Veil over a beautiful Face so fine and transparent as to shew the very Charms it covers  XXXI  VERSE  As when avenging Flames with Fury driv'n  On guilty Towns exert the Wrath of Heaven    This Passage may be explain'd two ways each very remarkable First by taking this Fire for a real Fire sent from Heaven to punish a criminal City of which we have Example  in holy Writ Hence we find that  Homer  had a Notion of this great Truth that God sometimes exerts his Judgments on whole Cities in this signal and terrible manner Or if we take it in the other sense simply as a Fire thrown into a Town by the Enemies who assault it and only express'd thus by the Author in the same manner as  Jeremy  makes the City of  Jerusalem  say when the  Chaldaeans  burnt the Temple  The Lord from above hath sent Fire into my Bones Lament  i Yet still thus much will appear understood by  Homer  that the Fire which is cast into a City comes not properly speaking from Men but from God who delivers it up to their Fury  Dacier  XXXII  VERSE  High on a Turret hoary  Priam c  The Poet still raises the Idea of the Courage and Strength of his Hero by making  Priam  in a Terror that he should enter the Town with the routed Troops For if he had not surpass'd all Mortals what could have been more desireable for an Enemy than to have let him in and then destroy'd him  Here again there was need of another  Machine  to hinder him from entring the City for  Achilles  being vastly speedier than those he pursued he must necessarily overtake some of them and the narrow Gates could not let in a body of Troops without his mingling with the hindmost The Story of  Agenor  is therefore admirably contriv'd and  Apollo  who was to take care that the fatal Decrees should be punctually executed interposes both to save  Agenor  and  Troy  for  Achilles  might have kill'd  Agenor  and still enter'd with the Troops if  Apollo  had not diverted him by the Pursuit of that Phantom  Agenor  oppos'd himself to  Achilles  only because he could not do better for he sees himself reduc'd to a Dilemma either ingloriously to perish among the Fugitives or hide himself in the Forest both which were equally unsafe Therefore he is purposely inspir'd with a generous Resolution to try to save his Countreymen and as the Reward of that Service is at last sav'd himself  XXXIII  VERSE  What shall I fly  c  This is a very beautiful Soliloquy of  Agenor  such a one as would naturally arise in the Soul of a brave Man going upon a desperate Enterprise He weighs every thing in the balance of Reason he sets before himself the Baseness of Flight and the Courage of his Enemy till at last the thirst of Glory preponderates all other Considerations From the Conclusion of this Speech it is evident that the Story of  Achilles  his being invulnerable except in the Heel is an Invention of latter Ages for had he been so there had been nothing wonderful in his Character  Eustathius  XXXIV  VERSE  Meanwhile the God to cover their Escape  c  The Poet makes a double use of this Fiction of  Apollo  's deceiving  Achilles  in the Shape of  Agenor  by these means he draws him from the Pursuit and gives the  Trojans  time to enter the City and at the same time brings  Agenor  handsomely off from the Combat The Moral of this Fable is that Destiny would not yet suffer  Troy  to fall  Eustathius  fancies that the occasion of the Fiction might be this  Agenor  fled from  Achilles  to the Banks of  Xanthus  and might there conceal himself from the Pursuer behind some Covert that grew on the Shores this perhaps might be the whole of the Story So plain a Narration would have pass'd in the Mouth of an Historian but the Poet dresses it in Fiction and tells us that  Apollo  or Destiny conceal'd him in a Cloud from the sight of his Enemy  The same Author farther observes that  Achilles  by an unseasonable peice of Vainglory in pursuing a single Enemy gives time to a whole Army to escape he neither kills  Agenor  nor overtakes the  Trojans  FINIS
