DCC LXVIII  TO THE DUCHESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND c  MADAM  PERMIT me to assure YOUR GRACE of the deep sense I retain of Your great Goodness and Condescension in the Protection which You have been pleased to extend to my first Effort in the Drama  Were I to listen to those suggestions that naturally arise in the mind of a Writer on the first dawnings of success the favourable reception which this Tragedy has met with from the Public would lead me to hope that it might not be found wholly unworthy of YOUR GRACE'S Patronage but when I reflect how many circumstances contribute to please on the Stage where every Thought  or Expression is enforced with the graces of action and utterance I cannot but be anxious lest the Reader should withhold that approbation in the closet which the Spectator testified in the representation  It is with the utmost Deference I submit the following Scenes to YOUR GRACE'S Perusal and am  MADAM  with the greatest respect YOUR GRACE'S most obliged most obedient and most devoted servant JOHN HOOLE  Clement's Inn  Dec  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr SMITH  NEW to the stage before this dread array  Prepar'd to offer here his virgin play  Our tim'rous Author diffident of praise  Grafts his first laurels on another's bays  Takes from another's breast the gen'rous fire  And fits to English strains a foreign lyre  Aspires to please by unsuspected means  Importing passion from Italian scenes  Where heroes combate to soft music's note  And tyrants warble thro' an eunuch's throat  To symphony despairing lovers sigh  And struggling traitors by the gamut die  Yet here a living bard whose fame outruns  The foremost of the tunesul Drama's sons  Can ev'n in song his magic pow'r dispense  At once uniting harmony and sense  From him our poet now essays to write  And plans from him the story of tonight  A wellknown talewho has not heard the name  Of CYRUS and the rising Median fame  Each puling schoolboy can discuss the theme  The suff'ring grandson and the monarch's dream  O should his genius catch th' inspiring thought  And nobly copy what was nobly wrought  Or where the master's hand but sketch'd the line  With happy warmth fill up the bold design  Then ev'ry figure with full force imprest  May wake the feelings of th' impassion'd breast  While each bright eye amidst this circle pays  The tribute of involuntary praise  Dramatis Personae

the Borders of Media  CYRUS A TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE  A wood a stately pavilion erected for  ASTYAGES  view of a temple at a distance  MANDANE ASPASIA  MANDANE  BEHOLD the limits of the Median land  And see the temple where Astyages  Returns each year to shed the victim's blood  On great Astarte's altarO Aspasia  This is the place the day nam'd by my father  To bless me with the tenderest interview  Here shall I meet again my long lost Cyrus  Is he not found was he not snatch'd from death  Sav'd by some God to fill these eager arms  And is not this the happy destin'd grove  Where once again I shall embrace my child  ASPASIA  'Tis truebut what can all this passion mean  MANDANE  What can it meanwhere is my Cyrus hid  What does hewherefore comes he not  ASPASIA  Alas  Time wing'd with swiftest pinions lags behind  The ardent wishes of a mother's love  Thou know'st the hour of sacrifice is fix'd  For his reception that we must not pay  Our vows to night's pale queen till yonder sun  Declines to ev'ning skies and now his beams  But just begin to dawn o'er eastern hills  MANDANE  Alas Aspasiastill I fear  ASPASIA  And wherefore  When now Astyages no longer seeks  His death but wishes to behold his Cyrus  To give him back a parent's kind protection  And shew in him our Media's future king  MANDANE  Yet if the visions of the night may claim  Beliefa dreadful dream  ASPASIA  And shall Mandane  Be mov'd with shadows sure you should detest  Such visionary fears from these you first  May date your sorrows well you know your father  On the vain credit of a dream condemn'd  Your Cyrus to be slain nor this suffic'd  But that the nuptial bed no more might prove  Fruitful to thee in children and to him  Give endless cause of terror far from hence  To banishment he sent your lord your husband  Your dear Cambyses where in Persia's realm  He lives an alien to his consort's arms  MANDANE  And yet 'tis not a dream that twice ten years  Have seen the chearful harvest crown our fields  Since at his birth my child was ravish'd from me  On this blest day I hope once more to see him  And thinks Aspasia now to find me calm  ASPASIA  You lost your Cyrus when your age had scarce  Beheld the round of thirteen annual suns  And can you still so deeply feel the grief  Imprest in life's first bloom  MANDANE  Alas Aspasia  Thou know'st not what it is to be a mother  ASPASIA  Yet your Aspasia too has known her sorrows  If you lament a husband and a son  I mourn a brother's loss who fell beneath  The vengeful anger of Astyages  MANDANE  There there my bosom shar'd thy father's sufferings  And oft I've wept in secret his misfortunes  Unhappy man a fatal recompense  My father gavethee for his grandson sav'd  What hast thou suffer'd for thy love to Cyrus  Thy loyal truthbut see the good man comes  He comes perchance with tidings of my son  O haste my Harpagus where is he  Enter  HARPAGUS  HARPAGUS  Princess  Your son is now arriv'd  MANDANE  Arriv'dahwhere  HARPAGUS  He must not till Astyages appears  Presume to pass the borders of the kingdom  'Tis so decreed  MANDANE  Then let us seek him out  Where now impatient with long exil'd feet  He comes to tread his native wish'dfor soil  And ease a mother's pains  Going  HARPAGUS  It must not be  Mandane stayyour father will be present  A witness to your meeting  MANDANE  Wherefore then  This long delayO did Astyages  Feel half Mandane feels these arms had now  Embrac'd my dearest Cyrus what detains  My father thus  HARPAGUS  'Ere now he's on his way  But the long pomp that waits on Media's kings  Forbids his swift approach  MANDANE  And must Mandane  Attend the dull and tedious forms of state  Aspasia if thou lov'st me instant go  And seek the blooming youthYet stay and hear me  Observe his air his voice his ev'ry look  Mark if his features bear his mother's likeness  Or his lov'd father'sBut als I rave  Thou never knew'st his hapless banish'd father  Relate my sufferings and enquire of his  Ask what kind hand supply'd a mother's care  How when Mandane torn with heartfelt anguish  Deem'd him a prey to savage rage the woods  Preserv'd him in their hospitable shades  Tell himO heaven I know not whatbut tell him  More than a mother's fondness can express  Not what I speak but all I wish to utter  O fly and with the rapid speed of thought  Return to my impatience    Exit  ASPASIA  HARPAGUS  Should this day  That gives once more your son to your embrace  Restore Cambyses to you  MANDANE  Would to heaven  I might indulge that hopeAll gracious powers  What torture in his exile must he feel  To hear his son yet lives to know this day  Restores my Cyrus to his native land  Yet be deny'd to gaze with transport on him  Or clasp him in a father's sheltering arms  HARPAGUS  Hear and be silenthappier fortune now  Prepares to crown each wish your soul can form  Cambyses is at hand  MANDANE  Cambyses where  O tell me Harpagus  HARPAGUS  I dare not further  Explain it nowlet this suffice  MANDANE  Alas  I fear thou dost deceive me  HARPAGUS  No Mandane  Trust to my faithThis day you shall behold him  MANDANE  Ye powers what deluge of unhop'dfor bliss  Now bursts upon me O my son my husband  Happy MandaneHarpagus my friend  Teach me to bear this wild excess of joy  HARPAGUS  Be calm compose your looks let not the king  Perceive this conflict of tumultuous passions  MANDANE  Yes I will go and meet Astyages  Will strive to hide the strugglings of my soul  Check these emotions though my swelling bosom  Can scarce find room to hold the mighty transport  Transport which only such as I can feel  And only those who love like me conceive  Exit  HARPAGUS  alone  Thus far 'tis wellThis day I mean to shew  The hidden Cyrus to the expecting world  The realm is ripe for a revolt the nobles  Resolve to invest him with the regal sway  But my resentment still demands its victim  Yes dearest shade of my lamented son  For ever present to thy father's sight  Thou yet shalt be appeas'd for this so long  I've worn the mask of loyaltybut now  Vengeance is on the wing she tow'rs alost  And like an eagle kens her destin'd prey  Exit  SCENE  changes to a grove outside of a sinall building of simple architecture representing the dwelling of  MITHRANES  Enter  CYRUS  and  MITHRANES  CYRUS  Can it be possible O say my father  For such thou still hast been am I indeed  The Median Cyrus Sure I dream am I  The offspring of Cambyses and Mandane  That wretched offspring whom Astyages  Sentenc'd to die when scarce the vital spirit  Breath'd from his infant lips  MITHRANES  Believe me prince  Thou art that offspring  CYRUS  Tell me then Mithranes  How many bear the name Thou know'st already  One Cyrus on the borders of the land  Is now arriv'd and comes not here the king  To welcome his approach  MITHRANES  The king's deceiv'd  That Cyrus is but feign'dthou art the true  CYRUS  Whence is this mystery  MITHRANES  Astyages  When thou wert yet unborn beheld a vision  That fill'd his soul with dread  CYRUS  Of this Mithranes  Thou need'st not speak oft have I heard it told  How from his dream the magic had denounc'd  That of Mandane should a child be born  That must one day deprive him of his throne  And well I know at Cyrus' luckless birth  The rigid charge was given to Harpagus  To end his life and ease a monarch's fears  MITHRANES  From thence begins a tale thou ne'er hast heard  The cruel sentence Harpagus receiv'd  His heart refus'd to obey to me he brought thee  Wrapp'd in a regal mantle  CYRUS  Then 'twas thou  That in the woods expos'd  MITHRANES  Not sobe patient  My consort then mark well the providence  That watch'd thy preservation had brought forth  A lifeless child thy harmless innocence  Excited pity on thy tender cheek  Stood the big tear as if thy heart already  Were conscious of misfortune while thy hands  Were stretch'd as if to implore protection from us  My Barce wept and with a mother's fondness  Clasp'd in her arms she strain'd thee to her bosom  Lull'd thee to rest and hush'd thy little sorrows  CRYUS  Forgive me sir if gratitude awhile  Breaks in upon your tale and fills my eyes  In dear remembrance of your Barce's virtues  She whose indulgence watch'd my helpless years  MITHRANES  T  ou wert indeed the darling of her age  As my own son I bred thee in these shades  And call'd thy name Alcaeus in thy stead  Exposing in the wood the lifeless infant  CYRUS  What of Astyages  MITHRANES  When he believ'd  His dire command compleated nature's voice  At length awaken'd in his breast remorse  Full fifteen years did Harpagus remain  Without disclosing aught then seem'd the tale  Ripe for discovery yet he first would prove  The current's depth before he left the shore  Five years have now elaps'd since thro' the realm  The tidings spread that Cyrus being found  An infant in the forest was preserv'd  And liv'd among the Scythians such report  Perhaps the impostor rais'd or from the rumour  Perhaps he sprung but be it as it may  Some bold adventurer lur'd with hopes of greatness  Usurps thy name  CYRUS  Is this the Cyrus then  Who comes  MITHRANES  The samebut mark meHarpagus  Procur'd the fiction credit with the king  For thus he reason'dshould Astyages  With joy receive the news I safely may  Reveal the kingdom's heir or should his fears  Once more return and prompt some new design  Against the prince the baffled aim will light  Upon the impostor's head  CYRUS  But since the king  Confesses now such tenderness for Cyrus  At length recalls him from a life of exile  To clasp him to his bosom wakens all  The soft endearments in a mother's soul  And every tender passion in a son  Wherefore should unavailing caution still  Withhold the secret from him  MITHRANES  Harpagus  Relies not firmly on the royal goodness  For when he own'd that with compassion mov'd  He had not slain the infant but expos'd him  Amidst the woods Astyages to punish  His disobedience doom'd to cruel death  His only son and though the king now seems  To mourn his grandson's fate and wears the semblance  Of deep remorse yet sure but ill agrees  Such love for thee with such resentment shewn  Against thy kind preserver  CYRUS  Tell me ther  Why at this solemn pomp of sacrifice  Are all our country's nobles here conven'd  But to receive the lawful successor  And shall not Cyrus conscious of his birth  Strip from a bold impostor his salse titles  And stand reveal'd to all Oh sir by you  Ev'n 'midst these rude uncultivated wilds  My soul has long been train'd to virtuous daring  And shall I now ignobly lurk conceal'd  What can the subject hope from such a prince  That king will never guard his people's rights  Who wants the courage to assert his own  MITHRANES  O greatly urg'dyet think not my lov'd prince  Mithranes less regards thy fame than safety  Suppress a few short hours this generous ardour  Soon as you sun shall reach the western waves  Thou shalt be shewn to all thou shalt embrace  Thy parents yet unknown th' assembled nobles  Shall own thy cause and ev'n Astyages  Receive in thee the kingdom's better hope  CYRUS  What say'st thou shall I then with filial transport  Embrace his honour'd knees whom fate deny'd  To guard my youth with his paternal care  Hang on a mother's circling arms that never  Till this blest moment clasp'd a banish'd son  And never rear'd his infant years with fondness  MITHRANES  Thou shalt my prince Cambyses will ere long  Arrive already is Mandane here  CYRUS  Mandanelet me fly to ease her breast  Of every racking doubt and dry the tears  Of an afflicted parent  Going  MITHRANES  Hear me still  Cambyses and Mandane both suppose  The impostor is their son and much it now  Imports they should be still deceiv'd till time  Matures our enterprize for should Mandane  Learn that in thee he lives  CYRUS  Fear not Mithranes  This day the mighty secret shall remain  Lock'd in my breast I never will reveal it  Till thou permit'st melet me but behold her  FarewellDost thou still doubt my faithI call  On every God to witness to my vows  Going  MITHRANES  Ohno forbearwhen wilt thou learn to curb  These eager sallies of unbridled passion  This is the awful day that teems with thine  And Media's fate Thou know'st that ev'ry deed  Must first begin with Heav'nGo seek the temple  Devoutly there implore the gracious Gods  To smile propitious on our hopes and learn  Henceforth to moderateWhat have I said  Cyrus forgive this licence of my tongue  So long accustom'd to a father's language  I now must change my speechI am no more  The rigid parent that reproves his son  I am a subject that with faithful counsels  Wou'd aid his sov'reign  CYRUS  Thou art still my father  My dearest fatherI confess my warm  Ungovern'd temper but I will suppress  These starts of youth and learn to tread the path  Thy wisdom points too dearly should I buy  The throne if I no more must call thee father  MITHRANES  Yes royal youth thou shalt be still my son  Son of my fondest hopesfor thee I've watch'd  The tedious round of twenty circling years  Each turn of fate in this sequester'd dwelling  Far distant from the busy haunts of men  Where but on this returning annual pomp  Of sacrifice the print of human feet  Scarce marks the unworn turf  CYRUS  Once more farewell  Yes I will seek yon hallow'd roof to raise  Devotion's voice and supplicate the Gods  To breathe a hero's spirit in this breast  That when the ripening hours shall bring to light  The wish'd events of this auspicious day  My soul enlarg'd to thoughts of conscious greatness  May hail with virtuous pride its birth to glory  Exit  MITHRANES  All gracious heav'n with thy protecting arm  Defend my prince Let me in one glad moment  Reap the full harvest of my pious toils  And old Mithranes then has liv'd enough  But see where Harpagus appears  Enter  HARPAGUS  My friend  Where is Astyages  HARPAGUS  But now arriv'd  I left him in his tent in gloomy silence  As if revolving in his mind the end  Of this day's sacrifice He sends me hither  To learn if Cyrus yet approach the borders  And what the train he brings  MITHRANES  Believ'st thou then  He means indeed to answer Media's hopes  And give the realm a successor in Cyrus  HARPAGUS  Trust me Mithranes neverIf sometimes  He feigns a momentary joy or speaks  With seeming fondness of the approach of Cyrus  Methinks thro' all the dark disguise appears  Some cruel purpose brooding in his soul  MITHRANES  Thanks to the pow'r that thus provides a victim  To frustrate ev'ry ill that thence might threaten  The safety of the prince this bold impostor  Who wears his name shall with his name inherit  Each evil that's design'd him  HARPAGUS  Nor does Media  Owe less her thanks to heav'n that gave Mithranes  To rear her prince to every future greatness  In virtue's safest school an humble station  Far from the splendid vices of a court  Where golden luxury and silken sloth  Enervate our unhappy sonsBut say  Hast thou to Cyrus yet reveal'd his birth  MITHRANES  I have  HARPAGUS  And how did he receive the tidings  MITHRANES  Amaz'd at first he heard the important truth  But when convinc'dO had you then beheld  His generous ardourscarce cou'd I prevent  His filial love from seeking out Mandane  And throwing at her feet a darling son  HARPAGUS  Of that we must bewareThe weighty secret  Of his concealment must not be entrusted  To a fond mother's transports not Cambyses  Knows yet this mystery of fate  MITHRANES  'Tis strange  Cambyses comes not yet  HARPAGUS  Doubt not Mithranes  Cambyses will be present 'ere the hour  Fix'd for the sacrifice perhaps ev'n now  He lurks disguis'd upon the neighbouring confines  He must be wary well thou know'st what danger  Awaits him shou'd Astyages discover  His mandate disobey'dbut let us part  We must not thus be found the king may soon  Be here where'er he goes pale visag'd fear  And black suspicion on his steps attend  Exeunt severally  END  of the  FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  continues  Enter  MITHRANES  CYRUS not yet return'd still still my breast  Owns all the fears and fondness of a father  But

To princely Harpagus  MITHRANES  The king now holds him  On business of the state this day the people  Expect to find the kingdom's heir restor'd  If haply thou hast heard the name of Cyrus  CAMBYSES  Fame has thro' many a land divulg'd your story  I knew Cambyses both in Persia born  One city bred us I remember well  A private warrior when he sought the court  Of Media's king till by his merit rais'd  He gain'd Mandane's hand but dearly since  He paid the price of love with years of exile  MITHRANES  Shall I yet speak  Aside  Since thou indeed hast known  To Cambyses  Unfortunate

wiles  Perhaps confederate with thy father's foes  MANDANE  What do I hear And can you thoughts suggest  My soul is chill'd with horror that Mandane  Would join in murder's black conspiracy  Against the hand that gave me life  ASTYAGES  I know not  Whom should I fear Methinks I see rebellion  Where duty's most profess'd and those my power  Can shake with terror give me equal dread  But for

pangsbut as I prize  My crown again he's banish'd from the land  Exit  MANDANE  And is it thus my fate begins to smile  Is this the meeting Harpagus foretold  O my Cambyses  Enter  CYRUS  What art thou that break'st  Thus importunely on my grief  CYRUS  Forgive  This seeming rudeness beauteous excellence  A son of freedom nurtur'd in these woods  Now shuns a fate that threats that liberty  Which bounteous nature gave  MANDANE  What dost thou mean  CYRUS  The royal guards pursue my steps and soon  These limbs that 'till this hour have rang'd at large  O'er the steep hill or through the forest shade  May seel the galling weight of servile chains  MANDANE  Declare thy crime  CYRUS  My crime was selfdefence  Th' oppressor's sword was rais'd against my life  But heav'n then nerv'd my strength and from this arm  The wretch receiv'd that death he meant to give  MANDANE  What means my throbbing bosomGentle youth  Proceedmethinks I feel some secret impulse  To listen to thy story  CYRUS  As but now  Alone I sought the temple from the woods  I heard a cry of deep distressI turn'd  And saw two ruffians seize a beauteous maid  Fir'd at the brutal deed I cast my dart  And one I slew the other struck with terror  Forsook th' affrighted fair who trembling fled  And ere I could pursue her stops a youth  Of fierce demeanour clad in rich attire  With sword unsheath'd impetuous cross'd my way  And menac'd vengeance for his slain companion  But see the nymph herself whom fav'ring heav'n  Sent me to save  Enter  ASPASIA  MANDANE  Wert thou the maid distress'd  And is it true that thou hast 'scap'd the arm  Of brutal violence  ASPASIA  Yes sell destruction  Was hov'ring o'er me when behold the friend  That freed Aspasia from impending ruin  With peril of his ownbut thanks to heav'n  My brave defender livesSay gallant youth  How did'st thou 'scape the ruffian's boist'rous rage  That threaten'd thee with death  MANDANE  Relate the sequel  For since Aspasia bears an
