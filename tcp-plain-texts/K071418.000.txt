Collins and E Newbery  M DCC XCII  AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE AND GENIUS OF SAMUEL JOHNSON LLD  WHEN the works of a great Writer who has bequeathed to posterity a lasting legacy are presented to the world it is naturally expected that some account of his life should accompany the edition The Reader wishes to know as much as possible of the Author The circumstances that attended him the features of his private character his conversation and the means by which he rose to eminence become the favourite  objects of enquiry Curiosity is excited and the admirer of his works is eager to know his private opinions his course of study the particularities of his conduct and above all whether he pursued the wisdom which he recommends and practised the virtue which his writings inspire A principle of gratitude is awakened in every generous mind For the entertainment and instruction which genius and diligence have provided for the world men of refined and sensible tempers are ready to pay their tribute of praise and even to form a posthumous friendship with the author  In reviewing the life of such a writer there is besides a rule of justice to which the publick have an undoubted claim Fond admiration and partial friendship should not be suffered to represent his virtues with exaggeration nor should malignity be allowed under a specious disguise to magnify mere defects the usual failings of human nature into vice or gross deformity The lights and shades of the character should be given and if this be done with a strict regard to truth a just estimate of Dr Johnson will afford a lesson perhaps  as valuable as the moral doctrine that speaks with energy in every page of his works  The present writer enjoyed the conversation and friendship of that excellent man more than thirty years He thought it an honour to be so connected and to this hour he reflects on his loss with regret but regret he knows has secret bribes by which the judgement may be influenced and partial affection may be carried beyond the bounds of truth In the present case however nothing needs to be disguised and exaggerated praise is unnecessary It is an observation of the younger Pliny in his Epistle to his Friend of Tacitus that history ought never to magnify matters of fact because worthy actions require nothing but the truth  Nam nec historia debet egredi veritatem et honeste factis veritas sufficit  This rule the present biographer promises shall guide his pen throughout the following narrative  It may be said the death of Dr Johnson kept the public mind in agitation beyond all former example No literary character ever  excited so much attention and when the press has teemed with anecdotes apophthegms essays and publications of every kind what occasion now for a new tract on the same threadbare subject The plain truth shall be the answer The proprietors of Johnson's Works thought the life which they prefixed to their former edition too unwieldy for republication The prodigious variety of foreign matter introduced into that performance seemed to overload the memory of Dr Johnson and in the account of his own life to leave him hardly visible They wished to have a more concise and for that reason perhaps a more satisfactory account such as may exhibit a just picture of the man and keep him the principal figure in the fore ground of his own picture To comply with that request is the design of this essay which the writer undertakes with a trembling hand He has no discoveries no secret anecdotes no occasional controversy no sudden flashes of wit and humour no private conversation and no new facts to embellish his work Every thing has been gleaned Dr Johnson said of himself  I am not uncandid nor severe I sometimes  say more than I mean in jest and people are apt to think me serious  Boswell's Life of Johnson Vol II p    The exercise of that privilege which is enjoyed by every man in society has not been allowed to him His fame has given importance even to trifles and the zeal of his friends has brought every thing to light What should be related and what should not has been published without distinction  Dicenda tacenda locuti  Every thing that fell from him has been caught with eagerness by his admirers who as he says in one of his letters have acted with the diligence of spies upon his conduct To some of them the following lines in Mallet's Poem on Verbal Criticism are not inapplicable  "Such that grave bird in Northern seas is found  "Whose name a Dutchman only knows to sound  "Wheree'er the king of fish moves on before  "This humble friend attends from shore to shore  "With eye still earnest and with bill inclin'd  "He picks up what his patron drops behind  "With those choice cates his palate to regale  "And is the careful TIBBALD of A WHALE"  After so many essays and volumes of  Johnsoniana  what remains for the present writer Perhaps what has not been attempted a short yet full a faithful yet temperate history of Dr Johnson  SAMUEL JOHNSON was born at Lichfield September O S  This appears in a note to Johnson's Diary prefixed to the first of his prayers After the alteration of the stile he kept his birthday on the th of September and it is accordingly marked September    His father Michael Johnson was a bookseller in that city a man of large athletic make and violent passions wrongheaded positive and at times afflicted with a degree of melancholy little short of madness His mother was sister to Dr Ford a practising physician and father or Cornellus Ford generally known by the name of PARSON FORD the same who is represented near the punchbowl in Hogarth's Midnight Modern Conversation In the Life of Fanton Johnson says that  his abilities instead or furnishing convivial merriment to the voluptuous and dissolute might have enabled him to excel among the virtuous and the  wife  Being chaplain to the Earl of Chesterfield he wished to attend that nobleman on his embassy to the Hague Colley Cibber has recorded the anecdote "You should go" said the witty peer  if to your many vices you would add one more  Pray my Lord what is that  Hypocrisy my dear Doctor  Johnson had a younger brother named Nathaniel who died at the age of twentyseven or twentyeight Michael Johnson the father was chosen in the year Under Bailiff of Lichfield and in the year he served the office of the Senior Bailiff He had a brother of the name of Andrew who for some years kept the ring at Smithfield appropriated to wrestlers and boxers Our author used to say that he was never thrown or conquered Michael the father died December at the age of seventysix his mother at eightynine of a gradual decay in the year Of the family nothing more can be related worthy of notice Johnson did not delight in talking of his relations  There is little pleasure  he said to Mrs Piozzi  in relating the anecdotes of beggary  Johnson derived from his parents or from an unwholesome nurse the distemper called the King's Evil The Jacobites at that time believed in the efficacy of the royal touch and accordingly Mrs Johnson presented her son when two years old before Queen Anne who for the first time performed that office and communicated to her young patient all the healing virtue in her power He was afterwards cut for that scrophulous humour and the under part of his face was seamed and disfigured by the operation It is supposed that this disease deprived him of the sight of his left eye and also impaired his hearing At eight years old he was placed under Mr Hawkins at the Freeschool at Lichfield where he was not remarkable for diligence or regular application Whatever he read his tenacious memory made his own In the fields with his schoolfellows he talked more to himself than with his companions In when he was about sixteen years old he went on a visit to his cousin Cornelius Ford who detained him for some months and in the mean time assisted him in the classics The  general direction for his studies which he then received he related to Mrs Piozzi "Obtain" says Ford  some general principles of every science he who can talk only on one subject or act only in one department is seldom wanted and perhaps never wished for while the man of general knowledge can often benefit and always please  This advice Johnson seems to have pursued with a good inclination His reading was always desultory seldom resting on any particular author but rambling from one book to another and by hasty snatches hoarding up a variety of knowledge It may be proper in this place to mention another general rule laid down by Ford for Johnson's future conduct  You will make your way the more easily in the world as you are contented to dispute no man's claim to conversationexcellence they will therefore more willingly allow your pretensions as a writer  "But" says Mrs Piozzi  the features of peculiarity which mark a character to all succeeding generations are slow in coming to their growth  That ingenious lady adds with her usual vivacity  Can one on such an occasion forbear recollecting  the predictions of Boileau's father who said stroking the head of the young satirist 'this little man has too much wit but he will never speak ill of any one'  On Johnson's return from Cornelius Ford Mr Hunter then Master of the Freeschool at Lichfield refused to receive him again on that foundation At this distance of time what his reasons were it is vain to enquire but to refuse assistance to a lad of promising genius must be pronounced harsh and illiberal It did not however stop the progress of the young student's education He was placed at another school at Stourbridge in Worcestershire under the care of Mr Wentworth Having gone through the rudiments of classic literature‚ñ™ he returned to his father's house and was probably intended for the trade of a bookseller He has been heard to say that he could  ind a book At the end of two years being than about nineteen he went to assist the studies of a young gentleman of the name of Corbet to the University of Oxford and on the st of October both were entered of Pembroke College Corbet as a gentlemancommoner  and Johnson as a commoner The college tutor Mr Jordan was a man of no genius and Johnson it seems shewed an early contempt of mean abilities in one or two instances behaving with insolence to that gentleman Of his general conduct at the university there are no particulars that merit attention except the translation of Pope's Messiah which was a college exercise imposed upon him as a talk by Mr Jordan Corbet left the university in about two years and Johnson's salary ceased He was by consequence straitened in his circumstances but he still remained at college Mr Jordan the tutor went off to a living and was succeeded by Dr Adams who afterwards became head of the college and was esteemed through life for his learning his talents and his amiable character Johnson grew more regular in his attendance Ethics theology and classic literature were his favourite studies He discovered notwithstanding early symptoms of that wandering dispostion of mind which adhered to him to the end of his life His reading was by sits and starts undirected to any particular science General philology agreeably  to his cousin Ford's advice was the object of his ambition He received at that time an early impression of piety and a taste for the best authors ancient and modern It may notwithstanding be questioned whether except his Bible he ever read a book entirely through Late in life if any man praised a book in his presence he was sure to ask "Did you read it through" If the answer was in the affirmative he did not seem willing to believe it He continued at the university till the want of pecuniary supplies obliged him to quit the place He obtained however the assistance of a friend and returning in a short time was able to complete a residence of three years The history of his exploits at Oxford he used to say was best known to Dr Taylor and Dr Adams Wonders are told of his memory and indeed all who knew him late in life can witness that he retained that faculty in the greatest vigour  From the university Johnson returned to Lichfield His father died soon after December and the whole receipt out of his effects as appeared by a memorandum in the  son's handwriting dated th June was no more than twenty pounds  The entry of this is remarkable for his early resolution to preserve through life a fair and upright character  Junii Undecim aureos deposui quo die quidquid ante matris sunus quod serum sit precor de paternis bonis sperare licet viginti scilicet libras accepi Usque adeo mihi mea fortuna singenda est interea et ne paupertate vires animi languescant ne in flagitia egestas adigat cavendum  In this exigence determined that poverty should neither depress his spirit nor warp his integrity he became undermaster of a Grammarschool at Market Bosworth in Leicestershire That resource however did not last long Disgusted by the pride of Sir Wolstan Dixie the patron of that little seminary he left the place in discontent and ever after spoke of it with abhorrence In he went on a visit to Mr Hector who had been his schoolfellow and was then a surgeon at Birmingham lodging at the house of Warren a bookseller At that place Johnson translated a Voyage to Abyssinia written by Jerome Lobo a Portugueze missionary This was the first literary work from the pen of Dr Johnson His friend Hector was occasionally his  amanuensis The work was probably undertaken at the desire of Warren the bookseller and was printed at Birmingham but it appears in the Literary Magazine or History of the Works of the Learned for March that it was published by Bettesworth and Hitch Paternosterrow It contains a narrative of the endeavours of a company of missionaries to convert the people of Abyssinia to the Church of Rome In the preface to this work Johnson observes  that the Portoguese traveller contrary to the general view of his countrymen has amused his readers with no romantic absurdities or incredible fictions He appears by his modest and unaffected narration to have described things as he saw them to have copied nature from the life and to have consulted his senses not his imagination He meets with no basilisles that destroy with their eyes his crocodiles devour their prey without tears and his cataracts fall from the rock without deafening the neighbouring inhabitants The reader will here find no regions cursed with irremediable barrenness or blessed with spontaneous fecundity no perpetual gloom or  unceasing sunshine nor are the nations here described either void of all sense of humanity or consummate in all private and social virtues here are no Hottentots without religion polity or articulate language no Chinese perfectly polite and completely skilled in all sciences he will discover what will always be discovered by a diligent and impartial enquirer that wherever human nature is to be found there is a mixture of vice and virtue a contest of passion and reason and that the Creator doth not appear partial in his distributions but has balanced in most countries their particular inconveniences by particular favours  We have here an early specimen of Johnson's manner the vein of thinking and the frame of the sentences are manifestly his we see the infant Hercules The translation of Lobo's Narrative has been reprinted lately in a separate volume with some other tracts of Dr Johnson's and therefore forms no part of this edition but a compendious account of so interesting a work as Father Lobo's discovery of the head of the Nile will not it is imagined be unacceptable to the reader  Father Lobo the Portuguese Missionary embarked in in the same fleet with the Count  Vidigueira  who was appointed by the king of Portugal Viceroy of the Indies They arrived at Goa and in January Father Lobo set out on the mission to Abyssinia Two of the Jesuits sent on the same commission were murdered in their attempt to penetrate into that empire Lobo had better success he surmounted all difficulties and made his way into the heart of the country Then follows a description of Abyssinia formerly the largest empire of which we have an account in history It extended from the Red Sea to the kingdom of Congo and from Aegypt to the Indian Sea containing no less than forty provinces At the time of Lobo's mission it was not much larger than Spain consisting then but of five kingdoms of which part was entirely subject to the Emperor and part paid him a tribute as an acknowledgement The provinces were inhabited by Moors Pagans Jews and Christians The last was in Lobo's time the established and reigning religion The diversity of people and religion is the reason  why the kingdom was under different forms of government with laws and customs extremely various Some of the people neither sowed their lands nor improved them by any kind of culture living upon milk and flesh and like the Arabs encamping without any fettled habitation In some places they practised no rites of worship though they believed that in the regions above there dwells a Being that governs the world This Deity they call in their language  Oul  The Christianity professed by the people in some parts is so corrupted with superstitions errors and heresies and so mingled with ceremonies borrowed from the Jews that little besides the name of Christianity is to be found among them The Abyssins cannot properly be said to have either cities or houses they live in tents or cottages made of straw or clay very rarely building with stone Their villages or towns consist of these huts yet even of such villages they have but few because the grandees the viceroys and the emperor himself are always in camp that they may be prepared upon the most sudden alarm to meet every emergence in a country which is engaged every year either  in foreign wars or intestine commotions Ethiopia produces very near the same kinds of provision as Portugal though by the extreme laziness of the inhabitants in a much less quantity What the ancients imagined of the torrid zone being a part of the world uninhabitable is so far from being true that the climate is very temperate The blacks have better features than in other countries and are not without wit and ingenuity Their apprehension is quick and their judgement sound There are in this climate two harvests in the year one in winter which lasts through the months of July August and September the other in the spring They have in the greatest plenty raisins peaches pomegranates sugarcanes and some figs Most of these are ripe about Lent which the Abyssins keep with great strictness The animals of the country are the lion the elephant the rhinoceros the unicorn horses mules oxen and cows without number They have a very particular custom which obliges every man that has a thousand cows to save every year one day's milk of all his herd and make a bath with it for his relations This they do so many days  in each year as they have thousands of cattle so that to express how rich a man is they tell you  he bathes so many times  Of the river Nile which has furnished so much controversy we have a full and clear description It is called by the natives ABAVI the Father of Water It rises in SACALA a province of the kingdom of GOIAMA the most fertile and agreeable part of the Abyssinian dominions On the Eastern side of the country on the declivity of a mountain whose descent is so easy that it seems a beautiful plain is that source of the Nile which has been sought after at so much expence and labour This spring or rather these two springs are two holes each about two feet diameter a stone's cast distant from each other One of them is about five feet and a half in depth Lobo was not able to sink his plummet lower perhaps because it was stopped by roots the whole place being full of trees A line of ten feet did not reach the bottom of the other These springs are supposed by the Abyssins to be the vents of a great subterraneous lake At a small distance  to the South is a village called  Guix  through which you ascend to the top of the mountain where there is a little hill which the idolatrous  Agaci  hold in great veneration Their priest calls them together to this place once a year and every one sacrifices a cow or more according to the different degrees of wealth and devotion Hence we have sufficient proof that these nations always paid adoration to the Deity of this famous river  "As to the course of the Nile its waters after their first rise run towards the East about the length of a musketshot then turning Northward continue hidden in the grass and weeds for about a quarter of a league when they reappear amongst a quantity of rocks The Nile from its source proceeds with so inconsiderable a current that it is in danger of being dried up by the hot season but soon receiving an increase from the GEMMA the KELTU the BRANSA and the other smaller rivers it expands to such a breadth in the plains of BOAD which is not above three days journey from its source that a musketball will scarcely fly from one bank to the other  Here it begins to run northward winding however a little to the East for the space of nine or ten leagues and then enters the somuchtalkedof Lake of DAMBIA flowing with such violent rapidity that its waters may be distinguished through the whole passage which is no less than six leagues Here begins the greatness of the Nile Fifteen miles further in the land of ALATA it rushes precipitately from the top of a high rock and forms one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world Lobo says he passed under it without being wet and resting himself for the sake of the coolness was charmed with a thousand delightful rainbows which the sunbeams painted on the water in all their shining and lively colours  This Mr Bruce the late traveller avers to be a downright falsehood He says a deep pool of water reaches to the very foot of the rock and allowing that there was a seat or bench which there is not in the middle of the pool it is absolutely impossible by any exertion of human strength to have arrived at it But it may be asked can Mr Bruce say what was the face of the country in the year when Lobo saw the magnificent sight which he has described Mr Bruce's pool of water may have been formed since and Lobo perhaps was content to sit down without a bench  The  fall of this mighty stream from so great a height makes a noise that may be heard at a considerable distance but it was not found that the neighbouring inhabitants were deaf After the cataract the Nile collects its scattered stream among the rocks which are so near each other that in Lobo's time a bridge of beams on which the whole imperial army passed was laid over them Sultan SEQUED has since built a stone bridge of one arch in the same place for which purpose he procured masons from India Here the river alters its course and passes through various kingdoms such as AMHARA OLACA CHOAA DAMOT and the kingdom of GOIAMA and after various windings returns within a short day's journey of its spring To pursue it through all its mazes and accompany it round the kingdom of GOIAMA is a journey of twentynine days From Abyssinia the river passes into the countries of FAZULO and OMBARCA two vast regions little known inhabited by nations entirely different from the Abyssins Their hair like that of the other blacks in those regions is short and curled In the year RASSELA CHRISTOS Lieutenantgeneral  to Sultan SEQUED entered those kingdoms in a hostile manner but not being able to get intelligence returned without attempting any thing As the empire of Abyssinia terminates at these descents Lobo followed the course of the Nile no farther leaving it to range over barbarous kingdoms and convey wealth and plenty into Aegypt which owes to the annual inundations of this river its envied fertility  After comparing this description with that lately given by Mr Bruce the reader will judge whether Lobo is to lose the honour of having been at the head of the Nile near two centuries before any other European traveller  Lobo knows nothing of the Nile in the rest of its passage except that it receives great increase from many other rivers has several cataracts like that already described and that few fish are to be found in it That scarcity is to be attributed to the  riverhorse  and the  crocodile  which destroy the weaker inhabitants of the river Something likewise must be imputed to the  cataracts  where fish cannot fall without being killed Lobo adds that neither he nor any with whom he conversed about the  crocodile  ever saw him weep and therefore all that  hath been said about his tears must be ranked among the fables invented for the amusement of children  "As to the causes of the inundations of the Nile Lobo observes that many an idle hypothesis has been framed Some theorists ascribe it to the high winds that stop the current and force the water above its banks Others pretend a subterraneous communication between the Ocean and the Nile and that the sea when violently agitated swells the river Many are of opinion that this mighty flood proceeds from the melting of the snow on the mountains of Aethiopia but so much snow and such prodigious heat are never met with in the same region Lobo never saw snow in Abyssinia except on Mount SEMEN in the kingdom of TIGRE very remote from the Nile and on NAMARA which is indeed not far distant but where there never falls snow enough to wet when dissolved the foot of the mountain To the immense labours of the  Portuguese  mankind is indebted for the knowledge of the real cause of these inundations so great and so regular By them we are informed that  Abyssinia where the Nile rises is full of mountains and in its natural situation is much higher than Aegypt that in the winter from June to September no day is without rain that the Nile receives in its course all the rivers brooks and torrents that fall from those mountains and by necessary consequence swelling above its banks fills the plains of Aegypt with inundations which come regularly about the month of July or three weeks after the beginning of the rainy season in Aethiopia The different degrees of this flood are such certain indications of the fruitfulness or sterility of the ensuing year that it is publickly proclaimed at  Cairo  how much the water hath gained during the night"  Such is the account of the Nile and its inundations which it is hoped will not be deemed an improper or tedious digression especially as the whole is an extract from Johnson's translation He is all the time the actor in the scene and in his own words relates the story Having finished this work he returned in February to his native city and in the month of August following published Proposals  for printing by subscription the Latin Poems of Politian with the History of Latin Poetry from the Aera of Petrarch to the time of Politian and also the Life of Politian to be added by the Editor Samuel Johnson The book to be printed in thirty octavo sheets price five shillings It is to be regretted that this project failed for want of encouragement Johnson it seems differed from Boileau Voltaire and D'Alembert who have taken upon them to proscribe all modern efforts to write with elegance in a dead language For a decision pronounced in so high a tone no good reason can be assigned The interests of learning require that the diction of Greece and Rome should be cultivated with care and he who can write a language with correctness will be most likely to understand its idiom its grammar and its peculiar graces of style What man of taste would willingly forego the pleasure of reading  Vida Fracastorius Sannazaro Sirada  and others down to the late elegant productions of Bishop Lowth The history which Johnson proposed to himself would beyond all question have been a valuable addition to the history of letters but  his project failed His next expedient was to offer his assistance to Cave the original projector of the Gentleman's Magazine For this purpose he sent his proposals in a letter offering on reasonable terms occasionally to fill some pages with poems and inscriptions never printed before with fugitive pieces that deserved to be revived and critical remarks on authors ancient and modern Cave agreed to retain him as a correspondent and contributor to the Magazine What the conditions were cannot now be known but certainly they were not sufficient to hinder Johnson from casting his eyes about him in quest of other employment Accordingly in he made overtures to the reverend Mr Budworth Master of a Grammarschool at Brerewood in Staffordshire to become his assistant This proposition did not succeed Mr Budworth apprehended that the involuntary motions to which Johnson's nerves were subject might make him an object of ridicule with his scholars and by consequence lessen their respect for their master Another mode of advancing himself presented itself about this time Mrs Porter the widow of a mercer in Birmingham  admired his talents It is said that she had about eight hundred pounds and that sum to a person in Johnson's circumstances was an affluent fortune A marriage took place and to turn his wife's money to the best advantage he projected the scheme of an academy for education Gilbert Walmsley at that time Register of the Ecclesiastical Court of the Bishop of Lichfield was distinguished by his erudition and the politeness of his manners He was the friend of Johnson and by his weight and influence endeavoured to promote his interest The celebrated Garrick whose father Captain Garrick lived at Lichfield was placed in the new seminary of education by that gentleman's advice Garrick was then about eighteen years old An accession of seven or eight pupils was the most that could be obtained though notice was given by a public advertisement  See the Gentleman's Magazine for p  that at Edial near Lichfield in Staffordshire young Gentlemen are boarded and taught the Latin and Greek Languages by Samuel Johnson  The undertaking proved abortive Johnson having now abandoned all hopes of promoting his fortune in the country determined to become an adventurer in the world at large His young pupil Garrick had formed the same resolution and accordingly in March they arrived in London together Two such candidates for same perhaps never before that day entered the metropolis together Their stock of money was soon exhaussted In his visionary project of an academy Johnson had probably wasted his wife's substance and Garrick's father had little more than his halfpay The two fellowtravellers had the world before them and each was to chuse his road to fortune and to fame They brought with them genius and powers of mind peculiarly formed by nature for the different vocations to which each of them felt himself inclined They acted from the impulse of young minds even then meditating great things and with courage anticipating success Their friend Mr Walmsley by a letter to the Rev Mr Colson who it seems was a great mathematician exerted his good offices in their favour He  gave notice of their intended journey  Davy Garrick  he said  will be with you next week and Johnson to try his fate with a tragedy and to get himself employed in some translation either from the Latin or French Johnson is a very good scholar and a poet and I have great hopes will turn out a fine tragedywriter If it should be in your way I doubt not but you will be ready to recommend and assist your countrymen  Of Mr Walmsley's merit and the excellence of his character Johnson has left a beautiful testimonial at the end of the Life of Edward Smith It is reasonable to conclude that a mathematician absorbed in abstract speculations was not able to find a sphere of action for two men who were to be the architects of their own fortune In three or four years afterwards Garrick came forth with talents that astonished the publick He began his career at Goodman'sfields and there  monstratus fatis Vespasianus  he chose a lucrative profession and consequently soon emerged from all his difficulties Johnson was left to toil in the humble walks of literature A tragedy as appears by Walmsley's letter was the whole  of his stock This most probably was IRENE but if then finished it was doomed to wait for a more happy period It was offered to Fleetwood and rejected Johnson looked round him for employment Having while he remained in the country corresponded with Cave under a feigned name he now thought it time to make himself known to a man whom he considered as a patron of literature Cave had announced by public advertisement a prize of fifty pounds for the best Poem on Life Death Judgement Heaven and Hell and this circumstance diffused an idea of his liberality Johnson became connected with him in business and in a close and intimate acquaintance Of Cave's character it is unnecessary to say any thing in this place as Johnson was afterwards the biographer of his first and most useful patron To be engaged in the translation of some important book was still the object which Johnson had in view For this purpose he proposed to give the History of the Council of Trent with copious notes then lately added to a French edition Twelve sheets of this work were printed for which Johnson received fortynine  pounds as appears by his receipt in the possession of Mr Nichols the compiler of that entertaining and useful work the Gentleman's Magazine Johnson's translation was never completed a like design was offered to the publick under the patronage of Dr Zachary Pearce and by that contention both attempts were frustrated Johnson had been commended by Pope for the translation of the Messiah into Latin verse but he knew no approach to so eminent a man With one however who was connected with Pope he became acquainted at St John's Gate and that person was no other than the wellknown Richard Savage whose life was afterwards written by Johnson with great elegance and a depth of moral reflection Savage was a man of considerable talents His address his various accomplishments and above all the peculiarity of his misfortunes recommended him to Johnson's notice They became united in the closest intimacy Both had great parts and they were equally under the pressure of want Sympathy joined them in a league of friendship Johnson has been often heard to relate that he and Savage walked round Grosvenorsquare  till four in the morning in the course of their conversation reforming the world dethroning princes establishing new forms of government and giving laws to the several states of Europe till fatigued at length with their legislative office they began to feel the want of refreshment but could not muster up more than four pence halfpenny Savage it is true had many vices but vice could never strike its roots in a mind like Johnson's seasoned early with religion and the principles of moral rectitude His first prayer was composed in the year He had not at that time renounced the use of wine and no doubt occasionally enjoyed his friend and his bottle The love of late hours which followed him through life was perhaps originally contracted in company with Savage However that may be their connection was not of long duration In the year Savage was reduced to the last distress Mr Pope in a letter to him expressed his concern for  the miserable withdrawing of his pension after the death of the Queen  and gave him hopes that  in a short time he should find himself supplied with a competence  without any dependance on those little creatures whom we are pleased to call the Great  The scheme proposed to him was that he should retire to Swansea in Wales and receive an allowance of fifty pounds a year to be raised by subscription Pope was to pay twenty pounds This plan though finally established took more than a year before it was carried into execution In the mean time the intended retreat of Savage called to Johnson's mind the third satire of Juvenal in which that poet takes leave of a friend who was withdrawing himself from all the vices of Rome Struck with this idea he wrote that wellknown Poem called London The first lines manifestly point to Savage  "Though grief and fondness in my breast rebel  "When injured Thales bids the town farewell  "Yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend"  "I praise the hermit but regret the friend  "Reserv'd at length from Vice and London far  "To breathe in distant fields a purer air  "And fix'd or Cambria's solitary shore  "Give to St David one true Briton more"  Johnson at that time lodged at Greenwich He there fixes the scene and takes leave of  his friend who he says in his Life parted from him with tears in his eyes The poem when finished was offered to Cave It happened however that the late Mr Dodsley was the purchaser at the price of ten guineas It was published and Pope we are told said  The author whoever he is will not be long concealed  alluding to the passage in Terence  Ubi ubi est diu celari non potest  Notwithstanding that prediction it does not appear that besides the copymoney any advantage accrued to the author of a poem written with the elegance and energy of Pope Johnson in August went with all the same of his poetry to offer himself a candidate for the mastership of the school at Appleby in Leicestershire The statutes of the place required that the person chosen should be a master of arts To remove this objection the late Lord Gower was induced to write to a friend in order to obtain for Johnson a master's degree in the University of Dublin by the recommendation of Dr Swift The letter was printed in one of the magazines and is as follows  SIR  Mr Samuel Johnson author of London a satire and some other poetical pieces is a native of this county and much respected by some worthy gentlemen in the neighbourhood who are trustees of a charityschool now vacant the certain salary of which is sixty pounds  per  year of which they are desirous to make him master but unfortunately he is not capable of receiving their bounty which would make him happy for life by not being a master of arts which by the statutes of the school the master of it must be  Now these gentlemen do me the honour to think that I have interest enough in you to prevail upon you to write to Dean Swift to persuade the University of Dublin to send a diploma to me constituting this poor man master of arts in their University They highly extol the man's learning and probity and will not be persuaded that the University will make any difficulty of conferring such a favour upon a stranger if he is recommended by the Dean They say he is not  afraid of the strictest examination though he is of so long a journey and yet he will venture it if the Dean thinks it necessary chusing rather to die upon the road than to be starved to death in translating for booksellers which has been his only subsistence for some time past  I fear there is more difficulty in this affair than these goodnatured gentlemen apprehend especially as their election cannot be delayed longer than the th of next month If you see this matter in the same light that it appears to me I hope you will burn this and pardon me for giving you so much trouble about an impracticable thing but if you think there is a probability of obtaining the favour asked I am sure your humanity and propensity to relieve merit in distress will incline you to serve the poor man without my adding any more to the trouble I have already given you than assuring you that I am with great truth Sir  Your faithful humble servant GOWER  Trentham  Aug st  This scheme miscarried There is reason to think that Swift declined to meddle in the business and to that circumstance Johnson's known dislike of Swift has been often imputed  It is mortifying to pursue a man of merit through all his difficulties and yet this narrative must be through many following years the history of Genius and Virtue struggling with Adversity Having lost the school at Appleby Johnson was thrown back on the metropolis Bred to no profession without relations friends or interest he was condemned to drudgery in the service of Cave his only patron In November was published a translation of Crousaz's Examen of Pope's Essay on Man  containing a succinct View of the System of the Fatalists and a Confutation of their Opinions with an Illustration of the Doctrine of Free Will and an Enquiry what view Mr Pope might have in touching upon the Leibnitzian Philosophy and Fatalism By Mr Crousaz Professor or Philosophy and Mathematics at Lausanne  This translation has been generally  thought a production of Johnson's pen but it is now known that Mrs Elizabeth Carter has acknowledged it to be one of her early performances It is certain however that Johnson was eager to promote the publication He considered the foreign philosopher as a man zealous in the cause of religion and with him he was willing to join against the system of the Fatalists and the doctrine of Leibnitz It is well known that Warburton wrote a vindication of Mr Pope but there is reason to think that Johnson conceived an early prejudice against the Essay on Man and what once took root in a mind like his was not easily eradicated His letter to Cave on this subject is still extant and may well justify Sir John Hawkins who inferred that Johnson was the translator of Crousaz The conclusion of the letter is remarkable  I am yours IMPRANSUS  If by that Latin word was meant that he had not dined because he wanted the means who can read it even at this hour without an aching heart  With a mind naturally vigorous and quickened by necessity Johnson formed a multiplicity of projects but most of them proved abortive A number of small tracts issued  from his pen with wonderful rapidity such as  MARMOR NORFOLCIENSE or an Essay on an ancient prophetical Inscription in Monkish Rhyme discovered at Lynn in Norfolk By  Probus Britannicus  This was a pamphlet against Sir Robert Walpole According to Sir John Hawkins a warrant was issued to apprehend the Author who reretired with his wife to an obscure lodging near Lambeth Marsh and there eluded the search or the messengers But this story has no foundation in truth Johnson was never known to mention such an incident in his life and Mr Steele late of the Treasury caused diligent search to be made at the proper offices and no trace of such a proceeding could be found In the same year  the Lord Chamberlain prohibited the representation of a tragedy called GUSTAVUS VASA by Henry Brooke Under the mask of irony Johnson published  A Vindication of the Licencer from the malicious and scandalous Aspersions of Mr Brooke  Of these two pieces Sir John Hawkins says  they have neither learning nor wit nor a single ray of that genius which has since blazed forth  but as they have been lately reprinted the reader  who wishes to gratify his curiosity is referred to the fourteenth volume of Johnson's works published by Stockdale The lives of Boerhaave Blake Barratier Father Paul and others were about that time printed in the Gentleman's Magazine The subscription of fifty pounds a year for Savage was completed and in July Johnson parted with the companion of his midnighthours never to see him more The separation was perhaps an advantage to him who wanted to make a right use of his time and even then beheld with selfreproach the waste occasioned by dissipation His abstinence from wine and strong liquors began soon after the departure of Savage What habits he contracted in the course of that acquaintance cannot now be known The ambition of excelling in conversation and that pride of victory which at times disgraced a man of Johnson's genius were perhaps native blemishes A fierce spirit of independence even in the midst of poverty may be seen in Savage and if not thence transfused by Johnson into his own manners it may at least be supposed to have gained strength from the example before him During that connection there was if we believe Sir  John Hawkins a short separation between our author and his wife but a reconciliation soon took place Johnson loved her and shewed his affection in various modes of gallantry which Garrick used to render ridiculous by his mimicry The affectation of soft and fashionable airs did not become an unwieldy figure his admiration was received by the wife with the slutter of an antiquated coquette and both it is well known furnished matter for the lively genius of Garrick  It is a mortifying reflection that Johnson with a store of learning and extraordinary talents was not able at the age of thirty to force his way to the favour of the publick  Slow rises worth by poverty depress'd  He was still  as he says himself  to provide for the day that was passing over him  He saw Cave involved in a state of warfare with the numerous competitors at that time struggling with the Gentleman's Magazine and gratitude for such supplies as Johnson received dictated a Latin Ode on the subject of that contention The first lines  "Urbane nullis fesse laboribus  "Urbane nullis victe calumniis"  put one in mind of Casimir's Ode to Pope Urban  "Urbane regum maxime maxime  "Urbane vatum"  The Polish poet was probably at that time in the hands of a man who had meditated the history of the Latin poets Guthrie the historian had from July composed the parliamentary speeches for the Magazines but from the beginning of the session which opened on the th of November Johnson succeeded to that department and continued it from that time to the debate on spirituous liquors which happened in the House of Lords in February The eloquence the force of argument and the splendor of language displayed in the several speeches are well known and univesally admired The whole has been collected in two volumes by Mr Stockdale and may form a proper supplement to this edition That Johnson was the author of the debates during that period was not generally known but the secret transpired several years afterwards and was avowed by himself on the following occasion Mr Wedderburne now Lord Loughborough  Dr Johnson Dr Francis the translator of Horace the present writer and others dined with the late Mr Foote An important debate towards the end of Sir Robert Walpole's administration being mentioned Dr Francis observed  That Mr Pitt's speech on that occasion was the best he had ever read  He added  That he had employed eight years of his life in the study of Demosthenes and finished a translation of that celebrated orator with all the decorations of style and language within the reach of his capacity but he had met with nothing equal to the speech abovementioned  Many of the company remembered the debate and some passages were cited with the approbation and applause of all present During the ardour of conversation Johnson remained silent As soon as the warmth of praise subsided he opened with these words  That speech I wrote in a garret in Exeterstreet  The company was struck with astonishment After staring at each other in silent amaze Dr Francis asked  How that speech could be written by him  "Sir" said Johnson  I wrote it in Exeterstreet I never had been in the  gallery of the House of Commons but once Cave had interest with the doorkeepers He and the persons employed under him gained admittance they brought away the subject of discussion the names of the speakers the side they took and the order in which they rose together with notes of the arguments advanced in the course of the debate The whole was afterwards communicated to me and I composed the speeches in the form which they now have in the Parliamentary debates  To this discovery Dr Francis made answer  Then Sir you have exceeded Demosthenes himself for to say that you have exceeded Francis's Demosthenes would be saying nothing  The rest of the company bestowed lavish encomiums on Johnson one in particular praised his impartiality observing that he dealt out reason and eloquence with an equal hand to both parties That is not quite true said Johnson  I saved appearances tolerably well but I took care that the  WHIG DOGS  should not have the best of it  The sale of the Magazine was greatly increased by the Parliamentary debates which were continued by  Johnson till the month of March From that time the Magazine was conducted by Dr Hawkesworth  In Osborne the bookseller who kept a shop in Gray'sInn purchased the Earl of Oxford's library at the price of thirteen thousand pounds He projected a catalogue in five octavo volumes at five shillings each Johnson was employed in that painful drudgery He was likewise to collect all such small tracts as were in any degree worth preserving in order to reprint and publish the whole in a collection called "The Harleian Miscellany" The catalogue was completed and the Miscellany in was published in eight quarto volumes In this business Johnson was a daylabourer for immediate subsistence not unlike Gustavus Vasa working in the mines of Dalicarlia What Wilcox a bookseller of eminence in the Strand said to Johnson on his first arrival in town was now almost confirmed He lent our author five guineas and then asked him  How do you mean to earn your livelihood in this town  "By my literary labours" was the answer Wilcox staring at him shook  his head  By your literary laboursYou had better buy a porter's knot  Johnson used to tell this anecdote to Mr Nichols but he said  Wilcox was one of my best friends and he meant well  In fact Johnson while employed in Gray'sInn may be said to have carried a porter's knot He paused occasionally to peruse the book that came to his hand Osborne thought that such curiosity tended to nothing but delay and objected to it with all the pride and insolence of a man who knew that he paid daily wages In the dispute that of course ensued Osborne with that roughness which was natural to him enforced his argument by giving the lie Johnson seized a folio and knocked the bookseller down This story has been related as an instance of Johnson's ferocity but merit cannot always take the spurns of the unworthy with a patient spirit  That the history of an author must be found in his works is in general a true observation and was never more apparent than in the present narrative Every aera of Johnson's life is fixed by his writings In he published the Life of Savage and then projected a new  edition of Shakspeare As a prelude to this design he published in  Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth with Remarks on Sir Thomas Hanmer's Edition to which were prefixed Proposals for a new Edition of Shakspeare with a Specimen  Of this pamphlet Warburton in the Preface to Shakspeare has given his opinion  As to all those things which have been published under the title of Essays Remarks Observations c on Shakspeare if you except some critical notes on  Macbeth  given as a specimen of a projected edition and written as appears by a man of parts and genius the rest are absolutely below a serious notice  But the attention of the publick was not excited there was no friend to promote a subscription and the project died to revive at a future day A new undertaking however was soon after proposed namely an English Dictionary upon an enlarged plan Several of the most opulent booksellers had meditated a work of this kind and the agreement was soon adjusted between the parties Emboldened by this connection Johnson thought of a better habitation than he had hitherto  known He had lodged with his wife in courts and alleys about the Strand but now for the purpose of carrying on his arduous undertaking and to be near his printer and friend Mr Strahan he ventured to take a house in Goughsquare Fleetstreet He was told that the Earl of Chesterfield was a friend to his undertaking and in consequence of that intelligence he published in  The Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language addrssed to the Right Honourable Philip Dormer Earl of Chesterfield one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State  Mr Whitehead afterwards Poet Laureat undertook to convey the manuscript to his Lordship the consequence was an invitation from Lord Chesterfield to the author A stronger contrast of characters could not be brought together the Nobleman celebrated for his wit and all the graces of polite behaviour the Author conscious of his own merit towering in idea above all competition versed in scholastic logic but a stranger to the arts of polite conversation uncouth vehement and vociferous The coalition was too unnatural Johnson expected a Maecenas and was disappointed No patronage no asistance followed Visits  were repeated but the reception was not cordial Johnson one day was left a full hour waiting in an antichamber till a gentleman should retire and leave his Lordship at leisure This was the famous Colley Cibber Johnson saw him go and fired with indignation rushed out of the house What Lord Chesterfield thought of his visitor may be seen in a passage in one of that Nobleman's letters to his son  Letter CCXII    There is a man whose moral character deep learning and superior parts I acknowledge admire and respect but whom it is so impossible for me to love that I am almost in a fever whenever I am in his company His figure without being deformed seems made to disgrace or ridicule the common structure of the human body His legs and arms are never in the position which according to the situation of his body they ought to be in but constantly employed in committing acts of hostility upon the Graces He throws any where but down his throat whatever he means to drink and mangles what he means to carve Inattentive to all the regards of social life he mistimes and  misplaces every thing He disputes with heat indiscriminately mindless of the rank character and situation of those with whom he disputes Absolutely ignorant of the several gradations of familiarity and respect he is exactly the same to his superiors his equals and his inferiors and therefore by a necessary consequence is absurd to two of the three Is it possible to love such a man No The utmost I can do for him is to consider him a respectable Hottentot  Such was the idea entertained by Lord Chesterfield After the incident of Colley Cibber Johnson never repeated his visits In his high and decisive tone he has been often heard to say  Lord Chesterfield is a Wit among Lords and a Lord among Wits  In the course of the year Garrick in conjunction with Lacy became patentee of Drurylane Playhouse For the opening of the theatre at the usual time Johnson wrote for his friend the wellknown prologue which to say no more of it may at least be placed on a level with Pope's to the tragedy of Cato The playhouse being now under Garrick's  direction Johnson thought the opportunity fair to think of his tragedy of Irene which was his whole stock on his first arrival in town in the year That play was accordingly put into rehearsal in January As a precursor to prepare the way and awaken the public attention  The Vanity of Human Wishes  a Poem in Imitation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal by the Author of  London  was published in the same month In the Gentleman's Magazine for February we find that the tragedy of  Irene  was acted at Drurylane on Monday February the th and from that time without interruption to Monday February the th being in all thirteen nights Since that time it has not been exhibited on any stage  Irene  may be added to some other plays in our language which have lost their place in the theatre but continue to please in the closet During the representation of this piece Johnson attended every night behind the scenes Conceiving that his character as an author required some ornament for his person he chose upon that occasion to decorate himself with a handsome waistcoat and a goldlaced hat The late Mr Topham Beauclerc  who had had a great deal of that humour which pleases the more for seeming undesigned used to give a pleasant description of this Greenroom finery as related by the author himself "But" said Johnson with great gravity  I soon laid aside my goldlaced hat lest it should make me proud  The amount of the three benefit nights for the tragedy of  Irene  it is to be feared was not very considerable as the profit that stimulating motive never invited the author to another dramatic attempt Some years afterwards when the present writer was intimate with Garrick and knew Johnson to be in distress he asked the manager why he did not produce another tragedy for his Lichfield friend Garrick's answer was remarkable  When Johnson writes  tragedy declamation roars and passion sleeps  when Shakspeare wrote he dipped his pen in his own heart  There may perhaps be a degree of sameness in this regular way of tracing an author from one work to another and the reader may feel the effect of a tedious monotony but in the life of Johnson there are no other landmarks  He was now forty years old and had mixed but little with the world He followed no profession transacted no business and was a stranger to what is called a townlife We are now arrived at the brightest period he had hitherto known His name broke out upon mankind with a degree of lustre that promised a triumph over all his difficulties The Life of Savage was admired as a beautiful and instructive piece of biography The two Imitations of Juvenal were thought to rival even the excellence of Pope and the tragedy of  Irene  though uninteresting on the stage was universally admired in the closet for the propriety of the sentiments the richness of the language and the general harmony of the whole composition His fame was widely diffused and he had made his agreement with the booksellers for his English Dictionary at the sum of fifteen hundred guineas part of which was to be from time to time advanced in proportion to the progress of the work This was a certain fund for his support without being obliged to write fugitive pieces for the petty supplies of the day Accordingly we find that in he established a club consisting of ten in number  at Horseman's in Ivylane on every Tuesday evening This is the first scene of social life to which Johnson can be traced out of his own house The members of this little society were Samuel Johnson Dr Salter father of the late Master of the Charterhouse Dr Hawkesworth Mr Ryland a merchant Mr Payne a bookseller in Paternosterrow Mr Samuel Dyer a learned young man Dr William M'Ghie a Scotch physician Dr Edmund Barker a young physician Dr Bathurst another young physician and Sir John Hawkins This list is given by Sir John as it should seem with no other view than to draw a spiteful and malevolent character of almost every one of them Mr Dyer whom Sir John says he loved with the affection of a brother meets with the harshest treatment because it was his maxim that  to live in peace with mankind and in a temper to do good offices was the most essential part of our duty  That notion of moral goodness gave umbrage to Sir John Hawkins and drew down upon the memory of his friend the bitterest imputations Mr Dyer however was admired and loved through life He was a  man of literature Johnson loved to enter with him into a discussion of metaphysical moral and critical subjects in those conflicts exercising his talents and according to his custom always contending for victory Dr Bathurst was the person on whom Johnson fixed his affection He hardly ever spoke of him without tears in his eyes It was from him who was a native of Jamaica that Johnson received into his service Frank the black servant whom on account of his master he valued to the end of his life At the time of instituting the club in Ivylane Johnson had projected the  Rambler  The title was most probably suggested by the  Wanderer  a poem which he mentions with the warmest praise in the Life of Savage With the same spirit of independence with which he wished to live it was now his pride to write He communicated his plan to none of his friends he desired no assistance relying entirely on his own fund and the protection of the Divine Being which he implored in a solemn form of prayer composed by himself for the occasion Having formed a resolution to undertake a work that might be of use and honour to his country  he thought with Milton that this was not to be obtained  but by devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit that can enrich with all utterance and knowledge and send out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his altar to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases  Having invoked the special protection of Heaven and by that act of piety fortified his mind he began the great work of the  Rambler  The first number was published on Tuesday March the th and from that time was continued regularly every Tuesday and Saturday for the space of two years when it finally closed on Saturday March As it began with motives of piety so it appears that the same religious spirit glowed with unabating ardour to the last His conclusion is  The Essays professedly serious if I have been able to execute my own intentions will be found exactly conformable to the precepts of Christianity without any accommodation to the licentiousness and levity of the present age I therefore look back on this part of my work with pleasure  which no man shall diminish or augment I shall never envy the honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cause if I can be numbered among the writers who have given ardour to virtue and confidence to truth  The whole number of Essays amounted to two hundred and eight Addison's in the Spectator are more in number but not half in point of quantity Addison was not bound to publish on stated days he could watch the ebb and flow of his genius and send his paper to the press when his own taste was satisfied Johnson's case was very different He wrote singly and alone In the whole progress of the work he did not receive more than ten essays This was a scanty contribution For the rest the author has described his fituation  He that condemns himself to compose on a stated day will often bring to his task an attention dissipated a memory embarrassed an imagination overwhelmed a mind distracted with anxieties a body languishing with disease he will labour on a barren topic till it is too late to change it or in the ardour of invention diffuse his thoughts into wild exuberance which the pressing hour of publication  cannot suffer judgement to examine or reduce  Of this excellent production the number sold on each day did not amount to five hundred of course the bookseller who paid the author four guineas a week did not carry on a successful trade His generosity and perseverance deserve to be commended and happily when the collection appeared in volumes were amply rewarded Johnson lived to see his labours flourish in a tenth edition His posterity as an ingenious French writer has said on a similar occasion began in his lifetime  In the beginning of soon after the  Rambler  was set on foot Johnson was induced by the arts of a vile impostor to lend his assistance during a temporary delusion to a fraud not to be paralleled in the annals of literature One LAUDER a native of Scotland who had been a teacher in the University of EDINBURGH had conceived a mortal antipathy to the name and character of Milton His reason was because the prayer of Pamela in Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia was as he supposed maliciously inserted by the great poet in  an edition of the Eikon Basilike in order to fix an imputation of impiety on the memory of the murdered king Fired with resentment and willing to reap the profits of a gross imposition this man collected from several Latin poets such as Masenius the Jesuit Staphorstius a Dutch divine Beza and others all such passages as bore any kind of resemblance to different places in the Paradise Lost and these he published from time to time in the Gentleman's Magazine with occasional interpolations of lines which he himself translated from Milton The public credulity swallowed all with eagerness and Milton was supposed to be guilty of plagiarism from inferior modern writers The fraud succeeded so well that Lauder collected the whole into a volume and advertised it under the title of  An Essay on Milton's Use and Imitation of the Moderns in his Paradise Lost dedicated to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge  While the book was in the press the proofsheets were shewn to Johnson at the Ivylane Club by Payne the bookleller who was one of the members No man in that society was in possession of the authors from whom Lauder  professed to make his extracts The charge was believed and the contriver of it found his way to Johnson who is represented by Sir John Hawkins not indeed as an accomplice in the fraud but through motives of malignity to Milton delighting in the detection and exulting that the poet's reputation would suffer by the discovery More malice to a deceased friend cannot well be imagined Hawkins adds  that he wished well to the argument must be inferred from the preface which indubitably was written by him  The preface it is well known was written by Johnson and for that reason is inserted in this edition But if Johnson approved of the argument it was no longer than while he believed it founded in truth Let us advert to his own words in that very preface  Among the enquiries to which the ardour of criticism has naturally given occasion none is more obscure in itself or more worthy of rational curiosity than a retrospection of the progress of this mighty genius in the construction of his work a view of the fabric gradually rising perhaps from small beginnings till its foundation rests in the centre and its turrets  sparkle in the skies to trace back the structure through all its varieties to the simplicity of the first plan to find what was projected whence the scheme was taken how it was improved by what assistance it was executed and from what stores the materials were collected whether its founder dug them from the quarries of nature or demolished other buildings to embellish his own  These were the motives that induced Johnson to assist Lauder with a preface and are not these the motives of a critic and a scholar What reader of taste what man of real knowledge would not think his time well employed in an enquiry so curious so interesting and instructive If Lauder's facts were really true who would not be glad without the smalest tincture of malevolence to receive real information It is painful to be thus obliged to vindicate a man who in his heart towered above the petty arts of fraud and imposition against an injudicious biographer who undertook to be his editor and the protector of his memory Another writer Dr Towers in an Essay on the Life and Character of Dr Johnson seems to countenance this calumny  He says  It can hardly be doubted but that Johnson's aversion to Milton's politics was the cause of that alacrity with which he joined with Lauder in his infamous attack on our great epic poet and which induced him to assist in that transaction  These words would seem to describe an accomplice were they not immediately followed by an express declaration that Johnson was  unacquainted with the imposture  Dr Towers adds  It seems to have been by way of making some compensation to the memory of Milton for the share he had in the attack of Lauder that Johnson wrote the prologue spoken by Garrick at Drurylane Theatre on the performance of the Masque of Comus for the benefit of Milton's granddaughter  Dr Towers is not free from prejudice but as Shakspeare has it  he begets a temperance to give it smoothness  He is therefore entitled to a dispassionate answer When Johnson wrote the prologue it does appear that he was aware of the malignant artifices practised by Lauder In the postscript to Johnson's preface a subscription is proposed for relieving the granddaughter of the author of Paradise Lost Dr Towers will agree that this shews  Johnson's alacrity in doing good That alacrity shewed itself again in the letter printed in the European Magazine January and there said to have appeared originally in the General Advertiser th April by which the publick were invited to embrace the opportunity of paying a just regard to the illustrious dead united with the pleasure of doing good to the living The letter adds  To assist industrious indigence struggling with distress and debilitated by age is a display of virtue and an acquisition of happiness and honour Whoever therefore would be thought capable of pleasure in reading the works of our incomparable Milton and not so destitute of gratitude as to refuse to lay out a trifle in a rational and elegant entertainment for the benefit of his living remains for the exercise of their own virtue the increase of their reputation and the consciousness of doing good should appear at Drurylane Theatre tomorrow April when COMUS will be performed for the benefit of Mrs Elizabeth Foster granddaughter to the author and the only surviving branch of his family  Nota bene  there will be a  new prologue on the occasion written by the author of Irene and spoken by Mr Garrick  The man who had thus exerted himself to serve the granddaughter cannot be supposed to have entertained personal malice to the grandfather It is true that the malevolence of Lauder as well as the impostures of Archibald Bower were fully detected by the labours in the cause of truth of the Rev Dr Douglas now Lord Bishop of Salisbury  "Diram qui contudit Hydram  "Notaque fatali portenta labore subegit"  But the pamphlet entituled  Milton vindicated from the Charge of Plagiarism brought against him by Mr Lauder and Lauder himself convicted of several Forgeries and gross Impositions on the Publick By John Douglas M A Rector of Eaton Constantine Salop  was not published till the year In that work p Dr Douglas says  It is to be hoped nay it is  expected  that the elegant and nervous writer whose judicious sentiments and inimitable style point out the author of Lauder's preface and postscript will no longer allow A MAN to  plume himself with his feathers  who appears so little to have deserved  his assistance an assistance which I am persuaded would never have been communicated had there been the least suspicion of those facts which I have been the instrument of conveying to the world  We have here a contemporary testimony to the integrity of Dr Johnson throughout the whole of that vile transaction What was the consequence of the requisition made by Dr Douglas Johnson whose ruling passion may be said to be the love of truth convinced Lauder that it would be more for his interest to make a full confession of his guilt than to stand forth the convicted champion of a lye and for this purpose he drew up in the strongest terms a recantation in a Letter to the Rev Mr Douglas which Lauder signed and published in the year That piece will remain a lasting memorial of the abhorrence with which Johnson beheld a violation of truth Mr Nichols whose attachment to his illustrious friend was unwearied shewed him in a book called  Remarks on Johnson's Life of Milton  in which the affair of Lauder was renewed with virulence and a  poetical scale  in the Literary Magazine when Johnson had ceased to write in that collection was urged as an  additional proof of deliberate malice He read the libellous passage with attention and instantly wrote on the margin  In the business of Lauder I was deceived partly by thinking the man too frantic to be fraudulent Of the  poetical scale  quoted from the Magazine I am not the author I fancy it was put in after I had quitted that work for I not only did not write it but I do not remember it  As a critic and a scholar Johnson was willing to receive what numbers at the time believed to be true information when he found that the whole was a forgery he renounced all connection with the author  In March he felt a severe stroke of affliction in the death of his wife The last number of the Rambler as already mentioned was on the th of that month The loss of Mrs Johnson was then approaching and probably was the cause that put an end to those admirable periodical essays It appears that she died on the th of March in a memorandum at the foot of the Prayers and Meditations that is called her Dying Day She was buried at Bromley under the care of Dr Hawkesworth Johnson placed a Latin inscription on  her tomb in which he celebrated her beauty With the singularity of his prayers for his deceased wife from that time to the end of his days the world is sufficiently acquainted On Easterday d April his memorandum says  Thought on Tetty poor dear Tetty with my eyes full Went to Church After sermon I recommended Tetty in a prayer by herself and my father mother brother and Bathurst in another I did it only once so far as it might be lawful for me  In a prayer January the day on which his mother was buried he commends as far as may be lawful her soul to God imploring for her whatever is most beneficial to her in her present state In this habit he perservered to the end of his days The Rev Mr Strahan the editor of the Prayers and Meditation observes  That Johnson on some occasions prays that the Almighty may have had merry on his wife and Mr Thrale evidently sapposing their sentence to have been already passed in the Divine Mind and by consequence proving that he had no belief in a state of purgatory and no reason for praying for the dead that could impeach the sincerity of his profession as a  Protestant  Mr Strahan adds  That in praying for the regretted tenants of the grave Johnson conformed to a practice which has been retained by many learned members of the Established Church though the Liturgy no longer admits it  If where the tree salleth there it shall be  if our state at the close of life is to be the measure of our final sentence then prayers for the dead being visibly fruitless can be regarded only as the vain oblations of superstition But of all superstitions this perhaps is one of the least unamiable and most incident to a good mind If our sensations of kindness be intense those whom we have revered and loved death cannot wholly seclude from our concern It is true for the reason just mentioned such evidences of our surviving affection may be thought illjudged but surely they are generous and some natural tenderness is due even to a superstition which thus originates in piety and benevolence  These sentences extracted from the Rev Mr Strahan's preface if they are not a full justisication are at least a beautiful apology It will not be improper to add what Johnson himself has said on the subject Being  asked by Mr Boswell  Life of Johnson Vol I p  what he thought of purgatory as believed by the Roman Catholics His answer was  It is a very harmless doctrine They are of opinion that the generality of mankind are neither so obstinately wicked as to deserve everlasting punishment nor so good as to merit being admitted into the society of blessed spirits and therefore that God is graciously pleased to allow a middle state where they may be purified by certain degrees of suffering You see there is nothing unreasonable in this and if it be once established that there are souls in purgatory it is as proper to pray for them as for our brethren of mankind who are yet in this life  This was Dr Johnson's guess into futurity and to guess is the utmost that man can do  Shadows clouds and darkness rest upon it  Mrs Johnson left a daughter Lucy Porter by her first husband She had contracted a friendship with Mrs Anne Williams the daughter of Zachary Williams a physician of eminence in South Wales who had devoted more than thirty years of a long life to the study of  the longitude and was thought to have made great advances towards that important discovery His letters to Lord Halifax and the Lords of the Admiralty partly corrected and partly written by Dr Johnson are still extant in the hands of Mr Nichols  See Gentleman's Magazine for Nov and Dec  We there find Dr Williams in the eightythird year of his age stating that he had prepared an instrument which might be called an epitome or miniature of the terraqueous globe sliewing with the assistance of tables constructed by himself the variations of the magnetic needle and ascertaining the longitude for the safety of navigation It appears that this scheme had been referred to Sir Isaac Newton but that great philosopher excusing himself on account of his advanced age all applications were useless till when the subject was referred by order of Lord Anson to Dr Bradley the celebrated professor of asironomy His report was unfavourable  Ibid for Dec p  though it allows that a considerable progress had been made Dr Williams after all his labour and expence died in a short time after a melancholy instance of unrewarded merit  His daughter possessed uncommon talents and though blind had an alacrity of mind that made her conversation agreeable and even desirable To relieve and appease melancholy reflections Johnson took her home to his house in Goughsquare In Garrick gave her a benefitplay which produced two hundred pounds In she published by subscription a quarto volume of Miscellanies and incrensed her little stock to three hundred pounds That fund with Johnson's protection supported her through the remainder of her life  During the two years in which the Rambler was carried on the Dictionary proceeded by slow degrees In May having composed a prayer preparatory to his return from tears and sorrow to the duties of life he resumed his grand design and went on with vigour giving however occasional assistance to his friend Dr Hawkesworth in the Adventurer which began soon after the Rambler was laid aside Some of the most valuable essays in that collection were from the pen of Johnson The Dictionary was completed towards the end of and Cave being then no more it was a mortification to the author of that noble addition to our  language that his old friend did not live to fee the triumph of his labours In May that great work was published Johnson was desirous that it should come from one who had obtained academical honours and for that purpose his friend the Rev Thomas Warton obtained for him in the preceding month of February a diploma for a matter's degree from the University of Oxford Garrick on the publication of the Dictionary wrote the following lines  "Talk of war with a Briton he 'll boldly advance  "That one English soldier can beat ten of France  "Would we alter the boast from the sword to the "pen  "Our odds are still greater still greater our men  "In the deep mines of science though Frenchmen "may toil  "Can their strength be compar'd to Locke Newton "or Boyle  "Let them rally their heroes send forth all their "pow'rs  "Their versemen and prosemen then match them "with ours  "First Shakspeare and Milton like Gods in the fight  "Have put their whole drama and epic to slight  "In satires epistles and odes would they cope  "Their numbers retreat before Dryden and Pope  "And Johnson well arm'd like a hero of yore  "Has beat Forty French and will beat Forty more  It is perhaps needless to mention that Forty was the number of the French Academy at the time when their Dictionary was published to settle their language  In the course of the winter preceding this grand publication the late Earl of Chesterfield gave two essays in the periodical Paper called THE WORLD dated November and December to prepare the publick for so important a work The original plan addressed to his Lordship in the year is there mentioned in terms of the highest praise and this was understood at the time to be a courtly way of soliciting a dedication of the Dictionary to himself Johnson treated this civility with disdain He said to Garrick and others  I have sailed a long and painful voyage round the world of the English langunge and does he now send out two cockboats to tow me into harbour  He had said in the last number of the Rambler  that having laboured to maintain the dignity of virtue I will not now degrade it by the meanness of dedication  Such a man when  he had finished his "Dictionary not" as he says himself  in the soft obscurities of retirement or under the shelter of academic bowers but amidst inconvenience and distraction in sickness and in sorrow and without the patronage of the great  was not likely to be caught by the lure thrown out by Lord Chesterfield He had in vain sought the patronage of that nobleman and his pride exasperated by disappointment drew from him the following letter dated in the month of February  To the Right Honourable the Earl of CHESTERFIELD  MY LORD  I have been lately informed by the proprietors of the World that two papers in which my Dictionary is recommended to the publick were written by your Lordship To be so distinguished is an honour which being very little accustomed to favours from the great I know not well how to receive or in what terms to acknowledge  When upon some slight encouragement I first visited your Lordship I was overpowered like the rest of mankind by the enchantment  of your address and could not forbear to wish that I might boast myself  le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre  that I might obtain that regard for which I saw the world contending But I found my attendance so little encouraged that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue it When I had once addressed your Lordship in public I had exhausted all the art of pleasing which a retired and uncourtly scholar can possess I had done all that I could and no man is well pleased to have his all neglected be it ever so little  Seven years my Lord have now passed since I waited in your outward room or was repulsed from your door during which time I have been pushing on my work through difficulties of which it is useless to complain and have brought it at last to the verge of publication without one act of assistance one word of encouragement or one smile of favour Such treatment I did not expect for I never had a patron before  The Shepherd in Virgil grew acquainted with Love and found him a native of the rocks  Is not a patron my Lord one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water and when has he reached ground encumbers him with help The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours had it been early had been kind but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it till I am solitary and cannot impart it till I am known and do not want it I hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess obligations where no benefit has been received or to be unwilling that the publick should consider me as owing that to a patron which Providence has enabled me to do for myself  Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favourer of learning I shall not be disappointed though I should conclude it if less be possible with less for I have been long wakened from that dream of hope in which I once boasted myself with fo much exultation  My Lord  Your Lordship's most humble and most obedient servant SAMUEL JOHNSON  It is said upon good authority that Johnson once received from Lord Chesterfield the sum of ten pounds It were to be wished that the secret had never transpired It was mean to receive it and meaner to give it It may be imagined that for Johnson's ferocity as it has been called there was some foundation in his finances and as his Dictionary was brought to a conclusion that money was now to flow in upon him The reverse was the case For his subsistence during the progress of the work he had received at different times the amount of his contract and when his receipts were produced to him at a taverndinner given by the booksellers it appeared that he had been paid a hundred pounds and upwards more than his due The author of a book called  Lexiphanes  written by a Mr Campbell a Scotchman and purser of a man of war endeavoured to blast his laurels but in vain The world applauded and Johnson never replied "Abuse" he said  is often of service there is nothing so dangerous to an author as silence his name like a shuttlecock must be beat backward and forward or it falls to the ground  Lexiphanes professed  to be an imitation of the pleasant manner of Lucian but humour was not the talent of the writer of Lexiphanes As Dryden says "He had too much horseplay in his raillery"  It was in the summer that the present writer became acquainted with Dr Johnson The cause of his first visit is related by Mrs Piozzi nearly in the following manner  Mr Murphy being engaged in a periodical paper the Gray'sInn Journal was at a friend's house in the country and not being disposed to lose pleasure for business wished to content his bookseller by some unstudied essay He therefore took up a French  Journal Lit√©raire  and translating something he liked sent it away to town Time however discovered that he translated from the French a Rambler which had been taken from the English without acknowledgement Upon this discovery Mr Murphy thought it right to make his excuses to Dr Johnson He went next day and found him covered with soot like a chimneysweeper in a little room as if he had been acting Lungs in the Alchymist  making aether  This being told by Mr Murphy in company 'Come come'  said Dr Johnson 'the story is black enough but it was a happy day that brought you first to my house'  After this first visit the author of this narrative by degrees grew intimate with Dr Johnson The first striking sentence that he heard from him was in a few days after the publication of Lord Bolingbroke's posthumous works Mr Garrick asked him "If he had seen them"  Yes I have seen them  What do you think of them  "Think of them" He made a long pause and then replied  Think of them A scoundrel and a coward A scoundrel who spent his life in charging a gun against Christianity and a coward who was afraid of hearing the report of his own gun but left half a crown to a hungry Scotchman to draw the trigger after his death  His mind at this time strained and overlaboured by constant exertion called for an interval of repose and indolence But indolence was the time of danger it was then that his spirits not employed abroad turned with inward hostility against himself His reflections on his own life and conduct were always severe and wishing to be immaculate  he destroyed his own peace by unnecessary scruples He tells us that when he surveyed his past life he discovered nothing but a barren waste of time with some disorders of body and disturbances of mind very near to madness His life he says from his earliest years was wasted in a morning bed and his reigning sin was a general sluggishness to which he was always inclined and in part of his life almost compelled by morbid melancholy and weariness of mind This was his constitutional malady derived perhaps from his father who was at times overcast with a gloom that bordered on insanity When to this it is added that Johnson about the age of twenty drew up a description of his infirmities for Dr Swinfen at that time an eminent physician in Staffordshire and received an answer to his letter importing that the symptoms indicated a future privation of reason who can wonder that he was troubled with melancholy and dejection of spirit An apprehension of the worst calamity that can befal human nature hung over him all the rest of his life like the sword of the tyrant suspended over his guest In his sixtieth year he had a mind to write the history of his melancholy but he desisted not knowing  whether it would not too much disturb him In a Latin poem however to which he has prefixed as a title  he has left a picture of himself drawn with as much truth and as firm a hand as can be seen in the portraits of Hogarth or Sir Joshua Reynolds The learned reader will find the original poem in this volume p and it is hoped that a translation or rather imitation of so curious a piece will not be improper in this place  KNOW YOURSELF  AFTER REVISING AND ENLARGING THE ENGLISH LEXICON OR DICTIONARY  When Scaliger whole years of labour past  Beheld his Lexicon complete at last  And weary of his task with wond'ring eyes  Saw from words pil'd on words a fabric rise  He curs'd the industry inertly strong  In creeping toil that could persist so long  And if enrag'd he cried Heav'n meant to shed  Its keenest vengeance on the guilty head  The drudgery of words the damn'd would know  Doom'd to write Lexicons in endless woe  See Scaliger's Epigram on this subject communicated with out doubt by Dr Johnson Gent Mag p    Yes you had cause great Genius to repent  "You lost good days that might be better spent"  You well might grudge the hours of ling'ring pain  And view your learned labours with disdain  To you were giv'n the large expanded mind  The flame of genius and the taste refin'd  'Twas yours on eagle wings aloft to soar  And amidst rolling worlds the Great First Cause explore  To fix the aeras of recorded time  And live in ev'ry age and ev'ry clime  Record the Chiefs who propt their Country's cause  Who founded Empires and establish'd Laws  To learn whate'er the Sage with virtue fraught  Whate'er the Muse of moral wisdom taught  These were your quarry these to you were known  And the world's ample volume was your own  Yet warn'd by me ye pigmy Wits beware  Nor with immortal Scaliger compare  For me though his example strike my view  Oh not for me his footsteps to pursue  Whether first Nature unpropitious cold  This clay compounded in a ruder mould  Or the slow current loit'ring at my heart  No gleam of wit or fancy can impart  Whate'er the cause from me no numbers flow  No visions warm me and no raptures glow  A mind like Scaliger's superior still  No grief could conquer no misfortune chill  Though for the maze of words his native skies  He seem'd to quit 'twas but again to rise  To mount once more to the bright source of day  And view the wonders of th'aetherial way  The love of Fame his gen'rous bosom fir'd  Each Science hail'd him and each Muse inspir'd  For him the Sons of Learning trimm'd the bays  And Nations grew harmonious in his praise  My talk perform'd and all my labours o'er  For me what lot has Fortune now in store  The listless will succeeds that worst disease  The rack of indolence the sluggish ease  Care grows on care and o'er my aching brain  Black Melancholy pours her morbid train  No kind relief no lenitive at hand  I seek at midnight clubs the social Band  But midnight clubs where wit with noise conspires  Where Comus revels and where wine inspires  Delight no more I seek my lonely bed  And call on Sleep to sooth my languid head  But Sleep from these sad lids flies far away  I mourn all night and dread the coming day  Exhausted tir'd I throw my eyes around  To find some vacant spot on classic ground  And soon vain hope I form a grand design  Languor succeeds and all my pow'rs decline  If Science open not her richest vein  Without materials all our toil is vain  A form to rugged stone when Phidias gives  Beneath his touch a new creation lives  Remove his marble and his genius dies  With Nature then no breathing statue vies  Whate'er I plan I feel my pow'rs confin'd  By Fortune's frown and penury of mind  I boast no knowledge glean'd with toil and strife  That bright reward of a wellacted life  I view myself while Reason's feeble light  Shoots a pale glimmer through the gloom of night  While passions error phantoms of the brain  And vain opinions fill the dark domain  A dreary void where fears with grief combin'd  Waste all within and desolate the mind  What then remains Must I in slow decline  To mute inglorious ease old age resign  Or bold ambition kindling in my breast  Attempt some arduous task Or were it best  Brooding o'er Lexicons to pas the day  And in that labour drudge my life away  Such is the picture for which Dr Johnson sat to himself He gives the prominent features of his character his lassitude his morbid  bid melancholy his love of fame his dejection his tavernparties and his wandering reveries  Vacuae mala somnia mentis  about which so much has been written all are painted in miniature but in vivid colours by his own hand His idea of writing more Dictionaries was not merely said in verse Mr Hamilton who was at that time an eminent printer and well acquainted with Dr Johnson remembers that he engaged in a Commercial Dictionary and as appears by the receipt in his possession was paid his price for several sheets but he soon relinquished the undertaking It is probable that he found himself not suffiently versed in that branch of knowledge  He was again reduced to the expedient of short compositions for the supply of the day The writer of this narrative has now before him a letter in Dr Johnson's handwriting which shews the distress and melancholy situation of the man who had written the Rambler and finished the great work of his Dictionary The letter is directed to Mr Richardson the author of Clarissa and is as follows  SIR  I am obliged to entreat your assistance I am now under an arrest for five pounds eighteen shillings Mr Strahan from whom I should have received the necessary help in this case is not at home and I am afraid of not finding Mr Millar If you will be so good as to send me this sum I will very gratefully repay you and add it to all former obligations I am Sir  Your most obedient and most humble servant SAMUEL JOHNSON  Goughsquare  March  In the margin of this letter there is a memorandum in these words  March Sent six guineas Witness Wm Richardson  For the honour of an admired writer it is to be regretted that we do not find a more liberal entry To his friend in distress he sent eight shillings more than was wanted Had an incident of this kind occurred in one of his Romances Richardson would have known how to grace his hero but in fictitious scenes generosity costs the writer nothing  About this time Johnson contributed several papers to a periodical Miscellany called The VISITOR from motives which are highly honourable to him a compassionate regard for the late Mr Christopher Smart The criticism on Pope's Epitaphs appeared in that work In a short time after he became a reviewer in the Literary Magazine under the auspices of the late Mr Newbery a man of a projecting head good taste and great industry This employment engrossed but little of Johnson's time He resigned himself to indolence took no exercise rose about two and then received the visits of his friends Authors long since forgotten waited on him as their oracle and he gave responses in the chair of criticism He listened to the complaints the schemes and the hopes and fears of a crowd of inferior writers "who" he said in the words of Roger Ascham  lived  men know not how and died obscure men marked not when  He believed that he could give a better history of Grubstreet than any man living His house was filled with a succession of visitors till four or five in the evening During the whole time he presided at his teatable  Tea was his favorite beverage and when the late Jonas Hanway pronounced his anathema against the use of tea Johnson rose in defence of his habitual practice declaring himself  in that article a hardened sinner who had for years diluted his meals with the infusion of that fascinating plant whose teakettel had no time to cool who with tea solaced the midnight hour and with tea welcomed the morning  The proposal for a new edition of Shakspeare which had formerly miscarried was resumed in the year The booksellers readily agreed to his terms and subscriptiontickets were issued out For undertaking this work money he confessed was the inciting motive His friends exerted themselves to promote his interest and in the mean time he engaged in a new periodical production called THE IDLER The first number appeared on Saturday April and the last April The profits of this work and the subscriptions for the new edition of Shakspeare were the means by which he supported himself for four or five  years In was published Rasselas Prince of Abyssinia His translation of Lobo's Voyage to Abyssinia seems to have pointed out that country for the scene of action and  Rassila Christos  the General of  Sultan Segued  mentioned in that work most probably suggested the name of the prince The author wanted to set out on a journey to Lichfield in order to pay the last offices of filial piety to his mother who at the age of ninety was then near her dissolution but money was necessary Mr Johnston a bookseller who has long since left off business gave one hundred pounds for the copy With this supply Johnson set out for Lichfield but did not arrive in time to close the eyes of a parent whom he loved He attended the funeral which as appears among his memorandums was on the d of January  Johnson now found it necessary to retrench Lis expences He gave up his house in Goughsquare Mrs Williams went into lodgings He retired to Gray'sInn and soon removed to chambers in the Inner Templelane where he lived in poverty total idleness and the pride of  literature  Magni stat nominis umbrd  Mr Fitzherbert the father of Lord St Helen's the present minister at Madrid a man distinguished through life for his benevolence and other amiable qualities used to say that he paid a morning visit to Johnson intending from his chambers to send a letter into the city but to his great surprize he found an author by profession without pen ink or paper The present Bishop of Salisbury was also among those who endeavoured by constant attention to sooth the cares of a mind which he knew to be afflicted with gloomy apprehensions At one of the parties made at his house Boscovich the Jesuit who had then lately introduced the Newtonian philosophy at Rome and after publishing an elegant Latin poem on the subject was made a Fellow of the Royal Society was one of the company invited to meet Dr Johnson The conversation at first was mostly in French Johnson though thoroughly versed in that language and a professed admirer of Boileau and La Bruyere did not understand its pronunciation nor could he speak it himself with propriety For the rest of the evening the talk was in Latin Boscovich had a  ready current flow of that flimsy phraseology with which a priest may travel through Italy Spain and Germany Johnson scorned what he called colloquial barbarisms It was his pride to speak his best He went on after a little practice with as much facility as if it was his native tongue One sentence this writer well remembers Observing that Fontinelle at first opposed the Newtonian philosophy and embraced it afterwards his words were  Fontinellus ni fallor in extrem√¢ senectute fuit transfuga ad castra Newtoniana  We have now traveled through that part of Dr Johnson's life which was a perpetual struggle with difficulties Halcyon days are now to open upon him In the month of May his Majesty to reward literary merit signified his pleasure to grant to Johnson a pension of three hundred pounds a year The Earl of Bute was minister Lord Loughborongh who perhaps was originally a mover in the business had authority to mention it He was well acquainted with Johnson but having heard much of his independent spirit and of the downfall of Osborne the bookseller he did  not know but his benevolence might be rewarded with a folio on his head He desired the author of these memoirs to undertake the task This writer thought the opportunity of doing so much good the most happy incident in his life He went without delay to the chambers in the Inner Templelane which in fact were the abode of wretchedness By slow and studied approaches the message was disclosed Johnson made a long pause he asked if it was seriously intended He fell into a profound meditation and his own definition of a pensioner occurred to him He was told  That he at least did not come within the definition  He desired to meet next day and dine at the Mitre Tavern At that meeting he gave up all his scruples On the following day Lord Loughborough conducted him to the Earl of Bute The conversation that passed was in the evening related to this writer by Dr Johnson He expressed his sense of his Majesty's bounty and thought himself the more highly honoured as the favour was not bestowed on him for having dipped his pen in faction "No Sir" said Lord Bute  it is not offered  to you for having dipped your pen in faction nor with a design that you ever should  Sir John Hawkins will have it that after this interview Johnson was often pressed to wait on Lord Bute but with a sullen spirit refused to comply However that be Johnson was never heard to utter a disrespectful word of that nobleman The writer of this essay remembers a circumstance which may throw some light on this subject The late Dr Rose of Chiswick whom Johnson loved and respected contended for the preeminence of the Scotch writers and Ferguson's book on Civil Society then on the eve of publication he said would give the laurel to North Britain  Alas what can he do upon that subject  said Johnson  Aristotle Polybius Grotius Puffendorf and Burlemaqui have reaped in that field before him  "He will treat it" said Dr Rose "in a new manner"  A new manner Buckinger had no hands and he wrote his name with his toes at Charingcross for half a crown apiece that was a new manner of writing  Dr Rose replied  If that will not satisfy you I will name a writer whom you must allow to be  the best in the kingdom  "Who is that"  The Earl of Bute when he wrote an order for your pension  "There Sir" said Johnson  you have me in the toil to Lord Bute I must allow whatever praise you may claim for him  Ingratitude was no part of Johnson's character  Being now in the possession of a regular income Johnson left his chambers in the Temple and once more became master of a house in Johnson'scourt Fleetstreet Dr Levet his friend and physician in ordinary paid his daily visits with assiduity made tea all the morning talked what he had to say and did not expect an answer Mrs Williams had her apartment in the house and entertained her benefactor with more enlarged conversation Chemistry was part of Johnson's amusement For this love of experimental philosophy Sir John Hawkins thinks an apology necessary He tells us with great gravity that curiosity was the only object in view not an intention to grow suddenly rich by the philosopher's stone or the transmutation of metals To enlarge his circle Johnson once more had recourse  course to a literary club This was at the Turk's Head in Gerrardstreet Soho on every Tuesday evening through the year The members were besides himself the right honourable Edmund Burke Sir Joshua Reynolds Dr Nugent Dr Goldsmith the late Mr Topham Beauclerk Mr Langton Mr Chamier Sir John Hawkins and some others Johnson's affection for Sir Joshua was founded on a long acquaintance and a thorough knowledge of the virtues and amiable qualities of that excellent artist He delighted in the conversation of Mr Burke He met him for the first time at Mr Garrick's several years ago On the next day he said  I suppose Murphy you are proud of your countryman CUM TALIS SIT UTINAM NOSTER ESSET  From that time his constant observation was  That a man of sense could not meet Mr Burke by accident under a gateway to avoid a shower without being convinced that he was the first man in England  Johnson felt not only kindness but zeal and ardour for his friends He did every thing in his power to advance the reputation of Dr Goldsmith He loved him though he  knew his failings and particularly the leaven of envy which corroded the mind of that elegant writer and made him impatient without disguise of the praises bestowed on any person whatever Of this infirmity which marked Goldsmith's character Johnson gave a remarkable instance It happened that he went with Sir Joshua Reynolds and Goldsmith to see the Fantoccini which were exhibited some years ago in or near the Haymarket They admired the curious mechanism by which the puppets were made to walk the stage draw a chair to the table sit down write a letter and perform a variety of other actions with such dexterity that  though Nature's journeymen made the men they imitated humanity  to the astonishment of the spectator The entertainment being over the three friends retired to a tavern Johnson and Sir Joshua talked with pleasure of what they had seen and says Johnson in a tone of admiration  How the little fellow brandished his spontoon  "There is nothing in it" replied Goldsmith starting up with impatience  give me a spontoon I can do it as well myself  Enjoying his amusements at his weekly club and happy in a state of independence Johnson gained in the year another resource which contributed more than any thing else to exempt him from the solicitudes of life He was introduced to the late Mr Thrale and his family Mrs Piozzi has related the fact and it is therefore needless to repeat it in this place The author of this narrative looks back to the share he had in that business with selfcongratulation since he knows the tenderness which from that time soothed Johnson's cares at Streatham and prolonged a valuable life The subscribers to Shakspeare began to despair of ever seeing the promised edition To acquit himself of this obligation he went to work unwillingly but proceeded with vigour In the month or October Shakspeare was published and in a short time after the University of Dublin sent over a diploma in honourable terms creating him a Doctor of Laws Oxford in eight or ten years afterwards followed the example and till then Johnson never assumed the title of Doctor In his constitution seemed to be in a rapid decline  and that morbid melancholy which often clouded his understanding came upon him with a deeper gloom than ever Mr and Mrs Thrale paid him a visit in this situation and found him on his knees with Dr Delap the rector of Lewes in Sussex beseeching God to continue to him the use of his understanding Mr Thrale took him to his house at Streatham and Johnson from that time became a constant resident in the family He went occasionally to the club in Gerardstreet but his head quarters were fixed at Streatham An apartment was fitted up for him and the library was greatly enlarged Parties were constantly invited from town and Johnson was every day at an elegant table with select and polished company Whatever could be devised by Mr and Mrs Thrale to promote the happiness and establish the health of their guest was studiously performed from that time to the end of Mr Thrale's life Johnson accompanied the family in all their summer excursions to Brighthelmstone to Wales and to Paris It is but justice to Mr Thrale to say that a more ingenuous frame of mind no man possessed His education at Oxford gave him the  habits of a gentleman his amiable temper recommended his conversation and the goodness of his heart made him a sincere friend That he was the patron of Johnson is an honour to his memory  In petty disputes with contemporary writers or the wits of the age Johnson was seldom entangled A single incident of that kind may not be unworthy of notice since it happened with a man of great celebrity in his time A number of friends dined with Garrick on a Christmas day Foote was then in Ireland It was said at table that the modern Aristophanes so Foote was called had been horsewhipped by a Dublin apothecary for mimicking him on the stage "I wonder" said Garrick  that any man should shew so much resentment to Foote he has a patent for such liberties nobody ever thought it  worth his while  to quarrel with him in London  "I am glad" said Johnson  to find that the  man is rising in the world  The expression was afterwards reported to Foote who in return gave out that he would produce  the  Caliban of literature  on the stage Being informed of this design Johnson sent word to Foote  That the theatre being intended for the reformation of vice he would step from the boxes on the stage and correct him before the audience  Foote knew the intrepidity of his antagonist and abandoned the design No illwill ensued Johnson used to say  That for broadfaced mirth Foote had not his equal  Dr Johnson's fame excited the curiosity of the King His Majesty expressed a desire to see a man of whom extraordinary things were said Accordingly the librarian at Buckinghamhouse invited Johnson to see that elegant collection of books at the same time giving a hint of what was intended His Majesty entered the room and among other things asked the author  If he meant to give the world any more of his compositions  Johnson answered  That he thought he had written enough  And I should think so too  replied his Majesty  if you had not written so well  Though Johnson thought he had written enough his genius even in spite of bodily sluggishness could not lie still In we find him entering the lists as a political writer The flame of discord that blazed throughout the nation on the expulsion of Mr Wilkes and the final determination of the House of Commons that Mr Luttrell was duly elected by votes against spread a general spirit of discontent To allay the tumult Dr Johnson published  The False Alarm  Mrs Piozzi informs us  That this pamphlet was written at her house between eight o'clock on Wednesday night and twelve on Thursday night  This celerity has appeared wonderful to many and some have doubted the truth It may however be placed within the bounds of probability Johnson has observed that there are different methods of composition Virgil was used to pour out a great number of verses in the morning and pass the day in retrenching the exuberances and correcting inaccuracies and it was Pope's custom to write his first thoughts in his first words and gradually to amplify decorate rectify and  refine them Others employ at once memory and invention and with little intermediate use of the pen form and polish large masses by continued meditation and write their productions only when in their opinion they have completed them This last was Johnson's method He never took his pen in hand till he had well weighed his subject and grasped in his mind the sentiments the train of argument and the arrangement of the whole As he often thought aloud he had perhaps talked it over to himself This may account for that rapidity with which in general he dispatched his sheets to the press without being at the trouble of a fair copy Whatever may be the logic or eloquence of  The False Alarm  the House of Commons have since erased the resolution from the Journals But whether they have not left materials for a future controversy may be made a question  In he published another tract on the subject of FALKLAND ISLANDS The design was to shew the impropriety of going to war with Spain for an island thrown aside from human use stormy in winter and barren in  summer For this work it is apparent that materials were furnished by direction of the minister  At the approach of the general election in he wrote a short discourse called THE PATRIOT not with any visible application to Mr Wilkes but to teach the people to reject the leaders of opposition who called themselves patriots In he undertook a pamphlet of more importance namely  Taxation no Tyranny  in answer to the Resolutions and Address of the American Congress The scope of the argument was that distant colonies which had in their assemblies a legislature of their own were notwithstanding liable to be taxed in a British Parliament where they had neither peers in one house nor representatives in the other He was of opinion that this country was strong enough to enforce obedience "When an Englishman" he says  is told that the Americans shoot up like the hydra he naturally considers how the hydra was destroyed  The event has shewn how much he and the minister of that day were mistaken  The Account of the Tour to the Western Islands of Scotland which was undertaken in the autumn of in company with Mr Boswell was not published till some time in the year This book has been variously received by some extolled for the elegance of the narrative and the depth of observation on life and manners by others as much condemned as a work of avowed hostility to the Scotch nation The praise was beyond all question fairly deserved and the censure on due examination will appear hasty and illfounded That Johnson entertained some prejudices against the Scotch must not be dissembled It is true as Mr Boswell says  that he thought their success in England exceeded their proportion of real merit and he could not but see in them that nationality which no liberalminded Scotsman will deny  The author of these memoirs well remembers that Johnson one day asked him  Have you observed the difference between your own country impudence and Scottish impudence  The answer being in the negative  Then I will tell you  said Johnson  The impudence of  an Irishman is the impudence of a fly that buzzes about you and you put it away but it returns again and flutters and teazes you The impudence of a Scotsman is the impudence of a leech that fixes and sucks your blood  Upon another occasion this writer went with him into the shop of Davies the bookseller in Russelstreet Coventgarden Davies came running to him almost out of breath with joy  The Scots gentleman is come Sir his principal wish is to see you he is now in the backparlour  Well well I'll see the gentleman  said Johnson He walked towards the room Mr Boswell was the person This writer followed with no small curiosity "I find" said Mr Boswell  that I am come to London at a bad time when great popular prejudice has gone forth against us North Britons but when I am talking to you I am talking to a large and liberal mind and you know that I cannot  help coming from Scotland  "Sir" said Johnson "no more can the rest of your countrymen"  He had other reasons that helped to alienate him from the natives of Scotland Being a cordial wellwisher to the constitution in Church and State he did not think that Calvin and John Knox were proper founders of a national religion He made however a wide distinction between the Dissenters of Scotland and the Separatists of England To the former he imputed no disaffection no want of loyalty Their soldiers and their officers had shed their blood with zeal and courage in the service of Great Britain and the people he used to say were content with their own established modes of worship without wishing in the present age to give any disturbance to the Church of England This he was at all times ready to admit and therefore declared that whenever he found a Scotchman to whom an Englishman was as a Scotchman that Scotchman should be as an Englishman to him In this surely there was no rancour no malevolence The Dissenters on this side the Tweed appeared to him in a different light Their religion he frequently said was too worldly too political too restless and ambitious The doctrine of  cashiering  kings and erecting on the ruins of the constitution a new form of government which lately issued from their pulpits he always thought was under a calm disguise the principle that lay lurking in their hearts He knew that a wild democracy had overturned King Lords and Commons and that a set of Republican Fanatics who would not bow at the name of JESUS had taken possession of all the livings and all the parishes in the kingdom That those scenes of horror might never be renewed was the ardent wish of Dr Johnson and though he apprehended no danger from Scotland it is probable that his dislike of Calvinism mingled sometimes with his reflections on the natives of that country The association of ideas could net be easily broken but it is well known that he loved and reflected many gentlemen from that part of the island Dr Robertson's History of Scotland and Dr Beattie's Essays were subjects of his constant praise M Boswell Dr Rose of Chiswick Andrew Millar Mr Hamilton the printer and the late Mr Strahan were among his most intimate friends Many others might be added to the list He scorned to enter Scotland as a  spy though Hawkins his biographer and the professing defender of his fame allowed himself leave to represent him in that ignoble character He went into Scotland to survey men and manners Antiquities fossils and minerals were not within his province He did not visit that country to settle the station of Roman camps or the spot where Galgacus fought the last battle for public liberty The people their customs and the progress of literature were his objects The civilities which he received in the course of his tour have been repaid with grateful acknowledgement and generally with great elegance of expression His crime is that he found the country bare of trees and he has stated the fact This Mr Boswell in his Tour to the Hebrides has told us was resented by his countrymen with anger inflamed to rancour but he admits that there are few trees on the east side of Scotland Mr Pennant in his Tour says that in some parts of the eastern side of the country he saw several large plantations of pine planted by gentlemen near their seats and in this respect such a laudable spirit prevails that  in another half century  it never  shall be said  To spy the nakedness of the land are you come  Johnson could not wait for that half century and therefore mentioned things as he found them If in any thing he has been mistaken he has made a fair apology in the last paragraph of his book avowing with candour  That he may have been surprized by modes of life and appearances of nature that are familiar to men of wider survey and more varied conversation Novelty and ignorance must always be reciprocal and he is conscious that his thoughts on national manners are the thoughts of one who has seen but little  The Poems of Ossian made a part of Johnson's enquiry during his residence in Scotland and the Hebrides On his return to England November a storm seemed to be gathering over his head but the cloud never burst and the thunder never fell Ossian it is well known was presented to the publick as a translation from the  Earse  but that this was a fraud Johnson declared without hesitation "The  Earse"  he says  was always oral only and never a written language The  Welch and the Irish were more cultivated In  Earse  there was not in the world a single manuscript a hundred years old Martin who in the last century published an Account of the Western Islands mentions  Irish  but never  Earse  manuscripts to be found in the islands in his time The bards could not read if they could they might probably have written But the bard was a barbarian among barbarians and knowing nothing himself lived with others that knew no more If there is a manuscript from which the translation was made in what age was it written and where is it If it was collected from oral recitation it could only be in detached parts and scattered fragments the whole is too long to be remembered  Who put it together in its present form For these and such like reasons Johnson calls the whole an imposture He adds  The editor or author never could shew the original nor can it be shewn by any other To revenge reasonable incredulity by refusing evidence is a degree of insolence with which the world is not yet acquainted  and stubborn audacity is the last refuge of guilt  This reasoning carries with it great weight It roused the resentment of Mr Macpherson He sent a threatening letter to the author and Johnson answered him in the rough phrase of stern defiance The two heroes frowned at a distance but never came to action  In the year the misfortunes of Dr Dodd excited his compassion He wrote a speech for that unhappy man when called up to receive judgement of death besides two petitions one to the King and another to the Queen and a sermon to be preached by Dodd to the convicts in Newgate It may appear trifling to add that about the same time he wrote a prologue to the comedy of A Word to the Wise written by  Hugh Kelly  The play some years before had been damned by a party on the first night It was revived for the benefit of the author's widow Mrs Piozzi relates that when Johnson was rallied for these exertions so close to one another his answer was  When they come to me with a dying  Parson and a dead Staymaker what can a man do  We come now to the last of his literary labours At the request of the Booksellers he undertook the Lives of the Poets The first publication was in and the whole was compleated in In a memorandum of that year he says some time in March he finished the Lives of the Poets which he wrote in his usual way dilatorily and hastily unwilling to work yet working with vigour and haste In another place he hopes they are written in such a manner as may tend to the promotion of piety That the history of so many men who in their different degrees made themselves conspicuous in their time was not written recently after their deaths seems to be an omission that does no honour to the Republic of Letters Their contemporaries in general looked on with calm indifference and suffered Wit and Genius to vanish out of the world in total silence unregarded and unlamented Was there no friend to pay the tribute of a tear No just observer of life to record the virtues of the deceased Was even Envy silent It seemed to have been agreed that if an author's works survived the history of the man was to give no  moral lesson to afterages If tradition told us that BEN JONSON went to the Devil Tavern that SHAKSPEARE stole deer and held the stirrup at playhouse doors that DRYDEN frequented Button's Coffeehouse curiosity was lulled asleep and Biography forgot the best part of her function which is to instruct mankind by examples taken from the school of life This task remained for Dr Johnson when years had rolled away when the channels of information were for the most part choaked up and little remained besides doutful anecdote uncertain tradition and vague report  "Nunc fitus informis premit et deserta Vetustas"  The value of Biography has been better understood in other ages and in other countries Tacitus informs us that to record the lives and characters of illustrious men was the practice of the Roman authors in the early periods of the Republic In France the example has been followed  Fontinells D' Alembert  and  Monsieur Thomas  have left models in this kind of composition They have  embalmed  the dead But it is true that they had incitements and advantages  even at a distant day which could not by any diligence be obtained by Dr Johnson The wits of France had ample materials They lived in a nation of critics who had at heart the honour done to their country by their Poets their Heroes and their Philosophers They had besides an  Academy of Belles Lettres  where Genius was cultivated refined and encouraged They had the tracts the essays and dissertations which remain in the memories of the Academy and they had the speeches of the several members delivered at their first admission to a seat in that learned Assembly In those speeches the new Academician did ample justice to the memory of his predecessor and though his harangue was decorated with the colours of eloquence and was for that reason called panegyric yet being pronounced before qualified judges who knew the talents the conduct and morals of the deceased the speaker could not with propriety wander into the regions of fiction The truth was known before it was adorned The Academy saw the marble before the artist polished it But this country has had no Academy of Literature The public mind for centuries  has been engrossed by party and faction  by the madness of many for the gain of a few  by civil wars religious dissentions trade and commerce and the arts of accumulating wealth Amidst such attentions who can wonder that cold praise has been often the only reward of merit In this country Doctor Nathaniel Hodges who like the good bishop of Marseilles  drew purer breath  amidst the contagion of the plague in London and during the whole time continued in the city administering medical assistence was suffered as Johnson used to relate with tears in his eyes to die for debt in a gaol In this country the man who brought the New River to London was ruined by that noble project and in this country Otway died for want on Tower Hill Butler the great author of Hudibras whose name can only die with the English language was left to languish in poverty the particulars of his life almost unknown and scarcs a vestige of him left except his immortal poem Had there been an Academy of Literature the lives at least of those celebrated persons would have been written for the benefit of posterity Swift it seems had the idea of such an institution and proposed  it to Lord Oxford but Whig and Tory were more important objects It is needless to dissemble that Dr Johnson in the Life of Roscommon talks of the inutility of such a project "In this country" he says  an Academy could be expected to do but little If an academician's place were profitable it would be given by interest if attendance were gratuitous it would be rarely paid and no man would endure the least disgust Unanimity is impossible and debate would separate the assembly  To this it may be sufficient to answer that the Royal Society has not been dissolved by sullen disgust and the modern Academy at Somersethouse has already performed much and promises more Unanimity is not necessary to such an assembly On the contrary by difference of opinion and collision of sentiment the cause of Literature would thrive and flourish The true principles of criticism the secret of fine writing the investigation of antiquities and other interesting subjects might occasion a clash of opinions but in that contention Truth would receive illustration and the essays of the several members would supply the Memoirs of the Academy  But says Dr Johnson  suppose the philological decree made and promulgated what would be its authority In absolute government there is sometimes a general reverence paid to all that has the sanction of power the countenance of greatness How little this is the state of our country needs not to be told The edicts of an English academy would probably be read by many only that they may be sure to disobey them The present manners of the nation would deride authority and therefore nothing is left but that every writer should criticize himself  This surely is not conclusive It is by the standard of the best writers that every man settles for himself his plan of legitimate composition and since the authority of superior genius is acknowledged that authority which the individual obtains would not be lessened by an association with others of distinguished ability It may therefore be inferred that an Academy of Literature would be an establishment highly useful and an honour to Literature In such an institution profitable places would not be wanted  Vatis avarus haud facile est animus  and the minister who shall find leisure from party  and faction to carry such a scheme into execution will in all probability be respected by posterity as the Maecenas of letters  We now take leave of Dr Johnson as an author Four volumes of his Lives of the Poets were published in and the work was completed in Should Biography fall again into disuse there will not always be a Johnson to look back through a century and give a body of critical and moral instruction In April he lost his friend Mr Thrale His own words in his diary will best tell that melancholy event  On Wednesday the th of April was buried my dear friend Mr Thrale who died on Wednesday the th and with him were buried many of my hopes and pleasures About five I think on Wednesday morning he expired I felt almost the last flutter of his pulse and looked for the last time upon the face that for fifteen years before had never been turned upon me but with respect and benignity Farewel may God that delighteth in mercy have  had  mercy on thee I had constantly prayed for him before his death The decease of him  from whose friendship I had obtained many opportunities of amusement and to whom I turned my thoughts as to a refuge from misfortune has left me heavy But my business is with myself  From the close of his last work the malady that persecuted him through life came upon him with alarming severity and his constitution declined apace In his old friend  Levet  expired without warning and without a groan Events like these reminded Johnson of his own mortality He continued his visits to Mrs Thrale at Streatham to the th day of October when having first composed a prayer for the happiness of a family with whom he had for many years enjoyed the pleasures and comforts of life he removed to his own house in town He says he was up early in the morning and read fortuitously in the Gospel  which was his parting use of the library  The merit of the family is manifested by the sense he had of it and we see his heart overflowing with gratitude He leaves the place with regret and  casts a lingering look behind  The few remaining occurrences may be soon dispatched In the month of June Johnson had a paralytic stroke which affected his speech only He wrote to Dr Taylor of Westminster and to his friend Mr Allen the printer who lived at the next door Dr Brocklesby arrived in a short time and by his care and that of Dr Heberden Johnson soon recovered During his illness the writer of this narrative visited him and found him reading Dr Watson's Chemistry Articulating with difficulty he said  From this book he who knows nothing may learn a great dealand he who knows will be pleased to find his knowledge recalled to his mind in a manner highly pleasing  In the month of August he set out for Lichfield on a visit to Mrs Lucy Porter the daughter of his wife by her first husband and in his way back paid his respects to Dr Adams at Oxford Mrs Williams died at his house in Boltcourt in the month of September during his absence This was another shock to a mind like his ever agitated by the thoughts of futurity The contemplation of his own approaching end was constantly before his eyes and the prospect of death he declared  was terrible For many years when he was not disposed to enter into the conversation going forward whoever sat near his chair might hear him repeating from Shakspeare  Ay but to die and go we know not where  To lie in cold obstruction and to rot  This sensible warm motion to become  A kneaded clod and the delighted spirit  To bathe in fiery floods  And from Milton  Who would lose  For fear of pain this intellectual being  By the death of Mrs Williams he was left in the a state of destitution with nobody but Frank his black servant to sooth his anxious moments In November he was swelled from head to foot with a drosy Dr Brocklesby with that benevolence with which he always assists his friends paid his visits with assiduity The medicines prescribed were so efficacious that in a few days Johnson while he was offering up his prayers was suddenly obliged to rise and in the course of the day discharged twenty pints of water  Johnson being eased of his dropsy began to entertain hopes that the vigour of his constitution was not entirely broken For the sake of conversing with his friends he established a convesation club to meet on every Wednesday evening and to serve a man whom he had known in Mr Thrale's houshold for many years the place was fixed at his house in Essex street near the Temple To answer the malignant remarks of Sir John Hawkins on this subject were a wretched waste of time Professing to be Johnson's friend that biographer has raised more objections to his character than all the enemies of that excellent man Sir John had a root of bitterness that  put rancours in the vessel of his peace  Fielding he says was the inventor of a cant phrase  Goodness of heart which means little more than the virtue of a horse or a dog  He should have known that kind affetions are the essence of virtue they are the will of God implanted in our nature to aid and strengthen moral obligation they incite to action a sense of benevolence is no less necessary than a sense of duty Good affections are an ornament not only to an author but to his writings He who shews  himself upon a cold scent for opportunities to bark and snarl throughout a volume of six hundred pages may if he will pretend to moralize but GOODNESS OF HEART or to use that politer phrase the  virtue of a horse or a dog  would redound more to his honour But Sir John is no more our business is with Johnson The members of his club were respectable for their rank their talents and their literature They attended with punctuality till about Midsummer when with some appearance of health Johnson went into Derbyshire and thence to Lichfield While he was in that part of the world his friends in town were labouring for his benefit The air of a more southern climate they thought might prolong a valuable life But a pension of ¬£ a year was a slender fund for a traveling valetudinarian and it was not then known that he had saved a moderate sum of money Mr Boswell and Sir Joshua Reynolds undertook to solicit the patronage of the Chancellor With Lord Thurlow while he was at the bar Johnson was well acquainted He was often heard to say  Thurlow is a man of such vigour of mind that I never knew I was to  meet him butI was going to say I was afraid but that would not be true for I never was afraid of any man but I never knew that I was to meet Thurlow but I knew I had something to encounter  The Chancellor undertook to recommend Johnson's case but without success To protract if possible the days of a man whom he respected he offered to advance the sum of five hundred pounds Being informed of this at Lichfield Johnson wrote the following letter  My Lord  After a long and not inattentive observation of mankind the generosity of your Lordship's offer raises in me not less wonder than gratitude Bounty so liberally bestowed I should gladly receive if my condition made it necessary for to such a mind who would not be proud to own his obligations But it has pleased God to restore me to so great a measure of health that if I should now appropriate so much of a fortune destined to do good I could not escape from myself the charge of advancing a false claim My journey to the continent though I once  thought it necessary was never much encouraged by my physicians and I was very desirous that your Lordship should be told it by Sir Joshua Reynolds as an event very uncertain for if I grew much better I should not be willing if much worse I should not be able to migrate Your Lordship was first solicited without my knowledge but when I was told that you were pleased to honour me with your patronage I did not expect to hear of a refusal yet as I have had no long time to brood hopes and have not rioted in imaginary opulence this cold reception has been scarce a disappointment and from your Lordship's kindness I have received a benefit which only men like you are able to bestow I shall now live  mihi carior  with a higher opinion of my own merit  I am my Lord your Lordship's most obliged most grateful and most humble servant SAMUEL JOHNSON  September  We have in this instance the exertion of two congenial minds one with a generous impulse relieving merit in distress and the other by gratitude and dignity of sentiment rising to an equal elevation  It seems however that greatness of mind is not confined to greatness of rank Dr Brocklesby was not content to assist with his medical art he resolved to  minister  to his patient's  mind  and  pluck from his memory the sorrow  which the late refusal from a high quarter might occasion To enable him to visit the south of France in pursuit of health he offered from his own funds an annuity of one hundred pounds payable quarterly This was a  sweet oblivious antidote  but it was not accepted for the reasons assigned to the Chancellor The proposal however will do honour to Dr Brocklesby as long as liberal sentiment shall be ranked among the social virtues  In the month of October we find Dr Johnson corresponding with Mr Nichols the intelligent compiler of the Gentleman's Magazine and in the langour of sickness still  desirous to contribute all in his power to the advancement of science and useful knowledge He says in a letter to that gentleman dated Lichfield October that he should be glad to give so skilful a lover of Antiquities any information He adds  At Ashburne where I had very little company I had the luck to borrow Mr Bowyer's Life a book so full of contemporary history that a literary man must find some of his old friends I thought that I could now and then have told you some hints worth your notice We perhaps may talk a life over I hope we shall be much together You must now be to me what you were before and what dear Mr Allen was besides He was taken unexpectedly away but I think he was a very good man I have made very little progress in recovery I am very weak and very sleepless but I live on and hope  In that languid condition he arrived on the th of November at his house in Boltcourt there to end his days He laboured with the dropsy and an asthma He was attended by Dr Heberden Dr Warren Dr Brocklesby  Dr Butter and Mr Cruikshank the eminent surgeon Eternity presented to his mind an aweful prospect and with as much virtue as perhaps ever is the lot of man he shuddered at the thought of his dissolution His friends awakened the comfortable reflection of a wellspent life and as his end drew near they had the satisfaction of seeing him composed and even chearful insomuch that he was able in the course of his restless nights to make translations of Greek epigrams from the Anthologia and to compose a Latin epitaph for his father his mother and his brother Nathaniel He meditated at the same time a Latin inscription to the memory of Garrick but his vigour was exhausted  His love of Literature was a passion that stuck to his last sand Seven days before his death he wrote the following letter to his friend Mr Nichols  SIR  The late learned Mr Swinton of Oxford having one day remarked that one man meaning I suppose no man but himself could assign all the parts of the Ancient Universal  History to their proper authors at the request of Sir Robert Chambers or myself gave the account which I now transmit to you in his own hand being willing that of so great a work the history should be known and that each writer should receive his due proportion of praise from posterity  I recommend to you to preserve this scrap of literary intelligence in Mr Swinton's own hand or to deposit in the Museum  It is there deposited J N  that the veracity of this account may never be doubted  I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON  Dec

Universal History The proposals were published October and the authors of the first seven volumes were  Vol Mr Sale translator of the Koran  II George Psalmanazar  III George Psalmanazar  III Archibald Bower Captain Shelvock Dr Campbell  IV The same as vol III  V Mr Bower  VI Mr Bower  Rev John Swinton  VII Mr Swinton  Mr Bower    On the morning of Dec Dr Johnson requested to see Mr Nichols A few days before he had borrowed some of the early volumes of the Magazine with a professed intention to point out the pieces which he had written in that collection The books lay on the table with many leaves doubled down and in particular those which contained his share in the Parliamentary Debates Such was the goodness of Johnson's heart that he then declared that  those debates were the only parts of his writings which gave him any compunction but that at the time he wrote them he had no conception that he was imposing upon the world though they were frequently written from very slender materials and often from none at all the mere coinage of his  own imagination  He added  that he never wrote any part of his work with equal velocity Three columns of the Magazine in an hour  he said  was no uncommon effort which was faster than most persons could have transcribed that quantity In one day in particular and that not a very long one he wrote twelve pages more in quantity than ever he wrote at any other time except in the Life of Savage of which forty eight pages in octavo were the production of one long day including a part of the night  In the course of the conversation he asked whether any of the family of Faden the printer were living Being told that the geographer near Charingcross was Faden's son he said after a short pause  I borrowed a guinea of his father near thirty years ago be so good as to take this and pay it for me  Wishing to discharge every duty and every obligation Johnson recollected another debt of ten pounds which he had borrowed from his friend Mr Hamilton the printer about twenty years before He sent the money to Mr Hamilton  at his house in Bedford Row with an apology for the length of time The Reverend Mr Strahan was the bearer of the message about four or five days before Johnson breathed his last  Mr Sastres whom Dr Johnson esteemed and mentioned in his will entered the room during his illness Dr Johnson as soon as he saw him stretched forth his hand and in a tone of lamentation called out JAM MORITURUS But the love of life was still an active principle Feeling himself swelled with the dropsy he conceived that by incisions in his legs the water might be discharged Mr Cruikshank apprehended that a mortification might be the consequence but to appease a distempered fancy he gently lanced the surface Johnson cried out  Deeper deeper I want length of life and you are afraid of giving me pain which I do not value  On the th of December the Reverend Mr Strahan drew his will by which after a few legacies the residue amounting to about fifteen hundred pounds was bequeathed to Frank the  Black servant formerly consigned to the testator by his friend Dr Bathurst  The history of a deathbed is painful Mr Strahan informs us that the strength of religion prevailed against the infirmity of nature and his foreboding dread of the Divine Justice subsided into a pious trust and humble hope of mercy at the Throne of Grace On Monday the th day of December the last of his existence on this side the grave the desire of life returned with all its former vehemence He still imagined that by puncturing his legs relief might be obtained At eight in the morning he tried the experiment but no water followed In an hour or two after he fell into a doze and about seven in the evening expired without a groan  On the th of the month his remains with due solemnities and a numerous attendance of his friends were buried in Westminster Abbey near the foot of Shakspeare's monument and close to the grave of the late Mr Garrick The funeral service was read by his friend Dr Taylor  A black marble over his grave has the following inscription  SAMUEL JOHNSON LL D  XIII die Decembris  Anno Domini  MDCCLXXXIV  Aetatis suae LXXV  If we now look back as from an eminence to view the scenes of life and the literary labours in which Dr Johnson was engaged we may be able to delineate the features of the man and to form an estimate of his genius  As a man Dr Johnson stands displayed in open day light Nothing remains undiscovered Whatever he said is known and without allowing him the usual privilege of hazarding sentiments and advancing positions for mere amusement or the pleasure of discussion Criticism has endeavoured to make him answerable for what perhaps he never seriously thought His diary which has been printed discovers still more We have before us the very heart or the man with all his inward consciousness And yet neither in the open paths of life nor in his secret recesses has any one vice been discovered We see him reviewing every year of his life and severely censuring himself for not keeping resolutions which morbid melancholy  and other bodily infirmities rendered impracticable We see him for every little defect imposing on himself voluntary penance going through the day with only one cup of tea without milk and to the last amidst paroxysms and remissions of illness forming plans of study and resolutions to amend his life  On the subject of voluntary penance see the Rambler N  o  CX  Many of his scruples may be called weaknesses but they are the weaknesses of a good a pious and most excellent man  His person it is well known was large and unwieldy His nerves were affected by that disorder for which at two years of age he was presented to the royal touch His head shook and involuntary motions made it uncertain that his legs and arms would even at a teatable remain in their proper place A person of Lord Chesterfield's delicacy might in his company be in a fever He would sometimes of his own accord do things inconsistent with the established modes of behaviour Sitting at table with the celebrated Mrs Cholmondeley who exerted herself to circulate the  subscription for Shakspeare he took hold of her hand in the middle of dinner and held it close to his eye wondering at the delicacy and the whiteness till with a smile she asked  Will he give it to me again when he has done with it  The exteriors of politeness did not belong to Johnson Even that civility which proceeds or ought to proceed from the mind was sometimes violated His morbid melancholy had an effect on his temper his passions were irritable and the pride of science as well as of a fierce independent spirit inflamed him on some occasions above all bounds of moderation Though not in the shade of academic bowers he led a scholastic life and the habit of pronouncing decisions to his friends and visitors gave him a dictatorial manner which was much enforced by a voice naturally loud and often overstretched Metaphysical discussion moral theory systems of religion and anecdotes of literature were his favourite topics General history had little of his regard Biography was his delight  The proper study of mankind is man  Sooner than hear of the Punic war he would be rude to the person that introduced the subject  Johnson was born a logician one of those to whom only books of logic are said to be of use In consequence of his skill in that art he loved argumentation No man thought more profoundly nor with such acute discernment A fallacy could not stand before him it was sure to be refuted by strength of reasoning and a precision both in idea and expression almost unequalled When he chose by apt illustration to place the argument of his adversary in a ludicrous light one was almost inclined to think  ridicule the test of truth  He was surprized to be told but it is certainly true that with great powers of mind wit and humour were his shining talents That he often argued for the sake of a triumph over his adversary cannot be dissembled Dr Rose of Chiswick has been heard to tell of a friend of his who thanked him for introducing him to Dr Johnson as he had been convinced in the course of a long dispute that an opinion which he had embraced as a settled truth was no better than a vulgar error This being reported to Johnson "Nay" said he  do not let him be thankful for he was right and I was wrong  Like his uncle Andrew in the ring at Smithfield Johnson  in a circle of disputants was determined  neither to be thrown nor conquered  Notwithstanding all his piety selfgovernment or the command of his passions in conversation does not seem to have been among his attainments Whenever he thought the contention was for superiority he has been known to break out with violence and even ferocity When the fray was over he generally softened into repentance and by conciliating measures took care that no animosity should be left rankling in the breast of his antagonist Of this defect he seems to have been conscious In a letter to Mrs Thrale he says  Poor Baretti do not quarrel with him to neglect him a little will be sufficient He means only to be frank and manly and independent and perhaps as you say a little wise To be srank he thinks is to be cynical and to be independent is to be rude Forgive him dearest lady the rather because of his misbehaviour I am afraid he learned part of me I hope to set him hereafter a better example  For his own intolerant and overbearing spirit he apologized by observing that it had done some good obscenity and impiety were repressed in his company  It was late in life before he had the habit of mixing otherwise than occasionally with polite company At Mr Thrale's he saw a constant succession of wellaccomplished visitors In that society he began to wear off the rugged points of his own character He saw the advantages of mutual civility and endeavoured to profit by the models before him He aimed at what has been called by Swift the  lesser morals  and by Cicero  minores virtutes  His endeavour though new and late gave pleasure to all his acquaintance Men were glad to see that he was willing to be communicative on equal terms and reciprocal complacence The time was then expected when he was to cease being what George Garrick brother to the celebrated actor called him the first time he heard him converse "A TREMENDOUS COMPANION" He certainly wished to be polite and even thought himself so but his civility still retained something uncouth and harsh His manners took a milder tone but the endeavour was too palpably seen He laboured even in trifles He was a giant gaining a  purchase  to lift a feather  It is observed by the younger Pliny that in the confines of virtue and great qualities there are generally vices of an opposite nature In Dr Johnson not one ingredient can take the name of vice From his attainments in literature grew the pride of knowledge and from his powers of reasoning the love of disputation and the vainglory of superior vigour His piety in some instances bordered on superstition He was willing to believe in preternatural agency and thought it not more strange that there should be evil spirits than evil men Even the question about second sight hold him in suspence "Second sight" Mr Pennant tells us  is a power of seeing images impressed on the organs of sight by the power of fancy or on the fancy by the disordered spirits operating on the mind It is the faculty of seeing spectres or visions which represent an event actually passing at a distance or likely to happen at a future day In a gentleman the last who was supposed to be possessed of this faculty had a boat at sea in a tempestuous night and being anxious for his freight suddenly started up and said his men would be drowned for he had seen them pass before  him with wet garments and dropping locks The event corresponded with his disordered fancy And thus  continues Mr Pennant  a distempered imagination clouded with anxiety may make an impression on the spirits as persons restless and troubled with indignation see various forms and figures while they lie awake in bed  This is what Dr Johnson was not willing to reject He wished for some positive proof of communications with another world His benevolence embraced the whole race of man and yet was tinctured with particular prejudices He was pleased with the minister in the Isle of Sky and loved him so much that he began to wish him not a Presbyterian To that body of Dissenters his zeal for the Established Church made him in some degree an adversary and his attachment to a mixed and limited Monarchy led him to declare open war against what he called a sullen Republican He would rather praise a man of Oxford than of Cambridge He disliked a Whig and loved a Tory These were the shades of his character which it has been the business of certain partywriters to represent in the darkest colours  Since virtue or moral goodness consists in a just conformity of our actions to the relations in which we stand to the Supreme Being and to our fellow creatures where shall we find a man who has been or endeavoured to be more diligent in the discharge of those essential duties His first prayer was composed in he continued those fervent ejaculations of piety to the end of his life In his meditations we see him scrutinizing himself with severity and aiming at perfection unattainable by man His duty to his neighbour consisted in universal benevolence and a constant aim at the production of happiness Who was more sincere and steady in his friendships It has been said that there was no real affection between him and Garrick On the part of the latter there might be some corrosions of jealousy The character of PROSPERO in the Rambler No was beyond all question occasioned by Garrick's ostentatious display of furniture and Dresden china It was surely fair to take from this incident a hint for a moral essay and though no more was intended Garrick we are told remembered it with uneasiness He was also hurt that his  Lichfield friend did not think so highly of his dramatic art as the rest of the world The fact was Johnson could not see the passions as they rose and chased one another in the varied features of that expressive face and by his own manner of reciting verses which was wonderfully impressive he plainly shewed that he thought there was too much of artificial tone and measured cadence in the declamation of the theatre The present writer well remembers being in conversation with Dr Johnson near the side of the scenes during the tragedy of King Lear when Garrick came off the stage he said  You two talk so loud you destroy all my feelings  "Prithee" replied Johnson  do not talk of feelings Punch has no feelings  This seems to have been his settled opinion admirable as Garrick's imitation of nature always was Johnson thought it no better than mere mimickry Yet it is certain that he esteemed and loved Garrick that he dwelt with pleasure on his praise and used to declare that he deserved his great success because on all applications for charity he gave more than was asked After Garrick's death he never talked  of him without a tear in his eyes He offered if Mrs Garrick would desire it of him to be the editor of his works and the historian of his life It has been mentioned that on his deathbed he thought of writing a Latin inscription to the memory of his friend Numbers are still living who know these facts and sti remember with gratitude the friendship which he shewed to them with unaltered affection for a number of years His humanity and generosity in proportion to his slender income were unbounded It has been truly said that the lame the blind and the sorrowful found in his house a sure retreat A strict adherence to truth he considered as a sacred obligation insomuch that in relating the most minute anecdote he would not allow himself the smallest addition to embellish his story The late Mr Tyers who knew Dr Johnson intimately observed  that he always talked as if he was talking upon oath  After a long acquaintance with this excellent man and an attentive retrospect to his whole conduct such is the light in which he appears to the writer of this essay The following lines of Horace may be deemed his picture in miniature  Iracundior est paulo minus aptus acutis  Naribus horum hominum rideri possit eo quod  Rusticius tonso toga defluit male laxus  In pede calceus haeret at est bonus ut melior vir  Non alius quisquam at tibi amicus at ingenium ingens  Inculto latet hoc sub corpore  Your friend is passionate perhaps unfit  For the brisk petulance of modern wit  His hair ill cut his robe that aukward flows  Or his large shoes to raillery expose  The man you love yet is he not possess'd  Of virtues with which very few are blest  While underneath this rude uncouth disguise  A genius of extensive knowledge lies  Francis's Hor Book i Sat    It remains to give a review of Johnson's works and this it is imagined will not be unwelcome to the reader  Like Milton and Addison he seems to have been fond of his Latin poetry Those compositions shew that he was an early scholar but his verses have not the graceful ease that gave so much suavity to the poems of Addison The translation of the Messiah labours under  two disadvantages it is first to be compared with Pope's inimitable performance and afterwards with the Pollio of Virgil It may appear trifling to remark that he has made the letter  o  in the word  Virgo  long and short in the same line VIRGO VIRGO PARIT But the translation has great merit and some admirable lines In the odes there is a sweet flexibility particularly To his worthy friend Dr Laurence on himself at the theatre March the Ode in the isle of Sky and that to Mrs Thrale from the same place  His English poetry is such as leaves room to think if he had devoted himself to the Muses that he would have been the rival of Pope His first production in this kind was London a poem in imitation of the third satire of Juvenal The vices of the metropolis are placed in the room of antient manners The author had heated his mind with the ardour of Juvenal and having the skill to polish his numbers he became a sharp accuser of the times The VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES is an imitation of the tenth satire of the same author Though it is translated  by Dryden Johnson's imitation approaches nearest to the spirit of the original The subject is taken from the ALCIBIADES of PLATO and has an intermixture of the sentiments of SOCRATES concerning the object of prayers offered up to the Deity The general proposition is that good and evil are so little understood by mankind that their wishes when granted are always destructive This is exemplified in a variety of instances such as riches statepreferment eloquence military glory long life and the advantages of form and beauty Juvenal's conclusion is worthy of a Christian poet and such a pen as Johnson's "Let us" he says  leave it to the Gods to judge what it fittest for us Man is dearer to his Creator than to himself If we must pray for special favour let it be for a sound mind in a sound body Let us pray for fortitude that we may think the labours of Hercules and all his sufferings preferable to a life of luxury and the soft repose of SARDANAPALUS This is a blessing within the reach of every man this we can give ourselves It is virtue and virtue only that can make us happy  In the translation  the zeal of the Christian conspired with the warmth and energy of the poet but Juvenal is not eclipsed For the various characters in the original the reader is pleased in the English poem to meet with Cardinal Wolsey Buckingham stabbed by Felton Lord Strafford Clarendon Charles XII of Sweden and for Tully and Demosthenes Lydiat Galileo and Archbishop Laud It is owing to Johnson's delight in biography that the name of LYDIAT is called forth from obscurity It may therefore not be useless to tell that LYDIAT was a learned divine and mathematician in the beginning of the last century He attacked the doctrine of Aristotle and Scaliger and wrote a number of sermons on the harmony of the Evangelists With all his merit he lay in the prison of  Bocardo  at Oxford till Bishop Usher Laud and others paid his debts He petitioned Charles I to be sent to Ethiopia to procure manuscripts Having spoken in favour of monarchy and bishops he was plundered by the Puritans and twice carried away a prisoner from his rectory He died very poor in  The Tragedy of Irene is founded on a passage in KNOLLES'S History of the Turks an author highly commended in the Rambler N  o  An incident in the Life of Mahomet the Great first emperor of the Turks is the hinge on which the fable is made to move The substance of the story is shortly this In Mahomet laid siege to Constantinople and having reduced the place became enamoured of a fair Greek whose name was IRENE The sultan invited her to embrace the law of the Prophet and to grace his throne Enraged at this intended marriage the Janizaries formed a conspiracy to dethrone the emperor To avert the impending danger Mahomet in a full assembly of the grandees  Catching with one hand  as KNOLLES relates it  the fair Greek by the hair of her head and drawing his falchion with the other he at one blow struck off her head to the great terror of them all and having so done said unto them Now by this judge whether your emperor is able to bridle his affections or not  The story is simple and it remained for the author to amplify it with proper  episodes and give it complication and variety The catastrophe is changed and horror gives place to terror and pity But after all the fable is cold and languid There is not throughout the piece a single situation to excite curiosity and raise a conflict of passions The diction is nervous rich and elegant but splendid language and melodious numbers will make a fine poem not a tragedy The sentiments are beautiful always happily expressed but seldom appropriated to the character and generally too philosophic What Johnson has said of the Tragedy of  Cato  may be applied to Irene  it is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language than a representation of natural affections Nothing excites or assuages emotion The events are expected without solicitude and are remembered without joy or sorrow Of the agents we have no care we consider not what they are doing nor what they are suffering we wish only to know what they have to say It is unaffecting elegance and chill philosophy  The following speech in the mouth of a Turk who is supposed to have  heard of the British constitution has been often selected from the numberless beauties with which IRENE abounds  "If there be any land as fame reports  Where common laws restrain the prince and subject  A happy land where circulating pow'r  Flows through each member of th' embodied state  Sure not unconscious of the mighty blessing  Her grateful sons shine bright with ev'ry virtue  Untainted with the LUST OF INNOVATION  Sure all unite to hold her league of rule  Unbroken as the sacred chain of Nature  That links the jarring elements in peace"  These are British sentiments Above forty years ago they found an echo in the breast of applauding audiences and to this hour they are the voice of the people in defiance of the  metaphysics  and the  new lights  of certain politicians who would gladly find their private advantage in the disasters of their country a race of men  quibus nulla ex honesto spes  The Prologue to Irene is written with elegance and in a peculiar strain shews the literary pride and lofty spirit of the author The  Epilogue we are told in a late publication was written by Sir William Young This is a new discovery but by no means probable When the appendages to a Dramatic Performance are not assigned to a friend or an unknown hand or a person of fashion they are always supposed to be written by the author of the Play It is to be wished however that the Epilogue in question could be transferred to any other writer It is the worst  Jeu d' Esprit  that ever fell from Johnson's pen  An account of the various pieces contained in this edition such as miscellaneous tracts and philological dissertations would lead beyond the intended limits of this essay It will suffice to say that they are the productions of a man who never wanted decorations of language and always taught his reader to think The life of the late king of Prussia as far as it extends is a model of the biographical style The Review of THE ORIGIN OF EVIL was perhaps written with asperity but the angry epitaph which it provoked from SOAME JENYNS was an illtimed resentment unworthy of the genius of that amiable author  The Rambler may be considered as Johnson's great work It was the basis of that high reputation which went on increasing to the end of his days The circulation of those periodical essays was not at first equal to their merit They had not like the Spectators the art of charming by variety and indeed how could it be expected The wits of queen Anne's reign sent their contributions to the Spectator and Johnson stood alone A stagecoach says Sir Richard Steele must go forward on stated days whether there are passengers or not So it was with the Rambler every Tuesday and Saturday for two years In this collection Johnson is the great moral teacher of his countrymen his essays form a body of ethics the observations on life and manners are acute and instructive and the papers professedly critical serve to promote the cause of literature It must however be acknowledged that a settled gloom hangs over the author's mind and all the essays except eight or ten coming from the same fountainhead no wonder that they have the raciness of the soil from which they sprung Of this uniformity  Johnson was sensible He used to say that if he had joined a friend or two who would have been able to intermix papers of a sprightly turn the collection would have been more miscellaneous and by consequence more agreeable to the generality of readers This he used to illustrate by repeating two beautiful stanzas from his own Ode to Cave or  Sylvanus Urban  Non ulla Musis pagina gratior  Qusm quae severis ludicra jungere  Novit fatigatamque nugis  Utilibus recreare mentem  Texente nymphis serta Lycoride  Rosae ruborem sic viola adjuvat  Immista sic Iris refulget  Aethereis variata fucis  It is remarkable that the pomp of diction which has been objected to Johnson was first assumed in the Rambler His Dictionary was going on at the same time and in the course of that work as he grew familiar with technical and scholastic words he thought that the bulk of his readers were equally learned or at least would admire the splendour and dignity of the  style And yet it is well known that he praised in Cowley the ease and unaffected structure of the sentences Cowley may be placed at the head of those who cultivated a clear and natural style Dryden Tillotson and Sir William Temple followed Addison Swift and Pope with more correctness carried our language well nigh to perfection Of Addison Johnson was used to say  He is the Raphael of Essay Writers  How he differed so widely from such elegant models is a problem not to be solved unless it be true that he took an early tincture from the writers of the last century particularly Sir Thomas Browne Hence the peculiarities of his style new combinations sentences of an unusual structure and words derived from the learned languages His own account of the matter is  When common words were less pleasing to the ear or less distinct in their signification I familiarized the terms of philosophy by applying them to popular ideas  But he forgot the observation of Dryden  If too many foreign words are poured in upon us it looks as if they were designed not to assist the natives but to conquer them  There is it must be admitted  a swell of language often out of all proportion to the sentiment but there is in general a fullness of mind and the thought seems to expand with the found of the words Determined to discard colloquial barbarisms and licentious idioms he forgot the elegant simplicity that distinguishes the writings of Addison He had what Locke calls a roundabout view of his subject and though he was never tainted like many modern wits with the ambition of shining in paradox he may be fairly called an ORIGINAL THINKER His reading was extensive He treasured in his mind whatever was worthy of notice but he added to it from his own meditation He collected  quae reconderet auctaque promeret  Addison was not so profound a thinker He was  born to write converse and live with ease  and he found an early patron in Lord Somers He depended however more upon a fine taste than the vigour of his mind His Latin Poetry shews that he relished with a just selection all the refined and delicate beauties of the Roman classics and when he cultivated his native language no wonder that he formed that graceful style which has been so justly admired simple yet  elegant adorned yet never overwrought rich in allusion yet pure and perspicuous correct without labour and though sometimes deficient in strength yet always musical His essays in general are on the surface of life if ever original it was in pieces of humour Sir Roger de Coverley and the Tory Foxhunter need not to be mentioned Johnson had a fund of humour but he did not know it nor was he willing to descend to the familiar idiom and the variety of diction which that mode of composition required The letter in the Rambler N  o  from a young girl that wants a place will illustrate this observation Addison possessed an unclouded imagination alive to the first objects of nature and of art He reaches the sublime without any apparent effort When he tells us  If we consider the fixed stars as so many oceans of flame that are each of them attended with a different set of planets if we still discover new firmaments and new lights that are sunk further in those unfathomable depths of aether we are lost in a labyrinth of suns and worlds and confounded with the magnificence and immensity of nature  the ease with which this  passage rises to unaffected grandeur is the secret charm that captivates the reader Johnson is always lofty he seems to use Dryden's phrase to be o'er inform'd with meaning and his words do not appear to himself adequate to his conception He moves in state and his periods are always harmonious His Oriental Tales are in the true style of Eastern magnificence and yet none of them are so much admired as the Visions of Mirza In matters of criticism Johnson is never the echo of preceding writers He thinks and decides for himself If we except the Essays on the Pleasures of Imagination Addison cannot be called a philosophical critic His moral Essays are beautiful but in that province nothing can exceed the Rambler though Johnson used to say that the Essay on  The burthens of mankind  in the Spectator N  o  was the most exquisite he had ever read Talking of himself Johnson said  Topham Beauclerk has wit and every thing comes from him with ease but when I say a good thing I seem to labour  When we compare him with Addison the contrast is still stronger Addison lends grace and ornament to truth Johnson gives it force and energy Addison  makes virtue amiable Johnson represents it as an awful duty Addison insinuates himself with an air of modesty Johnson commands like a dictator but a dictator in his splendid robes not labouring at the plough Addison is the Jupiter of Virgil with placid serenity talking to Venus  "Vultu quo coelum tempestatesque serenat"  Johnson is JUPITER TONANS he darts his lightning and rolls his thunder in the cause of virtue and piety The language seems to fall short of his ideas he pours along familiarizing the terms of philosophy with bold inversions and sonorous periods but we may apply to him what Pope has said of Homer  It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rises with it and forms itself about it like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense  It is not the design of this comparison to decide between those two eminent writers In  matters of taste every reader will chuse for himself Johnson is always profound and of course gives the fatigue of thinking Addison charms while he instructs and writing as he always does a pure an elegant and idiomatic style he may be pronounced the safest model for imitation  The essays written by Johnson in the Adventurer may be called a continuation of the Rambler The IDLER in order to be consistent with the assumed character is written with abatad vigour in a style of ease and unlaboured elegance It is the Odyssey after the Iliad Intense thinking would not become the IDLER The first number presents a welldrawn portrait of an Idler and from that character no deviation could be made Accordingly Johnson forgets his austere manner and plays us into sense He fill continues his lectures on human life but he adverts to common occurrences and is often content with the topic of the day An advertisement in the beginning of the first volume informs us that twelve entire Essays were a contribution from different hands One of these N  o  is the  journal of a Senior Fellow at Cambridge but as Johnson being himself an original thinker always revolted from servile imitation he has printed the piece with an apology importing that the journal of a citizen in the  Spectator  almost precluded the attempt of any subsequent writer This account of the Idler may be closed after observing that the author's mother being buried on the d of January there is an admirable paper occasioned by that event on Saturday the th of the same month N  o  The reader if he pleases may compare it with another fine paper in the Rambler N  o  on the conviction that rushes on the mind at the bed of a dying friend  "Rasselas" says Sir John Hawkins "is aspecimen of our language scarcely to be paralleled it is written in a style refined to a degree of  imaculate purity  and displays the whole force of  turgid  eloquence" One cannot but smile at this encomium Rasselas is undoubtedly both elegant and sublime It is a view of human life displayed it must be owned in gloomy colours The author's natural melancholy depressed at the time by the approaching dissolution  of his mother darkened the picture A tale that should keep curiosity awake by the artifice of unexpected incidents was not the design of a mind pregnant with better things He who reads the heads of the chapters will find that it is not a course of adventures that invites him forward but a discussion of interesting questions Reflections on Human Life the History of  Imlac  the Man of Learning a Dissertation upon Poetry the Character of a wise and happy Man who discourses with energy on the government of the passions and on a sudden when Death deprives him of his daughter forgets all his maxims of wisdom and the eloquence that adorned them yielding to the stroke of affliction with all the vehemence of the bitterest anguish It is by pictures of life and profound moral reflection that expectation is engaged and gratified throughout the work The History of the Mad Astronomer who imagines that for five years he possessed the regulation of the weather and that the sun passed from tropic to tropic by his direction represents in striking colours the sad effects of a distempered imagination It becomes the more affecting when we recollect  that it proceeds from one who lived in fear of the same dreadful visitation from one who says emphatically  Of the uncertainties in our present state the most dreadful and alarming is the uncertain continuance of reason  The enquiry into the cause of madness and the dangerous prevalence of imagination till in time some particular train of ideas fixes the attention and the mind recurs constantly to the favourite conception is carried on in a strain of acute observation but it leaves us room to think that the author was transcribing from his own apprehensions The discourse on the nature of the soul gives us all that philosophy knows not without a tincture of superstition It is remarkable that the vanity of human pursuits was about the same time the subject that employed both Johnson and Voltaire but  Candide  is the work of a lively imagination and Rasselas with all its splendour of eloquence exhibits a gloomy picture It should however be remembered that the world has known the WEEPING as well as the LAUGHING philosopher  The Dictionary does not properly fall within the province of this essay The preface however will be found in this edition He who reads the close of it without acknowledging the force of the pathetic and sublime must have more insensibility in his composition than usually sells to the share of man The work itself though in some instances abuse has been loud and in others malice has endeavoured to undermine its same still remains the MOUNT ATLAS of English Literature  Though storms and tempests thunder on its brow  And oceans break their b  lows at its seet  It stands unmov'd and glories in its height  That Johnson was eminently qualified for the office of a commentator on Shakspeare no man can doubt but it was an office which he never cordially embraced The publick expected more than he had diligence to perform and yet his edition has been the ground on which every subsequent commentator has chose to build One note for its singularity may be thought worthy of notice in this place Hamlet says  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a Godkissing carrion  In this  Warburton discovered the  origin of evil  Hamlet he says breaks off in the middle of the sentence but the learned commentator knows what he was going to say and being unwilling to keep the secret he goes on in a train of philosophical reasoning that leaves the reader in astonishment Johnson with true piety adopts the fanciful hypothesis declaring it to be a noble emendation which almost sets the critic on a level with the author The general observations at the end of the several plays and the preface will be found in this edition The former with great elegance and precision give a summary view of each drama The preface is a tract of great erudition and philosophical criticism  Johnson's political pamphlets whatever was his motive for writing them whether gratitude for his pension or the solicitation of men in power did not support the cause for which they were undertaken They are written in a style truly harmonious and with his usual dignity of language When it is said that he advanced positions repugnant to the  common rights of mankind  the virulence of party may  be suspected It is perhaps true that in the clamour raised throughout the kingdom Johnson over heated his mind but he was a friend to the rights of man and he was greatly superior to the littleness of sprit that might incline him to advance what he did not think and firmly believe In the  False Alarm  though many of the most eminent men in the kingdom concurred in petitions to the throne yet Johnson having well surveyed the mass of the people has given with great humour and no less truth what may be called  the birth parentage and education of a remonsirance  On the subject of Falkland's islands the fine dissuasive from too hastily involving the world in the calamities of war must extort applause even from the party that wished at that time for seenes or tumult and commotion It was in the same pamphlet that Johnson offered battle to JUNIUS a writer who by the uncommon elegance of his style charmed every reader though his object was to inflame the nation in favour of a faction Junius fought in the dark he saw his enemy and had his full blow while he himself remained safe in obscurity But let us not said Johnson mistake  the venom of the shaft for the vigour of the bow The keen invective which he published on that occasion promised a paperwar between two combatants who knew the use of their weapons A battle between them was as eagerly expected as between Mendoza and Big Ben But Junius whatever was his reason never returned to the field He laid down his arms and has ever since remained as secret as the MAN IN THE MASK in Voltaire's History  The account of his journey to the Hebrides or Western Isles of Scotland is a model for such as shall hereafter relate their travels The author did not visit that part of the world in the character of an Antiquary to amuse us with wonders taken from the dark and fabulous ages nor as a Mathematician to measure a degree and settle the longitude and latitude of the several islands Those who expected such information expected what was never intended  In every work regard the writer's end  Johnson went to see men and manners modes of life and the progress of civilization His remarks are so artfully blended with the  rapidity and elegance of his narrative that the reader is inclined to wish as Johnson did with regard to GRAY that  to travel and to tell his travels had been more of his employment  As to Johnson's Parliamentary Debates nothing with propriety can be said in this place They are collected in two volumes by Mr Stockdale and the flow of eloquence which runs through the several speeches is sufficiently known  It will not be useless to mention two more volumes which may form a proper supplement to this edition They contain a set of Sermons left for publication by John Taylor LLD The Reverend Mr Hayes who ushered these Discourses into the world has not given them as the compesition of Dr Taylor All he could say for his departed friend was that he left them in silence among his papers Mr Hayes knew them to be the production of a superior mind and the writer of these Memoirs owes it to the candour of that elegant scholar that he is now warranted to give an additional proof of Johnson's ardour in the cause of piety and every moral duty The last discourse in the collection was intended to be delivered by Dr  Taylor at the funeral of Johnson's wife but that Reverend gentleman declined the office because as he told Mr Hayes the praise of the deceased was too much amplified He who reads the piece will find it a beautiful moral lesson written with temper and no where overcharged with ambitious ornaments The rest of the Discourses were the fund which Dr Taylor from time to time carried with him to his pulpit He had the LARGEST BULL  See Johnson's Letters from Ashbourne in Vol XII of this edition  in England and some of the best Sermons  We come now to the Lives of the Poets a work undertaken at the age of seventy yet the most brilliant and certainly the most popular of all our Author's writings For this performance he needed little preparation Attentive always to the history of letters and by his own natural bias fond of Biography he was the more willing to embrace the proposition of the Booksellers He was versed in the whole body of English Poetry and his rules of criticism were settled with precision The differtation in the Life of Cowley on the metaphysical Poets of the last century has the attraction of  novelty as well as sound observation The writers who followed Dr Donne went in quest of something better then truth and nature As Sancho says in Don Qnixotte they wanted better bread than is made with wheat They took pains to bewilder themselves and were ingenious for no other purpose than to err In Johnson's review of Cowley's works false wit is detected in all its shapes and the Gothic taste for glittering conceits and farfetched allusions is exploded never it is hoped to revive again  An author who has published his observations on the Life and Writings of Dr Johnson speaking of the Lives of the Poets says  These compositions abounding in strong and acute remark and with many fine and even sublime passages have unquestionably great merit but if they be regarded merely as containing narrations of the Lives delineations of the characters and strictures of the several authors they are far from being always to be depended on  He adds  The characters are sometimes partial and there is sometimes TOO MUCH MALIGNITY of misrepresentation  to which perhaps may be joined no inconsiderable portion of erroneous criticism  The several clauses of this censure deserve to be answered as fully as the limits of this essay will permit  In the first place the facts are related upon the best instelligence and the best vouchers that could be gleaned after a great lapse of time Probability was to be inferred from such materials as could be procured and no man better understood the nature of historical evidence than Dr Johnson no man was more religiously an observer of truth If his History is any where defective it must be imputed to the want of better information and the errors of uncertain tradition  Ad nos vix tenuis famae perlabitur aura  If the strictures on the works of the various authors are not always satisfactory and if erroneous criticism may sometimes be suspected who can hope that in matters of taste all shall agree The instances in which the public mind has differed from the positions advanced by the author are few in number It has  been said that justice has not been done to Swift that Gay and Prior are undervalued and that Gray has been harshly treated This charge perhaps ought not to be disputed Johnson it is well known had conceived a prejudice against Swift His friends trembled for him when he was writing that life but were pleased at last to see it executed with temper and moderation As to Prior it is probable that he gave his real opinion but an opinion that will not be adopted by men of lively fancy With regard to Gray when he condemns the apostrophe in which Father Thames is desired to tell who drives the hoop Of tosses the ball and then adds that Father Thames had no better means of knowing than himself when he compares the abrupt beginning of the first stanza of the bard to the ballad of JOHNNY ARMSTRONG  "Is there ever a man in all Scotland"  there are perhaps few friends of Johnson who would not wish to blot out both the passages It may be questioned whether the remarks on Pope's Essay on Man can be received without great caution It has been already mentioned that Crousaz a professor in Switzerland eminent for his Treatise of Logic  started up a professed enemy to that poem Johnson says  his mind was one of those in which philosophy and piety are happily united He looked with distrust upon all metaphysical systems of theology and was persuaded that the positions of Pope were intended to draw mankind away from Revelation and to represent the whole course of things as a necessary concatenation of indissoluble fatality  This is not the place for a controversy about the Leibnitzian system Warburton with all the powers of his large and comprehensive mind publishied a Vindication of Pope and yet Johnson says that  in many passages a religious eye may easily discover expressions not very favourable to morals or to liberty  This sentence is severe and perhaps dogmatical Crousaz wrote an Examen of THE ESSAY ON MAN and afterwards a Commentary on every remarkable passage and though it now appears that Mrs Elizabeth Carter translated the foreign Critic yet it is certain that Johnson encouraged the work and perhaps imbibed those early prejudices which adhered to him to the end of his life He shuddered at the idea of irreligion  Hence we are told in the Life of Pope  Never were penury of knowledge and vulgarity of sentiment so happily disguised Pope in the chair of wisdom tells much that every man knows and much that he did not know himself and gives us comfort in the position that  though man's a fool yet God is wise  that human advantages are unstable that our true honour is not to have a great part but to act it well that virtue only is our own and that happiness is always in our power The reader when he meets all this in its new array no longer knows the talk of his mother and his nurse  But may it not be said that every system of ethics must or ought to terminate in plain and general maxims for the use of life and though in such axioms no discovery is made does not the beauty of the moral theory consist in the premises and the chain of reasoning that leads to the conclusion May not truth as johnson himself says be conveyed to the mind by a new train of intermediate images Pope's doctrine about the ruling passion does not seem to be refuted though it is called in harsh terms pernicious as well as false tending to establish a kind of moral predestination  or overruling principle which cannot be resisted But Johnson was too easily alarmed in the cause of religion Organized as the human race is individuals have different inlets of perception different powers of mind and different sensations of pleasure and pain  All spread their charms but charm not all alike  On different senses different objects strike  Hence different passions more or less inflame  As strong or weak the organs of the frame  And hence one masterpassion in the breast  Like Aaron's serpent swallows up the rest  Brumoy says Pascal from his infancy felt himself a geometrician and Vandyke in like manner was a painter Shakspeare who of all poets had the deepest insight into human nature was aware of a prevailing bias in the operations of every mind By him we are told  Masterless passion sways us to the mood of what it likes or looths  It remains to enquire whether in the lives before us the characters are partial and too often drawn with malignity of misrepresentation To prove this it is alledged that Johnson has misrepresented the circumstances relative to the  translation of the first Iliad and maliciously ascribed that performance to Addison instead of Tickell with too much reliance on the testimony of Pope taken from the account in the papers left by Mr Spence For a refutation of the fallacy imputed to Addison we are referred to a note in the  Biographia Britannica  written by the late  Judge Blackstone  who it is said examined the whole matter with accuracy and found that the first regular statement of the accusation against Addison was published by Ruffhead in his Life of Pope from the materials which he received from Dr Warburton But with all due deference to the learned Judge whose talents deserve all praise this account is by no means accurate  Sir Richard Steele in a dedication of the Comedy of the Drummer to Mr Congreve gave the first insight into that business He says in a style of anger and resentment  If that gentleman Mr Tickell thinks himself injured I will allow I have wronged him upon this issue that if the reputed translator of the first book of Homer shall please to give us another book there shall appear  another good judge in poetry besides Mr Alexander Pope who shall like it  The authority of Steele outweighs all opinions founded on vain conjecture and indeed seems to be decisive since we do not find that Tickell though warmly pressed thought proper to vindicate himself  But the grand proof of Johnson's malignity is the manner in which he has treated the character and conduct of Milton To enforce this charge has wearied sophistry and exhausted the invention of a party What they cannot deny they palliate what they cannot prove they say is probable But why all this rage against Dr Johnson Addison before him had said of Milton  Oh had the Poet ne'er prophan'd his pen  To varnish o'er the guilt of faithless men  And had not Johnson an equal right to avow his sentiments Do his enemies claim a privilege to abuse whatever is valuable to Englishmen either in Church or State and must the liberty of UNLICENSED PRINTING be denied to the friends of the British constitution  It is unnecessary to pursue the argument through all its artifices since dismantled of ornament and seducing language the plain truth may be stated in a narrow compass Johnson knew that Milton was a republican he says  an acrimonious and surly republican for which it is not known that he gave any better reason than that a popular government was the most frugal for the trappings of a monarchy would set up an ordinary commonwealth  Johnson knew that Milton talked  aloud of the danger of READMITTING KINGSHIP in this nation and when Milton adds that a commonwealth was commended or rather ENJOINED by our Saviour himself to all Christians not without a remarkable disallowance and the brand of Gentilism UPON KINGSHIP  Johnson thought him no better than a wild enthusiast He knew as well as Milton  that the happiness of a nation must needs be firmest and certainest in a full and free council of their own electing where no single person but reason only sways  but the example of all the republics recorded in the annals of mankind gave him no room  to hope that REASON ONLY would be heard He knew that the republican form of government having little or no complication and no consonance of parts by a nice mechanism forming a regular whole was too simple to be beautiful even in theory In practice it perhaps never existed In its most flourishing state at Athens Rome and Carthage it was a constant scene of tumult and commotion From the mischiefs of a wild democracy the progress has ever been to the dominion of an aristocracy and the word aristocracy fatally includes the boldest and most turbulent citizens who rise by their crimes and call themselves the best men in the State By intrigue by cabal and faction a pernicious oligarchy is sure to succeed and end at last in the tyranny of a single ruler Tacitus the great master of political wisdom saw under the mixed authority of king nobles and people a better form of government than Milton's boasted republic and what Tacitus admired in theory but despaired of enjoying Johnson saw established in this country He knew that it had been overturned by the rage of frantic men but he knew that after the iron rod of Cromwell's usurpation  the constitution was once more restored to its first principles Monarchy was established and this country was regenerated It was regenerated a second time at the Revolution the rights of men were then defined and the blessings of good order and civil liberty have been ever since diffused through the whole community  The peace and happiness of society were what Dr Johnson had at heart He knew that Milton called his Defence of the Regicides a defence of the people of England but however glossed and varnished he thought it an apology for murder Had the men who under a shew of liberty brought their king to the scaffold proved by their subsequent conduct that the public good inspired their actions the end might have given some sanction to the means but usurpation and slavery followed Milton undertook the office of secretary under the despotic power of Cromwell offering the incense of adulation to his master with the titles of  Director of public Councils the Leader of unconquered Armies the Father of his Country  Milton declared at the same time that  nothing is more pleasing to God or  more agreeable to reason than that the highest mind should have the sovereign power  In this strain of servile flattery Milton gives us the right divine of tyrants But it seems in the same piece he exhorts Cromwell  not to desert those great principles of liberty which he had professed to espouse for it would be a grievous enormity if after having successfully opposed tyranny he should himself act the part of a tyrant and betray the cause that he had defended  This desertion of every honest principle the advocate for liberty lived to see Cromwell acted the tyrant and with vile hypocrisy told the people that he had consulted the Lord and the Lord would have it so Milton took an under part in the tragedy Did that become the defender of the people of England Brutus saw his country enslaved he struck the blow for freedom and he died with honour in the cause Had he lived to be secretary under Tiberius what would now be said of his memory  But still it seems the prostitution with which Milton is charged since it cannot be defended is to be retorted on the character of Johnson  For this purpose a book has been published called  Remarks on Dr Johnson's Life of Milton to which are added Milton's Tractate of Education and Areopagitica  In this laboured tract we are told  There is one performance ascribed to the pen of the Doctor where the prostitution is of so singular a nature that it would be difficult to select an adequate motive for it out of the mountainous heap of conjectural causes of human passions or human caprice It is the speech of the late unhappy Dr William Dodd when he was about to hear the sentence of the law pronounced upon him in consequence of an indictment for forgery The voice of the publick has given the honour of manufacturing this speech to Dr Johnson and the style and configuration of the speech itself confirm the imputation But it is hardly possible to divine what could be his motive for accepting the office A man to express the precise state of mind of another about to be destined to an ignominious death for a capital crime should one would imagine have some consciousness that he himself had incurred some guilt of the same kind  In all the schools of sophistry is  there to be found so vile an argument In the purlieus of Grubstreet is there such another mouthfull of dirt In the whole quiver of Malice is there so envenomed a shaft  After this it is to be hoped that a certain class of men will talk no more of Johnson's malignity The last apology for Milton is that he acted according to his principles But Johnson thought those principles detestable pernicious to the constitution in Church and State destructive of the peace of society and hostile to the great fabric of civil policy which the wisdom of ages has taught every Briton to revere to love and cherish He reckoned Milton in that class of men of whom the Roman historian says when they want by a sudden convulsion to overturn the government they roar and clamour for liberty if they succeed they destroy liberty itself  Ut imperium evertant Libertatem praeferunt fi perverterint libertatem ipsam aggredientur  Such were the sentiments of Dr Johnson and it may be asked in the language of Bolingbroke  Are these sentiments which any man who is born a Briton in any circumstances in any  situation ought to be ashamed or afraid to avow  Johnson has done ample justice to Milton's poetry the Criticism on Paradise Lost is a sublime composition Had he thought the author as good and pious a citizen as Dr Watts he would have been ready notwithstanding his nonconformity to do equal honour to the memory of the man  It is now time to close this essay which the author fears has been drawn too much into length In the progress of the work feeble as it may be he thought himself performing the last human office to the memory of a friend whom he loved esteemed and honoured  His saltem accumulem donis et fungar inani  Munere  The author of these memoirs has been anxious to give the features of the man and the true character of the author He has not suffered the hand of partiality to colour his excellencies with too much warmth nor has he endeavoured to throw his singularities too much into shade Dr Johnson's failings may well be forgiven for the sake of his virtues His defects were spots in the sun His piety his kind affections and the  goodness of his heart present an example worthy of imitation His works will remain a monument of genius and of learning Had he written nothing but what is contained in this edition the quantity shews a life spent in study and meditation If to this we add the labour of his Dictionary and other various productions it may be fairly allowed as he used to say of himself that he has written his share In the volumes here presented to the publick the reader will find a perpetual source of pleasure and instruction With due precautions authors may learn to grace their style with elegance harmony and precision they may be taught to think with vigour and perspicuity and to crown the whole by a diligent attention to these books all may advance in virtue  FINIS
