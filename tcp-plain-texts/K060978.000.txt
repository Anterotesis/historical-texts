 AN ODE TO TRAGEDY  By a GENTLEMAN of SCOTLAND  EDINBURGH Printed by A DONALDSON and J REID For ALEX DONALDSON MDCLXI  Price SIX PENCE  TO JAMES BOSWELL  Esq  MY DEAR SIR  IF  Adam Fitzadam  presumed to inscribe a volume of the WORLD to MR MOORE I can see no reason why I  a Gentleman of Scotland  may not take much the same liberty with MR BOSWELL  Do not imagine Sir because this address comes in the form of a dedication that I have been invoking the goddess of Flattery Indeed I have no intention to pay your compliments not that your discernment is so nice as to reject them with indignation but because it is my sincere opinion that they would do you harm To entertain agreeable notions of one's own character is a great incentive to act with propriety and spirit But I should be sorry to contribute in any degree to your acquiring an excess of selfsufficiency  To talk thus freely is certainly a proof that I wish  you well and I make no doubt Sir but you consider me as your very good friend although some people and those too not destitute of wisdomwill not scruple to insinuate the contrary  Be that as it may give me leave to thank you for your particular kindness to me and chiefly for the profound respect with which you have always treated me  I own indeed that when I have boasted of a glimpse of regard from the finest eyes and most amiable heart in the world or to display my extensive erudition have quoted Greek Latin and French sentences one after another with astonishing celerity or have got into my  Oldhock humour  and fallen araving about princes and lords knights and geniuses ladies of quality and harpsichordsyou with a peculiar comic smile have gently reminded me of the  importance of a man to himself  and slily left the room with the witty DEAN lying open at  P P clerk of this parish  The following ODE which courts your acceptance is on a subject grave and solemn and therefore may be considered by many people as not so well suited to  your volatile disposition But I Sir who enjoy the pleasure of your intimate acquaintance know that many of your hours of retirement are devoted to thought and that you can as strongly relish the productions of a serious Muse as the most brilliant sallies of sportive Fancy  As to my merit as a poet I shall only say that while I am certain of YOUR approbation I shall be entirely satisfied and if I can any how improve the noble feelings of that honest open heart of yours I shall reckon myself infinitely happy  I must now bid you farewell with an assurance that while you continue the man that you are you shall ever find me with the greatest sincerity and affection  MY DEAR SIR  Yours  c  ODE TO TRAGEDY  I  GODDESS supreme whose power divine  The yielding Passions all obey  On me O with thy influence shine  O send a spark to fire each lay  A soul by nature form'd to feel  Grief sharper than the tyrants steel  And bosom big with swelling thought  From ancient lore's remembrance brought  Prompt me with pinions bold my way to wing  And like the skylark at heaven's gate to sing  II  Come mistress of superior grace  Daughter in hour sublime of Jove  O'er the strong features of whose face  With air of distant awe we rove  While mingling softness to the eye  Seems o'er each lineament to fly  As when the sun's resplendent rays  In summer glow with redd'ning blaze  A floating blueting'd cloud does interveen  And thro' a veil the sire of light is seen  III  Come Muse while Terror's ghastly form  And Pity gentle maid appear  Or to assault the soul by storm  Or steal the generous heartsprung tear  While they attendant on thy state  Submissive thy behests await  Dread as a hideous lion chain'd  And Pity's looks with crying stain'd  O in thy dazzling majesty advance  Thou who thro' nature shoot'st with eagle glance  IV  'Tis thine the soul to humanize  By fancied woGoddess 'tis thine  To bid compassion melt the eyes  And all the feelings soft refine  'Tis thine with great Apollo's skill  The inmost springs of life to thrill  'Tis thine to move a breast of stone  And make a brazen heart to own  That solemn tragic numbers are of force  To stop a villain in his bloody course  V  Behold the buskin'd bard of Greece  Th' inchantment of whose tuneful shell  Could sooth the mind to gentle peace  Or rouse to fury sprung from hell  See in his kindling look the fire  Bright flaming from his golden lyre  Hark how he sweeps the stringssuch tones  Nature design'd affliction's groans  I feel when now he wakes another strain  The love of glory panting in each vein  VI  Unhappy Oedipus thy fate  Gods for one mortal how severe  While Sophocles deigns to relate  In pomp of sadness shall appear  The direful oracle we dread  While on thy bare dejected head  We see the black tempest'ous shower  Of Fortune's wrath incessant pour  We see a wretch o'er boiling eddies tost  Till in a gulf of wo the victim's lost  VII  O say thou arbitress of mind  What sympathy unites our race  That even in savages we find  This wondrous tender human grace  How is the heart of man so soft  Which I alas have felt too oft  How are we mov'd with others wo  How do the streams of pity flow  How does the breast with throbs spontaneous beat  How is compassion found so strangely sweet  VIII  Hail father of the British stage  Shakespear to whom shall still belong  Thro' each successive wond'ring age  The glories of immortal song  Melpomene with aspect mild  With joyful hope exulting smil'd  What time on Avon's banks she saw  Thee young thy first rude sketches draw  Of richest poesy whose strains sublime  Already aim'd th' empyreum's height to climb  IX  Genius unbounded as the sky  That spreads itself from pole to pole  Disdains a formal course to fly  Or sweep the ground with lazy stole  The Stagyrite may preach in vain  And tasteless critics cold complain  That thou all rules of art hast broke  And flung away the stated yoke  To the kind heart alone thou dost appeal  And bidst th' ingenuous there conviction feel  X  Say thou th' illustrious poet's shade  Whether old Westminster's fam'd dome  Thou haunt'st or where his childhood stray'd  And where his bones have fix'd their home  O say from whence such powers he drew  By which the universe he knew  Ye ghosts and beings of the brain  Witches and all the magic train  You he could lively paint with pencil nice  And scourge by force infernal blasted vice  XI  Greatest of bards O hear my prayer  Gleam on my soul with chearing view  Yet think not that I rashly dare  One of thy footsteps to pursue  How have I in my youthful age  Ador'd to see the passions rage  As when her swain with Juliet strove  Who felt the anguish most of love  Or when Old England's annals were display'd  And Piercy storm'd in martial fire array'd  XII  Forgive tho' I forbear to tell  Of you ye other bards who shine  Forgive tho' I forbear to swell  With croud of names the sounding line  When Oroonoko's godlike soul  By misery distracted roll  In gloomy bloodstreak'd eyes we see  Can any bosom ruthless be  Will not a hapless orphan make us weep  Or Randolph's lady plung'd in sorrows deep  XIII  Augusta's theatreswith pride  How often have I witness'd there  The lucid pearls of pity glide  From lovely eyes of British fair  How often have I raptur'd seen  The passion of the present queen  With uncontroll'd applauses loud  Burn in each feature of the croud  Lo boundless liberty submissive deigns  Triumph how great to wear the actor's chains  XIV  See Garrick in poor Lear rave  Borne down the tide of sore distress  He seems 'gainst each o'erwhelming wave  With hoary majesty to press  See Sheridan in Denmark's heir  Wide spreads the prospect of despair  With dusky clouds the sky is hung  Pale horror falters on his tongue  Torn is his wretched mind ev'n now I view  Cold painwrought drops his mournful face bedew  XV  O why by Cam's delightful streams  Does  Mr Mason  he who sung  Elfrida  's wo  Indulge his warm poetic dreams  But to the private eye to show  Why does the moralizing train  The ancient chorus  Him from the world's just glass detain  Beams not bright beauty brighter still  From the high summit of yon hill  Drive him Ambition from th' inglorious seat  Tho'  Hurd  approve his indolent retreat  XVI  Goddess supreme my vows attend  O let the honour'd task be mine  Thy temple trembling to ascend  Trembling to offer at thy shrine  While idle Folly's glitt'ring train  Bask in the sunshine ever vain  Like Juno's bird so pert and gay  Their gaudy plumage still display  O let me visit oft thy sacred store  And in ecstatic heat intranc'd adore  FINIS
