 A DISSERTATION ON ANECDOTES  BY THE AUTHOR OF  CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE  LONDON PRINTED FOR C AND G KEARSLEY N  o  AND J MURRAY N  o  FLEETSTREET  PREFACE  THE art of prefacewriting is perhaps the art of concealing the anxiety of an author There are some works which require nor preface nor anxiety the present trifle merits neither yet I cannot refrain from bestowing on it a little of both  A Dissertation demands and I confess it a certain systematical regularity which is above me But a Dissertation on Anecdotes is a thing so eccentric that if on the whole  my pages are not found to weary the reader it is just that he should have the candour not to complain if it does not precisely answer the idea he may form of a Dissertation  I am even desirous that this Essay may not be considered as destitute of connection because at the first glance it may thus appear The work consists not of a mere mass of loose anecdotes these are given as sketches of the manner in which various topics may be conducted and elucidate those reflections on the nature of anecdotes which if they shall be found to be pertinent is all of which I am solicitous In my notes I have taken a greater freedom of discussion but this has been to use the language of a master in literary composition  'with the honest desire of giving useful pleasure'  There is a singularity respecting the word  Anecdote  which it is not here improper to notice Anecdotes is an appellation given by scholars to Mss which they discovered in libraries and afterwards published This term is strictly according to its Grecian derivation  i e things not yet published Thus Cicero as Moreri observes gave the name of Anecdote to a work which he had not yet published  We have borrowed the use of this word in its ordinary signification from the French who employ it for any interesting circumstance In this sense Varillas published Anecdotes of the family of the Medicis  Johnson has imperfectly defined the word by saying that  'It is now used after the  French for a  biographical incident  a minute passage of  private life  '  This confines its signification merely to  biography  but anecdotes are susceptible of a more enlarged application This word is more justly defined in the Cyclopaedia  'a term which now denotes a relation of detached and interesting particulars'  We give  anecdotes  of the art as well as the Artist of the war as well as the General of the nation as well as of the Monarch  I conclude by observing that if a series of anecdotes shall be found capable of illustrating any individual topic we yet want a collection of such anecdotes A writer for this purpose should unite to the ardour of research a solid judgment and a correct taste Yet with all these qualifications I  am fearful that the world would be more inclined to commend his industry than distinguish his talents It is therefore not probable that a man of genius will condescend to arrange anecdotes and we must lament that the fastidiousness of superficial minds deters the ingenious student from giving the world literary speculations the most instructive and the most delightful  September  A DISSERTATION ON ANECDOTES  A Writer of periodical criticism  The British Critic for July p  has given some observations on ANECDOTES which because they echo the voice of several men of letters it may not be improper to investigate The opinions of our critic to me appear erroneous because they regard anecdotes as only agreeable objects of literary amusement A writer should correct others or correct himself I therefore hazard this essay A dry dissertation on anecdotes appears thorny let us try if we cannot discover blossoms and flowers  The critic says  'Anecdotes are among the luxuries of literature'  and he is  'fearful that the mind should be accustomed to them and reject severer diet'  I rejoice  however to be informed in the same paragraph that  'they stimulate the appetite for reading and create it where deficient'  This logic is not in the happiest manner of Bayle  I will not deny that anecdotes are to be placed among literary luxuries The refinement of a nation influences the genius of its literature we now require not only a solid repast but a delicious dessert A physician austere as Hippocrates a critic rigid as Aristotle are alike inimical to our refreshments We will not be fooled into their systems We do not dismiss our fruits and and our wines from our tables we eat and our health remains unprejudiced We read anecdotes with voluptuous delight nor is our science impaired or our wit rendered less brilliant  The day has past when persevering dullness obtained the honours of literary eminence A vigorous memory was then the only talent required in the scholar he was the greatest genius who read most Our age does not think highly of those names once so celebrated Learning in its present diffusion will only please as it is founded  on a solid judgment and embellished by the graces of a fine taste  On this subject Scaliger has made a judicious observation He says  'If a person's  learning  is to be judged of by his  reading  nobody can deny Eusebius the character of a learned man but if he is to be esteemed learned who has shewn  judgment  together with his  reading  Eusebius is not such'    It is therefore not just to consider anecdotes merely as a source of entertainment because they amuse if it shall be sound that they serve also for the purposes of utility they will deserve to be classed higher in the scale of study than hitherto they have been  Anecdotes seldom read with reflection  All the world read anecdotes but not many with reflection and still fewer with taste To most one anecdote resembles another a little unconnected story that is heard that pleases and is forgotten Yet when anecdotes are not merely transcribed but animated by judicious reflections they recal others of a kindred nature one suggests another and the whole series is made to illustrate some topic that gratifies curiosity or impresses on the mind some interesting conclusion in the affairs of human life Like the concord of notes one depends on the other and the whole forms a perfect harmony  We will take a review of some of those effects which anecdotes appear capable of producing  The most agreeable parts of History consist in it's anecdotes  History itself derives some of it's most agreeable instructions from a skilful introduction of anecdotes We should not now dwell with anxiety on a dull chronicle of the reigns of monarchs a parish register might prove more interesting We are not now solicitous of attending to battles which have ceased to alarm to sieges which can destroy none of our towns and to storms which can never burst upon our shores We turn with disgust from fictions told without the grace of fable and from truths uninteresting as fables told without grace  Romancers have existed in all nations under the names of historians from the notorious Geffrey of Monmouth to Jean le Maire who in his Illustrations of Gaul makes the French nation descend from the fugitive princes of Troy This is not quite so marvellous as the eccentric follies of several  modern  Irish antiquaries Col V has pushed his national researches as far back as the time of the deluge Since he was so employed he might have gone further for an old writer has even favoured us with the names of the  seven Irish Kings  who flourished  before Noah  Mr T Warton in his observations on the FaÃ«ry Queen notices one of Geffrey's fables This monk in his account of the original state of Albion has these words  'Erat tunc nomen insulae Albion quae a nemine nisi a  paucis gigantibus  inhabitabatur'  A  few giants  in that historian's opinion were but of little consideration  Our hearts have learnt to sympathise and we consult the annals of history  as a son and a brother would turn over his domestic memoirs We read history not to indulge the frivolous inquisitiveness of a dull antiquary but to explore into the causes of the miseries and the prosperities of our country We are more interested in the progress of the human mind than in that of empires  A Hearne would feel a frigid rapture if he could discover the name of a Saxon monarch unrecorded in our annals and of whom as little should remain as of the doubtful bones of a Saxon dug out of a tumulus Such are his anecdotesA Hume is only interested with those characters who have exerted themselves in the cause of humanity and with those incidents which have subverted or established the felicities of a people  There will always be antiquaries who will solace themselves with the hope that dull industry will compensate for a total want of the energy of genius Such will not discern when minute enquiry dwindles into frivolous inutility The elegance and the reflection of Hume are regarded with contempt by these unenlightened students and they condemn the philosopher precisely for what he is most to be commended for not wasting his pages on researches that resemble conjectures into our Saxon annals which if they could be known with accuracy would not be more interesting than the annals of the Abyssinians over which many a reader of taste has groaned in the bulky volumes of Mr Bruce But on the subject of such remote antiquities I shall transcribe a conversation recorded by Mr Boswel apologizing for quoting a book which is in the hands of every one On our antiquarian researches Johnson said  'All that is really  known  of the ancient state of Britain is contained in a  few pages  We can know no more than what the old writers have told us yet what large books have we upon it the whole of which excepting such parts as are taken from those old writers is all a dream such as Whitaker's ManchesterI have heard Henry's history of Great Britain well spoken of I am told it is carried on in separate divisions as the civil the military the religious history I wish much to have one branch well done and that is  the history of manners  of common life'  Robertson answered  'Henry should have applied his attention to that  alone  which is enough for any man'  Vol iii p    Anecdotes serve as materials for the history of manners  Hence the history of manners has become the prime object of the researches of philosophers How is this prominent feature in history to be depicted The artist must not here draw at fancy a beautiful or fantastical line He must regard his object with minute attention and he must reflect long on a thousand little strokes which are to give the faithful resemblance The historian must  assiduously arrange the minute anecdotes of the age he examines he must oftener have recourse to the diaries of individuals than to the archives of a nation Nothing however minute must escape his research though every thing is not to be reported  It must be confessed that our antiquarian studies begin to rank high in the mind of the philosopher They seem to be directed to the illustration not merely of obliterated inscriptions but of ancient manners The sepulchral monuments of Mr Gough form a splendid work of this kind which has deservedly gained their author the distinguished title of the English Montfaucon We may observe of what importance in this interesting topic are the memorandums of an individual from the recovery of the book of the Master of the Revels which Mr Malone has been so fortunate as to obtain We enter more fully into the genius of those times from such publications than from the superficial accounts and fanciful conjectures of any modern writer He who would penetrate further into these amusing researches must apply himself to a close examination of those to volumes of old plays which Mr Garrick has deposited in the British Museum to a patient perusal of innumerable Mss and to the collecting matter from the printed books of the times The prospect looks boundless and dreary it appears at a distance a dark forest yet when once explored with ardour it wants not occasional sunshine to cheer us and vernal banks to repose on    Various anecdotes illustrating the history of manners  To inform the world that in the xvith Century bishops only were permitted the use of silk that princes and princesses only had the prerogative of wearing scarlet clothes either of silk or of wool and that only  princes and bishops had a right to wear shoes made of silksuch anecdotes would appear trivial in the hands of a mere antiquary but they become important when touched by a philosophical historian These little particulars awaken in the mind of Voltaire an admirable reflection he says  "All these sumptuary laws only shew that the government of these times had not always great objects in their view and that it appeared easier for ministers to proscribe than to encourage industry"  Had I to sketch the situation of the Jews in the ninth century and to exhibit at the same time the character of that age of bigotry could I do it more effectually than by the following anecdote which a learned friend who will one day be celebrated for his historical researches discovered in some manuscript records  A jew of Rouen in Normandy sells a house to a christian inhabitant of that city After some time of residence a storm happens lightning falls on the house and does considerable damage The christian unenlightened villainous and pious cites the trembling descendant of Israel into  court for  damages  His eloquent counsellor hurls an admirable philippic against this detestable nation of heretics and concludes by proving that it was owing to this house having been the interdicted property of an Israelite that a thunderbolt fell upon the roof The judges as it may be supposed were not long in terminating this suit They decreed that God had damaged this house as a mark of his vengeance against the property of a jew and that therefore it was just the repairs should be at his cost  Perhaps it is to be acknowledged that the judges were merciful and the jew fortunate To be condemned to rebuild a house is better than to be burnt with some of it's old wood  I shall add one more instance which may prove that it is alone by anecdotes the genius of an age or nation is thoroughly to be understood  The French nation before their singular revolution displayed a splendid scene of refinement of luxury and of frivolity which perhaps was never yet presented to the eye of the philosopher on this theatre of the world In reading the secret memoirs of  that country a scandalous chronicle which was carried on for above thirty years one gathers many curious particulars which can only be found in these fugitive leaves Religion was forbidden them by the philosophers and politics by the government They exhausted their active and volatile genius on the objects of taste taste that they contrived should be the image of both for it had it's heresies and it's parties The theatre and the bookseller's shop formed the great concerns of the Parisian Voltaire was more to be dreaded than the prime minister and Mad Clairon their celebrated actress appears to have enjoyed the sovereignty of Paris  Sometimes we observe that a publication ferments the town for a week the minister sends the author to the Bastille for a month the book is publicly burnt forbidden to be sold and every body has it by heart The police sometimes is so rigid as to put an embargo on all Mss to imprison censors of books because they suffered passages to be printed which appear to the court of an offensive nature in a word several printers are compelled to sell their founts and a dismal  barrenness appears in the literature of France  Sometimes we perceive theatrical representations to be the objects of ministerial vengeance They forbid a particular play whose subject might be applicable to the moment or even a particular passage of a play which the malicious actor pronounced with emphasis I give an instance of the latter in the note underneath  On the th February in playing Tancred Mad Clairon when she came to these verses  'On depouille Tancrede on l'exile on l'outrage  'C'est le sort d'un Heros d'etre persecutÃ©  'Tout son parti se tait qui sera son appui  'Sa gloire  'Un Heros qu'on opprime attendrit tous les coeurs'  This sublime actress made such inflexions of her voice so noble and so penetrating that all the audience recollected the event of that day which was a lettre de cachet the Marquis de Broglio had received His name flew from mouth to mouth says my reporter and the representation was frequently interrupted by the loud applauses which were continually renewed  The next day the house was forbidden to act the tragedy of Tancred in consequence of what had passed on the preceding representation  But it is not my intention to fill up an elaborate picture of the French nation at these moments that probably will soon occupy  the contemplation of men of able talents  But I would give one striking example of the national character at this period and for this purpose I employ the following anecdotes  MolÃ© a favourite actor falls ill and is confined to his chamber when this is announced from the stage the gaiety of Paris suddenly lours with gloom The next day his door is besieged by enquiring crouds his health is the conversation of all companies It appeared as if Scipio lay confined and the virtuous Romans passed their hours in melancholy anxiety for the life of their protector The physicians find MolÃ© in an exhausted state and prescribe a free use of wine This prescription is soon known in the circles at Paris and MolÃ© finds two thousand bottles of the finest Burgundy sent to his house from various quarters MolÃ© at length recovers all Paris rejoices and rushes to his benefit Such was the public ardour that it produced him the amazing sum of livres MolÃ© gratefully receives the valuable tribute of their applause he was in debt and the benefit formed all  his fortune How then does MolÃ© apply his livres An Englishman would have purchased an annuity or perhaps have paid his debts MolÃ© runs to the jeweller takes its amount in brilliants and gives them to his mistress who boasts that she wears all the honours of the public  This serves to display at once the frivolity of the nation and of the individual All Paris is concerned for the indisposition of an actor and all terminates in giving diamonds to an impudent brunette  Histories compared with memoirs  Of the eminent personages in history we have many differing characters We know well how the object will appear when seen through the coloured telescope of a prejudiced historian The most impartial may not always be successful in his delineations An intelligent reader frequently discovers  traits  which seem concealed He does not perceive these faint touches in the broad canvass of the historian but in those little portraits which have sometimes reached posterity He acquires more knowledge of indiviuals by memoirs than by histories In histories there is a majesty which keeps us distant from great men in memoirs  there is a familiarity which invites us to approach them In histories we appear only as one who joins the croud to see them pass in memoirs we are like concealed spies who pause on every little circumstance and note every little expression  It is thus that such works as Plutarch's Lives Froissart's Chronicle the Memoirs of Comines and Brantome Burnet's and Clarendon's Histories of their own Times have ever allured curiosity and gratified inquiry There are indeed readers who when they turn over the pages of history indulge in the marvellous of romance A visionary perfection darts from their imagination and throws around a brilliant delusion Their heroes are prince Arthurs their Heroines Unas their Statesmen Merlins It must be confessed that in the mode in which history is frequently composed there are sufficient reasons to render such a system plausible One can hardly meet with the most natural event in the histories of such writers as Tacitus of Strada and of Mariana but these refined writers are for deriving it from some profound policy or intricate deception In  their studious leisure it must have been with difficulty that they tortured their invention to such a stretch an impossibility in those personages who acted in the tumult of affairs and concussion of public events  Crebillon the son who sacrificed his talents on some licentious Romances in his Tanzai and Neadarne C has made a judicious reflection on readers of history I snatch this flower thrown among ordures He writes  'The reader of history passes his judgment on its heroes not so much from what they ought to have done in the circumstances in which they appear before him as from what he concludes they might have done He puts himself calmly and seriously in their place and divested of the passions which fired them clears or condemns them according to the success of their enterprizes but does not once enquire whether the circumstances would allow them time to deliberate or whether their impulses would permit them even to glance at reflection Among the various classes of readers very few examine incidents with judgment and most who have abilities for this are oftentimes very unjust'  I add a judicious observation of Patin on this subject  'The mysterious discovery of the designs of princes renders a history valuable but it must be founded on truth and not on the imagination of an historian who affects continually to make a new discovery'  The historian frequently seems ignorant of that haste in which the most splendid actions are performed and discovers a regular plot in the irregular combinations of fortune Every statesman who comes down to us as a Nestor I doubt was not the sage  we believe him to have been nor every general the Achilles he appears The most eminent personages are not so remotely removed from the level of ordinary humanity as the vulgar conceive Transcendant powers are rarely required tolerable abilities placed conspicuously appear to great advantage as a lighted torch held in the hand is too common an object to fix our attention but that torch placed favourably on a hill would excite our admiration Who is persuaded of this truth will be more inclined to search for the characters of eminent persons in their domestic privacies than in their public audiences and would prefer the artless recitals of the valet de chambre of Charles I to the elegant narrative of his apologist Hume  An anecdote reveals a character  A wellchosen anecdote frequently reveals a character more happily than an elaborate delineation as a glance of lightning will sometimes discover what had escaped us in a full light Some instances may enforce this observation  Anecdotes which discover the characters of eminent men  The character of Oliver Cromwell long exercised the historical talents of European writers Some French academicians have  drawn his character with admirable refinement Gregorio Leti amused with agreeable fictions Raguenet tires with dry truths at home volumes on volumes have wearied curiosity All these writers would persuade us that he was an artful mixture of the politician and the hypocrite A si  le anecdote leads us more into the genius of the man than this multiplicity of volumes When he is represented among some select friends in a convivial hour with a bottle in one hand and bending under the table to search for the corkscrew a confidential servant enters and announces a body of  'the Elect'    'Tell them'  says Cromwell in the language of fanaticism  'Tell them we are seeking for the LordThese fools think  he continues turning to his friends  'that I am seeking for the Lord while I am only seeking for the Corkscrew'  Does not this little anecdote at once present us with the artifices of his politics and the hypocrisy of his religion  The anecdote of the death of the gallant Sidney reveals with a marvellous force the genius of chivalry that genius which  was  valour  in the field and  love  at court The hand that lead through the graceful dance the beloved sovereign of his soul while he was bleeding to death could turn with a feeble yet energetic power the cruise of water from his pale and parched lips to those of his humble companion expiring at his feet  We are more acquainted with the character of Sir Thomas More by his jocularity on the scaffold than by some lives which are to be read of him  I shall close this topic with some anecdotical sketches of several monarchs who have formed epochas in the history of their nations  We are delighted to attend Augustus amidst the embarrassing affairs of government into his domestic recesses To see him the preceptor of his son to observe him at supper seated between Virgil and Horace and to mark him with exquisite wit erase one of his own tragedies Virgil was afflicted by an asthma and Horace by a fistula lachrymalis When Augustus was placed between them he used to say not unpoetically  'I am now between sighs  and tears'  This lover of the art aspired to become an artist he wrote a tragedy called Ajax but he had the good sense to perceive that if he was born to be an emperor he was not to be a poet One day he effaced with his sponge the whole tragedy when it was enquired after he wittily answered  'Ajax is dead he has swallowed his sponge'  alluding to a mode of death practised by the Roman gladiators who frequently in despair swallowed their sponges These little anecdotes shew the literary dispositions of Augustus whom perhaps as other great monarchs who resemble him a cruel system of politics alone had made a tyrant  I say politics alone compelled Augustus to sanguinary measures We know that he would never cause enquiries to be made after the authors of certain papers which had been scattered in the senate and which loaded him with calumnies When Tiberius wondered at his indifference this great monarch answered  'You think like a young man Let them speak ill of me it is sufficient for me that I know they can do me none'  Does this conduct of Augustus indicate him to have delighted in the effusion of human blood When he had attained power he shewed the most amiable disposition It is said of him in comparing the commencement of his reign with its close it had been desirable that he had never been emperor or that he had never ceased to be emperor Augustus is an eminent example of the force of the terrible genius of politics    Louis XIV merits the love of posterity  The genuis of his people not his own inspired him with attempts inimical to the rights of mankind When this monarch is deprived of that false glory which his adulators have thrown around him he will appear to advantage placed in the softer light of those hours which he devoted to the society of the great men whom his splendid patronage had formed Numerous anecdotes of this monarch are eternal testimonies of his intellectual powers and his fine taste He loved the conversations of Boileau and Racine He was not a mere auditor of their works he admired them with exquisite sensibility and animadverted on them with just criticism We know that he detected several errors in their works The eye that could catch a Boileau and a Racine tripping it must be confessed was of no ordinary quickness Several of these royal conversations have been recorded It is honourable for the satyrical bard that he had the boldness frequently to speak his sentiments freely and what is still more honourable his majesty did not dislike his frankness I give the reader one or two of those interesting anecdotes which relate to these two poets  It is well known that when Boileau read to his Majesty one of his epistles in which are these fine verses describing the Emperor Titus  'Qui rendit de son joug l'univers amoureux  'Qu'on n'alla jamais voir sans revenir heureux  'Qui soupiroit le soir si sa main fortunÃ©e  'N'avoit par ses bienfaits signalÃ© la journÃ©e'  his Majesty was enchanted and made the poet repeat them thrice At that moment perhaps he proposed Titus for his model such was the force of poetry The next day he gave orders for the war such was the power of politics When the satiric bard for the first time after the death of Racine paid his respects to the king Louis received him with affection He sympathised in the loss and he added in pulling out his watch  'Remember Boileau I have an hour for you every week'  I add one more anecdote which brings us into his apartment When the French Augustus was one day confined to his chamber he sent for Racine The poet read with grace and his Majesty asked him to take up some book A life of Plutarch was proposed  The king objected because of it's old French  'Will your Majesty permit me to try a life'  said Racine The king consented Our poet took down a volume of Amiot and turned his obsolete language into a beautiful style Louis was in raptures he rose and embraced the poet  It is with difficulty I can persuade myself that Charles I would have been a tyrant The Eikon Basilike which I consider as the memoirs of his heart abounds with such strokes of natural feeling and so powerfully excites our sympathy that we cannot easily conceive how a tyrant could have assumed such a character I give in the note some interesting passages from this work  'I cared not to lessen myself in some things of my wonted prerogative since I knew I could be no loser if I might but gain a recompens in my subjects affections'  p  'Popular tumults are not like a storm at sea which yet wants not it's terror but like an earthquake shaking the verie foundations of all then which nothing in the world hath more of horror'  p  '  More than the law gives me I would not have and less the meanest subject should not  '  p  'I will studie to satisfie my parliament and my people but I will  never for fear or slatterie gratifie anie faction  how  potent  soever for this were to nourish the disease and oppress the bodie'  p  'The sens of the injuries don unto my subjects is as sharp as those don to myselfMy afflictions griev mee not more then this doth that I am afflicted by those whose prosperitie I earnestly desire and whose seduction I heartily deploreYet I had rather suffer all the miseries of life and die many deaths then shamefully to desert or dishonourably to betrai my own just rights and sovereigntie'  p  'I know the sharp and necessarie tyrannie of my destroiers will sufficiently confute the calumnies of tyrannie against mee'  p  'It is verie strange that mariners can finde no other means to appeas the storm themselves have raised but by drowning their pilot'  p  The following anecdote which Mr Malone  reports from the memorandums of the Master of the Revels tends to prove that even in prosperity he would not suffer his people to be insulted by the language of despotism The following lines were in a manuscript play of Massinger  Monies We'ell raise supplies  what ways we please  And force you to subscribe to blanks in which  We'll mulct you as we shall think fit The Cesars  In Rome were wise acknowledging no laws  But what their  swords  did ratify  I cannot do better than transcribe the words of Sir Henry Herbert  'I have entered this here for ever to bee remembered by my son and those that cast their eyes on it in honour of king Charles my master  who readinge over the play at Newmarket  set his marke  upon the place with his owne hande and thes words  '  This is too insolent and to bee changed  '  This anecdote with others which might be given and the whole of the eloquent Eikon Basilike strongly indicate that the inclinations of Charles were remote from tyranny He was indeed firmly persuaded that a king had just powers of which it was as necessary to be careful as of the just rights of his people Such was his conviction that he preferred death to what he considered to be ignominy  I conclude this topic with an anecdote of the late unfortunate Louis XVI little known but which forcibly characterizes the dispositions of this monarch In a conversation on the subject of Rousseau's works he said that he wished it were possible to annihilate the Emilius on education because in that book the author attacks religion disturbs the security of society and the just subordination of citizens it can only tend to render men unhappyBut the social contract has also a most dangerous tendency observed a courtier  'As for that'  replied this most excellent prince in words which must not be forgotten  'it is very different It only attacks the authority of  sovereigns  that is  a subject proper to discuss  There is much to be said it is susceptible of controversy'  It is impossible to deny that this anecdote reveals the dispositions of the monarch It is curious to observe that Charles I lost his head because he was tenacious of his rights and Louis XVI because he was ever prompt to yield them to his subjects A striking testimony this of the mad ignorance of the multitude who know not either to govern others or themselves  Patin has made an admirable reflection on the caprices of that manyheaded monster the people These are his words  'Indeed the people know not what they would have nor what they should have  Plebs plerumque contra sua commoda certat  The people neither know or follow their interests They murmur against those who elevate themselves and they do not reflect that when these fall others will appear who will be still more desirous of doing the same thing or perhaps greater evils and who can only succeed but at the new cost of the people'    By anecdotes we become acquainted with human nature  If it is not too solemn a question for this light essay I ask in what manner is the knowledge of human nature acquired  Of some extraordinary minds it has been said that their knowledge is attained by that sublime conception which surveys at one glance the species and becomes as it were by intuition familiar with the individual A Shakespeare has certainly given the most forcible language and descriptions to characters and situations which never passed under his eye Such phenomena in nature we admire but who would imitate We gain our knowledge by the slow accession of multiplied facts these our reflection combines and thus combined they form what we call experience Rochefoucalt when with such energetic conciseness he composed his celebrated Maxims had ever some particular circumstance or some particular individual before him When he observed that  'It displays a great poverty of mind to have only one kind of genius'  he drew this reflection from repeated  anecdotes  which he had collected in the persons of Boileau and Racine  See Curiosities of Literature vol ii art  Poets  It was a very happy idea of Amelot de la Houssaie when he gave an edition of these admirable Maxims to illustrate several from  examples or anecdotes drawn from history If they were all thus illustrated by well collected authorities it would form not only a rich repast for amateurs of anecdotes but impress more forcibly the solid sense sometimes too closely compressed in these concise maxims  I will add an instance or two in what manner Houssaie has enforced some of these reflections  Rochefoucalt observes  'In jealousy there is less love than selflove'  Which reflection Houssaie illustrates by this anecdote taken from Tacitus  'Witness Rhadamistus who threw his beloved wife into a river that she might not fall into the hands of another'  The duke observes  'The art of setting off moderate qualifications steals esteem and often gives more reputation than real merit'  His commentator gives on this observation the following character from Tacitus  'Poppaeus Sabinus of moderate birth obtained the consulship and the honour of a triumph and governed for four and twenty years the greatest provinces without any extraordinary merit being just capable of his employments and in no manner above them'    The bulk of mankind indeed when facts present themselves to their contemplation are incapable of contemplating Ignorant of their utility they only regard them as objects of idle amusement Yet the science of human nature like the science of physics was never perfected till vague theory was rejected for certain experiment  An Addison and a Bruyere accompany their reflections by characters an anecdote in their hand informs us better than a whole essay of Seneca Opinions are fallible but not examples  A writer elegantly declaims against the vanity of a poet but when he judiciously gives a few of the innumerable instances of poetical vanity we shall comprehend him with more certainty and follow his reflections with the firm conviction of truth Would he inform us that innumerable little follies prevail in very great minds Every opinion is disputable We are persuaded of it's truth when he reminds us that Sir Robert Walpole a great minister was ambitious of being a man of gallantry and that another great minister Cardinal Richelieu was not less ambitious of being distinguished as a poet and that the one was as aukward in his compliments as the other in his verses In a word the wise Elizabeth was a coquette The ambitious Charles V terminated his career by watchmaking Racine believed himself to be a politician  When an author gives a character which strikes by it's singularity an anecdote will  serve to establish the veracity of its existence Thus the character of the astronomer in Rasselas so finely described by Johnson is a character founded in nature With a wonderful sublimity of genius this student is represented with an imbecillity little to be suspected that of believing himself invested with the power of regulating the seasons A similar character was this of Postel His Lectures were attended by such crouds that he was obliged to harangue his auditors at a window as the hall of the college at Paris was not sufficiently large to contain them yet this man otherwise so judicious cherished the extravagant folly of believing himself endowed with a supernatural reason He hoped to convert all the nations of the earth and had ever in his mind the idea of creating an order to be called the Knights of Christ and for this purpose associated himself with the jesuits who expelled him when they perceived his distempered imagination  We cannot therefore accumulate too great a number of such little facts I say facts otherwise we may err in our deductions as when one part of a sum is wrong the total amount must infallibly be so Facts  are anecdotes but anecdotes are not always facts  It is only the complaint of unreflecting minds that we collect too many anecdotes Why is human knowledge imperfect but because life does not allow of sufficient years to enable us to follow the infinity of nature The man of most experience still finds that he has new characters to understand old opinions to confirm and knowledge to correct as well as to acquire Human nature like a vast machine is not to be understood by looking on its superficies but by dwelling on its minute springs and little wheels Let us no more then be told that anecdotes are the little objects of a little mind  Anecdotes lead the mind into reflections  Anecdotes will be found to possess in some degree the perfection of instruction They produce in an ingenious observer those leading thoughts which throw the mind into an agreeable train of thinking A skilful writer of anecdotes gratifies by suffering us to make something that looks like a discovery of our own he gives a certain activity to the mind and the reflections appear to arise from ourselves He throws unperceivably seeds and we see those flowers start up which we believe to be of our own  creation A few pages of interesting anecdotes afford ample food for the mind  I quote the observation of a man of genius on this subject Lord Bolingbroke says  'When examples are pointed out to us there is a kind of appeal with which we are flattered made to our senses as well as our understandings The instruction comes then from our own authorities We yield to fact when we resist speculation'    If we regard anecdotes as they are connected with the republic of letters I do not hesitate to declare that they offer the most exquisite gratification  On Literary Anecdotes  In literary biography a man of genius always finds something which relates to himself In the history of his fellow students a writer traces the effects of similar studies he is warned by their failures or animated by their progress He discovers that like himself the sublimest geniuses have frequently stretched the bow without force and without skill He is not displeased to find that Pope composed an epic a tragedy and a comedy that the two first were burnt and the comedy damned La Mothe was so sensibly afflicted by the unfortunate fate of his first dramatic essay that he renounced the society of men and buried himself in the melancholy retreat of La Trappe  He perhaps considered that a condemned poet would make an excellent penitent  These instances and many similar ones of celebrated writers might be added I give not from any petty malignancy of criticism but with the intention of the writers of the holy Scriptures who report the failings of  Sain  s  that those of feebler powers may not want something to keep them from despair    Various anecdotes illustrating literary topics  From anecdotes a man of letters gathers the following particulars interesting to him  It is curious to observe the first dawn of genius breaking on the mind Sometimes a man of genius in his first effusions is so far from revealing his future powers that on the contrary no reasonable hope can be formed of his success In the violent struggle of his mind he may give a wrong direction to his talents as Swift in two pindaric odes which have been unfortunately preserved in his works Sometimes a man of genius displays no talents even among those who are able to decide on them his genius like Aeneas is veiled by a cloud and remains unperceived by his associates This was the case of Goldsmith who was so far from displaying a fine genius that even his literary companions before the publication of his beautiful poems regarded  him as a compiler for the Booksellers not as a writer for men of taste Sometimes when a writer displays an early genuis it is not expressed with all its force Several have began versifiers and concluded poets and perhaps this is no unjust idea of Pope  Is a man of genius oppressed with domestic miseries Does he tread on thorns while he cultivates flowers he ceases to feel his own griefs while he contemplates those of his masters On the misfortunes of the learned more than one volume has been composed  Pierius Valerianus has given a little book intitled  De infelicitate litteratorum  which he wrote from his own situation in which for many years he participated in the miseries he recorded of other scholars It was afterwards greatly enlargedA collection has been published at Leipsic in entitled  Analecta de calamitate litteratorum  Several other works on this subject have appeared  The domestic persecutions of a man of genius are more frequent and more formidable to his sensibility than those of a party or of the public Exquisite misery to feel the lacerations of the soul from the objects to which it turns for repose and delight An illiterate parent who harasses the mild dispositions of his  philosophic son and who counts with all the anxiety of the father and the merchant the hours he lavishes on his studies has been an ordinary misery of literary men The father of Petrarch one day in a barbarous rage burnt his small but invaluable library before his face and Voltaire with a thousand other writers have broken their fathers' heart by their constant application to poetry and utter neglect of the law  Hume says in the slight sketch he gives of his life  'My studious disposition my sobriety and my industry gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me but I found an insurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits of philosophy and general learning and while they fancied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was secretly devouring'  Young has described the character of such a parent as Descartes with his usual vigour of wit  Lampridius from the bottom of his breast  Sighs o'er one child but triumphs in the rest  How just his grief one carries in his head  A less proportion of the father's lead  The  dunghill breed  of men a diamond scorn  And feel a passion for a  grain of corn  Some stupid plodding moneyloving wight  Who wins their hearts by knowing black from white  Who with much pains exerting  all  his sense  Can range aright his shillings pounds and pence  The booby father craves a booby son  And by Heaven's blessing thinks himself undone  But  I hasten to conclude a list which perhaps is interminable Can we read without indignation that the family of the great Descartes were insensible to the lustre his studies reflected on their name They grievously lamented as a blot which could not be effaced from their arms that Descartes who was born a  gentleman  should become a  philosopher  This elevated genius was even denied the satisfaction of embracing his expiring parent while his dwarfish brother whose mind must have been as diminutive as his person ridiculed his philosophic relative and turned to advantage his philosophic dispositions The sublime Bacon generally sat at the end of his table in a state of abstraction while at the other his dependants cheated ridiculed and loaded him with infamous aspersions We must not look into the domestic recesses of men of genius if we would consider them as beloved or happy  The purpose of this Dissertation is an attempt however feeble to exhibit the utility and the delight of anecdote in the investigation of any topic I therefore shall  not wander from it if I sketch several subjects which relate to literary men and which shall consist of reflections illustrated by anecdotes  It has been said that Envy is only the offspring of little minds This has been repeated from age to age but it is one of those popular prejudices which are not the less false because they are of a remote date Of literary jealousy to select instances were difficult because of their abundance Why did Swift and Milton treat with contempt the rhimes of Dryden Why did Corneille tottering on the grave when Racine consulted him on his first tragedy advise the author never to write another Why does Voltaire continually detract from the sublimity of Corneille the sweetness of Racine and the fire of Crebillon Why was the admirable La Fontaine not even mentioned by the French Horace in all his works Why must posterity lament that the name of Young is to be found in the Dunciad of Pope Why did Boccaccio in sending to Petrarch a copy of Dante make an apology for it and why did the latter in his answer speak coldly of Dante's merits  The rigid virtue of Johnson could not save him from the meanest envy of Garrick nor the artless dispositions of Goldsmith from the corrosion of literary jealousy  It is difficult to repress our indignation at this envy of writers who should look for that support from each other which is sometimes unjustly denied them by the world In contemplating on this subject we are struck with the same horror as if we were to look into a nest of doves and behold vipers hissing at each other  We must feel another kind of indignation which falls not upon authors but their readers Men of genius have complained that their acquaintance are the last persons in the world whose affections they can win I collect several testimonies  When the voice of the public shall inform the friends of a man of genius how much he merits their affection they will be incapable of bestowing it A familiar acquaintance with an author observes Hume may diminish the applause due to his performance It was the eternal misery of Rousseau that his friends did not know how much he merited their affections On  this subject in the 'Thirty Letters' the acute writer  The ingenious Mr Jackson of Exeter whose literary attainments will perhaps one day be acknowledged not to be inferior to his musical powers  has judiciously observed that  'none judge less favourably of an author than his intimate friends their personal knowledge of him as a man destroys a hundred delusions to his advantage as an author'  Monnoye in a letter written when he first made his appearance as a writer has described the situation of a young author with sensibility and truth These are his words  'You know the town I inhabit one of the greatest faults a man can have it seems is a little merit a multitude of enemies is the certain fate of all those who appear desirous of distinguishing themselves You have read my poem on the abolishment of duels They said at first that it was good for nothing and after the Academy had crowned it they pretended that it was not written by me I have seen myself blackened by the grossest calumnies'  A French orator exclaims  'It is true that a superior genius finds himself sometimes  esteemed during his lifetime but he must generally seek for it at the distance of three hundred leagues'  I transcribe on this subject what the ingenious author of the Mirror writes perhaps prompted by his own feelings In mentioning the work he says  'The place of it's publication was in several respects disadvantageous There is a certain distance at which writings as well as men should be placed in order to command our attention and respect We do not easily allow a title to instruct or to amuse the public in our neighbour with whom we have been accustomed to compare our own abilities Hence the fastidiousness with which in a place so narrow as Edinburgh home productions are commonly received which if they are grave they are pronounced dull if pathetic are entitled unnatural if ludicrous are termed low'  So just is this last observation that I cannot forbear noticing that when Rousseau published at Neufchatel some little compositions they were not relished by his good provincial friends a few years afterwards they contributed to the literary pleasures of Paris It was  not the qualities of his writings that had changed but those of his readers  If the reader does not disrelish these anecdotical observations he will not be displeased with another specimen  Dr Joseph Warton who has employed anecdotes with such pleasing effect in his Essay on the Genius of Pope has given the following one of a celebrated poet  He writes  'So little sensible are we of our own imperfections that the very last time I saw Dr Young he was severely censuring and ridiculing the false pomp of fustian writers and the nauseousness of bombast'  I pursue this speculation interesting to literature  Of Seneca it is observed in the Perroniana that he himself writes against pointed periods and the epigrammatic style Lipsius was extravagantly fond of a certain concise style his epistles offend by a continued affection of this kind yet he not only censures brevity and declares it to produce a dry jejune mode of writing but minutely enters into it's numerous defects Cicero very warmly reprehends that abuse with  which the Greeks were accustomed to scatter their adversaries and who frequently passed from the censure of the work to satirizing the author himself But Cicero has left posterity no few specimens of the abusive style and the grossest personalities While Plato inveighs against poetry he proves himself a great poet It is thus Mallebranche declaims against the seductive charms of a fine imagination while he displays a most beautiful and deluding one Boccalini as Bayle observes makes Apollo give very judicious advice to an author who was hanged for too freely satirizing some noble families but our sage adviser himself lost his life for having written too freely concerning the Spanish court  I give the observation here alluded to He says that a judicious historian imitates the grapegatherer he waits till time has matured the harvest that is from speaking of facts till those who have committed dishonourable actions are no more and their children have not the power of avenging them  Marville gives the following account of the singular death of our satirist He says  'Boccalini was the author of La Pietra di Parrangone a satire against the Spaniards Too much wit and passion occasioned our author to be  sacchettato  that is he was so heartily beaten by the Spaniards that he died a few hours afterwards This is an invention of the Italians to murder a man without spilling his blood by beating him on the back with  bags of sand  The wounds these give are incurable a gangrene takes place and death concludes this mode of assassination'  This will serve as another instance of that inventive genius of assassination which once characterized the Italians and which has not entirely deserted their ordinary language as well as their passions    Burnet in the 'History of his own Times' which is almost as fabulous as Lucian's 'True History' is however and he was a bishop continually appealing to God and his conscience for the veracity of his work These are some of his expressions  'I solemnly say this to the world and make my humble appeal upon it to the great God of truth that I tell the truth on all occasions'    'I reckon a lie in history to be as much a greater sin than a lie in common discourse as the one is like to be more lasting and more generally known than the other'  Our bishop had immoderate prejudices and a lively imagination indulging these to an excess he left far behind him the sober truth of  'a faithful chronicler'  Mr Lesly who knew him familiarly has well described his character by saying  'He was zealous for the truth  but in telling it he always turned it into a lie  The following advice to the reader of Burnet's History forms an ingenious epigram I give the Latin original with its translation  Monitum lectori quomodo legenda sit Burnetti Historia sui Temporis et pro verÃ¢ admittenda  Leguntur Hebraeo verso ordine Literae  Cancrique serpunt in contrarium gradus  Tenella virgo si quem amat perditÃ©  Ea est proservitas fugit tanquam oderit  Quemque odit Aulicus tanta est urbanitas  Amore abundans quasi studiosus colit  Ut Hebraea legi cancros ut gradi vides  Tenella ut odit virgo amat ut Aulicus  HÃ¢c lege Lucianus historiam suam  Suamque Burnettus ipse veram dixerit  Attempted in English  Advice to the reader of Burnet's History of his own Time how it may be read and admitted for truth  The Hebrew characters are backward read  The crabfish backward crawls with aukward tread  The tender virgin scorch'd by Cupid's fires  Will seem to hate the man she most desires  The subtle courtier most obsequious waits  And most pretends to love whom most he hates  As Hebrew books are read as crabfish move  As virgins hate and as sly courtiers love  Just so may Lucian nay and Burnet too  Each boldly vouch their histories are true  We are astonished at the solemn appeals which our Bishop makes to Heaven for the veracity of his facts I suppose most readers imagine that he must have been sensible that he was only calling on Heaven to serve as a testimony to sanction lies This however to do as much justice as possible to the Bishop does not appear to me to be the case Burnet has been called the English Varillas and the character of the latter writer attacked by the learned of all nations and particularly in this country by the ingenious Dr King may serve to illustrate that of Burnet  Varillas has been accused of quoting memoirs which never existed or in which the facts he relates are not to be found It is however very true that Varillas had read an astonishing number of original memoirs The life of this man was consumed in his study and it was his boast that for thirty years he had not dined from home He had read so many manuscripts that his sight failed and he lost the use of one eye By candlelight he could not read and it was his custom to close his windows at dusk and then to  write  his Histories But as he could not authenticate his anecdotes by consulting the memoirs which had been furnished to him from the King's Library in which there is a collection from to Mss he trusted to his memory This naturally produced his confusion in facts what belonged to one kingdom was given to a neighbouring country what related to one person was transferred to another  It is therefore possible to suppose that neither Varillas nor Burnet intended to impose on the world But from these anecdotes we may inforce a very important maxim that an Historian must not write as  facts  what he only collects from  memory  he must authenticate his sources whatever they may be by correct citations If he does otherwise he is not to be trusted for however honest may be his intentions it is certain that he will not only impose on his reader but impose on himself Let it also be remembered that he who relies on his memory is frequently the dupe of his imagination  '  Cowley in his Ode to Wit has the following ingenious stanza which however is  but a splendid satire on his own witty poetry He says WIT is not  To adorn and gild each part  That shews more cost than art  Jewels at nose and lips but ill appear  Rather than all things wit let none be there  Several lights will not be seen  If there be nothing else between  Men doubt because they stand so thick i' th' sky  If those be stars which paint the Galaxy  It will not be denied that the indiscreet muse of Cowley wore jewels both at her nose and her lips  It is thus also that Dr Johnson in some admirable verses  Prologue spoken at the opening of the DruryLane Theatre in  censures those writers in whose plays  Crush'd by rules and weaken'd as refin'd  For years the power of Tragedy declin'd  From bard to bard the frigid caution crept  Till  Declamation roar'd  while  Passion slept  In the tragedy of Irene it must be acknowledged that  'declamation roars while passion sleeps'  In a word to conclude this topic I have observed a hundred French writers declaim against the abuse of what they so happily  call  le bel esprit  while they are themselves employing it in every perioda hundred English authors abusing the French writers while at the same time their work and their style are alike an imitation of them  If I were to make the following observation I would accompany it with the following anecdotes  A man of genius consumes one portion of his life in painful studies another in addressing his labours to the public and combating with his rivals in the last inconsiderable remnant of life he perhaps begins to enjoy that public esteem for which he had sacrificed the solid consolations of life his fortune his tranquillity in a word his domestic Lares Amidst the funereal cypress he sees the green leaves of the laurel He resembles a veteran soldier who should at the moment he is carried from the trenches in an expiring state receive the honours of promotion When he is once removed from the public and his rivals there is nothing they refuse him  Every little thing that belonged to this man  of genius becomes an invaluable relic The living Shakespeare experienced little of that adoration which has been repeatedly paid to him by posterity Little did he imagine that the  Mulberry Tree  which he planted supposing he did plant it would have been sought after with as much eagerness as a pious Catholic shews for a piece of the real cross Thomson never imagined that his  old chair  In a festival in honour of the Poet of the Seasons the chair in which it is supposed he composed part of his Seasons was produced and communicated a poetic rapture to the admirers of the Muse assembled for this occasion Even honest Aubrey can admire the  chair  of a man of genius Our antiquary says of Ben Jonson in the curious manuscript which Mr Malone has given in his account of the English Stage I  'have seen his studyeing chaire which was of strawe such as old women used and as Aulus Gellius is drawn in'  Aubrey should himself have had such  'a studyeing chaire'  for he was  'an old woman'  would have been beheld with the eyes of adoration by his countrymen Rabelais among all his drollest imaginations never conceived that his  cloak  would be preserved in the university of Montpellier that those who are received as doctors should wear it on the day they take their degree  Such is the public long misled by the  malice of rivals their decisions are capricious irresolute and unjust Posterity while it censures the past age commits the same injustice to its cotemporaries It exhausts its admiration on an old tree an old chair and an old cloak while the modern Shakespeares Thomsons and Rabelais if there should be any would pass unobserved by its injudicious applause  I shall add one more sketch of a literary topic  Men of genius catch inspiration from that of others Their mind is not always prepared to pour forth its burning ideas it is kindled by the flame which it strikes from the collision of the works of great writers It was thus that Cicero informs us that he animated his eloquence by a constant perusal of the poetry of the Latins and Greeks Poets awaken their imagination by the verses of other poets Malherbe Corneille and Racine before they applied themselves to composition put their mind into its proper tone by repeating the glowing passages of their favourite poets The most fervid verses of Homer and the sweetest of  Euripides enriched the memory of Milton  'Milton'  says Richardson  'had read and studied all the greatest Poets and had made all his own Homer he could almost repeat without book'  It is related of Bossuet that before he composed a funeral oration he was accustomed to withdraw for four or five days into his study and read Homer When he was asked the reason of this practice he expressed himself in these verses  Magnam mihi mentem animumque  Delius inspirat vates  Marville says that the famous orators in the pulpit and at the bar of his time used to read the finest passages of the poets to germinate those seeds of eloquence which nature had scattered in their souls It was thus also that a celebrated preacher boldly copied Seneca the tragedian in the violent passions he assumed and one less ardent but more tender interwove in his sermons pieces taken from Ovid One pleader would only breathe the fury of Juvenal another displayed the graceful turns which he had borrowed from Horace  Collections of anecdotes serve as an excellent substitute for the conversations of eminent writers  We now turn to the consideration of those literary collections which give the anecdotes and conversations of celebrated men  The conversations of scholars have been collected in ages of literature That they have not been formed with that care and that selection they merited has been the only cause of their having fallen into disrepute With such substitutes we are enabled in no ordinary degree to realise the society of those who are no more and to become more real cotemporaries with the great men of another age than were even their cotemporaries themselves  Are we not all desirous of joining the society of eminent men It is a wish of even the illiterate But the sensibility of genius shrinks tremblingly from the contact of the vulgar and the arrogance of learning will not descend to their level They prefer a contemplative silence rather than incur the chance of being insulted by their admiration  Few therefore can be admitted to their conversations Yet when a man of genius displays conversible talents his conversations are frequently more animated more versatile  and I must add more genuine than his compositions Such literary conversations may be compared to waters which flow from their source but literary writings resemble more frequently an ornamented fountain whose waters are forced to elevate themselves in artificial irregularities and sparkling tortuosities  These collections are productive of utility A man of letters learns from a little conversation which has been fortuitously preserved a casual hint which was gathered as it fell and an observation which its author might never have an occasion to insert in his works numberless mysteries in the art of literary composition and those minute circumstances which familiarize us to the genius of one whom we admire and whom sometimes we aspire to imitate  Observations on the delight of literary history  Literary history has indeed been pursued with a passionate fondness by our first scholars I will not wander from home on this occasion though our neighbours far surpass us in this pleasing species of erudition Dr Johnson has said  'It was what he most loved'  It is curious to observe that he begins his Biography of our Poets  by a complaint of  'the penury of English biography'  It is the regret of one who felt all it's charms and who perhaps lamented that he could not much improve its miserable fund Dr Warburton has called literary history  'the most agreeable subject in the world'  Dr Warton in his Essay on the Genius of Pope has presented us with an admirable specimen in what manner literary anecdote may be introduced for the illustration of an author and delight of the reader Pelisson in his History of the French Academy has made an observation on literary history which will find an echo in the bosom of every man of letters He writes  'Had we any particulars remaining of what passed between Augustus Mecenas and the celebrated wits of their age I know not whether we should read this history with less curiosity and delight than that of the wars and affairs of the government of those times Perhaps to say something more we should not read it with less utility and instruction we I say to whom Fortune has given nor armies to conduct nor politics to govern but to whom she has  only bequeathed study conversation and the domestic virtues'  Literary anecdotes carry with them so powerful an attraction that we consult with pleasure the Athenae Oxonienses of Anthony Wood though composed in a hard dry and repulsive style Another work of a congenial cast is Hawkins's Life of Johnson whose genius revived that of the sour Wood Mr Nichols in his Life of Bowyer has made a most valuable accession of cotemporary anecdote perhaps a happier arrangement and a more copious criticism are desireable Mr Boswell in his Life of Johnson has exquisitely gratified the amateur of literary anecdotes To compare it with Monnoye's edition of the Menagiana would not be doing justice to this work which is almost as singular in it's nature as it's merit It is with pleasure that I perceive of late that several writers of taste have not considered it as beneath their powers to become commentators Mr T Warton Mr Steevens Mr Malone and Dr Farmer stand eminently distinguished in this class of literature which has hitherto been assigned to writers of low talents  These critics have felt all the charms of literary history and their curious researches interest us much more by the pleasure we feel in their perusal than by that recondite erudition in English literature which they so admirably display  Pope whose criticism is almost ever unerring miserably failed when he satirized those who applied to the forgotten volumes of our old authors to elucidate the writings and manners of another age Attached to the classics of Greece and Rome he perhaps did not recollect that there is a time in the literature of every polished nation when it has classics of it's own There is a bigotry in literature as well as in religion So ignorant was Pope of our old English writers that he lamented he had not been acquainted with the satires of Bishop Hall when he devoted his muse to satirical composition How many other authors are there on whose soil his industry would have gleaned many a rich sheaf Had he known more of these writers he would have hardly ventured to commit depredations on Milton  We are not therefore any more to be told of  'All such reading as was never read'  The great critic after he gave this sarcastic observation amply confuted himself by his own edition of Shakespeare  I transcribe the judicious opinion which Mr Warton has made in his observations on Spenser He says  'In criticising upon Milton Jonson and Spenser and some other of our elder poets not only a competent knowledge of all ancient classical learning is requisite but also an acquaintance with those books which though now forgotten and lost were yet in repute about the time in which each author respectively wrote and which it is most likely he had read'    Literary biography cannot be accomplished without a copious use of anecdote  Without the use of literary anecdote it is in vain to attempt literary biography  A biographer should be more solicitous of displaying the genius of the man whose history he writes than his own He should not obtrude his own talents on the eye so much as those of the person whose life he records Some have written the life of another merely to shew that they were themselves fine writers  When Richardson the father gave the life of Milton he did not compose it in the ordinary style of biographers If we take away some of his excentricities his manner is admirable It is very possible to write the life of a poet a lord chancellor and a general almost in a similar style  It was said of Mallet after he had given the life of Bacon and who pretended to be employed on that of Marlborough that as he had forgotten that Verulam had been a philosopher he would probably forget that Marlborough had been a general He did better He took Â£ for his Life and never wrote a page of it By the way this has been no uncommon practice among authors Some have published a variety of titles of works as if they were ready for the press but of which the titles only had been written Pafchal who was historiographer to Francis I forged such titles that the pension which he received for occupying himself on the French history might be continued When he died all his historical performances did not exceed six pages  What  is the consequence of such idle biography With much trouble we find at length that the genius of either remains yet to be known One poet is made to resemble another and what is worse a poet resembles a lord chancellor Richardson a Miltonic enthusiast was best qualified to give the biography of Milton an enthusiast He did not remain satisfied with collecting the information which industrious enquiry produced but he studied to give the character of Milton from his own descriptions He connected with an ardour of research for which posterity should be grateful from all his works in verse and in prose the minute circumstances and peculiar sentiments which our sublime poet had recorded of himself  In reading this sketch of the manners and the genius of Milton we seem to live with him we participate in the momentary griefs which afflicted him and the momentary triumphs in which he exulted We join the old blind bard at the door of his house near Bunhillfields  Most of the following particulars are given in the lively expressions of Richardson  we see him sit there in a grey coarse cloth coat in the  warm sunny weather breathing the fresh air His house is indeed small and what true poet ever possessed a large one It has but one room on a floor Up one pair of stairs hung in rusty green sits John Milton in an elbow chair in black clothes yet neat enough Pale but not cadaverous his hands gouty  And what does Milton say on his blindness when his enemies reproach him with it as a crime These are his words taken from his second defence of the English nation  'I prefer my blindness to your's'  he addresses his adversaries  'your's is sunk into your deepest senses blinding your minds so that you can see nothing that is sound and solid Mine takes from me only the colour and surface of things but does not take away from the mind's contemplation what is in those things of true and constant Moreover how many things are there which I would not see How many which I can be debarred the sight without repining How few left which I much desire to see Vile men who mock us The blind have a protection from the injuries of men and we are rendered almost  sacred To this I impute that my friends are more ready and officious to serve me than before and more frequently visit me They do not think that the only worth of an honest man is placed in his eyes'  Richardson would have considered himself as fortunate had he been enabled to add another lively scene to the domestic life of Milton This has been obtained by the late laureat who in his second edition of his juvenile poems has given the nuncupative will of our poet I gather from a mass of the barren superfluities of legal information those interesting strokes with which every man of sensibility and taste will sympathize We must recollect that at the period to which they relate Milton was no more the secretary of the commonwealth and his friends were destroyed or dispersed These little facts describe more forcibly than the most eloquent declamation those secret miseries which preyed on the heart of Milton and which must not only have disturbed his sublime contemplations but impeded the vigour of his fancy and the corrections of his criticism  It is here we learn that his children combined to cheat and to rob him to embitter  his hours with scorn and disaffection and far from solacing the age of their venerable their sublime parent they became impatient of his death He had  'No fond companion of his helpless years'  GOLDSMITH  The name of Milton must be added to the melancholy catalogue of the unhappy learned Behold the great Milton blind decrepid poor and solitary for solitary he must then have been amidst those who now surrounded him seated by a little fire in his kitchen crying to his wife with a voice of patient grief  'Make much of me as long as I live'  When his meat is brought to him because it is made agreeable to his taste for he was delicate though temperate he exclaims with grateful pleasure to his wife  'God have mercy Betty I see thou wilt perform according to thy promise in providing me such dishes as I think fit whilst I live'  Such is our own domestic language and such was the domestic language of the sublimest genius Genius is not above the little consolations of humanity  Let me reflect a moment on the scene that occupies my imagination Men of  genius the reflection is addressed to you Milton had perhaps wandered in the fields of fancy and consoled his blindness with listening to the voice of his nation that was to have resounded with his name To Virgil and Tasso and Ariosto not his masters but his rivals their country had not been ungrateful One had basked in the sunshine of a court the other had seen the laurel wreath prepared for him at Rome and the last lived to hear his name repeated in the streets and saluted as the poet of his nation Milton had enriched his national poetry with two epicswhat were his rewards Milton considered himself as fortunate in having one female who did not entirely abandon him and one obscure fanatic who was pleased with his poems because they were religious What laurels What felicities  Je lis les noms des poÃ«tes fameux  Ou sont les noms des poÃ«tes heureux  GRESSET  Anecdotes considered as a source of literary amusement superior to romances  On anecdotes judiciously arranged another observation is to be made  Men of letters to unbend from their feverer studies have frequently had recourse  to the works of mere imagination Romances have been admitted into their libraries they fly  from serious Antonine  To Rabelais' ravings and from prose to verse  ARMSTRONG  To folace mental fatigue by the amusements of fancy is no loss of time Students know how often the eye is busied in wandering over the page while the mind lies in torpid inactivity they therefore compute their time not by the hours consumed in study but by the real acquisitions they obtain they do not number the voyages they make but the gold and the diamonds they bring home A man of letters best feels the truth of the maxim of Hesiod when applied to time that  'Half is better than the whole'  But it is a complaint of ingenious minds that when they deviate into the gardens of Armida they want the fortitude of Rogero to exile themselves from their enchantments Yet works of amusement must relieve those of learning If a student values his hours it is therefore as dangerous for him to read romances as it would be not to read them  It is perhaps more desireable to have such literary collections at hand Anecdotes gratify the ease of indolence by their conciseness and the love of novelty by that infinite variety which they present to the mind Perhaps the interest they excite is superior to that we feel in a work of imagination It must be felt so at least by the enthusiastic votary who approaches his masters with anxiety with curiosity with admiration  What painter but must receive an exquisite gratification in this anecdote of Poussin  'I saw Poussin says Marville during my residence at Rome I have frequently admired the excessive love this excellent painter had for the perfection of his art Old as he then was I have met him among the ruins of ancient Rome and sometimes in the country and on the borders of the Tiber sketching whatever he remarked the most to his taste I have seen him frequently return with his handkerchief full of stones moss flowers and similar objects which he was desirous of painting exactly after nature I asked him one day by what means he had attained  that high excellence which had placed him so eminently among the Italian painters he answered modestly  I have neglected nothing  '  And what poet is not interested in this literary anecdote of a kindred nature which Johnson has recorded of Pope I do not venture to change his expressions  'From his attention to poetry he was never diverted If conversation offered any thing that could be improved he committed it to paper If a thought or perhaps an expression more happy than was common rose to his mind he was careful to write it an independant distich was preserved for an opportunity of insertion and some little fragments have been found containing lines or parts of lines to be wrought upon at some other time'  From these anecdotes I conclude that a student must be more interested in what relates to a Poussin and a Pope than to a Sir Charles Grandison and a Tom Jones Such notices as the above relating to illustrious characters are so many incidents in the voluminous romance of life and when such names are mentioned they are sufficient to  excite that anxious curiosity which is the perfection of fiction Instead of one hero we have thus a thousand in whose cause we equally participate  Let us also reflect that though such anecdotes form a source of literary amusement they convey at the same time some of it's most valuable instructions We learn from these anecdotes of Poussin and of Pope that a painter must bring home moss and flowers and a poet sentiments and images There is nothing so minute that may be neglected nothing so vast but which may escape we must therefore habituate our mind to studious attention as much out of our cabinet as in it The painter does not always require his easel to paint nor the poet his poem to compose their genius accompanies them in their walks and in their conversations  Another reflection offers itself to my mind  The  nstructions which an artist may  rive from anecdotes  The studies of artists have a great uniformity They have all the same difficulties to encounter though they do not all meet the same glory It is also certain that several men of genius have seen their labours  neglected for their deficiency in that art of finishing which is the excellence of art An artist has many artifices to employ of which if he is ignorant he will never attain that rank which he otherwise would merit It is not probable that the zeal of his friends nor even the malice of his critics will be capable of discovering to him those mysteries of which he is ignorant or those failings which render his attempts fruitless Such arts of composition are alone to be attained by patient meditation on his own and on the labours of others It will be impossible for him to turn over a series of anecdotes skilfully arranged and enlightened by reflections but he will gain some valuable intelligence which relates to his own studies From one he learns in what manner he corrected and he planned from another in what manner he overcame those obstacles which perhaps at that very moment obstructed his progress and made him rise in despair from his own unfinished labour What perhaps he had in vain desired for half his life is revealed to him by an anecdote It is thus that the recreations of indolence may impart the vigour of  study as we find sometimes in the fruit we took for pleasure the medicine that restores our health  Anecdotes of various use to writers  It is necessary that the mind of a writer should be richly stored with anecdotes of all kinds The most unconnected anecdote may be advantageously employed Anecdotes will serve to enliven his writings by a pleasing diversity to strengthen his opinions by a happy illustration and they will afford him a fund of ingenious allusions I have given sufficient examples of the first kinds I add one of the latter In N  o  of the Rambler that great moralist thus expresses himself  'A Virginian king when the Europeans had fixed a lock on his door was so delighted to find his subjects admitted or excluded with such facility that it was from morning to evening his whole employment to turn the key We among whom locks and keys have been longer in use are inclined to laugh at this American amusement yet I doubt whether this paper will have a single reader that may not apply this story to himself and recollect some hours of his life in which he has been equally overpowered by the transitory  charms of trifling novelty'  By this anecdote of the Virginian king we may perceive in what manner the ingenuity of a writer may employ for the happiest application the most trifling and unconnected anecdote  To return to the subject of anecdotes relating to literary men There are some who appear born with an antipathy to anecdotes They exclaim  'Give me no anecdotes of an author but give me his works'  This contempt is erroneous and prejudicial to literature  Anecdotes of an author serve as comments on his works  One likes to know the history and the occasion of a work and above all the character of an author It is certain that these little circumstances serve greatly to lead us into his genius and the proper understanding of many passages This is very necessary in political writings in memoirs and such as are entitled histories of our own time We of all other nations abound with party writers and it is sometimes even necessary not only to know the  character  of an  author  but the very  date  of his  publications  Every true Briton is doubtless a disinterested patriot yet he rarely appears insensible to the  offer or the refusal of a pension our politics are as various as our atmosphere They are divided too into as many sects as our religion The bigotry of toryism is seen sometimes to terminate in the atheism of whiggism An Englishman is for saving his soul and the nation in the way that he likes best  Anecdotes of historical writers very necessary for the reader of their works  It is therefore very useful to have anecdotes of such writers When we read Parker's History of his own Time we cease to be surprised at seeing the celebrated Marvell treated as an outcast of society an infamous libeller and one whose talents were as despicable as his person We know that this description was dictated not only by the hatred of party but by that of personal rancour When we read Froissart we must not be misled by his apparent simplicity and captivating naivetÃ© we must remember that he lived in our country an adulator of Queen Philippa and the English court When we read Comines it will not be improper to recollect this anecdote  Amelot de la Houssaie's MÃ©moires  the volume  This writer had been born a subject and had been  a favourite of the Duke of Burgundy  Returning from the chace he one day sat down before his prince and jocosely ordered him to pull off his boots It is not less unjust than dangerous to amuse one's self with a prince The duke pulled off his boots and dashed them in Comines' face which bled freely From that time he was mortified at the court of Burgundy by the nickname of  the booted head  Comines felt the wound in his mind He soon afterwards went over to the king of France It was at that court he composed his Memoirs in which his old patron the Duke of Burgundy is represented a  a monster of pride of tyranny and cruelty I am afraid that if we closely examine into the anecdotes of the writers of memoirs we shall find that many like Comines have had the boot dashed in their face  I shall not dismiss this topic without seizing the opportunity it affords of disclosing to the public an anecdote which should not have been hitherto concealed from it When some historians meet with any information in favour of those personages whom they have chosen to execrate as it were systematically they employ forgeries interpolations  or still more effectual villainies Mrs Macaulay when she consulted the Mss at the British Museum was accustomed in her historical researches when she came to any passage unfavourable to her party or in favour of the Stuarts to  destroy the page  of the Ms These dilapidations were at length perceived and she was watched The Harleian Ms will go down to posterity as an eternal testimony of her historical impartiality It is a collection of state letters This Ms has three pages entirely torn out and it has a note signed by the principal librarian that on such a day the Ms was delivered to her and the same day the pages were found to be  destroyed  Addison's observation on anecdotes illustrated  There is not less serious truth than exquisite humour in the wellknown observation with which Addison opens his Spectators He says  'I have observed that a reader seldom peruses a book with pleasure until he knows whether the writer of it be a black or a fair man of a mild or choleric disposition with other particulars of the like nature that conduce very much to the right understanding of an author'  I confess I shall read the works of the  three great Italian writers Dante Petrarch and Boccacio with a more refined delight since I have become acquainted with their portraits elaborately drawn by Tiraboschi  See his copious History of Italian Literature  From this excellent writer I am informed that Dante was much given to musing and inclined to melancholy that he had something like pride in his nature silent in ordinary company but when he spoke every word was deeply thought His conversation was as satirical concerning those he did not esteem as it was grateful to his friends and patrons Such was the poet of the sombrous and satiric Inferno  He who is the model of tender sonnets and the poet of the Loves and the Graces was beautiful in his person enchanting in his conversation while his eloquence enraptured his delighted auditors He knew to vary his employments to fly from the court into the depth of solitude  Zimmerman gives another turn to this continual change of place He says in his Solitude  'Petrarch possessed a restless and unquiet mind displeased because he was not where he could not go because he could not attain every thing he wished because he looked in vain for something it was impossible he should find Petrarch in short possessed all those defects which generally accompany men of genius'  When we consider that he proposed to reside at Venice and made even a present of his library to the republic yet could not remain there above two years with other similar resolutions which were broken almost as soon as formed one must prefer this opinion of Zimmerman to Tiraboschi so difficult is it however to fix on the truth  and it was thus that this amiable genius became as learned as he was accomplished  The licentious writer of the most agreeable prose in Italian literature had neither the sublime melancholy of Dante nor the enchanting politeness of Petrarch In the travels which in his youthful years he made in the character of a merchant he had acquired his variety of knowledge of human nature and a decided taste for that freedom of gaiety which does not always spare the blushes of the modest and the tremors of the pious Love good eating and polite literature were his divinities He was big and corpulent an able drinker an excellent companion and an adorer of the ladies The priests at length frightened poor Boccacio as they afterwards did his happy disciple La Fontaine Boccacio suddenly became reserved solitary and melancholy his studies  partook of his dispositions for after his conversion Tiraboschi says he produced nothing that we can read One is inclined to lament that he became religious  It is not amiss when one reads the misanthropic works of Hobbes to recollect that the philosopher of Malmesbury wrote many of them in a manner which perhaps has rendered them so rugged We are told that soon after dinner he would retire into his study and have his candle with ten or twelve pipes placed by him then shutting the door he began smoaking thinking and writing From a man who would smoke at his writings ten pipes it was but natural they should retain something of the dull effluvia of the tobacco Such an one might be a philosophic politician but not a poetic philanthropist  Yet let it not be considered that however sensible I may appear to the charms of striking anecdotes I do not perceive that frequently they are frivolous insipid and inconsequential Many collectors of anecdotes have shewn by their inability that some talents are requisite to render them valuable some taste in their selection  some judgment in their arrangement and some elegance in their style  A writer of talents sees relations in anecdotes not perceived by others  A man of penetration sees relations in anecdotes which are not immediately perceived by others in his hands anecdotes even should they be familiar to us are made susceptible of a thousand novel turns We have only to examine the Eloges of the French academicians composed by Fontenelle and D'Alembert to perceive in what manner literary anecdotes should be presented and to most of our writers to see how they should not be given  A model of anecdotical composition  As the design of this Essay is to shew in what manner any topic may be enforced or illustrated by anecdotes rather than the manner in which any single anecdote may be given I prefer to offer as a model of this species of anecdotical composition some parts of the Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting by Du Bos This work is familiarly known to and ardently cherished by every man of taste so that I shall not venture to dwell longer on it than is necessary to communicate my idea When this ingenious reflector would establish the observation  that  'the impulse of genius determines those who were born with it to become a painter or poet'  he shews by a series of connected anecdotes that most of the celebrated artists were never born the sons of painters  Raphael observes Du Bos is the only exception  As for poets they are still a more striking testimony of this impulse of genius No father ever yet designed his son to assume the profession of a poet We cannot doubt of the truth of these observations when we read that variety of anecdotes which he has united with such taste and which establish the great principle of the impulse of genius There are other sections in this delightful work which charm and instruct us by the happy manner in which he has interwoven among his reflections a series of interesting anecdotes  Of frivolous anecdotes  I hasten now to conclude this Essay by noticing when anecdotes become frivolous and impertinent given by writers destitute of talents  Dr Johnson who has devoted one of his periodical papers to a defence of anecdotes some part of which has been properly quoted by Mr Boswell expresses himself  thus on certain collectors of anecdotes  'They are not always so happy as to select the most important I know not well what advantage posterity can receive from the only circumstance by which Tickell has distinguished  Addison  from the rest of mankind the  irregularity of his pulse  nor can I think myself overpaid for the time spent in reading the life of  Malherbe  by being enabled to relate after the learned biographer that Malherbe had two predominant opinions one that the looseness of a single woman might destroy all her boast of ancient descent the other that the French beggars made use very improperly and barbarously of the phrase  noble gentleman  because either word included the sense of both'  These just observations may perhaps be further illustrated by the following notices An admirable writer of anecdotes whom I shall not name on this occasion has informed the world that  many of our poets have been handsome  This certainly neither concerns the world nor their poetry It is trifling to tell us that Dr Johnson was accustomed  '  to cut his nails to the quick  '  It is perhaps venial  because Mr Boswell who gives this intelligence must feel an interest in the minutest circumstance which related to him I am not much gratified by being informed that Menage wore  a greater number of stockings  than any other person excepting one whose name I have really forgotten The biographer of Cujas a celebrated lawyer says that  two things  were  remarkable  of this  scholar  The  first  that he studied on the floor lying on his belly on a carpet with his books about him and  secondly  that his perspiration exhaled an agreeable smell which he used to inform his friends he had in common with Alexander the Great This admirable biographer should have told us if he frequently turned from his very uneasy attitude Somebody informs us that Guy Patin resembled Cicero whose statue is preserved at Rome on which he enters into a comparison of Patin with Cicero He should have recollected that he might have resembled the  statue  of Cicero but not Cicero himself Baillet loads his life of Descartes with a thousand minutiae which less disgrace the philosopher than the  biographer Was it worth while informing the public that Descartes was very particular about his wigs that he had them manufactured at Paris and that he always kept four That he wore green taffety in France but that in Holland he quitted taffety for cloth and that he was fond of omelets of eggs There are writers who cannot distinguish between such frivolous particulars and those anecdotes which convey some striking sentiment characteristic of a sublime genius It must also be confessed that there are readers who when they meet with interesting anecdotes of illustrious men rank them with such frivolous particulars  Trifling anecdotes sometimes to be excused  Yet of anecdotes which appear trifling something may be alledged in their defence It is certainly safest for  some  writers to give us all they know than to permit themselves the power of rejection because for this there requires a certain degree of taste and discernment which many biographers are not so fortunate as to possess Let us sometimes recollect that the page over which we toil will probably furnish materials for authors of happier talents I would rather  have a Birch or a Hawkins appear heavy cold and prolix than that any thing which concerns a Tillotson or a Johnson should be lost It must also be confessed that an anecdote or a circumstance which may appear inconsequential to a reader may bear some remote or latent connection which a mature reflection often discovers It is certain that a biographer who has long contemplated the character he records sees many relations which escape an ordinary reader On this subject I shall quote the judicious observation of Dr Kippis a writer to whom English literature owes much and whose life is precious to every man of letters Our biographer in closing the life of Dr Birch has formed an apology for that minute research which it is said this writer has carried to a blameable excess He writes  'It may be alledged in our author's favour that a man who has a deep and extensive acquaintance with a subject often sees a connection and importance in some smaller circumstances which may not immediately be discerned by others and on that account may have reasons for inserting  them that will escape the notice of superficial minds  AbbÃ© d'Olivet has been censured for dwelling in his Continuation of the History of the French Academy on minute circumstances unworthy of the dignity of the historian Perhaps it was unfortunate for our abbÃ© that his predecessor Fontenelle so eminently distinguished himself in the same career In a letter which he wrote some time after his work was published he gives his opinion on these minutiae of literary history He says  'For my part I should be charmed if we had a good life of Homer of Plato of Horace of Virgil and their equals It is in these cases the minutest details would not fail to interest me but I would not give a straw to know the year of Rome in which Bavius was born who were his father his mother his nurse and his preceptor the number of his brothers and sisters nor the year and the day in which he died'  I must confess in closing this note that a warm admirer of any great man never finds any thing uninteresting which relates to him but some biographers do not recollect that the lives they record are not always those which enjoy this privilege  '  Character of a writer of anecdotes  I shall now close this Dissertation by attempting to sketch the character of a writer of anecdotes  To collect anecdotes is the humble labour of industry but not to present them with reflection with acumen and with taste  It is a task not unworthy of genius to arrange these minute notices of human nature  and of human learning A writer might yet delight us by a collection of topics which should illustrate manners history and literature his talents must be versatile yet powerful A writer of anecdotes has difficulties to encounter from which the biographer is exempt A biographer has but the peculiarities of an individual to seize he has only to assimilate his genius to that of another person He plays but with one ball and practice will teach his hand to grasp it with adroitness a writer of anecdotes throws with several It becomes necessary for such an one to render himself familiar with the multiform shapes of nature herself Is such a writer to give anecdotes of a Gray a Milton or a Sterne his soul must be softened with the querulous melancholy of Gray austere with the republican fierceness of Milton and varied with the gaiety and the pathos of Sterne Anecdotes are but squalid skeletons unless they are full of the blood and flesh of reflection If our writer does not feel with the sensibility of taste his reflections may be just but trivial his style must be diversified by the variety of passion he must  know to mourn and to rejoice Does he present the anecdotes of war of persecution of superstitionhis periods must assume a higher tone his sentiments must overflow his facts and his heart must be more occupied than his memory Does he give the anecdotes of conviviality of wit and of criticismhis style must be sharp with epigrammatic pungency or embellished with a thousand graces  This art is what has been so justly admired in Fontenelle's  Eloges  of the Academicians Every one is treated in a style conformable to the object in which he excelled The genius of Fontenelle discloses that of an astronomer a physician a moralist a geometrician and a poet as if either of these professions had formed the studies of his life  He is no inferior artist who must occasionally alarm with the terrifying sublimity of an Angelo or enchant with the softened beauty of an Albano  A writer of anecdotes should write of eminent characters as they would themselves have written of others He must therefore possess a portion of that genius which he records  If I have not raised the character of such an author to an unnecessary and imaginary perfection our writers of anecdotes have yet an excellence to attain  That cannot be imaginary which has been already effected nor unnecessary which adds new gratifications to a refined taste I have already mentioned as models in the art of anecdotical composition the illustrious names of Fontenelle D'Alembert and Du Bos I have been compelled on this occasion to cite the literature of a rival nation Yet if our writers of anecdotes could unite the various learning of Dr Warton to his fine taste his exact judgment and his exquisite art of introducing anecdote we perhaps might have writers who were worthy of being classed in the rank of the Fontenelles  FINIS  Lately Published  An improved Edition considerably
