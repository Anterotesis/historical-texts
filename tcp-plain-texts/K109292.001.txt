PROPRIETY and ELEGANCE  In TWO VOLUMES VOL I  LONDON Printed for J DODSLEY in  Pallmall  MDCCLXVI  To the Right Honourable PHILIP Earl STANHOPE Viscount MAHON F R S  SIR  TO whom could a work of this kind which is a disquisition of what others have spent a whole life without the least attention to be inscribed with any seeming propriety if not to a gentleman who has himself passed years in the researches of literature but setting aside its propriety on this account the obligations you and your lordship's family have  been pleased to confer on me and mine are sufficient to engross my continual respect and claim every acknowledgement in my power to make accept then Sir this public testimony of it and be assured the dedicating this work to your lordship proceeds more from an ambition of being thought one of your many admirers than from any view of profiting by your lordship's patronage  Believe me Sir with the profoundest respect  Your Lordship's most obliged and most obedient humble servant THE AUTHOR  LONDON  May  A TRANSLATION OF Abbé GIRARD's PREFACE  IF society be formed by the communication of ideas and sentiments speech is undoubtedly its most essential and most graceful band being at once the pencil of the mind the image of its operations and the interpreter of the heart The more we go  abroad among men the more we perceive that language is the true seasoning of every delight When all things else fail or when through age we have no other enjoyment that of conversation will furnish amusement in our latter hours and will at that time grow more and more satisfactory as it will in some measure make up for the want of those pleasures we are incapable of receiving In all times and on all occasions speech is delightful there can be no true happiness without the joys of the mind no good fortune that we do not long to make known no secret we do not wish to communicate no tender sentiment we are not anxious to declare no system we do not thirst to unfold no evil we are not eager to complain of no comfort without the sympathetic breathings of friendship no reputation without the voice of renown  in a word nothing without the aid of language at least nothing which can satisfy our understandings or flatter our inclinations Who then would be so indolent as to pay no attention to the graces or so wanting as to disregard the power of one faculty which gives lustre to every other Apolite nation can never entertain notions injurious to true taste Good education extends her care equally to the language of a people as their morals she does not confine herself to the adorning of the mind inwardly with wisdom science and virtue but labours also to grace it outwardly by teaching it the art of shewing itself to advantage Her desire is that our expressions should correspond with our thoughts and that our reputation should be answerable to our merit Speech then deserves our best attention and we ought to think ourselves  indebted to those who study its cultivation whether by learned rules drawn up according to its peculiar genius to give a knowledge of it with precision or by judicious criticisms in order to preserve its purity without rejecting the new advantages of which it is susceptible or by such useful acquisitions as may enrich it without rendering it unintelligible But how much should we be obliged to that person who could in any measure fix it and put a stop to those many innovations which mere caprice daily strives to introduce This is a task I fear beyond the power of individuals the destiny of whatever is living forbids its continuing always in the same state However be the fate of our language in afterages as it may neither the fear of its alteration nor even its annihilation shall deter me from publishing the observations I have  made They have neither the rules of grammar nor the purity of custom for their object but the delicate difference only between words reputed synonymous that is to say the distinguishing characteristics of such words as resembling each other in their general idea may nevertheless be distinguishable one from another by some additional one peculiar to each of them from whence arises on many occasions a necessity of choice in order to use them with propriety and elegance a thing as uncommon as it is beautiful and by which taste is enabled to give brilliancy to truth and solidity to wit Avoiding all empty words it teaches us to reason soundly averse to the abuse of terms it makes our diction intelligible judicious in the choice of words it gives ease and elegance to our expressions with the greatest accuracy it banishes all farfetched  vague and spiritless images with which the trifling and superficial are content to express themselves an enemy to confusion it prevents our rambling in the study of the sciences in short I will venture to affirm that this spirit of justness and distinction is the true ray that shines and in conversation is the lively touch that distinguishes the man of delicacy and discernment from the vulgar and illiterate  In order to acquire this justness we must be a little nice upon words not imagining that such as are called synonymous are really so exactly uniform in their sense and resemble each other as perfectly as two drops of water from the same spring for on a closer examination we shall see that this resemblance does not take in the whole extent and force of signification but consists only in one principal  idea which they all express each word differing from the other by some relative one which constitutes its proper and particular character That resemblance which conveys one general idea makes then the words synonymous and the difference that arises from the particular idea that accompanies the general makes them far from being perfectly alike distinguishing them as various shades of the same colour  I will not absolutely say that there are not occasions on which so nice a choice may be dispensed with but I maintain that there are still more where they ought not or cannot pass one for another especially in studied and elaborate compositions I will allow it to be a matter of indifference in choosing a yellow habit whether we take the hue of the marigold or jonquil but would we make an  agreeable variety it is necessary to consult the different shades or tints how seldom then does it happen that the mind does not find itself in similar circumstances Very rare indeed as in that consists the whole art of writing  Lest any one under a false notion that the richness of a language consists in the plurality and abundance of words should explode this system of mine relative to the dictinction of those reputed synonymous I must say that though language is enriched by an abundance of words yet that abundance is not merely numeral which is fit for nothing but as it were to fill the coffers of a miser but such as springs from diversity like that which is observed in the various productions of nature It is the satisfaction of the mind and not the tickling of the ear which is the object of all conversation  and writing for which reason the quantity of words is not so much to be esteemed as their quality If they vary only from each other in their sounds and not in their greater or less degrees of energy comprehension precision c they in my opinion serve more to burthen the memory than enrich or facilitate the art of speech To stand up for a number of words without any regard to their sense is confounding abundance with superfluity such a taste I cannot better compare than to that of the master of a feast who should think the magnificence of an entertainment consisted more in the number of dishes than of eatables Where is the great utility in having many terms to express one single idea Is there not more advantage in having proper expressions for every idea we can form  It will be in vain for Pleonasm to alledge in its defence that by this abundance we avoid the bad effects of repetition for we are deceived with respect to the cause of that effect it is not the repeating of the same sound that offends so much as the repetition of the same idea If the same word displeases when used a second time it is not because it hath already struck the ear but because it hath before affected the mind which grows weary and is disgusted without the graces of novelty Hence came the establishment of certain words we call Pronouns the repetition of which custom hath made familiar having given them no other office than simply to recall the matter in question without any redundancy of words For the same reason what we call Articles and Prepositions are equally repeated without disgust nothing being expected  from them but a bare nomination or indication for having nothing to determine of themselves they always appear new when the subject they indicate is new This is an undeniable proof that the beauty of words is more owing to their variety of meanings than to their different articulations and that 'tis a multiplicity of ideas that produces in effect a multiplicity of terms If any one yet doubts this he has nothing to do but to examine them a little closer and be a little nicer in his choice or without giving himself the trouble of such examination let him peruse only with attention the reflections here laid before him for be the remarks either just or not they will plainly shew that there are no words so perfectly synonymous as to signify exactly the same upon all occasions consequently they admit of a particular nicety  in choice It is this choice the following sheets endeavour to determine by definitions and examples which distinguish and disclose the proper character of these words in which it is hoped they will in some measure succeed  With respect to the work itself it may be said without either vanity or affected modesty that it is copied from no one neither was there any one to copy if it therefore merits nothing from the manner of its execution it will at least from its novelty to this may be added that of variety for almost every page contains something differing from and independent of that which goes before or follows after although of the same sort Never book was at the same time more uniform and more diversisied its perusal needs not be either continued or regular let the reader open it where he  will he cannot fail of finding something and that entire which will at least satisfy his curiosity if not content his understanding it will serve as well to amuse a quarter of an hour as employ a whole day and may be taken up and laid aside at any time  THE AUTHOR's PREFACE  AFTER giving the reader a translation of  Girard's  Preface it will be unnecessary to say more relative to the  usefulness  of the work than that as a great  inattention  to the beauties of language is general almost in  every  country a volume or two of  this  kind must be  equally  acceptable  here  as in  France  and it is hoped the great esteem the  Abbé  acquired by  his  piece and the many editions  that  has run through are  sufficient  proofs of its  excellence  and will be  some  excuse for  this  similar attempt As much of the  French  treatise as would agree with the  English  mode of expression is translated and adapted to it and if such translation be found in no respect  uniform  it must be attributed to  impossibility  Should any one imagine because some words which are here classed as  passing  for  synonymous  do not  immediately  strike the mind as  such  that labouring at a  distinction  was unnecessary and useless if he cannot recollect a passage where he has  seen  or call to mind that he has at any time  heard  them  indiscriminately  used let him cast his eye over the  folio  edition of  Johnson's  dictionary and he will  instantly  discover that these endeavours though  inadequate  to the task have not been  wholly  fruitless and should the same error be remarked in the following pages which the tenor of the work condemns it is hoped it will be attributed to the necessity of varying the expressions in a treatise of this  particular  cast in order to make them agreeable to the mind There are it must be confessed  many  more words that  might  have been taken under consideration but on reflection that a  thorough  reform even in  these  at  present  taken notice of will go a  considerable  way towards the  improvement  of our tongue the work cannot  but  be thought of service  One  motive that prevented the  extension  of these sheets was a  fear  of  frighting  the reader from attempting to  pass through  them by laying before him the  difficulty  and  length  of the way should they chance to meet with approbation they may hereafter probably  be  enlarged  but on the contrary should they on  close  examination be found too  imperfect  for public notice let them at least be considered as the wanton  sallies  of a mind  greatly  zealous for the  beauty  of its  native  language  ERRATA  VOL I  Page line  for decrease  in virtue a  decrease  in piety c  read decrease  in virtue A  decrease  in piety c p l  for  a bearing witness c  r  a bearing witness c p l

abandon  and  leave  imply involuntary acts the words  forsake relinquish  and  desert  those that are voluntary  To  abandon  is more applicable to things  leave  to persons He was under a necessity of  abandoning  his possessions and compelled to  leave  his friends  To  forsake  implies leaving in resentment or dislike to  relinquish  quitting  any claim to to  desert  leaving meanly or treacherously  Being treated with disrespect we are apt to  forsake  even the person whose cause we were studious to espouse Every honest man finding his plea not backed by justice would readily  relinquish  his claim and even make his competitor a recompence adequate to the expence and trouble he had put him to It is an act of the greatest baseness to  desert  one's friend in time of distress  To  quit  implies the breaking off from and may be either voluntary or involuntary  When he had acquired by trade sufficient to support himself for the remainder of his life he prudently  quitted  his business Being overpowered by superior strength he was obliged to  quit  his hold  We should by no means  abandon  while we can keep possession nor  leave  while we are able to stay we should not  forsake  without sufficient reason nor are we bound to  relinquish  but when our title is bad No colour of excuse can be alledged for  desertion  nor should we ever  quit  with a view of laying hold again  To  Abdicate Renounce Resign  To  abdicate  is an involuntary act  renounce  and  resign  are voluntary  Abdicate  more particularly relates to a throne  renounce  to matters of religion  resign  to employments  King James the second  abdicated  the throne of England when he could keep possession of it no longer Many persons through conviction of mind have formally  renounced  the errors of the church of Rome We frequently  resign  our employments through a desire of retirement  To  abdicate  a crown is ever looked upon as disgraceful to  renounce  a religion as honourable when done through the prevalence of truth and to  resign  and office as noble when generously given up in favour of another and with the approbation of the person we serve  To  Abale Diminish  To  Decrease Lessen  These words are nearly synonymous when they are verbs neuter they then mean to grow less as verbs active they are very different Even as neuters they will carry some difference in their meaning  To  abate  implies a decrease in action  diminish  a waste in substance  decrease  a decay in moral virtue  lessen  a contraction of parts  Want of spirits when a man is running will  abate  his ardour and consequently his pace Febrifuges if properly applied will  abate  a fever Put sugar into water and it will  diminish  visibly An object seemingly  diminishes  in proportion to the distance from which we view it  Through a contempt of religion men daily  decrease  in virtue a  decrease  in piety is usually accompanied with false notions of God Draw the air from a blownup bladder and it  lessens  proportionably  As verbs active to  abate  more particularly implies to lower in the price of  diminish  to make less by abscision or destruction either with respect to bulk value quality or quantity  lessen  to a voluntary act of degradation  Shopkeepers generally ask their customers an advanced price for goods that they may be enabled to  abate  if desired  By dividing of substance we  diminish  its bulk by breaking a diamond we  diminish  its value by mixing water with spirits we  diminish  the quality and by taking one yard from ten we  diminish  the quantity  A mean action always  lessens  us in the sight of good men and whatever false notions vanity may inculcate we ever seem  less  when we strive to appear greater  To  Abhor Hate  To  Loath Detest  All these words imply aversion but require to be differently used upon different occasions  To  abhor  implys an aversion to that to which we have a natural antipathy  hate  an aversion actuated by revenge  loath  is  more applicable to food  detest  implies aversion actuated by disapprobation  We  abhor  what we cannot endure We are apt to  hate  the person who injures us We  loath  the food by which we have been surfeited We  detest  the man who is guilty of a mean action  The spendthrift naturally  abhors  niggardliness and the niggard profligacy The  hatred  of the revengeful man is roused whenever the object of his revenge approaches The stomach  loaths  the very sight of that meat by which we have been satiated Every thinking man  detests  the least degree of meanness more particularly that which is fordid or base    Abject Low Mean Beggarly  As the words  abject  and  low  are indiscriminately used when meant to signify a person's state or condition so are the words  mean  and  beggarly  when we would express the disposition but the impropriety of so doing is very evident  By  abject  is understood that forlorn situation  in life that a man brings himself into by ill conduct by  low  that in which Providence has placed him the first is voluntary the latter involuntary  Divine Wisdom hath thought proper for various reasons to make distinctions between men placing some in a higher sphere others in a  lower  but never was he the cause of any one's  abjectness  Want of merit or fortune often renders a man  low  but it must be a villainous character to make him  abject  With respect to the words  mean  and  beggarly  when meant to express the disposition the absurdity of using them one for the other is equally visible  Mean  signifies a man's readiness to perform a dirty or illicit action whereas  beggarly  is more particularly expressive of a narrow groveling spirit  He who can stoop to be guilty of a  meanness  merits the contempt of all who know him It has ever been accounted  beggarly  to live below the rank of life we are in  When a man is brought into a state of penury and contempt by a long course of infamy we justly call him  abject  if his  narrow circumstances are only owing to the poverty of his parents we then repute him  low  when guilty of any thing beneath the character of an honest man or a gentleman we account him  mean  and when the treasures of the rich are sullied by the narrow notions of the poor we call it  beggarly  To  Abolish Abrogate Disannul  To  Repeal Revoke  Abolish  is a term rather to be used with respect to customs  abrogate  and  repeal  with regard to laws  disannul  and  revoke  to private contracts  When old customs have been by long experience found to be detrimental they have very prudently been  abolished  New fashions  abolish  old ones  The word  abrogate  is generally used with respect to ancient laws  repeal  to modern that is when we talk of rendering old laws null we call it  abrogating  when those lately made  repealing  Despotic power has frequently  abrogated  what was instituted by equity Upon the  enaction of a new law many inconveniences have sometimes appeared before unthought of this has occasioned a  repeal  The  abrogation  of a fundamental law frequently causes the ruin of the sovereign or of the people and sometimes of both The legislative power has often found itself obliged to  repeal  an act of parliament one sessions which passed the last merely to appease the clamours of the people  The difference in meaning between the words  disannul  and  revoke  is not very great yet such as to admit of a distinction  Disannul  is applied to a written contract  revoke  to a verbal  He who gives a conditional bond to another has a right to  disannul  it if the specified conditions are not punctually observed To  revoke  a promise nowadays is no other than fashionable whereas formerly it was considered as a breach of friendship  To  Finish Complete  To  End Conclude  With respect to the three first words the proper idea of  finishing  is the bringing a  thing to its last period the  completion  of any thing is the actual arrival of that last period and the characteristic of  ending  is cessation or discontinuation  Lazy people begin many things without  finishing  any We ever feel a secret satisfaction in the  completion  of a work we have been long about May we not question the wisdom of those laws which instead of  ending  suits do but serve to prolong them  By the word  conclude  we understand performing the last act of ratiocination widely differing from  complete  We  complete  a piece of mechanism but  conclude  an oration  A piece of clockwork is of little value till  completed  It is allowed by all Rhetoricians that the greatest ornament of an harangue is a well finished  conclusion  We  finish  what we have begun by continuing to work at it We  complete  a work by putting the last hand to it We  end  it by discontinuation Thus we may  finish  without  ending  and  end  without  completing    On Upon  These two words are indiscriminately used one for another on all occasions but with great impropriety  On  rather signifies by as  on  my word  on  my honour c whereas  upon  means up on the top of and is applied to matter as  upon  the table  upon  the chair  upon  the house c  The absurdity of a contrary diction is evident from the following change of words it was his honour  upon  which he swore  Indeed the word  upon  is used with elegance even detached from substance when the sense is figurative as for instance he relied  upon  the promise of his friend intimating that that promise was the staff  upon  which he leaned but on other occasions the impropriety is gross    Action Act Deed  As custom has applied the word  deed  chiefly to signify the written evidence of any legal act it will be necessary only to shew the difference between the words  action  and  act  The word  action  then is applicable indifferently to every thing we do whether common or extraordinary but the word  act  should signify something done which is remarkable  An elegant speaker will not say a  virtuous act  a  good or a vitious act  but an  act of virtue  or  of goodness  or  of iniquity  whereas to say a  virtuous action  or  a good  or  vitious action  is proper and elegant  'Tis generally speaking a good  action  to conceal the faults of our neighbours and it is the rarest  act  of charity among mankind  The sentiments of the heart are not so much to be judged of from words as from  actions  It is an  act  of great heroism  to pardon our enemies when we have power to be revenged on them  These two words are further distinguishable by our considering them somewhat physically The word  action  in this light relates more to the power that acts and the word  act  is more applicable to the effect itself produced by that power this makes the one properly the attribute of the other so that it may be justly said we should always have a presence of mind attendant upon our  actions  to render all of them either  acts  of bounty or  acts  of justice  To  Enlarge Increase  The word  enlarge  is properly used to signify an addition of extent  Increase  is critically applicable only to number height and quantity  We  enlarge  a town a field a garden We  increase  the inhabitants of a town our expences our revenues  The former word is more suitable to one entire and vast quantity of space the  latter to any gross and multiplied quantity in general thus it is commonly said that we have  enlarged  our house when we have made it more extensive by adding buildings to the sides of it but we usually say a house is  increased  with an additional story or with several new rooms  By  enlarging  our territory we generally  increase  our riches Princes certainly  enlarge  their renown by widening the bounds of their dominions and they are apt to think they at the same time  increase  their power but in this they are sometimes mistaken for such an  enlargement  may chance to produce only an  increase  of cares and troubles which may end in their utter ruin  A king who labours more after acquiring new subjects than in governing those he already has may  enlarge  his fame but will never  increase  his happiness    Address Air Mien Behaviour Manners Deportment Carriage  What is called our  air mien  and  carriage  seem to be born with us and strike at first  sight our  address manners behaviour  and  deportment  are owing to education and gradually disclose themselves in our intercourse with the world  Mien  rather relates to our look  carriage  to our frame but the word  air  to both We usually judge of the  mien  by the face the  carriage  by the person and the  air  by both  How sweet is the  mien  that has good humour in the countenance A gentleman though in rags is easily discovered by his graceful  carriage  An open countenance and majesty of person give a man the most engaging  air  imaginable  Address  is confined to our words  deportment  to our actions  behaviour  arises from both and the fruit of  behaviour  is  manners  Our  address  shall often please when our  deportment  shall disgust and VICE VERSA  When our  address  is engaging and our  deportment  comformable 'tis impossible our  behaviour  should be otherwise  In order to be well with the world we should suit our  behaviour  to our company which though in the eye of some persons  has been considered as deceitful must in the end be looked upon as the height of good  manners  An engaging  air  which is the union of a charming  mien  and graceful  carriage  is necessary to make any thing please but unless accompanied with good  manners  arising from a genteel  address  and  deportment  it becomes perfectly disgustful  To  Accost Approach  We  accost  those with whom we would speak but often  approach  without any intention to  address  The bold can  accost  without the least hesitation We cannot  approach  the great without some kind of ceremony  When we have any thing to say to a person we naturally  accost  him when we would insinuate ourselves into his good graces we endeavour to  approach  him  Education teaches us to  accost  the ladies with civility but to  approach  them requires some kind of assurance seafoned with respect    Ingenuity Cleverness Abilities Parts  Ingenuity  relates more to the invention of things  cleverness  to the manner of executing them  ability  to the actual execution of them and  parts  to the discernment The third then puts in use what the second dictates pursuant to the digested plan of the fourth invented by the first  A man may be  ingenious  and not  clever  he may be  clever  without  abilities  to execute and he may have great  abilities  and yet not be a man of  parts  Admitting we are not very  ingenious  still if we are accustomed to the management of things we may be  clever  but it requires  abilities  to do with them as we would and  parts  to conduct them  He who discovered the powers of refraction and reflection had he known nothing more would have been  ingenious  he who constructed the telescope was  clever  the finisher was a man of  abilities  and without doubt the philosopher he who applies the instrument to the various purposes of astronomy must be a man of  parts  To  Add Augment  By  adding  one thing to another we  augment  the same By the word  adding  we understand the joining of different things together or if they are things of the same kind joining them in such a manner as not to confound them but that after such junction each may be distinguished from the other whereas the word  augment  indicates our making a thing larger or more abundant by such an addition as shall cause it afterwards to appear one and the same thing or at least that when the addition is made the whole together shall be conceived under one idea thus for example we  add  one basket of rubbish to another one room to another but we  augment  the heap and the house  There are many who would not scruple to  augment  their own stock by fraudulently  adding to  it that of another  To  add  is a verb active only  augment  both active and neuter  Our ambition  augments  with our fortune and we are no sooner in possession of  one hundred pounds than we are eager to  add  to it another  To  Study Learn  To  study  implies a uniform application in search of knowledge to  learn  that application with success  We  study  to  learn  and  learn  by dint of  study  People of vivacity  learn  easily but are heavy at  study  We can  study  but one thing at a time but we may  learn  many  The more we  learn  the more we know but oftentimes the more we  study  the less we know  We have  studied  well when we have  learned  to doubt  There are many things we  learn  without  study  and other things we  study  without  learning  Those are not the wisest who have  studied  most but those who have  learnt  most  We see some persons  studying  continually without  learning  any thing and others  learning  almost every thing without the least  study  The time of our youth is the time of  study  but it is in a more advanced age when we truly can be said to  learn  it is then only we have capacity to digest what we have before laid up in the memory    Buttress Support Prop  The  Buttress  fortifies it is fixed close to resist the impulsion of other bodies the  support  bears by being placed beneath a thing to prevent its falling under a weight the  prop  assists and its general use is to strengthen  A wall is frequently made stronger by  buttresses  An arch is  supported  by columns A house when in danger of falling is kept up by  props  That which has received a violent thrust or is much bulged stands in need of a  buttress  that which is too heavy to  carry itself is in want of  supporters  and that which ought to stand upright and cannot be made to do so of itself must be  propped  In a figurative sense  buttress  relates more to defence  support  to credit and  prop  to friendship  The true Christian seeks no  buttress  against the malignity of men but that of innocence and integrity he makes work the most solid  support  of his life and looks upon implicit obedience to the decree of heaven as the most steady  prop  of his felicity    Enough Sufficient  The object of both these words is quantity but with this difference that  enough  relates more to the quantity one desires to have and  sufficient  to that quantity one really wants to employ  Thus the avaritious man never has  enough  let him accumulate ever so much he still desires more and the prodigal never  sufficient  he still wanting to expend more than he has  We say we have  enough  when we wish not for more and we say we have  sufficient  when we have just what is necessary  When applied to such things as are consumable the word  enough  seems to denote a much greater quantity than the word  sufficient  for in relation to such things when we say we have  enough  it seems as though we should have too much had we more but what we call  sufficient  may be added to without coming near that extreme for we may say of a very small income or revenue that it is  sufficient  though at the same time we can hardly think it  enough  The word  enough  has a more general and comprehensive meaning the word  sufficient  a more limited and particular one  An hour at table is certainly  sufficient  for our nourishment but not  enough  for some persons pleasure or satisfaction  An oeconomist can find  enough  where there is very little but the prodigal never has  sufficient  let him have ever so much  To  Declare Affirm Protest Aver Assert  To  Maintain Swear Avouch Attest  In the first seven words we find different degrees of declaration To  declare  signifies to tell any thing simply but seriously to  affirm  means to say confidently to  protest  implies a solemn affirmation to  aver  signifies a positive declaration to  assert  that declaration defended to  maintain  implies a support of such assertion to  swear  is to ratify it by an oath  When we give our opinion on being seriously asked we are said to  declare  it when we would give that declaration more force we  affirm  it and to strengthen that affirmation we  protest  it solemnly that is we  affirm  it by invoking the Deity  The other words are sufficiently explained above  If ever we wish to gain credit in the world whatever we  declare  should be backed by truth True politeness forbids our  affirming  any thing unless required by the obligations of justice To make frequent use of  protestations  betrays a suspicion that our bare word is not to be believed Always to  aver  hath an appearance of dogmatising and shews us ignorant of that proper degree of diffidence which ever accompanies wisdom Some persons are so ready to  assert  that let the matter be right or wrong 'tis equally the same When our opinions are just and wellgrounded we have an undoubted right to  maintain  them  Swearing  was first instituted in courts of judicature as a conscientious testimony of truth  The words  avouch  and  attest  tho' often usedas synonynous with the foregoing have a very different signification The word  avouch  implies an assertion in defence of another  attest  a bearing witness to what another has just before said  When the reputation of an honest man has been undeservedly hurt 'tis the part of a friend to  avouch  his good character  Too much care to  attest  all that is advanced renders our conversation tiresome  There is another verb  warrant  which has some affinity to the word  maintain  but as custom has made the use of it vulgar  it is unnecessary to take any further notice of it    Arms Weapons  By  arms  we understand those instruments of offence generally made use of in war such as firearms swords c By  weapons  we more particularly mean instruments of other kinds exclusive of fire arms made use of as offensive on especial occasions  In the state of Switzerland all men are obliged to learn the use of  arms  in their youth that in cases of extremity they may be capable of defending themselves against the attacks of their enemies  In times of insurrection people make use of such  weapons  as they can get    Attractions Allurements Charms  Besides the general idea which makes these three words appear synonymous it is likewise their common fate scarce ever to be used in the singular number at least in those senses in which they are here considered that is whenever they are used to signify the power of beauty of agreeableness or of any thing which pleases  With respect to their different meanings it appears to me that  attractions  mean something natural  allurements  somewhat rather artificial and  charms  somewhat stronger and more uncommon than either  Attractions  may be said to engage us  allurements  to entice us  charms  to seduce us  The heart of man can scarce stand against the  attractions  of a pretty woman It is with difficulty he can defend himself against the allurements of a  coquette  but  to resist the  charms  of a sweettempered beauty is impossible  Ladies always owe their  attractions  and their  charms  to a happy formation of their features and persons but they sometimes procure their  allurements  at their toilettes  I know not whether I may fall in with the taste of mankind but in my opinion  attractions  rise from those ordinary graces which nature has bestowed upon the women with more or less liberality and which are the common appendages of the sex  allurements  from those cultivated graces which form a faithful mirrour of the natural and are studied merely with a desire to please  charms  from those singular graces which nature sometimes bestows as a most valuable gift and which are more particular and personal  Defects not seen at first but afterwards observed lessen  attractions  greatly  Allurements  vanish as soon as the artifice appears  Charms  lose their force when time and custom hath rendered them familiar  These words are not in use only with regard to beauty and the graces of the sex but with respect to every thing that pleases In this case  attractions  and  charms  are applied only to such things as are amiable in themselves whereas the word  allurements  is sometimes applied to such things as are even in themselves odious but which we love nevertheless  Virtue has  attractions  which the most vicious of men cannot avoid being sensible of The riches of the world are  allurements  which never fail to captivate in spite of their ill tendency Pleasure has such  charms  that it is hunted after by every one as well by the philosopher as the libertine  We say great  attractions  powerful  allurements  and invincible  charms  Honour  attracts  fortune  allures  but the  charms  of glory are invincible    Miserly Niggardly Covetous Avaritious  The word  miserly  signifies rather a parcimonious disposition or a depriving ourselves of the necessaries of life merely to hoard the riches we possess By  niggardly  we understand that sordid temper that does things by halves  Covetous  implies an eager craving for the possessions of another By  avaritious  we mean that inordinate thirst of gain that makes a man grasp atevery thing he sees Taking the words in these fenses which are undoubtedly the proper ones we may be  covetous  and not  avaritious niggardly  and not  miserly  He who never gives any thing away is justly called  miserly  he who fails to bestow when necessary or when he bestows gives too little draws on himself the epithet of  niggardly  he who longs for the goods of another is  covetous  and he who grasps at wealth by all means whatever  avaritious  Of all extraordinary beings there is no greater one than the  miser  who punishes himself and starves in the midst of plenty  The  miser  is laughed at but the  niggard  is despised  The contented man is at quiet within himself but the  covetous  is ever on the rack he eagerly wishes for what another possesses and his inability of obtaining it is his continual torment  It is necessary to be ever watchful of an  avaritious  man for his disposition leads him to take every opportunity of defrauding you    Acknowledgment Confession  Acknowledgment  supposes a question asked whereas  confession  favours a little of accusation  We  acknowledge  what we had an inclination to conceal We  confess  that which we were blameable in doing  It is interrogation which causes  acknowledgment  repentance  confession  It is better to make a sincere  acknowledgment  than a bad excuse  We should not  confess  to all sorts of people  An  acknowledgment  unasked is either noble or foolish according to the circumstances and effect it produces  Confession  unaccompanied with repentance is an insult to the Deity  It would be want of spirit to  acknowledge  a fault without a certainty that such  acknowledgment  would be satisfactory and it would be foolish to make  confession  without hopes of pardon for why should we declare ourselves culpable to those who breathe nothing but vengeance    Admonition Advice Counsel  The end of  admonition  is gentle reproof  Advice  and  counsel  are to convey instruction but with this difference that  advice  implies no superiority with respect either to rank or parts in the person who gives it whereas  counsel  generally carries with it one if not both  Admonition  in a master frequently has a greater effect than correction  People are readier to give  advice  than to take it  Parents should take care to  counsel  their children before they turn them out into the world  Admonition  should be given with temper  Advice  with sincerity and  counsel  with art and modesty  Admonish  a friend in private but reward him openly  Nothing is more salutary than good  advice  and yet nothing is more nauseous to take  When  counsel  is given with an air of impertinence it is sure to make the  counsel  despised and the counsellor odious  To  Have Possess  In order to  have  a thing it is not necessary to have the power of disposal of it or to have it actually in our hands it is sufficient that it belongs to us but to  possess  it it must be in our hands and we have the liberty of disposing of it whenever we think proper  Thus we  have  an estate notwithstanding it is mortgaged for the benefit of our creditors but as to riches we  possess  them  We are not always masters of what we  have  we are of what we  possess  A married man  has  continual torment when the Demon of Jealousy  possesses  him  We  have  often but the half of things partaking them with others we  possess  them when they are entirely our own  Those who  have  only the knowledge of arts follow their rules but those who  possess  them lay down their rules to follow    Battle Combat Fight  Battle  is an action more general and commonly preceded by some preparation  Combat  seems to be an action more particular and often unexpected  Fight  may be either one or the other and is seldom used in the plural  Thus the  fight  between the Carthaginians and the Romans and that at Pharsalia between Caesar and Pompey were  battles  but those in which the Horatii and the Curatii decided the fate of Rome were  combats    Handsome Pretty Beautiful  It is the fate of these words when applied to the female sex to be used indiscriminately one for the other and yet at the same time no three words can be more different  By a  handsome  woman we understand one that is graceful and well shaped with a regular disposition of features by a  pretty  we mean one that is delicately made and whose features are so formed as to please by a  beautiful  a union of both  A lady may be  handsome  and not  pretty pretty  and not  handsome  but to be  beautiful  she must be both  pretty  and  handsome  Many a  handsome  woman has a forbidding countenance  It has been the misfortune of many a  pretty  woman to be crooked  A  beautiful  woman is nowadays very rare to be met with  Prettiness  carries an idea of simplicity  handsomeness  of nobility  beauty  of majesty  The ladies in romances are described as either  beautiful  or  handsome  the shepherdesses by the poets are represented as  pretty  so in other things we say a  beautiful  palace a  handsome  house a  pretty  cottage  A  beautiful  woman is an object of curiosity a  handsome  woman of admiration and a  pretty  one of love  When applied to other things  beautiful  relates to something more serious and engaging  pretty  to somewhat more gay and diverting this is the reason why we say a  beautiful  tragedy but a  pretty  comedy    Benignity Benevolence Kindness Tenderness Humanity  Benignity  is a sort of kind condescention and an attribute of princes only  Benevolence  a wishing well to mankind and seems relative to those who have more particularly the power of doing good  Kindness  is the same disposition among equals  Tenderness  is a susceptibility of impression and more applicable to persons nearly connected  Humanity  denotes a fellow feeling for the distresses even of a stranger  Benegnity benevolence  and  kindness  spring from the will  tenderness  and  humanity  from the heart  The  benignity  of a prince makes him universally beloved by his subjects  Benevolence  is a shining character and is more conspicuous for the charitable actions it produces  Kindness  is what one man naturally expects from another and what we are reciprocally bound to impart  The  tenderness  of a parent has often been the ruin of a child  The distresses of individuals will often draw tears from a person truly  humane  From the very instant of our birth we experience the  benignity  of heaven and malignity of corrupt nature  The realized  benevolence  of some good men have almost made them worshiped by their fellow creatures  Kindnesses  are in the power of every one to shew therefore he that withholds them favours more of the brute than of the man  The great  tenderness  of animals to their young is a standing reproof to the many unfeeling mothers  True  humanity  consists in not treating with rigour but excusing the weaknesses supplying the defects assuaging the pains and comforting the afflictions of our neighbour    Poverty Indigence Want Need Necessity  Poverty  is that situation of fortune opposed to riches in which we are deprived of the conveniences of life  Indigence  is a degree lower we there want the necessaries and is opposed to superfluity  Want  seems rather to arrive by accident implies a scarcity of provisions rather than a lack of money and is opposed to abundance  Need  and  necessity  relate less to the situation of life than the other three words but more to the relief we expect or the remedy we seek with this difference between the two that  need  seems less pressing than  necessity  Merit or a fortunate circumstance in life frequently extricates us from a state of  poverty  in which we were born and in which prodigality often plunges the rich  Diligence is the best remedy against  indigence  which is generally the just punishment of idleness  Wise precautions prevent  want  which is often brought on by extravagance  When we are in  need  we should seek assistance from our friends but be careful not to importune too much  The means of obtaining relief in extreme  necessity  is to implore the succour of the truly charitable  A state of  poverty  is most conducive to the health of the soul we being there out of the way of temptations  The man who opens his hand to the cravings of the  indigent  feels within his breast a secret satisfaction which the uncharitable man is an entire stranger to  He that will waste will  want  A friend in  need  is a friend indeed  Necessity  is the mother of invention    Goodfortune Prosperity  What we call  goodfortune  is the effect of chance it comes unexpected  Prosperity  is the success of conduct and comes by degrees  Fools have sometimes  good fortune  wise men do not always  prosper  The Capital that was saved by the cackling of geese and not by the vigilance of the centinels is a piece of history more proper to shew the  goodfortune  of the Romans than their military government on that occasion though on all others their wise conduct has contributed as much to their  prosperity  as the valour of their soldiers    Goodnature Goodhumour  These terms though very expressive of their respective meanings are too often  for want of proper discernment confounded  We may be  goodhumoured  and not  goodnatured goodnatured  and yet not always  goodhumoured  To make this properly appear it is necessary to give a full definition of each  By  goodnature  is meant that disposition which partakes the felicity of all mankind that promotes the satisfaction of every individual within the reach of its ability that relieves the distressed comforts the afflicted diffuses blessings and communicates happiness as far as its sphere of action can extend whereas  goodhumour  is nothing more than a chearful pleasing deportment arising either from a natural gaiety of mind or an affectation of popularity joined to an affability of behaviour which is the result of goodbreeding and a compliance with the taste of every companyThis kind of  goodhumour  is by far the most striking quality 'tis frequently mistaken for and complimented with the superior name of real  goodnature  A man by this specious appearance has often acquired that appellation who in all the actions of his private life has been a morose  cruel revengeful sullen haughty tyrant On the contrary a man of a true benevolent disposition and formed to promote the happiness of all around him may sometimes perhaps from an ill habit of body an accidental vexation or a commendable openness of heart above the meanness of disguise be guilty of little sallies of peevishness or  illhumour  that may carry the appearance of and be unjustly thought to proceed from  illnature  by persons who are not acquainted with his true character and who take them for synonymous terms tho' in reality they have not the least analogy to each other    Happiness Felicity Bliss  These three words denote equally an advantageous state and agreeable situation but that of  happiness  marks properly the state of fortune capable of dispensing pleasures and placing them within our reach that of  felicity  expresses particularly the state of  the heart disposed to ta  e pleasure which it finds in whatsoever it possesses that of  bliss  which conveys a mys  idea paints a state of imagination which we anticipate as it were from a thorough conviction that we shall inherit it hereafter  Our  happiness  glares in the eyes of the world and exposes us often to envy Our  felicity  is known only to ourselves and gives us continual satisfaction The idea of  bliss  extends itself beyond a life temporal  We are sometimes in a state of  happiness  without being in a state of  felicity Happiness  consists in the possession of wealth honours friends and health but 'tis the satisfaction of the mind and the enjoyment of those things that constitutes  felicity  As to  bliss  it is the portion of the godly and depends in each religion on the persuasion of the mind  Satisfaction without forms the  happiness  of man satisfaction within his felicity  bliss  must be asked of God The first is within the reach of riches the second of wisdom but the third is reserved for those whom the scripture calls the poor in spirit    Confines Limits Bounds  Confines  are where we are at liberty to go  Limits  are what we ought not to pass  Bounds  are what we can not pass  We approach or get farther from the  confines  we contract or extend the  limits  we advance or remove the  bounds  By  confines  we rather understand the edge or border the  confines  of a country not surrounded by the sea are generally distinguished by rivers or hills  He who continually exceeds the  limits  which temperance hath set will soon find himself on the  confines  of the grave  They say with more eloquence than truth that the  limits  of the Roman empire were those of the world  The Sea the Alps and the Pirenean mountains are the natural  bounds  of France  Ambition knows no  bounds  and we are never happy but when the  bounds  of our fortune are those of our desire    Extremity End  Each of these words signifies the least of those parts which constitutes a thing but with this difference that  extremity  supposes a situation and an arrangement intimating the greatest distance whereas  end  supposes a length only and denotes that place where the length ceases  Extremity  answers to the centre  end  to the beginning thus we say the  extremity  of a kingdom the  end  of life    Aim View Design  The  aim  is more fixed we take every method to pursue it the  view  more vague we make use of means to accomplish it the  design  more close we leave nothing undone to complete it  A good prince has no other  design  in his government than to render his state flourishing  because he has the happiness of his people in  view  and true glory is his  aim  The true Christian has no other  aim  than heaven no other  view  than to please God nor any other  design  to complete than his own salvation  We are said to lay an  aim  to have  views  to form a  design  Reason forbids our laying any  aim  that is impossible to attain to  have  any chimerical  views  or to form any  design  we are unable to execute  If my  views  are just I have a  design  in my head that will bring me to my  aim    Burden Load  By the word  burden  we understand a weight possible to be born by  load  a weight more than we are able to bear  A light  burthen  is no inelegant expression but a light  load  certainly is  In the heat of summer our very cloaths are a  burthen  Many a poor animal is so inhumanly laden as to sink under the  load  Taken now in a figurative sense they are equally different  How unhappy is the man who feels the  burthen  of an evil conscience  We have sometimes thro' a bad habit of body such a  load  upon our spirits as not to be able to support ourselves    Charm Enchantment Spell  The word  charm  carries an idea of force which puts a stop to ordinary effects and natural causes The word  enchantment  is used properly for that which regards the illusion of the senses The word  spell  bears particularly an idea of something which disturbs the reason All the three in the literal sense mark the effect of a magical operation condemned by religion and laughed at by philosophy  Antiquated tales say there is a  charm  to destroy the effect of arms and make them  invulnerable We read in old romances of the surprising power of  enchantments  that have suddenly changed the manners and reversed the fortune Weak people have thought and do still believe that by means of a  spell  the health has been destroyed and the person so bewitched made raving mad but persons of good sense see no  charm  in the world but the caprice of passions with respect to reason which often suspends reflexion and stops the effects which that would naturally and necessarily produce they are acquainted with no other  enchantment  than that seduction arising from a depraved taste and disordered imagination they know also that which is foolishly attributed to the power of a  spell  maliciously laid is no other than the effect of a bad constitution which is frequently remedied by an application of proper medicines  To  Chastise Punish  To  Correct Discipline  We  chastise  him who has committed a fault to prevent his doing the same again we  punish  the person guilty of a crime by way of expiation and as an example to others To  correct  signifies to amend by means of  chastisement  to  discipline  means to regulate and instruct  We  chastise  a child in order to  correct  his manners officers are frequently obliged to  punish  a soldier with death to keep up good  discipline  in the regiment  It is necessary for good  correction  that the  chastisement  be not the effect of anger justice demands that the  punishment  be rigorous when the crime is enormous otherwise there can be no good  discipline  in the state  God like a tender father  chastises  us in this life that we may not be  punished  in the life to come  As the words  chastise  and  punish  are thought to have the nearest affinity to each  other it may not be unnecessary to shew a yet further difference between them  Chastise  then carries always with it an idea of subordination denoting an authority or superiority in him who  chastises  over the person  chastised  but the word  punishment  carries no such idea in its signification for we are sometimes  punished  by our equals by ourselves by our inferiors by the mere event of things or by the effects of the fault we have committed  Parents who thro' tenderness to their children forbear to  chastise  them are often  punished  for their folly by their future ingratitude and ill conduct    Prudence Discretion Care Caution  Prudence  is here the mother virtue and signifies wisdom applied to practise  discretion  is the effect of prudence and means a knowledge to govern or direct one's self By  care  we understand heed in order to  preservation  Caution  implies a greater degree of wariness  A proper attention to  prudence  would make us so  discreet  as to be  careful  in every thing we do and cause us to act with the greatest  caution  A hasty conduct can never be called  prudent  want of attention in affairs of moment is the greatest height of  indiscretion  for without that necessary qualification 'tis impossible any thing we do can be attended with success He who expects to do any thing well must act with  care  and he who is desirous of avoiding difficulties with  caution  To weigh matters well before we put them into execution is a mark of  prudence  A  discreet  man in the company of dangerous persons such as would take advantage of his words would be  careful  how he opened his mouth and would utter nothing but with the greatest  caution    Circumspection Consideration Regard  A proper attention to the manner of acting and conducting ourselves in our commerce with the world with respect to others contributing rather to their satisfaction than our own is the common and general idea which these three words present at first sight notwithstanding which it appears to me that their application should be different  Circumspection  principally takes place in discourse it prevents our letting any thing escape us that may do hurt or give offence and is the effect of prudence which risks nothing  Consideration  is more personal and relates particularly to our manner of treating other people making a proper distinction as different opportunities may offer and is the consequence of esteem and duty  Regard  relates more to the state or situation of persons being particularly careful to omit nothing which  good sense and politeness requires and is the fruit of a good education  To be well with the world requires  circumspection  when we are speaking before those with whom we are not acquainted  consideration  for people of rank and quality and  regard  towards those with whom we are interested  We ought to have a great deal of  circumspection  in conversations of religion and government because they are public matters and subjects on which particulars are not at liberty to say what they think especially if their thoughts are in opposition to those established in the country where they are It is not adviseable for our interests to omit shewing marks of  consideration  to such persons whose assistance we may stand in need of and from whom we hope to receive any service We cannot have too great a  regard  for the ladies it is what they expect and are displeased if we neglect    Cunning Finesse Device Artifice Trick Stratagem  Cunning  is the art of conducting designs in a manner proper to succeed  Finesse  is a French word lately adopted by the English and means an acting secretly and under cover  Device  is rather a pretty thought or contrivance  Artifice  is unnatural and a farfetched mean of executing designs  Trick  which eludes the senses implies a juggle and  stratagem  denotes a disguised way of obtaining our ends  The first three of these words are oftner understood in a good sense than the other  Cunning  is employed in using means  finesse  insinuates insensibly and must be accompanied by penetration  device  surprises and gives satisfaction  artifice  generally makes use of studied dissimulation a  trick  is commonly looked on as a fraud and a  stratagem  is oftener illicit than otherwise  Without some degree of  cunning  it will be impossible to deal with or guard against the generality of mankind  Finesse  is so essential to the courtier that without it he is seen through presently  Pretty  devices  declare the authors of them persons of ingenuity  We ought particularly to guard against a man who makes use of a great deal of  artifice  Jugglers perform  tricks  to divert and consequently if clever deserve applause but he who  tricks  his neighbour in order to serve himself is a rogue  All  stratagems  in war are lawful but in other cases they are ever considered as derogatory to the character of an honest man    Moment Instant  A  moment  is not long but an  instant  is still shorter The word  moment  has a signification more extended it is taken sometimes for time in general and is used in  a figurative sense that of  instant  is more contracted it marks the shortest duration or time and is never used but in the literal sense  All depends upon knowing the favourable  moment  sometimes an  instant  too soon or too late is all that makes the difference between success and misfortune  Let us banish thought as much as in our power still now and then a reflective moment will intrude The face of things which we have thought established have been frequently changed in an  instant  Every  moment  is dear to one who knows the value of time Every  instant  of our life is a step nearer the grave    Customs Manners Fashions  Customs  relate to the general practice of the people  manners  to their way of life and  fashions  to their dress  There cannot be a more ridiculous  custom  than that of persons complimenting  each other in time of divine service it being supposed they have there more material things to engross their attention  An increase or decrease of luxury has been found to have more or less influence on the  manners  of the people  It has been observed that there is a continual round of  fashions  when the new are worn out they then have recourse to the old and those old ones become new  To  Be Exist Subsist  Be  agrees with all sorts of subjects substances or modes with all manner of beings real or ideal  Exist  is used only with respect to substances and those real  Subsist  is applied equally to substances or modes but with reference to the duration of their being which is not expressed by the other two words  We say of qualities forms actions motions and of all their different relations that they  are  we say of matter spirit  bodies and all real beings that they  exist  We say of states works affairs laws and all establishments which are neither destroyed or changed that they  subsist  The verb  be  is commonly used to mark the event of any modification or quality in the subject that of  exist  is in use only to express the end of simple existence and we employ  subsist  to point out the duration of that existence or modification Thus we say that man  is  inconstant that the phoenix  exists  not that all human establishments  subsist  but for a time    Famous Illustrious Celebrated Renowned  Each of these qualities distinguishes the reputation but that which the word  famous  expresses means no more than a simple distinction of one country or age above another let that distinction be taken either in good part or bad That which the word  illustrious  expresses is founded upon a merit supported by dignity and glory which makes the object not only  known but admired and ranked among the great That which we understand by the word  celebrated  expresses a superior degree of talents with respect either to abilities or knowledge tho' it raises not the object to an equal degree of grandeur with the  illustrious  it is nevertheless honourable That which the word  renowned  denotes is founded only upon fashion or public taste which without casting much honour on the subject draws it simply from oblivion and makes its name known to the world  The maid of Orleans cried down by the English but esteemed by the French was equally  famous  in both nations Princes shine during their life but they are only  illustrious  in future ages by the monuments of grandeur wisdom and greatness which they leave behind them There are  celebrated  authors whose works we cannot find fault with and those which we cannot even commend without risking our own reputation A man's fortune is half made when once he becomes  renowned  in his profession  Famous celebrated  and  renowned  are equally applicable to persons or things  but  illustrious  to persons only at least when we would be nice in our choice of words  Erostratus among the Greeks set sire to the temple of Diana to make himself  famous  he was rendered more so by an order of the state that his name should never after be mentioned on pain of punishment The greatest part of our libels are of the same kind they raise a dust and become  famous  by being burnt by the hangman The Duke of Marlborough became  illustrious  by the many victories he obtained his glorious actions are  celebrated  in history so are the many courtintrigues of the Dutchess The Gobelins were so  renowned  that their names live in the place were they worked and in those works in which others imitate them It is a question whether the Phalernian wine was more  renowned  than those are of Champaigne and Burgundy    Excuse Pardon Forgiveness  We make  excuse  for an apparent fault or slight offence we ask  pardon  for a real fault or when the offence is greater We implore  forgiveness  of our sins The first is an apology in order to justify ourselves and is founded on politeness the second is the mark of a good disposition and is done in hopes of extenuation the last to avert the vengeance and declares repentance  The good mind  excuses  easily The good heart  pardons  readily God delights more in  forgiveness  than in  revenge  Excuse  is more used when we address ourselves to equals  pardon  to superiors and  forgiveness  to heaven  Good manners demand an  excuse  for that which turns out wrong let the intention be never so good It can never be a degradation to ask pardon of that person whom we have offended besides the superior rank of some persons makes it an absolute duty in the offender How great is the  presumption of that wretch who fancies himself not in need of the  forgiveness  of the Almighty    Duty Obligation  Duty  means something conscientious and springs from a law  obligation  something absolute in practice and springs from custom  We are said to fail in our  duty  and to dispense with an  obligation  It is the  duty  of a clergyman to carry himself modestly and he is  obliged  to wear dark coloured cloaths  Policy finds less disadvantage in neglecting her  duty  than in forgetting the least of her  obligations  To  Live Dwell  These two words are synonymous in that sense in which they signify residence  but  live  relates to the particular place where we inhabit  dwell  to the building in which we reside  We  live  in London in Middlesex in the country we  dwell  in a large house a cottage or a furnished lodging  When persons of distinction  live  in London they  dwell  in hovels comparatively speaking with their houses in the country  We say with great propriety I  live  all the summer in the country and have one of the prettiest  dwellings  imaginable  To  Stay Remain  The common idea of these two words is a cessation of progression and their difference consists in this that to  stay  seems to have less duration than to  remain  A good servant when sent on a message  stays  as short a time as possible  When we have given offence we should endeavour to make such an attonement that the offended party may not  remain  dissatisfied  The duration of time expressed by the word  stay  seems less determinate than that by the word  remain  Thus we say he  remained  at his country house a month he  stay'd  longer than we expected    Event Incident  Event  is a word most agreeable to states and governments  incident  to casualties in private life  The revolutions of the state are  events  that determine the happiness of the people  Our life is full of  incidents  which the eye of prudence cannot foresee  To  Awake Awaken  The first of these words is more frequently used in a literal sense the last in a figurative  The least noise  awakes  those who sleep indifferently It requires but little to  awaken  a passion which is not entirely rooted out from the heart    Heavy Weighty  The word  heavy  is more applicable to that which loads the body  weighty  to that which burdens the mind It requires strength to carry the one parts to support the other  A weak man finds that  heavy  which the strong find light The administration of state affairs is too  weighty  a concern for one person to undertake  To  Conquer Subdue Overcome  Each of these words implies resistance but that of  conquer  refers to victory over enemies  and is generally used in the literal sense that of  subdue  is more applicable to our passions being oftener used in a figurative and means a bringing under subjection that of  overcome  supposes efforts against any obstacle that opposes meaning rather to surmount  We have  conquered  our enemies when we have beat them in such a manner as to put it out of their power to do us any further hurt We may be said to have  subdued  our lusts when we are able to withstand every temptation We  overcome  our adversaries when we obtain our end in spite of every opposition  It requires courage and valour to  conquer  endeavour and resolution to  subdue  patience and perseverance to  overcome  Alexander gloried more in his  conquests  than in any other thing upon earth Of all passions avarice is the most difficult to  subdue  as neither age or weakness of constitution is able to rebate its edge We should strive to  overcome  evil with good    To no purpose Ineffectually In vain  We work  to no purpose  when we meet not with the reward we expected to receive  Ineffectually  when that which we have done answers not the end proposed  In vain  when our work is of no kind of use whatever  I shall have worked  to no purpose  if these sheets meet not with the approbation of the public  Ineffectually  if after all my trouble I have not been able to shew the true difference between words reputed synonymous and  in vain  if the book is found to be neither amusing or instructive    Wave Surge Billow  Waves  are the natural effect of the fluidity of a running water they are as applicable to rivers as the sea and leave  the idea of a calm  Surges  are applied properly to the sea only imply swol'n waves and mark a small degree of agitation  Billows  proceed from a more violent motion consequently denote a greater agitation they break into white foam and are attended with no little roar  We cut through the  waves  are lifted by the  surges  tossed and dashed by the  billows  The life of some men may be aptly compared to the sharpkeeled vessel cutting through the  waves  leaving no noise or track behind it while that of others may be represented as tossed up and down on the windswoln  surges  of a boisterous fortune or dashed in pieces by the foaming  billows  of adversity    Uproar Tumult Riot  Uproar  conveys an idea of some great noise  tumult  and  riot  of some great disorder  The diference between the words  tumult  and  riot  is that  tumult  implies the rising of many people  riot  the disturbance of a few whereas an  uproar  may be occasioned by one single person  Tumults  and  riots  are always attended with such  uproars  as give umbrage to a peaceable neighbourhood  Houses of debauchery are subject to  riots  a  tumult  often happens in illpoliced cities    Inclination Propension Bias  These three words rise gradually  inclination  implying some thing less strong  than  propension propension  than  bias  the first leads us to an object the second draws us the third drags us  Inclination  is greatly owing to education  propension  to custom  bias  to constitution  Choice of company is essential to the education of youth because at that age they imbibe easily the  inclinations  of those whose company they keep It is a dangerous thing to give a loose to any one vice as frequent commission is apt to create strong  propension  Persons of warm constitutions have a natural  bias  to venery  Inclination  is generally applied to good objects  propension  to bad Thus we say the charitable man is ever  inclined  to assist his neighbour So deprayed is human nature that we have always a  propension  to vice  Of two persons to be served a foreigner and a countryman we are generally  biassed  in favour of the last    Should Ought Is necessary  The first of these expressions implys more precisely an obligation of complaisance custom or personal interest thus we  should  not offend the company we are in we  should  follow the fashion we  should  know a man before we trust him The second denotes more particularly an obligation of reason and good sense thus we  ought  in every thing to give up to those who know better than ourselves we  ought  to serve them who have served us The third is more used to express an essential and indispensable obligation thus it  is necessary  to love God in order to be saved It  is necessary  to be complaisant to please    Furthermore Moreover Besides  Furthermore  is properly used when there is need only to add one more reason to those beforementioned its intent is to multiply and it has no relation but to number  Moreover  is in its right place when used to add a reason of a different kind to those that went before its chief office is to add with a particular respect to diversity  Besides  is used with propriety when we would strengthen by a new reason the force of those that were sufficient of themselves its principal office is to enhance by abundance  For a state to support itself those who govern should be moderate those who ought to obey governable  furthermore  the laws should be judicious There will always be war among men because they are naturally ambitious and are governed by interest  moreover  zeal for religion makes them rigid Holy Scripture teaches us the unity of the Godhead and reason  points it out to us  besides  all nature makes us perceive it  To  Manifest Publish Proclaim  These three words imply open declaration but that of  manifest  seems to convey a proof of what is made known meaning to shew incontestably  Publish  denotes only a simple declaration but general to  proclaim  is to make known by a formal and legal publication  When once a man has lost his name let him  manifest  his good character as much as possible he will find it difficult to recover the good opinion of mankind for prejudice is blind even to the most visible truths He who  publishes  to the world the failings of another betrays in himself a want of humanity and is sure to meet with the contempt of every thinking man A famous Sultan of Egypt left to posterity a most remarkable testimony of the vanity of earthly grandeur for on his  deathbed he commanded that his winding sheet should be carried at the end of a lance by a herald who was to  proclaim  here is all that this great prince will carry out of the world with him of his wealth dignity and dominion that he enjoyed upon earth  Manifestos  of a state are usually  published  by formal  proclamation  To  Tell Disclose Reveal  To  Divulge Discover  To make known that which is unknown is the common signification of those words but to  tell  is to declare things purposely with a design to inform those we would not have remain ignorant To  disclose  is to shew either by design or inadvertency that which was before concealed To  reveal  is to lay open a secret to  divulge  is to do the same abroad To  discover  is the declaring a person to have done a thing which he would not have been thought the author of  So great an itch have some persons for prattling that they  tell  every individual thing they hear Confidents too often  disclose  the intrigues they are entrusted with Confessors  reveal  sometimes by their imprudence the confession of penitents The  divulging  of a secret has often done more harm than any other one thing whatever as it is impossible to smother what once has been blazed abroad If we would not be  discovered  we should be careful to have no witness of our actions    Equivocation Ambiguity Doubleentendre  Equivocation  has two senses the one natural in which we would have what we say understood and in which the hearer does absolutely understand us the other perverted understood only by the person speaking  Ambiguity  has one general sense susceptible of different interpretations it always creates a difficulty in getting at the true sense of the author and sometimes  an impossibility The  doubleentendre  a french word lately naturalized has two natural and apt significations one of which presents itself to the common understanding of all the world and by the other is made a fine allusion understood but by certain persons  These three ways of speaking are upon occasion ingenious methods of concealing one's true meaning but we make use of an  equivocation  to deceive of an  ambiguity  to keep in the dark from all and of a  doubleentendre  to conceal from some  It is beneath the character of an honest man to make frequent use of  equivocations  he that does being sure to meet with the contempt of mankind  Ambiguities  are perhaps oftener the effect of a confusion of ideas than a studied design of keeping people in the dark we ought never to use them but when an elucidation would be dangerous Malice and politeness have introduced the  doubleentendre  but it should never be used at the expence of our neighbours reputation    Great Big Large  The word  great  is a general term signifying any thing considerable either in bulk extent quality number c thus we say a  great  house a  great  road a  great  weight a  great  many a  great  famine a  great  happiness The words  big  and  large  are more circumscribed  big  implies greatness of bulk  large  greatness of extent Thus we say a  big  man a  big  stone but a  large  room a  large  field  A  large  man is as great an impropriety as a  big  field and we need only mention a  big  or  large  pleasure to shew the absurdity    Grave Serious Staid  We are  staid  through discretion and custom  grave  thro' humour and constitution  serious  thro' taste and affectation  Levity is the reverse of being  staid  vivacity of  gravity  wantonness of  seriousness  Aconstant round of business and continual transaction of affairs make us  staid  reflections on our latter end give  gravity  the desire of being thought  grave seriousness    Genius Talent  These are both born with us and are a happy disposition of nature by which we are qualified for some peculiar employment but  genius  seems to be more internal and possessed of the powers of invention  talent  more external and capable of execution  Thus we have a  genius  for poetry and painting but a  talent  for speaking and writing  Such as have a  genius  for mechanics may have no  talent  for watchmaking    People Persons  The word  people  is so very general that it cannot be connected with a determinate number as for instance four five or six  people  but that of  persons  may  To be pleasant at table none should be admitted but  people  of good humour neither should there be more than seven or eight  persons  In order to describe a company we should know the quality of the  people  and the number of  persons  present  In all governments we find illaffected  people  and there are always among a number some discontented  persons  To  Regard Concern Touch  We say very indifferently without much choice that a thing  regards  us  concerns  us or  touches  us to mark the part we bear in it There nevertheless appears to me to be a delicate distinction between these three expressions each rising gradually above the other according to the rank in which I have placed them Tho' we have the least part imaginable in a thing it may be said to  regard  us to  concern  us we must have a greater but when we are sensibly affected by it it may be said to  touch  us It seems also that the word  regard  is more applicable when our interest is in question that of  concern  when speaking of things committed to our care and conduct that of  touch  when it respects our honour of fortune  The illbehaviour of a servant to a customer  regards  the master as it affects his interest The least disturbance in Europe in some measure  regards  every state  it being difficult for any of them to keep a perfect neutrality for any length of time while the others are at war All the operations of government  concern  the first minister It  concerns  a man to be punctual in the discharge of his duty The conduct of a wife  touches  the husband so close that he ought to have an eye over all she does The behaviour of an ambassador  touches  always more or less the honour of the prince the represents  Many people make themselves uneasy at that which does not in the least  regard  them meddle with what no ways  concerns  them and at the same time are indifferent to those things which  touch  them nearly    Tranquillity Peace Quiet  These words let them be applied either to the soul to a republic or any particular society express equally a situation exempt from trouble and molestation  but  tranquillity  relates to that within oneself and in the time present independent of any other relation  peace  to the situation with regard to enemies in whose power it is to make an alteration  quiet  with respect to time past or future as succeeding or preceding a situation troubled  Uneasy people have no  tranquillity  in their families Litigious persons are hardly ever at  peace  with their neighbours After a troublesome time we enjoy a  quiet  state with greater satisfaction  What a state of  tranquillity  does the religious man enjoy no outward things having the power to rufflle or discompose him To preserve  peace  we should keep ourselves always in a state of defence It is indulgence only that will establish  quiet  in a mutinous people    Temple Church  Both these words signify an edifice set apart for the public service of religion  but that of  temple  is a more pompous expression and less in use than  church  with respect to the Pagan religion we frequently use the word  temple  as the  temple  of Apollo the  temple  of Janus but with relation to our own seldom St Paul's  church  St Saviour's  church  Temple  seems to express something more august and signifies properly and edifice dedicated to the deity  Church  something more common signifying particularly an edifice erected for the congregation of the faithful  The grandeur of Solomon's  temple  was beyond description Nothing profane ought to enter the  temple  of the Lord The present thinness of our  churches  is a manifest sign of a decrease in religion Nothing ought to be permitted in  church  that does not contributed to the edification of christians    Huge Vast Enormous Immense  The common idea of these words is something greatly beyond the usual measure but those of  huge  and  vast  relate more to such things as are material those of  enormous  and  immense  to such as are ideal with this difference between them that  huge  implies greatness in bulk  vast  greatness in extent  enormous  greatness in size even to deformity and dreadfulness  immense  unlimited extent even beyond expression Thus we say a  huge  giant a  vast  tract of land an  enormous  crime the  immense  expanse  There are some promontories so  huge  as to shock the eye that views them The desarts of Arabia are so  vast  that unless travellers carried their lodging and provision with them they would perish before they reached their journey's end The sins of the presumptuous wretch are so  enormous  that he can have little hopes of salvation but in the infinite mercies of an allgracious God So great is the  immensity  of the Godhead as to exceed the utmost stretch of human thought    Way Road  Way  is much more extensive and general than  road  and implies the passage from place to place whether through the high  road  or not  road  is much more limited and particular and means the beaten way of travellers from one town or city to another Which says the traveller is our best  way  to Hampton the Hounslow  road  or Kingston either  road  says his guide is good but when we come to Twittenham the shortest  way  is across the fields tho' the pleasantest  way  would be to go by water  As the word  way  is often used to signify means which when considered as the intermediate step to attainment is not widely different from that of  road  when we would adopt the figure of travelling not to confuse our ideas we generally make use of the word  road  thus diligence  with perseverance is the high  road  to preferment yet notwithstanding  way  is a much more elegant expression a strict adherence to the principles of christianity is the direct  way  to heaven    Ways Means  We go the  ways  we use the  means  Ways  are the methods we take  means  what we put in execution to succeed The first word enfolds in its idea honour and probity the last pays little or no regard but to the end aimed at Thus good  ways  are those which are just good  means  those which are sure  Simoniacal practices are very bad  ways  but very good  means  of obtaining benefices  I cannot avoid here taking notice of the ingrammatical impropriety of annexing the singular number to the word  means  the fault almost of every speaker and writer liberality say they is  a  sure  means  of becoming popular there  is  no better  means  of keeping in with the world than that of passing by affronts with composureGlaring absurdity since the word  means  is evidently plural and it would be much more elegant was the false concord avoided    Often Frequently  One relates to the repetition of the same acts the other to a plurality of objects We  often  disguise our thoughts by doing the same thing  often  it becomes habitual We  frequently  meet with traitors we  frequently  do those things which we repent of afterwards  There are two other words bearing an equal signification with  often viz oft  and  oftentimes  but they being no more than the same word abbreviated and lengthened it is needless to take any further notice of them    Cannot Impossible  One of these words more properly relates to inability the other to impossibility  We  cannot  serve two masters It is  impossible  to execute two opposite orders at the same time  We  cannot  love one by whom we have been injured It is  impossible  to love one to whom we have a natural aversion    Glory Honour  Glory  expresses something more singular than  honour  The one makes us undertake voluntarily the most difficult things the other leads us willingly to the execution of the most rigorous exactions  Quest of  glory  sometimes stimulates the soldier's courage even to rashness and notions  of  honour  in spite of fear keep him often to his duty  An indifference to  glory  may pass unnoticed but not so with respect to  honour  It is customary in conversation to place interest in opposition to  glory  and inclination to  honour  thus we say an author who labours after  glory  takes more pains in the completion of his piece than he who works merely for interest and when an avaritious man lays out his money it is more through  honour  than inclination    World Universe  World  conveys only an idea of one single being though general that which exists  Universe  an idea of many beings or rather that of all parts of the world all that exists the first of these words is sometimes used in the literal sense as when we say the old and new  world  and sometimes in a figurative as when we say in this  world  and in the other the wicked  world  the polite  world  the second is always used according to  the letter and in a sense that excepts no one thing it is for this reason when we would express the  universe  by the term  world  that we are obliged to put the word  all  before it which we have no occasion to do by  universe  for example we should say the sun warms  all  the  world  and is the heat of the  universe    Answer Reply  The  answer  is made to a demand or a question asked the  reply  to an answer or a remonstrance  Academics are taught first to start difficulties and then to  answer  them It is nobler to hear a wise remonstrance and profit by it than make any  reply  The word  answer  is more extensive in its signification than  reply  we  answer  the questions of those who ask us the demands of such as expect our services the examination of counsel the arguments of disputants the letters we receive and  for all our conduct The word  reply  is far more limited it supposes a dispute commenced from difference of sentiment we  reply  to the answer of an author whose works we have criticised to the reprimands of those whose correction we are unwilling to submit to to pleaders to an answer in chancery  An  answer  should be clear true and dictated by reason and good sense a  reply  strong and convincing armed by truth and strengthened by experience  We should teach children as much as possible to give nice and judicious  answers  and convince them that there is more honour in listning than in making  replies  to those who have the goodness to instruct them    Danger Hazard Risk Venture  All these words imply chance of harm but that of  danger  relates to the evil that may happen those of  hazard risk  and  venture  to the good we may lose with  this difference that  hazard  expresses something near  risk  something at a distance  venture  something farther off relating only to the possibility of events Hence those expressions in  danger  of death in  hazard  of our life by giving a loose to debauchery we  risk  our health nothing  venture  nothing have  Danger  creates fear  hazard  alarm  risk  caution but we often  venture  with the greatest satisfaction  The avaritious man spurred on by interest fears no  danger hazards  his health and happiness runs every  risk  that attends his profession and gladly ventures his all in search of that which if obtained he would not have the spirit to enjoy    Against In spite of  Both these denote opposition but the expression  in spite of  implies more resolution and greater force than the word  against against  supposing little or no resistance  in the object opposed but  in spite of  a considerable struggle  We act  against  the will or  against  rule and  in spite of  oppositions  The good man does nothing  against  the dictates of his conscience The wicked man commits sin  in spite of  the punishment annexed to it  Rashness will attempt things  against  all appearance of success and resolution will pursue the attempt  in spite of  all the obstacles it meets with    Boldness Audaciousness Impudence Effrontery  There is a commendable  holdness  that proceeds from a selfconsciousness of worth but the  holdness  which is here meant springs from ignorance is brazen and presuming  Audaciousness  is a greater degree of  boldness  such as is steeled against reproof is rude and noisy  Impudence  consists in being an utter stranger to all kind of modesty is scurrilous and abusive  Effrontery  proceeds from pride and  selfsufficiency is overbearing and insolent  The  bold  are unawed by diffidence they speak with great assurance neither the quality or rank of those they address being able to disconcert them The more you reprove the  audacious  man the more it hardens him he wilfully forgets the respect due to his superiors and idly imagines his boisterous behaviour a distinguishing mark of manhood The weapons of the  impudent  are sauciness and abuse which they take up at every turn and with which they lay about them in a most unmerciful manner As great a cause of  effrontery  as any is the want of education he whom it possesses is arrogant and insolent a stranger to goodsense and unacquainted with the rules of goodbreeding    Profitable Advantageous Beneficial  Profitable  is more applicable to gain  Advantageous  to honour or any kind of convenience  beneficial  to health  Some kinds of merchandise are far more  profitable  than others A good name is very  advantageous  as it serves to push us forward in the world Loss of blood to a feverish person is very  beneficial  Light  profits  make a heavy purse A seasonable word spoke in favour is freuently of more  advantage  than the greatest services The greatest  benefit  to the soul is a sincere repentance  To  See Look at  To  Behold View  We  see  whatever strikes the sight we  look at  an object when we designedly cast our eye upon it we  behold  it when we look with attention we  view  it when we survey it  We  see  all objects before our eyes we  look at  those which excite our curiosity we  behold  such as cause our admiration we  view  those we are desirous to examine  We  see  distinctly or confusedly We  look at  near or at a distance We  behold  with wonder and attention We  view  with care and exactness  The eyes open to  see  turn to  look at  fix themselves to  behold  and move all ways to  view  The connoisseur in painting  looks at  the first picture he  sees  if it be the work of a celebrated artist he  beholds  it with pleasure and  views  every part of it with the greatest minuteness  To  Stare Gaze  Though the common meaning of these words is to fix both the eyes upon an object and look at it with wonder intently and earnestly yet there is a great difference between them  staring  implies looking with wonder and impudence  gazing  with wonder and respect  The impudence of some fellows is so great that they will  stare  a modest woman out of countenance  A man in love will sometimes  gaze  upon the object of his affections till he almost loses his sight  When our Saviour first appeared to his disciples after his resurrection they  gazed  on him with astonishment and rapture  To  stare  another in the face has always been considered as a breach of good manners    Useful Serviceable  As nearly synonymous as these words may appear to be there is yet a manifest difference between them but the distinction is so delicate as to require some attention to discover it  Useful  in my opinion is more applicable to things in use to those we have often recourse to and what cannot be well done without  Serviceable  to things of service such as we oftener do without than with and such as we little expect to have Thus furniture is  useful  memorandum books to persons engaged in a multiplicity of Business are  useful  Friends and good connections are  serviceable  The plummet is so  useful  to the carpenter that to fix a perpendicular without it would give him a great deal of trouble Of all animals a horse is the most  serviceable  To those who take snuff a box is extremely  useful  but its contents very far from  serviceable    Gulph Abyss  What these words should express is rather imaginary than real they are generally used therefore in a figurative sense we are supposed to be swallowed up by a  gulph  and lost in an  abyss  The first carries with it an idea of insatiable voracity which drags in and consumes all that approaches the second of an unmeasurable depth to whose bottom we can never get and in which we lose at the same time the sight of the place from whence we came and of that where we are going  A  gulph  is supposed to have many turns and windings of which when we have once set a step in we cannot possibly get out but are carried on in spite of all our endeavours to the contrary An  abyss  is supposed to have many uncertain and obscure roads without end in which tho' we may sometimes stoop in hopes of finding a way out yet being deceived we become disheartened bewildered with doubts and overwhelmed with despair  A loose woman is a  gulph  of woe all perishes there virtue riches and health Philosophy teaches us that man is continually wandering in an  abyss  of darkness    Determination Resolution  Determination  is an act of judgment and supposes examination  resolution  an act of the will and supposes deliberation the first shuts out suspence the last wavering  Our  determinations  should be just to avoid repentance our  resolutions  fixed to exclude variation  Nothing is more disagreeable both to ourselves and others than to be always  undetermined  in our affairs and  irresolute  in our proceedings  It is more difficult to  determine  on points of precedence than on solid and real interests  There are no weaker  resolutions  than those made at confession or on a sickbed the first return of health carrying us again into the same course of life  We may be  determined  and yet not  resolved  that is we may come to some decision and still not be so far  resolved  as to put that decision into execution fear timidity or some other motive may prevent us  The  determinations  of women are seldom better grounded than on whimsey or caprice Men are so often led by taste and custom that their  resolutions  are generally vain  In science we say the  determination  of a point the  resolution  of a difficulty  The more we  determine  the less we prove Though in the schools we answer every difficulty we  resolve  but few    Old Ancient Antique  These words rise one upon the other  antique  upon  ancient  and that of  ancient  upon  old  A fashion is  old  when it ceases to be in use  ancient  when its use has been sometime past  antique  when it has been a long time  ancient  That which is recent is not  old  that which is new is not  ancient  that which is modern is not  antique  Oldness  agrees best with age  ancientness  with the origin of families  antiquity  with what existed in former times  As we grow  old  we decrease in strength but gain more experience  Ancientness  makes fashions disagreeable but adds splendour to nobility  Antiquity  destroys the proofs of history and weakens credit but renders monuments of greater value    General Universal  General  implies a great number of particulars  universal  every particular  The government of princes has no object in view but the  general  good The providence of God is  universal  An orator speaks in  general  when he makes no particular application Knowledge is  universal  when it knows every thing  Christianity is  generally  known and believed but not  universally    Word Term Expression  Nothing is more common than an indiscriminate use of these words and yet none differ more among themselves A  word  is a single part of speech is general and determined by use  Term  is a  particular cast of language owes its formation to the subject and its excellence to its suitableness  Expression  is a certain mode of speech rises from thought and is more or less beautiful according to its particular turn  The purity of language depends upon its  words  the precision upon its  terms  and brilliancy upon its  expressions  Elaborate discourses require the  words  to be truly English the  terms  proper and the  expressions  noble  A  word  which has escaped us undesignedly sometimes has been attended with fatal consequences  Terms  of art are now pretty generally known however they appear with little grace except in the mouths of the professors of those arts Starched or farfetched  expressions  carry with them an air of pedantry    Pile Heap  These words equally signify a quantity of things together one upon another  with this difference that  pile  rather means things put up regularly whereas  heap  implies no other order in the arrangement than what rises from chance As a  pile  of wood a  heap  of rubbish  We say a  pile  of bricks when they are the materials prepared for building and a  heap  of bricks when they are the remains of a fallen edifice    Departure Death Decease  Departure  is a stile more refined and carries with it an idea of the passage from one life to another  death  more common and signifies precisely extinction of life  decease  more studied is a term somewhat bordering upon the law and implies the refuge of mortality The second of these words is made use of with respect to all sorts of animals the other two to man only  A glorious  departure  is preferable to a shameful life  Death  is the common lot  of all things living Succession does not take place 'till the moment of  decease  Departure  presents nothing horrid to the imagination it indicates something agreeable in eternity  decease  conveys only an idea of trouble in being separated from things we are much attached to but  death  presents something dreadful and affrighting    Value Worth  Value  rises from the intrinsic goodness of things  worth  from the estimation of them  Of two things the best is the most  valuable  and that  worth  most that bears the greatest price    Valley Bottom Vale Dale  Of these four words  valley  implies a narrow space situated between two hills  bottom  a like space but quaggy and disagreeable  Vale  signifies a space more extended whereas  dale  means rather low lands  The words  dale  and  vale  are oftener found in poetry  valley  and  bottom  in prose  Valleys  are for the most part winding and as they receive water from the hills on each side are generally converted into meads He whose house stands in a  bottom  cannot live on a more unhealthy spot A fine  vale  with beautiful enclosures bounded by rising woods is a delightful prospect  Dales  are much easier to be ploughed than hilly lands    Head Chief  The word  head  is reckoned synonymous only to  chief  when used in a figurative sense but even then it requires a different application  Head  agrees best with respect to arrangement  chief  with regard to subordination Thus we say the  head  of a batallion or a ship the  chief  of a party or an undertaking  A commander in  chief  is generally at the  head  of his troops    Impediment Obstacle Obstruction  There seems to be a gradation in these words The  impediment  stays the  obstacle  resists the  obstruction  puts an entire stop to  We say remove the  impediment  surmount the  obstacle  take away or vanquish the  obstruction  Even small  impediments  sometimes prove such  obstacles  as  obstruct  our best endeavours  The word  impediment  seems to express something rising from the nature and proper circumstances of what we are about that of  obstacle  something from a foreign cause that of  obstruction  something proceeding from a superior force  Every temptation may be said to  impede  our resolutions to virtue The eloquence of Demosthenes was the greatest  obstacle  that Philip of Macedon found in all his political undertakings and which he could never surmount but by force of arms Nearness of kin is an  obstruction  to marriage which the laws have made and which those laws only can take away    Learning Literature Erudition  Of all order of words there does not appear a more regular climax than in the above three which seems to be compleated by the word KNOWLEDGE but as that has never been accounted synonymous with these I shall take no notice of it here  Learning  implies simply that knowledge which we acquire by our common study at school  Literature  denotes polite learning or an acquaintance with the BELLES LETTRES and is rather practical  but  erudition  signifies great depth of knowledge with a particular relation to that which is speculative  Without some degree of  learning  'tis impossible to pass well through the world There was a time when the nobility piqued themselves on being men of  literature  A taste for  erudition  will furnish infinite amusement for a tranquil and retired life  To  Inquire Interrogate Ask  We  inquire  we  interrogate  we  ask  in order to know but the verb  inquire  implies curiosity that of  interrogate  authority that of  ask  something more civil and respectful  The words  inquire  and  interrogate  make sense by themselves but to use the word  ask  with propriety we must add the matter to it that is to make the sense perfect we must mention the thing we  ask  'Tis the business of a spy to make  enquiries  Criminals are  interrogated  by the judge The soldier  asks  orders from the commanding officer  To  Shun Avoid Fly  We  shun  those persons whom we would not see or by whom we would not be seen We  avoid  doing things that are disagreeable to us We  fly  both persons and things which we fear and dread  In the words  shun  and  avoid  which seem to have the nearest affinity to each other there is this standing difference that the word  shun  is generally applied to persons that of  avoid  to things  In order to  fly  we turn to the opposite side and get quick away to prevent being taken in order to  shun  we take another road getting slily away to  avoid  being seen or to escape a trap in order to  avoid  we use some extraordinary means  We  shun  troublesome company We  avoid  running into excess We  fly  those who pursue us  Knowlege of the world makes us  shun  Prudence makes us  avoid  Fear makes us  fly  The best remedy against the plague is to  fly  far from the place where it is The surest method of preserving our innocence is to  shun  bad company It is an act of the greatest weakness not to  avoid  doing those things which are detrimental to our interest    Severity Rigour  Severity  shews itself chiefly in the manner of thinking and judging it condemns readily and admits of no excuse  Rigour  is seen particularly in the manner of punishing it pardons nothing nor lightens the stroke  Falsedevotees are  severe  only to others whom they are ever eager to condemn and are always applauding their own actions  Rigour  can never be justifiable  but at those times when example is of the utmost consequence yet even then some sort of allowance should be made for human frailty  To  Succour Help  To  Assist Relieve  We make use of the word  succour  in danger  help  in labour  assist  in want  relieve  in distress The first springs from a motive of generosity the second from good nature the third from humanity the fourth from compassion  We give  succour  in battle we  help  when we carry part of another's burden we  assist  the poor and  relieve  the afflicted  The policy of states has found it necessary to  succour  each other when the power of any one of them is gaining too great a head Very extraordinary things have been done by the joint  help  of numbers Many a parent has beggar'd himself in advancing the fortune of his child tis therefore the indispensable duty of that child to  assist  his father to the utmost  of his power The truly compassionate man receives as much inward satisfaction in  relieving  the distressed as he communicates    Always Continually Perpetually  That which we do  always  we do at all times and on all occasions that which is done  continually  is done without interruption or intermission but for a time limited whereas what is done  perpetually  is done also without intermission and without any regard to time  We should  always  prefer our duty to our pleasure It is impossible to be  continually  at work The heavenly bodies are  perpetually  in motion  To please in company we should  always  talk well but not  continually  The longitude may be discovered by  perpetual  motion    Diversity Variety  Diversity  supposes a change which taste is always in search of in order to discover some novelty that may enliven and delight it  variety  supposes a plurality of things differing from each other in likeness which cheers the imagination apt to be cloyed with too great a uniformity  Without some  diversity  life would be altogether insipid Nature has thrown infinite  variety  among the smallest objects which if we cannot perceive is owing to a defect of light  An agreeable  diversity  of colours will give as much pleasure to the eye as harmonious sounds to the ear  Variety  of amusements insensibly lead us into a dissipation    Difference Dispute Quarrel  Opposition of interests causes  differences  Contrariety of opinions produces  disputes  Harshness of dispositions is the source of  quarrels  We make up the  difference  We end the  dispute  We appease the  quarrel  Envy and covetousness make sometimes great  differences  for trifles Prejudice and want of attention to what is said commonly prolong  disputes Quarrels  for the most part proceed more from disposition than animosity    Ill Sick  These two words are considered only as synonymous when they imply afflicted with disease but as indiscriminately as they may be used even in that sense still they convey different ideas marking different degrees of illness The word  ill  in my opinion is used with most propriety when health is the least impaired that of  sick  when the body is greatly diseased Thus we say when we find a heaviness upon the spirits or a want of appetite  that we are  ill  but when the whole frame of any one is disordered we naturally say he is  sick  When we apply either of these words to ourselves they carry very different meanings thus I am  ill  is general and implies disordered in any part of the body whereas I am  sick  is particular and means disordered in the stomach  There is yet a further distinction between them  Ill  is most applicable when in pain only  sick  when diseased thus we say he is  ill  of the gout but  sick  of a fever    Disease Distemper Sickness  Disease  and  distemper  imply particular disorders with this difference that  disease  is more applicable to man  distemper  to brutes whereas  sickness  is more general and may be applied to either  Diseases  such as the plague fevers c are sometimes so epidemical as to  lay waste more than the sword  Distempers  among cattle are generally infectious Divine displeasure hath often shewn itself by a general  sickness  among men and beasts  Both  diseases  and  distempers  when become universal are  sicknesses  so severe as draw the joint prayers of a people in hopes to avert them    Weary Tired Fatigued  It is the continuation of the same thing that either  wearies  or  tires  with this difference that  weary  implies a less degree  tired  a greater but it is labour that  fatigues  We grow  weary  or  tired  with standing We are  fatigued  with work  When we are  weary  of a thing to complete it we lack spirits when  tired  we are totally unable when  fatigued  we want strength to go through it as we would  Weariness  proceeds sometimes from an unwillingness in what we undertake we are frequently  tired  through disposition of body and slow circulation of blood but  fatigue  is always the consequence of much action it supposes excess of work with respect either to difficulty or length of time  In a figurative sense a petitioner grows  weary  through his impatience  tired  thro' his perseverance and  fatigued  through his importunities  We are  weary  with waiting  tired  with illsuccess and  fatigued  with pursuing  Thus may we be  weary  and not  tired tired  yet not  fatigued    Light Brightness Splendor  Light  is the origin or commencement of  brightness splendor  is  brightness  in perfection  The intention of  light  is only to make objects visible that of  brightness  to make them clearly distinguishable and known  splendor  shews them to the greatest degree of perfection  It is  light  at daybreak  bright  in the morning  splendid  at noon  We attribute  light  to the stars  brightness  to the moon and  splendor  to the sun    Lustre Brilliancy Radiancy  These three words as the last rise gradually one upon another and mark the different degrees of the effect of light  Lustre  seems to be possessed of polish only  brilliancy  of light but  radiancy  of fire  Lustre  shines only  brilliancy  dazzles but  radiancy  glares  We seldom make use of the word  lustre  but in the literal sense whereas we frequently use that of  radiancy  and  much more often that of  brilliancy  in the figurative Considered then in this sense it appears to me that it is the force of truth the energy of language and the newness of the thoughts that give  radiancy  to a discourse whereas  brilliancy  rises from the beautiful turns and lively touches of expression and that it is the choice of words the agreement of terms and the arrangement of phrases that give a  lustre  to what is said    Wisdom Prudence  Wisdom  makes us act and speak properly  prudence  prevents our speaking or acting improperly The first in order to attain its ends searches out the best paths to follow the second that it may not miss its aim tries to discover the bad ways in order to avoid them  Wisdom  is more knowing  prudence  more wary  The  wise  man makes use of those means that are most proper for his purpose he conducts himself by the light of reason The  prudent  man takes those ways he thinks most sure he does not venture into places unknown  An ancient writer has said that it is a mark of  wisdom  not to talk on any subject but what we are thorough masters of especially if we would be esteemed we may add to this maxim that it is a piece of  prudence  not to bring a disagreeable subject on the tapis particularly if we are desirous of being beloved  To  Find Meet with  We  find  things unknown or which we sought after We  meet with  things that are in our way or which present themselves to us unsought for  The unfortunate  find  always some resource in their misfortunes People who  readily unite themselves with all the world are liable to  meet with  bad company    Union Joining  Union  relates particularly to two different things which agree together  Joining  respects properly two distant things which draw near together one after the other  The word  union  carrys with it an idea of agreement and fitness that of  joining  seems to suppose some kind of motion  We say the  union  of colours and the  joining  of armies the  union  of two neighbours and the  joining  of two rivers  That which is not  united  is divided that which is not  joined  is separated  We  unite  in order to form a society We  join  for the sake of company  Union  is often used in a figurative sense but  joining  only in the literal  Union  is the support of families and the power of states The  joining  of many streams forms great rivers    Situation Condition State  The words  situation  and  condition  imply something accidental and transitory with this difference that  situation  respects outward circumstances  condition  those within the matter referred to whereas that of  state  implies something more habitual and lasting  We generally use the word  situation  as relative to affairs rank or fortune  condition  with respect to the nature quality or property of a thing and that of  state  applying it to health or our well or illbeing  We say our  situation  is bad when we are surrounded with difficulties that a building is in bad  condition  when out  of repair and that some persons enjoy but an indifferent  state  of health  An ill  state  of health added to a bad  situation  of affairs is a  condition  into which every man must naturally dread the falling  Such is the  condition  and vicissitude of human life that the most prudent men have often found themselves in perplexing  situations  and from a  state  of happiness have as it were through the perverseness of fortune fallen into one most wretched and deplorable    Of Fashion Of Quality  As synonymous as these expressions may be in the mouths of those who use them they still imply particular characters in their right signification when we are obliged on certain occasions to express ourselves properly The last of these expressions rises upon the first and signifies the nobility whereas by the other is only understood the gentry  The pride and folly of the world is grown to so great a pitch that persons in trade are continually apeing people of  offashion  and those  offashion  people  ofquality    Notes Remarks Observations  Notes  imply a shortness and precision  remarks  a choice and distinction  observations  something critical and farfetched  Notes  are often necessary  remarks  are sometimes useful  observations  should be always learned  Change of manners and customs for the most part render authors in want of  notes  There are as good  remarks  perhaps to be made upon the moderns as upon the ancients Historical  observations  make antiquity more known  To  Take Receive Accept  We  take  what is given us We  receive  what is sent us We  accept  what is offered us  We  take  money we  receive  favours we  accept  services  To  accept  implys always consent and approbation to  receive  does not to  take  excludes only refusal  No man should ever  take  more than his due We should always acknowledge those civilities we have  received  What we have once  accepted  should never afterwards be rejected    Sentiment Opinion Thought  These words are all in use when the bare expression only of ideas is in question In this fense  sentiment  is more certain it is a belief raised by solid or apparent reasons  opinion  is more doubtful it is a judgement built on some foundation  Thought  is still less certain springing only from conjecture  The word  sentiment  is used with more propriety when the subject is on taste That Homer is an excellent poet is the  sentiment  of every man of learning The word  opinion  agrees best when talking of science It is the general  opinion  that the sun is the centre of the world The word  thought  is more particularly in use when we are judging of the event of things or the actions of men Politicians have long  thought  that the Moscovians would find a greater advantage from Asia than from Europe  Sentiments  are in some measure guided by the influence of the heart we often find them in favour of those persons we love  Opinions  are frequently owing to prejudice it is common for scholars to have good ones for their masters  Thoughts  rise greatly from imagination they are often chimerical    Resolution Courage Valour Bravery Intrepidity  Resolution  either banishes fear or surmounts it it will not admit a falling back but is staunch on all occasions  Courage  is impatient to attack it undertakes boldly and is not lessened by difficulty  Valour  acts with vigour it gives no way to resistance but pursues its enterprize in spite of opposition  Bravery  knows no fear it runs nobly into danger and prefers honour to life itself  Intrepidity  encounters the greatest perils with the utmost coolness and dares even present death  The three first of these words seem more relative to action than the two last and the two last seem to imply a greater fearfulness of danger than the three first  Resolution  supports us in action  Courage  makes us advance  Valour  makes us execute Through  bravery  we expose ourselves to danger We would sacrifice ourselves through  intrepidity  Resolution  should never desert us  courage  should always determine us to do right  valour  would never make us despise the enemy  bravery  should not pride itself in opposition nor should  intrepidity  shew itself but in cases of duty or necessity    Angry In a Passion Passionate  An impatient agitation or rising of the blood against any one who has offended us is the common import of the two first of these terms The word  angry  implies a passion more internal and lasting whereas the expression  in a passion  carries in its idea a sudden external gust of anger short but violent  Anger  shall sometimes brood in the breast for years till at last it becomes as it were fixed and settled sometimes it will dissemble for a long while together but often finds it extremely difficult to pardon On the contrary it is the general characteristic of those who are  in a passion  to forgive as soon as it subsides which may perhaps be the next quarter of an hour besides the man  in a passion  cannot dissemble his violence of  anger  must have vent when that's obtained he is as cool as before indeed his  passion  will now and then settle into confirmed  anger  but when that is the case it is generally owing to repeated offences  With respect to the word  passionate  there is a wide difference between the man  in a passion  and the  passionate  man the one being extraordinary the other ordinary  Few men for example can avoid being  in a passion  when they are greatly offended but  passionate  people are heated on the most trifling occasions    Hasty Passionate  According to my conception it appears that  hasty  relates more to action or blows and that  passionate  goes seldom farther than words  A  hasty  man is apt to lift his hand it is generally with him a word and a blow A  passionate  man will vent his anger in words only  We should be upon our guard when with  hasty  people and have patience with the  passionate    Strong Robust Stout Sturdy  Strength  is chiefly owing to the construction of the muscles A little man is often  stronger  than a greater  Robustness  carries with it an idea of lustiness is less subject to infirmities and much owing to constitution A short man may be  robust  By  stout  we understand tall and strongmade A little man tho' never so  strong  cannot be called  stout  By  sturdy  we mean  stout  with a degree of hardiness  Strength  gives a man an advantage over his enemies  robustness  lends him an air of dignity and authority  stoutness  makes him admired  sturdiness  is accompanied with an air of meanness    Complaisant Polite Wellbred  Complaisance  rises from the respect we shew those whom we meet is sometimes sincere sometimes not  politeness  from the flattering methods we make use of in our behaviour and conversation and is generally insincere but to be  wellbred  is to shew the same honours always with sincerity  Complaisance  is the characteristic of the lover  politeness  of the courtier but to be  wellbred  denotes the gentleman  We should be  complaisant  without importunity and  polite  without insipidity The distinguishing mark of a  wellbred  man is the constant care he takes never to disgust or offend    Humpbacked Crocked Deformed  The true meaning of the word  humpbacked  is having a rising upon the back owing either to  crookedness  or some other cause and may be either natural or accidental tho' the words  crooked  and  deformed  convey other ideas still nothing is more common than to find them frequently in use to express the same as  humpbacked  By  crookedness  is understood any deviation from natural straitness  Deformity  implies any part of the body being imperfect or unnatural Thus a man is  crooked  if any ways twisted or bent from the natural shape and  deformed  if he has an eye a finger or a toe too little or too much We may be  humpbacked  or  crooked  by a fall or some other accident but  deformed  we cannot be otherwise than by a defect or exuberance in nature  A man may be  deformed  and not  crooked crooked  yet not  hump backed    Perfect Finished Complete  Perfection  regards properly the beauty which rises from the design and construction of the work  finishing  from the workmanship and hand of the workman  Completion  depends upon the want of nothing but on the work's having every thing it should have The first excludes all sorts of defect The second shews a particular care and attention to the minutest article The third respects more the totality of parts  We may easily make a thing  complete  and with much pains  finish  it but after all it may not be  perfect    Misfortune Disaster Calamity  Each of these words denotes a sad event but that of  misfortune  is applied to  casualties and outward circumstances things detached from us  Disaster  respects properly personal accidents  Calamity  implies something more general  It is a  misfortune  to lose our money or our friend It is a  disaster  to fall or be wounded It is a  calamity  to find ourselves suddenly disgraced and ruined in the world  We say a great  misfortune  a shocking  disaster  and a dreadful  calamity  Misfortunes  will happen to the best of men We bring  disasters  frequently upon ourselves thro' want of proper care  Calamities  are often sent by heaven upon the wicked to rouse them from their sinful lethargy  To  Consent Acquiesce Agree  We  consent  to the will of others by permitting We  acquiesce  in what is proposed by conforming We  agree  to what is said by approving  We naturally oppose what we do not  consent  to discourage what we will not  acquiesce  in and dispute what we cannot  agree  to  It appears to me that the word  consent  supposes some authority in the person  consenting  that of  acquiesce  some submission in the person  acquiescing  and that the word  agree  denotes some aversion to dispute  Parents  consent  to the marriage of their children Parties  acquiesce  in the decree of a judge Wellbred persons  agree  almost to every thing    Management Direction Administration Conduct Government  Management  respects only private things trusted to the care of some one to employ for the profit of another and to whom he is to render an account as that of a clerk to his master  Direction  relates to certain affairs where there is a distribution either of money office or whatever  else is committed to the care of another to preserve necessary order  Administration  refers to objects of greater consequence such as those of justice or the finances of a state it supposes a preeminence of employ which gives power credit and a kind of liberty in the department the person is engaged in  Conduct  points out some knowledge and ability with respect to things and a subordination with regard to persons  Government  results from authority and dependance it indicates a superiority of office with a particular relation to policy  Whosoever has the  management  of any one's concerns in trust should be as attentive and as careful as if they were his own He who undertakes the  direction  of public charities should divest himself of all prejudice and partiality A judge ought to be wisely circumspect in the  administration  of justice and a prime minister intently wary in the  administration  of public affairs No one thing should be committed to the  conduct  of another unless we are well perswaded he has abilities adequate to the task and will act in conformity to the intentions of him whose  business he undertakes The man who thro' favour of his prince is offered the helm of  government  should seriously reflect on the arduous office and not suffer his ambition to get the better of his discretion    Affront Insult Abuse  Affront  is an arrow of reproach and contempt shot in public it piques and mortifies those who have any sense of honour  Insult  is an attack made with insolence it is usually repelled with spirit Both  affronts  and  insults  may be given without words but  abuse  results chiefly from scurrilous language  Affronts  are often given through the childish itch of revenge  Insults  are too frequently the offspring of pride We seldom if ever hear  abuse  in the mouth of a wellbred man  Happy is that person that can put up  affronts  with composure bear  insults  with calmness and turn a deaf ear to  abuse    To In order to  These terms are synonymous in that sense where they signify doing one thing in view of another but the word  to  denotes a nearer view the expression  In order to  one farther off  We get introduced to a prince  to  make our court we make our court to him  in order to  obtain his favours  The word  to  seems to agree best when what we do in view of some other thing is almost certain to take effect The expression  in order to  appears to be used with most propriety when the thing we have in view may not be the immediate consequence  We fire cannon against a besieged place  to  make a breach and  in order to  take it by assault or oblige the enemy to surrender  To  respects more particularly an effect which ought to be produced  In order to  regards properly an aim which we would obtain  Young women at a certain age do all they can  to  please  in order to  procure themselves husbands    Outside Appearance  In the literal sense it is the walls the ditches the courts the gardens the avenues that forms the  outside  of a castle but it is the figures the grandeur the situation and the architecture that determines the  appearance  the  outside  being the external part of a thing the  appearance  the effect which a view of that thing produces or the idea we form of it by that view  In the figurative sense  outside  is oftner applied to our manners and our way of living  appearance  seems to be more in  use with respect to our actions and our conduct  A brilliant  outside  is no certain proof of a good fortune Going frequently to church is an  appearance  that can determine little with regard to virtue    Vision Apparition  A  vision  passes inwardly in the mind and is supposed to be only an action of the imagination An  apparition  strikes the senses outwardly and is supposed to be an object from without  Joseph was warned by a  vision  to fly into Egypt with his family Mary Magdelen was informed of the resurrection of our Saviour by an  apparition  Feverish persons often think they see  visions  Timid and credulous people sometimes take trees or posts for  apparitions  and frequently objects of their own imagination  To  See Perceive  Objects that have some duration or that shew themselves are  seen  those that pass by quickly or are hid in some measure from the eye are only  perceived  We  see  the face and by that  perceive  the disposition of the heart  In a crowded court those who stand forward are  seen  by the prince while others behind are scarcely  perceived  To  Fear  be  Apprehensive  To  Dread  be  Afraid  We  fear  an ill through a natural aversion to it and from a sense that it may happen to us we are  apprehensive  of losing a benefit through an eager desire to obtain it and from a conviction that we never may we  dread  our adversary through sentiments of esteem when we  know him our superior we are  afraid  of danger through a timid disposition  Want of courage makes us  fear  Doubt of success makes us  apprehensive  Distrust of strength makes us  dread  Imagination itself will often make us  afraid  Common people  fear  death more than any thing the Epicureans were much more in  fear  of pain but gentlemen are of opinion they ought to fear nothing so much as infamy The more ardently we wish for a thing the more we  apprehend  the losing of it Whatever merit an author may flatter himself that he has he should always  dread  the judgment of the public Women who are  afraid  of nothing but losing their reputation do honour to their sex  To  Teach Learn Instruct  To  teach  is only to give lessons to  learn  is to give lessons with success both which words relate more to those  things that are proper to cultivate the mind and form a good education for which reason we use them with propriety when the arts and sciences are in question To  instruct  has a greater relation to that which is useful in the conduct of life and success of affairs it is therefore in its proper place when speaking of any thing that concerns either our duty or our interest  Professors  teach  in public schools those who come to hear them The historian  learns  posterity the events of his times A father  instructs  his children how they ought to live in the world  It requires great knowledge to  teach  method and plainness to  learn  others experience and abilities to  instruct  Many persons attempt to  teach  what they have occasion to study themselves Some will undertake to  learn  others what they themselves are almost ignorant of Very few are capable of  instructing    Gentle Tame  Gentle  animals are naturally so  tame  ones are so partly by the art and industry of man  The dog the ox and the horse are  gentle  animals the bear and the lion are sometimes  tame  To  Bind Tie  We  bind  to prevent the limbs moving or the parts of a thing separating we  tie  to stop a thing or prevent its going any farther  We  bind  the feet and hands of a criminal and we  tie  him to a stake  In the figurative sense a man is  bound  when he is not at liberty to act and he is  tied  when he cannot change his party or quit it  Authority and power  bind  interest and love  tie  We do not think ourselves  bound  when we see not our bonds and we do not imagine ourselves  tied  when we have no occasion to use our liberty  To  Hope Expect  The first of these words has for its object success in itself and denotes a trust born up by some encouragement The second regards particularly the happy moment of event and intimates a certainty of its arriving we  hope  to obtain things we  expect  their coming  We should always  hope  for the indulgence of heaven and  expect  without murmuring the hour of Providence  What we  hope  for seems to be more a favour or a kindness what we  expect  more a duty or obligation Thus we  hope  for favourable answers to our demands and we  expect  such as are agreeable to our propositions  I  hope  my work will meet with the taste of the public and I  expect  an equitable sentence    Weight Influence Sway  Taking these words in the sense of having power over the minds of others  weight  implies prevalence tho' small  influence  seems to have more force  sway  is more absolute  Superiority of rank and reason gives  weight  it is commonly by persuasion that it acts Attachment to persons contributes much to the  influence  they have over us it is by sollicitation it prevails The art of finding out and taking advantage of the weakness of men forms the  sway  we bear over them 'tis by watching their motion that we succeed  The  weight  we have with others proceeds always from some worth in ourselves either of mind birth or fortune  Influence  is owing to some tye either of  heart or interest  Sway  rises from an ascendency arrogated by art or ceded to us thro' weakness  A person of  weight  has succeeded sometimes when arguments would have no force  Influence  on some occasions hath wrought almost miracles effecting that which money could not bring to bear  Sway  is a wonderful operator on weak minds procuring that through art which no other thing can possibly obtain  What perverseness then can possibly withstand a man of some  weight  in himself whose  influence  is great and who knows how to bear a proper  sway    Authority Power Dominion  We find in the word  authority  sufficient energy to make us perceive a right either of civil or politic administration There is in the word  power  a particular relation to the subordinate execution of  superior orders The word  dominion  carries with it an idea of empire  It is the law which gives  authority  it deriving all its might from thence  Power  is invested in delegates those to whom the execution of the laws is entrusted and is consequently in subordination to  authority Dominion  springs from the joint consent of the people or from the force of arms and is either lawful or tyrannical  We are happy in living under the  authority  of a Prince who prides himself in justice whose ministers assume no  power  beyond what is legal and who makes the welfare of his subjects the basis of his  dominion  Authority  if weak is exposed to contempt it is equally as dangerous not to make use of it on proper occasions as even to abuse it A blind  power  which acts in opposition to justice becomes odious and paves the way to its own ruin A jealous  dominion  that admits of no sharer makes itself formidable awakens on that aocount the ardor of its enemies and thus ushers in its own fall  There appears to me particularly in the idea of  authority  something just and respectable in the idea of  power  something strong and active and in the idea of  domiuion  something great and elevated  As there is none but God that has an unlimited  authority  so there is none else who has infinite  power  neither is there any absolute sovereign and independent  dominion  than his  Nature has established no  authority  among men but that of fathers over their children all other proceeds from positive right The  power  of the passions is the true spring of action and determines us with respect either to good or evil It is not only by the disposition of human laws that marriage places the woman under the  dominion  of the man but it is also so settled by the divine    Volume Book  A  volume  may contain many  books  A  book  may make many  volumes  The  binding properly distinguishes the  volumes  and the division of the work the  books  We must not always judge of the knowledge of an author by the largeness of the  volume  Works are sometimes spread out into many  books  which would be more valuable were they reduced to one  To  have a Mind for Long for Wish for  To  Hanker after Lust after  The last of these expressions is more used in theology and supposes always an illicit object forbid by the laws of God thus we  lust after  a woman or the goods of another The others are all in common use and express our inclination to a thing be it what it will with the following difference between them We  have a mind for  or  long for  a present object but  have a mind  seems attended with more knowledge and reflection  long for  more opinion and more taste we  wish for  things farther  distant we  hanker after  things that more affect us  Princes sometimes  have a mind  to gratify their ambition at the expence of their future welfare Women with child frequently  long for  most things they see Lazy people often sit down and content themselves with  wishing for  those things they would presently obtain if diligent and assiduous Some children will  hanker  a long time  after  their nurses and it is with the greatest difficulty they can be brought to forget them    Gain Profit Lucre Emolument  Gain  seems to arise from something very casual and implies risk and hazard it is for this reason the word is in great use among gamesters and tradesmen  Profit  appears to be more sure proceeding either from lands or industry Thus we say the  profits  of the earth or the  profits  of our labour The characteristic of  lucre  consists in a simple relation to the passion of interest 'tis on this account  we say with the greatest propriety that man is fond of  lucre Emolument  relates to commissions and employments intimating not only the salaries but all other perquisites  Some persons are so particularly rigid as to condemn all  gain  arising from play Many will idly call that  profit  which has accrued by illicit means It is low and sordid to be ever led by  lucre  We do not always find the greatest honour in offices where there is the greatest  emolument    Very Extremely  We are apt to use these words indifferently one as well as the other to express a great degree of any thing Thus for example we say in the same sense  very  wise  extremely  wise notwithstanding this there appears to me some difference between them The word  very  marks an extraordinary degree but  extremely  a degree to admiration Thus we say men  are  very  wicked Providence is  extremely  kind  Besides this distinction there is one more delicate which is that  very  does not suit well but in the literal and natural sense for when we say a man is  very  wise we would be understod as saying truly wise whereas  extremely  may be used with elegance in an ironical sense We say then in raillery he is  extremely  wise in ceasing to pursue that he knows not how to get at and  extremely  patient in taking a blow calmly he has not the spirit to return    Fantastical Whimsical Maggotty Fanciful  Of these words that of  fantistical  implies a rambling from true taste thro excess of delicacy or an unseasonable search after something better That of  whimsical  means an affectation of singularity By  maggotty  is understood a great inconstancy or sudden change of taste  Fanciful  implies a certain revolution of humour or a particular way of thinking  There cannot be a more despicable creature than the  fantastical  fop he tricks out his charming self in hopes of attracting the respect of mankind but on the contrary meets only with scorn and contempt The  whimsical  man if his invention be fertile is sometimes an object of present admiration but on serious reflection is too frequently the subject of ridicule A  maggotty  person is equally tireforne to himself and to others as what pleases him one minute shall often displease him the next He who is  fanciful  is far more troublesome to himself than to others for being led away by his wild imagination he fondly believes many things to be real which in fact are only ideal    Capacity Ability  Capacity  has more relation to the knowledge of things  ability  to their application The one is acquired by study the other by practice  He who has  capacity  for a thing is proper  to undertake he who has  ability  to execute    Little Small  The word  little  sometimes signifies only want of bigness and at other times want of greatness in every sense whereas that of  small  is the opposite only to bigness and supposes some kind of length Thus we say a  little  house a  little  man a  little  cup a  little  globe but a  small  thread a  small  line a  small  twig  To  Remark Observe  To  remark  implies taking notice with attention in order to remember to  observe  means rather to watch with examination by way of passing our judgement  The traveller  remarks  that which strikes him most the spy  observes  those proceedings which he thinks of consequence  It is the part of a general to  remark  those of his men who distinguish themselves in battle and  observe  the motions of the enemy  We may  observe  in order to  remark  but custom will not admit of an inversion of the phrase  Those who  observe  the conduct of others in order to  remark  their faults do it rather through a delight in censuring than a desire of correcting their own errors  To  go Back Return  We  go back  from a place where we have some considerable time been We  return  to a place we had just before left Thus we say he is  gone back  into his own country He is  returned  home We say also he is  gone back  from virtue he has  returned  to his fault    Idea Thought Imagination Notion  The  idea  represents the object  thought  considers it  imagination  forms it thus worked up it becomes a  notion  The first only points the second examines the third seduces but the last draws  When in conversation our  ideas  are just our  thoughts  fine and our  imaginations  brilliant we shall be sure to please and our  notions  tho' singular will always be respectable    Business Affairs  Business  implies an object of industry  affairs  an object of concern The first employs the hands the second the mind The word  business  by its having no plural number intimates a particular employ by the singular of  affairs  being seldom in use in the sense before us that word is  understood to mean a variety of transactions  The man of much  business  ought to have a strong constitution He who has many  affairs  to settle tho' he may have a clear head will find it difficult to adjust them all to his satisfaction  He who continually interferes with the  business  of others neglecting his own  affairs  makes himself an object of ridicule and merits the contempt of mankind  To  Take Choose  When we would  take  a thing we determine upon one because we cannot have all We  choose  by comparing things because we would have the best The one supposes a simple determination of the will the other a discernment of the mind  Between two things exactly alike we may determine which to  take  when at the same time there is no  choice  We are sometimes constrained to  take  one thing out of many when we are not obliged to  choose  We cannot use the word  take  but with respect to ourselves but we  choose  sometimes for others  It is a point of goodmanners when offered fruit or any other thing where there is  choice  to  take  that which comes first to hand but when we would present any thing of the like sort to a stranger it is a mark of politeness to  choose  for him the best  When things are at our  option  that is when we may  take  which we please we should try to make a good  choice  Between a good course of life and a bad there is no medium we must either  take  the one or the other Nothing appears more difficult to me than the  choice  of a friend  If in a journey there were only two roads to  take  the one short but bad the other long but good I should certainly  choose  the last  To  Choose Make choice of  The word  choose  is most in its place with respect to things we would make use of The expression  make choice of  is more proper when it relates to persons we would appoint to any dignity or employ  George the third  chose  the Queen's palace as his place of residence in town and  made choice of  Caesar Hawkins to inoculate his children  To  choose  indicates more particularly a comparison made between things in order to know which is best to take to  make choice of  marks with greater precision the simple determination of one person preferable to another  Princes do not always  choose  their ministers neither do they always  make choice of  a Talbot for a chancellor nor a Marlborough for a general  To  Choose Prefer  We do not always  choose  what we  prefer  but we ever  prefer  that which we  choose  To  choose  is to determine in favour of a thing either on account of its merit or its value To  prefer  is to determine in its favour by any motive whatsoever whether it be merit affection goodmanners policy or what not  'Tis the judgment that makes the  choice  the heart that gives the  preference  'Tis for this reason that we commonly  choose  what we are acquainted with and  prefer  what we love  Prudence sometimes forbids our  choosing  that which strikes the eye most Justice will not often permit us to  prefer  our friends to other people  In  choosing  a state of life I think there can be no harm in  preferring  that which is most agreeable to our inclinations as in  so doing we should naturally find more satisfaction in our duty  Choice  is either good or bad according to our taste or the knowledge we have in things  Preference  is either just or unjust as reason dictates or passion inspires  Partial  preference  is sometimes allowed to princes in the distribution of their honours but they should always make  choice  of the ablest men in their appointments to public offices    Meat Flesh  By the word  Meat  is understood any kind of food but  flesh  signifies only the natural composition of an animal Thus we say that fish and vegetables are proper  meats  for Lent and that the  flesh  of a partridge is very white and tender  Grain is the  meat  of birds  flesh  the food of beasts    Reformation Reform  Reformation  signifies often the action of reforming  reform  seldom any other than the effect  A general  reformation  of manners among the people will ever be found a very difficult and laborious task When we have not been able to complete a thing to our satisfaction by any sort of amendment we have often brought it to bear by a thorough  reform    Smooth Level  That which is not rough is  smooth  That which is free from either hollows or risings is  level  The  smoothest  marble is the best A country where there is neither hills nor valleys is  level  To  Fade Wither  Of these two words  wither  rises upthat of  fade  A flower which is  faded  may recover but that whichis  withered  can not  Beauty like a flower  fades  through length of time and may  wither  suddenly by an accident    Prerogative Privilege  Prerogative  relates to honour and personal preference it rises principally from subordination or from the relation persons bear among themselves whereas  privilege  implies some advantage from interest or office proceeding from the grant of a prince or the laws of a society  Birth gives  prerogatives  Offices give  privileges    Knowing Discerning  The  knowing  man acts surely he seldom deceives himself yet knowledge of life only is his fort The  discerning  man is clearsighted and judicious sees thro' the artifices of mankind with half an eye and will not suffer himself to be deceived his great abilities consist in distinguishing  The study of man will make a person  knowing  but it requires great experience and a long attention both to men and books to render him  discerning  An artful ingenious rogue will sometimes take in the  knowing  by a novel deceit through the fallacy of which the  discerning  man shall readily penetrate    Order Regularity  Each of these words implies a prudent disposition of things but that of  order  relates more to the effect which results from such a disposition that of  regularity  more to the power and to the model that conducts that disposition  We observe  order  in conformance to  regularity  The first is the effect of the second    Traffic Trade Commerce  Traffic  relates more to the exchange of merchandise  trade  and  commerce  to that of buying and selling with this difference that  trade  seems to imply the manufacturing and vending of merchandise within ourselves  commerce  negociating with other countries  We  traffic  with nations that have not the use of money by bartering one kind of merchandise for another  Trade  is looked upon by the wisest of men to be the support of every state as the prosperity of a kingdom depends in a great measure upon its riches and riches is the immediate effect of  trade  The great and extensive  commerce  that England holds with other nations makes us the glory and admiration of the world    Exchange Truck Barter  The word  exchange  means simply in a general sense the act of exchanging one thing for another be it what it may the other two are in use to denominate the particular kinds or methods of  exchange  of which this is the difference that the word  truck  is used with most propriety when speaking of serviceable things such as are moveable as the  trucking  of horses trinkets utensils c Whereas  barter  is a more mercantile expression and intimates the  exchange  of different commodities by way of traffic Thus so little are the natives of Guinea acquainted with the value of gold that they hold commerce with other nations by  bartering  it away for glass and other trifling ornaments    Regard Esteem Veneration Respect  When we entertain a good opinion of a man we are said to  regard  him when that  regard  increases we call it  esteem  we testify that  esteem  by  veneration  and prove it by submission through  respect  We have a natural  regard  for a quiet neighbour we  esteem  him if he studies the good of the neighbourhood if we perceive in him any eminent qualities we hold him in  veneration  and in proportion to the rank he is in above us either by birth or fortune we treat him with less or greater  respect  Being born in the same country claims  regard  Civility creates  esteem  Age and  merit render  venerable  rank and dignity  respectable    Retinue Train  Retinue  implies a number of followers  train  the same with order Thus his coach was attended with so great a  retinue  that there was no seeing the carriage for dust It was customary in a Roman triumph to have always a number of captive slaves in the  train    Occasion Occurrence Conjuncture Case Circumstance  Occasion  is used for the arrival of something new whether it be that which presents itself or what we seek and in a sense as indeterminate with respect to time as the object  Occurrence  is only in use to express that which happens unexpectedly  and with relation to the time present We make use of the word  conjuncture  to mark a situation proceeding from a concurrence of events whether of business or interest  Case  is employed to signify the main point with a special reference to the sort and singularity of the thing in question  Circumstance  carries with it no other idea than that of something additional accompanying another which is principal  We know people on particular  occasions  We should demean ourselves according to the  occurrence  of the times It is commonly the  conjunctures  that determines us which side to take It has been pretended that there are  cases  in which reason would condemn even an attention to virtue Diversity of  circumstances  will make the same man think differently upon the same subject    Uncertainty Doubt Suspence  In that sense in which these words are accounted synonymous they all three imply indetermination but  uncertainty  rises when the event of things is unknown  Doubt  when the mind knows not how to choose By  suspence  is understood an indetermined state when the mind is held in expectation  We are in  uncertainty  with respect to the success of our proceedings in  doubt  what step to take in  suspence  when we are held from acting by a delay of certainty  Uncertainty  requires caution  doubt  consideration  suspence  patience  A wise man is seldom  uncertain  as to what shall happen he foresees future events and prepares himself for them When we are in  doubt  and at a loss to determine we should leave the matter to the decision of others Of all states of indetermination that of  suspence  is the most  vexatious and the only remedy is a quiet resignation    Right Justice  Right  is the object of  justice  and that which is due to every one  Justice  is the conformity of our actions with  right  it is to render and secure to every one that which is his due The first is dictated by nature or established by authority either divine or human and is according to circumstances sometimes liable to change The second is the rule we should always follow and is ever invariable  It is consistent with the laws of  justice  to use the same means in support and defence of our  rights  as are often employed to attack them    Dejected Melancholy Lowspirited Dull  Dejection  is commonly caused by great affliction and is too often a mark of despair  Melancholy  is generally the effect of constitution its cloudy ideas overpower and banish all that are chearful  Lowspiritedness  is involuntary and often proceeds from a weakness of nerves excess of joy fatigue bad digestion will occasion it  Dullness  on the contrary is voluntary it arises frequently from discontent disappointment and from any other circumstance that may displease the mind  The mind in  dejection  is unhappy not having sufficient strength and reason to get the better of it  Melancholy  will sometimes wear away by frequent diversion and dissipation A person subject to  lowspirits  should pursue a regular course of life and a uniform method of living  Dullness  is encreased by giving way to it it is in our power to banish it whenever we please and the damp it throws on every company  one would imagine should be our greatest inducement to do it  The reverse of  dejection  is joy the reverse of  melancholy  chearfulness gaiety is the opposite to  lowspiritedness  and sprightliness to  dullness    Piercing Penetrating  The word  piercing  implies great strength of light and a stroke of the eye that of  penetrating  great force of attention and reflexion  A  piercing  mind sees things even through the veils that cover them it is difficult to conceal truth from it it will not suffer itself to be deceived A mind that  penetrates  reaches to the bottom of things without stopping at the surface it is not easy to deceive it neither will it suffer itself to be amused  Besides the above distinction  piercing  seems to be executed by a sudden glance  penetrating  by making way gradually  To  Put Place  Put  seems to have a general sense  place  one more limited meaning to  put  orderly and in a proper place  We  put  columns to support an edifice we  place  them with symmetry    Discernment Judgment  Discernment  relates not only to a thing itself but also to its appearances and is a distinguishing knowledge that prevents the confounding of one thing with another  Judgment  relates to a thing considered in itself only in order to investigate the truth and is a knowledge that determines The first is limited to things present its office is to discern truth from falsehood perfections from defects motives from pretexts the second prys even into futurity discovers the relation and  consequence of things foreseeing their effects In short we may say of  discernmeut  that it is knowing that it renders our ideas just and of  judgment  that it is wise that it makes our conduct discreet  When choice or determination with respect to the goodness or beauty of objects is in question we should have recourse to those who have  discernment  When we would take any step of consequence we should take the advice of such persons as have  judgment  Arts and sciences require  discernment  which is more or less nice according to the delicacy of the understanding or the extent of knowledge Government and the policy of states demand  judgment  which is more or less sure according to the force of reason and the length of experience    Satisfied Contented  We are  satisfied  when we have obtained what we wished for We are  contented  when we wish not for any more  It happens often that when well  satisfied  we are not the more  content  Possession will always prove  satisfactory  but it is the true enjoyment only of what we possess that can make us  content    Tale Novel Romance Story  Each of these words implies a small history or an entertaining relation of adventures the three first are supposed to be fabulous and made public whereas the last may be either true or feigned and told either in print or by word of mouth but as they carry ideas peculiar to themselves it is my business to point them out by the word  tale  then is meant a  short but dressedup narrative of some single adventure that of  novel  signifies an amusing history made up of many adventures and carried on through one or more volumes By  romance  is understood a collection of wild adventures in love and war  Tales  ought to be well related  novels  well invented  romances  well carried on  stories  well told  Tales  if attended with good morals are not only amusing but instructive  Novels  are of no other use than to entertain they waste the time without making the least improvement  Romances  spoil the taste of young people who by an attention to them are apt to prefer the marvellous to the natural and simple truth A droll  story  told with humour is a great enlivener of company    Continuance Continuation  Continuance  relates to duration  continuation  to extent  We should study a conscientious discharge of our duty during our  continuance  in any office The several books contained in the volume of Paradise Lost are  continuations  of the same subject    Continual Continued  There may be an interruption in that which is  continual  but that which is  continued  will not admit of it So that the first of these words denotes properly the length of duration although there may be intervals and different renewals and the second marks simply the unity of that duration independent either of length or  shortness of the time it is for this reason we say a  continual  noise  continual  rains but a  continued  stream and in music a  continued  base  Continual  interruptions will make us weary of the best undertakings In countries situated near the poles there is for the space of five or six months together one  continued  darkness insomuch that the inhabitants during that time are obliged to leave the place  To  Bid Order  The first of these is extremely general the other more limited To  bid  intimates direction to perform whether the person directing has any authority for so doing or not To  order  implies the exercise of authority  Some people are so very officious that they are always ready to do what they are  bid  whether the thing be right or wrong  or the person  bidding  be impowered to  order  them or not    Yet In the mean while However Nevertheless  Yet  seems to have more force and energy it assures with firmness in spite of every opposition  In the mean while  is less absolute it affirms only against contrary appearances  However  distinguishes two things which seem opposite supporting one without hurting the other  Nevertheless  affirms a thing by exception giving us to understand that it does not occur but at the time we are speaking  Though the whole earth is in arms against truth  yet  it does not prevent its triumphing Some parents are very strict with respect to the morals of their children  in the mean while  will indulge themselves in every thing their own heart can wish Addison was a wretched speaker  however  he was an excellent author  Churchill every one knows was a bad liver  nevertheless  he was of some service to his country by ridiculing vice and lashing venality    Excellency Excellence  Notwithstanding these words are evidently the same  excellence  being no other than  excellencie  contracted or the redundant syllable general in old writing taken away yet custom seems to have applied  excellency  to express the title of a govenour or that of an ambassador from one prince to another whereas by  excellence  is understood the state of abounding in any good quality    Pride Arrogance Vanity Presumption Haughtiness  Pride  is unreasonable or inordinate selfesteem  Arrogance  implies taking much upon ourselves and is  pride  attended with insolence and contempt  Vanity  is accompanied with affectation and means  pride  exerted on slight grounds By  presumption  is understood a blind and adventurous confidence with respect to  haughtiness  it is a mixture of softness and insolence the immediate effect of  pride  The  haughtiness  of the  proud  man is insufferable  Pride  makes us value ourselves  arrogance  despise others Through  vanity  we covet the attention of our acquaintance  Presumption  flatters us with having a vain power  The  proud  consider themselves in their own mind full and selfswoln they are taken up with their own person The  arrogant  claim to themselves what they have not the least pretentions to are ready  to insult those who will not allow them what they claim and look down on the rest of the world with contempt The  vain  value themselves upon the opinion of others greedy of esteem they are eager to engross the attention of all mankind The  presumptious  carry their audacious hopes even to chimeras bold to undertake they fondly imagine they have power to do every thing  The greatest pain we can possibly give the  proud  man is by laying his defects before his eyes We cannot hurt the  arrogant  so much as by silent contempt We cannot mortify a  vain  man more than by paying no attention to those qualifications or qualities he prides himself in In order to confound the  presumptuous  we need only desire him to put his  vain  designs in execution    Cure Remedy  We perform a  cure  We procure a  remedy  The first relates more to the malady and to the action of him who heals it the second has more relation to health and the state of the malady we heal We say of a  cure  that it is fine when its success does honour to the person who formed it and we say of a  remedy  that it is certain or sure when its operations are efficacious that is when it produces those consequences we intended and we say of both that they are either easy or difficult  Cure  seems to have no other object than stubborn disorders and those which proceed from constitution whereas  remedy  has a view to slight complaints and such as are of short duration  The more inveterate the disorder the more difficult the  cure  in many cases regular living is the best  remedy  The word  cure  is often considered as the effect of  remedy  Some  remedies  will complete a  cure  much sooner than others  Incurable disorders are not only those where the  cure  is absolutely impossible bu such as for which no  remedy  can be found    Haughtiness Disdain  Both these words denote a disposition that prevents affability and keeps us at a distance from those whom we think beneath us either in birth fortune or abilities with this difference that  haughtiness  is founded upon the esteem a man has for himself and  disdain  upon the disesteem he has for others  Haughtiness  is seldom met with but in persons of weak understanding and those who have had a bad education There are a sort of vain people who look upon  disdain  as a personal accomplishment and who use it on all occasions as a test of the merit they pretend to    Sloth Laziness Sluggishness  Sloth  and  laziness  are voluntary with this difference that  sloth  implies utter inactivity an absolute aversion to work  laziness  an inclination but a fear of trouble and fatigue whereas  sluggishness  is often involuntary proceeding sometimes from constitution and is discovered by its dull heavy method of acting  The  slothful  man will not work at all The  lazy  man is drawn to it with difficulty The  sluggish  man is slow through the whole operation  Industry is the reverse of  sloth  activity of  laziness  expedition of  sluggishness  He who is  slothful  is a murderer of time  Laziness  is its own punishment A  sluggish  person is fit for no kind of employment seldom doing any thing well he undertakes    Harm Hurt Injury Detriment Mischief  These words imply some kind of ill happening to a man's person character or property Those of  harm  and  hurt  relate more to the person or character with this difference that  harm  seems to denote a small degree of  hurt hurt  a great degree of  harm Mischief  implies ill to the person or property and appears ever to be done with an evil intent  Injury  intimates a degree of  hurt  without justice and relates to the character or property  Detriment  carries an idea of loss and is seldom used but with regard to property  By wounding a man more or less we  harm  or  hurt  his person By speaking ill of him deservedly or not we  harm  or  hurt  his character by breaking his head or setting fire to his house we are said to do him a  mischief  By taking away his good name we  injure  his character by defrauding him of his goods we  injure  him  in his property By breaking a hedge or treading down of corn we do a great deal of  detriment    Quickly Soon Speedily  The word  quickly  seems more proper to express the motion with which we act its reverse is slowly The word  soon  respects the time when the action is performed its reverse is late The word  speedily  has a greater relation to the time we employ about a thing its reverse is longtime  We advance the more by going  quick  but we go surely by going slowly Wickedness is always punished either  sooner  or later It is necessary to be a longtime deliberating but we should execute  speedily  He who begins  soon  and works  quick  will  speedily  have done    Assiduous Expeditious Quick  When we are  assiduous  at work we lose no time when  expeditious  we defer not but finish immediately when  quick  we work with activity Idleness delay and slowness are the three defects opposite to these three good qualities  An  assiduous  man thinks nothing of the trouble of what he takes in hand An  expeditious  man will not quit his work One that is  quick  will presently have done  We should be  assiduous  in what we undertake  expeditious  in affairs that require to be soon ended and  quick  in the execution of orders    Now Instantly Immediately Presently  The doing a thing  now  expresses the taking it in hand at that very instant the other three words as they are here placed express a time farther and farther off  Instantly  implies without any perceptible intervention of time  Immediately  means without delay By  presently  is understood soon after    Fashion Custom  These two words like many others I have taken notice of tho' they may not strike the reader at first sight as words reputed synonymous have nevertheless been used as such by some of our best writers and are at present it is therefore necessary to point out the difference between them  Fashion  then seems  more universal  custom  more antient that which the greater part of the people practice is a  fashion  that which has been practised a long time is a  custom  Fasion  introduces itself and extends daily  custom  establishes itself and gains authority the first forms the mode the second a usage each is a kind of law independent on reason with respect to that which relates to our outward actions  There is sometimes more policy in conforming to a bad  fashion  than being singular in some good things Many persons follow  custom  even in their way of thinking imbibing the notions of their mothers and nurses    Variation Change  Variation  consists in being as much of one sort as another  Change  consists only in ceasing to be the same  We  vary  in our sentiments when we give them up and embrace them again We  change  our opinions when we reject one in order to embrace another  He who has no certain principles is liable to  vary  He who is more attached to fortune than truth will find no difficulty in  changing  his doctrine    Variation Variety  Successive changes in the same subject make  variation  A multitude of different objects forms  variety  Thus we say the the  variation  of time  variety  of colours  There is no government but is subject to  variation  There is no species in nature in which we may not observe great  variety    Track Footstep  Track  is more general meaning any mark left on the way of whatever passed  Footstep  is more limited implying the print of the feet Thus we say the  track  of a horse or a carriage but the  footsteps  of a man    Fickle Inconstancy Unsteady Changeable  The attachments of the  fickle  man are slight those of the  inconstant  of short duration As to the words  unsteady  and  changeable  they imply an aversion in adhering to the same thing with this difference that the  unsteady  man is eager to enjoy many things the  changeable  man is in constant search of different ones  Men are commonly more  sickle  and  inconstant  than women but women more  unsteady  and  changeable  than men The first err thro' indifference the second thro' a love of novelty Consequently it is a merit in men to persevere and in women to resist    Rogue Sharper Thief  These are all persons who steal what does not belong to them with this difference that the  rogue  steals in secret he pilfers The  sharper  steals by finesse he overreaches The  thief  steals by all manner of means robbing by force and violence  The  rogue  fears to be discovered the  sharper  to be known again and the  thief  to be taken    Intention Design  Intention  is a disposition or inclination of the mind to something at a distance its characteristic is to aim  Design  seems to suppose something studied and methodical  it is employed in searching out the means of execution  Intentions  are more secret and vague  designs  more extensive and more rational  Intention  is the soul of action and the spring of true worth  Design  is the effect of reflection  As no one cares to be balked in his  intentions  or crossed in his  designs  we should have no other  intention  than to do our duty nor any other  design  than to conform to the will of Providence  Nothing is less followed than the original  intention  of charitable foundations Nothing has been found more difficult to accomplish than the  design  of bringing about a thorough reformation of manners  That man is truly great who is right in his  intentions  and reasonable in his  designs    Unpolite Clownish  It is a much greater defect to be  clownnish  than to be barely  unpolite  Unpoliteness  is a want of goodmanners it does not please  Clownishness  is a mixture of illmanners it displeases  Clownishness  proceeds from an entire want of education  unpoliteness  is owing to a bad one  To  Tolerate Suffer Permit  We  tolerate  a thing when knowing it and having sufficient power we do not hinder it We  suffer  it by making no opposition but seeming either not to know it or not to have the power of preventing  it We  permit  it when we authorise it by formal consent  The words  tolerate  and  suffer  are never used but with respect to bad things or such as we believe so whereas the word  permit  relates either to good or bad  The legislative power is sometimes obliged to  tolerate  certain evils in order to prevent worse It is sometimes prudence to  suffer  even abuse in the discipline of the church rather than destroy its unity Human laws never will  permit  what the divine law forbids but sometimes forbids what the other will  permit    Gay Merry Diverting  We are  gay  by disposition  merry  through turn of mind  diverting  by our way of acting Sad serious and tiresome are exactly their opposites  Our  gaiety  turns almost entirely to our own advantage our  merriment  at the same time that it is agreeable to others it is no less so to ourselves but our being  diverting  is enjoyed only by the company  A  gay  man will laugh himself a  merry  man is good company a  diverting  man will make us laugh  We should if possible suppress our  gaiety  when in the house of affliction We should cease to be  merry  when others are sad We should take care not to be  diverting  at the expence of our character or goodsense    Enmity Rancour  Enmity  is more declared it seems always open  Rancour  is more concealed it generally dissembles  Bad services and rude language create  enmity  which never ceases 'till tired out  with punishing or a reconciliation is brought about by the intercession of friends Remembrance of injuries or affronts received keeps  rancour  alive in the breast which never subsides while there is the least thirst of vengeance or 'till we pardon sincerely  Enmity  does not always destroy our esteem for an enemy nor prevent our doing him the justice he is entitled to but it will not admit of our caressing him or doing him any good otherwise than through a sense of honour or greatness of soul to which we sometimes sacrifice our vengeance  Rancour  makes us embrace with pleasure every opportunity of revenging ourselves but can hide itself with the cloak of friendship 'till the very moment it begins to act  Enmity  is sometimes noble and it would be mean not to conceive it against certain persons but  rancour  is always low  A settled  enmity  in families sometimes runs through many generations and will not cease 'till time shall obliterate it Perfect reconciliations are very rare there remaining  often a great deal of  rancour  in the breasts of those who seem most sincere  A philosopher should have no object of  enmity  but the disturbers of public tranquillity If  rancour  can in any case be excusable it must be with respect to traitors their crime being too black to be thought of without indignation  To  Insinuate Suggest  We  insinuate  by cunning and address we  suggest  by credit and artifice  In order to  insinuate  we must consult both time and opportunity in order to  suggest  it is necessary to have ascendancy over the minds of persons  Insinuate  implies something delicate  suggest  frequently something fraudulent  We cover artfully what we would  insinuate  and what we would  suggest  we make of some consequence  We often imagine that what others  insinuate  was first thought of by ourselves He who  suggests  evil to another is much more culpable than he who commits it    Ordinary Common  These words have been reputed synonymous in two senses as implying frequent use and meaning of little or no value but they are different in both In the first sense the word  ordinary  seems to me to be best applied when the repetition of actions is in question  common  when a multitude of objects Thus nothing is more  ordinary  at court than dissimulation Monsters are  common  in Africa  In the second that which is  ordinary  has nothing to distinguish it that which is  common  has nothing to make it sought after  To  Hear Hearken  To  hear  implies having the ear struck with any sound To  hearken  means to lend an ear in order to  hear  Sometimes we  hear  without  hearkening  and we often  hearken  without  hearing  To  Understand Comprehend Conceive  To have just and proper ideas of every thing that occurs is the common signification of these words but to  understand  implies a conformity of ideas which has a peculiar relation to the value of the terms we use to  comprehend  denotes such a conformity as answers directly to the nature of the things we explain and that which is expressed by the word  conceive  relates more especially to the order and design of what we propose The first is used with propriety when applied to the particulars of what we say the tone with which we speak the turn of our phrases and the delicacy of our expressions The second seems to agree best with a relation to principles lessons precepts and speculative knowledge The third appears with greater elegance when it relates to forms arrangement projects and plans in short all that depends on the imagination  We  understand  languages We  comprehend  sciences We  conceive  whatever has relation to arts  It is difficult to  understand  that which is enigmatical to  comprehend  that which is abstruse and to  conceive  that which is confused  Readiness of  understanding  is a mark of acuteness that of  comprehension  is a proof of penetration that of  conception  denotes a clear head  A lover  understands  the language of the passions A learned man  comprehends  the metaphysical questions of the schools An  architect  conceives  the plan and oeconomy of buildings    Fashion Figure Form  Fashion  rises from labour and results from the workmanship the workman enriching it more or less according to his taste  Figure  springs from design and results from the outlines of the thing the author of the plan making it either more or less regular according to his abilities  Form  rises from construction and results from the arrangement of parts the conductor of the work making it more or less natural as his imagination directs him  The  fashion  of a work frequently exceeds in value the price of the materials We seldom give in architecture a round  figure  to any thing except to single pieces and such as stand by themselves Paganism pictures the Deity under all kinds  of  forms  whereas Christianity confines it to those of a man and of a dove  We say of  fashion  that it is either pretty or ugly of  figure  that it is either agreeable or disagreeable of  form  that it is either common or uncommon    Fault Defect Imperfection  Fault  includes in its idea a relation to the maker so that while it implies some real want in the finishing of the work it denotes also that it was owing to the workman  Defect  expresses something  imperfect  in the thing without any relation to the maker of it  Imperfection  intimates something of less consequence than is understood by the preceding words and is used with more propriety in morality than either in physics or mechanics  The smoaking of chimneys is a great  fault  in houses as a little attention in the builder may easily prevent it When the beauty of a building is spoiled for want of  room or proper materials it is a  defect  which the builder could not prevent  Imperfections  are considered by the bigotted religionist as real sins but reasonable christians look upon them only as the natural consequents of frail humanity    Fault Crime  Faults  result from human weakness being transgressions of the rules of duty  Crimes  proceed from the wickedness of the heart being actions against the rules of nature  The effects of anger and the intrigues of gallantry are  faults  Calumnies and assassinations are  crimes  It is our indispensable duty to pardon  faults  but punish  crimes  To  Oblige Constrain  To  Compel Force  The last of these words rises upon the third as the third does upon the second  and the second upon the first each of them implying an opposition to liberty The word  oblige  relates more to duty or necessity intimating a power acting on us in conformity to our inclinations  constrain  refers to those troublesome oppositions that make us determine against our inclinations  compel  alludes to power and authority which makes us act in express contrariety to our will which we lament the not being master of the word  force  implies contrary efforts of a vigorous action which we try to resist but in vain  The duty of a child to its parents  obliges  it to assist him in his oldage The weaker and softer sex is that which can least brook  constraint  There are some occasions on which we should not be sorry to be  compelled  even to that we are most unwilling to do Ancient politeness of the table went so far as to  force  guests to eat and drink    Heaviness Weight  In the figurative sense the difference of these words is so extremely great as to need no pointing out in the literal indeed they are often confounded considered then in this last sense  heaviness  is that quality in a body which we feel and distinguish by itself  weight  is the measure and degree of that quality which we cannot ascertain but by comparison  We say absolutely and in an undetermined sense that a thing is  heavy  but relatively and in a manner determined that it is of such a  weight  for example of two three or four pounds  A thousand circumstances prove the  heaviness  of the air and the mercury determines its exact  weight  To  Return Surrender Restore  We are said to  return  what has been lent or given us to  surrender  what we have in pledge or charge to  restore  what we have taken or stolen  We ought to  return  punctually to  surrender  faithfully and to  restore  wholly  We borrow with an intent to  return  we take a thing in charge with a view of  surrendering  it again but we seldom take with a design to  restore  Custom makes use of these words on the following occasions the first with respect to civility favours presents or testimonies of kindness the second with respect to what we are entrusted with honours employs or offices with which we are invested the third with relation to things taken away that have been our due Thus we  return  money that has been lent us presents we have received and letters to a deserted sweetheart we  surrender  a child to its parents the ribbon of an order the staff of command seals and dignities to a prince we  restore  an accused person when found innocent to his estates and honours and a minor to the possession of his effects which have been held from him    Sincerity Frankness Plainness Ingenuousness  Sincerity  prevents our speaking otherwise than we think and is a virtue  Frankness  makes us speak as we think and is a natural effect  Plainness  is speaking freely what we think and springs sometimes from want of reflection  Ingenuousness  makes us declare what we know and is often a folly  A  sincere  man will not deceive a  frank  man will not dissemble a  plain  man is not apt to flatter an  ingenuous  man knows not how to conceal any thing  Sincerity  is of great value in the intercourse of the heart  Frankness  facilitates  the commerce of the world  Plainness  is often considered as a want of politeness  Ingenuousness  is frequently found to err against prudence  The  sincere  are always esteemed The  frank  please all the world The  plain  sometimes offend The  ingenuous  often betray themselves    Experiment Trial Proof  Experiment  relates properly to the truth of things it determines whether a thing is or is not clearing up of doubt and dissipating ignorance  Trial  concerns particularly the use of things judging whether they are proper or not it settles the matter and determines the will  Proof  has a greater relation to the quality of things teaching us whether they are good or bad distinguishing the best and taking away any fear of being deceived  We make  experiments  in order to know  trials  to choose and  proofs  to be thoroughly acquainted with  Experiments  confirm our opinions being the root of knowledge  Trial  conducts our taste being the road to satisfaction  Proof  removes our fears and is a remedy against error and imposture  End of the FIRST VOLUME
