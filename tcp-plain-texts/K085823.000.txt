 AN ADDRESS TO YOUNG MINISTERS  BY JOHN BROWN LATE OF HADDINGTON  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CHAPMAN NO FLEET STREET  PRICE THREE PENCE  AN ADDRESS TO YOUNG MINISTERS  MY DEAR FRIENDS  WHEN I am gradually stepping into the eternal state to appear before the judgmentseat of Christ permit me to beseech you as you wish to promote his honour and the eternal salvation of your own and your hearers' souls  See that ye be REAL CHRISTIANS yourselves I now more and more see that nothing less than REAL REAL Christianity is fit to die with and make an appearance before God Are ye then indeed  born again born from above born of the Spirit created in Christ Jesus unto good works new creatures in Christ Jesus  having  all old things passed away and all things become new  Are ye indeed the circumcision which  worship God in the Spirit  habitually reading meditating praying preaching conversing with your hearts under the influence of the Holy Ghost Have you no  confidence in the flesh  no confidence in your selfrighteousness your learning your address your care and diligence your gifts and gracesbut being emptied of self in every form are  poor in spirit less than the least of all saints  and the least of all God's mercies nay the very  chief of sinners  in your own fight Hath it pleased God  to reveal his Son in  you and to instruct you with a strong hand to count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ as your Lord and to count them but dung that you may win him and be found in him not having your own righteousness but the righteousness which is of God by faithand to know the power of his resurrection and the  fellowship of his sufferingsand to press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus If you be or become  graceless  preachers or ministers of the gospel how terrible is your condition If you open your Bible the sentence of your redoubled damnation flasheth into your conscience from every page If you compose your sermon you but draw up a tremendous indictment against yourselves If you argue against or reprove other men's sins you but aggravate your own If you publish the holy law of God you but add to your rebellion against it and make it an awful witness against your treacherous dissimulation If you announce its threatenings and mention  hell  with all its insupportable torments you but infeoff yourselves in it and serve yourselves heirs to it as the inheritance appointed you by the Almighty If you speak of Christ and his excellencies fulness love and labours it is but to trample him under your feet If you take his covenant and gospel into your mouth it is but to profane them and cast them forth to be trodden under foot of men If you talk of spiritual experiences you do but despite to the Spirit of grace If you commend Father Son and Holy Ghost and invite sinners to newcovenant fellowship with them you but treacherously stab them under the fifth rib and betray them with a kiss and from your heart cry This is the heir the God come let us kill him While you hold up the glass of God's law or gospel to others you turn its back to yourselves The gospel which ye preach to others is hidis a savour of death unto death to you the vail remaining on your hearts and the God of this world having blinded your mindsWithout the saving the hearttransforming knowledge of Christ and him crucified all your knowledge is but an accursed  puffer up  and murderer of your own souls And unless the grace of God make  an uncommon stretch  to save you how desperate is your condition Perhaps no person under heaven bids more unlikely to be saved than a  graceless minister  his conscience is so overcharged with guilt so seared as with an hot iron and his heart so hardened by the abuse of the gospelAlas my dear pupils must all my instructions all the strivings of the Holy Ghost all your reading all your meditations all your sermons all your evangelical principles all your profession all your prayers as traps and snares take and bind any of you hand and foot that you may be cast as  unprofitable servants  into  utter darkness  with all the contents of your  Bible and other booksall your gifts and apparentlike graces as it were inlaid in your conscienes that as fewel or oil they may for ever feed or enrage the flames of God's wrath upon your souls After being set for a time at the gate of heaven to point others into itafter prophesying in Christ's name and wasting yourselves to shew others the way of salvation and to light up the friends of our Redeemer to their heavenly restmust your own lamp go out in everlasting darkness and ye be bidden  Depart from me I never knew you ye workers of iniquity  Must I must all the churches behold you at last brought forth and condemned as archtraitors to our Redeemer Must you for ever in the most tremendous manner sink into the bottomless pit under the weight of the blood of the great God our Saviourunder the weight of murdered truths murdered convictions murdered gifts murdered ministrations of the gospel and murdered souls of men  Ponder much as before God what proper FURNITURE you have for the ministerial work and labour to increase it To him that hath shall be given Hath Jesus bestowed on you the Holy Ghost What distinct knowledge have you of the mysteries of the kingdom What aptness have you to teach bringing out of the good treasure of your own heart  things new and old  What ability to make the deep mysteries of the gospel plain to persons of weak capacities and to represent things delightful or terrible in a proper and affecting manner What proper quickness in conceiving of divine things and what rooted inclination to study them as persons devoted to matters of infinite importance What peculiar fitness have you for the pulpit qualifying you in a plain serious orderly and earnest manner to screw the truths of God into the consciences of your hearers With what stock of selfexperienced truths and texts of inspiration did or do you enter on the ministerial work Of what truths relative to the law of Godor relative to sin Satan or the desertions and terrors of God hath your soul not only seen the evidence but felt the power What declarations promises offers and invitations of the glorious gospel have ye with joy and rejoicing of heart found and eaten and therein tasted and seen that God is good Of what inspired truths and texts can you say  Even so we have believed and therefore we speak  what we have seen and heard with the Father and tasted and handled of the word of life that we declare unto you  Thrice happy preacher whose deeply experienced heart is next to his Bible his principal notebook  Take heed that your CALL from Christ and his Spirit to your ministerial work be not only REAL but EVIDENT Without this you can neither be duly excited or encouraged to your work nor hope nor pray for divine success in it nor bear up aright under the difficulties you must encounter if you attempt to be faithful If you run unsent by Jesus Christ and his Spirit notwithstanding the utmost external regularity in your licence call and ordination you in the whole of your ministrations must act the part of a sacrilegious thief and robber a pretended and treacherous ambassador to Christ and his Father and a murderer of men's souls not profiting them at all What directionwhat supportwhat assistancewhat encouragementwhat reward can you then expect Ponder therefore as before God Have you taken this honour to yourselves or Were ye called of God as was Aaron Hath Jesus Christ sent you to preach the gospel and laid upon you a delightful and awful  necessity  to preach it While he powerfully determined you to follow providence and avoid every selfish and irregular step towards entrance into the office as a mean of  eating a piece of bread  or enjoying carnal ease and honour did he breathe on you and cause you to receive the Holy Ghostfilling you with deep compassion to the perishing souls of men and a deep sense of your own unfitness for such arduous work and fervent desire that if the Lord were willing to use you as instruments of winning souls he would sanctify you and make you meet for his workPerhaps providentially shut out from other callings to which you or your parents inclined did you in your education go up  bound in the Spirit  by the love of Christ burning in your hearts and constraining you cheerfully to surrender yourselves to poverty reproach and hatred of men for promoting his name and honour and the salvation of men in the worldWhat oracles of God powerfully impressed on your soul have directed and encouraged you to his workKnow you in what form Jesus Christ gave you your commission Whether to  open the eyes of the Gentiles and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto Godthat they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among them who are sanctified by faith  in himOr to  go make the heart of this people fat their ears heavy  and to  shut their eyes  See that your END in entering into or executing your  office be single and disinterested Dare you appeal to him whose eyes are  as a flame of fire  and who  searcheth the hearts and trieth the reins  to give to every man according to his works that you never inclined to be put into the priest's office that you might  eat a piece of bread and look every one for his gain from his quarter  that ye  seek not great things for yourselves  that ye  covet no man's silver gold  or  apparel  that ye seek not men's property but  themselves  that you may win them to Christ for their eternal welfare that ye seek not your own honour ease or temporal advantage but the things of Christ and his people that ye  seek not honour  or  glory of men  but the honour of Christ and his Father in the eternal salvation of souls and have determined to prosecute this end through whatever distress or danger the Lord may be pleased to lay in your way  See that your minds be deeply impressed with the NATURE EXTENT and IMPORTANCE of your ministerial workthat therein it is required of you as  ambassadors for Christ  as  stewards  of the mysteries and manifold grace of God  to be faithful  to serve the Lord with your spirit and with much humility in the gospel of his Son to testify repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ not keeping back or shunning to declare every part of the counsel of Godor any profitable instruction reproof or encouragement and not moved with any reproach persecution hunger or nakednessto be ready not only to be bound but to die for the name of the Lord Jesus in order to finish your course with joy Bearing with the infirmities of the weak and striving together in prayer that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified and your messages provided by God and made acceptable to your hearers you must labour with much fear and trembling determined to know to glory in and make known nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucifiedpreaching the gospel  not with enticing words of man's wisdom  as menpleasers but with great plainness of speech in demonstration of the Spirit and with power speaking the things which are freely given you by God not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but in  words which the Holy Ghost teacheth  comparing spiritual things with spiritualas having the mind of Christ always triumphing in HIMand making manifest the savour of the knowledge of him in every place that you may be a sweet savour of Christ in them who are saved and in them who  perishas of sincerity as of God in the sight of God speaking in Christ and through the mercy of God not fainting but renouncing the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully or corrupting the truth but manifesting the truth to every man's conscience as in the sight of God not preaching yourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and yourselves servants to the church for his sake always bearing about his dying that his life may be minifested in youand knowing the terror of the Lord and deeply impressed with the account which you and your hearers must give to him of your whole conduct in the day of judgmentawed by his infinite authority and constrained and enflamed by his love you must persuade men beseeching them to be reconciled unto God and making yourselves manifest to God and to their conscienceand as their edification requires changing your voice and turning yourselves every way and becoming all things to all men in order to gain them to Christjealous over them with a godly jealousy in order to espouse them to him as chaste virginstravailing in Birth till he be formed in their hearts You must take heed to your ministry which you have received in the Lord that you may fulfil itstir up the gifts which were given yougive yourselves wholly to reading exhortations and doctrineand take heed to yourselves and to the doctrine which you preach that you may save yourselves and them that hear youwatching for their souls as they who do and must give an account for them to Godrightly dividing the word of truth and giving every man his portion in due season faithfully warning every man with tears night and day teaching every man particularly  young ones  and labouring to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus and warring not after the flesh nor with carnal weapons but with such as are mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds and casting down imaginations and subduing every thought and affection to the obedience of Christ Having him for the end of your conversation and holding fast the form of sound words in faith in and love to himnot entangling yourselves with the affairs of this life nor ashamed of the Lord or of his cause or prisoners but ready to endure hardships as good soldiers of Jesus Christ ye must go forth without the camp bearing his reproach and exposed as spectacles of sufferings to angels and men must not faint under your tribulations but feed the flock of  God which he hath purchased with his own blood and over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers preaching the word in season and out of season reproving rebuking and exhorting with all longsuffering and doctrinetaking the oversight of your people not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre of worldly gain or larger stipends but of a ready mindneither as being lords over God's heritage but as examples to the flock exercising yourselves to have a conscience void of offence towards God and towards manhaving a good conscience willing in all things to live honestlyexercised to godlinesskindly affectioned disinterested holy just and unblameableprudent examples of the believers in conversation in charity in faith and purityfleeing youthful lusts and following after righteousness peace faith charitynot striving but being gentle unto all menin meekness instructing them who oppose themselves avoiding foolish and unlearned questionsand old wives fablesfleeing from perverse disputings and worldly mindedness as most dangerous snares and following after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fighting the good fight of faith and laying hold on eternal lifekeeping your trust of gospel truth and ministerial office and without partiality or precipitancy committing the same to faithful men who may be able to teach othersand in fine faithfully labouring in the Lord to try and confute and censure false teachers publicly rebuke or excommunicate open transgressors restore such as have been overtaken in a fault in the spirit of meekness and having compassion on them to pull them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh and never conniving at or partaking with any in their sins Who is sufficient for these things May your sufficincy be of God and as your days are so may your strength be  See that ye take heed to your spirits that ye deal not TREACHEROUSLY with the Lord In approaching to or executing the ministerial office keep your hearts with all diligence for out of it are the issues of eternal life or death to yourselves and others Building up yourselves on your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto the eternal life If you do not  ardently  love Christ how can you  faithfully  and  diligently  feed his lambshis sheep Alas how many precious  sermons exhortations and instructions are quite marred and poisoned by coming through the cold carnal and careless heart of the preacher and being attended with his imprudent untender and lukewarm life If you have not a deepfelt experience of the terrors of the Lordof the bitterness of sin vanity of this world and importance of eternityand of the conscience quieting and heartcaptivating virtue of Jesus' bleeding love how can you be duly serious and hearty in preaching the gospel If all influenced by a predominate love to Christ your heart be not fixed on everlasting things and powerfully animated to an eager following of peace and holiness how can you without the most abominable treachery declare to men their chief happiness and the true method of obtaining it If your graces be not kept lively your loins girt and your lamps burning all enkindled by the heartconstraining love of Christ how cold carnal and blasted must be your sacred ministrations If your work as ambassadors of Christ be to transact matters of everlasting importance between an infinite God and immortal but perishing souls of men if the honours and privileges of it be so invaluable what inexpressible need have you of habitual dependence on Christ by a lively faith What selfdenial what ardent love to Christ and his Father what disinterested regard to his honour what compassion to souls what prudence what faithfulness and diligence what humility and holy zeal what spirituality of mind and conversation what order what plainness what fervour what just temperature of mildness and severityis necessary in every part of itIf while you minister in holy things your lusts prevail and are indulged you have less of real or lively Chistianity than the most weak and uncircumspect saints under your charge if your evil heart of unblief fearfully carry you off from the living God and you can live unconcerned while the powerful and sanctifying presence of God is withheld from yourselves or your flockshow sad is your and their case If your indwelling pride be allowed to choose your company your dress your victualsnay your text your subject your order your languageif it be allowed to indite your thoughts and to the reproach and blasting of the gospel of Christ to deck your sermon with tawdry ornaments and fancies as if it were a stage play and to blunt and muffle up its sharp arrows with silken smoothness and swollen bombastif it be allowed to kindle your fervour  and form your looks your tone your actionor to render you enraptured or selfconceited because of subsequent applauseor sad and provoked because your labours are contemned how dreadful is your danger and that of your hearers How can ministerial labours originating in pride spurred on by the fame of learning diligence or holiness hurt the interests of Satan from whose influence they proceedIf pride be allowed to cause you to envy or wound the characters of such as differ from or outshine you or to make you reluctant to Christian reproof from your inferiors how fearful is your guilt and danger Pride indulged is no more consistent with a Christian character than drunkenness and whoredomIf you take up or cleave to any principle or practice in religion in the way of factious contention how abominable to God is the  sower of discord among brethren  If you undervalue the peace and prosperity of the church of Christ and are not afflicted with her in all her afflictons how cruel and unchristlike your conduct If in justly proving your opponent deceivers and blasphemers you by your angry manner plead the cause of the devil will God accept it as an offering at your hands If you are slothful in studying or declaring the truths of Christif to save labour or expence you are inactive or averse to help such as have no fixed ministrations or to contrive or prosecute projects for advancing the kingdom of Christ and promoting the salvation of men how great is your baseness and fearful your hazardThink as before God did Jesus Christ furnish you for and put you into the ministry that you might idle away or prostitute your devoted time tear his church conceal or mangle his truths betray his interests or starve and murder the souls of men Are not your people the  flock of God which he purchased with his own blood  Will you then dare to destroy his peculiar property and portion and attempt to frustrate the end of his death Did Jesus die for men's souls And will you grudge a small labour or expence to promote his honour in their eternal salvation If the Son of God was crucified for mencrucified for you will you refuse through his Spirit to crucify your selfishness your pride your sloth your worldly and covetous disposition in order to save yourselves and them that hear youWhile your own salvation and the salvation of mulitudes are so deeply connected with your faithfulness and diligence while the powers of hell and earth to set themselves in opposition  to your work that in your falls they may triumph over Christ your Master and his churchwhile so many eyes of God angels and men are upon you why do you ever think or speak of eternal things of heaven and hell of Jesus's person offices righteousness love and free salvation without the most serious and deep impression of their importance While perhaps you preach your last sermon and have before you and on every hand of you hundreds or scores of perishing souls suspended over hell by the frail thread of mortal life not knowing what a day or hour may bring forthsouls already in the hands of the devil and as it were just departing to be with him in the lake which burns with fire and brimstonesouls already slain by the gospel of our salvation blasted and cursed to them partly by your means why do not tears of deep concern mingle themselves with every point you study every sentence you publish in the name of ChristWhen multitudes of your hearers some of them never to hear you more and just leaping off into the depths of hell are in respect of their needs crying with an exceeding bitter cry  Minister help help we perishwe utterly perishpluck the brand out of the burning fiery furnace  why spend your devoted time in idle visits unedifying converse useless reading or unnecessary sleepWhat if while you are so employed some of your hearers drop into eternal flames and begin their everlasting cursing of you for not doing more to promote their salvation When Jesus ariseth to require their blood at your hand how accursed will appear that knowledge which was not improven for his honour who bestowed it that ease which issued in the damnation of multitudes that conformity to the world which permitted or that unedifying converse which encouraged your hearers to sleep into hell in their sinsthat pride or luxury which restrained your charity or disgracefully plunged you into debtSince my dear pupils all the truths of God all the ordinances and privileges of his churchthe eternal salvation of multitudes and the infinitely precious honour of Jesus Christ and his Father as connected with  the present and future ages  of time are intrusted to you how necessary that like Jesus your Master you should be faithful in all things to him who appointed youIf you do the work of our Lord deceitfullyin what tremendous manner shall your parents who devoted and educated you for ityour teachers who prepared you for it the seminaries of learning  in which you received your instructionthe years which you spent in your studiesall the gifts which were bestowed upon youall the thoughts words and works of God in the redemption of menall the oracles commands promises and threatenings of God which direct inculcate or inforce your dutyall the examples of Jesus Christ and all his apostles prophets and faithful ministers all the leaves of your Bible all the books of your closet all the engagements you have come underall the sermons which you preachall the instructions which you tender to othersall the discipline which you exerciseall the maintenance which you receiveall the honours which you enjoy or expectall the testimonies which you give against the negligence of your parents masters ministers or magistratesall the vows and resolutions which you have made to reformand all the prayers which you have presented to God for assistance or success rise up against you as witnesses in the day of the Lord  See that ye as workmen who need not be ashamed earnestly labour RIGHTLY TO DIVIDE the word of truth according to the capacities needs and particular occasions of your hearers giving every one of them their portion in due season Never make your own case your inclination or honour but the need of souls and the glory of Christ the regulator of your choice of subjects Labour chiefly on the principal points of religion To bring down the fundamental mysteries of the gospel to the capacities of your hearers and inculcate on their consciences the great points of union and fellowship with Christ regeneration justification and sanctification will require all your grace learning and labour Never aim at tickling the ears or pleasing the fancies of your hearers but at convincing their consciences enlightening their minds attracting their affections and renewing their wills that they may be persuaded and enabled to embrace and improve Jesus Christ as freely offered to them in the gospel for wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption Labour to preach the law as a broken covenantthe gospel of salvationand the law as a rule of lifenot only in their extensive matter but also in their proper order and connexion It is only when they are properly connected that the precious truths of God appear in their true lustre and glory It is at your infinite hazard and the infinite hazard of them that hear you if you even by negligence either blend or put asunder  that law and gospel which Jesus Christ hath so delightfully joined together No where is it more necessary to take heed than in preaching up the  duties of holiness  Let all be founded in union to and communion with Christ all enforced by the pattern love righteousness and benefits of Christ  You have stated yourselves public witnesses for Jesus Christ who profess to adhere to and propagate his  injured truths  and to commemorate with thankfulness the  remarkable mercies  which he hath bestowed on our church and nationand to testify against and mourn over our own and our father's  fearful backslidings  from that covenanted work of reformation once attained in our land See that ye be judicious upright constant and faithful in your profession I now approach death heartily satisfied with our excellent Westminster  Confession of Faith Catechisms  and  Form of churchgovernment  and cordially adhering to these  Covenants  by which our fathers solemnly bound themselves and their posterity to profess the doctrines and practise the duties therein contained I look upon the Secession as indeed the cause of God but sadly mismanaged and dishonoured by myself and others Alas for that pride passion selfishness and unconcern for the glory of Christ and spiritual edification of souls which hath so often prevailed Alas for our want of due meekness gentleness holy zeal selfdenial hearty grief for sin compassion to souls in immediate connexion with us or left in the established church which became distinguished witnesses for Christ Alas that we did not chiefly strive to  pray better preach better  and  live better  than our neighboursStudy to see every thing with your own eyes but never indulge an itch after novelties most of those which are now esteemed such are nothing but  old errors  which were long ago justly refuted varnished over with some new expressions Never by your peevishness contentions eagerness about worldly things or the like make others think lightly of the cause of God among your hands If I mistake not the churches are entering into a fearful cloud of apostacy and trouble But he that endureth to the end shall be saved Be ye faithful unto the death and Christ shall give you a crown of life But if any man draw back God's soul shall have no pleasure in him  Always improve and live on that blessed encouragement which is offered to you as Christians and ministers  in the gospel Let all your wants be on Christ  My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus  Cast all your cares on him for he careth for you Cast all your burdens on him and he will sustain you If your holy services through your mismanagement occasion your uncommon guilt his blood  cleanseth from all sin  You have an  Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous who is the propitiation for your sins  If you be often difficult how to act he hath said  The meek will he guide in judgment the meek will he teach his wayI will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine eye set upon thee I will lead the blind in a way which they know not  If you be discouraged because of your rough way and your want of strength he hath said  When the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst I the Lord will hear them I the God of Israel will not forsake them I will open rivers in high places Fear not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee Yea I will help thee I will uphold thee the right hand of my righteousness Fear not worm Jacob I will help thee saith the Lord thy Redeemer I will wake thee a new sharp threshing instrumentand thou shalt thresh the mountains My grace shall be sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness As thy days are so shall thy strength be  If your troubles be many he hath said  When thou passest through the waters I will be with theethe rivers shall not overflow thee When thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burnt nor shall the flame kindle upon thee  If your incomes be small and pinching  Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for our sakes he became poor that we through his poverty might be rich He shall see his seed the travail of his soul and be satisfied  and he hath promised  I will abundantly bless her provision and satisfy her poor with bread I will satiate the soul of her priests with fatness  A salary of remarkable fellowship with Christ and of success in winning souls is the most delightful and enrichingIf your labours appear to have little success be the more diligent and dependent on Christ Never  mourn as they that have no hope  Let not  the eunuch say I am a dry tree  Jesus hath said  I will pour water on him that is thirsty and floods on the dry ground I will pour my Spirit on thy seed and my blessing on thine offspring A seed shall  serve him The whole earth shall be filled with his glory The kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ  Believe it on the testimony of God himself believe it on the testimony of all his faithful servants and if mine were of any avail I should add it that there is no Master so kind as Christ no service so pleasant and profitable as that of Christ and no reward so full satisfying and permanent as that of Christ Let us therefore  begin all things from Christ carry on all things with and through Christ and let all things aim at and end in Christ  FINIS
