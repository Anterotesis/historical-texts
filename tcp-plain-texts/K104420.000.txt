surprise to me that none of our countrymen have hitherto attempted to write a Treatise expressly upon what farmers call  Stock  by which I mean those domestic animals with which our fields our yards and stables are or ought to be stored such as horses cattle sheep and swine the know∣ledge of which I apprehend is at this period of improvement as neces∣sary for the farmer as the well cul∣tivating of a field for wheat barley turnips or any other crop For ac∣cording  to the present improved sys∣tem of farming there is such a con∣nection between the cultivation of the ground and the breeding rearing and fattening of cattle sheep and other domestic animals that a man will make but an indifferent figure in rural affairs if he does not understand the latter as well as the formerOur shelves are loaded with volumes that have been written on the subject of rearing crops while but little has been said upon those very useful animals referred to above Conscious of my own inability to undertake so import∣ant tho' necessary a task I repeatedly solicited some of my acquaintance who I believed to be well able to per∣form it and in particular one whom it is not necessary here to name for whose abilities I have the highest re∣spect whose whole life has been em∣ployed in breeding and improving  stock and who has carried it to very great perfection from the experience and close application of his whole life spent in the pursuit of breeding use∣ful stock But being unable to prevail upon him to write on this subject I shall venture to offer my own thoughts in the best manner I am able from the hopes that this may induce some abler person to write upon this hither∣to almost unbeaten track for the good of mankind and particularly for the benefit of my brother breeders  IT may be necessary to observe that tho' a late writer  Clark's Theory of Husbandry  has given us very learned descriptions of the bull horse and ram c yet it does not appear he has treated of these matters near so fully as the nature and import∣ance of the subject requires His lan∣guage is not altogether so plain nor  adapted to the education of many of our farmers as it ought to be He is far too concise in regard to the differ∣ent breeds of sheep belonging to this island and has said nothing at all re∣lative to the various breeds of cattle and besides tho' his descriptions have much merit yet I shall venture to dif∣fer from him in some particulars con∣cerning the shape of cattle and sheep which will be pointed out in their proper placesAs I do not profess any great share of knowledge in re∣gard to horses I shall consequently say less concerning them than the other kinds of stock with which I have been more conversant and to which I have paid more attention particularly sheep However as horses are universally allowed to be amongst the most useful animals of the crea∣tion we shall give them the first place in our narration  IN regard to the horse then I pre∣sume his head should be as small as the proportion of the animal will ad∣mit his nostrils expanded and muzzle fine his eyes chearful and prominent his ears small upright and placed near together his neck rising out of his back and shoulders with an easy tapering curve must join gracefully to the head his shoulders being well thrown back must also go into his neck at what is called the points unperceived which perhaps facilitates the going much more than the narrow shoulder which most people are ad∣mirers of for whoever has observed a greyhound or a hare will perceive how very wide they are made at the upper part of the shoulders and there are few animals that move with so much ease and swiftness as they do The arm or fore thigh should be mus∣cular and tapering from the shoulder  meet with a fine straight sinewy boney leg the hoof circular and wide at the heel his chest deep and full at the girth his loin or fillets broad and straight and ribs round his hips or hooks by no means wide but quar∣ters long and tail set high on his thighs strong and muscular his legs clean and fineboned the legbones not round but what is called lathy  It is generally thought that we on∣ly have two original breeds of horses in this island  viz  the race or blood kind and the black cartbreed the rest have been supposed to be only varia∣tions from these two introduced by re∣peated crossings and yet we are struck with surprise when we consider the difference between the gigantic drayhorse hands high stalking upon the London pavements and the small Highland or Shetland poney tripping over the mosses with a heavy load  tho' not more than nine hands or inches high when at his full growth I shall decline saying anything of the bloodhorses st because I know very little concerning them and dly be∣cause I think farmers ought to have little or nothing to do with them ex∣cept now and then putting a good mare to a strong wellproportioned bloodhorse by way of mixing a little blood amongst our chapmen or riding horses Perhaps for some particular uses even a ploughhorse may not be the worse for having a little blood in him as it is termed and every man I apprehend who has rode five hun∣dred miles upon horseback will admit that a horse which has a little blood in him will usually perform a pleasanter day's work than one that has little or none of the racing breed in him For notwithstanding objections have been made by late writers to the crossing of  breeds of animals I cannot help being of a different opinion because from many years experience I have much reason to believe that great improve∣ments have been and may be made by crossing  What I mean by crossing is to put the best male of the same species or of different varieties of the same kind to the best females so as by repeated crosses in this way you have improved your breed as far as you can This I think is clearly right as long as better males can be met with among your neighboursamongst the improved breeds in any part of this island or why not from those in any part of the world provided the expence does not exceed the proposed advantage for I have no no∣tion of setting bounds to improvements of any de∣scription It quickens that laudible desire of ex∣celling our rivals which leads us to discoveries of the highest importancediscoveries which in every period have so eminently marked the genius and enterprising spirit of this blessed island Then when you can no longer at home or abroad meet with better males than your own breed from these whether horses neat cattle sheep c for the same rule that holds good in one kind will in another But upon no account attempt to breed or cross from worse than your own for that would be act∣ing in contradiction to common sense experience and that wellestablished rule viz  that best only can beget best  Allow me to add that from the best males and females only the best breeds can be obtained  not only amongst the diffe∣rent kinds of horses but neat cattle horned or black cattle as they have been differently called and sheep and I apprehend it is from these crosses  properly made that this island has been long famous for such a noted and excellent breed of saddlehorses in so much that great numbers are al∣most every year bought up for France and other parts of the Continent If crossing was not of use even amongst the bloodrace why should Gentle∣men of the Turf be at the trouble and very great expence in procuring stallions from Arabia and different parts of Turkey c Nay the wellattested pedigrees of most of our race∣horses  I perceive generally terminate with a Burton Barb or Place's White Turk c which is a proof that these crosses have been attended with suc∣cess  The breed of saddlehorses is con∣fined in a great measure to Yorkshire Durham and Northumberland the East Riding of Yorkshire has been long eminent in that line The annual fairs held at Northallerton Howden and York exhibit the largest shows of these useful creatures perhaps it may be owing to this that Yorkshiremen are all called Jockeys or knowing hands in regard to horses and indeed you will scarce meet with a farmer in that county especially in the low part of it who is not well skilled in horses Since bay and other light∣going horses have been preferred to the black breed for carriages the Yorkshire breeders have gone so much  upon these that I am informed the old breed of riding or saddlehorses are much wore out This is owing perhaps not only to the greater de∣mand for the latter but also to the coachhorses being a stronger and larger breed as also if they happen from blemishes not to answer for the harness they suit for the plough or cart while the saddlehorse from the same misfortunes is rendered in a great measure useless  The midland counties particular∣ly Leicestershire Warwickshire Staf∣fordshire and Derbyshire breed al∣most altogether of the black kind It is the universal custom in those coun∣ties for the farmers to use mares only for labour these are all put to the horse the male produce of which supply the Army London and most of the south and western counties with horses for their farmingteams  The largest go to the capital for dray∣horses the next supply the farmers in the southern counties for their wag∣gons ploughs c and the rest mount our cavalry or are trained to the car∣riages while a few of the choicest are very properly preserved for stallions  The vanity of many of the farm∣ers in the South in regard to their teams is most extraordinary I have in Berkshire and that neighbourhood several times met a narrowwheel'd waggon with six stonehorses one be∣fore another the first horse besides having on a huge bridle covered with fringe and tassels enough to halfload a common Yorkshire carthorse has six bells hung to it the next five and so on to the last which has only one and it is really divert∣ing to see with what a conceited air the driver struts and brandishes his long whipA strange contrast this  with the poor Highlander carting home his peats for winterfuel when frequently both horse and cart are not of the same value as the harness used to a Berkshire waggonhorse The Reader will be the less surprised when I assure him that I have in Scot∣land many times seen a horse and cart conveying peats or turfs when the whole apparatus neither contained iron leather or hemp the collar or bracham was made of straw the back∣band of platted rushes and the wheels of wood only without bush of metal or binding of iron  One of the Earls of Huntington re∣turning from an embassy to the StatesGeneral brought home with him a set of coachhorses of the black breed from the Continent Most of these being stallions he with some diffi∣culty prevailed upon his tenants by the TrentSide to put their mares to  them which cross answered so well that the breed in that neighbourhood has been in the greatest repute ever since This many years afterwards in∣duced Mr Bakewell and another Lei∣cestershire breeder to cross the Ger∣man Ocean in search of horses and mares to improve the English breed and after much labour and expence they returned with halfadozen Dutch or Flanders mares And I have often heard Mr Bakewell say that he never met with a man but he could have prevailed upon him to part with his stock for money except in Holland where he met with a Dutch boor who would not sell one of his mares for any price which Mr Bakewell thought worth his while to give and anybody who knows the above great breeder will be sensible that he would not limit for price who gave above seventy guineas when begin∣ning  business for a cartmare to breed from Notwithstanding these Dutch mares were of use in improving the Leicestershire black breed yet it per∣haps scarce answered the end proposed because by this time the heavy un∣wieldy black horses were growing in∣to disrepute the Nobility and Gentry were begun to run bayhorses in their carriages light horses were more used in the Army than heretofore but above all the spirited industry and activity in farming required horses of more mettle than those already mentioned but they yet are and probably will ever be valuable for drays and waggonsBut how would the Norfolk farmers sow two three or four hundred acres of turnips upon one farm in proper time in the same season and plow two or near three acres  per  day with one pair of horses if they had them not from a hardier  and nimbler breed than those allud∣ed to It is long since I was told by the Cleveland farmers that the black horses could not stand to their work and could not go at the rate of their own country horses that whenever they were put past their pace they greased and frequently went blind Yet it is in this industrious part of Yorkshire and in Norfolk Suffolk c that we must look for farminghorses able to go through fatigue and hardship able to walk at a pace that the others cannot and able to work six days in every week in the year It is a wellknown fact that these will upon an average wear as long again as the roughlegged gummy black breed  But let us not forget to do justice to a Northern district in this island that produces as good a farminghorse as any of these alluded toI mean  the West of Scotland They are in general greys or browns but from whence they had the breed I know not and tho' I must allow that they are plainmade in general about the head sides and hindlegs yet it is a fact founded upon experience that we have not a hardier race in the island  The best and hardiest horses for the draught I ever remember seeing pro∣ceeded from a cross between the coun∣try mares by the Tee's side and a stal∣lion brought from Holstein they are not tall horses rising only from about fourteen hands three inches to fif∣teen hands three inches exceedingly strong made with short cleanboned legs very firm carcases and equal to any fatigue  The Welch have a very hardy breed of horses but rather small for the team but where they are good goers few or none can equal them for the  road none stand our turnpikes like them and I well remember one that I rode for many years and to the last he would have gone upon a pavement by choice in preference to softer road  The Scotch horses like the Welch are exceedingly hardy but too small for the draught except the Clydesdale horses c taken notice of before Those properly called galloways are now rare to be met with from an inexcusable inattention to the breed which is nearly lost The breed ori∣ginated as we may suppose from the name Galloway and it is generally said was owing to crossing with the Spanish horses when a part of the invincible armada was shipwrecked upon those rocky coasts There is much probability in the account but whether true or not is not so material as the loss of so valuable a breed of little horses is to be lamented  NEAT CATTLE  Description of the Bull  THE head of the BULL should be rather long his muzzle fine and no∣strils wide his eyes lively and pro∣minent his ears long and thin his horns white his neck strong and ris∣ing rather from the shoulders but small and fine where it joins the head his shoulders broad at the top yet to sit full to his crops and chest backwards and to his neck veinputt or mousepiece forwards his bosom open breast deep broad and well seen before his legs his arms or fore∣thighs full and tapering to his knee his legs straight clean and very fine boned with good large hoofs his crops and chest so full as to leave no hollow behind the shoulders and so strong in the plates as to keep his  belly from sinking below the level of his breast his back or loin broad straight and flat ribs well up as the graziers term it viz one rising above another in such a manner as the last rib should be rather the highest which should leave only a small space to the hips or hooks these should be wide placed round and full in shape the quarters long tail high rumps close and the quarters instead of be∣ing square as recommended by some writers on husbandry should taper gradually from the hips backward the turls or pottbones quite sunk and in every respect different from the round lyery or Dutch form so unde∣servedly esteemed formerly The form here described will when fed be co∣vered with fat to the hock or hough the bones of his hindlegs same as those before  viz  clean small and straight tail broad and wellhaired  THOUGH I said that probably we only had two original breeds of horses in this island yet I apprehend we have several different breeds of cattle  viz  the longhorned or Lancashire kind the shorthorned or Dutch kind the polled humbled or Gal∣loway breed the Kiloes or Scotch cattle the Alderney or French breed and the wild breed which are still preserved by some of our Nobility in their parks and perhaps some others I may not be acquainted with  The Welch breed of cattle I take to be much the same as the Scotch and as to the Herefordshire brown cattle they are I am pretty clear neither more nor less than a mixture between the Welch and a bastard race of longhorns that are everywhere to be met with in Cheshire Shropshire c  I am told that besides the species I have trent∣ed of there are two more very useful breeds in this island  viz  One in Sussex valuable both for the draught and feeding quality the other in De∣vonshire also very good feedersBut as these are two of the few countries which I have not yet had it in my power to visit I think it would be wrong in me to say anything respecting their breeds of cattle  We shall treat of all the different breeds separately then endeavour to point out the perfections and imper∣fections of each kind compare them with each other and then offer our opinion in regard to which are best and most suitable to different situa∣tions  FIRST then in regard to the Longhorned or Lancashire kindThis kind is distinguished from the others by the length of their horns thick∣ness of their hides long thick hair all over them and having mostly a white streak along their back and a white streak on the middle of the hock or  hough The oxen are called in many places Lancashire Hornpipes I sup∣pose from the remarkable length of their horns  The Reverend Mr Norton an ingenious and intelligible gentleman whom I met with lately at Hinkley in Leicestershire tells me the neat cattle in the Azores are longhorned and in every re∣spect the same as our Lancashire breed only less in size and will have it that ours may have come originally from these islandsBut on considering this matter over with submission to Mr Norton I cannot help thinking that the neat cattle in the Azores are as likely to be descended from our longhorns as ours from these and perhaps might be taken to these islands from Britain by some en∣terprising navigator for the same reason and from the same laudible motive that our most excellent circumnavigator Capt Cook took many domestic animals to the islands in the Southsea which he had the honour to discover  Many people will have it that they are the native or origi∣nal breed of the island It is not easy to ascertain this matter but if I may venture a conjecture I think it is highly probable that these have been  the inhabitants of the open plain country while the wild breed or perhaps the Welch which I take to be nearly the same as the Scotch possessed the mountainous hilly wild parts of this island However Lanca∣shire at present and for a long time past has as much right to be called the mothercountry for longhorned cattle as Lincolnshire has to the large longwool'd sheep for though all or most of our cheesedairies in Cheshire Gloucestershire c employ a kind of longhorned cows and indeed the greatest part of the midland counties yet they are only a shabby mixed breed much inferior in size and fi∣gure to the Lancashire breed from whence it is very probable they all originated Leicestershire Warwick∣shire c have got a better and more profitable sort of longhorns than Lan∣cashire at present by buying up their  best bulls and heifers for many years past before the people of Lancashire were well aware of it Indeed the sormer paid more attention to that kind which were of a true mould or form consequently quicker feeders while the latter contented themselves with the oldfashioned large bigboned kind which are not only slower seeders but when fed are not such good eating beef In short the little farmers in Lancashire tempted with the high prices given them for their best stock had lost their valuable breed before they were quite sensible of it  As I may often have occasion in this Treatise to mention Mr Bake∣well from the superior manner in which he has distinguished himself in the breeding of cattle and sheep I would beg leave by a short digression to point out some of the principal  advantages this Gentleman's breed of ftock has over those that were in great∣est repute before his day For he absolutely struck out new lights and not only adopted a breed of cattle and sheep different from and supe∣rior in many essential respects to most others but established them in such a manner as to gain ground in every corner of Great Britain and Ireland in consequence of their superior merit  The kind of cattle that were most esteemed before Mr Bakewell's day were the large longbodied bigboned coarse gummy flatsided kind and often lyery or blackfleshed On the contrary this discerning breeder in∣troduced a small cleanboned round shortcarcased kindlylooking cattle and inclined to be fat and it is a fact that these will both eat less food in proportion and make themselves sooner fat than the others they will  in truth pay more for their meat in a given time than any other sort we know of in the grazing way His sheep are still more excellent than his cattle but as we shall have occasion to speak of these afterwards I will on∣ly add that perhaps this Gentleman was the principal cause of the Lanca∣shire people losing their best breed but then he also was the means of establishing a much more advanta∣geous one in Leicestershire  There are several more eminent breeders in that spirited part of the island where they have carried the breeding of useful stock to a pitch unknown in former days and what other parts of the island have still only a very faint idea of Mr Bake∣well well deserves the thanks of his country for promoting the breeds of useful domestic animalsThis Gen∣tleman by his laudible example has  not only improved the breeding of good stock near home but has spread it everywhere within those islands The Irish breeders have given him very large prices for his bulls Mr Bakewell keeps great numbers and has let several for one season as high as from twenty to sixty guineas each into different parts of Britain  THE shorthorned breed of cattle is the next to be described and it is pretty evident that our forefathers have imported these from the Conti∣nentFirst because they are still in many places called the Dutch breeddly because we find these cattle nowhere in this island except along the east coast facing those parts of the Continent where the same kind of cattle are still bred and reaching from Lincolnshire southwards to the borders of Scotland northwards The  longhorns and these have met upon the mountains which divide York∣shire from Lancashire c and by crossing they have produced a mixed breed called halflonghorns a very heavy strong and not very unuseful kind of cattle but we do not find that the one kind have spread further west nor the others eastBut dly I re∣member a Gentleman of the county of Durham a Mr Michael Dobison who went in the early part of his life into Holland in order to buy bulls and those he brought over I have been told did much service in im∣proving the breed and this Mr Dobi∣son and neighbours even in my day were noted for having the best breeds of shorthorned cattle and sold their bulls and heifers for very great prices But afterwards some other people of less knowledge going over brought home some bulls that in all probabi∣lity  introduced into that coast the dis∣agreeable kind of cattle well known to the breeders upon the river Tees and called lyery or doubledlyered that is blackfleshed for one of these creatures notwithstanding it will feed to a vast weight and though you feed it ever so long yet will not have one pound of fat about it neither within nor without  I once saw one of this sort killed which after feeding all summer had not a pound of fat inside nor out but I confess it was one of the compleatest of the kind I ever saw Its two ends  viz  shoulders and buttocks were heavy round and coarse with∣out any hipbones at all standing up and the body quite small in short it was more like an illmade black horse than an ox or cow  and the flesh for it does not deserve to be called beef is as black and coarsegrained as we generally suppose horseflesh to be However by the pains and attention of the breeders this useless disagreeable breed is now pretty well out of the  country No man will buy one of this kind if he knows anything of the matter and if he should be once taken in he will remember it well for the future for people conversant with cattle very readily find them out from their round form all over particularly their buttocks which are turned like a black coachhorse and the smallness of the tail But they are best known to the graziers and deal∣ers in cattle by the feel or touch of the fingers and indeed it is this nice touch or feel of the hand that in a great measure constitutes the judge of cattleBut more of this afterwards  The Yorkshire firkinbutter so fa∣mous in the London markets and thin skimmedmilk cheese are all made from the cows of this breed for they give the most milk of any kind of cows we know of tho' it is generally said not to be so good in  quality as the longhorned cows milk and tho' the cheeses made from longhorned cows fetch the highest price at market yet the firkinbutter made from the shorthorns has the best cha∣racter  Our heaviest and largest oxen when properly fed victual the EastIndia ships as they produce the thickest beef consequently keeps in the juices and suits best for such long voyages Our Royal Navy should also be vic∣tualled from these but by the jobs made by contractors and the abuses lately crept in our honest tars I am afraid are often fed with flesh rather than that valuable beef However the coalships from Newcastle Shields Sunderland c are totally supplied from the beef of these valuable ani∣mals These oxen in common feed to from to stone weight lb to the stone and they have several  times been fed to and some particular ones to stone the four quarters onlySir Thomas Hagger∣stone of Haggerstone in Northumber∣land perhaps bred and fed the two largest and heaviest oxen of this or any other breed then shewn in this kingdom The best judges allowed them to weigh stone eachhow∣ever their real weight was not known as Sir Thomas or his steward I am told sold them to two butchers who attempted to drive them to Edinburgh to shew them alive for money by the head but I understand the one drop∣ped down dead on the road and the other in Edinburgh or between that place and Glasgow from their exces∣sive fat and inability to travelor rather from the want of judgment or neglect in the drivers Since Sir Tho∣mas Haggerstone's oxen were killed Mr Hill of Blackwell near Darlington  in the county of Durham in the year had an ox killed of his own breeding and feeding whose four quarters weighed stone and lb lb to the stone and which I be∣lieve exceeded any ox ever fed in this island for either fat weight or beauty  This breed of cattle like most others is better and worse in different di∣stricts not so much owing I appre∣hend to the goodness or badness of the ground as to the judgment and attention of the breeders In Lin∣colnshire  In a journey through Lincolnshire last Au∣tumn I was happy to find that many of those sensible breeders had improved their breed of shorthorned cattle very much since my visiting that fine county ten years before from good bulls and heifers brought from the county of Durham and Yorkshire on both sides of the river Tees where the best are confessedly bred especially Mr Fisher of Kirkby near Sleaford who has remark∣able fine cattle indeed shewed me on ox entirely white which I thought the handsomest and heaviest I ever had seen Mr Hill's excepted    which is the farthest south that we meet with any quantity of this kind of cattle they are in general more subject to lyer or black flesh than those bred farther north And in that rich flat part of Yorkshire called Holderness they are much the same as south of the Humber of which we have been speaking It is probable they had stuck more to the lyery blackbeefed Dutch breed than their more northern neighbours at that unfortunate period when these were imported from the Continent or perhaps the latter had seen their error sooner But from whatever cause this happened it is a fact that as soon as we cross the Yorkshire Wolds northward we find this breed alter for the betterthey become finer in the bone in the carcase and in a great measure free from that disagree∣able lyery sort which has brought  such an odium upon this perhaps most valuable breed When you reach that fine country on both sides of the river Tees you are then in the center of this breed of cattlea country that has been long eminent for good stock of all kindsthe country where the Dobbisons first raised a spirit of emu∣lation amongst the breeders which is still kept up by Mr Hill Mr Charges Mr Collings Mr Maynard c The Darlington and Yarm annual fairs still continue to send out large droves of fine oxen steers and queys  I am sorry to observe that there are much fewer steers kept now than used to be formerly Two reasons may be assigned for this  First  Lands are now rented at so high a pitch that farmers cannot afford to keep steers to the age of oxen without working themwhich brings me to my  second  reason  viz  That fewer oxen are used in the draught now than formerly  And a remedy for this complain per∣haps may not be so readily pointed out because tho' a few people are convinced of the utility of drawing oxen in many cases yet the generality of farmers will be very unwilling to be persuaded to this because oxen are slower in their motion than hor∣ses without adverting to the advan∣tages attending the oxen in the feed∣ing shoeing harness c but above all the conclusion between an ox fatted for the shambles after working three or four years or indeed a lean ox sold to feed and a horse sold to the dogkennel is so exceedingly striking that I presume most people when they reflect upon this very important matter will agree to the drawing of oxen in every kind of work wherein they suit I use the expression  suit  because I would not be understood to think as some people do that oxen  will answer as well as horses in every kind of farming work by no means But I apprehend that oxen will do several kinds of homework equally as well as horses I advance this opi∣nion from several years experience and I do believe that most farmers might use part oxen along with their horses but permit me to say that I would in general recommend the oxen to draw by themselves and the horses by themselves because the dif∣ference of the step does not suit at all  Much more might be said upon this important subject but I must not now enter upon it and will only add that I heartily wish our Legislature would take this matter into considera∣tion and give premiums to encourage the rearing and drawing of oxen and also to promote the breeding of the best kinds of stock as there is little doubt but it would have most bene∣ficial  effectsIt is true that many of our agricultural societies do give pre∣miums for the above purposes but these though highly meritorious are only partial and confined to certain districts while the influence of the other would be general and extensive  The north part of Durham all Northumberland and a few places in the south of Scotland are almost the only places in this island where any number of oxen are now kept to age Part of these are bought by the drov∣ers to go south for grazing the rest are fed at home to supply the coaltrade It is true they draw a few oxen in Herefordshire and some of the western counties  In Sussex I believe and perhaps in Devon∣shire they draw oxen but as I said before I am unacquainted with these two counties  but those of Lancashire Yorkshire c are now mostly sold at three four or at most five years old steers and oxen  THE  Polled  or  Humbled Cattle  come next under our considerationa kind well deserving of notice We find a few of these straggling through differ∣ent parts of England and Scotland amongst the rest I remember Lord Darlington not many years ago had a very handsome breed of them finely globed with red and white But we must look for the original of these in Galloway a large district in the southwest of Scotland They are mostly bred upon the muirs or hilly country and grazed upon the lands nearer the sea until part of them are rising four and others five years old when the graziers and drovers take them up in prodigious numbers to the fairs in Norfolk and Suffolk  The principal fairs are Woolpit in Suffolk Hemptongreen Harleston and Saintfaiths in Norfolk    previous to the turnip feeding seasons from whence they are again removed in the winter and spring in part to supply the amazing consumption of the capital where they are readily sold and at high prices for few or no cattle sell so high in Smithfieldmarket being such nice cutters up and laying the fat on upon the most valuable parts and this is a great ex∣cellence in all feeding cattle It is no uncommon thing in this refined mar∣ket to see one of these little bullocks outsell a coarse Lincolnshire ox tho' the latter be heavier by several stones weight  I was told by a Lincolnshire grazier that a Lincolnshire bullock and a Scotch bullock sent from the same village to Smithfield at the same time were sold for exactly the same money tho' the Scot was only half the other's weight    The manner of rearing calves in Galloway is so singular and so dif∣ferent from anything of the kind  that I had before seen or heard of that I hope the mentioning of it here will not be objected toThey are al∣lowed to run with their dams all the day but are prevented from suck∣ing by means of a small piece of leather with sharp spikes of iron fixed upon the outside tied upon the upper part of the calf's nose which prickl∣ing the cow every time the calf at∣tempts to suck prevents her from letting it suck until the milkmaid comes when she takes off the muzzle from the little animal's nose and while she strips two of the teats the calf takes care to empty the other two As soon as the maid has done she fixes on the instrument again but it is done in such a manner as not to hinder the calf from feeding upon the grass though it is not al∣lowed to taste the milk until the girl returns to her milking  I do not recollect whether they do it in Galloway but I have observed that it is the general practice through Scotland to milk their cows in sum∣mer three times in the day In Gal∣loway they spay more queys than perhaps in all the island besides and in this too their methods are different from any other part I am acquainted with for they do not cut them until they are a year or near a year old whereas in every other place I know the quey calves are spayed from one to three months old and indeed it is now generally admitted as the safest practice to castrate calves and lambs male or female while very young  I find the breeders in Galloway like most other breeding countries in these kingdoms complain of their old breed being lost or at least much wore out That there may be some truth in these complaints I will not  take upon me to denyBut perhaps there may be other reasons which in some measure contribute to lead people into this way of thinking In this age of improvement I appre∣hend we examine more narrowly We distinguish with more perspicuity and consequently we judge more nicely We are not content now with judg∣ing by one of our senses as I believe used to be the case  viz  by looking on slightly but we now join the sense of  feeling  to seeing The farmer of this day is not ashamed to learn from the butcher to feel with the fingers that touchstone of knowledge in regard to the judging of animals already prepared or to be prepared for the shambles We undoubtedly first judge by the sight which being pleased we bring the sense of feeling to its assist∣ance  A nice or good judge of cattle and sheep with a slight touch of the fingers upon the points of the animal  viz  the hips rumps ribs flank breast twist shoulderscore c will know imme∣diately whether it will make fat or not and in which parts it will be the fattest c    and if this also approves we then conclude that the animal suits our purpose or is answerable to the idea we had formed of it  From these and such like reasons I have been induced to believe that breeders and graziers are misled or mistaken at least in a great measure respecting the breeds of cattle c being lost and of cattle sheep c being worse now than formerly The fact I apprehend is that from our more refined notions we are be∣come worse to please and if matters go on in the right line we shall every day become nicer and clearer in our judgments of stock as well as other things How is it probable that we should lose our best breeds of cattle  or that our domestic animals should decline in real value when such a laudible spirit for the breeding of good stock everywhere prevails and such an encouragement to it for tho' our cornmarkets keep fluctuating and of late years have been in com∣mon below par in the north and east parts of Britain in proportion to the great advance in the rents of farms yet the value of black cattle and sheep have kept progressively advan∣cing so that the importation of livecattle from our sisterkingdom had not such a material effect as might have been expectedBut to return to the breeders in Galloway and even supposing their breed of cattle in some degree lost yet there is little doubt not only of its being recovered but still more improved when such a leading nobleman as Lord Selkirk is among the breeders Mr Murray of  Broughton and Mr Herring of Cor∣roughtree have been long very emi∣nent in the breeding of Galloway cattle Mr Craik Mr Dalyell and several others have tried a cross from Mr Bakewell's bulls but how far this has succeeded I have not yet been able to learn indeed I do not see how they can judge themselves with∣out a fuller trial But I found that the generality of the breeders were against crossing with Mr Bakewell's or any other kind of cattle believing that their real original polled breed had already been injured from cross∣ing with different kinds  Tho' the generality of their cattle are polled yet they have several with horns which they say are a bastard or mongrel breed from crossing with longhorned bulls from Westmore∣land and Cumberland They prefer the polled ones and of these the  black or darkbrindled ones to any other and all allow them to be the original breed of the county The general weight of their steers or oxen is from forty to sixty stone some reach seventy and upwards  KILOES or  Highland cattle  accord∣ing to our arrangement are the next to be treated ofThese hardy animals are in possession of all that extensive and mountainous country called the Highlands of Scotland together with the islands bounded on all sides by the sea and the Grampian hills which as I understand them begin on the north side of the Frith of Clyde and run into the east sea near Aberdeen All the Lowlands of Scotland except Galloway which we have already treat∣ed of have a mixed breed of cattle Towards Cumberland they are half longhorns half polls On the bor∣ders  of Northumberland they are mix∣ed with shorthorns until you reach near Teviotdale when they become altogether a coarse kind of shorthorns or what the Yorkshire jobbers call Runts except a few pretty good shorthorned cattle bred in that pleasant and fine country the Tweedside This same kind of runtish coarse breed continues all the way to the Frith of Forth Crossing this narrow sea into Fifeshire you would at first imagine the Fife cattle a distinct breed from their upright white horns like a Welsh ox being exceedingly lightlyered and thinmade but I am pretty clear it is only from their being more nearly allied to the kiloes and consequently less of the coarse kind of shorthorns in them The cattle all along this coast continue to change more and more growing still less until upon the edges of the mountains they become  quite kiloes but still much inferior to that pure unmixed valuable breed of kiloes which we meet with in the more northern and West Highlands and all the islands but particularly the Isle of Skye and that tract of country called Kintail It is in these two noted places that you meet with the native breed of kiloes a hardy industrious and excellent breed of cattle in every respect calculated to thrive in a cold exposed mountainous country When these are taken south and grazed they both feed very rea∣dily and afford remarkable good beef their colours are black brin∣dled or dun in general but the breeders here like the Galloway people prefer the black ones  Prodigious numbers of these cattle are every autumn drove to the south∣ward Many of them are bought up by that great dealer Mr Birkwhistle  for that western district of Yorkshire called Craven many more are sent into Norfolk Suffolk Essex and other parts of the south of England where they are fatted and either slaughtered at their homemarkets or sent to Smithfield The demand for kiloes into England is of vast importance to the Nobility and Gentry who have estates in the North of Scotland as the most of their rents are paid in live cattle The weight of these cattle runs in general from twenty to thirtyfive stone some particular ones reach to more than forty  THE  French  or  Alderney  breed of cat∣tle are only to be met with about the seats of our Nobility and Gentry up∣on account of their giving exceeding rich milk to support the luxury of the teatable Indeed if it was not for the sake of method and my be∣lieving  them a distinct breed I might have saved the trouble of naming them at all as I imagine this breed too delicate and tender ever to be much attended to by our British farmers for they are not able to bear the cold of this island particularly the northmost parts of it They are very fineboned in general lightred or yellow in colour and their beef generally yel∣low or very highcoloured tho' very fine in the grain and wellflavoured They make themselves very fat and I never remember seeing one of them in the least subject to lyer or blackfleshed and I have seen some very useful cattle bred from a cross be∣tween an Alderney cow and a shorthorned bull  WE come now to the  sixth  and  last  distinct breed of cattle according to our opinion to be met with in this  island  Except the Sussex and Devonshire breeds which as I said before I am unacquainted with    viz The Wild Breed  These from being untameable can only be kept within wallsconsequently but a very few of them are now to be met with preserved out of curiosity by some of our Nobility they are so absolutely wild that those I have seen could not be come so near to as to form a proper judgment of them These were all over of a creamy or dimmish white except the ears which are red their hair long and thick all over them horns milkwhite and stand as upright as those upon a Welsh bullockAs soon as we came near them they fled to a confiderable di∣stance then turned suddenly round and set themselves as in battlearray facing us knocking their horns one against another  We were told by the parkkeeper that they always conceal their calves  from the first dropping of them which would be very difficult to find if he was not to watch the dam early or late when she goes privately to give it suck after which it immediately claps down again among brakes rushes c while she steals away with great cautionWe were also told that they feed well that the beef is finegrained and wellflavoured and in∣deed their form denotes kindly flesh from what we could judge  I had almost forgot to observe that when the parkkeeper wants to castrate a calf having previously well marked the place where it is hid he goes very softly till he seizes his prey then after making as short work as possible he runs to his horse which is hooked as near as can be and rides for his life for the first noise of the calf brings not only the dam but the whole hord instantly  and he told us that he sometimes escaped very narrowly as it makes them quite outrageous the shooting of them is also attended with danger  Chillingham in Northumberland a Seat be∣longing to the Earl of Tankerville is the only place where I have seen this curious wild breed tho' I am told some others of our Nobility have of them  HAVING given a kind of history of the different breeds of cattle made use of in this island we shall now ac∣cording to promise endeavour to point out the perfections and imperfections of each  First  then the longhorns are most remarkable for and different from the other kinds in the length of their horns the thickness and firm text∣ure of their hides the length and thick∣ness of their hair size of their hoofs and coarse leathy thick necks they likewise are deeper made in their fore∣quarters and lighter in the hind quar∣ters  than the other breeds in general they are narrower in their shape less in point of weight than the shorthorns though better weighers in pro∣portion to their size and give consi∣derably less milk though it is said to afford more cream in proportion they are more varied in colour than any of the other breeds but whatever the colour is they have in general a white streak or lace along their back which the breeders term  finched  They are understood by graziers to be in ge∣neral rather flowfeeders except that particular kind distinguished and re∣commended by Mr Bakewell these are said to eat less food than the others make remarkably fat in a short space of time and lay their fat upon the most valuable parts but have little tallow in them when fed and when used to the dairy give very little milk It is also observable that this kind  differ from the rest of the longhorn∣ed cattle in having very fine clean small bones in their legs and very thin hides The shorthorns differ from the other breeds in the short∣ness of their horns being wider and thicker in their form or mould con∣sequently feed to the most weight but the most essential difference con∣sists in the quantity of milk they give beyond any other breed their being tenderer than the other kinds the Alderney excepted may probably be owing to giving such a large quantity of milk Indeed they have in general very thin hides and much less hair upon them than the other sorts Al∣derneys always to be excepted they also afford by much the most tallow when fattened It is said of this kind and I suppose very justly that they eat more food than any of the other breeds nor shall we wonder at this  when we consider that they excel in those three valuable particulars  viz  in affording the greatest quantity of beef tallow and milk Their colours are very much varied but the gene∣rality are red and white mixed what the breeders call  flecked  and when properly mixed is a very rich fine colour  Speaking of the colours of neat cattle reminds me of a conjecture which I will take the liberty of mentioning In all the accounts of cattle relative to this island which I have seen either in deeds or lawstatutes they are called  black cattle  Now I would only ask whether this does not strengthen that opinion of the shorthorned breeds being intro∣duced from the Continent perhaps some time after our seacoasts and lowcountry was improved and in∣closed and before that period is it  not probable we had mostly the small black cattle which still are to be met with in all the wild mountainous un∣cultivated parts of Wales and Scot∣land  NOW we will speak of the  Gallo∣way Breed  or  Polled Cattle  This va∣luable breed seems to be about as much less in weight and size to the longhorns as these are to the shorthorns but they differ most essen∣tially from every other breed of cattle in having no horns at all Some few indeed in every other respect polls have two little unmeaning horns two three or four inches long hanging down loose from the same parts that other cattle's horns grow from and are joined to the head by a little loose skin and flesh and are somewhat curious In almost every other re∣spect except wanting horns these  cattle resemble the longhorns both in colour and shape only they are short∣er in their form which probably makes them weight less Indeed their hides seem to be between the two lastmentioned breeds not so thick as the longhorns nor so thin as the shorthorns but like the best feeding kind of the longhorns they lay their fat upon the most valuable parts and their beef is more mixed with fat or marbled than the shorthorns in ge∣neral  THE  Kiloes  come next in course These are still less in proportion to the polled cattle than they are to the longhorns or those to the shorthorns These also are covered with a long thick coat of hair like the polls and longhorns and like these their beef is finegrained wellflavoured and mixed or marbled but not so  handsome on the outside of the beef when killed and not of so bright a colour but are often spotted with black even upon the best parts ex∣cept when made very fat Neverthe∣less these are a most valuable breed of cattle and better adapted perhaps to the cold regions where they are bred than any other kind we are ac∣quainted with However Admiral Sir John LockhartRoss and some other spirited Gentlemen have tried some crosses between longhorned bulls and the Isle of Skye cows Whether this will answer the end desired or not time will shew but whatever the result may be there is certainly great merit in the attempt  As we have now gone through the perfections and imperfections of these four kinds of cattle which I pre∣sume are the most worthy the atten∣tion  of our farmers graziers and breeders for I apprehend the Alder∣ney and wild cattle are out of the question for reasons before given we will beg leave to make a few com∣parisons and observations before we conclude this subject and in doing this we shall begin with the Kiloes first for reasons which will appear afterwards  But previous to that I would ob∣serve that though a breed of cattle may have much merit and suit some particular districts exceedingly well and better perhaps than any other kind we know of yet it would be very absurd to assert that they would answer as well in every part of the country or even in those parts wherein they have not yet been tried and ad∣mitting that in some of those parts they might answer exceedingly well yet who will pretend to say that they will suit in all  From these considerations I think my experienced Readers will readily agree with me that though this very useful breed of little cattle suit so well upon the bleak hills in the North as not to be in danger of being outdone by any other breed yet that it would be very absurd to suppose they will answer to breed in those rich grounds by the riversides or in the fertile plains in our midland countries bet∣ter than the breeds already made use of in those parts  Let us then leave this industrious and hardy breed in quiet possession of their own mountains and consider how far this will hold good with the polled cattle  Although I am very clear in what has been said about the kiloes yet I will not take upon me to say that the right Galloway cattle would not do in the best breeding grounds we have  because I confess that I have a very high opinion of this breed as quick true feeders and as kindly fleshed or excellent eating beef by which they have established their character in the first market in the island How they would answer as dairy cows I cannot pretend to say as I want sufficient in∣formation to judge from  Since I wrote the above I have been informed from good authority that the polled cows are very good milkers in proportion to their size and the milk good in quality which certainly adds to the value of this ex∣cellent breed that the oxen and spay∣ed heifers answer well for the draught I have good authority to assert how∣ever as there is such a similarity be∣twixt the best of these and that breed of longhorns referred to before and recommended by Mr Bakewell we will leave them and go to these longhorns  but not without first wishing that proper trials were made with these and between these the longhorns and shorthorns by breeders of judgment experience and attention in the differ∣ent breeding counties in this island  We shall now return to these two breeds of cattle the longhorns and shorthorns that are at present in possession of the best and greatest part of this island These two rivalbreeds between which it has long been a dispute with the breeders of both which are the best and most advantageous have been variously in∣termixed in different parts of Great Britain but it is the two unmixed distinct breeds that we now mean to compare and to the best of our know∣ledge in the most unprejudiced man∣ner point out their different perfec∣tions and imperfections and then leave the candid experienced reader to form his own judgment  As we have already observed the longhorns excel in the thickness and firm texture of the hide in the length and thickness of the hair and conse∣quently must be hardier in their beef being finer grained and more mixed or marbled than the shorthorns better weighers in proportion to their size and milk richer in quality for as to their horns being longer I do not think them either better or worse for that and therefore do not bring it into the account But they are inferior to the shorthorns in giving a less quan∣tity of milk in weighing less upon the whole in affording less tallow when killed being in general slower feeders and in being coarser made and more leathery or bullish in the under side of the neck In few words the longhorns excel in the hide hair and quality of the beefthe shorthorns in the quantity of beef tallow  and milk Each breed have long had and probably long may have their particular advocates but if I may hazard a conjecture is it not proba∣ble that both kinds may have their particular advantages in different situ∣ations Why may not the thick firm hides and long closeset hair of the one kind be a protection and security against those impetuous winds and heavy rains to which the west coast of this island is so subject while the more regular seasons and mild cli∣mate upon the east coast is more suit∣able to the constitutions of the shorthorns or Dutch breed I would wish to be understood that when I say the longhorns exceed the shorthorns in the quality of the beef I mean that preference is due to the particular breed of longhorns only taken notice of before as selected distinguished and recommended by that most attentive  breeder Mr Bakewell for as to the longhorned breed in common I am inclined to think their beef rather in∣ferior than superior to that of the ge∣nerality of shorthorns and there is little doubt but a breed of shorthorn∣ed cattle might be selected equal if not superior to even that very kindlyfleshed sort of Mr Bakewell's pro∣vided any able breeder or body of breeders had or would be at the same pains and pay the same attention to these that Mr Bakewell and his neigh∣bours have done to the longhorns But it has all along been the misfor∣tune of the shorthorned breeders to pursue the largest and biggestboned ones as the best without considering that those are the best that pay the most money for their keeping in a given time However the ideas of our shorthorned breeders being now more enlarged and their minds more  open to conviction we may hope in a few years to see great improvements made in that breed of cattle  I have hitherto taken no notice of the  Irish cattle  though it behoves the breeders in that island above all others in the British dominions to pay at∣tention to the breeding of cattle as beef is the staple commodity of the island and however Great Britain may have suffered it is highly pro∣bable that the Irish have been bene∣fited by the high price their beef has born during the war with America I take the Irish cattle to be a mixed breed between the longhorns and the Welsh or Scotch but most inclined to the longhorns though of less weight than those in England It is wonder∣ful to consider the numbers of cattle that fertile island produces I have seen at one fair at Ballinasloe in the  county of Rosecommon I believe thirtyfive thousand head of cattle shewn and half of these fat ones all bought up for the slaughter at Corke Of late years several of the Irish breeders have bought longhorned bulls and heifers at very high prices from Lancashire Leicestershire War∣wickshire c particularly the Mr Frenches and other spirited breeders from Rosecommon and different parts of the west of Ireland which has been of very great advantage in im∣proving their breed I saw some of the cattle descended from these crosses shewn at Ballinasloefair which were greatly superior to any others shewn there  SHEEP  THE  third  class of domestic ani∣mals which we proposed treating of are Sheep the breeding of which is of the utmost importance to this na∣tion most worthy the constant atten∣tion of the Legislature and the parti∣cular consideration of almost every farmer in Great Britain for we have very few farms in this island wherein sheep may not be kept to advantage either in the stock way in grazing or feeding fat lambsMr Pope some∣where says 'The fur that warms the Monarch warmed a bear' But the furs of these valuable creatures warm every class of people from the King to the beggar employ thousands in the manufacturing of their fleeces and whole fleets in the exportation Every subject that his Majesty has is  interested in this great staple commo∣dity from the Lord who sits upon a woolsack to the industrious poor who chearfully card and spin  The numberless flocks that are everywhere spread over the face of this island from the Land'send to Johno'Groat's house are exceedingly intermixed and varied Nevertheless the original distinct breeds that I have seen may I apprehend be reduced to seven  viz  ist the Lincolnshire breed d the Teeswater breed d the Dor∣setshire breed th and th the two breeds we find upon the borders of England and Scotland very different tho' near neighbours the one called the long sheep the other the short sheep th the dunfaced breed which is spread through the greatest part of the Highlands of Scotland th the Herefordshire breed  In regard to these seven different breeds of Sheep we shall pursue pretty nearly the same method we did with the Cattle after first giving a description of the Ram or Tupe of what I esteem the best breed  Description of the Ram  HIS head should be fine and small his face white nostrils wide and ex∣panded his eyes prominent and rather bold or daring ears short and thin his collar full from his breast and shoulders but tapering gradually all the way to where the neck and head join which must be very fine and graceful being perfectly free from any coarse leather hanging down the shoulders broad and full which must at same time join so easy to the collar forward and crops backward as to leave not the least hollow in either place the mutton upon his arm or  forethigh must come quite to the knee all his legs white and upright with a clean fine bone being equally clear from superfluous skin and coarse hairy wool from the knee and hough downwards the breast broad and well forward which will keep his forelegs at a proper wideness his girth or chest full and deep and instead of a hollow behind the shoulders that part by some called the foreflank should be quite full the back and loins broad flat and straight from which the ribs must rise with a fine circular arch his belly straight the tail well set up quarters long and full with the mutton quite down to the hough which should neither stand in nor out his twist deep and full which with the broad breast will keep his forelegs open and square the whole body covered with a fine thin rosy pelt and that with a fine long bright soft wool  WE shall now proceed to the  first  or  Lincolnshire breed  This fertile county as I have said before has the same right I suppose to be called the mothercounty or country for longwool'd sheep that Lancashire has to longhorned cattle But the compari∣son may be carried further for as this lastnamed county from paying too much attention to big bones hide and horns suffered the Leicestershire and Warwickshire breeders to steal from them their valuable breed above referred to before they were well aware of it so also the Lincoln∣shire breeders by too great a fond∣ness for heavy wool and largeboned sheep suffered the same discerning set of breeders from the midland counties to rob them of a much more valuable breed of sheep which they undoubtedly were first in posses∣sion of before they were well sensible of the value of them  It is true that the Lincolnshire breeders can justly boast of clipping the greatest weight of wool from a given number of sheep of any other set of people in this island but then this very heavy wool seldom or never fails to cover a very coarsegrained carcase of mutton a kind of mutton well known for its large grain and big bones in the London markets which not only sells for less money by the pound in the metropolis than any other kind of mutton and in every market in the island wherever they happen to be exposed to sale but has brought an odium upon the large mutton which the best kinds do not deserve  It is very well known that the mut∣ton of that breed of sheep first intro∣duced by Mr Bakewell and now spread over most parts of the island is as remarkable for the fineness of its  grain as the Lincolnshire sheep are for coarse grain the former is also as fineflavoured and sweet as a moun∣tain sheep possessing most of the good qualities of these breeds without their bad ones Yet this is not the worst of it for this kind of sheep cannot be made fat in a reasonable time in any part of the island except RomneyMarsh their own rich marshes in Lin∣colnshire or some very rich grazing grounds Perhaps this is the best rea∣son we can give for a set of sensible men so long adhering to this coarsegrained slowfeeding tribe Indeed the prodigious weight of wool which is annually shorn from these sheep is an inducement to the marshmen to give great prices to the breeders for their hogs or hogerils as they are there called which though they must be kept two years more before they get them fit for market yet in the  mean time they get three clips of wool from them which alone pays them well in those rich marshes However I am very glad to find that the prejudices of the Lincolnshire breeders are now giving way to their betterinformed reason as many of the great tupebreeders in Lincoln∣shire are now hiring and buying rams from the midland counties which is certainly the best readiest and only method to recover that va∣luable breed of sheep of which they first were in possession and which they of any other county of Great Britain can make the most advantage from having the greatest quantity of rich sheep pasturage  After what has been said will it not appear very extraordinary that not only the midland counties but York∣shire Durham and even Northumber∣land can send their longwool'd breed  of sheep to market at two years old fatter in general than Lincolnshire can at three It is a matter of fact how∣ever and I have no doubt of clearing it up to the satisfaction of my unpre∣judiced readers in a few words  The rich fat marshes in Lincoln∣shire are beyond any other county I know of in the island best adapted to the growing and the forcing of long heavy wool This with the high price that kind of wool had given previ∣ous to the late war very probably induced the sheepbreeders of that county to pursue it so ardently in preference to every other requisite that they neglected the form of the carcase and inclination to make readily fat  essentials  that the other sheepbreeding counties were under a neces∣sity of attending to or otherwise they could not have got them made fat in proper time from their land not  being in general near so rich as the Lincolnshire marshes In short the Lincolnshire breeders by running so much upon wool and large bones lost the thick firm carcase broad flat back fine clean small bone and inclination to make fat those distinguishing cha∣racteristics of our best sheep and for which the Leicestershire breed is so eminently conspicuous the introduc∣tion of which reflects so much merit upon Mr Bakewell who first faw the advantages attending this most useful breed and who has so steadily pur∣sued it that he has now established them in almost every corner of these islands for notwithstanding this breed originated in Lincolnshire the ho∣nour was reserved to Mr Bakewell of improving it to a pitch unknown in any former period  The Lincolnshire sheep were be∣come like their black horses two great  ends with a long thin weak middle But they have another breed of sheep in Lincolnshire which I believe are now much wore out still worse than the other and from whence they had them will not be easy to make out It is more than probable the large breed has come from the Continent as well as the shorthorned cattle but these seem all their own however we have none like them in this island that I know of except what have sprung from Lincolnshire The sort I refer to are absolutely dwarfs every feature is expressive of that disagreeable de∣ficiency so strongly marked in the dwarfs in our own species nor should I have named them here but as a matter of curiosity however they are well known in that county and go by the name of Dunkies or Tunkies perhaps a corruption of the word  lonquin  from which the Chinese pigs are vulgarly called Tunkies  It is necessary to observe that tho' we give the honour of the heavywool'd sheep's origin to Lincolnshire as I have said before yet I look upon those to be only variations of the same breed which are spread through most of our midland counties particu∣larly Marchland in Norfolk the Isle of Ely Northamptonshire Rutlandshire Leicestershire Warwickshire part of Oxfordshire Glocestershire Stafford∣shire and Darbyshire Nottingham∣shire and the south parts of York∣shire with all the Yorkshire wolds But when we come North towards the river Tees which divides York∣shire from the county of Durham we there find that largest breed of sheep in this island always called the Tees∣water breedThis kind differs from the Lincolnshire in their wool not being so long and heavy in standing upon higher though finerboned legs  yet supporting a thicker firmer hea∣vier carcase much wider upon their backs and sides and in affording a fatter and finergrained case of mut∣ton These sheep weigh from to  lib per  quarter some particular ones have been fed to  lb  and upwards But Mr Thomas Hutchinson of Smea∣ton an eminent breeder and grazier near the river Tees fed a wedder∣sheep which was killed about Christ∣mas and weighed no less than  lb    oz per  quarter Avoirdupois such an extraordinary weight as was never before heard of in this island by se∣veral pounds  per  quarter The ewes of this breed generally bring two lambs each season and sometimes three four or even fiveBut speak∣ing of the fecundity of these sheep puts me in mind of an account I had from a correspondent in regard to the fruitfulness of a ewe belonging to an  acquaintance of his which I will beg leave to transcribe in his own words for the satisfaction of the curious part of my Readers  Mr Edward Addison's ewe when two years old  viz  In  brought him  lambs  In      In      In      In      In      N B  The first nine lambs were lambed within eleven months  It is only right to observe that this large breed of sheep are not adapted to live in large flocks or upon bare pastures they require good ground lying thin on  viz  few together or in small parcels and great indulgence in winter Accordingly we find that in the fine tract of country by the Tees where these sheep are principally  kept the land is in general good well sheltered and cut into small inclo∣sures where they keep a very small number in the same field allow them to go to a haystack all the winter or to hecks or sheepracks well supplied in the field and very frequently give the ewes corn in troughs previous to their lambing  THE  Dorsetshire breed of Sheep  come next before us and are said to bear lambs twice yearly But I am inclined to believe this is a mistake for ad∣mitting that they may bring lambs twice in one particular year yet they cannot well do it the next year or for a succession of years or at least if they suckle their lambs I think they cannot because when it is considered that a ewe goes with lamb twentyone weeks she must consequently have only ten weeks to suckle or feed her  two different breeds before she takes the ram again which will scarce suf∣fice  Since I wrote the above I have been inform∣ed by a correspondent that the Dorsetshire ewes are capable of bringing lambs twice ayear be∣cause my friend tells me from a peculiarity in their constitution they will take the ram two days after lambing but do not conceive however eight days after that they have a second embrace when they most generally prove with lamb notwithstanding they give suck at the same time  But the peculiar property of this curious breed of sheep and what makes them so exceedingly conveni∣ent and advantageous to breed from is that you can have them to lamb at whatever season of the year you choose so as to have that particular kind of fat lamb called houselamb which is so early found at the tables of the Nobility and Gentry and even among our tradesmen in these luxuri∣ous times and which are brought to London market by Christmas or sooner  if wanted and after that a constant and regular supply is kept up all the winter At their first appearance they are frequently sold for halfa∣guinea fifteen shillings and some∣times more  per  quarter from which time they lower gradually in price until the spring affords plenty The lambs are imprisoned in little dark cabbins or cupboards where they never see the light except when the shepherd suckles them upon the ewes The ewes are fed with oilcake hay corn and turnips cabbages or any other green food which that season affords these are given them in a field or close contiguous to the lamb apart∣ments whereunto at proper times the attendant brings the nurses and while the lambs suck their lodgings are made perfectly clean and littered with fresh straw Vast attention is paid to this for very much depends upon  cleanliness Thus are invention and industry exerted to the utmost to sup∣ply the wants of luxury  It used to be said some years ago that this most singular breed of sheep would not bring lambs so early ex∣cept in the southern parts of England and that it was much owing to a par∣ticular mode of treatment practised by the shepherds and breeders in Dor∣setshire and the neighbouring coun∣ties such as heating the ewes by driv∣ing c and then turning the rams to them Others again asserted that it was owing to the particular herbage produced upon the Dorsetshire downs But these imaginary notions are now all exploded because it is well known that York Durham Newcastle and even Edinburgh are of late years supplied with Christmas houselamb from the Dorsetshire sheep without any particular arts being made use of  This breed of sheep are whitefaced and most of them have horns stand upon high small legs long and thin in the carcase and vast numbers of them without any wool upon their bellies especially in Wiltshire which gives them a very uncouth appearance to strangers They produce a small quan∣tity of wool but that is very fine in quality though it varies in different districts The mutton of these sheep is also very sweet and wellflavour∣ed The variations of this breed are spread through most of the southern counties but the true kind is only to to be found in Dorsetshire and Wilt∣shire There is a breed not unlike these in Norfolk and Suffolk which they fold on their fallows but they are all grey or blackfaced and most of those I have seen in the west  viz  Gloucestershire Worcestershire Here∣fordshire c though some of them  very different from the Dorsetshire are I apprehend only variations of this breed which variations continue northward until they are lost amongst those of the Lincolnshire breed  They have a particular breed of sheep mostly horned in that western part of Yorkshire adjoining Lanca∣shire called Craven and the Sun∣dales I know not which breed to an∣nex them to but I think they have a good deal of the Dorsetshire in them especially their horns and white faces  After leaving these to the north∣wards we first meet with that hardy blackfaced wildlooking tribe which in the borders are called the short sheep in contradistinction to that other borderbreed which we shall next treat of and generally known by the appellation of long sheep The short kind then we have observed  begin somewhere in the northwest of Yorkshire and are in possession of all that hilly or rather mountainous track of country adjoining the Irish sea from Lancashire southward to FortWilliam northward Indeed their migration into the Western High∣lands of Scotland has only been of late years nor is there the least doubt of their answering equally as well in the mountains of Argyleshire as in those of Westmoreland and Cumber∣land for it is well known that the climate is pretty much the same in all that rugged coast having almost un∣interrupted rains and strong winds Indeed the Galloway and Ayrshire sheep are in some degree different but I take it only to be a variation probably from crosses between these and the long sheep But within these few years they have in these two counties been making some trials of  that most useful kind of sheep best known by the name of the Dishley's breed and every friend to his country will be glad to hear when I now in∣form him that they have hitherto suc∣ceeded beyond expectation Nor will any person conversant with breeding sheep be surprised at this because they are in every respect as well or better calculated to thrive in the flat country and lower hills as the blackfaced ones are for the mountains  This hardy race differ from our other breeds not only in their dark complection and horns but princi∣pally in the long coarse shagged wool which grows upon these mountaineers The fleece is not unlike the hair grow∣ing upon a waterspaniel and is sel∣dom sold higher than from ½ d to d  per lib  Their eyes have a very fierce wild cast they run with astonishing agility and seem quite adapted to  these heathy mountains that run along all the west of Scotland and the northwest of England they are seldom fed until they be three four or five years old when the mutton is said to be excellent and gravy highflavoured The three great fairs for these sheep and where amazing num∣bers of them are sold every year is Stagshawbank in Northumberland Appleby in Westmoreland and Lin∣ton in Scotland I have been told that they have been trying this breed in those remote parts to the north of the MurrayFrith  viz  Rossshire Sutherland and Caithness nor is there a doubt of their answering better than the kind they have which are the last breed in our arrangement and which we shall describe by and by  But first let us give some account of the long sheep which though next neighbours to the short ones are al∣most  as different from them as sheep from goats for as the latter are horn∣ed blackfaced and blacklegged coarse shagged open wool with very short firm carcases the others on the con∣trary have long thin carcases thick planted fine tender wool whitefaced whitelegged and without horns In∣deed some few of these are speckled in the face and legs but those are a mixed breed from the two kinds be∣ing probably crossed at different times where they have been so very long neighbours For as you leave the heights of Annandale to the eastward you insensibly loose the short sheep and mixed breed after which all those extensive fine green hills on both the Scotch and English borders from Red∣water southward and on all sides of the mountains of Cheviot until you join the barren heaths of Lam∣mermuir northwards are covered  with the long breeda kind of sheep in my own humble opinion very ill calculated for a mountainous country particularly those to the southward called Redwater sheep which are formed more like a fox than a sheep Indeed the fine herbage which these border hills everywhere produce sup∣ports these sheep so well in summer as to enable them the better to stand the severity of their winters Great numbers of these sheep are sold in Yorkshire when three years old and when fed there upon turnips c have the character of what the butch∣ers call dying to their handling and affording good eating mutton their wool is so light as not to weigh more than ½ or lb  per  fleece however it fetches a pretty good priceColonel Selby of Paston in particular who has paid much attention to his wool generally sells as high as d or d  per  pound The wool of all this country for want of homemanufac∣tories either goes to Scotland even as far as Aberdeen and Peterhead or in∣to Yorkshire to Leeds Bradford c to the latter mostly by landcarriage But what is most extraordinary a part of this wool after being combed at Leeds c returns into Scotland to be spun then is conveyed back to be made into stuffs a part of which once more returns to Scotland for the people to wear However the industrious NorthBritons are now establishing woollen manufactories in every corner which I am well informed are patrio∣tically supported by the first Nobility in Scotland and it were to be wished that the Nobility and Gentry in Nor∣thumberland would imitate so laud∣ible an example Such establishments would in all probability very soon prevent these very expensive and tardy conveyances  All the low parts of Northumber∣land have a mixed breed of sheep be∣tween the long kind the Teeswater and the Lincolnshirein general a very tender aukward unprofitable breed though much better than the kind they used to breed which were properly enough called Mugs and were no other I presume than a larger kind of long sheep perhaps from their better keeping in the lowcoun∣tries for they were mugged or wool'd into the very eyes Some rem∣nants of this breed that I have seen have their wool so grown about their eyes that the poor animals could scarce see to eat or pick out the grass This mug or muff by every breeder and grazier of experience in these days is looked upon as a certain in∣dication of a soft tender slowthriv∣ing sort while the chearful open coun∣tenance without any wool upon the  face from the ears forward except what is called a  topping  always de∣notes a kindly sort and quick feeder However since Mr Bakewell's breed has made its way into Northumber∣land their sheep are very much im∣proved and they can now not only make them fat at an earlier date but help to supply Newcastle Shields and Sunderland and all those populous environs with as fat mutton as either the county of Durham or Yorkshire and a vast quantity of fat sheep as well as lambs in the season are week∣ly sold in Morpeth from the North  From the north parts of this improving coun∣ty and both sides of the Tweed because the na∣tives of Scotland not having yet learned to eat fat mutton like the pitmen and keelm  n about New∣castle induces the Borderers to send their fattest mutton to Morpethmarket rather than Edin∣burgh where the consumption of mutton is very small indeed compared with Newcastle though pretty much increased of late years    which perhaps ranks the third market in England for quantity of stock sold weekly or annually Smithfield first Wakefield second Morpeth third  On both sides the Tweed the sheep are much the same but continue to grow worse northward until we reach that extent of barren country called Lammermuir where the sheep seem a mixture between the long and short kinds but mostly inclined to the latter From hence all along that fine coast called the Lothians you meet with no sheep except a few to breed fat lambs from for EdinburghmarketFor our northern neighbours seem to have full employment for all their level fields to produce corn for homeconsumption Even Fifeshire Angus and the Mearns afford few of these innocent creatures And when we ascend the Grampian Hills we do not find them so plentifully stocked with  sheep as the Southern Hills of this kingdom Everybody who has vi∣sited these mountains must have per∣ceived this to be owing to the pastur∣age being worse in quality and less in quantity than the Southern Hills It is here however that we first meet with the  sixth  distinct breed of sheep that we have noticed in this island I know nothing of the Devonshire breed called Dartmore NatsNor was I ever in Cornwall or very little in Wales but most of the other parts I have been often in And as it may add some weight to what has been said of stock particularly sheep which have always been my favourite or hobbyhorse and to the breeding of which I have paid considerable atten∣tion for many years I can assure my Readers that I have repeatedly visited most of the sheepbreeding counties in England especially Lincolnshire  and the adjoining midland counties where I apprehend the best and most profitable kinds of our sheep are bred and where the breeders have been at more pains than in any other part of this island Whatever crosses I have seen from Lincolnshire tupes in gene∣ral did harm while on the contrary the Leicestershire ones did great ser∣vice It is true the former generally improved the wool in weight but constantly injured the carcase in form the sheep were longer in making fat and the mutton worse in quality The Lincolnshire sheep are in general a very tender kind and unfit for most other countriesAmongst these at∣tentive breeders I have spent weeks and months in different years and used every fair means to gain inform∣ation of the art and mystery of breed∣ing cattle and sheepBut to return to the Mountains of Scotland  The breed of sheep we are about to describe differ from the others in the smallness of their sizemany of them when fed weighing no more than six seven or eight pounds  per  quarterI have heard that there is a breed of sheep in Shetland not more than three or four pounds  per  quarter but the greatest difference is in the faces of these being a sort of dunnish or tanned colour and the wool being variously mixed and streaked black brown red and dun or tanned they have no hornsDr Anderson the inge∣nious Author of the Essays on Agri∣culture inclines to think that this breed is descended from or crossed by the Spanish sheep which he sup∣poses might be introduced when the Spanish Armada suffered upon these coasts Their mutton is very sweet and some of the wool exceedingly fine which with the variegated co∣lours  strengthens Dr Anderson's opi∣nion However I am much inclined to think them too tender and delicate a breed for these mountains and shall not wonder if they are a few years afterwards drove out by that hardy race of mountaineers before described and known by the title of Shortsheepa breed I apprehend the best adapted of all others in Great Britain for lingey or heathy moun∣tains and coldexposed situationsand if so what a pity they cannot be cloathed with a finer and more valu∣able fleece There is no doubt but this might be improved because it is scarce possible to make it coarserSome trials from the Dishleybreed have been made about Moffat in An∣nandale at the request of that sensible and worthy Nobleman the Earl of Hopetoun but I am very sorry to hear that notwithstanding the influ∣ence  and earnest solicitations of his Lordship the breeders are exceedingly averse to itdo and say everything they can to lessen the merit of these trialsand like all ignorant people are quite prejudiced against every kind of sheep except their own But per∣haps the laudible and spirited en∣deavours of that active Nobleman his Grace the Duke of Buccleugh may have a better effectwho ever at∣tentive to the good of his country has also been making similar trials amongst his numerous tenants in the neighbourhood of Langholm And if no other should I hope the in∣dustrious Mr Malcolm  A respectable Tenant belonging to his Grace the Duke of Buccleugh living near Langholm  will not leave this very important matter short  The Seventh or Herefordshire Breed  I HAD divided the sheep into six distinct breeds only but was advised to make the Herefordshire sheep a seventh species though in my own humble opinion they are only a va∣riation of the Dorsetshire breed and which variation has taken place from probably attending to the fineness of the wool in preference to everything else For why might not this vari∣ation happen in the Dorsetshire breed or kind by attending to fine light wool as well as the Lincolnshire have varied from their kind by attending to the growing of strong heavy wool If true in the one case I see no reason why it may not in the otherIndeed I have no doubt but the Teeswater or Durham sheep were originally from the same stock or tribe as the Lincolnshire breed but by attending to size  c rather than wool they have by pursuing that idea become quite a different species or breed of the same kind  But to return to the Herefordshire sheepAs the late worthy Baronet Sir Charles Turner was so kind a few years ago as to inclose me an account of this breed of sheep and manage∣ment from a gentleman in that county I cannot do better than give it in his own words  An Account of Herefordshire Ryeland Sheep  Queries  What sort of ground are the sheep bred onHow are the lambs winteredon hay or green fodderAt what age are the sheep killedwhat weight of fleshditto of wooland com∣mon priceHow are the lambs summeredhow the sheep whe∣ther on commons or inclosures  "Any sort of dry sound land that is healthful for other sheep but this sort will not require so good keep as large sheep and will pick the fallows cleaner suppose double the quantity may be kept either on fallow stubble or poor pastureland"  "The lambs when weaned from the ewes about midsummer are put upon old clover and ryegrass or dry pastureland and wintered the same except snow or very severe weather when they have a little hay or peasehalm observe not to give the lambs very good keep after they have been from the ewes a month till winter when they will require a better keep old clover wheat stubble or dry pas∣ture and the oftner their pasture is changed the better"  "The wedders are generally put from the storesheep at Michaelmas when they are past three years old  kept well the winter and slaughtered fat the next summer at four years old Some turn them to feed sooner but that is when the stock is too large for the keep The sheep certainly feed better at four years old than sooner and the flesh better indeed they are put to feed at any time of the year that suits the owner but should be near fat before winter or turned off to feed as above then they are put to turnips or good dry pasture and changed often sometimes kept in the house and fed with hay and oats with some water always in a trough by them which last is expensive but the mutton excellent the weight of the flesh from to pounds A Rye∣land sheep that will weight lb when good fair mutton is often fed till he weighs lbThe storesheep that have the finest wool are kept lean and the stock together upon an  average produce about ¼ lb each sheep worth about d or d  per  pound last year it brought s  per  pound The wedders produce from to lb each and worth from to d  per  lb If the storesheep are bet∣ter kept they grow larger and pro∣duce more wool but inferior in qua∣lity"  "The lambs I have mentioned above till they are a year old when they will pasture with the flock only they should not be put in the sheepcott by night and if convenient should be kept a little better The storesheep except yearlings and twoyearolds upon the cornfarms and where the wool is finest are put in the sheepcott by night and all the year round and their cratches filled with peasehalm wheatstraw barleystraw or any other dry food which they eat and make dung of the dung enables the farm∣ers  to raise good crops of barley c and the sheep pasture by day on old clover and ryegrass dry pasture fal∣low stubble c but are always kept very lean and graze quite short when there is not convenience of putting them in the sheepcott by night all the year they do it from the begin∣ning of winter till April or May when the lambs are able to lie out by night The ewes must be kept in by night at the eaning time and when the lambs are very young or the cold nights will kill the lambs their wool is so very short but if they are healthy at a week or fortnight old they will bear to be out at night"  "The sheep are pastured upon com∣mons open fields or inclosures pro∣vided the land is dry and healthy for sheep and when there is no conve∣niency of putting them in a sheepcott by night at caning time The  sheep must not be quite the finest sort of wool but mixed with a stronger wool it will then be more in quan∣tity though about d a pound less in value and if the ewes can be out of doors the lambs bear the cold better but if they cannot be put in the house at that time should be seen often and put where they are best sheltered from the cold"  MR PYE a Herefordshire farmer also told me that the store or keepingsheep are put into cotts at night win∣ter and summer and in winter fodder∣ed in racks with peasehalm straw barleystraw c in very bad weather with hay These cotts are low build∣ings quite covered over and made to contain from one to five hundred sheep according to the size of the farm sheepwalk or flock kept The true Herefordshire breed are properly  called Ryeland sheep from the land formerly being thought capable of producing no better grain than rye being a tract of very poor land but now found capable of producing al∣most any kind of grainThey give only ½ lb to the stone of wool which was sold last year for s and Mr Pye never remembered it be∣ing sold for above s which is a higher price by much than any other wool I know of in these islands  THERE is a polled breed of sheep in Devonshire which may be an  eighth  sort but as I am unacquainted with them shall say nothing more about them They are called  Dartmore Natts  Natt is to be understood for polled humbled or without horns  IT is curious enough in travelling through the different counties in this  island how highly satisfied in general and convinced each separate district is of having the best stock for ac∣cording to the vulgar phrase every distinct county has 'the best in England' Selfsatisfied with this nar∣row illiberal idea they rest contented without a wish for further improve∣ment until some one adventurer of a more enterprizing spirit than his neigh∣bours led on by an unknown impulse makes his way into a distant part of the kingdom where he unexpectedly is struck with a breed of neatcattle or sheep c confessedly superior to any at home or that he had ever seen before After a proper consideration he buys or hires some of these bene∣fits the neighbourhood where he lives by the introduction of a more va∣luable breed of animals than they had hitherto been acquainted with which by degrees spread themselves through the country  The Author cannot illustrate the above in a better or stronger manner than by the relation of an anecdote concerning himself which tho' dis∣graceful at the period when it hap∣pened proves the misfortune of a narrow education and illiberal ideas "An elder brother of the Author's and also bred to rural business more than twenty years ago happened by chance to take a journey into the mid∣land counties On his return he was relating with great candour how much better the sheep were in Leicestershire than any we hadHow Sir replies the presen Writer in rather a con∣temptuous tone will you pretend to say that there are any sheep to be found so good as what we have in this neighbourhood You must not make me believe this neitherWell Well George rejoins my elder and truly wiser brother I hope to be able to prevail on my father to allow you to  go up next year and I am not afraid but you will come home a convert The fact was that George went and not only returned a convert but like most  turncoats  a more zealous advo∣cate for the new cause than the old one"I beg the Reader's pardon for this digression but I was led to it by reflecting upon the absurdity of narrowminded people in all coun∣tries and the hindrance it is to the progress of knowledge for I am afraid there are many at this day as wedded and begotted to old mistaken opinions as the Author was twentyfive years ago But if the best and wisest of men have been unable to remove the prejudices and obstinate opinions of mankind it may be asked what right has one farmer to expect to correct the errors of his brethren be he ever so desirous I answer as the intention is good it is to be hoped that it may have some effect  But as a confirmation of what I have been saying allow me to ac∣quaint you with the absurd opinions of many of our more southern breed∣ers from whom we should reasonably have expected better as being nearer the metropolis from whence we look for wisdom and knowledge  A Norfolk sheepbreeder says sheep should be blackfaced and blacklegged and that their horns should come out forward and turn in such a manner as you can see the ears through or behind the circle of the hornsA Wiltshire sheepbreeder on the contrary says that sheep should have  white  faces and  white  legs and that their horns shall come out back∣wards in such a manner that the ears may be seen before the hornsBut a Sussex breeder insists upon it that they are both wrong because sheep should be  grey  faced and  grey  legged  and have no  horns  Thus you see how perfectly different these noted people are in their opinions and they surely cannot all be right though they most assuredly think so But the counties are not more variable in appearance than the breeders are in opinion opi∣nions founded in absurdity and re∣pugnant to every principle of com∣mon sense Nay I was told that the coming out of the horns an inch near∣er or an inch further from the ears of a ram made at least five guineas difference in his price  On asking a butcher's wife at Bury in Suffolk how she sold muttonFive∣pence  per lib  Sir answered she smartly And pray replied I rather surprised at the high price have you no mutton below fivepence O yes Sir rejoins the honest woman plenty of Lincoln∣shires at d and ½ d but we do not account it mutton when compared  with our Norfolk or Suffolk mutton And if I dare speak out my poor opi∣nion they would neither of them be accounted mutton in many markets even further North in this island the Lincolnshire on account of its coarse∣ness the other on account of the thinness and both for having too much bone in proportion to the meat For I aver that no largeboned animal will feed so quick or cover so readily and thick with muscular flesh as one with a small bone if well formed This is the criterionthis is the main principle that we found our judgment upon respecting all animals which are to be fatted for the slaughter or the consumption of mankind and we can justly say that this judgment is confirmed by more than thirty years experience But notwithstanding this assertion is made with some degree of positiveness yet we are not uncon∣scious  of its being a  new doctrine  to the generality of the breeders in this island and consequently will appear surprising and strange to many old breeders and graziers or feeders But I have not a remaining doubt if they will only make fair candid trials the small bones will win or gain the prize nine times out of ten or rather every time Nay I am inclined to think that the fine smallboned true pro∣portioned animal will pay ½ d per∣haps d while the bigboned one will only pay d for what it eats and in that proportion When I assert this I would wish to be understood that I mean from the time of calving or lambing to the time of killing for the market because permit me to say that I look upon the grazier who buys in and feeds and he that breeds and feeds those he breeds as two very different people It is the latter of  these that the world is obliged to for those nice but valuable distinctions of smallboned animals excelling largeboned ones in feeding He sees watches and examines the various pushes and improvements from the beginning to the ending while the grazier who buys in his stock is easy in a great measure how they are bred so long as they pay him for feeding A plain coarse ugly animal may pay him more than a fine wellmade one be∣cause he buys the coarse one at much less price in proportion and it is of little consequence to him as an indi∣vidual But to his country to the community at large it is a matter of prodigious importance much more than has in general been thought of because the more meat and less bone you can produce from a given quan∣tity of pasturage of turnips cabbage c the better surely and the more  mouths you must feedWell but give me leave to return for a few mo∣ments to the Norfolk or Suffolk mut∣ton or indeed any of these sheep that are to be met with in most of the south∣ern counties I mean all those that are formed more like deer than sheep Do not be surprised when I tell you that a person who has been bred amongst the sheep in the midland counties I mean the longwool'd polled sheep in general and had never seen any of these deerlike sheep until by accident a drove happens to pass the country where he lives would never take them to be sheep but would suppose them to be a species bred between the goat the deer and some foreign sheep for their legs are so very long and their bodies so exceedingly small which with their large horns and low necks gives them an appearance altogether uncouth and totally different from the  polled sheep with long wool Last winter we measured the horns of some of the Norfolk and Suffolk rams and found them from to inches long following the turn of the horn and or ½ round at the root or setting on at the head and indeed a very formidable appearance ten or a dozen of these animals make together  Well but we were told that these longlegged long smallbodied sheep are possessed of many good qualities that the longwool'd sheep are not In the  first  place they are better tra∣vellers which I will not deny for many flocks travel a round of three four or five miles every day from and to the fold again This I am wil∣ling to believe and it may also be very right but as I never considered exer∣cise conducive to feeding tho' it may to health I shall not adopt this idea They may want them to live long and  if so they are right to give them proper exercise Our's on the contrary we wish to be fat as soon as possible or in fact never to be lean if we can help it consequently do not care how little exercise they getdly They say these sheep are less subject to the itch than our's This may also be true and from the small quantity of wool they grow I should think them easier cured of that disorderdly and  lastly  They excel our's in quantity and rich∣ness of gravy what they call  claret  coloured gravy This I also give up nor do I envy them in this mutton at all for in proportion as your mutton is fat or lean in such ratio I believe will be the gravy the more lean the blacker or claretcoloured the fatter the mutton the lighter coloured and more oil among the gravy in short the more deerlike the sheep are as I said before or the more they incline  to venison I believe the higher colour∣ed the gravy is and on the contrary the more they incline to mutton the lighter coloured and more oil And further the gravymutton is always opengrained and porous the fat mut∣ton on the contrary closegrained and firm  And now Mr Reader you shall be proprietor or landlord I your tenant and sheepbreeder and that in fact is my situation I will not object to your keeping and eating that kind of mut∣ton and I am sure you will wish bet∣ter to your tenant than find fault with him for breeding and feeding the fat kind with oily gravy For these ob∣vious reasons because you have no rent to payI have therefore tho' you may indulge your palate with claretcoloured gravy I am sure you will indulge me with the fat gravy and solid meat for myself and family  that the plowmen may be able to work for turnips to feed more of this fat mutton but above all that I may be able to pay my rent and keep the wolf from the door The fact is Mr Reader or Mr Landlord that while the venison mutton pays threepence for breeding and feeding the other will pay fourpence And until you Gen∣tlemen will make it our interest to produce the former we certainly shall produce the latter because it clearly is and ever will be the interest of the farmer and breeder to pursue that mode which turns to the best account that culture which produces the most profitable crops and to produce those animals which pay the most for what they cat Ask the pitman the keel∣man the woolcomber the weaver the fabricators of metals and all those various but valuable classes of manu∣facturers which abound in different  parts of this island which of the two kinds of mutton they prefer Would they not readily answer Take you the lean meat largeboned and black gravy but give us the smallboned fat with oil swiming in the dish And are not these the men that make the greatest consumption in fat mutton beef c  On going to market one day to sell our fat sheep I was overtaken by a Gentleman from Scotland Farmer said the Gentleman you make your sheep so fat that I could not eat the mutton It matters not Sir replied I because we have plenty of customers for this kind of mutton and allow me to say it is very happy that the great consumption does not depend upon such as you Upon my word Sir said he I believe you are very right In exact proportion as your breed of sheep approaches to the fat  kind the mutton is not only marbled or mixed with fat in the lean or lyer but the mutton is covered with fat over every part On the contrary the other sort only covers with fat very partially on particular places and little or none mixed with the lean if it did it would be a misfortune because the gravy would be spoiled  But I had almost forgot one reputed excellence of the gravy sheep It is said they die fuller of fat on the in∣side I grant they do but dispute its being an excellence upon the whole I will endeavour to explain myself It is a wellknown fact to all expe∣rienced feeders or graziers that those animals which lay the fat on quickest on the outside have the least within in proportion but then they are the very sort that pay the most for keep∣ing and consequently that sort that pay the most for keeping though  they have the less fat on the inside excel those that have more fat with∣in in exact proportion as they pay more in a given time for what they eatBut some will say the butcher has the most profit upon those that tallow best or lay the fat within I say not because if you will allow the butcher the same profit upon the quick feeders or those that put the fat on the outside he will always buy these because he can sell two joints for one and surely you can better afford to do this to the butcherBut the fact is the butcher can always buy these lean lumbering coarse ani∣mals that lay little fat without and much within for so much less  per  stone that they afford him a profit But surely this can be no inducement to either breeding or feeding them con∣sequently no excellence but the con∣trary Perhaps some Readers may  think I have dwelt longer upon these dry disquisitions than was necessary but I flatter myself the experienced Reader will excuse me when he reflects of what great importance it is to the community at large and individuals in particular to breed useful rather than unuseful animalsI confess this consideration made me very soli∣citious to impress the idea strongly upon the minds of my brother breed∣ers For if one species of wheat of oats barley or of turnips c are better worth propagating than an∣other surely it will hold good in ani∣mals and there can be no doubt that the more it is considered the more it will be attended to  I will beg leave to make a few re∣marks on beef and mutton when ex∣posed to sale in pieces on the shambles or stallWhen we consider that the  difference between what is called the coarse and fine or the best and worse parts of beef when cut up is not less than one hundred  per cent  of what vast consequence then must it be to the breeder to propagate those cattle that have the greatest proportion of these valuable parts And if I am right in what I said before it will follow that the smallboned truepro∣portioned cattle are the very sort that produce more fine than coarse that lay their fat upon the valuable parts and always feed in much less time than the bigboned coarse sort  But it is not so with mutton the difference in value between one joint of mutton and another is scarce worth naming In different parts of the kingdom they give a preference to particular joints but the variation is seldom more than a farthing or half∣penny  per  pound at most Neverthe∣less  it is still right for the breeder to pursue that species which pay most for what they eat and these I appre∣hend will always be found to be the smallboned trueformed sheep as de∣scribed before For they not only pro∣duce the finestgrained mutton but more of it in a given time in propor∣tion to offal than any other sort of sheep I know ofBut in speaking of offal here I would be understood to mean further than what the butchers generally do By offal they mean hide and tallow only in neat cattle or skin and tallow in sheep and so on But by offal in this place I would take in not only hide or skin and tallow but bones horns pelts in sheep  There is sometimes not less than lib weight difference between the pelts of one sort of sheep and another between the fine thin pelt and the thick coarse gummy one  blood guts and garbage and even wool and hair And however new the idea  I believe it will in general be found that the truer and finer the form of an animal the better quality and greater the quantity of flesh when fatted and in proportion not only less hide or skin and tallow but less bone horn pelt blood guts and garbage and even wool and hair And on the contrary the clumsier and coarser the form the flesh will in general be of a worse quality and less in quantity when fatted and in exact proportion not only more hide or skin and tal∣low but more bone horn c  Upon this principle suppose two bullocks or two sheep are fatted to∣gether no matter whether upon pa∣sture clover turnips or what you please the one as remarkable for coarseness as the other for fineness or in any proportion you will it will always hold good in that proportion and admitting the coarse one eats only  as much as the other tho' I have no doubt of his eating more still a con∣siderable part of his food must go to the support of more hide or pelt bones c while the other's food is principally converted into animal flesh which flesh on an average call only worth d  per  lib I am afraid the horns bone pelt c are not worth above a farthing  per  lib consequently a very great loss to the community Indeed the hide of a bullock is some∣times worth as much  per  lib as his flesh and particularly firm strong hides what are generally called lea∣ther hides are worth more perhaps d  per  lib but then these very thick hides almost generally cover a very slowfeeding carcase And tho' the coarse hairy wool is always worth something  per  lib yet that coarse hairy wool cannot grow but upon a thick gummy pelt which necessarily  covers a coarsegrained slowfeeding carcase of mutton The pelt itself tho' perhaps from to lib weight nay some have been known to weigh lib or more not worth more than d or d for the thinner the pelt the more valuable  THE folding of sheep in many parts of this island is looked upon as a mat∣ter of considerable consequence to the farmer I confess I cannot see it in so advantageous a light but as it is a matter I have not experienced in a very great degree I would be cautious of condemning a practice so univers∣ally used in many of the sheepbreed∣ing counties in this kingdom How∣ever so far as we can go with safety we may venture to make a few ob∣servations and these observations I would wish to be understood as re∣specting single farms only exclusive  of any right of commonage or ad∣jacent open fields cIf your farm is inclosed or put only into shifts or any other divisions it matters not we must suppose your flocks depa∣stured upon some part of the farm for instance say the field A and are folded every night upon B Now I think in proportion as they enrich B they must rob or impoverish A or if they eat all day upon the field C and lodge at night in D it is the same thing and so on wherever they eat and sleep Only I will admit it a convenience and a present advantage that supposing B field fallow and intended for tur∣nips c while perhaps you have not a sufficiency of manure to spread upon it all in that case folding your storesheep upon the fallow is perhaps getting you a crop of turnips where they might not otherwise be had for well I know that it is not easy to get  turnips upon many grounds without manure and this matter we frequently have practised tho' still it is  robbing the church to thatch the choir  But if you have a common or open field near be doing with all my heart and rob on for somebody will be doing it for you if you do it not However if the common open field c be at a considerable distance you perhaps lose as much as you gain for march∣ing sheep to and from their pasture several miles every day must neces∣sarily hurt them much and if this is to be the case I suppose the deerlike thin sheep may be the best for this purpose as being probably better able to bear the fatigue of travelling day by day Nevertheless the polled longwool'd sheep are employed on this service in different parts of this island  The sheepbreeders upon the York∣shire Wolds fold these kind of sheep  on their fallows in many places from Ladyday to Michaelmas Likewise a particular friend of mine Mr Ben∣jamin Sayle of Wentbridge near Don∣caster folds his eweflock upon both grass and fallow and travels them about three miles adayand few people I believe have shewn fatter sheep than he has his ewes when fatted after having been folded while a breeding flock as well as the de∣scendents of these ewes It is no un∣common thing for Mr Sayle to sell his fat ewes in the latter end of May and in June in Wakefield market from thirtysix to forty shillings a∣piece without the wool and I hope he will excuse me when I say that this same spirited breeder has given Mr Bakewell as high as fifty guineas for the use of a ram for one season only  I should not have taken the liberty of saying so much of this respectable  breeder and his valuable sheep but because I do  think  he has more merit than any other sheepbreeder I know of on account of breeding the most valuable sheep in proportion to the land they are bred upon For every∣body that knows Wenthill will admit that there are very few worse sheepwalks in England where polled sheep are kept and those that know it not will I am persuaded find it so on enquiring In my own opinion the merit of the Dishley or Mr Bakewell's breed has not in many places been more fully proved than under the ma∣nagement of Mr Sayle It is true that they have been most successfully tried in much colder situations and some hundreds of miles further north but in no place I know of where the sum∣mer pasture is of so bad a kind of herbage  In speaking of the importance of improving the breed of these animals  we have been treating of some of my friends in the warmth of their hearts have been led to say that if those animals were improved every∣where in this island to such a pitch as we find them I am sorry to say in a few hands only and every corner of the cultivable parts of this island managed in the same spirited gardenlike manner that we meet with in some small districts here and there Great Britain would be made capable of sup∣porting three times the number of in∣habitants as at present But without being too sanguine suppose we could support only twice as many more if instead of ten we could maintain twenty millions of people only think what an amazing affair it would be and that this might be done in time there can be but little doubt very little doubt indeed  If to the most spirited cultivation of the ground and most approved  methods of breeding the animals we have been recommending equal at∣tention was paid to floating flooding or watering of grassgrounds in every part of this island wherever the si∣tuation will admit perhaps I shall not advance too much if I say that there are very few parts of this island but may in some degree be benefited by this most useful though I am a∣fraid hitherto little understood im∣provement especially in the north parts of this kingdom And many parts might have water conveyed over them on a very extensive scale and to very great advantage for every little brook or rivulet is capable of being thrown over the adjoining grounds more or less in proportion to their descent the more descent the more land you can overflow  This matter will perhaps appear of greater magnitude than people in ge∣neral  are aware of the more it is exa∣mined for I apprehend it may be said to lay the foundation of most improve∣ments in agriculture and to be the  main spring  to all the rest because if manure is accounted the  primum mobile  in husbandry and few people I be∣lieve will deny the truth of the obser∣vation I apprehend it will be found that this same watering of the ground is and may be made the source of more valuable manure than anything else I know of But what renders it still more inestimable is that it draws this manure from materials which without this process would be entirely lost or next to it because those riches that are productive of such astonishing effects as the turning water over land has are conveyed unobserved down those streams to the sea and conse∣quently lost in that vast collection of waters Now the watering of land  in a proper manner not only raises an amazing crop of hay but springeatage and lattermath edishes fog or foggages as they are differently called in different parts of this island This hay again properly consumed makes a large annual return in dung or manure which you can employ to great advantage on such parts of your farm as most need it because your watered meadow requires no other help but repeating the same process as often as necessary while it repays your expence and toil in the most grateful manner by plentiful and certain crops of hay year after year and instead of exhausting becomes richer or more productive  I am well informed that upon the watered meadows in Somersetshire they calculate twenty shillings  per  acre upon the springcatage then grow a ton and a half or two tons  of hay upon each acre beside the lattermath or aftereatage The way they reckon is this An acre will keep eight ewes and lambs which at six∣pence  per  week each couple is four shillings they eat it five weeks before laying it in for meadow which makes the twenty shillings a decent return this exclusive of all the rest  But in many of the southern and southwestern counties they employ water upon their lands to as much advantage as in Somersetshire At Dishley Mr Bakewell has im∣proved a considerable tract of poor cold land beyond anything I ever saw or could have conceived by this same mode of improvement and ever ready to communicate his knowledge to the Public he has left proofpieces in different parts of his meadows in order to convince people of the great importance and utility of  this kind of improvementParticu∣larly in one part he has been at the pains to divide a rood of ground in∣to twenty equal divisions  viz  two perches in each piece It is so con∣trived that they can water the first and leave the second unwatered or miss the first and water the second and so on through all the divisions by which contrivance you have the fairest and most unequivocal proofs of the good effect of improving ground by watering And as Mr Bakewell is so kind as shew this experimental part to any Gentleman I cannot help thinking it well worth the while of the curious and those that have leisure to visit this extraordinary place where they will see many things worthy their attention and inspection beside water∣ing meadows And those that wish to know the art of watering land with∣out going to see it will do well to  read Mr George Boswell's Treatise on watering meadows low lands c where they will see that matter ex∣plained in a very satisfactory manner  It is totally out of my way to meddle with political matters but I hope I shall not advance too much when I say that it would perhaps turn to much better account if instead of planting colonies and conquering provinces our Great Folks would turn their attention not only to the improvement of our Fisheries but in promoting the cultivation of every acre of cultivable land in these king∣doms as well as the improvement of the most valuable breeds of animals And in order to promote this matter to its greatest extent it would be pro∣per to have experimental farms in one or more parts of these islands at the expence of Government with proper superintendants and servants under  them to make every consistent trial in the various walks of cultivation so as to ascertain which are the best modes as well as a breeding farm or farms under proper regulations so as to ascertain by proper trials and com∣parisons which are the most valuable animals and best worth attending to by our farmers and breeders in their different situations in every part of these islands because if we put the lands in this island into four divisions  viz  from nothing to five shillings  per  acre from five to ten shillings from ten to fifteen and from fifteen to twenty supposing whatever is above the last rent to be adapted rather to grazing than breeding and cultivation This being the supposed case we can only have occasion for four different species of neat cattle and sheepBut some may naturally enough say that there are variety of soils such as clay  and sand c We will say that they will require five or six different species of stock but if I was to hazard a con∣jecture I should incline to think that it will be found upon trial even fewer still will do But whoever is acquaint∣ed with or has attended to the varie∣ties of stock in this island will find I will venture to say instead of five or six species of neat cattle or sheep five or six and twenty variations or more of both kinds Nevertheless I dare say my intelligent Readers will admit that the same kinds of stock which will do upon the mountainous and high parts of Scotland will also do upon the mountainous and high parts of Wales and England Like∣wise those sorts which suit the lower hills of Scotland and the north of England will also suit in Wales and I should imagine on the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds as well as  the Downs on the South of England For I apprehend downs and wolds are only different names for the same kind of rising grounds And surely those sorts of stock which will answer the end best in the lowlands plains or campaign parts in one quarter of the island will also answer the end best in those parts in every other quarterIf this train of reasoning be just it would seem as though we shall only have occasion for a very few va∣riations of stock and what these va∣riations should be I apprehend atten∣tion and application joined to a few years experience will alone discover  Since the above was printed I find that I have been in a mistake with regard to the opinion attributed to Dr Anderson above page con∣cerning Sheep which I embrace the first opportu∣nity of correctingI now understand that that Gentleman believes that the native sheep of the Scottish Islands and Northern Districts of Scotland are a distinct breed in many respects different from the sheep of Spain and in particular that the wool of these sheep is much more remarkable for a pecu∣liar silky softness than that of Spain or any other wool found in Europe that he has had occasion to observe This wool is to be found he thinks con∣siderably finer in the filament of a much longer staple and not so much crisped as Spanish wool The sheep themselves are of a much smaller size than those of Spain and are found of various co∣lours as I have remarked above    SWINE  SWINE are the  fourth  kind of do∣mestic animals which we design here treating ofThese creatures though in many respects disagreeable are of considerable importance to the com∣munity at large and to farmers in particular And in no instance per∣haps has Nature shewn her oeconomy more than in this race of animals whose stomachs seem a receptacle for everything that other creatures refuse  or but for these would be frequently entirely wasted They industriously gather up and greedily devour what would otherwise be troden under foot and wasted The refuse of the fields the gardens the barns and the scul∣lery to them is a feast  The most numerous breed of hogs in this island is that excellent kind generally known by the name of the Berkshire Pigs now spread through almost every part of England and some places of Scotland They are in general redishbrown with black spots upon them large ears hanging over their eyes shortlegged smallboned and exceedingly inclined to make readily fat The surprising weight that some of these hogs have been fed to would be altogether incredible if we had it not so well attestedMr Young in one of his Tours gives an account of one in Berkshire which  was fed to eightyone stone some odd pounds which I had often before heard of when in the South of England But as I was some time ago favoured by a correspondent with an account of an extraordinary pig which was killed in Cheshire I will beg leave to transcribe it in his own words 'On Monday the th of January a pig fed by Mr Joseph Lawton of Che∣shire was killed which measured from the nose to the end of the tail three yards eight inches and in height four feet five inches and ahalf when alive it weighed cwt qrs lib when killed and dressed it weighed cwt qrs lib or stones lib averdupoise This pig was kill∣ed by James Washington butcher at Congleton in Cheshire'  There was a breed of large white pigs with very large cars hanging over their eyes which a few years ago  were very common in many parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire They were very plain thin aukward hogs with very long legs but what distinguished them more was two wattles or dugs not unlike the teats of a cow's udder which hung down from their throats one on each side But this unprofit∣able kind have now almost everywhere given place to the more valuable breed which we have just been speaking of and which like Aaron's rod bids fair to swallow up all the rest Indeed the Chinese or black breed will always be valuable especially for roasting pigs and porkets and though they do not feed to any great weight yet they fatten amazingly fast and afford the sweetest bacon which has gained the preference everywhere amongst the niceeating people Indeed those that have not been accustomed to the very fat bacon in the southern and midland  counties the very sight of it is enough to a person with a very delicate sto∣mach who cannot behold the very fat part of it without almost sicken∣ing while the people in those coun∣ties eat it all times of the day I have frequently seen them breakfast upon it  The black breed are deservedly in great esteem and would be much more so if they were not such a mischievous race for the most attentive herding or tenting as they call it in some parts of the South can scarcely keep them from your fields of corn pease or po∣tatoes nothing will secure them ex∣cept walls or good paling  I know of only one other breed of pigs in these islands that I have ob∣served and these are the Highland or Irish breed a kind no otherwise worth naming but for distinction's sake for I am persuaded whoever is acquainted with the Berkshire or black breeds  will never throw those aside for these They are a small thinformed animal with bristles standing up from nose to tail and exceeding bad thrivers We met with considerable herds of them upon the muirs in different parts of the Highlands of Scotland picking up the wild berries especially about Thurso in Caithness  I have seen the same kind of pigs in different parts of Ireland It is a little extraordinary that the people of that very fine fertile island should not have hitherto paid more attention to the breeding of stockI have just men∣tioned their pigs their cattle I took some notice of before therefore shall beg leave to add a few words in this place in regard to their sheep a pretty large sample of which I saw at the great fair of Ballinasloe where the col∣lector of the tolls told me that there were shewn at that time and  that there had often been more But I am sorry to say that I never saw such illformed ugly sheep as these the worst breeds we have in Great Bri∣tain are by much superior One would almost imagine that the sheepbreeders in Ireland have taken as much pains to breed plain aukward sheep as many of the people in England have to breed handsome ones I know nothing to recommend them except their size which might please some oldfashion∣ed breeders who can get no kind of stock large enough But I will en∣deavour to describe them and leave my Readers to judge for themselves These sheep are supported by very long thick crooked grey legs their heads long and ugly with large flag∣ing ears grey faces and eyes sunk necks long and set on below the shoulders breasts narrow and short hollow before and behind the shoul∣ders  flatsided with high narrow herringbacks hindquarters droop∣ing and tail set low In short they are almost in every respect contrary to what I apprehend a wellformed sheep should be and it is to be lamented that more attention has not been paid to the breeding of useful stock in an island so fruitful in pasturage as Ire∣land Indeed the same Mr Frenches mentioned before and some other spi∣rited breeders have at very great ex∣pence and hazard imported both bulls tupes and stonehorses from England and very great improvements have al∣ready been made from these crosses I saw some of the descendents of these sheep from the English rams at the a∣bove fair and it is both extraordinary and pleasing to see how much they exceeded the native breed But a very great bar is put in the way of these islanders in the improvement of their  sheep The same law is in full force against exporting sheep into Ireland as though they were to send them to our natural enemies on the Continent I think it is a real hardship that this division of his Majesty's subjects can∣not have the benefit of improving their breed of sheep without smuggl∣ing them over Application was made to Lord Harcourt when LordLicu∣tenant of Ireland for leave to send rams over to Ireland from England offering very high security three or four times the value of the ram for his being returned into England or in case of death a proper certificate to be produced along with his skin earmarks c but without effect However to show that the fault is not in the Irish breeders but on the contrary to prove that they are ex∣ceedingly desirous to improve their breeds of stock by the help of those  from this island even at an expence that many of our breeders in Great Britain would grumble at I will lay before my Readers an authentic ac∣count of a stonecolt and some sheep sold at Ballinasloefair in the county of Galway in Ireland which was given by Mr French a gentleman of fortune and character who lives in the neighbourhood of Ballinasloe to a particular friend of mine who was so kind as to present it to me They were sold by auction in small lots the th of October  ewes sold to different people a∣mounted to L        rams        ramlambs      ½  stonecolt years old               ½  One of these rams was sold to Coll Pearse  at guineas  ewes to John Bodkin  at ditto  ditto to Bar Rochfort  at ditto  ditto to Coll Pearse  at ditto  ditto to Mr Blake  at ditto  Since Mr French gave the above ac∣count to the Gentleman from whom I had it I have had the pleasure of seeing him in Ireland I also met with Mr Johnson brother to the person who sold the above goods who gave me the same relation of this affair as Mr French did  HAVING now to the best of my knowledge and according to what I proposed given an account of those domestic animals in the breeding of which our farmers are so deeply in∣terested in particular as well as the kingdom at large I will beg leave to add a few general remarks before I proceed farther  In the  first  place then it would seem that the largest domestic animals are not the best or most advantageous to the breeder and feeder because we generally find that the large bigboned cattle and sheep require more and better food in proportion to sup∣port and feed them than those of a middling size and small bones and the larger bigger boned and clumsier they are formed the more unprofit∣able they are while on the contrary the truer they are formed and the finer the bone the more profitable as they not only take less food in pro∣portion but feed readier The beef or mutton is finergrained and sells higher by the pound it is worth more to the consumer than the other be∣cause it affords more and better flesh and less bone Nay and supposing the poor are under a necessity of buy∣ing the coarse parts in a dear time  it is worth more to them in propor∣tion than the coarse of the largeboned ones because tho' still coarse it is finer than the others and has less bone in fact it is the cheapest and best eating to the rich to the ma∣nufacturer and to the poor  Even in regard to horses intended for the draught or saddle those I pre∣sume are the best in general that are of the truest proportion in respect to bone carcase or form and of a  middling  size It may be admitted that the great aukward lumbering horses from hands to may be the properest for drays or stagewag∣gons c But we know that size is unfit for the saddle the cart or the plough and where one is wanted for the former purposes I suppose five are wanted for the latter perhaps from to hands are the most service∣able or to come nearer I fancy we  shall find the best from hands inches to hands inches but perhaps it is not very easy to ascer∣tain this to any great degree of exact∣ness nor may it be absolutely neces∣sary  However this I think we may ven∣ture to assert that in those kinds of animals now under our consideration and perhaps in most others there is a certain symmetry or proportion of parts which are best adapted to a par∣ticular size in each kind All those of each kind that are above this pitch or size we find disproportioned ac∣cording to the size they attain to and in the degree that they are advanced beyond this line of perfection we find them less active less strong in pro∣portion and always less able to en∣dure hardship or fatigue We find all great horses tire sooner than middlingsized ones they are slower in motion  they are more subject to disorders or complaints and consequently wear sooner out  In cattle or sheep we in general find the largest the tenderest most liable to complaints require more and nicer fare are slower in feeding and worse butchermeat when fed they stand winters or inclement seasons much worse than the wellproportioned ones It is these wellproportioned handsome animals that we would recommend to the attention of the breeders to choose both males and females from if possi∣ble or as near to them as may be It perhaps has been owing to the idea of largeness or the wish to breed the biggest in the different kinds of our domestic animals that has so long prevented our breeders from selecting and distinguishing the most valuable kinds For so universal was this idea and so much were we blinded by it  that we did not perceive which were the most valuable animals of each kind We had no conception of any animal being valuable or good that was not great We could not separate those two ideas of good and great We did not attend to that symmetry and pro∣portion which so essentially character∣ise the valuable kinds of each species and which seldom or never fail of be∣ing the hardiest best able to bear fa∣tigue and the best thrivers In short it was left to this age to make those nicer distinctions which constitute the able breeder and discerning judge which the more they are attended to and examined the more they will be pursued and in consequence of which improved notions our breeders must now necessarily follow those kinds that are most valuable  Much has been said of late years about shortlegged stock being the  best particularly cattle and sheep nothing would go down once but short legs That little shortlegged dwarfish breed of sheep so much tho' undeservedly run upon a few years ago are very properly called by a con∣siderable breeder an acquaintance of mine "the Gentlemen's sheep" for though to those who are not judges they have a pretty enough appearance they will not bear examining by an attentive and able judge I mean he who judges by his fingers as well as his eyesa method that is out of the Gentleman's line These origi∣nated in Lincolnshire but are now almost entirely disused for very good reasons  I would wish to be cautious in con∣tradicting a general notion or re∣ceived prevailing opinion But we sometimes find the most prevailing opinions wrong For instance what  we have just been observing of the largest and biggestboned animals not being the best tho' formerly thought so and respecting short legs tho' I ad∣mit the propriety in a degree I would wish to caution our breeders against the extreme I would have them re∣collect the old proverb that all ex∣tremes are wrong and I would beg leave to observe that the attentive breeders of this day have I appre∣hend made some notable and sensible distinctions in regard to these animals that must be fed and slaughtered for the use of mankind  viz  between what they call essentials and nonessentials They give the former title to the back and sides in particular as well as the whole proportion of the carcase always taking in the inclina∣tion to make fat The nonessentials are the legs ears horns tail c and even wool and hides for tho' these  are valuable in themselves yet they are more to be dispensed with than the back sides c For those breed∣ers and graziers who keep their minds open to conviction and reason coolly say that they have seen good carcases with thick or thin hides under long short coarse and fine wool with long short thick or thin horns or ears c but that they never saw a good car∣case without the back broad and sides round or without that proportion or symmetry in the carcase which we have endeavoured to point out in our descriptions of the bull and ram Nevertheless I must observe that tho' they have given those externals the denomination of nonessentials for di∣stinction's sake they are not to be quite disregarded because notwithstand∣ing they are not so essential yet they are very often strong marks and indi∣cations of good or bad thrivers c As for instance a thick hide seldom  covers a quickfeeding carcase or a heavy fleece a readyfeeding or finegrained case of muttonAgain fine small and straight bones in the legs are almost certain signs of a kindly breed and finegrained beef or mut∣ton  c  Thus we find the thick pelts and heavy wool in Lincolnshire cover the coarsestgrained mutton that we know of while a variation of the same breed in Leicestershire highly improved have considerably less wool and very thin pelts are quicker feed∣ers and mutton as finegrained and sweet as a mountain sheep  Tho' it may seem very extraordi∣nary to the uncurious and unobserv∣ing yet it is a fact well known to the attentive breeder that in general all our best and most valuable kinds of stock in England are found upon the middling and worst grounds and not upon the best lands as we should na∣turally imagine And the reasons why  it is so are simple and obviousThose of the middling and indifferent tracts of country are under the necessity of producing an industrious and thriv∣ing breed of animals because a large tender bigboned kind could not sub∣sist upon their keeping or the pro∣duce raised upon such lands while the good land makes up for every deficiency or at least so far blinds the imagination of the unthinking breeder that he plumes himself upon having stock superior to his industri∣ous neighbours while the merit con∣sists in the goodness of his land and the richness of his pasturage and pro∣duce Satisfied with his stock being the largest he also concludes that they are the best while his more ac∣tive and industrious neighbour from being situated in a less fertile soil is obliged to seek out for a hardy thriv∣ing breedAnd this again makes me recur to the Lincolnshire breeders  who have so long stuck to such coarse unprofitable kinds of stock both cattle and sheep the pasturage in a great part of that county exceeding any other I am acquainted with in this island For what other county have we possessed of ground that will thro' summer sufficiently support six eight and even ten large sheep from to lib a quarter upon an acre or one ox and five large sheepNay I was told by some Lincolnshire farmers when dining with them at Lowth that near to Boston a place I never did visit there are some grounds which maintain or sheep upon an acre all the summer  Since the above was written the Author has visited that rich part of Lincolnshire above re∣ferred to and found that the common mode of stocking the pastures in that fertile district is seven sheep and halfabeast  per  acre that is in other words fourteen sheep and one beast on two acres thro' summer and five sheep on two acres during winter    RABBITS  and other Domestic Animals of less note  AS it may be expected from a Trea∣tise on Live Stock or Domestic Ani∣mals that besides horses neat cattle sheep and swine something should be said on rabbits mules asses goats deer and even poultryFor the sake of method then I shall beg leave to say that tho' these do come under the idea of domestic animals yet I con∣fess myself so totally unacquainted with their respective merits that it would be very wrong in me to at∣tempt a history of them Indeed as far as I know few of them are of much importance to farmers in gene∣ral tho' in particular situations I be∣lieve they may be  Of Rabbits  I know of large tracts of poor light soils in many different parts of this kingdom that are employed in rabbitwarrens and no doubt may be of great advantage to individuals as well as to the community at large for both the flesh and fur of these little creatures are of considerable value I was told when in Lincolnshire last year that many parts which had formerly been employed or stock∣ed with rabbits and then plowed for some years were now again convert∣ed into rabbitwarrens from their being convinced by experience that these little animals made a better re∣turn upon those poor light soils than the plough Indeed I was told that the fur of the rabbit was now much more valuable than some years ago and the skins of the Lincolnshire rabbits  are particularly estimable from their being mostly silvergreys the down being black and white hairs nicely mixed  Of Mules  MULES are undoubtedly very hardy creatures useful in many situa∣tions and probably well worth breed∣ing by those that understand themI very well remember some years ago in an excursion through the low side of Yorkshire seeing a fine Spanish Ass at Beverly fourteen hands three inches high kept as a stallion and covered at no less than two guineas a mare  Of Asses  ASSES tho' I know little of them yet their illtreatment has often excited my compassion These poor creatures are abused and buffeted on all occasions put to the greatest drudgery and hard∣ships and seem to be equally despised  by man and beast It is amazing how patiently they bear with the cruelest treatment and drag out a long life though under unmerciful loads and most barbarous usage  Of Goats  AS to goats though I live in the neighbourhood of Wooler  Wooler is a small markettown pleasantly situ∣ated at the foot of that fine range of mountains called Cheviot Hills in the north part of Northum∣berland miles from Berwick and is a thorough∣fare from London to Edinburgh  which is famous for goatwheydrinking in the season and in which vicinity I suppose more are bred and kept than in any other part of England yet I confess myself very ignorant of their history I am told that some of the sheepbreeders who occupy mountain farms make a handsome profit by keeping goats and sending the whey  down to Wooler in the season when several genteel people from both sides the Tweed as far as Newcastle one way and Edinburgh the other resort thither in the months of May June and July not only for the benefit of drinking the goatwhey but the fine air and angling in the pure limpid streams that come pouring down from the mountains into a very fertile plain below Kid is reckoned a very deli∣cate kind of meat  An acquaintance informs me that he has it from very good authority that the Angora goat which is a distinct species that carries a thick coat of fine silky hair greatly esteemed for certain pur∣poses in some manufactures thrives very well and breeds readily in Sweden they would of course prosper equally well in Britain If they are equally hardy and yield as much milk as the common goat it is probable they would yield much greater profits to the farmer on account of the superior value of their fleece    Of Deer  I also know very little concerning deerBut I suppose that the different species of these animals might be great∣ly improved by the simple and plain rule of selecting the best males and best females and breeding from these in preference to the promiscuous me∣thods which at present I am told are too much pursued And I can have little doubt but that the best venison as well as the best mutton c will always be found in the truest form and along with the smallest and finest bone and if so how easy would it be for a Nobleman or Gentleman to order his gamekeeper to choose out a few of the best males and females prior to the rutting season put them into a fenced place by themselves give the young ones a particular mark to know them from the promiscuous race and  a few years will determine whether this matter be worthy of the attention recommended I know great stress is laid upon the pasturage or herbage they feed upon nor will I deny its effects in a degree yet I apprehend a right choice of the most valuable males and females of any kind whatsoever properly attended to bred from and the produce depastured along with the promiscuous breed will shew a much more conspicuous effect  Poultry  OF the feathered tribe I acknow∣ledge myself more ignorant than even of the quadrupeds I have been last treating However if I am rightly informed by people of nice palates the smallboned wellproportioned poultry greatly excel the largeboned big kind in taste fineness of flesh and flavour and if this be the case it  would seem as though the same prin∣ciple which we have all along endea∣voured to establish held good through all the different classes of domestic animals which supply us with animal food  viz  That all animals of what∣ever kind those which have the small∣est cleanest finest bones are in gene∣ral the best proportioned and covered with the best and finestgrained meat I believe they are also the hardiest healthiest and most inclinable to feed able to bear the most fatigue while living and worth the most  per lib  when dead  ADDENDUM  What follows should have been inserted under the article Cattle but was then overlooked  I APPREHEND one great mistake that breeders in general have run in∣to especially in breeding neat cattle has been in endeavouring to unite greatmilkers with quickfeeders I am inclined to think this cannot be done for wherever we attempt both we are sure to get neither in any per∣fection In proportion as we gain the one in the same proportion we lose the other the more milk the less beef and the more we pursue beef the less milk we get In truth they seem to me to be as it were two different species or sorts of cattle of the same kind for very different uses and if so they ought most certainly to be  differently pursued by those that em∣ploy them If the dairyman wants milk let him pursue the milkingtribe let him have both bull and cows of the best and greatest milkingfamily he can find On the contrary he that wants feeding or grazing cattle let him procure a bull and cows of that sort which feed the quickest wherever they are to be found By pursuing too many ob∣jects at once we are apt to lose sight of the principal and by aiming at too much we often lose all Let us only keep to distinct sorts and we will obtain the prize in due time I apprehend it has been much owing to the mixing of breeds and improper crossings that has kept us so long from distinguishing the most valuable kindsAnd if it had not been for Mr Bakewell perhaps we might still have been groping in the dark at  least that great breeder was the first I know of who pointed out the valu∣able sorts made those true distinctions unobserved I believe before this day and has pursued them with a zeal judgment and perseverance peculiar to himself  I do not suppose this doctrine to be so new as it has been unattended to and not properly considered for I have heard many a man say  How should that cow be a good milker she runs too much to flesh  and so it is while all the great milkers are invariably thin The former are ge∣nerally highsided light bellied co∣vered in all their points and in short in proportion as they recede from the great milkingtribe  fat com∣pared  though kept on middling fare while the latter will be lean upon their backs flatsided lowbellied poor and illlooking though much better kept than the others  I own there is a middling kind of cows which give a tolerable quantity of milk and also keep in pretty good condition or order but this I appre∣hend does not all militate against the above reasoning because still those that incline the most to flesh invari∣ably give the least milk and  vice versa  And tho' many of the middling cows will make very fat when they are dried or the milk taken from them yet not near so quickly fat nor so ripe as those which give less milk and are inclined more to fat while in a milking state  APPENDIX  No I  AN Account of the Names of Domestic Animals at different ages  THE general name by which the male sheep are known is Ram or Tupe When lambs they are called ram or tupelambs as long as they suck From weaning or taking from the ewes to the shearing or clipping for the first time they are called hogs hogerels or lambhogs Then they take the name of shearing shearling shearhog or dinmond tupes or rams After that according to the years they are clipped or shorn they are called twoshear threeshear and so on which always takes place from the time of  shearing  The age of sheep is also known or pretended to be known by the changes on their foreteeth I say pretended because I take upon me to say that it is a very uncertain way of judging as I will endeavour to show afterwards  But when gelt or ca∣strated they are called wedderlambs while sucking then wedderhogs until shorn or clipped when they take the name of shearings c until they are shorn a second time when they are called young wedders or twoshearwedders then three or fourshearwedders or more according to the times they are clipped or shorn  The general name by which the fe∣male sheep are known is Ewe while sucking they are called ewelambs or gimmerlambs but when weaned or taken from the dams they are called ewehogs or gimmerhogs until clip∣ped or shorn for the first time when they take the name of gimmers which  name continues only one year until they lose their fleeces a second time when they obtain the name of ewes which they retain as long as they live only every time they are shorn they add a year to their age and are called twoshear threeshear or fourshearewes according to the times they have been clipped or shorn And this holds good of all other sheep for the age of sheep is not reckoned from the time they are lambed but from the time of shearing for altho' a sheep is generally or months old when first shorn yet they are not called shearings until once clipped which is understood to be the same as one year old  What we call gimmers in the North in many of the midland parts of Eng∣land are called thieves and when twice shorn double thieves This seems very uncouth and inconsistent to our  ears but so much for custom There are other variations of names in dif∣ferent parts which I do not recol∣lect In some places they call the malelambs heeders and the females sheeders and in others twoyearold ewes are called twinters and threeyearolds thrunters  THE general name of the male in Neat Cattle is Bull During the time he sucks he is called a bullcalf until turned of a year old when he is called a stirk or yearling bull then a two three or fouryearold bull until six when he is agedbut when ca∣strated or gelt he is called an ox or stotcalf until a year old when he is called a stirk stot or yearling then a twoyearold steer and in some places a twinterat three he is called a threeyearold steer and at four he first takes the name of ox or bullock  though formerly I believe the ca∣strated male was not called an ox or bullock until six years old  I apprehend the taking the name of ox or bul∣lock at four instead of six years old has taken place since the drawing or working of oxen has been so much difused  when he is looked upon to be at the best tho' some people think an ox improves until seven eight or even nine years old  The general name of the female of this kind is Cow while sucking the dam she is called a cowcalf queycalf or heifercalf then yearling quey or heifer then a twoyearold quey or heifer or twinter the next year a threeyearold quey or heifer and when four she is first called a cow which name is retained till the last If castrated or spayed she is called a spayed or cut heifer or spayed or cut quey in the North parts of the island  A Stonehorse or Stallion is what we distinguish the male of the horsekind by while sucking he is a foal or coltfoal then a yearling colt  In some places a colt from one to two years old is called a stag  afterwards a two and threeyearold colt until four when they are most common∣ly called horses which name holds through  The female of this breed is called a Mare when sucking a mare or filleyfoal then a yearlingfilley after∣wards a two and threeyearold filley and at four she becomes a mare  OF the Pigtribe the male is called a Boar or Brawn the female a Sow the castrated male a hogpig the cut or castrated female a gilt or gautPigs or Swine are common names for the whole tribe  APPENDIX No II  Of the time the different Domestic Ani∣mals shed their teeth and the rules for knowing their age  NEAT Cattle cast no teeth until turned two years old when they get two new teeth at three they get two more and in every succeeding year get two until five years old when they are called fullmouthed though they are not properly fullmouthed until six years old because the two cornerteeth which are the last in renewing are not perfectly up until they are sixIt may also be worthy of notice that the first wrinkle upon the horn does not take place un∣til three years old after which they get another circle or wrinkle every year as long as the horn stands on though not always equally discern∣able  in all horned cattle and I am sorry to say that it is too common for jobbers and cowdealers to scrape rasp or file down these wrinkles in old cattle to prevent the age being known and by that means to deceive and impose upon the unwary igno∣rant and unsuspecting  A horse does not cast or renew any of his teeth until between two and ahalf and three years old when he casts two above and two below  Neat cattle and sheep have no teeth in the upper jaw before but only in the under jaw while the horse tribe has both above and below indeed the former chew the cud but the latter does not  Between three and ahalf and four years he casts four more  viz  two above and two below and between four and ahalf and five years old he casts the remaining four which are called the cornerteeth It is remarkable that  the eight first teeth which the horse renews make all their growth in abour days while the four last or cornerteeth take about a year and ahalf to make their full growth The four first teeth he renews are called  nippers  or  gatherers  the next four are called  separaters  and the four last are the cornerteeth which also contain the black mark by which the dealers can so well dislinguish the age of a horse And some may think that I ought to say something of this matter here but those that want to be acquainted with this doctrine need only consult Bart∣let Brecken or any of our books upon farriery where they will find it fully explainedHorses have also four tusks or tushes as the dealers call them which stand between the foreteeth and grinders and usually make their appearance when a horse is about three and ahalf years old but are not  at their full growth until the horse be six years old  The above is taken from the Compleat Horse∣man or Perfect Farrier    Sheep in general renew their first two teeth from to months old and afterwards every year about the same time until they are turned three years old or rather three shear to speak technically when they become fullmouthed for though they have eight teeth in the underjaw before I believe they only cast or renew the six inside ones However this matter is not perfectly clear because I find the shepherds differ in opinion some thinking they cast only six others again all the eight foreteeth  Observations on the above  IT may be observed that Sheep re∣new their first teeth soon after they are past one year old Neat Cattle not until they are past two and Horses not until they are near three years old And this is perfectly consistent with the wisdom of the Great Greator in all his worksbecause the horsetribe live the longest and are evidently meant to bear the greatest hardships The bulltribe the next longest and tho' very useful as a beast of draught yet not at all equal to the horse in firmness and hardiness And the in∣nocent sheep live the shortest time and increase the fastest not being in∣tended as a beast of burden or draught but to feed and clothe the lords of the creationI have heard of particular sheep living to near years oldthose which the mountainshepherds  call guidesheep  viz  old wedders kept on purpose to guide and direct the bleeting flocks upon those unfrequent∣ed wildsI have also heard of parti∣cular bulls living more than years and I knew a horse live until years This horse had a ball lodged in his neck at the battle of Proud Preston in the Rebellion of the year and the ball was extracted when the horse died in This horse was sup∣posed to be four years old in the year consequently would be in the year  Now respecting the judging of the age of the above animals by the re∣newing of their teeththo' perhaps the best rule we know of yet I cannot think it is always to be depended on However in sheep I am very certain we are liable to be misled by it and I apprehend much depends upon being carly or late lambed well or ill fed  and so on Particularly tupes I have frequently known to have what we call four broad or renewed teeth when by the above rule they ought to have had only twoA friend of mine and an eminent breeder Mr Charge of Cleasby a few years ago shewed a shearing tupe at Richmond in York∣shire for the premium given by the Agriculture Society there which had six broad teeth in consequence of which the judges rejected Mr Charge's tupe tho' confessedly the best sheep because they believed him to be more than a shearing However Mr Charge afterwards proved to the satisfaction of the Gentlemen that his tupe was no more than a shearing  FINIS  ERRATA  P    L    For  on the subject of rearing crops
