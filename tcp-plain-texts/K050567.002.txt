PERFECTLY HAPPY IN SHENSTONEGREEN  IN process of a little time the inhabitants of  ShenstoneGreen  began to be weary of looking on the same objects They had examined the woods the walks the fields and the flowers till all these became tiresome The praise of their patron Sir Benjamin indeed was still echoed from lip to lip but somewhat more faintly than at first At length they found  so few charms in vegetable nature and still life that they cast about for new sources of entertainment The first symptom of inquietude which I perceived was by means of the following letter that was put into my hands by the steward to whom it was directed at the lodge  To Mr  SAMUEL SARCASM  at  STEWARD'SLODGE  on  SHENSTONEGREEN  Mr  SAMUEL SARCASM  WE the four underwritten gentlemen beg of you to represent the following sentiments to our worthy patron namely to tell him that we have all our lives been remarkably fond of the sports of the field and the glories of the  chace and although we were once  beat hollow  yet by a new management are sure of our  sides  for the time to come What we would therefore propose is to introduce a little snug stud of runninghorses rather for the occasional amusement of the company than for any more lucrative view We find upon examination that the turf of  ShenstoneGreen  is remarkably fine for the horses feet and upon measuring the whole circle within the houses it appears that it would make a mighty pretty mile and a half heat With leave then of our patron against whose consent we would by no means set up even this most manly exercise we propose  fixing up a startingpost a booth c upon the  Green  and to have our monthly matches This will be attended Mr Sarcasm with no charge to Sir Benjamin unless he chooses to encourage the institution so far as to give his purse of twenty guineas more or less to be run for by four year olds which might be a bountymoney in the capacity of patron of the course With regard to horses we flatter ourselves that few men in Europe have bred better blooded things and if we have been usually  distanced  it hath always been on account of bad jockeyship and not for wanting skill in horseflesh We do not doubt bringing as fine a show of  cattle in a few weeks as ever were seen and as to the times of running c we will consider about that Meantime are  "MR SAMUEL SARCASM'S "Humble servants  Alexander Spur  "Simon Slapdash  "Christopher Cutcord  "William Whipwell  This proposal was instantly laid before Mr Seabrooke who set up a long whistle and said he had a great mind to laugh at human nature  For my part sir said the steward I think one has more reason to cry at human nature than to laugh for  I never yet found her four and twenty hours in the same mind in my life  But what is to be done my dear Seabrooke said Iwhat is to be done  Whew  cried this singular man catching up his hat and stick and walking off  Whew  Lord papa said Matilda I cannot see any harm in the gentlemen's amusing themselves with a few horses besides which it will be so charming to have  ShenstoneGreen Races  It will be such an amusement for all the ladies and gentlemen who may see the whole course from beginning to end Then it will bring such a  world of good company Who will not go to  ShenstoneGreen Races  Oh heavens I like the idea of all things Pray papa say  yes  Let us have a race by all manner of means  Well well my dear said I go and join Mr Seabrooke who I perceive is whistling away in the court and I shall consider of it When I had the steward alone I shut the door and seizing him by the hand spoke thus My old friend I do not well know why but I tremble upon this subject These four gentlemen are I fear going to introduce upon us a dangerous entertainmentPray what are their particular circumstances that is how are they situated  On my private pensionerslist sir they cut rather a queer figure of four Let me seeI have the catalogue about me I thinkAye here they are They come under the letter Jjockiesjockies where are youOh here we have them  SPUR  Alexander  Beat out of Newmarket eight timesa goodnatured man very honest but a lover of the sport  SLAPDASH  Simon  A good son and a tender husband while horses are kept out of his sight would merit the pension if he were not to meet on the  Green  any gentlemen sportsmen  CUTCORD  Christopher  Thought to be as  knowing a one  as ever was  taken in  In other respects a harmless gentleman Is said to be the best shot also in England Made a point of shoeing his own horses and always rode himself  WHIPWELL  William  Is so broken to the bit that when he had ruined himself and literally RUN himself into jail he had the bridle and saddle of his bay colt Zephyr imprisoned to keep him company Otherwise just generous and even moral  Oh Samuel Samuel said I at the bottom of this account what is to be done  It does not admit of a question sirI wish it did  What do you mean Samuel  I mean sir that if you think proper to set beggars on  borseback  they will ride to the Devil I know an't please your Honour both man and beast  But the peril of this project Samuel  We have only to guard against the effects sir You had better submit with a good grace to what you have no  power to prevent  But one might expostulate Samuel in a tender manner obliquely delicately like a friend  What sir expostulate with four young fellows whose blood is now galloping through every vein of their bodies and newly put into possession of two hundred pounds ayear for lifesir it would be  atrocious  I would not  wish  any coercive power to remain with me but surely Samuel if I were to submit my apprehension of consequences to their judgements  The judgement of a set of jockies siryour honour makes me smile  Well then Samuel you shall carry them my answer tomorrow  It is enough answered Samuel  CHAP XXVI CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF SHENSTONEGREEN RACES  SHENSTONEGREEN RACES said I when I found myself aloneit has an ugly sound I could have wished thatbutno matter One must expect men will have some amusements and indeed on second thoughts if they had  not  how could they  dispose  of their annuity or of what service would it be to them  These reflexions determined me to send my reply without delay Subjoined reader you have a correct copy  To Messieurs  SPUR SLAPDASH CUTCORD  and  WHIPWELL  Esquires  GENTLEMEN  IF I hesitated a single moment to answer the letter with which you have honoured me it was upon the most delicate and disinterested principle At the time I invited you to favour me with your company at  ShenstoneGreen  it was be assured with no wish to enslave but to increase your liberty and to insure to you that independence which is so suitable to man's spirit Every thing therefore which increases  your  happiness cannot but increase  mine  because I am persuaded that all your joys will correspond correctly with the simplicity  and innocence of  ShenstoneGreen  Thus although the common consequences of runninghorses are not quite eligible yet I trust you will contrive to render them a pleasing relaxation to yourselves and to others In this light it is solely that I see your proposal To object to it therefore had I the power which I have  not  would be exercising too scrupulous a caution There are few pastimes fatal but when they are excessiveyours will I trust be agreeable to the law of moderation I have the honour to be  GENTLEMEN Your most obliged And obedient servant B BEAUCHAMP  Mansionhouse  Just as I was sealing this letter Matilda and Mr Seabrooke returned and the former was made happy for the night on hearing there would speedily be races on  ShenstoneGreen  CHAP XXVII SHENSTONEGREEN RACES CONTINUED  A FEW days after this permission was given I happened to be crossing  The Green  where I perceived these four worthy gentlemen of the whip in close consultation the subject of which was whether the startingpost should be fixed on the east or the west side or whether the ladies booth or gentlemen's should be first erected One said as the houses were in a circle that commanded the course booths of any sort were unnecessary  I can see from my diningroom window every inch of ground said Mr Spur  I will hold you five to four of that answered Mr Cutcord  And I will go your halves said Mr Whipwell  Double it and say done cried Mr Slapdash  I left them to settle this interesting dispute and walked on  Ah SHENSTONE said I softly this is but a bad beginning The figure of my friend being full in the centre I went up to it and was almost petrified to see the very Founder of the feast plaistered all over with printed advertisements On examining these more narrowly I found a formal annunciation of matters intended by the jockeyparty who had stuck and  billed my beloved  Shenstone  from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot One of the advertisements ran thus SHENSTONEGREEN RACES  MONDAY May the st the Patron's plate of twenty guineas will be run for by six year olds They took this purse for granted  A sweepstakes of a hundred guineas  A private match for fifty pounds  And several other bystrokes  The horses intended to start on the first day are Mr Spur's  Shenstone  Mr Cutcord's chesnut gelding  Annuity  got by Orpheus who came  out of Eurydice who was got by Pyrrhus  Mr Slapdash's bay filly  Rentfree  who came of  Goodnature  who was from that famous horse  Liberal  Mr Whipwell's grey colt  Beauchamp  I went home very much mortified at having seen the sacred marble of my friend polluted and was just going to express my displeasure when a servant brought me a card and said it waited an answer I both read and replied to it almo  in the same instant  CARD  Messrs Spur Whipwell Cutcord and Slapdash present their affectionate  compliments to their best friend Sir Benjamin Beauchampinform him they have great reason to hope he will approve the measures they have taken with regard to the approaching races as they have testified their respect to Sir Benjamin even in the names of the horses one having the honour to be called  Shenstone  the second  Annuity  the third  Rentfree  and the fourth  Beauchamp  They will continue to show every instance of their heartfelt gratitude on the most trifling occasions as well as on the present which is important  ANSWER  Sir Benjamin Beauchamp is ever flattered by the kind attentions of the  gentlemen who have now so particularly  distinguished  him but begs it as a favour that the figure of Mr  Shenstone  in the centre of the Village may be considered as the image of a friend whose generous ideas were the  hasis of the Green  and whose very statue therefore Sir Benjamin cannot bear to see disguised or disfigured  In an hour after this was sent off I understood by Mr Seabrooke that ample justice had been done by the jockies to Shenstone's statue which was not only cleared of its incumbrances but washed and rubbed into the bargain  I walked out to see the alteration and felt my heart so elated that I told Mr Seabrooke I could not but  consider this sudden reverence to our poetical friend's pedestal as a good symptom It is  respectful  Mr Seabrooke said I  I like it said Mr Seabrooke I like it  CHAP XXVIII MR HENRY HEWIT HAS A BAD PEN AND A FINE HEART  BUT the adoption of errour is easy and imperceptible and the races were not run before poor  Sarcasm  who was obliged to wade through all the slavery of his office came charged with other petitions  A little matter from half a dozen of your honest  tradesmen  sir said Samuel as he came into the room where were seated Mr Seabrooke and Matilda  Let us see Samuel Pray is it good or bad news  It is human infirmity sir  Then I must pity it said Seabrooke and whistle  Ihheartily pity it too said Matilda  The paper being laid open presented to me the subsequent composition of which I shall not even alter the orthography  To  HIS HONORABLE WURTHYNUSS  Sir  B BEECHUMPE A BARROW KNIGHT  Your honorable wurthyness is desired to hear six of your loyal tradesmen Who finds that you haven been so honorible as to instatutes rases a thing which all the wurld must like who purtends to taust On which accounte we who signe this want to make it a  finished affair Seeing that rases are going for to be run we beg your honorableness will give us leaf to fite cocks an amussmunt we have long likked We would make our cockpit on the Green and know where we can have  gingers redbreasts  and  yellowleggs  which will fite till they die Not a runner in any of the whole penns  I had not time to read the names of the people concerned in this letter before Matilda cried out Gracious god is it possible and just as she had uttered that exclamation in came a man in a violent hurry whom the reader will recollect as a pensioner under the name of Henry Hewit  Sir sir Sir Benjamin said Henry quite out of breath I have  heard of another plot against your honour but it won't take I'll be your friend yet I am Henry Hewit  What's the matter Henry  The cocks sir and the cockfighters If you let such a bloody piece of business as that come upon your Green you may look for murder and all manner of sins after Here I am sir that never killed a creature to my knowledge in the way of sport in my life And if I do but catch a spider which I hate more than any thing else I break his web to pieces only to save him from doing his mischief for his web sir is his net and there it is he hampers his prey No sir don't pray don't  let cockfighters come amongst us Tell the folks they may have cricket or fives If a child of mine was to love cockfightingIII don't know what I should do to himIII verily think I should not bear the sight of him again for  ten minutes  Let me beg of you sir to consider of it  Whewsaid Mr Seabrooke rising up out of his chair the world which the boy Alexander won ought to be given to that man He would make it happy  Mr Henry said Matilda you are always giving me a pain in the head I think I protest I have such a stroke here that I must take the air a little  Better the head ache than the heart ache Miss Matilda and God knows you'd think of me if you were to see the poor dears go to mangle and murder themselves for nothing  Insufferableinsufferable the fellow's insufferable said Mr Seabrooke I must follow Matilda  When the wind is in this corner I have always weak eyes cried Samuel Sarcasm blowing his nose  Then don't go to the cockfighting Master Sarcasm rejoined Hewit for that will make 'em worse I promise thee  Whewcried Seabrooke running out of the room  Well sir added Henry what may I say  Alas honest Hewit said I at the time of providing a town I did not provide against the follies nor the vices of its inhabitants whom indeed I took care to have such as were least subject in my opinion to either vice or folly  Then sir I am sorry for it and will take care to be out of the way when the fighting bouts come on Your Honour's humble servant  He went away  But you have yet some authority over your tradesmen sir said the good steward and I think might take upon you to forbid a thing of this nature Suppose we go down together to the tradesmen'scorner and argue the point personally Cockfighting  sir is really atrocious the idea hath made me sick  Pleased with the proposal we set off for Tradesmen'scorner where a croud was just at that instant collected to see a pitched battle between a ShenstoneGreen butcher and a ShenstoneGreen baker The blows that rebounded on their naked bodies were heard at a considerable distance and the cries of  strike him strike him  at him  Tom  at him  Dick  echoed from men women and children who all seemed to be highly delighted with the entertainment  Sarcasm prudently stopped short and asked me if I did not think we might find a less bloody opportunity for an humane business  O Samuel said I it in is vain to forbid those to fight cocks who have a passion for slaughtering one another  The sooner we go home to bed sir the better said Samuel Let us shut our eyes for a few hours  against the species  CHAP XXIX A VERY BLOODY CHAPTER AND A VERY HARD CRUST FOR THE PROPRIETOR OF SHENSTONEGREEN  IN due time reader the races were run and the cocks were fought Would to heaven the worst misfortune attending these amusements had been the disfiguration of the beautiful grassplats of  ShenstoneGreen  and throwing idly into the air a large sum of money This however was but a part For the days of the race and of the cockfight were distinguished by many other more memorable circumstances The bills of both the diversions being assiduously distributed we had an inundation of  strangers pouring in from all quarters under pretence of seeing  ShenstoneSports  Amongst others came padding into our territory some of those shameless women who always attend every dissipated exhibition and I absolutely heard a hawker crying out while he was running through the ranks between the heats  A List of the Sporting Ladies Gentlemen A true List of the Sporting Ladies on  ShenstoneGreen  Turning with rapid indignation from this unforeseen misfortune I went to another part of the race ground and came full in the face of an outrage still more fatal Exalted above the heads of the people were a mountebank and his men exerting all the ruinous chicane of their itineracy  The chief of these vagabonds harangued the multitude on the inestimable virtues of his universal nostrum and I could see plainly his eloquence was but too palatable Many bottles of a precious drop and many boxes of an invaluable powder were bought of these empericks  then  which are lying in the bones of the silly purchasers at this moment  Seabrooke set up a whistle on seeing the quacks and jumping up on the scaffold offered to buy their whole stock in trade  That will be impossible sir replied one of the fellows for any man in this or in a much richer nation to compass For I have phials that  scarce hold a thimble full of liquid which are worth a world eachBuy our stock in trade indeed  Could I have bought them said Mr Seabrooke to me in a whisper I would certainly have chucked the whole purchase into one of the basons of water and by poisoning all your fish Benjamin convince the people what they were at After which the vender might have been led out of  The Green  victoriously by the nose As it is my friend added he you must not be surprized that the serpents creep out in the sunshine of  ShenstoneGreen  It is a fine basking place for them tocast their skins  Bending my course forward I came at last to the cockpit where  two animals were at that moment engaged in all the ardour of natural animosity I had scarce time to reflect how it was possible for rational beings to find any pleasure in bringing creatures together to kill or be killed when the exclamations of  six to two on the Sable  and  forty to four on the Ginger  drove me from the scene of horrour But the violence of the shout still pursued me and I heard distinctly that Ginger was struck through the brain and Sable came off conqueror with only the loss of an eye  But by this time the grand running match which was to finish the evening came on I looked round the circle of houses and beheld  every window stuck full with caps and curiosity Dogs men women and children were driven from the course and all was clear within the ropes  ShenstoneGreen  breathed expectation Every heart panted every eye was open In about a quarter of an hour four horses were led along  The Green  by four boys who were followed by four men These were Messieurs Spur Slapdash Cutcord and Whipwell but he who had seen these gentlemen a fortnight before must have looked very steadily to recognize them Besides that they were totally altered in point of dress they were totally altered likewise in point of  bodily dimensions  Perhaps there never was naturally four human beings whose size so  little resembled each other and yet they appeared now brought to the same standard yea to the delicacy of half a dram weight The truth is Mr Slapdash and Mr Spur who were both brawny had been some time  reducing themselves  to match Messieurs Cutcord and Whipwell who were happily as much like skeletons and scarecrows as they  ought  to be But how such a corporeal reduction could have been performed upon the carcase of Slapdash is to this moment a mystery Surely reader it will be such to thee when thou art told that Mr Slapdash was one of those squabby men whose necks are of the same breadth with the shoulders His cheeks were inflated with solid fat  and his belly held forth that bursting plenitude which is so remarkably apt to collect in a British subject But Mr Slapdash had it seems made his very  person  the object of a  wager  and there were very consisiderable betts depending on his success or miscarriage In a point of such importance Mr Slapdash willing to increase his fame by diminishing his flesh shut himself up in a dark room on the fifteenth of April and sweated himself near dissolution None but the persons who had laid on  his  side of the question were permitted to see him and some of these fearing his flesh would too obstinately cling to his bones played upon him several little tricks that might tend to his diminution At one time  they contrived just when the sweating draught was operating to introduce into his room a large cat shod with walnutshells at another one of the wags assumed the shape of a spectre in a white sheet and clanged a chain in the dead of night at his bed side At other times they envelloped him head over heels in so many blankets that he could scarce breathe under them By such kind of sudorifics he had the good luck at last to melt down all that superfluous health and force which stood betwixt him and glory and to the dismay of those who had betted on the continuity of his corpulence he came out of his flannels on the first of May as meagre and as miserable a looking mortal as ever disgraced  that noble animal which he was to bestride  As you my good reader did not see the exact copy of the last bill which described the several dresses of the gentlemenjockies I shall just acquaint you that Mr Cutcord's jacket was blue Mr Whipwell's yellow and white Mr Spur's crimson and Mr Slapdashes morone They walked their steeds to the startingpost they were separately weighed in the scales and set off What a thrilling moment  I looked with all my might for the pleasure which is said to lie  full in the view  when four men on horseback are resolved to outstrip one another in speed as much and as far as  possible I am almost afraid lest I should ruin the credit of my book with all jockies should I confess which were I not persuaded those gentlemen never read I should  not  venture that I could not work myself up to one poor sensation of satisfaction The whole appeared to me so perfectly a matter of the same consequence that I did not care one farthing about it To be the  first  I could not think any honour and to be last I could not imagine any shame I asked Mr Seabrooke's opinion of this Have  you  any warm feelings my good friend  Whewanswered Mr Seabrooke wheeling away to another part of the groundFeelingsWhew  Not so the spectators No sooner did the jockies come to the pushingplace than the confusion of the chace began and as the horses approached that part of the course where the grand trials were to be made where the whip was to be cut into the flank and the spur dug into the side the loudest acclamations of passion and of pleasure reechoed to the shore What that could agonize  my  heart did I not hear fifty guineas to five cried one on the Crimson An hundred to a China orange on the blue Morone against the field said a third Shillings against guineas to any amount that yellow is distanced hollowed a fourth My  pension  against  yours  sir cried two others  who were clattering their sticks and clapping their hands what say you My  pension  to  yours  Say done if you dare  Done  sir  done  answered the other  In the midst of this uproar came up to me in a violent hurry Mr Edward Elixir who was so pleased and so vexed that he had alternately laughed and cried during the whole course but there is no staying long in one place today sir said he and away he bounded from side to side as rapid as a roebuck  Mr Seabrooke busied himself in driving off a parcel of brats who had taken possession of  Shenstone'sstatue  from the top of whose pedestal they had it seems a full view of the sport I incontinently begged  pardon  sir said Seabrooke of the figure and talked to it on the ungentle doings of the day as if it had life  But the honours of the course were much divided and much obstructed In turning a difficult corner  Beauchamp  ran butt against  Shenstone  and had wellnigh foundered the former after that  Beauchamp  having  too much rein  ran on the wrong side the post and stumbled on the fetlocks of  Annuity  which  Rentfree  perceiving whipped up and was scouring away on the stretch of victory which he would certainly  have gained had not  Annuity  that moment got upon his legs passed  Rentfree  like lightning and carried off the prize  Shenstone  was brought in dead lame and  Beauchamp  was beat hollow  CHAP XXX THE PROPRIETOR EXERTS HIMSELF AND IS SO MUCH INSULTED THAT HE PUTS AN END TO THE CHAPTER ABRUPTLY  I RETIRED from the course in some confusion and secretly resolved to attempt some preventative against the further increase of these disorders In the mean time the night was passed by the  Shenstonians  in riot and revelry in the fury of planning new follies and in the triumph of relating the past Upon surveying the scene the next morning it is difficult to describe the appearance of a change so perfect The soft carpet of verdure that before  covered the plain was torn into raggedness by the trampling of beasts and the bustlings of men The tender vegetable fences which before separated one man's portion from that of a neighbour were gapped and broken The flowers lay scattered about their beds in fragments and the whole scene was  disemparadised  As I cast my eye forlornly over the prospect it brought to my mind these verses of Milton  Thus began  Outrage from lifeless things but Discord first  Daughter of Sin amongst th' irrational  Death  introduc'd through fierce  Antipathy  BEAST now with BEAST gan war and FOWL  WITH FOWL  But my anger increased as I continued to view the ravages and in  order to check such violent amusements for the time to come I immediate issued forth the following edict  WHEREAS it was no part of the author's intention in building  ShenstoneGreen  and cultivating the land about it to destroy its beauty in the very first summer by the introduction of  cruel entertainments  I do hereby intreat that for the future all such entertainments if they are carried on at all be out of the precincts of the said  ShenstoneGreen  which is already so much damaged that it will require time before it can be brought to its former state of rural elegance  BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP  This notice was no sooner gone abroad than it produced very different consequences First came a card written by the parson of my village  CARD I  THE Reverend Mr Cushion presents his most respectful compliments to his worthy patron Sir B Beauchamp and in the name of a very amiable body of the pensioners male as well as female returns him sincere thanks for his active endeavours to banish from  The Green  an amusement so perilous and so unchristian They consider the gardens and the morals equally concerned in this inhibition and hope it will tend to  recreate  order and regularity in the  noblest society that ever was instituted  ParsonagePlace  The pleasure I felt on the receipt of this note was great but it was effaced by the next  CARD II  Your  Proclamation  Sir Benjamin was pleasant it had all the air of majesty about it As to amusements they depend upon taste If we have hurt the flowers we are willing to pay for them amongst us  three  for Mr Whipwell who rode Beauchamp has run from  The Green  However as loyal subjects you may depend on it we shall as in duty bound readily obey any commands  you are graciously pleased to impose on  A SPUR  C CUTCORD  S SLAPDASH  As this was formerly a pretty hard morsel for me to digest so I conceive it may be for the reader I do not see therefore how I can so properly show my respect for him as to end the Chapter at this crisis in which my gentlemen of the whip and short waistcoat figure so muchLIKE THEMSELVES  CHAP XXXI THE SPORTS OF FALSE DELICACY  IT was by setting the politeness of the one against the rudeness of the  other  that I was able to strike the balance without any considerable depression of spirits We must always agree to a compromise between good and evil fortune If said I weighing two circumstances a few unruly and uncultured characters rise up against the very shadow of government there are other minds so much better disposed that pain and pleasure are at least equipoised Nay the latter is in the present case predominant For who will compare five or six cockfighters and jockies who have  returned to their old infirmities to upwards of thirty regular persons whose gratitude is ever warm and whose love of order will continue to increase the felicity of our society Perhaps my last injunctions might after all be carrying my wishes beyond my power I may perhaps have stepped over the decent limits of that sacred law which every man should tremble to violate while he is conferring a benefit The rights of hospitality are so extremely delicate that while distress or poverty is under its protection the greatest caution should be exerted For the future I am determined to be more circumspect  At the conclusion of this soliloquy in came Matilda introducing to me a  female friend and a young pensioner I pretended to receive them as new faces or at least such as I had only transiently seen at the time of their initiation But in reality they were that very Sidney and Eliza whose peculiar passion for each other hath been already delineated  Mr Seabrooke was not at home He was hunting Mayladies in the wood  Amongst many intricate scenes which I have seen pass in the company of four people that which was in this interview acted by our extraordinary lovers was not the least  I who was in the secret soon found out that there was a double plot  to be sustained for Mr Sidney was to pass as a casual acquaintance and Eliza was not to betray the least traits of her affection even to her friend Matilda Let us see how this was performed Nature hath not often assumed a more delicate disguise  In compliment perhaps to me the conversation turnednotwithstanding we were then at the  teatable  upon the pleasures of pure  benevolence  and upon  ShenstoneGreen  It warms the heart in such a manner said Eliza It so anticipates the elysium we are to expect hereafter It brings so much of heaven down upon earthThen it gives such opportunities of bringing old friends together Here she glanced her eye towards Sidney  Madam said Sidneya little disconcertedis there any thing amiss about my person that you are pleased to honour it with so  particular  an attention  No said Eliza rather blushing  Is your tea made to your liking dear Eliza said Matilda  Perfectly replied Eliza willing to turn the conversation by adverting to trifles I lately take a great deal of sugar  Indeed  cried Sidney you are much changed then for I rememberformerly  What do you remember Mr Sidney said Eliza interrupting him for  fear he should finish his blunder What do you remember  I think said  I  willing to give a goodnatured lift we are quite  still  after the hurry of our last week's amusements  Amusements do you call them Sir Benjamin said Eliza If I had any of my family who could encourage or if there was any person whom I  respected  that did not reverence  you  sir for the manner in which you expressed your displeasure on that occasion I should hate him  As I hope to be saved exclaimed Mr Sidney with uncommon earnestness  I  could never bear the idea Eliza You know it  You  Mr Sidneywhat right had I to supposethat  you  Mr Sidney  It was the gentleman's humanity that gave him so much emotion madam said I and I am persuaded he will rather be applauded than censured for the exertion of such a virtue by Miss Elliot  But Mr Sidney's virtues sir are always so much of the violent kind answered the lady  Always  madam said the gentleman  How can Mr Seabrooke possibly be in that filthy wood said Matilda when he might be so much more agreeably engaged  Filthy  wood Miss Beauchamp cried Sidneysilthy wood do you  call itOh my God  Eliza  I believe will not subscribe to the propriety of that epithet Filthy wood  Why should you suppose so Mr Sidney said Eliza I see nothing very remarkable thatthat  Not remarkableOh Miss Elliothow you talkWas it not in that  blessed wood    Blessed wood Mr Sidney  Thatthat the birds andand  Pray Mr Sidney said I do you not think the walks are tolerably laid out and the benches well fixed upon the whole  Admirably sir replied Sidney but we shall know more of it to night for  Mr Sidney said Eliza  Mr Sidney  For  I  intend to walk in itSir Benjamin that's all  What  alone  said Matilda  Unless madam Sir Beauchamp would permit me the honourthe honour  Hemhem coughed Eliza with all her force The honour ofof yourThe poor fellow had got into a mistake of which he could by no means clear himself  No said I touching Matilda gently on the cheek my little friend here seldom goes out of an evening  Mr Seabrooke and I are to play at chess papaanswered Matilda smiling  The eyes of Eliza were lighted up in a moment Sidney seemed as if a load was taken from his heart and in a few minutes after Sidney had  formally  invited Eliza to honour him with her hand home the visitors departed  No sooner were they gone than Matilda observed with great simplicity that Mr Sidney was a mighty pretty man if he had not got such a trick of  stammering  and that as to  Eliza  she said she never saw her in such a peevish temper before  Mr Seabrooke now coming in I pretended some business on  the Green  and left them together  CHAP XXXII THE SAME SUBJECT  I WENT immediately to the wood where after hunting through many mazes and stopping to listen at every five paces I both heard and saw the persons I sought I had an opportunity to conceal myself behind a cluster of elms where I could so shift about as occasion might require that had the sun instead of the moon been shining I might have carried on my little stratagem undiscovered To this manoeuvre it is reader that I am able to give you the following dialogue  SIDNEY  It does not signify talking Miss Elliot you have fairly betrayed it  ELIZA  No sir it is through  your  means that Sir Benjamin and his daughter know the whole matter  SIDNEY  The delicacy of  my  passion Miss Elliot is  ELIZA  Neither prudent nor consistent sir Had your passion been  truly  delicate  SIDNEY  Had  it been Heavens madam am I doubted  ELIZA  Mr Sidney Mr Sidney you have done very ill We shall be the talk or  ShenstoneGreen  Our passion will be as public  SIDNEY  As Eliza has made it Sir Benjamin has a right to laugh at the hobblethe hobble which  ELIZA  You have brought yourself intoIt would have been some consolation indeed had our affection been discovered properly But as you think we have both bungled  SIDNEY  No madam not both  my  heart dictated every word  ELIZA  Sir my tenderness was to the full as  apparent  as yours  SIDNEY  Mine madam betrayed itself in every trifle our patron saw it as plain  ELIZA  Not to see mine sir would argue blindness and want of understanding When I talked of old friends being brought together I looked at you in such a manner that it would be impossible to mistake my meaning  SIDNEY  My  tenderness Miss Elliot was still more conspicuous in the way that I took notice of  yours  ELIZA  But I have better demonstrations sir Think about the affair of the  wood  SIDNEY  In  that  madam I exposed  my  passion infinitely beyond Eliza  ELIZA  Tis false you did not Mr Sidney  SIDNEY  I did Think too of my embarrassment about the birds  ELIZA  Rather remember the delicate confusion of my cough when you imprudently invited Matilda to walk with you  SIDNEY  That completes  my  victory Miss Elliot for in that halfuttered invitation I laid open my tender soul to the whole view of the company  ELIZA  You are a very unjust man and I have a great mind to submit it to Sir Benjamin himself  SIDNEY  Rather madam let us part for ever it is but too clear we shall  never agree You never loved me  ELIZA  Not love you Sidney  SIDNEY  Oh Heavens what is the matter Eliza  ELIZA  NothingMr Sidney  SIDNEY  Your dear eyes are wetOh heavens forgive me forgive me thou best of women  ELIZA  Ah SidneySidney  SIDNEY  This kiss is the seal of our eternal reconciliationcome my best love the dew fallsyou may catch cold let me conduct you home  These two sensitive souls now embraced with the fondest affection and going home lingered a few minutes at the door of the lady and then parted  CHAP XXX HUMAN NATURE SHOWS OFF ON SHENSTONEGREEN  FOR two or three days after my edict about the impropriety of racing and cock  ting the  Shenstonians  were remarkably tranquil and I was just on the brink of felicitating myself hereupon when the steward came to the Mansionhouse with a bundle of papers whose very size threatened an invasion of the peace  What have you got there Samuel said I As much as I can well carry sir replied Samuel laying down his load and adjusting his grey locks  But of what kind Mr Sarcasm  Of poor human nature an't please your honour She is always ailing sir and like a sick man afflicted with a complication one disorder is no sooner cured than twenty more make their appearance  While the steward was making this physical remark he loosened the red tape which was tied round the papers and presented them to me in the following order To begin with trifles sir amuse yourself with N  o    N  o  was directedTo the knight  of the noble soul  Sir Benjamin Beauchamp  MOST BENEVOENT BARON  HEARING that you have erected a whole town at your own expence for the good of the public we the most unhappy part of it do humbly address you from our prisonhouse his majesty's Fleet where we are at this time confined from the wholesome air for honest debts The persons who are chiefly concerned in this epistle are not the poor devils on the  common side  who are huddled together for paltry demands and are reduced to live on the king's generous allowance of bread and water but  gentlemen  sir gentlemen who have formerly cut their figure in the fashionable circle kept it up for several  year together and made the stones both of London and Paris fly before them Not a single man of us but was nabbed for a debt of distinction five or six hundred pounds the smallest But we find our time hang so very dragging sir that we have resolved to address your noble soul in our behalf Your scheme being to relieve the embarrassed where will you find men more embarrassed than such as are deprived of their liberty who had exhausted all credit before they were arrested and who consequently can live in jail only upon the catch Your benevolent buildings therefore upon Mr  Shenstone's  basisby the by that  Shenstone  is much obliged to you for bringing him into vogue for none of  us  who sign this letter ever  heard his name beforeare the only asylums which can be of any comfort in our situation because as we observed above we had better remain in the Fleet than be let out without any future provision and your plan appears to be the only one adopted in the present age where a gentleman somewhat faded can polish himself up again Though our debts amount collectively to about ninety thousand pounds yet we are well convinced our creditors have such an idea of us that they will chearfully take sixpence or a shilling in the pound So that for a mere trifle you may make the compromise We wait for your reply on the  wrong side  of brick walls and iron bars so no more need be hinted to your  known humanity But as a further argument in our favour we cannot in justice to ourselves omit showing you by some proofs that we did not come here for any petty piddling ungenteel claims Annexed therefore you will receive a short sketch of our respective actions none of which we flatter ourselves can ever entail disgrace upon men of family spirit and  Your most obedient Humble servants  The names of my most obedient humble servants were inclosed in the following  LIST  SPLITCLOTH  against  FREDERICK FLASH  Esq  FOR cloth furnished and clothes made as by bill delivered £ s ½d  N B This debt was not more than seven months standing and F Flash was esteemed the best dressed man in England all that time Splitcloth has declared he will take the odd  s  and  d½  and F Flash to pay original cost of writ and prison fees  PERSIAN  against  GAYMAN  FOR one thousand pounds worth of mercery sent by said Gayman's order to the lodgings of Miss Snoozle N  o  Bondstreet  N B Snoozle set the fashions for three parts of the summer The vogue was nothing but Snoozlecaps Snoozlehats Snoozlehoods and Snoozlesacks it was even a fashion to say such or such a thing that had any pretensions to air was à la Snoozle The last time Mr Gayman saw this lady was just when Persian's writ was served upon the said Gayman at  her  apartment  POLICY  against  HAZARD  Mr Hazard though originally  in  at the suit of Policy a broker hath twentyeight detainers amounting in the whole to a sum not exceeding thirty thousand pounds and if Sir B B does not stand his friend must lie for life Mr Hazard's case is particularly hard He was the man who some years ago rendered himself famous by insuring tickets in the lottery and bought up as many wholes as would have made him the richest commoner in England had his purchases consisted of prizes instead of blanks Mr Hazard is still more to be pitied in consideration that he in conjunction with some others ruined himself by playing at  pushpin one rainy evening when they nor he had any other intention than to pass the time betwixt tea and supper But men of real spirit can never answer for themselves when set in for it  As I saw the list was made out wholly on the same principle I did not think it necessary to go on but with great marks of amazement in my countenance asked the steward if he supposed this letter was sent in the way of waggery or seriousness  Bless me answered Samuel your honour seems to know but little of things terrestrial This is to me atrocious Are you to be told sir that the passions can make us believe any thing and while the miser is  priding himself upon the propriety of putting a thousand pounds into his chest the prodigal thinks he is doing as meritorious an action in throwing double that sum away You and I sir who are neither miser nor prodigal can say this is  wrong  but if we were engaged in the schemes either of amassing or dissipating we should applaud ourselves as well as the worst of them  That proves Samuel said I that thou art thyself a little nearsighted  How doth your honour make that out Have not I always  said  you were a little bit of a miser Samuel  But your honour knows  I  would never  allow it  Upon the same principle  I have now and then said since the building of  ShenstoneGreen  that  I was a prodigal hey  But your honour would never  admit  it In short sir the man who commits an errour and the man who criticizes it have each of them different words to express the same thing What I call profusion you call generosity what you call avarice I call discretion So that you may depend on the sincerity of the prisoners in his majesty's Fleet But lay them by as a foreign matter and let us come nearer your honour  He now gave me N  o    Why this is going backwards said I  No matter answered the steward for the order of numbers I offer them to your honour in the order of importance beginning with the least atrocious and so going regularly on to the greater  Though Samuel said this very coolly it set me on the tremble After the petition of the prisoners I did not expect the matter to soar higher But you shall judge reader how far I was mistaken when you are in the humour to amuse yourself with the next chapter  CHAP XXXIV THE PENSIONERS ARE POLITE  N  O  was addressed to Mr Sarcasm  Pray Mr Sarcasm signify to our patron that a very modest family upon the  Green  are constantly insulted by one of the pensioners who hath the next house in which he keeps an infamous  madam  within earshot of us On the first day of the races we saw her trolloping about the course in a faded silk gown and a dirty fringed petticoat on the second day she appeared in the same dress walking arm in arm with the above pensioner and since that time she  has been introduced into the man's house where she sings and swears in such a manner that we are both shocked and disturbed These two sit up best part of the night and about twelve o'clock this morning a very splendid  vis a vis  entirely new and constructed on a French model made its appearance at  madam's  door The family who complain of this grievance have  no carriage at all  nor do they think it consistent with the modesty they ought to maintain under present circumstances but they cannot with patience bear to see a  vile creature  exalted above  women of virtue  To make the matter still worse there are four more dressed up husseys of this wretch's acquaintance who are come down in a phaeton and four horses  which are driven by a great  gauky  masculine shething who gathers up the reins and smacks the long whip like a stage coachman Suggest therefore we beg of you Mr Sarcasm to the most amiable Sir B Beauchamp how much the purity of his charming Paradise must suffer by the introduction of these harlots who will not only ruin all the  Shenstonian  batchelors but throw out all their lures to alienate every husband from the arms of his honourable wife The extirpation therefore of this evil while it is yet in the bud is submitted to our patron whose virtuous heart will we are assured adopt such measures as may most effectually serve the female innocence and fidelity  which he hath so kindly taken in charge  Signed by the above family and all the other ladies of  ShenstoneGreen  This letter made so strong an impression that I desired Samuel to lay the rest of the papers by till some other time for this is an affair Samuel said I which must be taken into immediate consideration  Sir replied the steward the name of the pensioner who has been guilty of the crime in question is Danby a young gentleman who stands in my book of anecdotes as the best hearted young man in the world The character I have had of him previous to his being marked for the  Green  is this  "Danvers Danby Esq a person of fine genius unbounded generosity tender feelings lively passions and  adored by the ladies"  And is Mr Danby said I the author of such an indelicate action  Why your honour should consider that all the qualities which constitute his fine character lean as I may say wholly to  spirited things  Spirited things quotha do you consider what may be the effect of these spirited thingsMay I not have a brothel brought upon my  Green  and instead of conjugal harmony and continency may not my dear  Shenstone's  system  Suppose sir your honour was to tell the  Shenstonians  once for all a piece of your mind I think something might be done yet  If thou canst advise any thing to give my perplexed head and heart a little ease pray good fellow lose no time let me know it I thought I should both  give  and  receive  happiness but I am horridly mistaken upon my soul I am Mr Sarcasm  Here this ludicrous Mr Sarcasm in whom a dry kind of rigid remark was constitutional sat down at a desk which stood in the room and wrote as follows  Sir  BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP  Bart To the  LADIES  and  GENTLEMEN  Pensioners of  SHENSTONEGREEN  LADIES and GENTLEMEN  WHEN I offered you and yours a sanctuary in my village I meant to assist your distresses and not to support your passions and natural appetites which I imagined you would be prudent enough to leave behind you in the several sorry places where I picked you up I gave each of you a good house and a good fortune because  before  you had neither of those comforts but I had no idea that you would plague me with any of the little human weaknesses which so ill  correspond with the purity and paradisaick system I wanted to establish It is therefore insisted that while you are under my patronage you cast out all improper affections whatsoever and walk inoffensively backwards and forwards over the  Green  between meals or that you will at least  Pshaw Mr Sarcasm said I peevishly interrupting him do you imagine I am in a temper to be trifled with  Scarce had these words passed my lips before a fine elegant splendid and prepossessing young man came into the room with an air of ingenuous distress  It was Mr Danby He fell upon his knee My dear sir said he my  worthy protector I am this instant informed of the offence I have given to some of the persons in our neighbourhood I have done wrong sir I feel I repent Had I reflected but a moment it would have been impossibleThe woman struck my fancyI am too apt to follow my feelings and my sensibility is generally wounded too late  After such language Mr Danby what can I say I am disarmed  The woman is no longer under my roof sir Upon my honour I have dismissed her  It is sufficient Mr Danby I hope there will be no further bad consequence I see your forgetfulness in the true light and I do not doubt  Matilda who had been sitting to embroider in the next room now opened the glass door which looked into the apartment where we were talking and rushed in with a countenance like the paleness of death  Mr Danby's confusion was visible in every feature He reassured me that every thing should be done to my utmost satisfaction and abruptly withdrew  I was sensibly alarmed and desiring the steward to postpone the rest of the business till the next morning my daughter and I were left together  She was still labouring with some concealed anxiety and after fixing her eyes on me very tenderly for some minutes she fell at my feet and bathed my hand with her tears  Matilda said I for God's sake consider your poor father  I am very young papa perhaps very foolish and am now kneeling for my father's instructionThat that young gentleman who is just gone out sirthat young gentleman sir  Hahgo on Matilda  Has given me the greatest misery ever since he has been at the  Green  How so Matilda  Don't be angry with me dear papabut even if you are I must speak out my whole heart I have met him at Miss Elliot's His figure His conversationHis mannerI am  afraid I love him sir Indeed I am afraid of it  Love him did you say Matilda  But he is a libertinehe is a rake I have heard his whole storyYet sir he  confessed  his errourhe is not a shameless manhePray sir did he not say the woman who had seduced him was  dismissed  Ah Matildayou are the dear and darling comfort of my life Heaven knows how long this project of happiness which I have put into execution upon this  Green  may be depended on The edifice was flattering and fair but perhaps it may not prove solid The gust of ingratitude may weaken and the tempest of contrary passions may destroy it It is possible  that this little paradise which I have raised like a second Eden around me may like the first which was regulated by more powerful patronage be equally lost In that case my Matilda will be the only flower that will remain of all my garden  Her  sweetness and beauty must soothe me in every disappointmeet and supply the place of the angel who gave her beingAlas MatildaI am even jealous of your affections but I would not keep them  all  when your tender heart disposes you to divide them Of Mr Danby we know a little His qualities are fine but they are dangerous Yet we will enquire I will for your sake have over him the eye of a father and if it can possibly  be  you shall not want  Before I could end the sentence she was weeping upon my neckAh my dear papa said she but this is not all My heart will burst if you are not acquainted with every thing I cannot support the  burden  of hypocrisy  Not  all  MatildaIn heaven's name what do you mean Speak this moment  He hath been in distressI myself saw him send all he could command in the world to a poor family to which he hath obligations I myself too saw the piercing letter in which the application was made and and  Speak child Conceal nothing  As he had not enough to satisfy his heart or do them the full service he desiredI gave him my little newyear's purse and  What more  Borrowed twenty guineas of a friend  What friend child  Mr Seabrooke sirBut I did not mention namesPray don't hate meI never concealed any thing before  Matilda Matilda said I taking her in my arms I am not angry I am both afflicted and rejoiced Leave the management of this business to me Act as before and all may be well One truth however is  clear Let us establish what systems or what societies we please joy and sorrow shall be for ever mixed and wheresoever we fix our dwelling whether in a great city or on  ShenstoneGreen  they will pursue us close and command alternately our smiles and tears  Hush said Matilda Mr Seabrooke is coming to the door Not a word of Mr Danby  CHAP XXXV WHICH INTRODUCES AN OLD SOLDIER  MR Seabrooke had no sooner entered than he presented to me a letter which he said he had just before taken from the postman whom he saw on his return from walking  To Sir  BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP  SIR  I am a lame and  deafish  man who was first cut to pieces in his majesty's service and after that being a man of no interest hopped and begged upon his majesty's highway On hearing of your scheme  I thought it might be now and then a penny in the way of my distress to try my luck near  ShenstoneGreen  for I naturally thought that people who were supported  themselves  by the generous would be generous to others So I made a journey of about six weeks travelling for you must consider sir I go upon a wooden horseand I am very lately got here where I walked round and round the  Green  But alas sir begging is but a bad business even in a village which was built up by the hand of charity I do not like to complain because I know the world and because I would not dishonour my cloth but I find this town so much worse for  me  than any other that were  it not for the goodness of two persons I should move my timber legs out of  ShenstoneGreen  and trust again to the turnpike road  One of those personsGod bless himis Master Henry Hewit who says he was once a very poor man himself the other is one Squire Danby who says he knows that old lads like me who have lost their limbs in a glorious cause do not choose to take money  gratis  so by way of making me believe that I  earn  mine orders me to walk his horse backwards and forwards then lead him to water then back to stable then take off his saddlefor which service he gives me very often a whole guinea  because he says he chooses to pay people according to their rank in life and if I had not fought in the field for my country  longer  than I could stand I should not Mr Danby says so often see the picture of the king my master whom I have defended in the  best  metal  I write this to tell you sir that if by chance you should see a large tawny looking oldish fellow hopping about the  Green  you should not think I am a nuisance because I am getting rich between my two friends abovementioned and when I have saved towards twenty pounds will set up a bit of a shop live by  fair commerce and trouble folks no more  I am sir your honoured humble servant to command HACKNEY OLDBLADE  P S I saw your honour's steward on the road some time ago when he was  hunting up  Misery but I believe I had not limbs enough for his purpose  As I knew the delicacy of my poor girl's affection I gave her this letter to read when she was at leisure pretending that it was a matter of no consequence but might perhaps amuse her a little I could see the idea of Mr Danby mount into her eyes as I gave it  She put the letter into her pocket from which moment she was so anxious and uneasy that she pretended a sudden indisposition as an excuse for retiring early to her chamber  In less than half an hour she returned declaring that her illness was gone and she never was so well or so happy in her life though it appeared plainly by a redness that remained about her eyes she had been weeping What a paradox is pleasure  The truth is I was little less affected or less pleased than herself at this new trait we had discovered in young Danby and I resolved if possible to make him every way worthy my Matilda I hope reader she is by this time  thy  favourite  CHAP XXXVI HUMAN NATURE LOOKED AT IN AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION  PRETTY early the next morning my daughter was bestirring herself in the pantry and just as I came down stairs had thrown a white napkin over a little wicker basket which she said was destined for Master Hackney Oldblade Give him this new guinea too Matilda said I and tell him it is the latest that has been struck of his sovereign I send it as a token that I think him no nuisance upon  ShenstoneGreen  where he may stay and settle  Matilda tripped away with her provisions without waiting to hear more and just as she was gone one of Master Oldblade's friends Henry Hewit made his appearance  Though the conversation which ensued at this interview is very extraordinary I hope honest reader thou hast heart enough to suppose it not so  far  out of nature as to be impossible If I show thee conduct in a poor unlettered peasant which discovers an excellence in humanity which thou didst not before suspect  belonged thereto  be grateful for the pleasure I shall give thee and do not say  that  is  unnatural  which may only be  uncommon  Sir said Henry pulling off his hat with great reverence I have been  some days a miserable fellow and as I look upon your honour to be my father I want to tell you why and wherefore I am thus wretched  Henry speak  Your honour has as I may say almost killed me with kindness Pray do not think me wicked if I say how much happier I was when  ShenstoneGreen  was building than I am now it is finished Ever since I had strength in my armsand you see sir I am built almost like a church I have been used to labour I have worked dear good sir till work is my play and play is my work yes your honour I have found it harder to pass my time since I had nothing to do than ever it was for me to getup  and go to bed with the sun I will tell your honour  why  Do so honest Henry  When I was a labouring man I knew that I must not eat nor drink till I had done  so much  for bread and  so much  for bed When that  so much  was finished I sat me down to a repast which was so sweetened by my hunger that every morsel was a feast Then I went hobbling home at night as weary as weary So much the better I made but one sleep of it till daylight and then got up as gay as a bird to weary myself again  But your situation Henry is much more easy now on  ShenstoneGreen  Too easy a great deal too easy sir I do not know that the bones are the better for stretching on a velvet cushion Had I a good education I might perhaps amuse myself with good books or maps or such things but as I can neither read or write so as to make any pleasure of it tis but making my head ache to no purpose No sir here lies the mischief I am a man worth two hundred a year and have got my fine house over my head my old workclothes are thrown away I have things upon my back that do not sit at all to my liking I am not company for the other pensioners who have most of them spent a good fortune before they came to the  Green  I think they look too as if they laugh at me when I go by any  of them as they stand idling at their doors This conceit hurts my clown's pride so mortally that I keep out of their sight as much as I can and towards the evenings give them the slip out of my back door Sometimes I escape to the next parish where my old fellowlabourers live But even there I do not find myself at home as usual because they geer and fleer and are jealous of my good fortune and say they cannot think what your honour could see in my face to stick me up for a gentleman After this I am obliged to make them all nearly drunk before they will own me for an old acquaintance Besides this sir I see your honour's  tradesmen  hate me and think they have one and all a  better right to your bounty than Henry Hewit  They may think as they please but I consider Henry Hewit as the best and worthiest man upon  ShenstoneGreen  Too good your honour is too good for what can I do I have no exercise and so have no appetite I always am feeling for my leather apron I sometimes catch up my old trowel and am ready to shed tears over it as if it were because I had thrown away with  it  an old friend that used to get me the brown bread that I  bought myself  I cannot sleep at nights because I am in a sort of a doze all the day In short sir I look upon it that I am living a very wicked life and  with your honour's leave I will  mend  it  Is that possible friend Henry  Very possible sir as thus I will return my pension to the dear noble hand out of which I received it I will live in a little snug house amongst your honour's tradesmen I will take care the people shall know my mind that there may be no envy nor heartburning and I will if your honour thinks fit be master mason and bricklayer of all  ShenstoneGreen  For this your honour may pay me from  time to time  but not all at once so that though I shall return to my own track and to my own tradewhich few know betteryet I shall never want either victuals or work and to a  poor fellow like me to want  one  of these is to want  both  And are you serious Henry  So serious and please your honour that I shall break my heart if you do not oblige me But this is not all I think I know  whom  your honour might put into the house and fortune which I shall quit  I would gladly have a person of my friend Hewit's recommendation  Then you must know sir there is a fine old creature mangled all over who has set his face against our enemies till his trade is fairly cut from him by the naked sword He is a very merry good soul and when I saw him the other day walking on his  wooden stumps I said to myself Oh Henry Hewit Henry Hewit there is a man who ought to be in thy place He is robbed at once of his business and his blood be an honest lad and go back to thy labour Henry and speak a good word for a gentlemansoldier whose hairs are grey and whose limbs are gone I cried like a child as I said this but if your Honour agrees to my two proposals I will do nothing but work and laugh all the rest of my life  I do agree Henry and you shall have it just in your own way  Then sir if you please I will begin to work tomorrow for I have been sideling backwards and forwards and I see there are some repairs wanting  in the brickwork about the Mansionhouse The tiling on the left side is loosened and I have spied out a crack or two in the back chimnies  one  leans a little  What then Henry your  eyes  have been at work already  Use you know sir is second nature I never see a building of any kind if it is of brick but I can tell what  should  be done in a trice It is in my way Lord your Honour how happy you have made me but the cement will be better if I were to mix my lime over night I will go then and temper my mortarLord how happy I amto say the real factotum I never was so happy in  my life I must kiss your Honour's hand I must indeed  Here the poor excellent fellow leaped about with unaffected joy and was carried away into many extravagant gestures by sensations which do not frequently I fear interrupt the tranquility of human beings  Just as he was going out he turned round to desire I would not mention his name in the affair of the hopping soldier because said Henry it will have a better look if your Honour was to say you had heard of Master Oldblade's great  fighting feats  and made him a pensioner for the sake of your country  that  your Honour knows would please the old fellow for all your swordblade gentry  have a sort of pride about them as to  me  you may tell him that I am a good bricklayer and mend a crack or lay a tile for my country as bravely as any man but for the matter of fighting I am a mere mess of milk and never killed any thing in my life Say I am gone to my old business and had only Master Oldblade's house for  a time  To make any comment on this behaviour on the part of our bricklayer would be to suspect the reader's sense and sensibility  I leave it therefore with his feelings  CHAP XXXVII THE REVERSE OF THE PICTURE  BUT human nature having in the two last chapters exibited her bright side we must now be content to look on the reverse of her picture  Mr Samuel Sarcasm who was ever scrupulously exact to his appointments appeared with the rest of the papers which remained unexamined  Now Samuel said I I have time to finish  He gave me N  o  which reader I make thee a present of with all my heart  To Sir  BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP  By Favour of  S SARCASM ESQ  OUR DEAR SIR BENJAMIN  WE the female part of your pensioners who in the former portion of our lives were accustomed to enjoy the innocent amusements of the world find ourselves rather  ennuyed  as the French say for although to walk over the velvet green or the shady wood to watch the opening of the flowers and budding of the bushesthough these and other rural amusements be exceedingly pleasant in the summer yet with long nights come upon us the desires of reenjoying the entertainments of the winter To provide these therefore  for the cold weather has been the grand object of our consultations for some days and we think we have at length hit upon a plan of progressive pleasures which will carry us agreeably through the gloomy months till groves and gardens again become  sufferable  FIRST WE are making a purse of a few hundreds to establish a sweet little epitome of a  Pantheon  where we will though at a small expence have our vocal gods and goddesses at least twice a week And we will call it by way of compliment  ShenstoneGreen Pantheon  SECONDLY WE knowing perfectly well all the arts of surprize and delicate slight propose also a kind  of  Cornelys  where our lights rooms and partitions shall shift about at the word of command This must be named  The Country Cornelys on ShenstoneGreen  THIRDLY WE earnestly intreat your assistance in erecting a building for  Theatrical  works to be written by ourselves and our husbands and to be acted by one another Though this scheme will certainly be attended with some expence yet it will be such an encouragement to genius as will raise up in the pensioners a laudable emulation and indeed not to have a playhouse upon  ShenstoneGreen  which is as it were  poets ground  and ought to be dedicated to the muses would be a sin and a  shame Besides if we should not be able to furnish new pieces amongst ourselves there are plenty of playwrights who will send us their  chef d'aeuvres  from the capital where you know interest has now and then the key of the stagedoor and where the managers  themselves  generally forestall the dramatick market We have been looking about the  Green  and find that our playhouse will stand vastly well  near the Church  or rather between that and Parsonage+place So that the muses will be supported by the temple of devotion on one hand and a doctor of divinity on the other This we will call  ShenstoneGreen Theatre  FOURTHLY WE above all other things have set our hearts upon a  Masquerade  which is at once so innocent so elegant and so universally admired that not to have a monthly one on  ShenstoneGreen  would be such an impeachment upon our want of taste as never was heard of This therefore must be put in hand immediately Masks and dominos may be had from Tavistockstreet London Fancydresses depend on ourselves  LASTLY WE propose a weekly  Concert of Musick  and for cheapness sake the same band may serve for the orchestra of our theatre But as these dear amusements will under your patronage sir be ours we shall by way of getting back some of our charges tax all tickets taken by strangers The  Shenstonian  pensioners  being the only persons to be admitted gratis excepting our good and amiable patron Sir Benjamin who is in  each  place to have a lodge with a decorated canopy fitted up and properly illuminated under the title of Beauchamp Box or the Lord President's Place on  ShenstoneGreen  Signed by all the Ladies of the  Green  except Miss Eliza Elliot who obstinately refuses but as we consider that girl a particular kind of creature too grave and too glum for her age her suffrage hath not been much solicited  Here endeth reader the ladies petition and here beginneth a new chapter with a sigh  CHAP XXXVIII THE WHISTLER WHISTLES LUSTILY ALL THROUGH THIS CHAPTER  HEIGHO Samuel this is promising work Is it not  Since the writing hereof sir there have been some of the fair petitioners at my office just to strengthen their arguments by assuring your Honour that with those few diversions mentioned in their list they will undertake to make  ShenstoneGreen  superior either to Bath or Paris They add furthermoreand as all spoke of it  together  there is the less doubt of their sinceritythat there shall not be a single hour in the day or night but what shall bear its characteristic  amusement  ShenstoneGreen  Samuel I believe they might say  old  Samuel  ShenstoneGreen  old Samuel shall have more  ton  than any spot in the habitable globe and by the crouds of fashion which we shall gather about us the jubilees of the dear poet  Shenstone  shall be more  vivant  and more  vogueish  than those even headed by his mirrour Mr Garrick of Shakespeare himself After this they fluttered out of my office which was never so perfumed before  And would you not  prevent  this inundation of luxury which Samuel cannot possibly be admitted without an inundation of folly also  Prevent it sir said Matilda who was sitting on Mr Seabrooke's knee  Why would you prevent it What can be more harmless than a Pantheon  Whew  said Mr Seabrooke  More innocent than a Cornely's said Matilda  Whew  said Mr Seabrooke  More moral than a playhouse demanded Matilda  Whew    Whew  replied Seabrooke  Or more enchanting than a masquerade asked Matilda  Whew    Whew    Whew  answered Mr Seabrooke lengthening and loudning his tone and taking Matilda in his arms into the garden  You hear Mr Seabrooke's sentiment of the matter Samuel said I  I must own sir the gentleman's whistle is loud against it I take those  Whews  all to be in the negative flatly in the negative  Shall I then forbid such nonsenses Mr Sarcasm  Your Honour half tempteth  me  to  Whew  in the manner of the merry gentleman who is playing at romps yonder on the grassplats with Miss Matilda What signifies your Honour's forbidding a large party of ladies doing the things which they have  set their hearts upon  Sure your Honour knoweth as little of women as men  But I so well know the consequence Samuel I am so well convinced that  ShenstoneGreen  would be in as much  agitation and rattle as London were I to suffer these nonsenses  And that is the very reason sir why the ladies will certainly carry their designs into execution  nem con Rattle  is the thing they admire  Indeed Samuel  Besides sir they offer only to introduce things that are allowed in  all  genteel places and though your honour chooses to run down causes to their effects women seldom go that way to work they stick firmly to the cause and if that tickles they never look far enough to pick up a nasty consequence that would only put the poor dears into a perspiration Again sir have you not made them  independent and the free agent  doth  as he listeth I have heard  There Samuel is the rub I have tied my hands voluntarily behind me I left all to the operations of grateful hearts and imagined that such liberty would be law at  ShenstoneGreen  It is plain therefore that your Honour must give up this point so we will go to another  With a very bad grace I can assure thee Mr Sarcasm  Things not possible your Honour knows should not be attempted Please to mark therefore your consent and I will signify the same to the ladies who protested they should neither eat drink or sleep till I sent  your answer 'Tis a lady's maxim sir to be restless till she hath her fair longing  I now wrote underneath this petition which was by the by abominably scrawled agreeable to Dr Swift's observation from corner to corner the word  granted  and my hand so trembled as I gave my sanction to folly that I wrote  almost  as unintelligibly polite as the ladies  Sarcasm signed the petition as witness with a fist perfectly firm and saying he imagined I had enough for one day adjourned till another opportunity the examination of the other papers  CHAP XXXIX IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE A CONSTABLE ON SHENSTONEGREEN  I HAD scarce time to breathe upon this circumstance before one of a different kind but tending equally to show me I was but a foolish fellow started up in the form of the following intelligence which by way of desert was brought just after I had dined  To Sir  B BEAUCHAMP  HONOURED PATRON  THE abandoned women whom a certain young  Shenstonian  first countenanced and then dismissed have not yet quitted the village though we understand they were  furnished by Mr Danby with money sufficient to take them to whence they came Seeing them flare about the neighbourhood from day to day to the great annoyance of female virtue which is under the shadow of Sir Benjamin's wings I sought out the haunt which they frequent and by virtue of mine holy office exhorted them to quit our  Paradise  threatning at the same time that if they did  not  they should be first excommunicated and then driven out by the angel of our garden with a flaming sword They answered hereunto very unseemly first saying that they had as much right to live in  Paradise  as a parson and that as to excommunication that would only be to forbid them going to a  place which is the last public exhibition they should at any time think of troubling After this they changed their address and desired me to sit sociably down Albeit my profession might be degraded and my cloth stained by sitting me down amongst the naughty ones I resolved for once to approach pollution in the hope of wiping it away with holy exhortation Hereupon I rehearsed that chapter of the everlasting volume which the scriptural sage in the character of a father giveth to young men I began with  My son my son  hearken unto the words of my mouth cand went quite throughBut mark the progress of abandoned hearts All the time I was predicating they  assumed an affected gravity which imposed upon my simplicity One of them patted me upon my cheek under pretence of praising the voice with which I exhorted and squeezed my hand while she declared I had the true pulpit deportment A second stroaked my chin and observed that as eloquence was apt to parch the tongue it might be as well if I were to call for my bottle while the thirdfor the fourth had fled elsewhere for shamedrew her palm along my knee and even to the taper of my thigh saying she wished her  eyes might drop out of her head  if I was not a very proper man Now it was that I perceived I had got into a den of thieves who wanted to steal away the virtue  which I came to inspire Yes my honoured patron three pair of black eyessent their flames at my honour and it was only by a precipitate retreat after being much stirred in which I lest my hat and wig which they swore should pay for my priggish impertinence that I could save mine integrity from the snare As I ran baldheaded from the door they hooted me with one accord and strange to tell I have been scarce out of my bed since  It is incumbent that these evils be done away and that these fair devils be cast out of  ShenstoneGreen  which otherwise will be like unto the Strand where once upon a time I  was carried off in my canonicals and stripped of every thing but MY PURITY  I am honoured patron Your humble servant CHARLES CUSHEON  ParsonagePlace  How one imprudence treads on another said I after having read this letter aloud  But you see said  Matilda  smiling the bad women are wholly gone from Mryou  knows who's  papa  I concealed Mr  Danby's  name at the time of reading this letter  I begin to think friend Beauchamp said Mr Seabrooke we must have such a thing as a CONSTABLE in this  same  ShenstoneGreen Sic transit gloria mundi  A constable answered I in great consternation a  constable  on  ShenstoneGreen  Faith I begin to think so too said the little apothecary who that day dined at the Mansionhouse and who had been thrown into an immoderate fit of laughter by the ludicrous idea of the baldheaded priest when he was on the retreat And now you talk of that said Mr Elixer I have a little private business to communicate  Matilda withdrew Mr Seabrooke rose up from the table And can my dear Seabrooke think it possible for him to retire  Whew  replied he wheeling off into the garden where he would sometimes pass half a day upon the grassplats in the sunshine  Lookyou my dear cried the worthy Welchman when we were alone I have got a proclamation of war in my pocket Yes my dear war has been declared in  ShenstoneGreen  for some time and here is a correct list of the killed and wounded Elixir  Ned  must knock them  dead  yet Read read  "A list of patients now under the cure of Edward Elixir apothecary and surgeon to the  Shenstonian  pensioners"  But look you my patron said the doctor I do not let you see this to  betray the confidence which should be sacred in my profession but because I am a little man who loves gratitude and thinks he ought to have no secrets with a person like Sir Benjamin Beauchamp for  that  Sir Benjamin has made me Edward Elixir the richest and the gayest and the happiest man in Wales Yes I do say the happiest man in Wales My little wife Sir Benjamin has got through your kindness a large easy chair which runs upon castors and I aired her yesterday for the first time all about the  Green  Yes and then we both laughed together at the conceit till our mirth became as it were a  contagious disorder  which put into convulsions all the pensioners who beheld us If you had seen sir  this sight how you would have laughed Only to think of such a slender hopo'mythumb as I harnessed to a kind of gocart almost as big as a waggon running off at full speed with such an amazing finesized firmfleshed woman as my wife Only think of a skipping flea hopping away with the majestic elephant Oh Jesus my patron my patron how happy you have made Teddy Elixir  Teddy Elixir now falling into one of his pleasurefits I left him to enjoy it upon a sopha where he rolled about while I read his list of killed and wounded  D Danby Esq  Attendance every day  C Cusheon Vicar  Every day but Sunday  Without going any farther I expressed my hearty concern for these gentlemen and desired to know the nature of their disorders Are  these  pensioners wounded or killed Mr Elixir It must be a very sudden affair  Alas sir answered the apothecary Venus wounds in a moment  Venus Mr Elixir Venus  Lookee you my patron you live here at your Mansionhouse without knowing what passes in your village We have of late been visited by four Venuses who have brought more business upon my hands than I ever had on the  Green  before There is warm work going on I promise you but sir you still my patron I will send Venus packing I warrant I will blow a little powder in her bright eyes that shall make her remember coming upon  Shenstone Green  never fear  The plain truth then Mr Elixir divested of your embellishment is that the unhappy women who were attracted to the  Green  by those confounded races have  Yes yes my patron exactly  that  my patron Exactly  that  And amongst other victims less distinguished are I presume these gentlemen  Jesus my patron how well you guess If I could have guessed half so well I wish I may never laugh again  And do you think this a laughing matter Mr Elixir  My patron it is no more than this skip Our methods of treating that affair are now so infallible that  But the wickedness and the impropriety of the affair how will you cure that Mr Apothecary That is something more than your skip I hope is it not  Lookyou my dear patron Edward Elixir never meddles with other men's business I stick close to the  carcase  which I know how to manage  tolerably well But as for the  mind  that is clean out of my way That is a branch belonging to Mr Cusheon the vicar I can only master  Death  it is the parson who should struggle with the  Devil  Ha ha ha  But I am astonished Mr Elixir that so sober discreet and  classical  a man as Mr Cusheon should  Why should my patron be astonished that asober discreet classical man should catch one of the commonest distempers now in the world We are all liable to accidents Alas the  classics  are not exempt from the strokes of the  female gender  But his  profession  Mr ElixirHa ha ha  Lack a day if you think the worse of him for what I have told you my patron I shall be the most miserable man in the worldThere is my blind side I am so used to run about with what I hear in order to tell it which is the way I worked myself first into any practise for one cannot take a pint of blood from a  country  patient but he will have from me a pound of news into the bargain so that I cannot help chattering let the consequence be what it will This is the complaint that every body makes against me while almost every body tempts me to sin Oh how I do hate Mr Edward Elixir how I do hate Mr Edward Elixir  But hear me Mr Apothecary hear meit is an affair of moment I am hurt I am stung  Oh my patron tell me I pray you what can make me such a little infamous apothecary as I am Why should I cure my patient with my hand only to wound him again worse than ever with my tongue Curse my tongue how dare it jabber out things sacred and profane in this manner You ought to discard me my patronfor Mr Cusheon is a soft sleek gentle gentleman as ever put on a cassock and Mr Danby is the best and most generous esquire that ever came into Wales What things do I know of his doing and have I blabbed the  only  thing that could injure him in the esteem of my patron Oh what a complete little villain I am Oh Elixir Elixir skilled as thou art in simples thou  art the most atrocious rascal of a small man that ever breathed a vein Lookyou my patron lookyou if it was not for my poor little wife who would die if she lost her trundler I would deliver myself into the hands of justice and be hanged directly EdwardEdward Teddy Teddy Elixir Elixir Fie fie fie  While our medical phaenomenon was uttering this rhapsody he sometimes addressed  me  then  himself  sometimes stood so as to observe his figure in the glass as if willing to have his own image in view while he loaded it with abuse and sometimes he pranced about the room in an agony of rage twitching his wig from side to side and leaping from chair to chair But at length the  vociferation with which he mentioned his being hanged c brought Seabrooke and Matilda into the room where they apprehended something was the matter Seeing them advance the wretched apothecary imagining they were come to hear his difgrace caught up his hat as was always his custom and after assuring us once more that he was a most infamous little rascal ran out of doors  CHAP XXXX A DISCOVERY WHICH NONE COULD HAVE EXPECTED  I WAS contriving how to conceal the circumstance of Mr Danby from my poor panting Matilda who always suspected the conversation turned upon him though she even had discretion enough to conceal his very name from Seabrooke Just as I had hit off an excuse which I imagined plausible a most violent thundering at the front door announced four visitors who were never in the Mansionhouse before They were of the female kind and three of them so ridiculously discoloured by  paint and so burnt with flaming robes and ornaments that the gentle Matilda who was habited simply in an unpretending tenderlooking lustring and a white straw hat bound with a single peagreen band looked like the angel of peace by the side of the furies She hurried into Seabrooke's arms and from that sancturary beheld the scene  Sir said one of the women cocking up the corner of her hat I suppose you are the proprietor of this  ShenstoneGreen  I am madam  If you are then sir I should be glad to know how a gentleman pluming himself upon his generosity can suffer four unhappy women who are  obliged to attend publick places to be insulted  I really do not understand you madam  Let  me  speak Nancy to him said a second woman more furiously capped and hatted than the other I think your name is Sir Benjamin Beauchamp  I am so called madam  Pray then Sir Benjamin Beauchamp what right have your virtuous bhs of the  Green    Whew  cried Mr Seabrooke giving a louder whistle than I ever before heard and running out of the room with the everdelicate Matilda  So much the better said the woman resuming the conversation Now Miss Mock Modesty is gone I can speak my mind plainer I was going to ask sir why you permit such virtuous bhs as some of your pensioners to  sneer  at us as we pass their doors  I suppose you are the ladies who have created such disturbances then in the village if so you cannot wonder at any slights you may have received for the irregularity of your conduct  Pray Sir Benjamin let  me  speak said a third woman of a less bold appearance more decently dressed and extremely fine featured These ladies sir are apt to be warm in their tempers  I have seen more misfortunes and am more tranquil Have I leave to speak sir  You have madam  The four women Sir Benjamin who are now before you have been all ruined by your sex We had once the innocence of your own daughter Each had too tender a heart and threw away its noblest affections upon a villain who deceived it Our parents thrust us from their protection and the door of every friend was shut against us The women of virtue who perhaps have given few real  proofs  of it often told us we might honestly  work  for a subsistence But this is only one of the many pretences of goodluck when it wants an apology for insulting distress  Who will employ an handsome young woman discarded by her natural friends and left struggling in the streets We have found no such protectors What remained after such unhappy experience To put ourselves into  eternity  would have added the crime of murder to the misfortune of violation To expect assistance from men on any pure or disinterested principle was absurdity Our youth our beauty our forlorn situation were all arguments against such protection Which is it sir of  your  sex that will honourably shelter our's under such circumstances or which is it that does not rejoice to see a lovely form  reduced to purchase  To  exist  sir is the natural effort of an human being and you know  the terms on which our bread was to be procured Why then should we be insulted Why should complaints be formally lodged against us as we understand they are by persons who have better luck than ourselves With regard to our coming to this village we have alas but too solid an apology for it We are the slaves of publick events and always obliged to have a look out for novelties we are compelled to take advantage of any thing that may promise a prospect of support We shift our habitations as men shift theirs and whenever any place is celebrated as the resort of much company there alas it is our fatal lot to go and partake the transient popularity without the joy It was told to us by those whom  we employed for such purposes that a person of fortune had erected a new town for the use of those whom mischance had brought into decay We dared not propose ourselves as  candidates  but we thought that those who leaped suddenly into prosperity from the lowest state of indigence or oppression were the proper objects to relieve us Lightly come lightly go you know sir It was probable that the passions would lead to dissipation  such  as became  all at once  masters of a good fortune Upon the faith of this expectation we set off for  ShenstoneGreen  where we thought we had as natural a right to try our fortune as any other vagabonds As to your principle of building this town upon the basis of  purity  we are unhappily not in situations to pay much regard to such ideas Delicacy is obliged to yield to necessity in our unfortunate case perhaps sir we might in luckier situations have contributed as much to the glory of  Shenstone Green  and merited as much the bounty of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp as those who now treat us with indignity Nay sir I even think that hard as it is with us you might have founded your village upon a basis of juster and  truer  benignity  How so madam said I not a little affected by her discourse or with the firm yet gentle manner in which it was deliveredIn what particulars could I have improved the plan of  ShenstoneGreen  Pardon me sir resumed the young woman if I say your bounty might at the same expence have been led through more beneficent channels some of its streams might surely have extended to US  I started  Yes sir continued the lady you may start but believe me  ShenstoneGreen  hath not included the  most  pitiable part of the creation nor indeed  that  part which under proper regulation have the most pathetic claim upon the proprietor's attention Custom it is true may deaden the delicacy of those feelings which are the distinguishing ornaments of the female and habit may assist extreme indigence in conquering our natural decency but it is not always a sign  that we are  irreclaimable  when we yield ourselves up to the only alternative that is left Even the unwarrantable language we sometimes make use of may find a palliative in the extremities to which we are driven Those sir who live in a more  elevated  state of misfortune as they are liable to the brutality only of  one man  so are they less excuseable if they commit those crimes which it is in their power to prevent For in my opinion errours are pardonable and punishable in proportion as the situation of the culprit renders them more  necessary  Crimes  necessary  madam said I  It is very possible sir for certain faults to be if not  necessary  at least  inevitable  They are annexed to a condition which can neither be prevented by the person who is reduced any more than the faults which result from  This doctrine I fear madam cried I interferingThis doctrine will not  Sir said the lady interrupting in her turn I advance only what I know to be fatally true My ignorance in the arts of argument may perhaps involve the fact I desire to explain in some obscurity or in too many words but I am nevertheless convinced of the fact itself How for instance is it possible to prevent the effects of  our  distress We are  obliged to the dreadful drudgery of suiting ourselves to publick caprice We are obliged to consult every man's particular mode of gratification Nature I believe sir leads to a decent behaviour but there are I fear five perverted appetites which lean to the grossest pleasure to one that is delicate or true to the original bias of the human feelings I myself Sir Benjamin am an example of the truth I would illustrate I remember the time when the excess of my timidity was imputed to me by my relations as a fault I blushed almost at myself In this state of my innocence when all the affections were fair and impressive a man pretended a generous passion and when he had thoroughly  made it reciprocal by breathing a real ardour into a guiltless heart he abused it The old story was again repeated I was treated as the toy which could please no longer and bequeathed by this barbarous betrayer to his brotherrakes  These  were all in the higher ranks of libertinism and for that reason I heard less vulgar language and saw fewer  examples  of vice So that though it would be absurd to represent myself as a virtuous woman I should have been left wholly without an apology had I been plunged so deep as my companions  What are not you as wicked a wretch as us Fanny cried all the other women  Give me leave resumed the young creatureI did not mean to insinuate that as  my  praise but as  your excuse  If you now and then yield to words that might be better not spoken it is I know because you have had few advantages Considering the cruelties which you have undergone the company you have been obliged to keep in order to humour the whim of your friends and the necessities you had on all hands to encounter it would be very extraordinary if you had not picked up some habits which you are far from admiring even in yourselves I very well know Sir Benjamin that good hearts beat in the bosoms of these my forlorn associates I have seen them share their  hardearned profits with those who have appealed to their bounty I have seen also the tears drop from their eyes at the agony of that rigid virtue which would not easily have been persuaded to feel as softly for them They riot it is true but it is to drown the sense of the most poignant reflection which would otherwise obtrude to their distraction They dissipate it must be confessed but it is in compliance with the wanton taste of their visitors I own even that an oath may occasionally pass their lips but it is the effect of unhappy practice and never comes deliberately from the mind  Ah madam said I you touch me too too tenderly  All the other poor creatures dropped the air of audacity and held down their heads to conceal at once their shame and their distress  If sir added the lady it is yet necessary to enlarge the features of this horrid picture that I have taken from the life suffer me to observe that we are often beaten for an air of modesty and rewarded for an appearance of wantonness we are equally the sport of the brute and of the bailiff We are shut out of society that might revive our morals and we are driven to such as of necessity must make us worse Now then tell  me sir if we are not in some sort justifiable for seeking a shelter where at least our disgrace was not so publick and where were in hope that benevolence was the same in the pensioners of  ShenstoneGreen  as in the bosom of the proprietor We came hither with such ideas and yet if my companions would condescend to take council from my example they would retire from the neighbourhood and try again their fortune in the bustles and beatings of the world For my own part sir I will delay my departure hence no longer than while I observe that if Sir Benjamin Beauchamp had contrived some quiet asylum where the blushes of the most  unhappy women might have been concealed from  While the beautiful and abused Fanny was proceeding in her sentence a person tapped at the door of the apartment and when it was opened there came hobbling in a large lame man whom I had never seen  Before the stranger entered the women had all turned their faces from the door as if unwilling to be caught in tears  I come on my stumps to your Honour said the man to thank you for your kind intentions in favour of an old battered fellow who is proud of his scars Heaven always raises up a friend to the brave I am just  told by your Honour's steward that after tugging about the globe and sustaining many strokes of the body abroad and more of the heart at home poor old  Hackney Oldblade    No sooner was this name pronounced than the most piercing shriek that surely ever was uttered came from the very soul of the young creature who had been so pathetically pleading for herself and her companions  This shriek burst from the afflicted Fanny the man no sooner heard the voice of a woman in distress than he forgot the want of his limbs and ran upon his stumps to offer assistance but the moment he cast his eye on the  sufferer whose agonies increased the crutches dropped from his hands and he fell lifeless on the floor  Mr Seabrooke and Matilda came hurrying in and just as they appeared the other three women were so agitated that they retreated in the utmost confusion  CHAP XLI HUMANITY AGAIN LOOKS EAIR AND SHINES THROUGH HER TEARS  ISTOOD fixed in amazement while Matilda was assiduously applying her smelling bottle to Fanny and Seabrooke was rubbing the temples of Oldblade  Oh Fanny Fanny cried the latter recovering see to what you have brought your miserable father  Father said MatildaOh poor poor dear  It is  you  Fanny who are the author of all these broken limbs and of all these deep furrows in the  front of poor Oldblade Your mother's heart broke the year after you left us and then I did not care what became of  me  I wasted the good fortune which uncle Tibbs left me because I wanted to wash away the thought of ever having had a daughter After this Fan I went to sea a second time spent all the profits of my first voyage near five hundred pounds got my legs knocked off all these scars in my poor breast and then came home to find all my old friends dead and beg my bread on his majesty's highway  All the time the poor fellow was uttering these sentiments he was endeavouring by every means in his power to revive and comfort the unhappy Fanny who was dissolved  in the tears of penitence and despair She drew her hand over her eyes and was by no means able to speak  Touched at this the parent assumed its irresistible authority in the bosom of the soldier so absolutely that he cried out Well well Fanny don't cry child don't take on I forgive thee all my wounds and all my sorrows Thee hast perhaps had enough of thy own But why didst thou suffer poor Hackney to hunt town and country after thee so long Where didst thee hide thy misery all that time  Indeed sirsaid Fanny raising her head but still shutting her eyes indeed I was not quite abandoned I was a solitary wretch who wept in  secret Even now though poverty drove me to seek shelter in this place I have never been able to adopt the example of my associates and had it not been for the disinterested bounty of one good gentleman on the  Green  I must certainly have starved  Of one gentleman cried Matilda in great confusion Pray what is his name  Mr Henry Hewit madam answered Fanny This good man it was who saw me unable to pursue the usual practises of my condition and took care to provide me with the necessaries of life ever since my sickness and I have been very illindeed I have  I am easy said Matilda Mr Henry Hewit is an angel I I thought it was him  But art sick  now  naughty Fan said Oldblade drawing up gently the head of her cloak round her neck Well well but are you sure it was Mr Henry Hewit that  Here Henry himself came into the room to show me how well he looked in his old working clothes He was just beginning to shake his trowel and flourish his apron when Fanny started up and exclaimedGood God my benefactor is here Bless him bless him  Lookee Master Henry said the soldier I have no knees and so I  can't cleverly come down upon them but with all the small shot which have passed through and through these arms I can with some pain which I don't heed lift them up to you as I have often lifted them up to God Almighty to thank you for the care you have taken of my poor stray daughter  Daughter exclaimed Henry throwing his trowel on the floor and have I been all this time protecting the daughter of my friend and superior Master Oldblade without knowing it Ah Miss Fanny did not I tell you things would turn out better than you imagined Poor soul your Honour she said she  wanted  to be a good girl but nobody would give  her the  means  however said she to me I have broke my mother and father's heart and so what becomes of me does not signify  My splinter of a shoulder must hurt thy naughty face Fan stay hussey and let me make thee a bit of a pillow thus said the father who took off an old silk handkerchief from his neck and spread it for the cheek of his daughter  Not give thee the  means  to be a good girl says Icontinued Hewit What and are you obliged to be wicked  against your will  Here's a world for you said ISo upon this your Honour I gave her a little of that which was of no use to me and  she promised me she would live in my house when I got into the Tradesman'sCorner and keep me tight and cleanbut don't you suppose Master Oldblade that because of this and because I am not quite an old fellow thatthat I  Stop stop Henry stop hollowed with all his force Mr Oldbladedon't say a word more Don't say any thing that must make me cut your throat If you could suppose I thought Henry Hewit capable  Capable fatherOh he isthe most  I won't be praised I won't have foolish fancies said to me Miss FannyGive  me your handIf your father says I may kiss your lips why I'll kiss them in the face of his Honour and the company and there's an end on't Here's a noise indeed about nothing  Kiss the naughty hussey if thee wilt Henry answered Oldblade but I wish I may be damned if the pain of a cannon ball made such a puling baby of me as I am at this minute I wish I may be damned if it did  Henry was advancing to Fanny who blushing ten thousand graces lifted up her head and looked at the company as if she begged us not to think of her too hardly  Good as you are Master Hewit cried Oldblade in an extacy she is my daughter she is my own dear naughty Fanny and I have a right to have the first kiss Huffey continued he almost sobbing how dare you lift your head from my neck till I bid you  Don't don't don't be so kind sir You will kill me said Fanny You will break my heart  And mine too I protest said Matilda  I will go stop the crack in your Honour's chimnies said Henry who kissed Fanny's hand as it lay on her father's bosom and then went out  Will your Honour permit said Oldblade this naughty girl to have a little room in the house which your kind heart is about to give an old soldier She shan't stay I promise you ififif  Oh FatherFather said Fanny Spare spare me  Go together honest fellow said I and take thy daughter not only to thy house but to thy heart I will be with thee presently  Master Oldblade said Mr Seabrooke who had been all the time in great agitation you and your daughter Fanny and your friend Hewit have given me some pretty severe pangs for which I shall love  all three of you while I have breath in my body  While Seabrooke was saying this Matilda was busy in adjusting the discomposed cheeks hair and hood of Fanny She wiped the tears from her eyes with her own handkerchief She smoothed the locks that hung disordered and then said to me in a whisper that she thought it would look like a little  sanction  which the poor dear seemed to deserve if I would permit  her  to go across the  Green  with Fanny Then you know papa said she none of the people will dare to think ill of her  Charmed with so exquisite and alas so uncommon a mark of female  humanity I left my permission with a kiss upon the mouth that graced the proposal Upon which Matilda ran to the glass to put on her little straw hat and then said now  Captain  Oldblade I am ready to conduct you and Fanny to your new house I know the nearest way  The father of Fanny stood amazed and Fanny herself was covered with crimson Such was the wonderful effect of that great surprizethe seeing one woman truly feel for another With much intreaty Fanny was persuaded to lay her trembling arm within that of Matilda's who seemed to be  ostentatious  of her acquaintance and in that manner they left the Mansionhouse  What an adventure hath here been and how are the events of this life brought to pass my friend said I to Mr Seabrooke  Good evening to you Sir Benjamin answered Seabrooke I am going to bed  At four o'clock in the afternoon my friend  As every thing I can possibly see betwixt this and bedtime said Seabrooke must be poor in the comparison I shall only blunt the divine edge of my present sensations by staring at  ordinary occurrences  and so I am resolved to shut myself up  from further interruption till a new day  I humoured his characteristick peculiarity and we parted  CHAP XLII CONTAINING A DUEL WHICH FEW READERS COULD FORESEE  FINDING myself left alone in the midst of such voluptuous reflections I walked forth to meet my daughter on her return that we might share them together I found her within a few yards of the Mansionhouse coming to me with full speed to tell me that she left Oldblade and Fanny in the arms of each other Yes papa said she and there the poor dear lies blushing while the soldier chides and kisses her at parting Fanny lifted up her streaming eyes and cried out in such a voice as made  me  weep tooOh Miss Matilda Miss Matilda were there many  women like you there would be more female virtue and fewer guilty wretches like Fanny Oldblade Lord papa is it so very extraordinary to behave kind to one's own sex  What right have you to call yourself names hussey there are worse than you yet said her father So seeing the old fellow going to warm something in a little saucepan on the fire which he said was a cordial to  him  in the worst of times and would be so to the naughty hussey who was nevertheless he said his own flesh and blood Then I came away papa to make you and Mr Seabrooke happy  Mr Seabrooke my dear said I is so happy already that he is gone to bed  "To eat in dreams the custard of the day"  I suppose replied Matilda in the liveliest manner applying a line from her favourite poet  Then let us eat ours my dear said I in the  wood  broad awake it is you see one of the finest evenings we could wish and "seems as it were "sent to invite the world abroad" answered Matilda using another quotation from a different author  Heighty toity child you are quite poetical to night  Quite poetical papa Lord who can help it Poetry I have heard say was first invented when the heart was too happy to be contented with prose I declare I could now repeat half the verses of  Pope  and  Shenstone  till the  village should reecho with beautiful verses  Oh brave Why then you are in the best humour in the world for an evening's walk in the wood Every leaf and flower will at this time of the night furnish a gay heart with a rhyme a simile or a sentiment  Yes papa but I have prettier things than leaves and flowers to make me poetical at present Fanny Oldblade never saw Mr Danby There papa is news for you Fanny Oldblade never saw Mr Danby  How have you found that out Matilda Oh oh let girls alone to find out secrets papa But I will tell you all about it you must know that when the women came first to town  poor Fanny was so ill as scarce to hold her head up and was obliged to keep in bed while the other women went about One of them told Mr Danby they had a sick friend at home who could not stir out upon which Mr Danby put his hand into his pocket and gave them five guineas only think papa of five guineas to buy proper comforting things for her but the cruel creatures kept all the money and Fanny never knew at all of the affair till her father who was present at the time asked her if  she  was not the person who received five guineas from Mr Danby I have received no money said she father since I have been in this part of the world except from Mr Hewit who totally supported me andFanny  papa was going on with her speech when I ran up to her and kissed her cheek ten times over  But why Matilda did you take that fit of fondness in your head just at that crisis  Why just then Oh Heavens papa How can you ask such a question I will assure you papa I loved her from that moment better than ever so without talking any more let us listen to the musick of the groves  Ye flowing Plains ye breezy Woods  Ye Bowers and gay Alcoves  Ye falling Streams ye silver Floods  Ye Grottoes and ye Groves  Upon my word Matilda you tag every tenth word with a rhyme  We were by this time wandering arm and arm in  ShenstoneWood  and propensely deviated into such paths as were least frequented but one would think that this forest was fated to produce an adventure as often as ever I entered it The curfew was just flinging its sound through the trees when all of a sudden we distinctly heard a voice coming from the left pronouncing these words Sir the clock strikes it is the moment promised I am glad to see you so exact The next moment we heard a reply to this in the clashing of swords which denoted a very obstinate engagement I am a bad swordsman sir cried some one then make use of your pistols sir replied another In a minute after two pistols were  dischargedMr Danby exclaimed some person you are wounded the blood is upon your shirt I feel it not replied Danby load again sir  To prevent any further mischief I would now have rushed forwards but my poor child had fainted at my feet and I was struggling to get her up into my arms Meanwhile the combatants again fired and a voice directly exclaimed  My God  he drops Desist sir desist he is at the point of death  The shriek which the wretched Matilda now gave went at once through her father's heart and alarmed the persons who occasioned it Two of them came rushing through the bushes and one whose name the  reader need scarce be told fell down at the feet of Matilda and cursed himself as the cause  As if sensible to his touch she opened her eyes and cried outAh Danby what have you been doing But you are safe and I am happy Here she dropped suddenly on her knee and remained in that posture some time without speaking  Though I dared not intimate my fears I saw Mr Danby's danger against whose bosom I pressed my handkerchief to stop the blood which in despite of all my efforts was flowing over his shirt But just as I was going to whisper my apprehensions to a man who thus forgot his wounds in the embraces of his mistressembraces  which I did not attempt to hinderanother person came forward who said he had extracted the ball from the side and groin of Mr Sidney  Mr Sidney exclaimed I and was Mr Sidney the antagonist of Mr Danby  Lookyou my patron replied Mr Elixirfor it was he who attended as surgeonneither Mr Sidney nor Mr Danby can possibly die while they are under my care and as to the rest though I do not know what they fought upon I know they fought like two eagles  Mr Danby now began to feel his loss of blood and I made shift to give Elixir the cue to lead him off  to examine his wound without its being suspected by Matilda Danby had already buttoned up his coat and waistcoat to prevent suspicion but the livid paleness which came suddenly over his countenance warned him it was time to get away Yet even in the midst of his agony his principal care was how to do this so as not too much to alarm Matilda assuming therefore a chearful countenance and calling into it a smile he criedWell Sir Benjamin we have had our frolick and can only say that it is to you and your fair daughter to whom we are indebted for the life of one or both of us for Mr Sidney and I were both so full of our diversion that we should certainly have gone on to the end of the  chapter had not your interruption saved us The cause of the quarrel you shall hear sir tomorrow In the mean time it is unnecessary to enjoin silence lest we should give to the idlers of  ShenstoneGreen  too delicate a subject for conversation  At the end of this speech he took off his hat with a trembling hand and walked out of the wood very slowly under the support of his two seconds Mr Elixir followed him by another path telling us that Mr Sidney was carried off by his friends and would run no risque of a discovery Elixir skipped about in triumph  Perceiving Matilda on the edge of a relapse I took her in my arms and blessed the dusk of the night which enabled me to conceal the whole matter  CHAP XLIII WHICH IS NECESSARY TO THE NARRATIVE  IT is not easy to conceive the terrour in the alteration of my poor daughter's spirits from their late elevation and as I was obliged to sit up with her the whole night I congratulated myself in the midst of my grief that Seabrooke was in bed for Matilda was so confident that her friend and instructor Seabrooke would disapprove her passion for Danby she had never once suffered his name to be hinted and it had always fallen out hitherto that when the young man came to the Mansionhouse Seabrooke  was absent Early the next morning Mr Elixir came to inform us that both the combatants were in a fair way and that Mr Danby had been to visit Mr Sidney when the quarrel had like to have been renewed for a very trifling reason namely by a dispute which arose about the propriety of Mr Danby  or  Mr Sidney's beginning the explanation which each esteemed due to their patron It is right said Mr Sidney that Sir Benjamin should be fully informed of our mistake lest he should suppose we were wantonly invading the tranquillity of his village but for  me  to tell the story would be  And if you do  not  tell it Mr Sidney replied Danby we must  have another meeting for on my part situated as I am in the family it would be gross indelicacy to speak first  But how did it  end  Mr Apothecary said Matilda rising up in her bedHow did it end  It ended madam replied Elixir giving a skip and snapping his singers just as it should do for a lady at that time coming into the chamber  A lady saids Matilda agitated into whose chamber did that lady  Mr Sidney's to be sure madam answered Elixira lady I say at that time entering the chamber ran to the bedside and cried out Oh  Sidney I heard of your situation notwithstanding all your caution  And knowing madam as you do the nice feelings of Sidney said this gentleman how have you had the imprudence to make the matter still more mysterious by this extraordinary visit  Extraordinary visit Mr Sidney what when I did not know but you were breathing your last  And if I had your delicate circumspection should have survived the very life of Sidney Miss Elliot  Miss Elliot did you say cried Matilda was that the ladyOh heavens go on dear Mr Elixir go on  Matilda took hold of the apothecary's hand and smiled I smiled too perhaps from a very different idea Mr Elixir proceeded  A short altercation ensued between all parties and when Miss Elliot understood the whole story she advised that Mr Sidney should dictate while she wrote and that Mr Danby and he should mutually sign the paper which was then to be sent by me as surgeon confident and witness  And where is that paper said I Mr Elixir There sir it is said the apothecary I will leave it with you and give the finishing stroke to the recovery of my patients  Lose no time cried Matilda and pray Mr Elixir do you know that  if you cut across PleasantPastures and leave the Tradesman'sCorner as much as possible to the left you will get there in a trice and save near a quarter of a mile by it But "Still your singer on your lips I pray  I was very glad to hear poetry returning upon Matilda  As to that madam answered Elixir I have been too infamous a little villain already not to take care of my tongue for the future  Saying this he set off with one of  his  bounds for the house of Mr Sidney and as Mr Seabrooke had not yet come from his chamber I gave Matilda an opportunity to rise which she did almost in a moment and  then she ran to a little summerhouse at the bottom of the garden where we opened the paper of explanation  CHAP XLIV THE PARTICULARS OF THE DUEL EXPLAINED  THE substance of this was that Messrs Danby and Sidney being in company together the conversation turned upon the beauties of  ShenstoneGreen  the principal and the most accomplished of whom Mr Sidney insisted was the object of  his  affections Mr Danby hereupon asserted with equal fervour that as he did not conceive there was more than one unmarried lady in the village  who could be esteemed  perfect  he imagined he had a right to ask the name of the other's favourite Sidney's scrupulous delicacy being hurt at this idea he protested that none but his Maker and himself should ever know the least syllable that might lead to the detection of so sacred a circumstance suffice it to say added he that it is impossible for Mr Danby to mistake the person who maintains her superiority over every other work of animated nature Mr Danby immediately caught fire and warned Sidney to take care how any passion  be  might indulge met a powerful rival in a man who was not any more than himself able to bear a  divided affection It appears then said Mr Sidney that we love the same person It is impossible that it should be  otherwise  replied Danby for you frankly confess there is no second person whose comparative attractions can  No sir replied Sidney the object of my affections as much surpasses every other on the  Green  as  Then there is no occasion for similes or allusions sir rejoined Danby it is clear we have the misfortune to love the same lady it only remains to examine the progress of our respective passions and to settle accordingly  My  passion sir continued Danby has been touched  with the utmost delicacy so as not to distress the innocent heart of my mistress  As to delicacy Mr Danby said the other I believe it will be allowed by the lady herself that mine not only exceeds that of Mr Danby but even her own  Sir I shall not admit your opinion in  either  instance and I have reason to think my delicacy and my application more agreeable to the lady than those of Mr Sidney  Piqued at this Sidney demanded of his friend if he would quit his pretensions without further expostulation  Never never sir answered Danby while I have the power of these arms to defend them  Then sir cried Sidney such defence will be necessary directly We must settle it without delay  The paper of explanation acquainted us further that after Mr Sidney had uttered this sentence Mr Danby and he called on Mr Elixir and one or two more friends to settle the dispute in the wood Matilda and I got there soon after and from  our  arrival to the time of the separation of the whole party particulars have been already described to the reader  It was not till after the discharge of their pistols that they came to  the simple truth of the whole matter namely that they had fought very bravely to no purpose and that the fair picture which each had drawn of his mistress did not belong to one woman but equally to Eliza and Matilda The whole only served to prove that  The lip of the nymph we admire  Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile  Well Matilda said I when we had seen this account what do you think of this business  Shall I be ingenuous papa replied she As ingenuous as is convenient my dear Why then papa since all the danger is over and both are in a very fair way I own I shall not be sorry at this new instance of Mr Danby's affection when I know he  is no longer in pain But only think of my sly friend Eliza papa I will be whipped if I ever suspected the matter and yet now I think of it her queerness about Mr Sidney  Come come Matilda said I  you  are as sly as your friend Eliza Here are you every hour almost with that sagacious whistler Mr Seabrooke and he does not so much as suspect that  Hush hush cried MatildaMr Seabrooke is now just coming to us Look how he strides along the grassplat flourishing his garters and looking to see how much sun he shall have to day  Thus terminated an unpromising scene very pleasingly  END OF VOL II
