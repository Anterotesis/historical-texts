 THE ATHENAID A POEM  VOL III  THE ATHENAID A POEM  BY THE AUTHOR OF LEONIDAS  VOL III  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXVII  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the TWENTYFIRST  SEV'N days were past when Lamachus appear'd  Before Mardonius Mighty chief he said  I hasted to Themistocles and spoke  Thy friendly words His answer first imply'd  No more than cold acceptance of the terms  For Mindarus At length two hundred prime  Of all his num'rous captives he releas'd  His minister Sicinus in the ship  Which landed me detains them near the port  Till Haliartus and the promis'd gold  Are lodg'd on board Themistocles himself  Was bound to Athens with his menial train  His wife and race We parted on the shore  To me repeating in a whisper'd tone  Thy proffers large he scornful thus reply'd  "The spoils of Asia will exceed her gifts"  Then loud thy brave defiance I pronounc'd  He with redoubled arrogance thus brief  "Rouse thy new master else the plains of Thebes  "I may attain before him" Fir'd with rage  Mardonious here If Athens do not send  By Alexander's mouth submission low  She shall become the spoil of Asian flames  Themistocles spectator of the blaze  Be swift yon Greek for Mindarus exchange  Two hundred talents promis'd shall be paid  These ransom'd warriors I appoint my guard  Brave Mindarus their captain Stern he ends  In open fight th' Athenian to confront  Magnanimous he burns his heated soul  Yields to delusion of that subtle chief  Wise like the serpent gliding through a brake  When his empoison'd jaws in silence steal  On some incautious woodman who on toil  Intent exerts his brawny strength nor deems  A foe is nigh nor hears him nor perceives  Till sore the deathinflicting wound he feels  A summons swift for embarkation flies  To Haliartus With regret he leaves  Dear friends but dearer his Acanthè's love  More prevalent his constant zeal for Greece  Combine to sooth his pain They wing his speed  To good Sicinus who the ransom'd train  Discharging tow'rds Euboea steers the keel  With Persian treasure fraught The ev'ning clos'd  When by a hasty mandate to the son  Of Gobryas Lamachus was call'd The chief  In perturbation of indignant wrath  Was striding o'er the carpet which bespread  His rich pavilion's floor His words were these  The Macedonian king is just arriv'd  From Athens I have seen him Dost thou know  That supercilious populace hath spurn'd  My condescension menac'd ev'n a prince  Their host for proff'ring kindness in my name  Such my reward To all th' Ionian Greeks  The seed of Athens I when victor left  Their democratic rule and laws unchang'd  But I will cut all freedom by the roots  From man's ungrateful race The wily Greek  Insinuating fram'd this brief reply  Perhaps the name of Xerxes may offend  Th' Athenian tribes Might Europe once behold  The son of Gobryas thron'd then Ha proceed  Mardonius answer'd Lamachus again  Doth not all Aegypt doth not Libya's clime  With Asia vast afford redundant sway  To gratify one monarch First of men  Why may not Thrace with Macedonia's realm  Thessalia Greece whate'er thy mighty arm  Shall rend by conquest from the western world  Become thy prize They willing might accept  A sov'reign like Mardonius Try their choice  AwayMardonius spake and frowning bade  The Greek retire Now left alone he mus'd  Thus questioning his heart Aspiring thoughts  Do ye awaken at the coz'ning touch  Of this vile tempter Honour while my ear  Detests th' adviser fortify my breast  Against th' adviceEnoughMore swiftly drive  Dull night thy sooty wheels come active morn  Then to the field Mardonius Conquer now  Deliberate hereafter on the spoil  But thou may'st perishperish and the gifts  Of fortune change to everlasting fame  A sudden trumpet strikes his ear he sees  Masistius nigh So breaks the polar star  Through night's unrav'ling canopy of clouds  On some bewilder'd sailor to correct  His erring course Amidst a warm embrace  Began Mardonius O in season come  Thou more than half myself my strength decays  My talents languish ev'n my honour sleeps  When thou art far Masistius calm replies  I have compos'd Pallene's late revolt  Through all the district Potidaea's walls  Alone resisted from whose small domain  O'erflow'd by tides the army I withdrew  I come Mardonius not to hear a tale  Of languid talents or of strength decay'd  Much less of honour sleeping in thy breast  When I am absent Honour on a rock  Immoveable is fix'd its solid base  The billowy passions beat in vain nor gusts  Of fortune shake support from none it wants  Firm in itself Some augury or dream  Inexplicably dark o'erclouds thy mind  Resume thy native manliness O chief  Whose loyal faith the mightiest king entrusts  With all his pow'r and splendour save the crown  Prepare to pass Thermopylae and bring  Our labours to decision Gobryas' son  Compares the language of his spotless friend  With his own devious thoughts and turns aside  In blushing silence but recover'd sends  His mandate forth to march by rising dawn  Not with a less commotion in his soul  From diff'rent cares Emathia's prince resorts  To Amarantha On her beauteous neck  In conjugal affection yet in grief  Unutterable long he hangs Alas  My lord she said though early I presag'd  Thy embassy abortive hath it prov'd  Disastrous Yes her agonizing spouse  Return'd what more disastrous than reproach  Among the old hereditary friends  Of my forefathers Amarantha lend  Attention amply shall my tongue relate  Events impress'd too deeply on my heart  I went to Athens Aristides call'd  Her various tribes the image of a god  Was he presiding Innocent at least  Intentionally guiltless I began  Good will to Athens prompted ev'ry word  Impow'r'd by Xerxes thus Mardonius greets  You men of Athens Repossess your soil  Enlarg'd dominion from the royal hand  Ask and obtain be govern'd by your laws  The son of Gobryas will rebuild your fanes  Accept the king's alliance and be free  With added strength and splendour Me receive  Illustrious people offspring of the soil  Which you inhabit Not a guest unknown  In Athens I your Macedonian host  Of warm unchang'd affection to your state  Salvation bring prosperity and peace  Reflect what numbers of subjected Greeks  Some ancient foes to Athens others friends  But now constrain'd with Xerxes are ally'd  The small remainder unsubdu'd consult  Their own defence Are Spartans in the field  Your produce indefatigable race  Your newbuilt mansions to a second waste  Of flames your wives your progeny they leave  To want and rapine Singly can you face  Half Greece all Asia leagu'd against your weal  Oh Amarantha frowns on ev'ry brow  Indignant lowr'd around me Present there  Was Aëmnestus from Laconia's state  He who unaw'd by Xerxes on his throne  Strange retribution claim'd and sternly chose  Mardonius' self the victim to appease  Leonidas Th' Athenians he address'd  "Invading Sardis to enlarge your sway  "Athenians you are authors of a war  "Which now extends to all of Grecian blood  "Ill would it then become you to desert  "The gen'ral cause To servitude resign'd  "By you a double shame the Greeks would cast  On Athens known of old and often prov'd  "By arms and counsel to redeem and guard  "The liberty of nations I condemn  "Like you my tardy countrymen will bleed  "Not less for you than Sparta Soon I trust  "She will arrange her phalanx on the field  "Else to your vengeance I devote my head  "Meantime your wives and offspring ev'ry state  "In love will cherish Attic ears be shut  "To this deceiver his condition calls  "On him to plead for tyranny himself  "Wields a despotic scepter petty lord  "Of feeble Macedon and Persia's slave"  Severe and awful Aristides rose  His manners still urbanity adorn'd  "Ambassador of Sparta" he began  "Us thou hast charg'd as authors of the war  "Yet dost extol our vigour in redress  "Of injur'd states Th' Ionians were enslav'd  "Our own descendants Sardis we assail'd  "To set them free nor less our present zeal  "For all of Grecian blood by common ties  "Of language manners customs rites and laws  "To us ally'd Can Sparta doubt our faith  "What disingenuous unbeseeming thought  "In her late witness of our lib'ral proof  "Of constancy when ev'ry clime on earth  "Was equal to Athenians where to chuse  "Their habitation true to Greece they stay'd  "In sight of Athens burning to attempt  "The dang'rous fight which Spartans would have "shunn'd  "Now from the ruins of paternal tombs  "Of altars fall'n and violated fanes  "Loud vengeance calls a voice our courage hears  "Enlarg'd to pious fury Spartan know  "If yet unknowing of the Attic race  "Not one to treat with Xerxes will survive  "Our wives and offspring shall encumber none  "All we require of Sparta is to march  "That ere th' expected foe invades our bounds  "The Greeks united on Boeotian plains  "May give him battleAlexander view  "That glorious pow'r which rolls above our heads  "He first his wonted orbit shall forsake  "Ere we our virtue Never more appear  "Before the presence of Cecropian tribes  "With embassies like this nor blind by zeal  "Howe'er sincere to Athens urge again  "What is beneath her majesty to bear  "I should be griev'd her anger should disgrace  "A prince distinguish'd as her host and friend  "Meantime I pity thy dependent state"  Loud acclamations hurried from the sight  Of that assembly thy dejected spouse  In his own thoughts dishonour'd What a lot  Is mine If Xerxes triumph I become  A slave in purple should the Greeks prevail  Should that Euboean conqueror the son  Of Neocles be sent th' Athenian scourge  Hear and take comfort interpos'd the queen  To thee I come for counsel sigh'd her lord  I will repose me on thy breast will hear  Thy voice hereafter ever will obey  Thy love thy charms can sooth my present cares  Thy wisdom ward the future She proceeds  That Greece will triumph rest assur'd no force  Of these untaught Barbarians can resist  Her policy and arms Awhile dear lord  We must submit to wear the galling mask  Necessity imposes New events  Are daily scatter'd by the restless palm  Of Fortune some will prove propitious Wise  To all men gracious Aristides serv'd  By us in season will befriend our state  This said her starlike beauty gilds his gloom  While round them heav'n his midnight curtain drops  By rising dawn th' Oetaean rocks and caves  Ring with ten thousand trumps and clarions loud  With all his host the son of Gobryas leaves  His empty'd camp So rushes from his den  The strong and thickfurr'd animal who boasts  Calisto's lineage bound in drowsy sloth  Bleak winter he exhausts when tepid spring  His limbs releases from benumbing cold  He reinstates his vigour and asserts  Among Sarmatian woods his wonted sway  The bands entire of Persians and of Medes  The rest selected from unnumber'd climes  Compose the army Forty myriads sweep  Thy pass renown'd Thermopylae to rush  On Grecian cities scatter'd in their view  So by the deep Borystenes in floods  Of frothy rage by mightier Danube's wave  Nor less by countless congregated streams  The Euxine swoln through Hellespontine straits  Impels his rapid current thence extends  Among th' Aegean isles a turbid maze  Three days the multitude requir'd to pass  The rough defile Masistius in the van  His sumptuous arms and allsurpassing form  Discovers Tiridates leads the rear  Clos'd by the troops of Macedon whose king  Sat on a car beside his radiant queen  Amid the center on a milkwhite steed  Mardonius rode in armour plated gold  Thick set with gems Before him march'd a guard  Of giant size from each Barbarian tribe  For huge dimension and terrific mien  Preferr'd Their captain from his stature nam'd  Briareus born on Rhodope display'd  That hundredhanded Titan on his shield  He swung around an ironstudded mace  In length ten cubits to his shoulders broad  The hairy spoils of hunted bears supply'd  A shaggy mantle his uncover'd head  Was bald except where nigh the brawny neck  Short bushy locks their crisped terrors knit  So his own mountain through surrounding woods  Lifts to the clouds a summit bare and smooth  In frost which glistens by no season thaw'd  Not such is gentle Mindarus behind  In argent mail Unceasing on his shield  Intent Cleora newly painted there  A living beauty but another's prize  He views while hopeless passion wastes the hue  Of his fair cheek and elegance of form  Not less th' unrivall'd Amarantha's eyes  Had pierc'd the son of Gobryas Instant sparks  On her appearance from Nicaea first  Had kindled warm desire which absence cool'd  While she in distant Macedon abode  When winter melted at the breath of spring  Her sight again amid th' assembling host  Reviv'd the fervour of an eastern breast  By nature prone by wanton licence us'd  To am'rous pleasures Public duty still  Employ'd his hours still smother'd was the flame  Nor on his wishes had occasion smil'd  Ev'n in the absence of Aemathia's prince  At Athens friendship's unremitted care  Still in Sandaucè's chamber held the queen  Sequester'd inaccessibly immur'd  Beside Masistius rode a youthful page  Of eastern lineage He in tend'rest years  Stol'n by perfidious traffickers in slaves  By Medon purchas'd to Melissa giv'n  By her was nam'd Statirus and retain'd  Among her holy servitors This youth  On her benign protector she bestow'd  Masistius priz'd her token of esteem  Beyond himself and daily bounty show'r'd  On young Statirus Near the Locrian vale  Advancing now the satrap thus began  O early train'd by sage Melissa's hand  Gift of her friendship and in merit dear  Nine months are fled Statirus since I bow'd  In docile reverence not unlike thy own  To her instruction All her words divine  In precept or narration from this breast  No time can blot I now perceive a lake  Which holds an island she hath oft describ'd  Where tombs are mould'ring under cypress shades  There she hath told me great Oïleus rests  O father of Melissa should my pow'r  To savage licence of invasion leave  Thy dust expos'd my progress were but small  In virtue's track Masistius would disgrace  Thy daughter's guidanceFly Statirus post  These my attendant vassals to protect  That sacred turf let each battalion pass  Ere ye rejoin me Uttering this he hears  The trumpet's evening signal to encamp  The sun is low not ent'ring yet the vale  Mardonius halts and summons to his tent  Thessalia's chieftain faithless Greek approv'd  The Persian's friend with him th' unwilling prince  Of Macedon to whom the gen'ral thus  To march by dawn your squadrons both prepare  Thou Larissaean Thorax in these tracts  My trusted guide with swift excursion reach  The Isthmus watch the Spartan motions there  Thou Alexander sweep the furthest bounds  Of Locris Doris Phocis all their youth  In arms collect ere thirty days elapse  I shall expect them on the plains of Thebes  He said The king and Thorax both retire  The morning shines they execute their charge  The host proceeds Once happy was the vale  Where Medon's father and his faithful swain  Now to illustrious Haliartus chang'd  Abode in peace No longer is retain'd  The verdant smoothness ridg'd by grating wheels  Of Libyan cars uptorn by pond'rous hoofs  Of trooping steeds and camels Not this day  Is festive such as Sparta's king enjoy'd  When lib'ral hospitality receiv'd  His guardian standard on the Oïlean turf  No jocund swain now modulates his pipe  To notes of welcome not a maiden decks  Her hair in flow'rs mute Philomel whose throat  Once tun'd her warble to Laconian flutes  Amid barbarian dissonance repines  Now in rude march th' innumerable host  Approach the fountain whose translucent rills  In murmur lull the passenger's repose  On beds of moss in that refreshing cell  To rural peace constructed by the friend  Of man Oïleus Thither to evade  The noontide heat the son of Gobryas turns  Briareus captain of his giant guard  Accosts him ent'ring Image of the king  A list'ning ear to me thy servant lend  Thou goest to Thebes far diff'rent is the track  To Delphi Shall that receptacle proud  Of Grecian treasure heap'd from earliest times  Yet rest unspoil'd An earthquake not the arms  Of feeble Delphians foil'd the first attempt  Not twice Parnassus will disjoint his frame  Let me the precious enterprize resume  Who neither dread the mountain nor the god  Though not assenting yet without reproof  Mardonius looks postponing his reply  Hence soon the rumour of a new attempt  Against the Pythian oracle the seat  Of Amarantha's birth alarms her soul  Massistius born to virtue and refin'd  By frequent converse with Melissa pure  The queen consults Her instant he conveys  Before his friend to deprecate an act  Of sacrilege so fatal once The cell  She enters Like Anchises when his flock  On Ida's mount was folded at the sight  Of Venus breaking on his midnight hut  In all the radiance of celestial charms  Mardonius stands and fixes on the queen  An eye transported At a sign his friend  Withdrew but waited nigh To her the chief  What fortune brings the fairest of her sex  To her adoring servant She replies  False sure the rumour which pervades thy camp  A second time to violate the shrine  Of Phoebus once provok'd and sorely felt  Thou canst not mean The eager Persian then  Admit th' intent thy interceding voice  Protects Apollo Not on my request  Avoid an impious action firm she spake  Weigh thy own danger in offending heav'n  By piety and mercy win its grace  No all the merit shall be thine he cried  The favour due from heav'n be all thy own  I ask no more than Amarantha's smile  For my reward as Phoebus is thy god  Thou art my goddess Let me worship thus  He stopp'd and seiz'd her hand with am'rous lips  To stain those lilied beauties which surpass'd  Junonian whiteness Virtue from her eyes  Flash'd and with crimson indignation dy'd  Her cheeks Retire forget not who I am  Stern she rebuk'd him He accustom'd long  To yielding beauty in the wanton East  That torrid clime of love a stranger he  To elegance of coyness in the sex  Much more to chaste repulse when ev'ry bar  But honour warm occasion hath remov'd  These words austerely utter'd Am I chang'd  No more Mardonius Is my dazzling sun  Of pow'r and splendour suddenly obscur'd  In state degraded for a peasant's garb  Have I exchang'd my purple Is my prime  My form in all th' impurities of age  By some malignant talisman disguis'd  At once grown loathsome Who and what I am  Thou prodigy of coldness and disdain  Remind me Who and what thou art she said  I will remind thee to confound thee more  No characters of magic have the pow'r  To change a noble and ingenuous mind  Thou hast thyself degraded thou hast rent  The wreaths which circle thy commanding brow  And all their splendour wantonly defac'd  Thy rank and pow'r exalted dost thou hold  From partial heav'n to violate the laws  Of men and gods True pattern to the world  Of Persian virtues Now to all thy pomp  Thy steeds thy chariots and emblazing gems  The gorgeous pageants of tyrannic state  I leave thee son of luxury and vice  She said and darted like a meteor swift  Away whose aspect red presages woe  To superstition's herd The Persian's pride  Is wounded tapers to the cell he calls  By them a tablet unobserv'd before  Attracts his gloomy eye The words were these  "The Spartan king a visitant was here  "Who by a tyrant's multitude o'erpow'r'd  "Died for his country Be accurst the man  "The man impure who violates these walls  "Which by Oïleus hospitably rais'd  "Receiv'd the great Leonidas a guest  "Oïlean Medon this inscription trac'd"  Another hangs beneath it in this strain  "Laconian Aëmnestus rested here  "From Asia's camp return'd His faulchion's point  "To deities and mortals thus proclaims  "His arm to vengeance on Mardonius pledg'd  "The king of Sparta's manes to appease"  Brave was the son of Gobryas like the god  Of war in battle yet a dream an act  Of froward chance would oft depress his mind  He recollects with pain the challenge bold  From that severe Laconian in the tent  Of Xerxes this to Amarantha's scorn  Succeeding throws new darkness o'er his gloom  Masistius ent'ring hasty thus began  What hast thou done Mardonius When I led  This princess back indignant she complain'd  Of wrong from thee Thy countenance is griev'd  Confus'd Mardonius pointed to the scrolls  Masistius read he took the word again  Now in the name of Horomazes chief  Art thou discourag'd by a Grecian vaunt  Or by that empty oracle which claim'd  Atonement for Leonidas Despise  Mysterious words and omens like a man  But if thou bear'st the conscience of a deed  Unworthy just thy sorrow like a man  Feel due contrition and the fault repair  I have meant wrong not acted said the chief  Greece once produc'd a Helen who forsook  A throne and husband what these later dames  Call honour which without an eunuch guard  Protects their charms in Asia is unknown  Resentful gall'd at first I now admire  This lofty woman who like Helen bright  Rejected me a lover who surpass  The son of Priam Thou art gentler far  Than I discreet Masistius sooth by morn  With lenient words and costly gifts her ire  Call Mindarus together let us feast  He too is gentle I am rough and hot  Whom thou canst guide Masistius thou alone  Soon Mindarus appears in aspect sad  Soon is the royal equipage produc'd  Which Xerxes gave Mardonius to sustain  His delegated state Ye rustic pow'rs  Ye Dryads Oreads of th' Oïlean seat  Ye Naiads white of lucid brooks and founts  Had you existence other than in tales  Of fancy how had your astonish'd eyes  At piles of gold enrich'd by orient gems  Been dimm'd with lustre Genius of the cell  Simplicity had fram'd to rural peace  How hadst thou started at a Persian board  Fair female minstrels charm the sight and ear  Effeminating measures on their lutes  Dissolve the soul in languor which admits  No thought but love Their voices chance directs  To sing of Daphnè by Apollo chas'd  Of him inflam'd at beauties in her flight  Disclos'd him reaching with a vain embrace  Those virgin beauties into laurel chang'd  On flowrybank'd Orontes Syrian stream  Mardonius sighs at disappointed love  Tears down the cheeks of Mindarus descend  Recalling dear Cleora not as dead  Recall'd but living in another's arms  Not so the firmness of Masistius yields  The soft lascivious theme his thoughts reject  By pure affections govern'd Yet the charm  Of harmony prevailing serves to raise  Compos'd remembrance of Melissa's lyre  Which oft in stillness of a moonlight hour  Amid her nymphs in symphony highton'd  To moderation equity and faith  To deeds heroic and humane she struck  With force divine reproving lawless will  Intemp'rate paffions turpitude of mind  And savage manners in her ethic lay  The banquet ends and all depart to rest  End of the Twentyfirst Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the TWENTYSECOND  BY morn return'd Masistius Hear he said  Th' event unpleasing from thy passion sprung  Mardonius thy temerity hath chac'd  From Persia's camp the Macedonian queen  I found her tent abandon'd but her course  Conjecture cannot trace What other style  Than of Barbarians can the Greeks afford  To us of Asia Lo a youthful king  Our best ally and my distinguish'd friend  Exerts a distant effort in our cause  Meantime the honour of his queen by all  Ador'd inviolate till now our chief  Insults by station her protector sole  When I am absent Not thyself alone  Thou hast disgrac'd but me her guardian pledg'd  By sacred oaths to Macedonia's lord  These words evincing nature's purest gifts  Deserving that society sublime  With Grecian muses where Melissa pour'd  Her moral strain in perturbation plunge  The hearer when importunate abrupt  Appears Briareus and renews the suit  To pillage Delphi No in wrath replied  The clouded son of Gobryas bring my steed  March all to Thebes Then humble as a child  Who to parental castigation owns  His fault in tears Masistius he address'd  How bless'd the mind by Horomazes fram'd  Like thine serene Masistius to resist  Unruly passions never warm desires  Pride or ambition vex thy equal thoughts  Which from their level no dejection low'rs  Yet none surpasses thee in rank and pow'r  Among the satraps Uncorrupted man  O in thyself superior to thy state  Me who so often sink below my own  Befriend in this dark moment I foresee  I feel disaster in this harsh event  Masistius here Reflect thou mighty chief  At either gate of life the first and last  Yet more through all their intermediate space  Vicissitude and hazard lurk unseen  Supplanting wary steps To mortal pow'r  Those dreadful ministers of jealous heav'n  The elements are hostile and to low'r  The great with changing fortune oft conspire  Her cruel sport Mardonius need we tempt  With our own follies In thy arduous post  Thy hand sustains a balance where the lives  Of nations where an empire's fate is pois'd  From hour to hour against the common ills  Of chance and nature which so often foil  The wifest do not superadd the weight  Of thy own passions to the adverse scale  I who am ever to thy virtues just  Will not be slow though grieving at thy faults  To furnish present help Farewell I mount  My swiftest courser to o'ertake the queen  Whose indignation I can best compose  Mardonius then Adventure is a chace  Thy virtue no idolatress of fame  Enjoys thy prompters are the love of right  Care for a friend or zeal for Persia's state  Which render hazardous attempts thy bliss  Sublime Masistius Thou hast weight to awe  Mardonius who thy enterprising hand  Laments but never to controul assumes  Yet feels and most regrets his own defects  Whene'er they cause thy absence Here they end  Discourse Of cavalry a num'rous pow'r  Train'd by himself Masistius heads and leaves  The army filing tow'rds Boeotian fields  He bends his course to Delphi he attains  Permessus round the Heliconian heights  In argent mazes whisp'ring as he flows  To passengers along the winding way  Which skirts the mountain and o'erlooks the stream  Back from the ford the satrap's courser starts  Affrighted Lo to crimson as of blood  In sudden change the late crystalline wave  Melodious solace of the sacred nine  Rolls horrible to view Anon with helms  With spears and bucklers grating o'er the bed  Of loosen'd stone with limbs and trunks of men  The turbid current chafes Masistius spurs  Through all obstruction in his forc'd career  The clank of armour crash of spears and shouts  Of battle strike his ear the vocal rocks  Augment the animating sound he sees  A flying soldier by his target known  A Macedonian guard who stops and thus  Hail satrap hail thou timely sent by heav'n  Haste and protect the Macedonian queen  A host of robbers by the lawless times  Combin'd have vanquish'd our inferior force  Part of our mangled number choak that flood  Part on the ground lie bleeding At these words  Masistius rushes with his pond'rous lance  In rest Emathia's beauteous queen in flight  Before pursuing ruffians he perceives  On her fleet courser Thunderbolt of strength  He hurls to earth their leader giantsiz'd  A profligate deserter from the guard  Mardonian Next a Phocian born expell'd  His native residence for crimes he flew  The active staff is broken in the chest  Of an Arcadian branded by his state  With infamy the victor then unsheaths  His sabre op'ning through the savage rout  A passage wide for death His faithful train  Surround them irresistible he sweeps  The traitors headlong to the flood below  Which foams like Simois by Pelides swoln  With Trojan dead and struggling to discharge  Th' unwonted load in Neptune's briny waste  The conqueror dismounts before the queen  His gracious form presenting in the arms  Of his sustaining friends he sudden sinks  Oppress'd by wounds unheeded ev'n unfelt  Amid the warmth of action Then her veil  She rends asunder and lamenting beats  Her grateful breast The notes of sorrow loud  Through all the concourse dissipate his trance  Serene these words he utters Honour's track  Is perilous though lovely there to walk  Not fearing death nor coveting his stroke  Though to receive it ever well prepar'd  Has been my choice and study But fair queen  Be not discourag'd at my present state  Wounds are to me familiar and their cures  To Delphi lead me or whatever place  Thy wish prefers Masistius comes thy guard  So will continue and ere long restor'd  Hath much for thy instruction to impart  While these to Delphi on his march to Thebes  Advanc'd the son of Gobryas Soon the steps  Innumerous of men and coursers bruise  On green Cephissian meads the growth of May  Copaeae's lake perfum'd with orange groves  Which rude unsated violence deforms  The multitudes envelop thence along  The sedgy borders of Ismenus reach  Cadmēan walls when now the golden sun  Sev'n times had fill'd his orbit Thebes admits  The Persian gen'ral in these words address'd  By Leontiades Thrice welcome lord  We thy allies our counsel to disclose  Have waited long Not hazarding a fight  Thou hast the means to ascertain success  Here seated tranquil from exhaustless stores  Distribute gold among the Grecian states  Corrupt the pow'rful open faction's mouth  Divide nor doubt to overcome that strength  Which link'd in union will surmount the force  Of all mankind The ardent Persian here  To court th' Athenians with a lavish hand  Have I not stoop'd already but disdain'd  That haughty race to destiny I leave  Have I not bid defiance to their boast  Themistocles Him forfeiting his word  Pledg'd to confront me on Boeotian plains  I haste to summon at his native gates  What are the Greeks if Athens be reduc'd  Where are the vaunted Spartans lock'd in fear  Behind their isthmian wall by heav'n in fear  Of Thorax ranging with a slender band  Of his Thessalian horse Thou rule in Thebes  Brave Mindarus till I from Athens tam'd  Return with fetters for the rest of Greece  He seeks his couch and after short repose  By twilight bursts like thunder from a cloud  Which on Olympus hov'ring black contains  The livid store of Jove's collected wrath  Against offending mortals O'er a land  Deserted silent to the empty roofs  Of Athens was the march Mardonius climb'd  Aegaleos thence on Salamis descry'd  That muchenduring people who again  For liberty forsook their native homes  On his approach His gen'rous pride relents  He wishes such a nation were a friend  His wishes waken in his breast an awe  At such a foe Murichides was nigh  A Hellespontine Grecian of his train  Nor in his favour low to him he spake  Look on that haughty but that gallant race  Perhaps at me by myriads thus begirt  Their very children lift their little hands  In menaces and cursing lisp the names  Of Xerxes and Mardonius Mount a bark  Pass with a herald to that crowded isle  The senators accost the people shun  In pride beyond nobility repeat  The words Aemathian Alexander us'd  "Ye men of Athens repossess your homes  "Enlarg'd dominion from the royal hand  "Ask and obtain be govern'd by your laws  "The son of Gobryas will rebuild your fanes  "Accept the king's alliance and be free  "With added strength and splendour" Further say  They little know what confidence is due  To him who sends thee Asian Greeks subdu'd  By me retain their democratic rights  On Salamis the Hellespontine lands  Before th' Athenian senate he displays  The Persian proffer All indignant hear  But Lycides who thus exhorting spake  From Athens twice expell'd deserted twice  By Lacedaemon who her toil employs  Still on her isthmian fence who lifts no shield  To guard our wives and progeny to save  From desolation our defenceless fields  Or from our homes repel the hostile blaze  What can we better injur'd and betray'd  Than listen to Mardonius be referr'd  His terms of friendship to th' assembling tribes  The universal senate rose in scorn  Of such submission By the people known  His counsel rous'd enthusiastic rage  Nor Aristides can the tumult cool  They stone the timid senator to death  The women catch the spirit fierce as fair  Laodice collects th' infuriate sex  They hand in hand a dreadful circle form  Around his mansion and his wife and race  Doom to perdition that his coward blood  May ne'er survive in Greece Enormous thought  Perhaps not less than such excess of zeal  Excess of peril in that season claim'd  To save a land which foster'd ev'ry muse  That eloquence philosophy and arts  Might shine in Attic purity of light  To latest ages but a sudden fleet  In wide array extending on the shore  Suspends the deed Before each wond'ring eye  Timothea lands Sicinus at her side  When thus the matron to th' impatient throng  His native friends Themistocles salutes  Euboean plenty in your present need  He sends Returning I this crouded isle  Will disencumber and to safety bear  Your wives and infants open to their wants  Eudora holds her Amarynthian seat  Elephenor Tisander to the shrines  Of Jove invite them and to friendly roofs  Euboea's towns As oft Aurora sheds  Serenity around her when the gates  Of light first open to her fragrant step  Hush'd at her feet lies Boreas who had rent  The dusky pall of night and Jove restrains  The thunder's roar and torrents of the skies  Such was Timothea's presence so the storm  By furies late excited at her voice  Was tame She learns the melancholy fate  Of Lycides to her protection takes  His helpless orphans and disastrous wife  Now of its plenteous stores while eager hands  The num'rous fleet unlade and Attic dames  Prepare with good Timothea to embark  Just Aristides first of men conducts  That first of matrons to his joyful tent  Where she began O righteous like the gods  Now hear my whole commission and believe  Themistocles my husband feels thy worth  When at his summons on Euboea's coast  I landed first "Thrice welcome" he exclaim'd  "From Athens hither to a safe abode  "A second emigration I presage  "To her afflicted race" From port to port  Around Euboea's populous extent  With him convey'd I saw her wealthy towns  To his controul subordinate Their pow'rs  He now is gath'ring some achievement new  He meditates which secresy conceals  Like fate's dark roll inscrutable to all  From thee an early notice he requests  Soon as the Greeks united in one camp  The sole attention of Mardonius draw  Th' intelligence to bring I leave behind  That faithful man Sicinus Virtuous dame  Wise is thy husband Aristides spake  From him no other than achievements high  However my conjecture they surpass  I still expect Themistocles apprise  That I am bound for Sparta to upbraid  Pausanias proud and summon to the field  That selfish breed so martial yet so cold  To public welfare Let me next prefer  To thy benignity a fervent suit  He straight withdrew and reappearing led  Two little damsels humble in attire  Behold my daughters he resum'd admit  These to thy care now motherless they want  Protection ev'n Euphemia they have lost  My venerable parent have the gods  Releas'd but newly from the growing scene  Of trouble Athens must a parent prove  To these hereafter fated to receive  No portion from a father who delights  In poverty His arms are all the wealth  Of Aristides With a tender hand  She takes the children O of men she said  Most rich whose wealth is virtue in the name  Of household gods this office I accept  O Aristides these shall mix with mine  These shall contribute to cement the work  I long have wrought the amity begun  Betwixt Themistocles and thee In tears  Depart the infant maidens from a sire  Of gentlest nature and in manners bland  Not less than just Meanwhile to Athens steers  Murichides unharm'd The rising dawn  Sees with her precious charge Timothea sail  Lo from the city clouds of smoke ascend  Voluminous with interlacing flames  Such as Vesuvius vomits from his gulph  Sulphureous when unquenchable the heat  Within his concave melts the surging ore  To floods of fire Murichides had told  His fruitless embassy Mardonius wild  With ire to instant conflagration doom'd  Th' abode of such inexorable foes  They on the margin opposite beheld  Their ancient residence a second time  Destroy'd nor utter'd more than just complaint  Of tardy Sparta When Briareus dire  With his gigantic savages o'erturn'd  The recent tomb which held the glorious slain  At Salamis when scatter'd in the wind  They saw that dust rever'd in solemn rage  Devoid of sound illiberal or loud  Each his right hand with sanctity of oaths  Pledg'd to his neighbour and to vengeance full  His blood devoted Aristides look'd  As some incens'd divinity and spake  Persist ye sons of folly crush that tomb  The last repose of yon heroic slain  Disturb therein exhibiting your doom  From mortals and immortals Thus your pride  By heav'n and Grecian valour shall be crush'd  Your impious host be scatter'd like that dust  Which your barbarity profanes Now friends  By your appointment I to Sparta sail  You under watchful discipline remain  Compos'd and firm such patience will surmount  All obstacle Athenians will restore  In brighter glories your paternal seats  This said the isle he leaves selecting none  But Cimon for associate In the bark  Him Aristides placidly bespake  Son of Miltiades the great in arms  Thy early youth was dissolute thy look  Ingenuous still and frank thy tongue reveal'd  Internal virtue friendship on my part  Succeeded thence a study to reclaim  Thy human frailties I rejoice in hope  Thou wilt hereafter prove an Attic star  In council wise triumphant in the field  Humane to strangers to thy country just  Friend to her laws to all her Muses kind  Who may record thy actions Cimon here  If I have virtues they proceed from thee  If I attain to glory I shall owe  To thee my lustre To deserve thy praise  What have I yet accomplish'd I have fought  At Salamis what more performing there  Than each Athenian Aristides then  True all were brave my judgment doth not rest  On one exploit thy modesty o'erlooks  The signs of worth and talents whence my hopes  Have rank'd thee first of Grecians To acquire  To keep that station Cimon be thy choice  Thou hast the means but this impression hold  Who would excel must be a moral man  Thus they exhaust their voyage of a day  When at Troezenè they arrive and find  Renown'd Cleander training for the field  His native bands To Sparta thence they sail  The Ephori assemble when they hear  Of Aristides who an audience claims  He comes before them and austerely thus  Cecropia's race exterminated twice  Demand of Sparta whether sloth or fear  Or Persian gold her buckler hath unbrac'd  Mardonius proffer'd more than equal terms  Not friendship singly but enlarg'd domain  To Athens who to eleutherian Jove  To Greece was faithful and the lib'ral gift  Disdain'd Your own ambassador pronounc'd  Your phalanx ready for its speedy march  His head he pledg'd Mardonius takes the field  He lays th' Athenian territory waste  Where are the Spartans Adding work to work  For their own sep'rate safety at their wall  Inglorious isthmian wall while half the Greeks  Become your foes and Athens is betray'd  Pausanias present proudly thus replied  Hast thou not heard the Hyacinthian rites  Employ the Spartans shall the heads of Greece  Be question'd be directed when to act  By you Athenians your inferior state  May wait our leisure Aristides here  Talk'st thou to me of Hyacinthian games  While rude Barbarians riot in our fields  While Athens burns while sacrilege invades  Our temples while our ancestors we see  Torn from the grave Pausanias thou disgrace  To thy forefather Hercules whose arm  To friends a bulwark was a scourge to foes  What hast thou said But guardian to the son  Of that renown'd Leonidas who fought  Beyond the isthmus and for Greece expir'd  If thou retain'st no rev'rence for his blood  If thou dost scorn Lycurgus and his laws  If holding liberty an empty name  Art now in treaty with a lawless king  No more of words Athenians have their choice  To treat with Xerxes or to distant climes  Expand the sail resigning to their fate  Unfaithful timid Grecians who have lost  All claim to succourYet assume your swords  My love for Greece solicits you in tears  Be thou Pausanias general of all  We in that noble warfare will refuse  No hardshipEv'n thy arrogant command  I like the meanest soldier will abide  Then Aëmnestus brief O righteous man  I feel thy wrongs Laconia's shame I feel  Which if delay still blackens thou shalt lead  Me the due victim of Athenian wrath  Before those injur'd tribes by me deceiv'd  Where my own sword shall sacrifice the blood  I pledg'd for Sparta's faith Meantime withdraw  I was thy guest in Athens thou be mine  Not till the dayspring Aëmnestus greets  His Attic friend Our citizens are march'd  All night my indefatigable toil  Hath urg'd the phalanx on the various states  Within the isthmus will obey our call  Now speed with me o'ertake inspect our host  They both depart with Cimon Sparta's camp  Ere Phoebus couches Aristides gains  The marshall'd pupils of Lycurgus there  He ever true to equity applauds  Who their disgraceful sloth in council blam'd  Subordination silent order held  Each in his place in look as virgins meek  Sedate they listen'd to their chiefs as youth  To learning's voice in academic schools  Thus in some fertile garden wellmanur'd  The regularity of plants and trees  Enrich'd with produce on a stable root  Stands permanent by skilful care dispos'd  At first and sedulously wateh'd No vaunt  Offends the ear nor supercilious frown  Of confidence the eye Th' Athenian chief  Content returns on Salamis receiv'd  Cecropia's bands he marshals for the

Cadmean plains  The Persian trump shall sound Cithaeron's hill  Asopian banks shall soon repeat the notes  Triumphal Swift he rushes back to Thebes  Ere Phoebus darted his solstitial heat  As some hot courser who from pasture led  Replete with food and courage spurns the ground  In confidence and pride no sooner meets  His wonted rider than admits the rein  Such was Mardonius when from Theban gates  Masistius thus address'd him Be inform'd  That Macedonia's sov'reign is arriv'd  With his fair consort Her to Delphi's walls  I guarded there deliver'd to her lord  Who hath conducted fifty thousand Greeks  In arms auxiliar to thy camp The queen  Now at a fabric old to Dircè built  Close by her fountain and beset with shade  Dwells in retreat which careful thou avoid  But tell me son of Gobryas whither flown  Was all thy magnanimity when flames  A second time laid stately Athens low  Though disappointed couldst thou deem a crime  Her constancy refusing to betray  A common cause Mardonius thou dost hope  To conquer why a city of renown  Which in her beauty would have grac'd our sway  Hast thou reduc'd to ashes Oh reflect  What fires of stern resistance and revenge  This act hath lighted in such gallant hearts  That pow'r eternal by the hallow'd name  Of Horomazes worshipp'd in our clime  Who earth and seas and firmament controuls  With all therein looks down not less on Greece  Than Persia both his creatures Just and wise  Intemp'rate deeds in either he resents  Mardonius answer'd By that pow'r I swear  Thou to a Grecian almost art transform'd  By intercourse with yon religious hill  Of thy admir'd Melissa Do I blame  Ah no too awful art thou to incur  My censure O Masistius I confess  Thy genius purer more sublime than mine  I often err thou neverBut dear friend  I am dejected ever when thou chid'st  Yet thee my chiding monitor should fate  Snatch from Mardonius he would rise no more  I only seek to warn thee not deject  Rejoins Masistius turn to other

wide encampment on the right  Was form'd sedate and silent was the toil  As is the concourse of industrious ants  In mute attention to their public cares  Extending thence successive states erect  Their standards On the left their num'rous tents  Th' Athenians pitch In labour not unlike  The buzzing tenants of sonorous hives  Loquacious they and lively cheer the field  Yet regularly heed each signal giv'n  By staid commanders Underneath a fringe  Of wood projecting from Cithaeron's side  Ascends the chief pavilion Seated there  Is Aristides at a frugal board  An aged menial his attendant

Greece is center'd in this host  Which if we hazard lightly were a crime  Th' offended gods with fetters would chastise  Our Attic flame to sudden onset points  By me discourag'd Aemnestus then  Know that with me Callicrates unites  Farewell thy wisdom shall direct us both  The sun was set th' unnumber'd eyes of heav'n  Thin clouds envelop'd dusky was the veil  Of night not sable placid was the air  The lowton'd current of Asopus held  No other motion than his native flow  Alluring Aristides in a walk  Contemplative to pace the stable verge  Attir'd in moss The hostile camp he views  Which by Masistian vigilance and art  With walls of wood and turrets was secur'd  For this the groves of Jupiter supreme  On Hypatus were spoil'd Teumessian brows  Mesabius Parnes were uncover'd all  Square was th' inclosure ev'ry face emblaz'd  With order'd lights Each elevated tent  Of princely satraps and surmounting all  Mardonius thine from coronets of lamps  Shot lustre soft'ning on the distant

hosts  Or keep thy silver wave from blood unstain'd  Lord of Olympus didst thou want the pow'r  Or boundless pow'r possessing want the will  Thy own created system to secure  From such destruction Wherefore on this plain  Is Europe thus and adverse Asia met  For human carnage Natural this search  Yet but a waste of reason Let me shun  Unprofitable wand'rings o'er the land  Obscure of trackless mystery to see  The path of virtue open is enough  Whate'er the cause of evil he who knows  Himself not partner in that cause attains  Enough of knowledge all the rest is dream  Of falselystyl'd

faithful to the son  Of Neocles thy own observing eye  Will prompt thy tongue this notice sole I send  We will not hurry to a gen'ral fight  Bless in my name Timothea bless her sons  Her daughters nor

precious life  Be hazarded let others take the charge  Briareus Midias Tiridates brave  Or Mindarus a thousand leaders bold  This host affords Masistius in the gloom  Of midnight from my pillow I discern'd  Thy gracious figure on a steed of fire  Who bore thee up to heav'n where sudden folds  Of radiant vapour wrapp'd thee from my view  At once throughout th' innumerable tents  Their hue was chang'd to black Boeotia's hills  And caves with ejulation from the camp  Rebellow'd round the camels horses mules  Dissolv'd in tears Let Mithra's angry beam  Pierce this right arm annihilate my strength  And melt my courage I will rest content  To purchase thus the safety of my friend  Masistius answer'd Son of Gobryas learn  That he who makes familiar to his mind  The certainty of death and nobly dares  In virtue's clear pursuit may look serene  On boding dreams and auguries averse  No sign but honour he requires he wants  No monitor but duty An attempt  My observation hath maturely weigh'd  Belongs to me to others less inform'd  I will not leave the danger Quick replies  Disturb'd Mardonius while at friendship's warmth  Ambition melts and honour fills his breast  O worthier far

level of thy worth with me  With others soar'st too high What means the word  Temptation what this danger to the king  O satrap listed by his grace so high  Thou hast o'erwhelm'd Masistius May the God  Of truth and justice strengthen in thy soul  The light ingenuous which so much reveals  That sense of duty may suppress a thought  I dare not clothe in language Still in mind  The parting words of Artemisia bear  Which in its blameless moments oft thy tongue  Repeats with admiration "Look" she said  "Look only where no mystery can lurk  "On ev'ry manly duty Nothing dark  "O'ershades the track of virtue plain her path  "But superstition chosen for a guide  "Misleads the best and wisest" Let me add  Worse is the guide ambition which misleads  To more than error to atrocious acts  I shall despair Masistius if thou fall'st  Rejoins Mardonius Must Masistius then  Consort with women shut from noble deeds  Subjoins the virtuous Persian Can thy hand  Thy friendly hand now rivetted in mine  Of my degree and dignity of birth  Deprive me or obliterate the name  With all its lustre which my fathers left  Me to uphold Or wouldst thou if impow'r'd  Taint my firm spirit with an eunuch's fear  Among their feeble train my rank confine  My strength unnerve my fortitude debase  While these subsist with titles wealth and state  While as I pass the crouding myriads shout  Here comes Masistius what is less requir'd  From him than deeds to manifest a soul  Which merits such distinction We again  This day will meet Mardoniusbut as none  Of human texture can the flight foresee  Of that inevitable dart which soon  Or late will strike I leave these words behind  If blinded still by superstition's cloud  Thou wilt believe me in this hour the mark  Of fate retain them as my dying words  Ambition curb let virtue be thy pride  They separated sad Mardonius still  Foreboding evil to his noble friend  He at the frailty of Mardonius griev'd  Masistius soon collecting round his tent  The

your gen'ral I rely  On your known prowess and I trust the hand  Of Horomazes will conduct you back  Victorious but remember that the brave  In life or death accomplishing their part  Are happy All rejoicing in a chief  Belov'd his orders sedulous fulfil  In arms more splendid than for Peleus' son  Th' immortal artist forg'd Masistius cas'd  His limbs of beauteous frame and manly grace  To match that hero whom Scamander saw  With Dardan blood imbru'd In hue of snow  His horse of all Nisaea's breed the choice  Caparison'd in rubies champs the gold  Which rules his mouth his animated mane  Floats o'er the bridle form'd of golden braid  His page was nigh that youth of eastern race  Whom for his merit pure Melissa gave  To this benignant satrap To ascend  His gorgeous seat preparing thus

purest thoughts  Exalted I my friendship will prolong  In gratitude and rev'rence blessing heav'n  Which thus prefers Masistius to extend  Benevolence to virtue If I fall  Resume with her the happiest

supine  Against him rush th' Athenians on his feet  They find him brandishing his sabre keen  With his firm shield a bulwark to his breast  Like one of those earthsprung in radiant arms  Whom the Cadmēan dragon's fruitful jaws  Or Colchian serpent's teeth produc'd Assail'd  On ev'ry side his fortitude augments  With danger Down to Pluto's realm he sends  Iphicrates and Eurytus who drank  Callirrhoe's fountain Amynander born  On smooth Ilissus and three gallant youths  Of Marathon His cuirass strong withstands  Repeated blows unwounded but o'ercome  By unremitted labour on his knees  Like some proud structure half o'erthrown by time  He sinks at last Brave Cimon hastes to save  A foe so noble in his deeds in port  Beyond a mortal when a vulgar sword  That moment through the vizor of his helm  Transfix'd the brain so exquisitely form'd  The seat of purest sentiment and thought  His frame in ruin beauteous still and great  The fatal stroke laid low An earthquake thus  Shook from his base that wonder of the world  The Colossean deity of Rhodes  Of danger all unheeding by his lord  Statirus kneel'd and o'er his bosom spread  His palms in anguish Timely to protect  The gentle youth ingenuous Cimon came  While thus the gasping satrap breath'd his last  Farewell thou faithfulBid Mardonius think  How brief are life's enjoymentsVirtue lives  Through all eternityBy virtue earn'd  Praise too is longMelissagrant me thine  In death resembling sweetest sleep his eyes  Serenely drop their curtains and the soul  Flies to th' eternal mansions of the just  Within the trenches Cimon straight commands  To lodge the corse when lo another cloud  Of Eastern squadrons Mindarus their chief  Who o'er the stream detach'd with numbers new  Not finding great Masistius rous'd afresh  The storm of onset Dreadful was the shock  Of these attempting to redeem of those  Who held the body but the Attic spears  Break in the chests of fiery steeds which press  With violence unyielding and the ranks  In front disarm The archers have discharg'd  Their quivers Now had Mindarus acquir'd  Undying glory and the Greeks resign'd  The longcontested prize when threat'ning shouts  Of diff'rent Grecians pouring from the camp  Alarm the eastern chief Cleander here  With all Troezenè Arimnestus there  Diomedon's bold successor in arms  With his Plataeans and the Thespian brave  Alcimedon assail the Persian flanks  So two hoarse torrents opposite descend  From hills where recent thunderstorms have burst  In the midvale the dashing waters meet  To overwhelm the peasant's hopes and toil  Myronides and Aeschylus in sight  Each with his formidable phalanx moves  Th' encampment whole is arming From the fight  His mangled cavalry the Persian calls  In eager quest of refuge in their lines  Beyond Asopus through surrounding foes  The coursers vault like swimmers who forsake  A found'ring vessel and with buoyant strength  Bound through the surge for safety on the beach  Triumphant in their camp the Greeks replace  Their standards thither Cimon's gen'rous care  Transports Masistius Eager to behold  A prize so noble curious throngs on throngs  Press in disorder each his station leaves  Confusion reigns The gen'ral host to arms  Pausanias sternly vigilant commands  And next provides a chariot to display  Throughout th' extensive lines th' illustrious dead  In magnitude and beauty late the pride  Of nature's study'd workmanship His limbs  The hand of Cimon tenderly compos'd  As would a brother to a brother's corse  Masistius fill'd the chariot on his knees  Statirus held and water'd with his tears  The face majestic not by death deform'd  Pale but with features mild which still retain'd  Attractive sweetness to endear the sight  First on the right through Lacedaemon's range  The spectacle is carried silence there  Prevails the Spartan citizen no sign  Of triumph shews subordinate to law  Which disciplin'd his passions Tow'rds the left  Through exultation loud of other Greeks  The awful car at length to Attic ranks  Brings their own prize by Aristides met  There silence too in rev'rence of their chief  Is universal He prepares to speak  But first the mighty reliques he surveys  He feels like Jove contemplating the pure  The gen'rous brave Sarpedon as he lay  In death's cold arms when swift th' almighty sire  Decreed that Morpheus gentlest of the gods  Should waft to Lycia's realm the royal clay  From pious friends and subjects to obtain  The rites of splendid sepulture Complete  Was now the solemn pause to list'ning ears  Thus Aristides vents his godlike soul  Here close your triumph Grecians nor provoke  The jealous pow'rs who mark for chosen wrath  O'erweening pride Though auguring success  From this great satrap's fall revere his clay  Such rev'rence all of mortal mold will need  All soon or late If comeliness and strength  If gracious manners and a mind humane  If worth and wisdom could avoid the grave  You had not seen this tow'r of Asia fall  Yet there is left attainable by man  What may survive the grave it is the fame  Of gen'rous actions this do you attain  I in Psittalia's isle this Persian knew  Brave Medon's prize his captive hands we freed  To him our hospitable faith we pledg'd  Through whom Phoebean Timon was redeem'd  With Haliartus on Euboea's fields  To signalize their swords On Oeta's hill  In him the daughter of Oïleus found  A spotless guardian Let his corse and arms  Thy acquisition Cimon be resign'd  To piety a herald shall attend  Thy steps remove him to his native friends  Let Xerxes hear let fierce Mardonius see  How much Barbarians differ from the Greeks  Minerva's tribes approving hear the words  Of clemency and pity Cimon mounts  The fun'ral car attentive and compos'd  Like Maia's son commission'd from the skies  By his eternal sire the warrior hears  The full instructions of his patron chief  Th' Asopian stream he fords to Asia's tents  Whence issue wailing multitudes who rend  The air with ejulation while the wheels  Before Mardonius stop their solemn roll  He rives his mantle and defiles with dust  His splendid head Not more the destin'd king  Of Judah mourn'd the virtuous heir of Saul  Mow'd down in battle by Philistian strength  On Gilboa's heights nor melted more in grief  O'er Absalom's fair locks too much endear'd  To blind parental fondness From the car  Descending Cimon spake Lo Persian chief  The just Athenian Aristides sends  These reliques which he honours to partake  Of sepulture as eastern rites ordain  Then art thou fall'n too confident exclaims  Mardonius too unmindful of my love  And anxious warnings Mithra veil thy face  In clouds In tears of blood thou sky dissolve  Earth groan and gen'ral nature join in woe  The tallest cedar of the orient groves  Lies prostrateDestiny malign I brave  Thy further maliceBlasted to the root  Is all my joy Here sorrow clos'd his lips  As frozen dead by wintry gusts he stood  Devoid of motion Mindarus was nigh  Whose interposing prudence thus was heard  O chief of nations numberless who stand  Spectators round and watch thy lightest look  Confine thy anguish in their sight revere  Thyself regard this messenger benign  From Aristides and thy native sense  Of obligation rouse Mardonius then  As from a trance I hear thee and approve  My gentle kinsman This returning car  With purest gold and costly vesture pil'd  Shall bear the copious tribute of my thanks  To Aristides whom extoll'd to heav'n  By excellent Masistius oft my soul  Hath heard the righteous by the righteous prais'd  Now Cimon interpos'd That man extoll'd  Thou dost not Persian lib'ral as thou art  Mean to offend thy presents then withhold  In poverty more glorious than in wealth  The wealthiest Aristides frowns at gold  No costly vestures decorate his frame  Itself divine the very arms he wears  The sole possession of that spotless man  All ornament reject he only boasts  The sharpest sword the weightiest spear and shield  Ha must I pass unthankful in the sight  Of one Masistius lov'd the chief reply'd  No answer'd quick th' Athenian from his cross  Take down Leonidas A stedfast look  Mardonius fix'd on Cimon That request  O Greek is big with danger to my head  Which I will hazard since the only price  Set on the precious reliques thou restor'st  This said he orders to his tent the corse  There on the claycold bosom of his friend  Thus plaintive hangs Fall'n pillar of my hopes  What is Mardonius wanting thy support  Thou arm of strength for ever are unbrac'd  Thy nerves Enlighten'd mind where prudence dwelt  Heart purify'd by honour you have left  Mardonius helpless left him to himself  To his own passions which thy counsel tam'd  The dang'rous paths of error I shall tread  Without thy guidance Shame defeat and death  Frown in thy wounds illbodingyet thy look  Not fate itself of gentleness deprives  By heaven a world shall mourn theeLoud he calls  Which Mindarus obeys To him the chief  Thou too didst love MasistiusFly proclaim  A gen'ral lamentation through the camp  Let all Boeotia sound Masistius lost  O verify'd too clearly boding dream  Of mine by him so fatally despis'd  See ev'ry head dismantled of its hair  The soldiers women eunuchs of his mane  See ev'ry steed the mule and camel shorn  O that the echo of our grief might pass  The Hellespont to Asia that her loss  Through all her cities through her vales and streams  Beyond the banks of Ganges might be told  As Mindarus departs the Theban chief  Approaches Leontiades who spake  If there be one O gen'ral can replace  Masistius wise that prodigy is found  Elēan Hegesistratus of seers  The most renown'd His penetrating mind  Can from the victim slain or mystic flight  Of birds foresee the dark events of

Dircaean grove  Where that pure fountain trills a mournful note  There shall Masistius in his name survive  Among the Greeks his last remains embalm'd  Among his fathers shall in Susa rest  The Theban

Trachiniae chief His pious love  Who did not love Masistius will convey  To distant Sestos his embalm'd remains  Thence o'er the narrow Hellespont to reach  His native Asia and his father's tomb  How did he fall Statirus Did he send  To me no counsel from his dying lips  These in a sigh the faithful page began  Were his last accents "Let Mardonius think  "How brief are life's enjoyments Virtue

Unpunish'd still th' existence of the gods  Were but a dream O longenduring Jove  Thy own Herculean offspring canst thou see  Defac'd by vultures and the parching wind  Yet wield resistless thunderBut thy ways  Are awfully mysterious to arraign  Thy heaviest doom is blasphemy Thy will  For me reserv'd the merit to redeem  These precious reliques penitent I own  My rashness thankful I accept the task  O mighty spirit who didst late inform  With ev'ry virtue that disfigur'd frame  With ev'ry kind affection prov'd by me  The last distinguish'd object of thy care  When it forbad me to partake thy fate  The life thy friendship sav'd I here devote  To vindicate thy manes Not the wrongs  Of gen'ral Greece not Locris giv'n to flames  Not the subversion of my father's house  E'er with such keen resentment stung my heart  As this indignity to thee He said  And with the aid of Haliartus free'd  The sacred bones Leonteus and the prime  Of Locris frame with substituted shields  Th'

sons of men Majestic shade  By unrelenting laws of Dis forbid  To enter where thy ancestors reside  Who seed of Jove to their Elysian joys  Expect thee most illustrious of the race  Amidst thy wand'rings on the banks of Styx  Dost thou recall Melissa's dirge of praise  O'er thee preparing by a glorious death  To save thy country O unbury'd still  Did not Melissa promise to thy dust  Peace in her temple An atrocious king  Hath barr'd awhile th' accomplishment thy friend  Thy soldier now will ratify my word  Soon to Lycurgus shall thy spirit pass  To Orpheus Homer and th' Ascraean sage  Who shall contend to praise thee in their bow'rs  Of amaranth and myrtle ever young  Like thy renown In Oeta's fane these bones  Dear to the Muses shall repose till Greece  Amid her future triumphs hath decreed  A tomb and temple to her saviour's fame  This high oblation of pathetic praise  Paid by her holy friend Sandaucè notes  Attentive seldom from Melissa's eye  Was she remote Her eunuchs she deputes  To bring a coffer large of od'rous wood  Inlaid with pearl repository due  To such divine remains In time appears  Th' Athenian gen'ral to applaud the deed  While thus the mighty manes he invokes  Hear thou preserver of thy country hear  Lo in his palms of Salamis the son  Of Neocles salutes thee From a hand  Which hath already half aveng'd thy death  Accept of decent rites Thy virtue

boast  Where Jupiter Trophonius is ador'd  Not far beyond Copaeae's neighb'ring lake  Which thou must pass With costly presents freight  Such as magnificence like thine requires  Thy loaded bark command my service all  Mardonius issues orders to provide  The bark and presents Summoning his chiefs  To them he spake My absence from the camp  Important functions claim three days of rule  To Mindarus I cede Till my return  Let not a squadron pass th' Asopian stream  This said with Hegesistratus he mounts  A rapid car Twelve giants of his guard  Detach'd before await him on the banks  Of clear Copaeae Silver Phoebè spreads  A light reposing on the quiet lake  Save where the snowy rival of her hue  The gliding swan behind him leaves a trail  In luminous vibration Lo an isle  Swells on the surface Marble structures there  New gloss of beauty borrow from the moon  To deck the shore Now silence gently yields  To measur'd strokes of oars The orange groves  In rich profusion round the fertile verge  Impart to fanning breezes fresh perfumes  Exhaustless visiting the sense with sweets  Which soften ev'n Briareus but the son  Of Gobryas heavy with devouring care  Uncharm'd unheeding sits At length began  Th' Elēan augur in a learned flow  Of ancient lore to Asia's pensive chief  storically thus Illustrious lord  Whose nod controuls such multitudes in arms  From lands remote and near the story learn  Of sage Trophonius whose prophetic cell  Thou wouldst descend An architect divine  He for the Delphians rais'd their Pythian fane  His recompense imploring from the god  This gracious answer from the god he drew  "When thrice my chariot hath its circle run  "The prime reward a mortal can obtain  "Trophonius shall be thine" Apollo thrice  His circle ran behold Trophonius dead  With prophecy his spirit was endu'd  But where abiding in concealment long  The destinies envelop'd Lo a dearth  Afflicts Boeotia Messengers address  The Delphian pow'r for succour He enjoins  Their care throughout Lebadian tracts to seek  Oracular Trophonius Long they roam  In fruitless search at last a honey'd swarm  Before them flies they follow and attain  A cave Their leader enters when a voice  Revealing there the deity suggests  Cure to their wants and knowledge of his will  How to be worshipp'd in succeeding times  To him the name of Jupiter is giv'n  He to the fatal sisters hath access  Sees Clotho's awful distaff sees the thread  Of human life by Lachesis thence drawn  Sees Atropos divide with direful shears  The slender line But rueful is the mode  Of consultation though from peril free  Within his dreary cell In thy behalf  Thou mayst a faithful substitute appoint  By Horomazes no exclaims the chief  It is the cause of empire from his post  Compels the Persian leader none but he  Shall with your god confer Transactions past  To Hegesistratus he now details  His heart unfolding nor conceals th' event  In Asia's camp when Aemnestus bold  The Spartan legate

whisp'ring motion breathes  Among the pliant leaves Now roseate tincts  Begin to streak the orient verge of heav'n  Foretok'ning day The son of Gobryas lands  Where in soft murmur down a channell'd slope  The stream Hercyna from Trophonian groves  Fresh bubbling meets Cephissus He ascends  With all his train Th' inclosure which begirds  The holy purlieus through a portal hung  With double valves on obelisks of stone  Access afforded to the steps of none  But suppliants Hegesistratus accosts  One in pontific vesture station'd there  Priest of Boeotia's oracle most fam'd  Dismiss all fear Thy

Surpassing all your treasur'd wealth can boast  His hours are precious nor admit delay  Accept his sumptuous off'rings and commence  The ceremonials due At first aghast  The holy man survey'd the giant guard  Soon admiration follow'd at thy form  Mardonius Low in stature if compar'd  With those unshapen savages sublime  Thou trod'st in majesty of mien and grace  Of just proportion Last the gems and gold  Bright vases tripods images and crowns  The presents borne by those gigantic hands  With fascinating lustre fix'd the priest  To gaze unsated on the copious store  Pass through but unaccompany'd he said  Illustrious Persian Be th' accepted gifts  Deposited within these holy gates  He leads the satrap to a grassy mount  Distinct with scatter'd plantains Each extends  O'er the smooth green his mantle brown of shade  Of marble white an edifice rotund  In all th' attractive elegance of art  Looks from the summit and invites the feet  Of wond'ring strangers to ascend The prince  By his conductor is instructed thus  Observe yon dome Thou first must enter there  Alone there fervent in devotion bow  Before two statues one of Genius good  Of Fortune fair the other At the word  Mardonius enters Chance directs his eye  To that expressive form of Genius good  Whose gracious lineaments sedately sweet  Recall Masistius to the gloomy chief  O melancholy who can give thee praise  Not sure the gentle them thy weight o'erwhelms  But thou art wholesome to intemp'rate minds  In vain by wisdom caution'd In the pool  Of black adversity let them be steep'd  Then pride and lust and fury thou dost tame  So now Mardonius by thy pow'r a enthrall'd  Sighs in these words humility of grief  If heav'n relenting will to me assign  A Genius good he bears no other name  Than of Masistius Oh thou spirit bless'd  For sure thy virtue dwells with endless peace  Canst thou her seat relinquishing awhile  Unseen or visible protect thy friend  In this momentous crisis of his fate  Or wilt thou if permitted Ah no more  Think of Mardonius fierce ambitious proud  But as corrected by thy precepts mild  Who would forego his warmest hopes of fame  Of pow'r and splendour gladly to expire  If so the myriads trusted to his charge  He might preserve nor leave whole nations fall'n  A prey to vultures on these hostile plains  Come and be witness to the tears which flow  Sure tokens of sincerity in me  Not us'd to weep who humbled at thy loss  Melt like a maiden of her love bereav'd  By unrelenting death My demon kind  Do thou descend and Fortune will pursue  Spontaneous and auspicious on her wheel  A track unchang'd Here turning he adores  Her flatt'ring figure and forsakes the dome  Along Hercyna's bank they now proceed  To where the river parts One channel holds  A sluggish creeping water under vaults  Of ebon shade and soporific yew  The growth of ages on the level line  Of either joyless verge The satrap here  Nam'd and presented by his former guide  A second priest receives conductor new  Through nightresembling shadows which obscure  The sleepy stream unmoving to the sight  Or moving mute A fountain they approach  One of Hercyna's sources From the pores  Of spongy rock an artificial vase  Of jetty marble in its round collects  The slowdistilling moisture Hence the priest  A brimming chalice to Mardonius bears  Whom in these words he solemnly accosts  This fount is nam'd of Lethè Who consults  Our subterranean deity must quaff  Oblivion here of all preceding thoughts  Sensations and affections Reach the draught  If such oblivious sweets this cup contains  I gladly grasp it cries the chief and drinks  Ascending thence a mazy walk they tread  Where all the season's florid children shew  Their gorgeous rayment and their odours breathe  Unspent while musical in murmur flows  Fast down a steep declivity of bed  Hercyna winding in a channel new  Apparent often to the glancing eye  Through apertures which pierce the loaden boughs  Of golden fruit Hesperian and th' attire  Of myrtles green o'ershadowing the banks  In alabaster's variegated hues  To bound the pleasing avenue a fane  Its symmetry discover'd on a plat  Thickset with roses which a circling skreen  Of that fair ash where cluster'd berries glow  From ruffling gusts defended Thither speeds  Mardonius there deliver'd to a third  Religious minister supreme Two youths  In snowlike vesture and of lib'ral mien  Sons of Lebadian citizens attend  Entit'led Mercuries The seer address'd  The Persian warrior In this mansion pure  Mnemosynè is worshipp'd so in Greece  The pow'r of memory is styl'd Advance  Invoke her aid propitious to retain  Whate'er by sounds or visions in his cave  The prophet god reveals The chief comply'd  The hallow'd image he approach'd and spake  Thou art indeed a goddess I revere  Now to Mardonius if some dream or sign  Prognosticate success and thou imprint  The admonitions of unerring heav'n  In his retentive mind this arm this sword  Shall win thy further favour to record  His name and glory on the rolls of time  This said with lighter steps he quits the fane  The Mercuries conduct him to a bath  Fed from Hercyna's fairer second source  In shade sequester'd close While there his limbs  Are disarray'd of armour to assume  A civil garment soon as spotless streams  Have purify'd his frame the priest who stands  Without in ecstacy of joy remarks  The rich Mardonian off'rings on their way  By servitors transported to enlarge  The holy treasure Instant he prepares  For sacrifice A sable ram is slain  Fresh from ablution lo Mardonius comes  In linen vesture fine and white as down  Of Paphian doves A sash of tincture bright  Which rivall'd Flora's brilliancy of dye  Engirds his loins majestical his brows  A wreath sustain Lebadian sandals ease  His steps Exchanging thus his martial guise  Like some immortal of a gentler mold  Than Mars he moves So Phoebus when he sets  Lav'd by the nymphs of Tethys in their grot  Of coral after his diurnal toil  Repairs his splendours and his rosy track  Of morn resumes With partial eyes the priest  Explores the victim's entrails and reports  Each sign auspicious with a willing tongue  Then to Mardonius Thee Boeotia's friend  Magnificently pious to her gods  Thee I pronounce a votary approv'd  By this Boeotian deity Now seek  In confidence the cavern But the rites  Demand that first an image thou approach  Which none but those in purity of garb  None but accepted suppliants of the god  Can lawfully behold Above the bath  A rock was hollow'd to an ample space  Thence issued bubbling waters See he said  The main Hercynian fount whose face reflects  Yon Daedalēan workmanship the form  Trophonius bears Adore that rev'rend beard  The twisted serpents round that awful staff  Those looks which pierce the mysteries of fate  Next through a winding cavity and vast  He guides the prince along a mossy vault  Rough with protuberant and tortuous roots  Of ancient woods which clothing all above  In depth shoot downward equal to their height  Suspended lamps with livid glympse and faint  Direct their darkling passage Now they reach  The further mouth unclosing in a dale  Abrupt there shadow neverfleeting rests  Rudefeatur'd crags o'erhanging thence expel  The blaze of noon Beneath a frowning clift  A native arch of altitude which tempts  The soaring eagle to construct his nest  Expands before an excavation deep  Unbowelling the hill On either side  This gate of nature hoary sons of time  Enlarg'd by ages to protentous growth  Impenetrable yews augment the gloom  In height two cubits on the rocky floor  A parapet was rais'd of marble white  In circular dimension this upholds  The weight of polish'd obelisks by zones  Of brass connected ornamental fence  A wicket opens to th' advancing prince  Steps moveable th' attentive priest supplies  By whom instructed to the awful chasm  Below profound but narrow where the god  His inspiration breathes th' intrepid son  Of Gobryas firm descends His nether limbs  Up to the loins he plunges Downward drawn  As by a whirlpool of some rapid flood  At once the body is from sight conceal'd  Entranc'd he lies in subterranean gloom  Less dark than superstition She who caus'd  His bold adventure with her wonted fumes  Of perturbation from his torpid state  Awakes him rather in a dream suggests  That he is waking On a naked bank  He seems to stand before him sleeps a pool  Edg'd round by desert mountains in their height  Obscuring heav'n Without impulsive oars  Without a sail spontaneous flies a bark  Above the stagnant surface which untouch'd  Maintains its silence On the margin rests  The skiff presenting to the hero's view  An aged fire of penetrating ken  His weight inclining on an ebon staff  With serpents wreath'd who beck'ning thus began  If feed of Gobryas thou wouldst know thy fate  Embark with me Trophonius I am call'd  Th' undaunted chief obeys In flight more swift  Than eagles swiftest of the feather'd kind  Th' unmoving water's central spot they gain  At once its bosom opens down they sink  In depth to equal that immane descent  Of Hercules to Pluto yet perform  As in a moment their portentous way  Around above the liquid mass retires  In concave huge suspended nor bedews  Their limbs or garments Two stupendous valves  Of adamant o'er half the bottom spread  Them with his mystic rod the prophet smites  Selflifted they a spacious grot expose  Whose pointed spar is tipt with dancing light  Beyond Phoebean clear The Persian looks  Intelligent he looks Words names and things  Recurring gather on his anxious mind  When he who seems Trophonius Down this cave  None but the gods oracular may pass  Here dwell the fatal Sisters at their toil  The Destinies thou see'st The thread newdrawn  Is thine Mardonius Instantly a voice  Which shakes the grot and all the concave round  Sounds Aemnestus Swift the direful shears  The line dissever and Mardonius whirl'd  Back from Trophonian gloom is found supine  Within the marble parapet which fenc'd  The cavern's mouth The watchful priest conducts  The agitated satrap mute and sad  Back to Mnemosynè's abode His eyes  Are sternly fix'd Now prince the seer began  Divulge whatever thou hast heard and seen  Before this goddess Priest he said suspend  Thy function now importunate Remove  The seer withdrawn the Persian thus alone  Then be it so To luxury and pow'r  Magnificence and pleasure I must bid  Farewell Leonidas let Greece extol  Me too shall Persia Goddess to thy charge  A name so dearly purchas'd I consign  This said in haste his armour he resumes  Not as Leonidas compos'd yet brave  Amid the gloom of trouble he prefers  Death to dishonour O'er the holy ground  He pensive treads a parallel to Saul  Return'd from Endor's necromantic cell  In sadness still magnanimously firm  Ne'er to survive his dignity but face  Predicted ruin and in battle slain  Preserve his fame Mardonius finds the gates  His friends rejoins glides down Cephissian floods  Copaeae's lake repasses and is lodg'd  In his own tent by midnight Sullen there  He sits disturb'd he shuns repose access  Forbids to all but Lamachus intrudes  Nefarious counsellor in fell device  Surpassing fellest tyrants Now hath night  Upcall'd her clouds black signal for the winds  To burst their dungeons cataracts of rain  Mix with blue fires th' ethereal concave groans  Stern looks Mardonius on the daring Greek  Who in his wiles confiding thus began  Supreme o'er nations numberless in arms  Sole hope of Asia thy return I greet  With joy Thy absence hath employ'd my soul  To meditate the means the certain means  For thee to prosper Lo the active son  Of Neocles who keeps th' Oetaean pass  Lo Aristides in the camp of Greece  Remain thy only obstacles Her pow'r  Of them depriv'd would moulder and disperse  Devoid of counsel with an edgless sword  Uncommon danger stimulates the wise  To search for safety through uncommon paths  Much more when pow'r when empire and renown  Hang on a crisis If a serpent's guile  Behind the pillows of such foes might lurk  If darting thence his unsuspected sting  Might pierce their bosoms if the ambient air  Could by mysterious alchymy be chang'd  To viewless poison and their cups infect  With death such help would policy disdain  Hast thou not hardy and devoted slaves  Try their fidelity and zeal No life  Can be secure against a daring hand  Two Grecian deaths confirm thee lord of Greece  He ceas'd expecting praise but honour burns  Fierce in the satrap's elevated soul  Dar'st thou suggest such baseness to the son  Of Gobryas furious he exalts his voice  Guards seize and strangle this pernicious wolf  Time but to wonder at his sudden fate  The ready guards afford him and the wretch  Fit retribution for his crimes receives  This act of eastern equity expels  The satrap's gloom Now Grecian gods he cries  Smile on my justice From th' assassin's point  I guard your heroes By yourselves I swear  My preservation or success assur'd  By such unmanly turpitude I spurn  His mind is cheer'd A tender warmth succeeds  Predominant in am'rous eastern hearts  A balm to grief and victor mild of rage  The midnight hour was past a season dear  To softlytripping Venus Through a range  Of watchful eunuchs in apartments gay  He seeks the female quarter of his tent  Which like a palace of extent superb  Spreads on the field magnificence Soft lutes  By snowy fingers touch'd sweetwarbled song  From ruby lips which harmonize the air  Impregnated with rich Panchaean scents  Salute him ent'ring Gentle hands unclasp  His martial harness in a tepid bath  Lave and perfume his muchenduring limbs  A couch is strewn with roses he reclines  In thinlywoven Taffeta So long  In pond'rous armour cas'd he scarcely feels  The light and loose attire Around him smile  Circassian Graces and the blooming flow'rs  Of beauty cull'd from ev'ry clime to charm  Lo in transcending ornament of dress  A fairone allsurpassing greets the chief  But pale her lip and wild her brilliant eye  Nam'd from Bethulia where I drew my breath  I by a father's indigence betray'd  Became thy slave yet noble my descent  From Judith everfam'd whose beauty sav'd  Her native place Indignant I withstood  Thy passion Gentle still a master's right  Thou didst forbear and my reluctant charms  Leave unprophan'd by force Repuls'd thy love  Grew cold Too late contemplating thy worth  I felt a growing flame but ne'er again  Could win thy favour In the Haram's round  Disconsolate neglected I have walk'd  Have seen my gay companions to thy arms  Preferr'd professing passion far unlike  To mine Mardonius Now despair suggests  To give thee proof of undissembled truth  Which no neglect hath cool'd To thy success  Thy glory my virginity is vow'd  In this bright raiment with collected pow'rs  Of beauty I at Aristides' feet  Will throw me prostrate To th' alluring face  Of my progenitrix a victim fell  Th' Assyrian captain Holofernes proud  So shall thy foe of Athens fall by mine  The meritorious and heroic deed  Soon will erase the transitory stain  O if successful let Bethulia hope  For thy reviving love Mardonius starts  In dubious trouble Whether to chastise  So fierce a spirit or its zeal admire  He hesitates Compassion for the sex  At length prevails suggesting this reply  Fell magnanimity enormous proof  Of such intemp'rate passion I forgive  While I reject thy proffer'd crime although  The deed might fix my glory and success  And in return for thy prepos'trous love  Will safe replace thee in thy native seat  With gifts to raise from indigence thy house  But never never from this hour will view  Thy face again Bethulia Eunuchs hear  Remove conceal this woman from my sight  No thou inhuman thus Bethulia wild  This shall remove for ever from thy sight  A woman scorn'd and terminate her pains  She said and struck a poniard through her heart  With shrieks the Haram sounds th' afflicted fair  The eunuchs shudder when the satrap thus  Is this another black portent of ill  Stern Horomazes or is this my crime  No thou art just My conscious spirit feels  Thy approbation of Mardonius now  But from his breast the dire event expels  All soft and am'rous cares His vast command  His long inaction and the dread of shame  Recur He quits the chamber to his own  Repairing summons Mindarus and firm  In aspect speaks The morning soon will dawn  Draw down our slingers archers and the skill'd  In flying darts to line th' Asopian brink  Thence gall the Grecians whose diurnal wants  That flood relieves Then Mindarus O chief  This instant sure intelligence is brought  That from the isthmus to supply their camp  A convoy rich in plenty is descry'd  Advancing tow'rds Cithaeron's neighb'ring pass  Mardonius quick No moment shall be lost  Bid Tiridates with five thousand horse  Possess that pass and pouring on the plain  Secure the precious store This said he seeks  A short repose and Mindarus withdraws  In arms anon to paragon the morn  The morn newrising whose vermillion hand  Draws from the bright'ning front of heav'n serene  The humid curtains of tempestuous night  Mardonius mounts his courser On his bank  The godlike figure soon Asopus views  End of the Twentyseventh Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the TWENTYEIGHTH  WHILE lamentation for Masistius dead  Depress'd the Persians undisturb'd the Greeks  To all their camp refreshment had deriv'd  From clear Asopus To th' accustom'd edge  Of his abounding flood they now resort  Stones darts and arrows from unnumber'd ranks  Along the margin opposite dispos'd  By Mindarus forbid access Repulse  Disbands the Greeks Exulting he forgets  Cleora active valour in his breast  Extinguishes the embers cherish'd long  By selftormenting memory and warmth  Of fruitless passion Present too his chief  His friend and kinsman from a fiery steed  Mardonius rules and stimulates the fight  Like Boreas riding on a stormy cloud  Whence issue darts of light'ning mix'd with hail  In rattling show'rs The enemies dispers'd  Embolden Mindarus to ford the stream  In guidance swift of cavalry expert  With unresisted squadrons he careers  Along the field Inviolate the flood  He guards each hostile quarter he insults  Now Gobryas' son unfetter'd from the bonds  Of superstitious terrors joyful sees  In Mindarus a new Masistius rise  Nor less the tidings Tiridates sends  Who in Cithaeron's passes hath despoil'd  The slaughter'd foes inspire the gen'ral's thoughts  Which teem with arduous enterprise The camp  He empties all beneath whose forming host  The meadow sounds The native Persians face  Laconia's station Greek allies oppose  Th' Athenian All the force of Thebes array'd  Envenom'd Leontiades commands  Greece in her lines sits tranquil either host  Expects the other By their augurs still  Restrain'd they shun the interdicted ford  But of the river's plenteous stream depriv'd  By Mindarus the Grecians fear a dearth  Of that allcheering element A rill  Flows from a distant spring Gargaphia nam'd  Their sole resource Nor dread of other wants  Afflicts them less their convoy is o'erpow'r'd  By Tiridates Anxious all exhaust  A night disturb'd the bravest grieve the most  Lest through severe necessity they quit  Inglorious their position Morning shines  When frequent signals from th' external guards  Near and remote successive rise To arms  All rush Along the spacious public way  From Megara obscuring dust ascends  The sound of trampling hoofs and laden wheels  With shouts of multitude is heard Behold  Forth from the cloud a messenger of joy  Sicinus breaks of bold auxiliar bands  Forerunner swift and unexpected aid  In copious stores at Megara's wide port  Newlanded from Thermopylae The camp  Admits and hails in rapturous acclaim  Euboean standards Potidaea's ranks  The laurell'd priest and hero Timon sage  Th' ennobled heir of Lygdamis and thee  Melissa's brother great Oïleus' son  Friend of Leonidas thee dear to all  O brave and gen'rous Medon From their tents  The chiefs assemble when Sicinus spake  Pausanius gen'ral of united Greece  Accept these ample succours from the hand  Of provident Themistocles Possess'd  Of Oeta's passes he the Persian host  Now with impenetrable toils besets  Like beasts of prey entangled by the skill  Of some experienc'd hunter Thou receive  Just Aristides from Timothea's love  A suit of armour new in Chalcis fram'd  Without luxuriant ornament or gold  The shield an emblem of thy soul displays  Truth equity and wisdom hand in hand  This for her children and thy own consign'd  To her Euboean roof and pious care  She bids thee lift and conquer Thou restore  The little exiles in their native homes  To dwell in peace Her gift she adds derives  Its only value from the wearer's worth  In smiles like Saturn at the tribute pure  Of fruits and flow'rs in singleness of heart  Paid by religion of the golden age  Timothea's gift the righteous man receives  Not righteous more than practic'd to endure  Heroic labours soon by matchless deeds  To justify the giver He began  Confederated warriors who withstand  A tyrant's pow'r unanimous confess  Your debt to great Themistocles the lord  Of alladmir'd Timothea He and I  Evince the fruits of concord Ancient foes  Through her united cheerful we sustain  Our public charge From gen'ral union Greece  Expects her safety Him success hath crown'd  In arms and counsel whether on the main  His naval flag he spread or shook the land  With his triumphant step O heroborn  Pausanias glowing with Herculean blood  Now under thee let Aristides hope  To share success nor tarnish with disgrace  His armour new Behold yon river gleams  With hostile arms Those standards on the left  Wellknown to Attic eyes are proudly borne  By native Medes and Persians Treach'rous Thebes  Lifts her Cadmēan banner on the right  A second time Mardonius forms his host  To proffer battle He perhaps may ford  Asopus which Tisamenus the learn'd  In divination hath forbid our steps  To pass Thy former numbers swift arrange  New from a march let these auxiliars guard  The camp To him Pausanias thus apart  Athenian hear Your citizens are vers'd  In this Barbarian warfare yet unknown  To us Let Spartans and Athenians change  Their station You an adversary try'd  At Marathon and foil'd will best oppose  To vanquish Grecians we accustom'd long  Will yon Boeotians and Thessalians face  Such is my will Concise the Attic sage  Thou hast commanded what my willing thoughts  Themselves devis'd but waited first to hear  Well canst thou fight Pausanias I will strive  To imitate thy deeds and thy renown  On whose increase our liberty and laws  Depend This said they part Behind the rear  Soon from the left th' Athenians from the right  The Spartans file Their stations they exchange  Not by Mardonius unperceiv'd He moves  His Medes and Persians to the post of Thebes  Whence still the Spartan phalanx they confront  The Thebans still th' Athenian This observ'd  Pausanias swift to Aristides sends  Strict charge his old position to resume  Now indignation high through all the tribes  Of Athens rages Noble pride and sense  Of just desert in exclamation fierce  Break from th' exalted populace who claim  Their soil for parent Gods from wing to wing  Must we like servile mercenary bands  Like Helots slaves to Lacedaemon born  Be hurry'd thus obsequious to controul  From an imperious Spartan Tegea first  Contested our prerogative The pride  Of Sparta next removes us from the post  Assign'd by public judgment we comply  Must we at her contemptuous nod resume  The station we forsook Defending Greece  Ourselves meanwhile deserted and betray'd  Twice have we lost our city What is left  Of our abandon'd residence but dust  Let Greece defend herself Let us remove  For the last time our standards hoist our sails  Our floating empire fix on distant shores  Our household gods our progeny and name  On some new soil establish sure to find  None so ingrate as this The Athenians thus  Swell with ingenuous ire as ocean boils  Disturb'd by Eurus and the rude career  Of Boreas threat'ning furious to surmount  All circumscription But as oft a cloud  Distilling gentle moisture as it glides  Dissolves the rigour of their boist'rous wings  Till o'er the main serenity returns  So from the mouth of Aristides fall  Composing words Insensibly he sooths  Their justlyirritated minds and calms  Their just resentment Righteousness and truth  How prevalent your efforts when apply'd  By placid wisdom In these strains he spake  Ye men of Athens at Laconia's call  To meet the flow'r of Asia's host in fight  Do ye repine A station which implies  Preeminence of Attic worth a task  Of all most glorious which the martial race  Of Sparta shuns and you should covet most  Ye Marathonian victors In the fight  Of Greece who trembles at a Median garb  You are preferr'd for valour Arms the same  The same embroider'd vestment on their limbs  Effeminate the same unmanly souls  Debas'd by vices and monarchal rule  The Medes retain as when their vanquish'd ranks  Fled heretofore With weapons often try'd  With confidence by victories increas'd  Not now for liberty and Greece alone  You march to battle but to keep unspoil'd  Your trophies won already and the name  Which Marathon and Salamis have rais'd  Preserve unstain'd that men may ever say  Not through your leaders not by fortune there  You triumph'd but by fortitude innate  And lib'ral vigour of Athenian blood  He said and march'd All follow mute through love  Of Aristides inexpressive love  Which melts each bosom Solemn they proceed  Though lionlike in courage at his call  Meek and obedient as the fleecy breed  To wonted notes of Pan's conducting pipe  Arriv'd disbanded in their sep'rate tents  Cecropia's tribes exhaust a tedious night  Unvisited by sleep The morning breaks  Instead of joy to gratulate her light  The tone of sadness from dejected hearts  Combining sighs and groans in murmur deep  Alarms the leader Aristides shew  Thy countenance amongst us hasty spake  The warriorpoet ent'ring All thy camp  Enthusiastic sorrow hath o'erwhelm'd  And ev'ry heart unbrac'd By earliest dawn  Each left his restless couch Their first discourse  Was calm and fill'd with narratives distinct  Of thy accomplishments and worth At length  A soldier thus in agitation spake  "Yet O most excellent of Gods O Jove  "This is the man we banish'd In thy sight  "The most excelling man whose sole offence  "Was alltranscending merit from his home  "Our impious votes expell'd by envy's spight  "Seduc'd We drove him fugitive through Greece  "Where still he held ungrateful Athens dear  "For whose redemption from her sloth he rous'd  "All Greece to arms" The soldier clos'd in floods  Of anguish Instant through the concourse ran  Contagious grief as if the fiend Despair  From his black chariot wheeling o'er their heads  In clouds of darkness dropp'd his pois'nous dews  Of melancholy down to chill the blood  Unnerve the limbs and fortitude dissolve  Speed Aristides By th' immortal pow'rs  The feeblest troop of Persians in this hour  Might overcome the tame desponding force  Of thy dear country mistress long confess'd  Of eloquence and arts of virtue now  Through thy unerring guidance Here the sage  Withhold thy praise good AeschylusBe swift  Arrange my fellow citizens in arms  Beneath each ensign of the sev'ral tribes  I will appear a comforter a friend  Their public servant Aeschylus withdraws  Soon Aristides in his armour new  Timothea's gift advances from his tent  Should from his throne th' Omnipotent descend  In visitation of the human race  While dreading his displeasure as to earth  All heads would bend in reverential awe  Contrite and conscious of their own misdeeds  So look th' Athenians though in all the pomp  Of Mars array'd and terrible to half  The world in battle Down their corslets bright  Tears trickle tears of penitence and shame  To see their injur'd patriot chief assume  In goodness heav'n's whole semblance as he moves  Observant by and through the weeping ranks  From man to man his lib'ral hand extends  Consoling No resentment he could shew  Who none had felt Ascending now on high  He thus address'd the penitential throng  Rate not too high my merit nor too low  Your own depreciate Error is the lot  Of man but lovely in the eye of heav'n  Is sense of error Better will you fight  As better men from these auspicious tears  Which evidence your worth and please the gods  With strength and valour equity of mind  Uniting doubles fortitude Your wives  Your progeny and parents laws and rites  Were ne'er so well secur'd The warlike bard  Rose next Requested by the sev'ral tribes  In their behalf I promise to thy rule  All acquiescence Bid them fight retreat  Maintain or yield a station bid them face  Innumerable foes surmount a foss  Deep as the sea or bulwarks high as rocks  Subordination vigilance contempt  Of toil and death thy dictates shall command  Th' Oïlean hero Timon and the seed  Of Lygdamis are present who encamp'd  Among th' Athenians They admire the chief  Nor less the people While the term of morn  Was passing thus a summons to his tent  Calls Aristides Aemnestus there  Salutes him Attic friend a new event  In Sparta's quarter is to thee unknown  From me accept th' intelligence The sun  Was newly ris'n when o'er th' Asopian flood  An Eastern herald pass'd Bèhind him tow'r'd  A giantsiz'd Barbarian He approach'd  Our camp before Pausanias brought he spake  "I am Briareus of Mardonian guards  "Commander Through my delegated mouth  "Thus saith the son of Gobryas I have heard  "Among the Greeks your prowess vaunted high  "Ye men of Sparta that in martial ranks  "You either kill or perish but I find  "Fame is a liar I expected long  "You would defy me on the field of war  "Have I not seen you shift from wing to wing  "The task imposing on th' Athenians twice  "To face the Medes and Persians while yourselves  "Sought with our servants to contend in arms  "Ye brave in name alone Since you decline  "To challenge us we prime of eastern blood  "With equal numbers challenge you to prove  "That you possess what rumour hath proclaim'd  "The boldest hearts in Greece Acknowledge else  "Your boasted valour bury'd in the grave  "With your Leonidas o'erthrown and slain"  Pausanias gave no answer not through fear  But humour torpid and morose which wrapp'd  In clouds of scorn his brow Consulting none  With silent pride the giant he dismiss'd  The challenger in triumph turning back  Repass'd the river Aemnestus paus'd  A second messenger appear'd Behold  In blooming vigour flush'd by rapid haste  Young Menalippus from the rev'rend seer  Megistias sprung Athenian chief he said  Bring down thy active missileweapon'd troops  On their immediate help Pausanias calls  A cloud of hostile cavalry invests  Laconia's quarter Javelins arrows darts  In sheets discharg'd have choak'd our last resource  Gargaphia's fountain and our heavy bands  Perplex and harrass Aristides hears  And issues swift his orders while the youth  Continues thus Thou knew'st of old my sire  Who at Thermopylae expir'd The just  Consort together Aristides thus  Ingenuous youth for Greece thy father bled  A spotless victim but for ever lives  Companion with Leonidas in fame  By heav'n protected thou shalt live to see  Their death aton'd the period is not far  Come on my force is ready Medon arms  With Haliartus once the shepherdswain  In Oeta's pass to Menalippus known  Whom both embrace with gratulation kind  All march but reach not Sparta's distant wing  Before the Persians sated with success  Fil'd back to join Mardonius Secret he  Was communing with Mirzes most renown'd  Among the Magi Thus the satrap clos'd  Through each occurrence undisguis'd O sage  My circumstantial narrative hath run  From where I enter'd first Trophonian ground  Till my descent and vision in the cave  Speak frankly Mirzesnor believe thy words  Whatever black presages they contain  Subjoin'd to all Trophonius hath foretold  Can change my firm resolves or blunt my sword  Solicitude for Persia to excess  Misled thee satrap to that graven god  Rejoins the Magus where if ought besides  The craft of Grecian mercenary priests  It was the demon Arimanius rul'd  He long hath prompted that Elēan seer  Who blunts thy sword by divination false  What thou dost vision call was empty dream  Imagination heated and disturb'd  A texture wild and various intermix'd  With illmatch'd images of things which last  Oppress'd thy mind Thy own distemper fram'd  Th' unreal grot where Destinies of air  In apparition cut thy vital thread  Their act was thine the oracle thy own  All vague creation of thy erring sleep  Briareus enters At his tidings glad  Which ostentation sounded thus exults  Mardonius Sayst thou Lacedaemon's chief  Was mute when my defiance shook his ear  Hence to the winds ye auguries and signs  Ye dreams and mysteries of Greece avaunt  Thou Horomazes not in marble fanes  Nor woods oracular and caves dost dwell  It is the pow'r of evil there misguides  Insensate mortals and misguided me  O Artemisia now shall Gobryas' son  Look only where no mystery can lurk  On ev'ry manly duty Nothing dark  The tracks of honour shades To chiefs select  Greek and Barbarian summon'd he reveals  His fix'd resolves in council They disperse  To execute his will Among the rest  Young Alexander Macedonia's lord  Speeds to his quarters in the solemn bow'r  Of Dircè There Mardonius had decreed  A cenotaph of marble newlyrais'd  To his deplor'd Masistius There the queen  Of Macedon Phoebean Timon's child  Bright Amarantha like an ev'ning bird  Whose trill delights a melancholy grove  Oft with harmonious skill in Delphian strains  Th' ingenuous practice of her maiden days  Sung of her father and Masistius good  That friend that known protector She her lute  Was now in cadence with Dircaean rills  Attuning Vocal melody she breath'd  Which at another season might have won  Her lord from sadness Sighing he her song  Thus interrupts Ah consort dear as fair  I come from Persia's council where the son  Of Gobryas urg'd by fear of sudden want  Through his wide host nor animated less  By Spartan silence at the challenge proud  His herald bore determines to reject  The augur's warnings O'er the stream he means  To lead th' embattled nations and surprise  Ere dawn at least assail the camp of Greece  In ev'ry station If she quits her lines  Then will his num'rous cavalry surround  Her heavy phalanx on the level space  O that my ancestor had never left  His Grecian home in Argos nor acquir'd  Emathia's crown I never then compell'd  Had borne reluctant arms against a race  By friendship link'd affinity and blood  With me and mine What horror cries the queen  While fear surmises that my husband's sword  May blindly cut my father's vital thread  But not alone such parricide to shun  Should wake thy efforts Alexander no  Thou must do more Our mutual words recall  When thou to Athens by Mardonius sent  Didst from thy fruitless ambassy rejoin  Me in Trachiniae whence the Barb'rous chief  Renew'd his march to lay Cecropian domes  In fresh destruction "What a lot is mine  "Thou saidst If Xerxes triumph I become  "A slave in purple Should the Greeks prevail  "Should that Euboean conqueror the son  "Of Neocles be sent th' Athenian scourge  I interrupted thus "Awhile dear lord  "We must submit to wear the galling mask  "Necessity imposes New events  "Are daily scatter'd by the restless palm  "Of fortune Some will prove propitious Wise  "To all benignant Aristides serv'd  "By us in season will befriend our state"  Behold that season come let Grecian blood  Which warms thy veins inspire thy prudent tongue  This night th' Athenian hero to apprise  Of all these tidings Thus secure the Greeks  Against surprisal timely thus oblige  The first of men and magnify thy name  In Greece for ages Here the youthful king  Though by oppressive Xerxes forc'd to war  Shall I abuse the confidence repos'd  By great Mardonius qualify'd to win  Regard at first which intercourse augments  I will do all by honour's rules allow'd  Will act a neutral part withdraw my troops  Ev'n at the hazard of my crown and life  If such my queen's injunction Ah forbear  To frown what means this flushing of thy cheek  Must I betray Mardonius to his foes  She spake abrupt he started at her look  If forc'd obedience to a tyrant binds  If more than I Mardonius holds thy heart  Who has thy dearest confidence abus'd  Thou wilt discredit my accusing tongue  Could from this empty monument the shade  Of just Masistius rise his awful voice  Would verify a story till this hour  From thee conceal'd My virgin hand in blood  Of one Barbarian miscreant once I stain'd  Not to pollute my hymeneal state  Nor lay Mardonius gasping at my feet  Like Mithridates in the streets of Thebes  This hateful camp for Delphi I forsook  Fled from a lawless and presumptuous flame  Insulting me thy queen who boast descent  From holy Timon While for his behoof  Collecting Greeks against their country's cause  Thyself was absent and Mardonius left  My only guardian scorning every tie  His daring importunity of love  Assail'd thy consort's ear What hope what trust  In such Barbarians All their faith expir'd  With good Masistius Should the Greeks be foil'd  How long will Macedon thy realm how long  Will Amarantha be securely held  Against a satrap whose ungovern'd will  May covet both Of this O prince be sure  Her part of shame will Amarantha bear  But brief shall be its date The poniard still  Which once preserv'd my honour I possess  To cut my period of dishonour short  The prince impatient yet attentive heard  Her words when thus the measure of his wrath  From his full bosom rapidly o'erflow'd  O impious breach of hospitable ties  O violation base of rights and laws  Exacting swift revenge from heav'n and man  From me the first Unparallel'd in form  O like the sister of thy Delphian god  Immaculate Did sacrilegious hands  This pure abode of chastity assail  With profanation Less a friend to Greece  Than foe to false Mardonius now I go  He said and order'd forth his swiftest steed  By moonlight twinkling on a shaded track  He urg'd his secret way beyond the springs  Asopian whence an outlet short and close  Through mount Cithaeron to th' adjacent line  Of Aristides led Meantime the sound  Of steps advancing Amarantha heard  She heard and saw Mardonius He his pace  Stopp'd short inclining with obeisance low  His stately frame Through terror and amaze  To earth she rigid grew of pow'r to fly  Depriv'd He distant spake Imperial dame  That he offended once Mardonius makes  A penitent confession O that fault  To no innate discourtesy impute  But Eastern manners not as Grecian pure  The ignorance which err'd by thee is chang'd  To veneration From my presence here  Which ne'er before intruded on this seat  Of thy retirement do not too severe  A new offence interpret rest assur'd  A solemn cause impels He silent waits  Nor moves till gliding silently away  Like Dian fair and chaste but less severe  The queen withdrew and tow'rds a gallant chief  Perhaps by her devices near his fall  Thus far relented for the private wrong  The frank atonement rais'd a generous sigh  Against the public enemy of Greece  Unquenchable she burn'd Now left alone  Before the cenotaph he kneel'd and spake  Tomorrow O tomorrow let my helm  Blaze in thy beams auspicious spirit bright  Whose name adorns this honorary tomb  The weight of Asia's mighty weal the weight  Of fifty myriads on thy friend augments  From hour to hour Yet purg'd of gloomy thoughts  Clear of ambition save to win the palm  Of victory for Xerxes I approach  Thy suppliant Thou an intercessor pure  For me deceiv'd by Grecian seers and gods  Before the throne of Horomazes stand  That he may bless my standards if alone  To guard so many worshippers and spread  By their success his celebrated name  Through each Hesperian clime Now grant a sign  Masistius ere thy faithful friend depart  Fix'd as he is to vanquish or to fall  He ceas'd Quick rapture dims his cheated eyes  He sees in thought a canopy of light  Descending o'er the tomb In joy he speeds  To preparation for the destin'd march  End of the Twentyeighth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the TWENTYNINTH  AMONG the Greeks their first nocturnal watch  Was near its period From Laconia's wing  Return'd th' Athenian leader thus bespake  Sicinus Worthy of my trust give ear  Within six hours the army will decamp  To chuse a friendlier station so the chiefs  In gen'ral council as Gargaphia choak'd  Withholds her wonted succour have resolv'd  At Juno's fane yet undespoil'd though near  Plataea's ruins ev'ry band is charg'd  To reassemble Suddenly appears  A centinel who speaks A stranger near  The trenches waits thee us in peaceful words  Saluting he importunate requires  Thy instant presence Aristides hastes  To whom the stranger Bulwark of this camp  Hear credit weigh the tidings which I bear  Mardonius press'd by fear of threat'ning want  At night's fourth watch the fatal stream will pass  Inflexibly determin'd though forbid  By each diviner to assail your host  With all his numbers I against surprise  Am come to warn you thee alone I trust  My name revealing I O man divine  I who thus hazard both my realm and life  Am Alexander Macedonian friend  Of Athens Kindly on a future day  Remember me He said and spurr'd his steed  Back through the op'ning of Cithaeron's hill  By Aristides instantly detach'd  Sicinus calls each leader to attend  Pausanias Attica's great captain joins  The council full His tidings he relates  Concluding thus with exhortation sage  We destitute of water had resolv'd  To change our station Now without a pause  We must anticipate th' appointed hour  For this retreat nor ling'ring tempt the force  Of squadrons swift to intercept our march  All move your standards Let Mardonius bring  A host discourag'd by their augur's voice  Who are forbid to pass the fatal stream  But are compell'd by famine and despair  To inauspicious battle We to heav'n  Obedient heav'n's assistance shall obtain  A situation safeguard to our flanks  Against superior and surrounding horse  In sight of burnt Plataea of her fanes  Defac'd and violated gods I know  There will assure you conquest All assent  At once the diff'rent Grecians who compose  The center lift their ensigns O'er the plain  First swiftly tow'rds Plataean Juno's dome  Speeds Adimantus In array more slow  The rest advance Cleander guards the rear  Brave youth whom chance malicious will bereave  Of half the laurels to his temples due  Th' Athenians arm delib'rate in whose train  Illustrious Medon ranks a faithful troop  His hundred Locrians Haliartus there  There Timon's few but gen'rous Delphians stand  By Aristides all enjoin'd to watch  Laconia's host That sternlytutor'd race  To passion cold he knew in action slow  In consultation torpid Anxious long  He waits and fears the eyelids of the morn  Too soon unclosing may too much reveal  Sicinus hast'ning to Laconia's camp  Finds all confus'd subordination lost  In altercation wond'rous in that breed  Of discipline and manners nor less strange  Than if the laws of nature in the sky  Dissolv'd should turn the moon and planets loose  From their accustom'd orbits to obey  The sun no longer When his first command  Pausanias issu'd for the march nor thought  Of disobedience to disturb his pride  One leader Amompharetus whose band  Of Pitanè rever'd him as the first  Among the brave refusal stern oppos'd  Protesting firm he never would retreat  Before Barbarians Aemnestus swift  Callicrates and others long approv'd  In arms entreat the Spartan to submit  Nor disconcert the salutary plan  Of gen'ral council Sullen he replies  Not of that council I will ne'er disgrace  The Spartan name But all the Greeks withdrawn  Expect our junction at Saturnia's dome  Callicrates and Aemnestus plead  Would'st thou expose thy countrymen to face  Unaided yonder multitude of Medes  Untry'd by us in combat Yes rejoins  The pertinacious man ere yield to flight  His troop applauded Now contention harsh  Resounded high exhausting precious hours  The Spartan march retarding when arriv'd  Sicinus witness to the wild debate  At length Pausanias knit his haughty brow  At Amompharetus and spake Weak man  Thou art insane The chastisement thy due  Our time allows not Instant march or stay  Behind and perish In his twofold grasp  The restive Spartan lifting from the ground  A pond'rous stone before the gen'ral's feet  Plac'd it and thus Against dishonest flight  From strangers vile I rest my suffrage there  Nor will forsake it To Sicinus turn'd  Pausanias Tell th' Athenians what thou see'st  I by Cithaeron's side to Juno's fane  Am hast'ning charge their phalanx to proceed  Sicinus back to Aristides flies  His ready phalanx from the lines he draws  Wing'd with his horse and bowmen yet his course  Suspends at Sparta's camp There sullen fix'd  Like some old oak's deeprooted knotted trunk  Which hath endur'd the tempestbreathing months  Of thrice a hundred winters yet remains  Unshaken there amidst his silent troop  Sat Amompharetus To him the sage  Unwise though brave transgressing all the laws  Of discipline though Spartan born and train'd  Arise o'ertake thy gen'ral and rejoin  Thy country's mercy by some rare exploit  Win to forgive thy capital default  Excess of courage Where Pausanias arm'd  With pow'r unlimited in war where all  The Spartan captains in persuasion fail'd  Requir'd not less than Jove himself or Jove  In Aristides to prevail Uprose  The warrior late inflexible yet slow  In strictest regularity of march  Led his wellorder'd files Correcting thus  The erring Spartan Aristides swept  Across the plain to fill the gen'ral host  Not yet the twilight harbinger of morn  Had overcome the stars The Persian scouts  Who rang'd abroad observing that no sound  Was heard no watchword through the Grecian lines  Adventur'd nigh and found an empty space  Swift they appris'd Mardonius who had form'd  His whole array Encircled by his chiefs  Greek and Barbarian first he gave command  That ev'ry hand provide a blazing torch  To magnify his terrors and with light  Facilitate pursuit then gladsome thus  Address'd his friends of Thessaly and Thebes  Now Larissaean Thorax and the rest  Of Aleuadian race now Theban lords  Judge of the Spartans justly Vaunted high  For unexampled prowess them you saw  First change their place imposing on the sons  Of Athens twice the formidable task  To face my chosen Persians next they gave  To my defiance no reply and last  Are fled before me Can your augurs shew  A better omen than a foe dismay'd  But kind allies to you my friendly care  Shall now be prov'd These thunderbolts of war  As you esteem them will Mardonius chuse  For his opponents Level your attack  Entire against th' Athenians None I dread  Yet by the sun less terrible to me  Is that Pausanias head of Sparta's race  Than Aristides Him Masistius lov'd  If you o'erthrow preserve him in the name  Of your own gods I charge you Mithra shine  On me no longer if in grateful warmth  Confessing ev'ry benefit receiv'd  I do not clasp that guardian of my friend  Now Persians mount your bold Nisaean steeds  Alert your targets grasp your lances poise  The word is Cyrus Royal spirit look  On me deriv'd from thy illustrious blood  Yet not in me illustrious if this day  My hand or courage faint Look down on these  Sons of thy matchless veterans The fire  Which at thy breath o'erspread the vanquish'd East  Light in their offs'pring that the loud report  Of their achievements on Asopian banks  Far as the floods of Ganges may proclaim  The western world a vassal to thy throne  He said and spurr'd his courser Through the ford  He dashes follow'd by th' impetuous speed  Of tall equestrian bands in armour scal'd  With gold on trappings of embroider'd gloss  Superbly seated Persians next and Medes  Advance an infantry select whose mail  Brightgilt or silver'd o'er augments the light  Of sparkling brands innumerably wav'd  By nations plunging through the turbid flood  In tumult rude emblazing as they pass  The skies the waters and with direst howl  Distracting both Like savage wolves they rush  As with ferocious fangs to rend the Greeks  To gnaw their flesh and satiate in their blood  The greedy thirst of massacre In chief  Here Mindarus commands by Midias join'd  And Tiridates powerless all to curb  Much more to marshal such Barbarian throngs  Which like a tumbling tide on level strands  When new the moon impels it soon o'erwhelm'd  Th' Asopian mead or like the mightier surge  When ireful Neptune strikes the ocean's bed  Profound Upheav'd the bottom lifts and rolls  A ridge of liquid mountains o'er th' abodes  Of some offending nation while the heav'ns  With coruscation red his brother Jove  Inflames and rocks with thunder's roar the poles  Th' auxiliar Greeks compact and silent march  In strength five myriads In arrangement just  The foot by Leontiades the wings  Of horse by Thorax and Emathia's king  Were led Now long before th' unwieldy mass  Of his disorder'd multitude advanc'd  Mardonius rushing through the vacant lines  Of Lacedaemon tow'rds Cithaeron bent  His swift career Faint rays began to streak  The third clear morning of that fruitful month  The last in summer's train Immortal day  Which all the Muses consecrate to fame  O thou exalted o'er the laurell'd train  High as the sweet Calliopè is thron'd  Above her sisters on the tuneful mount  O father hear Great Homer let one ray  From thy celestial light an humble son  Of thine illuminate lest freedom mourn  Her chosen race dishonour'd in these strains  Thou too my eldest brother who enjoy'st  The paradise thy genius hath portray'd  Propitious smile Lend vigour to a Muse  Who in her love of freedom equals thine  But to sustain her labours from thy store  Must borrow language sentiment and verse  Cithaeron's ridge from where Asopus rose  Stretch'd to Plataea with a southern fence  Confining one broad level which the floods  From their Hesperian head in eastward flow  Meandring parted O'er the mountain's foot  His course Pausanias destin'd where the soil  Abrupt and stony might the dread career  Of Persia's cavalry impede His ranks  Accompany'd by Tegea's faithful breed  Had measur'd now ten furlongs of their march  Half o'er the plain to reach the friendly ground  Then halted near an Eleusinian dome  Of Ceres thence they mov'd but timely first  Were join'd by Amompharetus At length  The chosen track was gain'd Pausanias cast  His eyes below first northward and survey'd  Between the river and his empty camp  A blaze involving all the plain The yell  Of mouths Barbarian of unnumber'd feet  Th' impetuous tread which crush'd the groaning turf  The neigh of horses and their echoing hoofs  Th' insulting clash of shields and sabres shook  The theatre of mountains hollowvoic'd  Their cavities rebellow'd and enlarg'd  The hideous sound His eyes the orient dawn  Attracted next Saturnia's roof he view'd  But distant still around whose sacred walls  The firstdeparted Grecians stood in arms  Beneath widefloating banners wish'd more nigh  There was the Genius of Plataea seen  By fancy's ken a hov'ring mourner seen  O'er his renown'd but desolated seat  One mass of ruins mountainous He mark'd  Th' Athenians traversing the meads below  In full battalia Resolute sedate  Without one shield in disarray they mov'd  To join the gen'ral host Beyond the stream  In prospect rose the battlements of Thebes  Whose sons perfidious but in battle firm  With phalanges of other hostile Greeks  Spread on the bank and menace to surmount  The shallow current for some dire attempt  To Aemnestus marching by his side  Pausanias turns the army he commands  To halt while mast'ring all unmanly fear  His haughty phlegm serenely thus fulfils  A leader's function Spartan we in vain  Precipitate our junction with allies  At Juno's distant fane the hour is past  The Pitanēan mutineer the cause  Seest thou yon Persian squadrons They precede  The whole Barbarian multitude The storm  Is gath'ring nigh we sep'rate must abide  The heavy weight of this unequal shock  Unless th' Athenians still in sight impart  A present aid A herald swift he sends  To Aristides with this weighty charge  "All Greece is now in danger and the blood  "Of Hercules in me Athenian help  "Is wanted here their missileweapon'd force"  Last he address'd Tisamenus Provide  The sacrifice for battleWarriors form  Slain is the victim but th' inspecting seer  Reveals no sign propitious Now full nigh  The foremost Persian horse discharge around  Their javelins darts and arrows Sparta's chief  In calm respect of inauspicious heav'n  Directs each soldier at his foot to rest  The passive shield submissive to endure  Th' assault and watch a signal from the gods  A second time unfavorable prove  The victim's entrails Unremitted show'rs  Of pointed arms distribute wounds and death  Oh discipline of Sparta Patient stands  The wounded soldier sees a comrade fall  Yet waits permission from his chief to shield  His own or brother's head Among the rest  Callicrates is pierc'd a mortal stroke  His throat receives Him celebrate O muse  Him in historic rolls deliver'd down  To admiration of remotest climes  Through latest ages These expiring words  Beyond Olympian chaplets him exalt  Beyond his palms in battle Not to die  For Greece but dying ere my sword is drawn  Without one action worthy of my name  I grieve He said and fainting on the breast  Of Aemnestus breath'd in spouting blood  His last departing thy attendant meet  Leonidas in regions of the bless'd  A second victim bleeds the gath'ring foes  To multitude are grown the show'rs of death  Increase then melted into flowing grief  Pausanian pride He tow'rds the fane remote  Of Juno lifting his afflicted

From stern controul of Lacedaemon's laws  No longer waits inactive but his band  Leads forth and firmly checks th' insulting foe  The sacrifice is prosp'rous and the word  For gen'ral onset by Pausanias giv'n  Then as a lion from his native range  Confin'd a captive long if once his chain  He breaks with mane erect and eyes of fire  Asserts his freedom rushing in his strength  Resistless forth so Sparta's phalanx turns  A face tremendous on recoiling swarms  Of squadron'd Persians who to Ceres' fane  Are driv'n But there Mardonius like the god  Of thunders ranging o'er th' ethereal vault  Thick clouds on clouds impregnated with storms  His chosen troops embattles Bows and darts  Rejecting gallantly to combat close  They urge undaunted efforts and to death  Their ground maintain in courage or in might  Not to the Greeks inferior but in arms  In discipline and conduct Parties small  Or single warriors here with vigour wield  The battleax and sabre others rush  Among the spears to wrench away or break  By strength of hands the weapons of their foes  But fiercest was the contest where sublime  The son of Gobryas from a snowwhite steed  Shot terror There selected warriors charg'd  A thousand vet'rans by their fathers train'd  Who shar'd renown with Cyrus On the right  Close to his gen'ral's side Briareus grasp'd  A studded mace Pangaeus on the left  Nam'd from a Thracian hill The bristly front  Of Sparta's phalanx with intrepid looks  Mardonius fac'd and thunder'd out these words  Come twicedefy'd Pausanias if thou hear'st  Thy Spartan prowess on Mardonius try  Pausanias heard but shunn'd retorting words  In saturnine disdain laconic thus  His men addressing Yours the soldier's part  The gen'rals mine advance not but receive  These loose Barbarians on your steady points  Not one of Persia's breed though early train'd  So strong a javelin as Mardonius lanc'd  Or in its aim so true Three brothers grac'd  The foremost line of Sparta natives all  Of sweet Amyclae all in age and arms  Mature their splendid lineage from the stock  Of Tyndarus deriving Them on earth  Three javelins whirl'd successive laid supine  An effort of Mardonius Three in rank  Behind partake the same resistless doom  Three bold companions in the hardy chace  Of boars on green Taÿgetus Supply'd  With weapons new the phalanx still to gore  He perseveres unweary'd not unlike  Some irritated porcupine of size  Portentous darting his envenom'd quills  Through each assailant In Laconia's front  So many warriors and their weapons fall'n  Leave in her triple tire of pointed steel  A void for swift impression of her foes  In rush Briareus and Pangaeus huge  Whose maces send fresh numbers to the shades  The op'ning widens On his vaulting steed  Mardonius follows like ensanguin'd Mars  By his auxiliars grim dismay and rage  Preceded Rivalling the lightning's beams  The hero's sabre bright and rapid wheels  Aloft in air A comet thus inflames  The cheek of night pale mortals view in dread  Th' unwonted lustre transient tho' it be  Among the lights of heav'n Pausanias rous'd  Advancing at Briareus points his lance  Meantime six Spartans of the younger class  Assail Mardonius One his bridle grasp'd  The Persian sabre at the shoulder close  Lopp'd off th' audacious arm Another stoop'd  To seize the chieftain's foot and drag him down  Pois'd on his stirrup he in sunder smote  The Spartan's waist Another yet approach'd  Who at a blow was cloven to the chin  Two more the gen'rous horse uprearing dash'd  Maim'd and disabled to the ground the last  His teeth disfigur'd and his weight oppress'd  As some tallmasted ship on ev'ry side  Assail'd by pinnaces and skiffs whose strength  Is number drives her welldirected prow  Through all their feeble clusters while her chief  Elate contemplates from her lofty deck  The hostile keels upturn'd and floating dead  Where'er she steers victorious so the steed  Nisaean tramples on Laconian slain  Triumphant so Mardonius from his seat  Looks down But fate amidst his triumph shews  Briareus yielding to a forceful blow  Of stern Pausanias and Pangaeus pierc'd  By Amompharetus Their giant bulks  Thrown prostrate crash three longprotended rows  Of Spartan spears Widebranching thus huge oaks  By age decay'd or twisted from the roots  By rending whirlwinds in their pond'rous fall  Lay desolate the under shrubs and trees  Of young unstable growth More awful still  Another object strikes the satrap's eye  With nodding plumes and formidable stride  Lo Aemnestus Asia's gen'ral feels  Emotions now which trouble not degrade  His gen'rous spirit Not as Priam's son  On sight of dire Achilles thoughts of flight  Possess Mardonius but to wait the foe  And if to die with honour die if live  Enjoy a life of fame His giant guard  Around him close one levels at the casque  Of Aemnestus but the weighty mace  Slides o'er the Spartan's slanting shield and spends  Its rage in dust The stooping giant leaves  His flank unguarded and admits a stroke  Which penetrates the entrails Down he sinks  Another tow'r of Asia's battle strewn  In hideous ruin Soon a second bleeds  A third a fourth The fifth in posture stands  To crush the victor with a blow wellaim'd  Him Menalippus at the brawny pit  Of his uplifted arm transpiercing deep  Disables Aemnestus struggles long  To grapple with his victim and invokes  Leonidas aloud The active son  Of Gobryas plants throughout the Spartan shield  A wood of Javelins His Nisaean horse  Careering vaulting with his fangs and hoofs  Protects his lord The guards who still furviv'd  With faithful zeal their whole united strength  Exert unwearied for a lib'ral chief  Some paces backward Aemnestus forc'd  Impels his heel against a loos'ning stone  Broad craggy scarce inferior to the weight  Discharg'd by Hector on the massy bars  Of Agamemnon's camp The Spartan quick  From his left arm removes the heavy shield  With javelins thick transfix'd From earth he lifts  The casual weapon and with caution marks  The fatal time and distance O'er the heads  Of thy surrounding guard the fragment hurl'd  Descends Mardonius on thy manly chest  And lays thee o'er thy courser's back supine  Without sensation O illustrious man  Whose dazzling virtues through thy frailties beam'd  Magnanimous heroic gen'rous pure  In friendship warm in gratitude This doom  At once dissolves all interval of pain  To mind or body Not a moment more  Hast thou ingenuous satrap to repine  Or grieve Go hero thy Masistius greet  Where no ambition agitates the breast  No gloomy veil of superstition blinds  No friend can die no battle can be lost  This fall to Greece decisive as to heav'n  Enceladus o'erthrown when thunderpierc'd  He under Aetna's torrid mass was chain'd  Discomfits Asia's hopes In fresh array  Meantime the phalanx by Pausanias form'd  Proceeds entire Facility of skill  Directs their weapons pace by pace they move  True to the cadence of accustom'd notes  From gentle flutes which trill the Doric lays  Of Alcman and Terpander Slow they gain  The ground which Persia quits till Chileus bold  With his Tegaeans gores the hostile flanks  Confusion then and gen'ral rout prevail  The fugitives proclaim Mardonius slain  The whole Barbarian multitude disperse  In blind dismay cool Mindarus in vain  Attempts to check their flight all seek the camp  And now the Spartan flutes combin'd with shouts  Of loud Tegaeans stimulate his speed  Across the ford His trenches he regains  And there to Midias Tiridates brave  And chosen satraps gath'ring at his call  Thus spake The flow'r of Asia in the dust  Reclines his glories Feel your loss like me  Not overcome by sorrow or surprise  At changes natural to man the sport  Of his own passions and uncertain chance  Vicissitudes of fortune I have prov'd  One day been foil'd a conqueror the next  In arduous actions though experienc'd minds  Have much to fear not less of hope remains  To animate the brave Amid this storm  The throne of Cyrus your exalted sires  Your own nobility recall deserve  The rank you hold occasion now presents  For such a trial To uphold my king  My country's name and piously revenge  My kindred blood newspilt my sword my arm  My life I destine Multitude is left  Surpassing twenty myriads ev'n despair  Befriends us famine threat'ning and the dread  Of merciless resentment in our foes  May force these rally'd numbers to obtain  From their own swords relief Behold your camp  Strongfenc'd and bulwark'd by Masistian care  A present refuge See th' auxiliar Greeks  Entire advancing on th' inferior bands  Of Athens Still may Xerxes o'er the West  Extend his empire and regret no part  Of this disaster but Mardonius slain  Assume your posts for stern defence provide  End of the Twentyninth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the THIRTIETH  O God of light and wisdom thee the Muse  Once more addresses Thou didst late behold  The Salaminian brine with Asian blood  Discolour'd Climbing now the steep ascent  To thy meridian for a stage of war  More horrible and vast thy beaming eye  Prepare Thou over wide Plataea's field  Chang'd to a crimson lake shall drive thy car  Nor see a pause to havoc till the West  In his dark chamb rs shuts thy radiant face  Now had the herald to Cecropia's chief  Sent by Pausanias in his name requir'd  Immediate aid No doubt suspends the haste  Of Aristides who arrays his ranks  With cordial purpose to sustain that strength  Of Greece Laconia's phalanx Lo in sight  New clouds of battle hov'ring He discerns  Th' array of Leontiades with wings  Of Macedonic and Thessalian horse  Then calls Sicinus Friend he said observe  Robust and bold to perfidy inur'd  Not less than arms yon Thebans cross our march  I trust the justice of our cause will foil  Them thrice our number but events like this  Are not in man's disposal If I fall  Not rashly good Sicinus rest assur'd  Themistocles survives The gate of Greece  He guards Euboea and Thessalia holds  Those granaries of plenty Eastern shores  With all his force perhaps victorious now  Xanthippus will relinquish and maintain  The sea auxiliar to thy prudent lord  Thus all be well though Aristides bleeds  This to Themistocles report But go  Fly to Cleander him and all the Greeks  Rouse from the fane of Juno to the field  Both Spartans and Athenians want their aid  Thy tribe undaunted Cimon place behind  Olympiodorus if his active bands  Repel Thessalia's horse avoid pursuit  Wheel on the flank of Thebes Here Delphi's priest  Behold Emathia's standards front thy right  With Haliartus and Oileus' son  Let me be station'd there I trust the spouse  Of Amarantha at her father's sight  Will sheath a sword unvoluntary drawn  Nor ties of hospitality and blood  Profane to serve Barbarians I accept  The gen'rous offer sage and gallant seer  Spake Aristides In that wing thy friend  The learn'd and manly Aesehylus presides  But to thy god appealing I enjoin  Thy rev'rend head to cover in retreat  Its unpolluted hairs should fire of youth  Or yet more strong necessity impel  Thy son to battle Here th' enraptur'd priest  The inspiration of my god I feel  A glorious day to Athens I presage  I see her laurels fresh Apollo joins  His sister Pallas to preserve a race  Which all the Muses love His awful power  Will chain the monster parricide and rouse  The Grecian worth in Alexander's heart  These animated accents fire the line  Within the measure of an arrow's flight  Each army now rank'd opposite A thought  Of piety and prudence from his place  Mov'd Aristides Single he advanc'd  Between the hosts offensive arms he left  Behind him ev'n his plumed helm resign'd  Gave to his placid looks their lib'ral flow  Before him hung his ample shield alone  Timothea's gift whose sculptur'd face display'd  Truth equity and wisdom hand in hand  As in his breast Exalting high in tone  His gracious voice he thus adjur'd his foes  Ye men deriv'd from Cadmus who in Greece  Establish'd letters fruitful mother since  Of arts and knowledge to Barbarian spoil  This hour expos'd ye sons of Locris hear  Thessalians Phocians Dorians all compell'd  By savage force to arm against your friends  Of language rites and manners with your own  Congenial Aristides in the name  Of all the Grecian deities invokes  Your own sensations to disarm your hands  Of impious weapons which retard the help  We bear to those now struggling in defence  Of Grecian freedom sepulchres and fanes  He said was heard like Enoch like the man  Who walk'd with God when eminently wise  Among th' obscene the violent and false  Of justice and religion truth and peace  He spake exploded and from menac'd death  To God withdrew The fell Boeotians rend  The sky with threat'ning clamour and their spears  Shake in defiance while the word to charge  Perfidious Leontiades conveys  Retreating backward Aristides cloaths  His face in terror So Messiah chang'd  His countenance serene when full of wrath  Bent on Satanic enemies who shook  Heav'n's peaceful champaign with rebellious arms  He grasp'd ten thousand thunders and infix'd  Plagues in their souls while darts of piercing fire  Through their immortal substances by sin  Susceptible of pain his glaring wheels  Shot forth pernicious Aristides leads  His phalanx on Now Greeks to Greeks oppose  Their steely structures of tremendous war  With equal spears and shields their torrent fronts  They clash together like the justling rocks  Symplegades Cyanean at the mouth  Of Thracia's foaming Bosphorus were feign'd  Infrangible opponents to sustain  A mutual shock which tempested the frith  Dividing Europe from the Orient world  Meanwhile Phoebean Timon's glowing zeal  Replete with patriot and religious warmth  Thus in the wing which Aeschylus had form'd  Bespake the encircling chieftains O'er the space  Between Asopus and the main array  Of Thebes I see the Macedonian horse  But half advanc'd Their tardy pace denotes  Reluctance Lo I meditate an act  To prove my zeal for universal Greece  Her violated altars and the tombs  Robb'd of their precious dust My slender band  So long companions in adventures high  With your choice Locrians Haliartus join  To Medon's banner Aeschylus observe  My progress if my piety succeeds  Thou as a soldier take advantage full  So saying o'er the plain in solemn pace  His rev'rend form he moves by snowy bands  Pontifical around his plumed helm  Distinguish'd Thus from Salem's holy gate  Melchisedek the priest of him Most High  Went forth to meet and benedictions pour  On Terah's son in Shaveh's royal vale  The Macedonian squadrons at the sight  Fall back in rev'rence their dismounting prince  So wills The father and the son embrace  Oh Amarantha's husband joyful sighs  The parent Oh my Amarantha's sire  In equal joy the husband Timon then  A Greek in blood to Delphi's priest ally'd  The god of Delphi's blessing now secure  Abandon these Barbarians to the fate  Which in the name of Phoebus I denounce  For his insulted temple and the rape  Of Amarantha from Minerva's shrine  Yet to unsheath an unsuspected sword  Against them neither I nor heav'n require  Less thy own honour but repass the stream  Amid this blind uproar unnotic'd seek  Thermopylae again and reach thy realm  O'er all that clime Themistocles prevails  My friend his present amity obtain  Cecropia's future love nor hazard more  Thy fame and welfare Aristides knows  My truth replies the monarch now to thee  Obedience prompt a second proof shall yield  Ascend a steed to Amarantha's arms  I will conduct thee first th' auspicious flight  Of both a father shall assist and bless  They speed away in extasy the sire  To clasp his darling child in Dirce's grove  This pass'd in Medon's eye who watchful stood  With Haliartus and a troop advanc'd  In care for Timon When apparent now  The Macedonian squadrons quit the field  Of strife the heavycuirass'd of his wing  With serry'd shields by Aeschylus is led  In evolution wheeling on the flanks  Of that strong mass'd battalia which compos'd  The hostile center First in phalanx stood  Unwilling Locrians Medon lifts his voice  And to each eye abash'd his awful shape  Like some reproving deity presents  They hear they see Oïleus in his son  As ris'n a mourning witness of their shame  From his sepulchral bed The banners drop  Before him down their spears and bucklers fall  They break disperse and fly with children's fear  When by authority's firm look surpris'd  In some attempt forbidden or unmeet  Boeotian files are next With sudden wheel  They form a front and dauntless wait the assault  Still in the van robust and martial Thebes  Unbroken stems th' agility and skill  Of her opponent Athens Long unspent  The tide of wellconducted battle flows  Without decision strong At length by fate  Is Leontiades impell'd to meet  Cecropia's chief where Thebes began to feel  His mighty pressure Whether justice strung  His nerves with force beyond a guilty hand  Or of his manly limbs the vigour match'd  His fortitude of mind his falchion clove  Down to the neck that faithless Greek of Greece  The most malignant foe The treacherous deed  Which laid fair Thespia with Plataean tow'rs  In dust he thus aton'd A bolt from heav'n  Thus rives an oak whose top divided hangs  On either side obliquely from the trunk  Murichides the Hellespontin bleeds  Too zealous friend of Asia in whose cause  This day he arm'd By great Mardonius charg'd  Late messenger of friendship he in peace  On Salaminian shores had touch'd the hand  Which now amid the tumult pierc'd his heart  Not willingly if known Then Lynceus fell  From Oedipēan Polynices sprung  The last remains of that illfated house  Mironides and Clinias near the side  Of Aristides fought his strong support  Yet undismay'd and firm three hundred chiefs  Or sons of proudest families in Thebes  Dispute the victory till death Meantime  Olympiodorus from the left had gall'd  Thessalia's squadrons like a sleety storm  Checking their speed Athenian horse though few  Mix'd with their bowmen well maintain'd their ground  His own truelevell'd shaft transfix'd the throat  Of Larissean Thorax who in dust  Buries at length his Aleuadian pride  Rememb'ring all his charge bold Cimon rears  His mighty spear Impetuous through a band  Of yielding Phocians he on Theban ranks  Falls like a rapid falcon when his weight  Precipitates to strike the helpless prey  Him slaughter follows slaughter from the right  On Aeschylus attends and mightier waits  On Aristides Justice in his breast  Awhile was blind to mercy undeserv'd  Ev'n unimplor'd by persevering foes  Invet'rate Now on this empurpled stage  Of vengeance due to perfidy and crimes  Twice their own number had the Athenians heap'd  Of massacred Boeotians but as heav'n  Not to destruction punishing restrains  Its anger just and oft the harden'd spares  That time may soften or that suff'rings past  Not measur'd full may turn the dread of more  To reformation Aristides thus  Relenting bade retreat be sounded loud  Then by th' obedient host surrounded spake  Serene Enough of Grecian blood is spilt  Ye men of Athens low in dust are laid  The heads of those who plann'd the fall of Greece  The populace obtuse resembling you  Enlighten'd people as the sluggish beast  A gen'rous courser let your pity save  In gratitude to Jove creating yours  Unlike Boeotia's breedNow form again  Thus equity and mercy he combin'd  Like that archangel authoris'd by heav'n  Chief o'er celestial armies when the fall'n  From purity and faith in Eden's bow'rs  Not to perdition nor despair he left  Abandon'd Aristides still proceeds  New victories invite you Sparta long  Hath wanted succour Men of Athens march  Lo Menalippus greets in rapid haste  This more than hero I am come he said  To bring thee tidings of Mardonius slain  In open fight Pausanias still demands  Thy instant presence In pursuit he reach'd  The stream "Not now that passage is forbid"  Tisamenus exclaim'd The gen'ral pass'd  In vain to force the welldefended camp  Repuls'd in ev'ry part he dubious stands  With disappointment fore on Attic skill  To mount entrenchments and a rampart storm  Laconians and Tegaeans both depend  To crown the day Th' Athenian heard and cool  In four divisions separates the host  Four thousand warriors light and heavyarm'd  Each part compose whose ensigns o'er the flood  In order just are carry'd He attains  Th' adjacent field and joins Pausanias there  Whose ravell'd brow and countenance of gloom  Present a lion's grimness who some fold  Or stall attempting thence by vollied stones  Of trooping shepherds and of herdsmen chas'd  Hath sullenly retreated though oppress'd  By famine dire To Aristides spake  With haughtiness redoubled Sparta's chief  Didst thou forget Athenian who commands  The Grecian armies Thou hast loiter'd long  Since my two mandates With majestic warmth  The righteous man Pausanias now receive  From Aristides language new but just  Thine is the pride of satraps not the light  Ingenuous vanity of Greeks from sense  Of freedom sense of cultivated minds  Above the rest of mortals No a black  Barbaric humour festers at thy heart  Portending usurpation Know proud man  Thou hast been weigh'd and long deficient found  By Aristides thy superior far  Then most superior when for public good  Compliant most Thou soon O Spartan born  Yet in thy country's decency untaught  Will like a Persian cast a loathing eye  On freedom on Lycurgus and his laws  Which gall a mind despotic I presage  Thee dangerous Pausanias Where the seeds  Of dark ambition I suspect my eye  Becomes a jealous centinel beware  Nor force my active vigilance to proof  Now or in future when united Greece  No more defensive may retaliate war  Successful war which prompts aspiring thoughts  Rest now a safe spectator From defeat  Of real warriors of our fellow Greeks  Not Persians lightly arm'd in loose array  The loiterers of Athens shall with ease  Surmount that fence impregnable to thee  To wait an answer he disdain'd but march'd  While arrogance in secret gnash'd the teeth  Of this darkminded Spartan doom'd to prove  The boding words of Aristides true  The sun no longer vertical began  His slant Hesperian progress At the head  Of his own host Cecropia's chief began  Enthusiastic flame without whose aid  The soldier patriot and the bard is faint  At this great crisis thus inspires the man  Of human race the most correct in mind  Ye shades of all who tyrants have expell'd  Ye who repose at Marathon entomb'd  Ye glorious victims who exalt the name  Of Salamis and Manes of the brave  Leonidas arise Our banners fan  With your Elysian breath Thou god supreme  Jove elutherian send thy child belov'd  With her Gorgonian aegis to defend  A people struggling not for spoil or pow'r  Not to extend dominion but maintain  The right of nature thy peculiar gift  To dignify mankind I lift this prayer  My citizens in rev'rence not in doubt  Of your success Ye vanquishers of Greeks  Beneath your spears yon servile herd will fall  As corn before the sickle With a look  Of circumspection he remark'd a swell  Of ground not fifty paces from the camp  Olympiodorus and his bowmen there  He posted first Now Aeschylus he said  Construct of solid shields a brazen roof  In contact close to yonder fence of wood  Form like the tortoise in his massy shell  The archers each like Phoebus skill'd remove  With show'rs of death the thick defendants soon  Clear from the rampart which in height surpass'd  Two cubits Aeschylus not slow performs  His task A rank of sixty warriors plac'd  Erect with cov'ring bucklers o'er their heads  A brazen platform to the wall unites  The next in order stoop behind the last  Kneel firm on earth O'er implicated shields  A stable passage thus when Cimon sees  He mounts and fearless eyes the Asian camp  Between the rampart's basis and the foe  An empty space observing on the ground  His spear he fixes and amidst a storm  Of clatt'ring javelins arrows darts and stones  Swings down So shooting from the sulph'rous lap  Of some darkvested cloud a globe of fire  Through winds and rain precipitates a blaze  Terrific down the raven pall of night  His whole division follows with his band  Myronides and Aeschylus releas'd  From his first care Successively they range  The very fence by Persian toil uprais'd  Now from the Persian multitude secures  Th' Athenian near No obstacle remains  To Aristides who compleats his plan  Olympiodorus and his active train  With axes keen and cleaving spades approach  Hewn down uptorn in that surmounted part  The fall'n defences and the levell'd ground  Soon leave an op'ning wide His strong reserve  Eight thousand light two thousand heavyarm'd  With Haliartus and Oileus' son  Cecropia's chief leads forward to sustain  His first bold warriors Chileus enters next  With his Tegaeans Aemnestus brave  Pausanias Amompharetus the youth  Of Menalippus all the Spartan host  Seven Grecian myriads through the breach invade  A ground with swarms of tents and men oppress'd  Dire thus th' irruption of Germanic seas  Through strong Batavian mounds th' inflated brine  Stupendous piles of longresisting weight  Bears down and baffling strength and art combin'd  Foams o'er a country in its seat profound  Below the surface of th' endang'ring main  A country where frugality and toil  No spot leave waste no meadow but in herds  Redundant where the num'rous dwellings shew  Simplicity but plenty now immers'd  With all their throng'd inhabitants beneath  Th' unsparing deluge Aristides swift  As if by gen'ral choice the chief supreme  Commandment issues that to either side  The host extend that skirted by the fence  With wheeling flanks in front the line assume  A crescent's figure Thus the fisher skill'd  With his capacious seines slowdragg'd and press'd  Close on each bank a river's whole expanse  With all his natives glossyfinn'd involves  Yet Mindarus with Mede and Persian ranks  A large remainder from the morning fight  Resists which soon are slaughter'd he retreats  Among the tents whose multitude impedes  The Grecians Aristides straight commands  That from the heavy line's disjointed length  A hundred bands expatiate in the chace  Of foes benumb'd by fear who neither fight  Nor fly of means depriv'd The carnage grows  In every quarter Fountains seem unclos'd  Whence rivulets of blood o'erflow the ground  O'er satraps potentates and princes fall'n  Strode Aristides first of men of heav'n  The imitator in his civil deeds  Now some faint semblance far as mortal may  Of that Almighty victor on the field  Ethereal when o'er helms and helmed heads  Of prostrate seraphim and powers o'erthrown  He rode Still Mindarus by courage wing'd  From nation flies to nation still persists  Exhorting though in hopeless thought he sees  Great Hyperanthes from the shades ascend  And seems to hear the godlike phantom sigh  In mournful words like these Ah fruitless toil  As once was mine to rescue from despair  The panic fears of Asia Dead in mind  Her host already soon dead clay must lie  Like me on Oeta's rock Yet Midias brave  With Tiridates rous'd their efforts join  Against them warlike Medon and the seed  Of Lygdamis chance brings They side by side  As heretofore Thermopylae beheld  Young Dithyrambus and Diomedon  Had all the day their unresisted wedge  Of Locrian shields and Delphian led to deeds  Accumulating trophies Midias falls  By Haliartus From the slain his lance  Recov'ring tow'rds his patron dear he turns  Him conqu'ror too of Tiridates views  In joy joy soon to sorrow chang'd Fate guides  A casual weapon from a distant hand  Such as at Ramoth from the Syrian bow  Drawn at a venture smote between the joints  Of harness strong the Israelitish king  Who from the fight bade wheel his chariot stain'd  With his own crimson Ponderous and broad  The hostile lance inflicts a mortal wound  In Medon's gen'rous bosom Not a sigh  He breathes in look still placid and sedate  While death's cold moisture stagnates on his limbs  By all their pow'rs forsaken Bear he said  To Haliartus bear me from the camp  Nor yet extract the weapon life I feel  Would follow swift and Medon hath a charge  Yet to deliver Some pathetic Muse  In tend'rest measures give these numbers flow  Let thine who plaintive on the pontic verge  In servitude Sarmatian through her page  Of sorrows weeps thy banishment from Rome  Or thine Euripides whose moral strains  Melt sympathy in tears at human woes  Thy vary'd tragic themes or both unite  Your inspiration to describe a heart  Where gratitude o'er all affections dear  Predominantly sway'd the faithful heart  Of Haliartus at this sudden stroke  Of direful chance To death is Medon snatch'd  From glory snatch'd amid victorious friends  The Carian's bosom instant feels combin'd  Achilles' anguish at Patroclus dead  The pang of Priam at the fall of Troy  Ev'n woman's grief Andromache's distress  For her slain Hector and his mother's pain  To see his mangled and dishonour'd corse  Great Artemisia's name th' illustrious blood  From Lygdamis deriv'd his own exploits  Of recent fame are all eras'd from thought  In Haliartus now who sinks again  To Meliboeus On the wounded chief  As on his lord his patron still he looks  With all th' affection of a menial bred  In the same home and cherish'd in that home  With lib'ral kindness to his humbler state  He clasps the fainting hero on the shields  Of weeping friends deposits and conveys  Swift through a portal from its hinges forc'd  Three hours remain'd to Phoebus in his course  Close by the entrenchment under beachen shade  Of ancient growth a fountain bursts in rills  Transparent thither on the down of moss  Was Medon borne and laid Unloose he said  My helm and fill from that refreshing stream  Obey'd he drank a part then pouring down  The remnant spake By this libation clear  Be testified my thanks to all the gods  That I have liv'd to see my country sav'd  On this victorious day My fate requires  No lamentation Haliartus dear  Oh more than kindred dear Commend me first  To Aristides Medon's parting breath  Him victor hails To Delphi's virtuous priest  To my Leonteus to the glorious son  Of Neocles my salutation bear  To kind Cleander my Troezenian host  To Hyacinthus of Euboea's race  The flower of all her chieftains They have prov'd  In me some zeal their island to redeem  Transport my ashes to Melissa's care  Them near the reliques of Laconia's king  Repose be mine the neighbour of his urn  Here with an utmost effort of his voice  With arms extended and Elysian look  Leonidas the life thy friendship sav'd  An off'ring to thy manes now I close  Mature in age to glory not unknown  Above the wish as destitute of hope  To find a fairer time or better cause  Than sends me now a messenger to greet  Thee with glad tidings of this land preserv'd  With his own hand the javelin from his breast  He draws serene life issues through the wound  New shouts new trumpets waken from a trance  Of grief the son of Lygdamis He sees  Cleander who th' Asopian banks had pass'd  Call'd by Sicinus from Saturnia's dome  Lo Epidaurian Clitophon the ranks  Of Phlius with Menander Sicyon's chief  Automedon the Hermionean spears  With Lycus follow Cephallene's sons  The Acarnanian all th' Epirot bands  Leprēan Conon with Mycenae's youth  Polydamas by Arimnestus led  The brave Plataeans with his Thespian files  Alcimedon Nearcus with his force  Of Chalcis Potidaean Tydeus next  Eretrian Cleon Lampon and the troop  Of little Styra Corinth's banners last  By Adimantus and Alcmaeon rang'd  Too late you come for glory them bespake  The Carian sad Lo half the foes destroy'd  By Aristides fugitives the rest  Lo there the only loss which Greece sustains  To him Cleander with devout regret  O'er Medon honour'd paranymph and guest  His head inclining Not too late we come  For sacrifice of Persians to the ghost  Of this dead hero Ah what floods of tears  Will fall in TroezenBut let grief prevail  Hereafter Son of Lygdamis renounce  Despondency Acanthè still survives  To fire thy breast as Ariphilia mine  I hear her prompting my vindictive arm  From thy experience of this glorious day  Lead thy Troezenian host where best to point  His strenuous efforts Let thy guiding zeal  For me long cursing my inactive post  Yet find one track to fame These gallant words  Of cordial frankness from dejection lift  The Carian brave not less than Phoebus cheer'd  The languid son of Priam on the bank  Of Xanthus when a stony mass of weight  To stay a keel on Hellespontine sands  By Ajax hurl'd benumb'd the Trojan's frame  Thus Haliartus Through that open gate  New forc'd the shortest safest passage lies  But to acquire some lustre I can shew  Another track for prowess yet to shine  He leads all follow save Corinthian bands  With Adimantus hast'ning through the gate  Soon as to him th' intelligence is brought  Who ent'ring sees a carnage which confounds  A timid spirit By Alcmaeon urg'd  Close by the fence he marches none he meets  But fly before him Adimantus lifts  His spear and satiates cowardice with blood  Of unresisting men By cheap success  Betray'd a distant quarter he attains  Where Mindarus confronts him From his steed  Th' unyielding satrap whirls a rapid lance  Which nails the base Corinthian to the ground  Alcmaeon next is wounded more had bled  But Aristides o'er that part devoid  Of tents his dreadful crescent in array  Is forming new The Persian starts he flies  To one last angle of the spacious camp  Sole spot unforc'd Half circled now in front  The Attic Spartan and Tegaean ranks  In motion slow yet moving on augment  Progressively their terrors like a range  Of clouds which thicken on the brow of night  A final wreck portending to a fleet  Already shatter'd by the morning storm  Round Mindarus the remnant of his host  Collected still is numerous Them he sees  Oft look behind a sight that ill accords  With warriors but as now in columns deep  Its glitt'ring horns that direful crescent shews  Within the limits of a javelin's cast  All turn intent on flight at large they break  Their own inclosure down whose late defence  Is present bane and intercepts escape  Lo Haliartus all whose grief is chang'd  To fire heroic flame Three myriads fresh  He pours that crouded angle he invests  Preventing flight Cleander looks around  Like some tornado menacing a bark  Which soon unseam'd and parted sinks ingulph'd  He finds a breach and with him enters death  The longenduring satrap whose mild soul  Calamity hath worn resembles now  The poor desponding sailor who is left  Last of the found'ring vessel on a plank  Alone No coast appears the greedy swell  He sees around expecting ev'ry wave  Will terminate his being and forgoes  All hope of succour His afflicted soul  Thus with an effort equal to his rank  The prince explores What Mindarus remains  For thee deserted In another's home  Cleora dwells Masistius is no more  Slain is Mardonius Asia's glory fall'n  Thou hast too long been fugitive this day  Like Teribazus close a term of woe  Like him in death be honour'd He dismounts  He grasps a spear Such dignity of shame  To Ilian Hector from his flight recall'd  Great Homer's Muse imparted While the prince  Is meditating thus a man sublime  Tow'rs from th' Athenians who suspend their march  Unlike the son of Peleus in his ire  Implacable he represents a god  In aspect god of mercy not of arms  Know chieftain he began to me the Greeks  One Persian life have granted it is thine  In this day's trial I have noted well  Thy constancy and manhood I who prize  The gems of virtue in whatever clime  O Persian whether in a friend or foe  Their neverchanging lustre they display  I Aristides my protecting arm  Extend Time presses yield thee ere too late  Captivity no burden shalt thou find  Till safe without a ransom thou regain  Thy native seat The Persian melts like snow  In all its rigour at the noontide sun  This unforeseen humane demeanour calms  His mind and hushes ev'ry desp'rate thought  He thus replies On all my actions past  Hath fortune frown'd perhaps a captive state  With Aristides whom Masistius lov'd  Mardonius prais'd and all mankind reveres  Forebodes a change of fortune to my gain  Thy condescending wisdom O supreme  In justice knowledge and benignant deeds  May lift a man of sorrows from despair  He yields Th' Athenian leads him through the press  Secure himself a spectacle avoids  Which others covet Lo on ev'ry side  Keen swords of massacre are wav'd To maids  Deflow'r'd dishonour'd wives and gods prophan'd  To Athens Thespia and Plataea burnt  The Greeks compleat their sacrifice The sun  Wont on those fields of glist'ning green to smile  And trace Asopus through his crystal maze  Now setting glances over lakes of blood  While fate with Persian carnage chafes the stream  No longer smooth and limpid but o'erswoln  And foaming purple with encreasing heaps  Of carcases and arms Night drops her shade  On thirty myriads slaughter'd Thus thy death  Leonidas of Sparta was aveng'd  Greece thus by Attic virtue was preserv'd  FINIS  ERRATA  B XXIII l  for
