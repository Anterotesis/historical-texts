 THE COBLER OR A Wife of Ten Thousand A BALLAD OPERA  IN TWO ACTS  AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL DRURYLANE  LONDON  Printed for T BECKET the Corner of the Adelphi in the Strand  Price ONE SHILLING  ADVERTISEMENT  THE hint of the subsequent trifle is taken from the  Blaise le Saveteir of Sedan  as is the hint of the Clubscene from an essay of Dr  Goldsmith  and if the indulgent public find a few passable airs and allow the dialogue to be worthy of filling the intervals which are necessary in musical pieces to set off the songs I trust they will overlook the pictures of low life I have in a manner considered myself obliged to draw as the proper subjects for ballads which unless they are familiar and have something like character and contrast 'tis next to impossibility but they must be dull and insipid  C Dibdin  Dramatis Personae  MEN  SNOB  Mr BANNISTER  NIPIKIN  Mr DIBDIN  FROTH  Mr PARSONS  WOMEN  ALICE  Mrs WRIGHTEN  Mrs NIPIKIN  Mrs LOVE  The COBLER  ACT I  The

Dolt  Both  This this I swear  Is more than I can bear  SNOB  Why you jade what do you prate atIsn't Saint Monday and are not the club waiting for me  ALICE  The clubYes indeed you need squander your substance among a parcel of raggamuffins 'till you bring yourself and your poor wife to a jail  SNOB  Why you impudent vixen are Master Muggins Joey Jenkins and Gaffer Grumble raggamuffins Is the pimplenos'd Exciseman a raggamuffin or are little Hone the barber Lawyer Pest and Mr Confusion the surgeon raggamuffins But I don't know what's come to you since you have had the credit of being a tradesman's wife  ALICE  O yes great credit to be sure Don't Mrs Marmalade the 'Squire's housekeeper and every one of the other gentlefolks that I am acquainted with turn up their noses and don't they cry only think that such a comely young woman and one that has been so genteelly edicated should throw herself away upon such a fellow as Snob the cobler But 'tis always your way You don't know how soon Mr Nipikin our landlord  SNOB  Ha ha ha  ALICE  What's the matter with you  SNOB  Ha ha ha I can't help laughing if I was to die for it To think of the old fool going about talking of his consequence and smirking at every girl he sees  ALICE  O as to that if report does not belie her old Madam Nipikin is as fond of smirking after the fellows as he is after the girls But as I was saying you don't know how soon he may take away the little we have  SNOB  You are always dinning that in my ears as if it was through my misconduct that we are in such distress  ALICE  Why will you face me down that it is not through your misconduct Are not all my misfortunes owing to you Did not you come down into the country when I was in my first place and pretended that you were a young gentleman run away for killing your friend in a duelAnd did not I because the butler was my sweetheart contrive to get you into the houseDid not you persuade me to get a key to the pantry And was not I upon your account turn'd awayOh that I had never seen your bewitching face  SNOB  Well well but Alice  ALICE  And afterwards when I liv'd at the 'Squire's at the same time you offered to take your oath that you lov'd nobody but me had not you a child by the blind fidler's daughter and was not I fool enough to give a year's wages to make the matter up  SNOB  Alice I tell you  ALICE  But henceforward sooner will I believe that a room can be clean without being swept that brasses will look bright without being scoured or that butter will come when the witch is in the churn than that truth or constancy can be found in man  AIR  Ah have you forgot then unkind as you are  When housemaid I liv'd at the 'Squire's  All the wine and good things that I cribb'd with such care  Every morn when I lighted the fires  And have you forgot how I lean'd on my broom  And in rapture heard all that you said  'Till scolded I got for not sweeping the room  And beat for not making the bed  II  When you told me you'd have me my brush and my mop  Kept time while with pleasure I'd sing  And soon 'twas the talk at the chandler's shop  You had purchas'd the licence and ring  But when with such joy we return'd from the church  And with truth I could call you my own  You swore that I ne'er should be left in the lurch  And I envied no Queen on her throne  SCENE II  SNOB  The jade has suffered a devilish deal that's the truth on't and one way or other my circumstances are in a blessed way If my Master Nipikin should seize my goods as he swore last night he would 'tis all over with usWell 'tis to be hoped something else will turn upThis is now about my twelfth metamorphosis and faith I should be very sorry to throw it off for I have tasted more satisfaction under the habit of a cobler than I ever did in any of my other characters though a soldier a mountebank an exciseman and an itinerant preacher were among the number  AIR  Like a tennis ball am I  Now sinking low now bounding high  Bandied here and bandied there  To and fro and every where  Now on the topmost round  Of fortune's wheel I fly  Now am I groveling found  Beneath her feet to lie  Still like a tennis ball I fare  Now on the ground now in the air  Bandied here and bandied there  To and fro and every where  Contentment health and competence  Are rarely found in any lot  And therefore will I learn from hence  To keep and prize the one I've got  SCENE III  ALICE  afterwards  FROTH  ALICE  How I am us'd and after behaving to him as I doHe does not deserve such a true and faithful wife for I am sure though I have never mentioned a word of it that Mr Nipikin has been trying a whole twelvemonth to make me bad and I have always given him his own with a witness And as for Dick Froth the tapster if I'd go off with him I am sure he'd love me for ever and every body knows that Dick on account of his townedication is the gayest young fellow in these parts I don't mind being poor a bit if I could but be us'd kindI have it Dick's mistress Madam Nipikin is as fond of him as the old fool his master is of me and sobut here he comesYour servant Mr Richard what have you done with my husband  FROTH  Why he is fairly set in with his guzzling companions and so I thought I could not take a more properer time than while you are left like a turkle here alone to shew you the difference between him who deserts you and him who would wish to deserve youwas not that very prettily said of me  ALICE  Indeed Mr Richard I don't understand being affronted so I told you you know the last time you talked to me in this manner that I'd tell my husband  FROTH  Oh my dear I have been too much among the Bucks de Sprits of the age to mind husbands besides my dear what you drink with your meals need not hinder you from having a cordial privately in your closetPrettily said again  ALICE  I'll be even with you for all this impudenceWell Mr Richard you are so smart and so clever where the duce did you get all these winning ways  FROTH  I dont know my dear they came naturally to me Take pity on me for stamp my vitals as my Lord Huntingdon says in the play if I en't immensely in love with you  ALICE  How can that be when your mistress  FROTH  What you are jealous of herDon't name the old frightful Jezebelwhy I only say a few civil things to her now and then that I may be able to sport this appearance  ALICE  And have you endur'd so much as you say upon my account  FROTH  Endur'd why my dear I have endur'd more than would kill ten horses what with your cruelty and the drudgery of making love to my mistress I have endur'd more than ever Cannibal did when he pass'd over the whatyoucall'ems the frosty mountains to fight Skippio  ALICE  And what would you say if I was to be kinder  FROTH  Saythatthatlord I don't know what I should say  ALICE  Well if you'll promise to do as I would have you I don't know but I may  FROTH  Raptures and Paradise  ALICE  You must favour the old woman and get what money you can from her I'll do the same by your master and then when we have got a pretty good sum together we'll march off and let them find us where they can  FROTH  What a devillish deal of wit you haveWell I'll go about it directlyBless you I can wheedle her out of any thingI say what a charming  scheme 'twill beI'll take care and have it put in all the papers How prettily it will sound  "Last week eloped from her husband Mrs Alicia Snob in company with a genteel young man one Richard Froth a tapster at the Black Ram in the village of Guzzlewell the reason of her committing this rash action is not known"  Adieu I'll soon bring you some of the old woman's cash  SCENE IV  ALICE  With this money and what I can wheedle from the old man will I settle Snob's affairs and who knows when he finds I have done so kindly by him but he'll repent of his follies and behave better to me for the future But suppose he does notI must bear it as well as I canfor though I am not very wise I have sense enough to know that a woman who can consent to be wicked to revenge herself upon her husband only takes a thorn out of her finger to place it in her heart  AIR  Such usage as this is what wife but myself  Wou'd put up with and not sigh and sob  No cross in her pocket or food on her shelf  Or what husband wou'd let her but Snob  And yet let me hope though for every crime  He had more than there's days in a year  That his heart is so good I should still see the time  When a different man he'd appear  II  But if I'm deceiv'd while another guess wife  So treated would scold and revile  Though poor though confin'd in a prison for life  With him I'd endeavour to smile  I love him and every way I'll pursue  In my power his affections to keep  And if then he should slight me I've nothing to do  But to wish he was kinderand weep  SCENE V  NIPIKIN FROTH  NIP  Well now is every thing going as I would have it are the company in the one the two the three and the five satisfied do they say they have no reason to complain  FROTH  Yes yes Sir all satisfied The company up stairs who you know are always pleased if there is any thing to be pleased at are as merry lord they are laughing ready to split their sides those below indeed look a little serious and wise but to say the truth they are generally such a pack of  NIP  Hush you young dog hush you don't consider that every thing must be recommended to them before it will get a good name abroadWhat do they say who come in carriages  FROTH  Oh they are as goodnatur'd as usual You have nothing to do but to set Worcestershire Perry before them and call it Champaigne  NIP  I won't suffer you to say these things before me Mr Richard You don't consider that to the guests who frequent this house I owe all I have in the world and are under the same obligation to them all from the clubroom where they call for twelvepenny worth of punch to the best parlour where they give five shillings for a bottle of ClaretBut I must not stand

reflect a little about my affairsWhat shall I do to extricate myselfSuppose I strike up to old Mother Nipikinthat's the mark Staystay here she comes I'll listen and here what sort of a humour she is in  Mrs  NIP  Well surely nothing can be a more simpler contract than for a woman of my prudence and virtue to place her infections upon a rattlepated boy If we like a man the lightest hint sophisticates whereas a boy proposes upon us  SNOB  Madam your humble servant As to what you was a saying of a woman of your age and prudence fixing your affections upon a boy I agree with you that it is a damn'd foolish thing we are all sophisticated as you call it at one time or another by love For instance now you are as ugly and as old as any gentlewoman need to be yet I don't know how it is I am stark mad in love with you and can think of nothing else  AIR  Whene'er I am mending a shoe  Every thing in my stall that I view  To my doating remembrance brings you  While my heart in my bosom goes throb  The best upper leather's your hair  Your skin is the lining so fair  My awl to your eyes I compare  Which wounded the heart of poor Snob  II  Your teeth which like ivory shew  Are the pegs in a white even row  Which I drive while at every blow  My heart in my bosom goes throb  Each object of you bears a part  Your wit that's so piercing and smart  Is my knife but my lapstone your heart  Which will ne'er let you pity poor Snob  Mrs  NIP  Is the man mad  SNOB  Why don't I tell you I amI am in love with you and do you want a better proof of it  Mrs  NIP  How dare you  SNOB  Why to be

till night and dream of you from night till morning and when I sit in my stall and reflect upon your beauty and my unworthiness I leave off whistling and fall a cryingShe comes to  Mrs  NIP  Why you surprize me Mr Snob  SNOB  Why Lord love you I am surprised myself but it is true you are never out of my mind you have more charms and graces than there are stitches in a shoe and if you don't take compassion on me I'll snatch up one of my own awls and make an end of myself  Mrs  NIP  Oh I would not for the world have you kill yourself upon my account  SNOB  Take me then to your arms  Goes to

alone to flatter  This poor face to shew his wit  So thinking no such treatment right  Lest he some rudeness should commit  I scream'd I own with all my might  SNOB  II  Now let me speakThis accusation  Partly false and partly true  Is meant to blind her inclination  Both from old Nipikin and you  D'ye mind me I say littlemum  I spoke was in a charming cue  And so 'twas well her husband

ALICE  Why I thought it and I told you of it but my comfort is that it is owing to no fault of mine I have taken care enough to discharge the duty of a wife for I am sure there has not been one breakfast dinner or supper for this twelvemonth past that I have not told you of a hundred and fifty faults and all to no purpose  SNOB  Prithee prithee don't upbraid me what's to be done  ALICE  I

give it to my husband  NIP  Oh the devil  he  here  SCENE the last  SNOB NIPIKIN  Mrs  NIPIKIN  and  ALICE  NIP  And  she  here now I'm in a pretty pickle indeed  SNOB  Madam I don't know what your business is with your husband but you are come in excellent time to give him a lecture for making love to my wife  Mrs  NIP  And this is the return for all the intention I have shewn you but I am perfectly manur'd to illtreatment  SNOB  Come hang it we must not let her carry it off soMaster Nipikin ask her what she did with the twenty pounds you gave her to pay the brewer  NIP  How's this  Mrs  NIP  Why what did I do with it  ALICE  You gave it to your lover Mr Richard Froth who gave it to me  NIP  What d'ye mean  ALICE  I'll explain  AIR  'Twas in a village near Castlebury  A Cobler and his Wife did dwell  And for a time no two so merry  Their happiness no tongue can tell  But to this couple the neighbours tell us  Something did happen that caus'd much strife  For going to a neighbouring alehouse  The man got druuk and beat his wife  II  But though he treated her so vilely  What did this wife good creature do  Slept snug and found a method slily  To wring his heart quite through and through  For Dick the tapster and his master  By the report that then was rife  Were both in hopes by this disaster  To gain the Cobler's pretty wife  III  While things went on to rack and ruin  And all their furniture was sold  She seem'd t'approve what each was doing  And got from each a purse of gold  So when the Cobler's cares were over  He swore to lead an alter'd life  To mind his work ne'er be a rover  And love no other but his wife  We have now nothing to do I think my dear but to thank you Sir for releasing us out of all our troubles and you Ma'am for giving us money to set up afresh  NIP  The whole of one accusation to my shame I confess  Mrs  NIP  And I own I cannot deny one particle of the other  SNOB  I need not then advise you to be friends because one is as much to blame as the other As to the money take it Alice do with it what you please Henceforward I'll be guided by you and if my neighbours ask me why I am so happy when they hear me sing as I work in my stall I'll tell them 'tis because I have A WIFE OF TEN THOUSAND  AIR  SNOB  Joy shall henceforth spring around  Pleasure shall await our call  And real happiness be found  Within a lowly Cobler's stall  Tho' sunk by fortune poor and low  Did great ones see our happy life  They'd wish their grandeur to forgo  And imitate the Cobler's wife  Mrs  NIP  II  And what becomes of you and I  Our pride methinks is taken down  We've held I fear our heads too high  To be thus humbled by a clown  If then what's past you will forget  For you're not wrong'd upon my life  I'll mind the pattern she has set  And imitate the Cobler's wife  ALICE  III  'Tis well resolv'd and were the fair  But one and all in the same mind  'Twould save a world of grief and care  Wives would be blest and husbands kind  For to the cottage from the throne  The same desires bring joy and strife  One motive actuates alone  His Lordship's and the Cobler's wife  NIP  IV  Now having caus'd this pretty rout  With fear and trembling overcome  I hardly know what I'm about  What shall I say when I get home  I never felt the like before  Yet there's one thing would give me life  Nor would I fear disquiet more  If you'd applaud the  COBLER'S WIFE  FINIS
