 AN ACCOUNT OF Mr  Whiston  's PROSECUTION at AND BANISHMENT from THE University of  CAMBRIDGE  First Printed at the End of the  Historical Preface  AD MDCCXI And now Reprinted on Occasion of Dr  Bentley  's late Prosecution Suspension and Deprivation from all his Degrees Rights and Titles in the said UNIVERSITY  With an  APPENDIX  Containing Mr  Whiston  's farther Account and particularly his  Petition  to the ViceChancellor and Heads of  Colleges  after they had chosen a New Professor  Never before Printed  Judge not according to the Appearance but judge Righteous Judgment  Joh vii  LONDON  Printed for the AUTHOR And are to be Sold by  J Roberts  near the  OxfordArms  in  WarwickLane  Price  d  An  ACCOUNT  of Mr  Whiston  's Prosecution at and Banishment from the University of  Cambridge  _UPON  Sunday Octob  on which Day a Sermon in Defence of the  Athanasian  Creed was preach'd by Mr  Hughes  of  Jesus  College at St  Mary  's I was summon'd by Mr  Atwood  of  Pembroke  DeputyBeadle to appear before the ViceChancellor the next Day at Three a Clock in the Afternoon Accordingly I was that Day about Four a Clock conducted into an UpperRoom of the ViceChancellor's Lodge and appeared before Dr  Roderick  Provost of  King  'sCollege the ViceChancellor Sir  John Ellis  Knight Master of  Caius  College Dr  James  Master of  Queen  's  Regius  Professor of Divinity Dr  Blithe  Master of  Clare  Hall Dr  Balderston  Master of  Emanuel  Dr  Covel  Master of  Christ  's Dr  Richardson  Master of  PeterHouse  Dr  Ashton  Master of  Jesus  Dr  Fisher  Master of  Sidney  and Dr  Lany  Master of  Pembroke  The UniversityRegister Mr  Grove  of St  John  's being there also Where Note That the Lord Bishop of  Chester  Master of  CatherineHall  tho' newly come to Town never appear'd with the Heads at any of their Meetings about me but  publickly at least  kept himself wholly unconcern'd in the Matter  I came to the ViceChancellor's Lodge with a Friend whose Presence and Assistance I desir'd But he was not permitted to go up Stairs So I was all alone before my Judges I was then immediately shewed a Book by Mr ViceChancellor and ask'd whether I would look upon it and own it to be mine Perceiving that it was the  Sermons and Essays upon several Subjects  I reply'd that I would not answer any such Questions nor would I so much as look upon the Book Affirming that all which I had to say was in a written Paper in my Hands Neither would I make any other Answer tho' then and all along many ensnaring Questions were put to me But when I still persisted in the same Answers the ViceChancellor who with the rest seem'd much surpriz'd at this cautious Conduct of mine was oblig'd to call for other Evidence Accordingly Mr  Crownfield  our Printer who had been terrify'd and threaten'd with being turn'd out of his Place by some of the Heads for barely permitting his Boy to carry the  Proposals  for Printing my  Primitive Christianity Reviv'd  to them was sent for and depos'd so much as amounted to  probable Evidence  That I had sent the small  Essay upon the Epistles of  Ignatius to be dispers'd in  Cambridge  and that I had sent a Letter to the ViceChancellor which is set down  p    c  of my  Historical Preface  and to  plain Proof  That I desir'd his Boy might carry the foremention'd  Proposals  to the several Heads of Colleges the  Tuesday  before but could say nothing to the  Sermons and Essays on several Subjects  The  Regius  Professor particularly wonder'd that I would not clear Mr  Crownfield  by owning the sending the Proposals and intimated That he suppos'd the ViceChancellor would also have  an Order from the Chancery to oblige Mr  Benjamin Tooke  the Bookseller to come from  London  to prove the  Sermons and Essays  upon me and to inform them how they came to  Cambridge  I said that it was not yet Time to say all I intended But that when I made my proper Answer it would be Time enough to think of such Things That I had been accustom'd to Reason Arguments and Testimonies but not to Law So I had taken Advice as to my Answers and observ'd the same Advice all along Which he own'd it was reasonable for me to do as one that he believ'd had never before been us'd to such legal Proceedings He also took notice of an Expression of mine in my Letter to the ViceChancellor beforemention'd as if I were apprehensive of somewhat like  Persecution  that might befal me And he added that he durst say  No Body there had any Intention to persecute me  About this Time it was that the Depositions of Mr  Hughes  and Mr  Townsend  of  Jesus  of Mr  Amyas  and Mr  Macro  of  Caius  and of Mr  Thackham  of  King  's which were in Part if not wholly obtain'd by the ViceChancellor's Procurement not by the voluntary Appearance of the Parties themselves were openly read to me as they here follow  Verbatim  Certificates afterward depos'd upon Oath  I well remember that hearing Mr  Whiston  one  Sunday  in the Afternoon at the ParishChurch of St  Clements  in the Town of  Cambridge  explaining the First Article of the Apostles Creed Having established the Unity of the Godhead by several proper Arguments he asserted There was but One God and that God the Father only was that One God That the Father was in all the Ancient and Primitive Creeds mentioned to be the Only God That the Son was indeed exalted above all Creatures and made a Partaker of many Divine Excellencies and  Perfections and as such He was to be worshipp'd with a Sort or Degree of Divine Worship This is the Substance of what I heard the said Mr  Whiston  deliver in that Lecture There were several other very black and aggravating Expressions which in so long a Space of Time have slipp'd my Memory But as to the Truth of this I am ready and willing to give my Oath  JOHN HUGHES  In the Year in the Parish Church of St  Clement  's in  Cambridge  I heard Mr  Whiston  in one of his Carechetical Lectures upon the Apostles Creed deliver these Words or Words to this Effect  viz  As to the Dignity of our Saviour's Person's though he be a Being of vastly great and immense Perfections yet I cannot say as some do that he is equal to God the Father Because I should contradict my Blessed Saviour himself who says expresly  My Father is greater than I  Neither can I assert that he is Omniscient for if I should I should contradict my Blessed Saviour himself who says He knew not of the Day of Judgment  Of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man no not the Angels which are in Heaven neither the Son but the Father  Neither can I assert that he is Essentially Good For then also I should contradict my Blessed Lord and Saviour himself who to a certain Ruler that called him  Good Master  said  Why callest thou me Good None is Good save One that is God  Witness my Hand  SA TOWNSEND  Octob  The Two First Articles mentioned by Mr  Townsend  I do likewise attest To which Mr  Whiston  at the same Time added That all the Old Books of our Religion witnessed the same or Words to that Effect  J AMYAS  I do Declare that at the same Place and Time I heard Mr  Whiston  speak those Words all abovemention'd by Mr  Townsend  or Words to that Effect  Witness my Hand  THO MACRO  Octob    Memorand  That at a Meeting of the Ministers concerning the CharitySchools at the Old CoffeeHouse in  Cambridge  about  Michaelmas  last was Twelvemonth Mr  Townsend  making a Motion for the Removal of Mr  Whiston  from the Stewardship by reason of Heretical Tenets interspers'd in his Catechetical Lectures Mr  Whiston  Enquir'd What Tenets they might be I reply'd The Denial of the Divinity of the Son He said He own'd him as God I ask'd Whether as God  ab aeterno  He answered No Nor had any of the Fathers for the first Three Centuries  At another Meeting about a Quarter of a Year since on the Occasion and at the Place abovementioned Mr  Whiston  offered a Paper hereunto annexed in Vindication of his Alteration of the Doxologies subjoined to Dr  Brady  's Translation of the  Psalms  a Part whereof he was authoriz'd to Print for the Use of the CharitySchools He having asserted his Alteration to be such as we might all join in as in the Paper is specified I ask'd him whether he could not join with us in this  To Father Son and Holy Ghost One God whom we Adore  He reply'd He would be a  Turk  as soon  These several Depositions I am ready to confirm by Oath  W THACKHAM  NB  The Paper referr'd to in this last Deposition is that inserted toward the End of my Historical  Preface And observe that the last vehement Expression of mine  That I would be a  Turk  assoon  was to the best of my Remembrance followed by these Words or others to the same Effect which are omitted by Mr  Thackham viz  That is a rash Expression But I mean that this Language is so entirely contrary to the Nature of the Christian Religion that I cannot go into it for any Consideration whatsoever  Some Time after these Depositions were read I desired to know when it was a proper Time to give in my Answer Which when it was intimated I publickly read this Paper and delivered it in as follows  Verbatim  Mr ViceChancellor  Saving to my self all future Legal Advantages either as to the Jurisdiction of this Consistory to the Form of Proceedings therein or to any other Matters whatsoever I do now desire that I may have a true Copy of the Statute upon which I am charg'd and of the Articles and Depositions given me I do also desire a competent Time may be allow'd me for making my Defence which is never deny'd in Cases of this Nature And that I may have Leave though it be  TermTime  to go to  London  for some Weeks where those my Papers are out of which my Defence is in good Part to be made Especially since I intend that that Defence shall be very full and particular and drawn up by the best Advice And I cannot but beg and hope that you will all hear and consider what I shall have hereafter to offer in my Answer with that Justice Equity and Candor which the Laws of Nature of the Gospel and of the Land require and particularly in so important a Cause concerning the True Christian Faith and Practice which your selves would expect to be heard with in the like Case and which the Certainty of all our Appearing before  Christ's own Tribunal at the Great Day does demand from you  WILL WHISTON  Camb  Octob    Here follows also a true Copy of the th Statute of the University upon which all these Proceedings were grounded  CAP XLV De Concionibus  Nullus Concionator sit vel aliquam concionem pro gradu suo habeat nisi ad minimum Diaconus

Universitate exulabit  But to go on with my Narrative  After I had deliver'd my Paper desiring Copies of the Statute and of the Depositions and competent Time for my Answer the former Parts were readily granted me but the Third much debated I desired six Weeks Time as not too long in a Matter of such great Importance and gave particular Reasons for it I also assured them that the main of that Answer would not be what they so much and often and earnestly fear'd and caution'd against the producing my Original Testimonies in way of Justification of my Opinions but would principally turn on those very Two Heads Mr ViceChancellor propos'd as proper for it  viz  The shewing that my Doctrines were either not truly and compleatly represented or were not so contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of  England  as the ViceChancellor and some others imagin'd I was answer'd That this ConsistoryCourt used not to allow so long Time as those at  Westminster  and thev were by no means willing to allow any considerable Time However the Master of  Jesus  was for a competent Time that I might send for my Papers from  London  And somebody hinted as if a Week was more usually the Time afforded in this Consistory The Master of  Peterhouse  tho' he did not own the Necessity of a very long Time yet confess'd that I must have Time allow'd me for my Answer Accordingly I fully expected such Allowance And when the Master of  Peterhouse  left them it seems a Week's Time was intended for that Answer But all this notwithstanding when I was finally call'd in that Master being gone  I heard not a Syllable more about it but was immediately order'd to appear again on  Wednesday  to receive the main Charge of which presently and for other farther Proceedings And when I once spake of going to  London  for Advice or Assistance the Master of  Emanuel  said It was fit I should go live elsewhere and remove from  Cambridge  since I had there perverted some already The Masters of  Sidney  and  Pembroke  not only seem'd to grudge the least Delay for my Answer but would needs tell me what an Answer I was to make I reply'd that I should not ask their Advice for the making that Answer but use my own Judgment Nay when the Master of  Jesus  plainly own'd the Reasonableness of some considerable Time for my Answer the Master of  Pembroke  seem'd very angry at him for it Yet when I once with some Vehemence said  "There has somewhat been alledg'd here which I am surpriz'd to find so many Clergymen to say"  m  aning their Assertion That the  Three Persons  collectively taken were the  One God of the Christian Religion  and not  God the Father  contrary to all manner of Sacred and Primitive Doctrine and Language no Notice was taken of it at all But to go on with the main Narrative Upon a Second Summons I appear'd again on  Wednesday Octob  th But now in a lower Parlour of the same Lodge none being present but my Judges as before Dr  Covel  and Dr  Richardson  being now absent and Dr  Gower  Master of St  John  's the Lady  Margarets  's Professor present in their Room When I appear d expecting the allowance of Time not only for my main Answer but for the clearing the Exceptions I had to make to their Evidence and Proceedings instead thereof I had only the sorementioned Paper of the main Charge given me and a solemn Admonition therewith to leave my Errors and return to the Doctrine of the Church of  England  or else on  Monday  they would  proceed to execute the Statute upon me Only I was allowed to read and deliver in what I had prepared as an Answer so far or as my Complaints of and Exceptions against their Proceedings These Two Papers the first deliver'd to me and the second by me here follow  verbatim  Positions published and spread about in the University of  Cambridge  by Mr  Will Whiston contra Religionem c Stat Acad  Vid  Postscript thro' out  Vid  Sermons and Essays  c p    l  to  p    l    l  to Mr  Thackham  's Depos Mr  Hughes  Depos Mr  Townsend

Son and Holy Ghost being the One God of the Christian Religion  This Position is contrary to the and th of the Articles and to the  Nicene  and  Athanasian  Creeds  That the Creed commonly call'd the Creed of St  Athanasius  is a gross and Antichristian Innovation and Corruption of the Primitive Purity and Simplicity of the Christian Faith among us  This Position is contrary to the Rubrick before the said Creed and the th Article  Vid  Serm and Essays  c  Note  p    That the Canon of the Scripture the Rule and Guide of a Christian's Faith and Practice is that contain'd in the last of the Ecclesiastical Canons ordinarily stil'd Apostolical Which all along appears to have been the Standard of the Primitive Church in this matter I mean as including all the Books we now own for Canonical and also the Two Epistles of St  Clement  and the Constitutions of  the Apostles by St  Clement  To which the Pastor of  Hermas  is to be added as well as we have already added the Apocalypse of St  John  Proposals  c  Side Vol III  l    That the  Doctrine of the Apostles  appears to be a Sacred Book of the New Testament long lost to the Christian Church  These Two Positions are contrary to the Sixth of the Articles  Proposals first Side Vol II  Mr  Whiston  undertakes to prove clearly that the Apostolical Constitutions are the most Sacred Part of the Canonical Scriptures of the New Testament  Vid  Postscript  p    l ult  Mr  Whiston  asserts that the Doxology current in all these latter Ages  Vid  Thackham  his Deposition  Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost  was not the true Christian Doxology  This Position is against the Doxology receiv'd and establish'd in the publick Liturgy  Dated  Octob    This Paper was deliver'd to Mr  Whiston  the Day and Year abovewritten by Mr ViceChancellor's Order  Witness my Hand  Robert Grove  My Answer Or Complaints of and Exceptions to these Proceedings deliver'd in the same Day  Mr ViceChancellor  The Accusation which now lies against me in this Place gives me but too much Occasion both for  Surprize  and  Complaint  For truly I cannot but be  surpriz'd  that after all my Care and Concern to demean  my self honestly and inoffensively both before God and Men and to discharge my several Duties as a Man a Christian a Clergyman and a Professor of the Mathematicks in this University after an uncommon Search after and Zeal for the pure original uncorrupt Doctrines and Duties of Christianity as they appear in the Sacred Books of the Old and New Testament and in all the most Ancient and Primitive Fathers and yet as far as possible with a constant and regular Compliance with the Rules and Orders of the Church of  England  after my earnest Endeavours to recover and retrieve several of the Original Sacred Books of our Religion long lost or despis'd or neglected in these latter Ages at least in these Western Parts of  Christendom  and after such great Success in those and my other Enquiries that of all the many Learned Persons who have perus'd my Papers not any of them has undertaken to write an Answer to them After all this I say I cannot but be  surpriz'd  that without sending for any of those Papers or at all examining them and without allowing me any publick Conference and Disputation about the Notions contained in them while every one else is permitted if not encouraged to preach and dispute against me upon all Occasions I am forced to stand here as an Offender and a Criminal on Account of them  Nicodemus  tho' so timerous as to come to Jesus by Night only yet ventured to say in the midst of the Rulers of the  Jews  John VII  Doth our Law judge any Man before it hear him and know what he doth  And certainly 'tis not consistent with common Justice with the Nature of the Christian Doctrine nor with the Honour of this Learned Body to censure or condemn either me or my Opinions till upon a mature and solemn Examination it plainly appears that those Opinions are not only false but groundless and by Consequence that I am  grosly mistaken in them and ought to retract them And give me leave to say that this Method of Conference and Examination is that which ought always to be and has ordinarily been used in such Cases Nor has it I suppose been any where denied among those that call themselves Christians but in the Popish Inquision it self And this is certainly the only way to influence reasonable Men in such Matters And as to my self I promise that it shall influence me even to perpetual Silence and the burning my own Papers if the contrary Doctrines can produce but one Tenth Part of that Evidence that Original Evidence which I shall then allege for what I shall there defend Nor will any other Method at all weigh with me as to my Faith or Practice For I dare say you are all persuaded that I am not so insincere or fearful as to retract or renounce any thing which upon full Examination I am really persuaded to be either a Truth or a Duty of the Christian Religion out of the Apprehension of what any such Tribunal as this can inflict upon me Permit me Mr ViceChancellor to say farther that this Way of Conference and Examination is that very Method which is mark'd out by an Ancient and Famous Precedent when this very Statute now before you was first us'd I mean the Case of Professor  Cartwright  in the Days of Queen  Elizabeth  whom Archbishop  Whitgift  the then ViceChancellor and the University would not proceed against till they had invited him to a Conference and that in Writing in order to his Conviction But which he refused and was thereupon censur'd and expell'd As the Authentick Record a Copy of which is hereunto annex'd will testify The Case is here quite otherwise I am not only willing to accept of any such Invitation but do here solemnly Invite the University to this Conference and Examination Nay I Demand it as the Right of the  Sacred Truths of Christianity and what this Learned Body cannot either in Equity or Honour deny that I be thus heard and my Papers fairly and fully examin'd before any farther Proceedings be had in this Matter And to encourage your Acceptance of this Proposal I do sincerely declare that I will have no regard therein to Victory or Triumph but will alone seek for Truth and genuine Christianity For God is my Witness that I am very unwilling to be in the least deceiv'd my self or to deceive the Church of Christ And that I am always very desirous of the Opportunity of improving and correcting my Notions and Papers that so the least Syllable of the Truths of Christ Jesus may not receive any Diminution or Misrepresentation by me when my Papers come to be published  But then Mr ViceChancellor besides my  Surprize  at the several Things abovementioned with Relation to this Procedure I think I have great Reason for  Complaint  on many Accounts also Accordingly I must here take the Liberty to  complain  That Matters have a long while been very unfairly and clancularly manag'd against me That during the last Two Years and above half wherein it has been known that I have been upon those Enquires whence the present Accusation is taken No ViceChancellor no publick Professor not any one of those in Authority here which are known to be the most disatisfy'd have ever sent for me and my Papers and discoursed me freely or given me a friendly Caution about them I think I have also Reason to complain that so many and such improper Ways have been try'd to procure some Censure upon me as if I were such a publick Enemy that all the Methods that could be thought of were to be used for my Destruction Once a  Grace  of the Senate House was to be procur'd for my Expulsion without my being heard at all When  that did not do I have as I hear been threaten'd with the Ecclesiastical Court and with the Assizes Then Advice was taken whether I could not with safety be legally convicted of Heresy and so be expell'd by Mr  Lucas  's Statutes And now a remote University Statute not at all in its main and Original Design as I conceive reaching my Case and such an one as if strain'd to the same Rigor as to others might expel I believe much the greatest part of the University is at last produc'd against me This Statute is  De Concionibus  concerning publick Sermons and such like Publick Acts and Lectures before the University How can this Statute possibly reach me since I never had the Honour to preach before the University in my Life I never kept any Divinity Act or oppos'd in the Divinity Schools since I was admitted My Publick Lectures have been all Mathematical and being most of them printed will shew how remote they have been from any things of this Nature This Statute must therefore be strained beyond all reasonable Construction e're it can affect me I have indeed formerly had an Afternoon Lecture in the Town of  Cambridge  by the Bishop's sole Permission and upon his sole Salary But 'tis the Opinion of the best Judges that whatever I said there can no way be us'd to my Prejudice in this Place The Parish Churches at least ordinarily when none but the Inhabitants are suppos'd to be present being certainly under no other Cognizance than of the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of the Diocese And accordingly One Person of this University about a Year and a half ago did once make some Complaint to our Diocesan for what happen'd in one of those Churches who thereupon appointed us to appear before him at a certain Hour the next day I came at the Hour appointed and stay'd about an Hour expecting my Accuser but he did not come till the Bishop and my self were both gone Which hindred  any farther Proceedings And sure I cannot be accus'd both before the Bishop and before this Consistory for the same pretended Offences in the same Parish Church I do therefore insist upon it that the true Extent of this Statute may be fully consider'd before any thing be done against me by virtue of it As also I desire it may be consider'd whether Words pretended to be spoken so long ago especially where the Time is either not specify'd at all or not nearer than that of a whole Year's space can be admitted against me And whether Books published at  London  and private Discourses elsewhere can come within the reach of this Statute where the Offences punishable by it must be committed not only  infra Universitatem nostram  in a Place belonging to the University but must be done  publicè docendo tractando vel defendendo  in publick and solemn Sermons Lectures or Disputations before the same University I do also complain that the Chancellor of the University has not as I believe been acquainted with this Matter when the Statute says all the Proceedings upon it are to be  Cancellarii jussa  And tho' in ordinary Affairs the ViceChancellor may have Authority enough to act for the Chancellor and may well enough exercise that Authority yet certainly in a Case of so uncommon a Nature and of such mighty Consequence the like whereto I will be bold to say never before came into this Consistory it was but reasonable that the Chancellor himself should be acquainted and his Directions receiv'd before any Proceedings should have been begun by the University I do also complain that the Accusations or Depositions against me relate generally to Things long since past and gone without the pretence of any new Offences unless the Civility of sending some inoffensive Proposals to any of you can be esteem'd of that Nature I hope I may well call them  inoffensive  since they plainly are such and will appear  such to every Christian Reader that peruses them I have also I think great Reason to complain that I am as it were by this Procedure prevented in my honest Design recommended to me by a very learned and pious Prelate of our own Church and readily agreed to by me of laying all my Papers before the Convocation which is almost now ready to fit for their Consideration and Correction Sure the University will never suppose or believe that the Convocation will censure without Examination nor is the University to prejudge a Cause which most properly belongs to the Cognizance and Judgment of the Convocation I do also complain that I have been so exceeding privately conven'd and particularly interrogated and not in the Consistory before the University where all that desir'd might have been present and I might have had such Assistance as Law and Equity do allow As if some Men's Hopes of oppressing me arose rather from the Prospect of the Terror I should be under in such Circumstances and the unwary Answers I should thereupon make than from the Strength of the Evidence and the Notoriety of the Offences I could be prov'd to be guilty of I do lastly complain that as I am inform'd such a sort of Determination has been lately made about the Sense of that Statute whereby I am charg d as might best reach my Case before I have been any way heard or any legal Advice has been taken concerning the true Extent and Meaning of it contrary I think to the plain Rules of Justice and Equity in such a Case  These Mr Vice Chancellor are the principal Occasions of that  Surprize  and  Complaint  which I at first mention'd Not that they all directly affect your selves from whom I am willing to hope for nothing but Fairness Justice and Equity but because they all belong to some Members of this University And for a Conclusion give me leave to say that  these Matters are of such mighty Consequence they are become so very publick and the Fairness and Necessity of a solemn Examination are so generally own'd by the Archbishops and Bishops and the rest of those learned Men of all Parties who have perused my Papers that if the Proceeding in this Matter here be with Haste Precipitation and Severity those that act in it will not only wound their own Consciences commit an heinous Offence against God and thereby expose themselves to severe Punishment from his Hand but there will hereby be laid a lasting an indelible Blot and Reproach upon the University as undertaking rashly and violently to punish me before it appears that I am at all guilty of any Offence to deserve that Punishment While at the same time I shall not only have the Comfort of an innocent Conscience for my Support but shall also have the Expectation of speedy Relief and Redress from the known Justice and Equity of those who represent Her Sacred Majesty in Her Courts of Judicature to which in that Case I shall be obliged immediately to appeal  Saving therefore to my self the Liberty of making any other future Exceptions to these Proceedings against me The principal ones that I make at present are these I say  That I am charged with breaking that th Statute which I have been uncapable of breaking because it only concerns such Publick UniversityExercises as I have never perform'd  That the Place where most of the Words are pretended to have been spoken St  Clement  's Church is utterly out of the Jurisdiction of the University and so no ways within this Statute  That the want of the Specification of the Time or the too loose Specification of it renders most of the Depositions of no Value  That Words charged at so great a Distance of Time cannot be sworn to so particularly as is necessary to affect me  That Words spoken in private Conversation or at a CoffeeHouse or written in a private Letter can no way be within this Statute  That no Books printed and published at  London  can be within this Statute  That I ought to have been conven'd publickly in the Consistory and Evidence fairly there produced against me in an open Court and not privately in a Chamber been ask'd many ensnaring Questions with the Exclusion of even a single Friend who was willing to have been there to assist and direct me  That any prior Determination of the Sense of this Statute before I have had Council allowed me or legal Advice taken about its true Extent and Meaning is of no Force at all against me  And I desire and demand that I may have Time given me and Council allow'd me to argue the Validity of these Exceptions  WILL WHISTON  Octob    NB  The Record herein referred to about Professor  Cartwright  is taken out of Dr  Fuller  's History of the University of  Cambridge  Page and runs thus  Ann Reg Eliz      Ann Dom      March    Whereas it is reported that Master  Cartwright  offering Disputations and Conference touching the Assertions uttered by him and subscribed with his Hand and that he could not obtain his Request therein this is to Testify that in the Presence of us whose Names are here underwritten and in our hearing the said Mr  Cartwright  was offered Conference of divers and namely of  Mr Doctor  Whitgift  who offered That if the said Mr  Cartwright  would set down his Assertions in Writing and his Reasons unto them he would answer the same in Writing also the which Master  Cartwright  refus'd to do Further the said Dr  Whitgift  at such Time as Mr  Cartwright  was deprived of his Lecture did in our Presence ask the said Mr  Cartwright  whether he had both publickly and privately divers Times offer'd the same Conference unto him by writing or not To which Mr  Cartwright  answered That he had been so offered and that he refused the same Moreover the said Mr  Cartwright  did never offer any Disputation but upon these Conditions  viz  That he might know who should be his Adversaries and who should be his Judges meaning such Judges as he himself could best like of Neither was this Kind of Disputation deny'd unto him but only he was required to obtain License of the Queen's Majesty or the Council because his Assertions be repugnant to the State of the Commonwealth which may not be called into Question by publick Disputation without License of the Prince or his Highness's Council  John Whitgift  ViceChancellor  John Mey  Henry Harvey  Thomas B  Andrew Pearne  William Chadderton  Edward Hawford  Thomas  F    Note  Dr  Fuller  says that this  Instrument  is Registred in  Cambridge    When I had read and delivered in this Second Paper I expected some Answer thereto and some legal Notice to have been taken of it But all to no Purpose The Torrent was too strong to be stopp'd by any such Methods The ViceChancellor pretended  without the least Regard to what I had said that they were agreed that the Positions charged upon me were both plainly contrary to the Churches Doctrine and were sufficiently prov'd against me and so they would proceed I thereupon boldly desired to know whether every one there present for they were then the least Number possible that could act in such a Case had entirely agreed to both these Propositions And particularly ask'd Sir  John Ellis  's Opinion He answer'd that he agreed that the Paper deliver'd to me contain'd Doctrines contrary to those of the Church of  England  But whether they had sufficiently prov'd that those Doctrines were chargeable upon me he did not determine but left that to others Yet did they proceed as if Sir  John  had equally agreed to both those Particulars which 'tis certain he did not and that he declared he did not tho' he had hardly leave given him to finish that his Declaration I was then very gravely and solemnly admonished again by the ViceChancellor to leave my Errors and return to the Church of  England  or else he let me know that on  Monday  at Three a Clock they would proceed to execute the Statute against me without the least Intimation of allowing me so much as one Hours Time to answer the Charge which not till now was properly delivered to me As to my Desire of Conference and fair Examination the ViceChancellor said that the  Regius  Professor might take me to his Lodgings and discourse with me if he pleased to which no Answer was returned by any Body The Lady  Margaret  's Professor also once upbraided me as if I deny'd Things there which elsewhere I asserted which he look'd on as no Argument of that Sincerity I pretended to Upon this I openly desir'd not to be misunderstood but that I only requir'd Legal Proof for what was alledged against me without being ensnared by their Questions and without affirming or denying any Thing  my self about them Whereupon he said no more of that Matter And the  Regius  Professor who understood me so all along did me the Justice to put that Matter right and to explain in what Sense he suppos'd I did not now own or assert any of the Things charged upon me To which I fully assented and so that Imputation came to nothing The  Margaret  Professor farther told me when I insisted on  Examination  before  Censure  that I knew well enough that when Hereticks arose it was not usual to argue with them but to quote some Canon of a Council which condemned them and so to anathematize them immediately I said to him But suppose that what I said about the Apostolical Constitutions  c  should at last prove to be true He replied If so he would come and heartily beg my Pardon The Master of  Jesus  thought Time might be allowed me for my Answer But so earnest and vehement was the ViceChancellor in his Proceedings that all such Motions came to nothing The same Master of  Jesus  also ask'd me why I called the Constitutions  The Most Sacred Book  of the New Testament I answered because they really were so and were so esteemed in the first Ages I also said to him that they would repent their Severity to me And that if he had been by when Dr  Smalridge  who had read my Papers and of whom I believed he had a very good Opinion and my self lately discoursed upon these Matters he would scarce have been against their Examination before they censured me on Account of them Upon which he owned that he had himself also seen some of my Papers Which I suppose was some Time ago when Mr  Hughes  and Mr  Townsend  of the same College had the Perusal of them I mean those which concern the Trinity and Incarnation only But finding the Master of  Sidney  exceeding hot against me  I said to him that I believed he had not studied these Matters He grew passionate and said  That was my Impudence  I said I meant particularly as to the Constitutions He reply'd that he had read them but however that he knew my Assertions were contrary to those of the Church of  England  Which indeed he all along confin'd himself to insomuch that when on  Monday  the Vicechancellor had said with some Moderation that my Tenets were  Erroneous  and  contrary to the Churches Doctrine  and that the  fore I ought to retract them and I had reply'd Let them be but once proved to be  Erroneous  and I was most ready to retract them the Master of  Sidney  at whose Elbow I stood told me they did not mean  Ecroneous  but  contrary to the Doctrine of the Church  Nay when I said to them Will you condemn or censure while none either  will  or  dare  answer me Somebody that was offended at that last Word reply'd  dare  But without any farther Addition And indeed great Care was all along taken that the Truth or Falshood of my Doctrines should be wholly wav'd and all set upon their Contrariety to those of the Church of  England  without so much as a Pretence that any body would answer the Arguments and Testimonies which I had to produce for them It was once urged that my affirming the  Constitutions  and  Doctrine of the Apostles  to be Sacred Books of the New Testament was contrary to the Sixth Article of our Church I desir'd that Article might be read which was done by the Master of  Pembroke  I said thereupon 'Tis plain that this Article owns the present Sacred Books being all the Church then knew and that had they known of more they would have set them down also but that 'tis not affirmed in that Article that there are no other than those and so my Assertion is not contrary thereto Yet did this pass as a clear Contradiction to it And no wonder when in the Paper given me from the Vicechancellor the  very  Nicene  Creed is it self quoted as condemning my calling God the Farher the  One God of the Christian Religion  while yet that Creed begins with a direct and solemn Affirmation of it  I believe in One God the Father Almighty  After all when the Vicechancellor perceived that I began to draw some of the Heads into Arguing and Reasoning about these Matters he took one of the Candles himself and saying a few things to me about a Recantation which I declar'd I could not make with a safe Conscience he said He pitied me and then he fairly conducted me out of the Lodge And so I took my leave having before hinted to them that I did not design to wait on them any more about these Matters but to leave them to do as they pleased therein Which Resolution I kept till  Monday  accordingly For when on  Sunday  I was again summon'd by Mr  Atwood  to appear the next Day at three a Clock I made this Answer That I saw no occasion for appearing any more However for some Reasons I afterward alter'd my Mind and came and appeared again on  Monday  in a lower Room of the same Lodge before the Heads who were now Twelve in Number whose Names will be set down presently And upon Mr Vicechancellor's enquiring of me Whether I came disposed to make a Retractation of those my Errors concerning which he had before Admonish'd me Upon Leave given I read the following Paper as my Answer and deliver'd it in as follows  verbatim  Mr Vicechancellor  I did not think to have appeared to Day at all because I understood that this Meeting was appointed only for my Retractation for which I have neither had any considerable Time nor any proper Motives for Conviction afforded me and so to be sure I cannot be disposed for any such thing Nay indeed  I cannot allow that any Doctrines contrary to those of the Church of  England  and within your Cognizance by the th Statute have been Legally proved upon me However I have thought fit to appear according to the Summons giuen me Yesterday What I have at present to alledge against these Proceedings besides my former Exceptions is That the  Advice for the Study of Divinity  quoted against me was written about  February  and that the Depositions as to what I said in St  Clement  's Church belong to the Year and that if I committed any Offences in either Case they are fully and compleatly forgiven by the last Act of Her Majesty's most Gracious General and Free Pardon Which therefore I do here Plead in Bar to all farther Proceedings And I do think the Molestation already given me is Penal by that Act As to Part of Mr  Thackham  's Deposition which may seem to be a little later than that Act it is not at all charged upon me in the Paper deliver'd to me as the whole Charge against me and so is of no force at all And as to the remaining Charges that from the other Part of Mr  Thackham  's Deposition is only that I would not use a Doxology which our Church I think never uses nor enjoins and which stands on the alone Footing of Dr  Brady  and Mr  Tate  or suchlike private Persons And the other concerning the stiling God the Father the  One and Only God  'tis so expresly the Language of our Church in the  Nicene  Creed and in the Collect for the th  Sunday  after  Trinity  that I am surprized at its being in this manner alledged against me But since you have given no time for the Examination of my Legal Exceptions nor for my own Answer I publickly Protest against your Proceedings and desire that my Protestation may be entred into the Records of the University  WILL WHISTON  Octob    Assoon as I had delivered this Paper and had owned to the Vicechancellor that it contained all that I had to say at present I took my Leave Whereupon the Vicechancellor and the Heads soon came to a Resolution to Banish or Expel me as the following Publick Act will inform the Reader A true Copy of which shall be here set down  October  th  At a Meeting of Mr Vicechancellor and the Heads of Colleges in the University of  Cambridge  in the Vicechancellor's Chamber in  King  's College in the said University  Whereas it hath been proved before us That  William Whiston  Master of Arts Mathematick Professor of this University hath asserted and spread about in  Cambridge  since the th Day of  April  divers Tenets against Religion receiv'd and establish'd by Publick Authority in this Realm contrary to the Forty Fifth Statute of this University And whereas the said  William Whiston  being required and exhorted by Mr Vicechancellor to confess and retract his Error and Temerity in fo doing did refuse to make any such Confession and Retractation It is therefore agreed and resolved by Us the Vicechancellor and Heads of Colleges whose Names are here underwritten that the said  William Whiston  hath incurred the Penalty of the foresaid Statute and that he be Banished from this University according to the Tenour of the same  C Roderick  Vicechancellor  Jo Ellys Humf Gower Hen James  S  Blithe Joh

declaravit pronunciavit prout sequitur  In the Name of God  Amen  I  Charles Roderick  Vicechancellor of this University do decree declare and pronounce that Mr  William Whiston  Mathematick Professor of this University having asserted and spread abroad divers Tenets contrary to Religion receiv'd and establish'd by Publick Authority in this Realm hath incurred the Penalty of the Statute and that he is Banished from this University  Lata fuit hujusmodi sententia per dictum Dominum Procancellarium praesente me Roberto Grove Not Pub Almae Universitatis praedictae Registrario  Now the Reader is here to Observe that since all the Depositions concerning St  Clement  's Church are here given up as being long before the  th  of  April  the Date for the Act of Pardon Since the Passages quoted out of the  Advice for the Study of Divinity  were written still earlier and there is no Pretence of the least Evidence that I any way publish'd it in  Cambridge  and since one Part of Mr  Thackham  's Evidence is made no use of at all in this Matter 'Tis plain that this Banishment or Expulsion is solely grounded on these Three Things My affirming with our Saviour St  Paul  the  Nicene  and all the Original Creeds and most ancient Fathers that the  One and Only God of the Christians is God the Father  John XVII Cor VIII  My Asserting an undoubted Matter of Fact that the Original Christian Doxology was not the Common One but  Glory be to the Father through the Son  or  and the Son in the Holy Ghost  My  Proposing  to prove that the  Constitutions  and  Doctrine of the Apostles  are Sacred Books of the New Testament and the former of them the  most Sacred of the Canonical Books  Which in  time will appear to be undoubtedly true also And all this is done without the least Offer at any Examination into the Truth or Falshood of the same Assertions and so without knowing whether the whole Proceeding be not directly  Fighting against God  and  Opposing and Persecuting the Gospel and Religion of Christ Jesus  And if it prove so at last the Authors had need to think of that timely Repentance and Retraction which they requir'd at my Hands Lest their present Authority and Pretence of an University Statute should be too little to excuse them at the Day of Judgment  But who should be the secret Movers or what should be the secret Reasons why after so long a Forbearance the Vicechancellor and the Heads should all on a sudden in this violent manner resolve to Censure and Expel me is too deep a Mystery for me authentickly to dive into and so I must leave it to another Tribunal For certainly it could not be the Vicechancellor's own Motion originally since he had forborn me all along and was now in a manner out of his Office and was ever remarkable for Caution and Deliberation in all his Proceedings Especially when I suppose that neither himself nor indeed the Major Part of his Assessors do at all pretend to have particularly Examin'd the Matters themselves concerning which they took upon them to be Judges but went plainly at Random by their own Interpretation of an Old Statute to Persecute an Innocent Person for the sake of what they rashly call  Orthodoxy  I venture to stile my self an  Innocent  Person notwithstanding this their Sentence against me because I believe that every one of my Judges acquits me in his own Conscience from any base or sinister Design and is satisfy'd that I did no other than what is certainly every Christian's Duty  viz  The Declaring plainly what upon the most compleat Examination I was satisfy'd were the certain  Truths and Duties of Christianity For which yet without such Examination they have now ventur'd to Censure and Expel me Which things I own I durst not have had a Hand in in any like Case for any Consideration whatsoever But tho' they were my Judges I am not theirs  To their own Master they must stand or fall  Rom XIV  And therefore I can only commit my Cause to God the just Judge of all the World and leave it in his righteous Hands to determine between us However I do heartily wish and hope that as soon as my Papers are publish'd they will still seriously consider them and soberly reconsider this whole Matter and that their sineere Repentance and Retractation will prevent the Danger of any future Punishment from God upon them from that God  who desireth not the Death of a Sinner but his Repentance  Thus ended this University Prosecution and Banishment of me at least this is all that has been done till the Date of these Papers without the least regard to Mr  Lucas  's Statutes or to my Mathematick Professorship depending thereon And so without the direct affecting me as Mr  Lucas  's Professor How plainly soever they have depriv'd me of that Membership of the University which till now either by Right or by Courtesy I was entitled to So I shall go on no farther with this Narration I say in the main affecting me as Mr  Lucas  's Professor only meaning thereby that I claim still notwithstanding this Expulsion or Banishment to be Professor of the Mathematicks of Mr  Lucas  's Foundation and have accordingly a just Right to the Profits thereof upon my doing that Duty by a Deputy as my Statutes direct on a long Absence which I cannot so well do in Person Otherwise this Expulsion must  affect me  sensibly enough in respect of my Maintenance Since the Allowance to a Deputy and the Loss of  the Advantages formerly arising from the Courses of Experiments to say nothing of those from Teaching privately in  Cambridge  and the Charges and Losses of a Removal cannot well be estimated under  l  a Year which is a great Deduction out of a small Subsistence Nay there want not those who would strain this Expulsion from the University to a Deprivation as to my Professorship and so would deprive me of almost all but what the Charity and Kindness of Friends might afford me Which last Method of Support is also by some envied and complained of beforehand As if there were no way to satisfy their Zeal against me but my seeing me and my Family reduc'd to the utmost Poverty and Distress without a Friend to support and relieve me But before I conclude I can hardly avoid saying here that I take the true Original Cause of this Severity to be plainly this That I have written several  Unanswerable Books  which are therefore a terrible Eyesore to those who are more concern'd for Modern Orthodoxy and the pretended Power of the Church in Controversies of Faith than for the pure and undefil'd Religion of Christ Jesus So that when it appear'd as it has done for a considerable time that none of the Learned could or durst undertake the Answering me in the way of Reason Argument and Testimony This Method of Ensnaring me by an Old Statute was thought of And I venture to say this the rather because that  Open  that  Unanswerable  Challenge I made in the  Postscript  of  Ignatius  to the Orthodox to shew but one single Catholick Testimony before the Days of  Athanasius  which affirm'd the Father Son and Holy Ghost to be  One God  or  the One God  of the Christian Religion while I promis'd above an hundred Testimonies in the same time that God the Father was that  One God  appears to have been the principal Evidence against me and that which was most publickly and solemnly read to me by the Master of  Pembroke  as  the main Article of my Charge and for which chiefly I am Censur'd and Expell'd I call it an  Open  and an  Unanswerable  Challenge And I here again make it to the whole Body of the  Christian  World and do venture in the most solemn manner to Appeal to the Consciences of all the truly Learned whether what I have affirm'd on this Head be not undoubtedly and indisputably true and so whether I am not Censur'd and Expell'd for owning my self a Christian nay I may add for asserting the first and most Fundamental Doctrine of the whole Christian Religion I know this repeated Challenge may be most easily Answer'd in the same way that the former was by a repeated Censure For in any other way I am sure it cannot And if that be again put in Practice by any suchlike Body of this Church I shall only beg one Favour That those who do it will deal plainly and declare that they are not nor do pretend to the  Christians  but  Members of the Church of England  only Or at least that they are just so far Christians as the Original Doctrines and Duties of Christianity are agreeable to those that the XXXIX Articles the Book of Homilies and the CommonPrayerBook contain but no farther And then it will be some small Satisfaction to have the World know that as in Popish Countries Christianity is generally no farther believ'd and obey'd than it is agreeable to the Decrees and Practices of the Church of  Rome  so that in this Protestant this Reform'd Country the Case is the very same Only with this Difference that the former pretends to that Infallibility and Dominion over Conscience which the latter disclaims and by consequence that the latter is of the two in this Matter the most plainly unjustifiable and inexcusable However as to my being condemn'd for asserting what was undeniable and unanswerable we have a famous Parallel Example in the Sacred History For truly  just so it was in the Case of the Protomartyr St  Stephen  all due Allowance for the great difference of the Persons concern'd and of their Circumstances being still made For when the  Jews  were  not able to resist the Wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake  Act VI  c  they drew him into their Consistory and Accus'd him there And when they could not find any fair Reply to the force of his Reasoning  They were cut to the Heart and gnashed upon him with their Teeth  VII  And immediately without any other Formality of Law put him to a violent Death  Then they cried out with a loud Voice and stopped their Ears and ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the City and stoned him  v  Whether this Violence towards me may not end in some Attempts not very different from that Case I cannot tell However I shall venture to use his dying Petition for all my Persecutors  Lord lay not this Sin to their Charge  v  But now if after all the Reader be desirous to know what sort of Answer I should have made to the present Accusation had I had competent time allow'd me I shall plainly tell him in a few Words I intended therein to have stated some of my Opinions more fully and clearly than the Evidence produc'd did inform my Judges And in order to shew that then they were not so contrary to the Doctrine and Settlement of the Church of  England  as they suppos'd I design'd to have insisted on such Heads as these  To have shew'd  That the Protestant Religion in general and the Church of  England  in particular were begun upon this Foot I mean the Acknowledgment of the Churches Errors and the Attempt for the Correction  os the same even with the Hazard of the very Lives themselves of the Reformers  That they are both built on the Foundation of the Holy Scriptures and most Primitive Writers and always own that all Errors when discover'd are to be amended by those Original Standards  That all Protestants and particularly the Members of this Church do unanimously own the Fallibility of all Councils and Churches and so cannot be surpriz'd if in Points never yet brought to a fair and publick Examination some Errors be suppos'd still remaining among them  That accordingly they have generally found Reason to alter their Opinions in several Doctrines of Consequence as our Church has in particular about the Predestinarian Points Nay they have generally even our Church her self found Reason to alter several Practices of Consequence also since the time of the Reformation And so it can seem no Wonder if there should appear Occasion for the like farther Enquiries and Alterations at this Day  That in the grand Point before us that of the  Trinity  it self Our Church sometimes speaks according to those ancient Notions which I advance nay commonly Prays and Practises agreeably thereto So that the Corrections I plead for would rather be the rendring the Church's Language and Practice all of a Piece than the entire Subversion and Alteration of the same  That the most Learned and Impartial both Papists and Protestants and those of our Church in particular have in this last Age been forc'd to leave the vulgar Notions in that Matter and to come still nearer and nearer to that most Primitive and Rational Account which I Plead for As appears by  Erasmus Grotius Petavius Huetius  Dr  Cudworth  Bp  Pearson  Bp  Bull  the Bp of  Gloncester  Mr  Locke  and many others So that my Notions are so far  from New that they are rather the proper and last Result of the Enquiries of the Learned since the Reformation  That since I have taken all along the most Peaceable Christian and Inoffensive Methods of bringing these Important Points to a fair Examination and have still laid my Papers before the Governors of the Church and the Learned Members of it for their Consideration and the necessary Corrections I have no way offended against the Laws of the Land or even the Statutes of the University as to their main Design and Intention which can never be suppos'd to be the Punishment of an Honest and Innocent Man when in so fair quiet and open a manner he Proposes Sacred Books Doctrines and Duties of the Gospel to the serious Consideration of the Christian World However if the Laws of the Kingdom or Statutes of the University be so Expounded as to forbid any thing that the Laws of God and of the Gospel require I know which I am to obey  Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God judge ye For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard  Act IV  These were such Heads as I intended more largely and fully to have pursu'd had I had time allow'd me for my Answer But since I was not afforded that I shall wave the farther Prosecution of them And conclude not only with the Declaration of the Readiness of my Submission to any Punishment which my Governors in any sort do Legally inflict upon me but with my hearty Thanks to the Divine Providence which has dispos'd of me into this Kingdom of Freedom and Liberty where 'tis not very much that by the Laws can be laid upon me sor the sake of my Conscience Where therefore with small Legal Hazard I can greatly promote the true Religion os Christ Jesus And that I am not in  Spain  or  Portugal  or the  like Countries subject to the Terror of a Popish Inquisition wherein the speaking or writing a small Part of what I have here spoken and written would certainly have condemned me to a loathsom Dungeon and to an Ignominious Death The utmost Severities of which I hope I should yet by God's Grace have endur'd rather than have retracted and renounced what upon such full and undoubted Evidence I am entirely satisfy'd is part of the Revelation of God by his Son Christ Jesus  If any Man come to me and hate not his Father and Mother and Wife and Children and Brethren and Sisters yea and his own Life also He cannot be my Disciple And whosoever doth not bear his Cross and come after me cannot be my Disciple  Lu XIV  I End the whole with our Saviour's own Words which in some small degree do now plainly belong to me  Blessed are they which are persecuted for Righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven  Matt V  Which  Blessedness  I own I had rather have a Share in than in all the dangerous and ensnaring Pomp of this Vain and Transitory World  WILL WHISTON  Decemb    APPENDIX  When the University had thus Banished me they seemed somewhat at a loss what they should do farther Nor did they come to any Resolution for near a Year In which time I took the best Advice I could what was fit for me to do And according to that Advice and the Power I had by Mr  Lucas  's Statutes I made a sufficient Deputy Mr  Christopher Hussey  Fellow of  Trinity  College to perform those Duties of my Place in the University which my Banishment made it not fit for me to do my self Who yet found the University in such a Temper that he  never durst venture actually to Read for me Dr  Jenkins  indeed the New Master of St  John  's College was so fair upon my worthy Friend Mr  Biller  's Application to him on my account for his Consent to my Deputy's Reading for me that He Declar'd  He would Consent if the rest of the Heads were willing but not otherwise  Which Answer I took very kindly from him as I think I had reason to do especially when I compare this civil Treatment of his with that of some others For when I once during this interval and I think at the same time stayed at  Cambridge  a few Days and endeavour'd to make the Heads easy in the admission of my Deputy I had a Beadle presently sent to me by Dr  Lany  Master of  Pembroke  Hall the then DeputyVicechancellor to know  How I durst venture to appear even in the Town of  Cambridge  under my Banishment from the University  Nay I was inform'd that One of the Heads said  I might be laid by the Heels for my presumption  About a Year after my Banishment Dr  Lany  who was again DeputyVicechancellor for Sir  Nathaniel Lloyd  the Vicechancellor would never himself consent to it Resolv'd to Proceed to the Election of another Professor and accordingly put up a Paper upon the Doors of the Publick Schools appointing a Day for the filling up my Professorship Which was therein Declared to have been vacated  per bannitionem Gulielmi Whiston  as I think the Words were without any other Deprivation according to Mr  Lucas  's Statutes by which yet alone surely I could be Legally Depriv'd thereof The Person who was Chosen was Mr  Nicolas Sanderson  who has ever since taken upon him to be the Mathematick Professor in my room Thus far the Proceedings of the University were by their own Authority But because they were not of themselves able to eject me out of the Possession of the Lands and Profits of my Professorship which tho' Legally Vested in Trustees  were yet in Fact ever under the Management of the Professor himself They soon apply'd for assistance to the HighCourt of  Chancery  And after the necessary Bills and Answers were over the Cause it self and its real Merits seem'd at last ready for a fair full and publick Hearing for which I justly hoped and had prepared my self accordingly The Points of Law as I all along apprehended were these two  First  Whether an hasty  Banishment  by an Old University Statute without hearing any Legal Exceptions or affording any Council or Time for a proper Defence and Answer to an Accusation was  Statutable  and  Legal Secondly  Whether such Banishment by an Old University Statute if Legal could  Vacate a Professorship  which stood on an intirely different Foundation and where I had the Opinion of Council Learned in the Law that it could have no such effect But instead of any such Hearing we soon feared and found that the LordChancellor  Harcourt  would  take it for granted  without a distinct Hearing that what the Heads of the University had done was within their Power to do and so was done Legally Nay He was pleased tho' unwillingly to give the University  Costs  against me for this very and only Reason as he told the Court that  I had Obliged the University to bring a Cause before him in Judgment which He could not Hear  which was all the Hearing and Determination I had there as to the Legality of my Banishment And as to the other Question which was to me and my Family of much greater moment  viz  Whether such a Banishment would vacate my Mathematick Professorship or not It never came to any thing like a Hearing Only the Lord Chancellor had been pleas'd on a former Occasion to Declare in Court that  Altho' He could not determine a Cause He had not heard Yet He could not but think it strange that a Professor of an  University should be one that  by Banishment  was no Member of that University  However Finding soon that the Torrent was then too strong against me and being promised if I submitted great good Offices with the University by the beforementioned Dr  Lany  who then acted on their behalf I was prevailed on not only to deliver up my Writings and to suffer the Decree to pass against me which were done immediately but also to cast my self wholly upon the Mercy of the University which I did a little after by the following Petition which indeed Dr  Lany  undertook to present and to support on my behalf It was in the Words following  To the Worshipful the  ViceChancellor  and the Reverend the Heads of the University of  Cambridge  the Humble Representation and Petition of  William Whiston  late Professor of the  Mathematicks  in the said University  Sheweth  THAT your Petitioner in Order to render himself capable of being admitted Mathematical Professor did long ago surrender and lose the Vicaridges of  Lowestoft  and  Kessingland  in the Diocese of  Norwich  of a considerably greater Yearly Value than the Lands settled sor the Maintenance of such Professor  That by reason of LandTaxes while your Petitioner was Professor his Income was corsiderably less than either of his Predecessors receiv'd and yet your Petitioner expended in Repairs during the same time near  l  That when with  t any Prejudice to the Estate your Petitioner had caused Timber to be cut sufficient for reinbursing the Moneys so by him expended as well as for the  Repairs then and now necessary your Petitioner was hindred from disposing of any part thereof or Reimbursing himself thereby by the Injunction of the Court of Chancery So that your Petitioner has now been near  l  out of Pocket for some Years which has been a great Hardship on him added to his other Misfortunes  That by your Petitioner's Interest and Application the said Estate has been for these last four Years or thereabouts freed from the former Taxes which tho' it has been of little or no Advantage to himself may be very much so to those that succeed him  That during the Time your Petitioner was Mathematical Professor and before he had the Misfortune of incurring the Displeasure of the University and was Banished from thence He is humbly Confident That according to his Abilities He duly performed the Office of  Mathematical Professor  That your Petitioner's Banishment was not from any Neglect of his Duty as Mathematical Professor but meerly for certain Opinions in Religion which He taking and believing to be True could not Retract without doing the greatest Violence to his Conscience nor without being sensible if he had so done that He should have deserved a much greater Punishment from God than hath or can be inflicted on him by Man  That the University having shewn a Zeal which possibly might have been expected from them for the Established Opinions by Banishing your Petitioner Yet well hoping so long as he bumbly and quietly submitted to their Sentence of Banishment it might have been consistent with the Goodness of the University to have permitted him to enjoy part of the Profits of the said Lands He appointed a sufficient Deputy to perform the same Office as your Petitioner apprehended and was advised by his Council He had a Power to do by the Statutes of the Founder And when the University had thought proper to appoint another to Read the Mathematical Lecture your Petitioner readily offered to have named him his Deputy and to have made a competent Allowance for his Pains therein  That altho' your Petitioner was not indulged so far yet He has not sought any Relief against the said Sentence but has submitted thereto altho' the said Sentence it continuing in force was the only Ground of any Advantage to be taken against your Petitioner as He was advised  That your Petitioner's defending the Suit in  Chancery  against him was not out of any Obstinacy or ill Will to those that prosecuted it or to him for whose Benefit that Suit was brought but out of a Sense of that Justice and Care which your Petitioner owed to his Family whose main Support the Rents of the Lands in Question were and for Preservation whereof your Petitioner was advised by his Council to make such Defence not without Hopes of Success therein  That yet your Petitioner's Friends advising him to relinquish all Legal Advantages and to cast himself upon the Mercy of the University rather than to Contend with them any further And your Petitioner's Council not being averse thereto your Petitioner with all Readiness complied with that Advice and gave Orders accordingly and immediately delivered up the Principal Writings before any Decree for so doing  That your Petitioner does now in pursuance of that Resolution submit to the Decree of the High Court of  Chancery  in the Premises in humble Confidence That according to the Hopes then given to your Petitioner's Friends that the Vicechancellor and the Heads of the same University will have Regard to the Premises and consider his Case To which End your Petitioner maketh this humble Representation thereof And further in all humble manner sheweth  That there is a Clause in the Statutes of Mr  Lucas  's Foundation which directs That such Moderation should be shewed to his Professor that should be deprived without his own Fault That if he had behaved himself Worthily during his Continuance in the Place and had not One Hundred Pounas a Year of his own Estate that He should have a third Part of the Annual Salary during  his Life As by a Copy of the said Clause underwritten appears  That whatever Fault the University has judged your Petitioner Guilty of with Relation to his Opinions in Religion or publick Profession thereof yet your Petitioner having performed the Office of Professor unblameably as He humbly hopes and the said Sentence of Banishment regarding only his said Opinions and not the Discharge of his Office And your Petitioner not having any thing like such Yearly Income as mentioned in the aforecited Clause  Your Petitioner therefore humbly Hopes the University will Judge his Case to come within the Equity of the said Clause and will make him the Allowance therein mentioned or somewhat Equivalent thereto which will be a great Comfort and Relief to your Petitioner and his Family in their present Circumstances  And moreover  Your Petitioner humbly Prays That in Regard of the Premis  s aforesaid the University would be pleased to Remit the Costs Decreed against him and the rather for that the the Court on making the said Decree was pleased twice to Declare  That the University ought not to ask Them  or to that Effect And for that your Petitioner hath chearfully referred himself and doth hereby Refer himself wholly to the Equity and Mercy of the University And He cannot but be in Expectation of a favourable Answer  And Your Petitioner shall Pray  c  And now if the Reader enquire what  Kindness  and  Relief  I met with from the University upon this Petition I mean besides this that they have not yet demanded of me the Costs of the Suit for turning me out as by the Rigor of the Decree in Chancery they might have done he will easily guess at it when I solemnly affirm and I appeal to the Conscience of every Member of that Body now alive that were then concern'd Whether that Affirmation and this whole Account be not the
