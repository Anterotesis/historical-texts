 APRILDAY A BURLETTA IN THREE ACTS  WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR of MIDAS  AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN THE HAYMARKET  THE MUSIC composed by Dr ARNOLD  LONDON  Printed for G KEARSLY No FLEETSTREET  M DCC LXXVII  Extract of a Letter from the AUTHOR to his Friend in LONDON  Dear Sir  THE Interlude of the Magic Girdle which Mr Barthelemon left in my hands for correction furnished me with the first hint of this Drama I send you the original that you may see my great reserve in borrowing from it at the same time humbly begging pardon of the gentleman unknown with whose hasty sketch I have taken so many liberties This  Plot is here totally changed and his Personages thrown into a different cast of character I have availed myself but very sparingly of his words scarce at all of his poetry  I hope he will have the goodness to forgive me for what I have retained and what I have rejected assuring him that he is welcome to use still greater licence with any work of mine  I adopt the laconic Dialogue of Italian Burletta in order to comprise my Fable within the narrow limits of late prescribed by the taste of your audiences This is short enough to  admit their being indulged with some popular Petite Piece after it  I am dear Sir c  DUBLIN  January th  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Don Buffalo  a foolish swaggering cowardly knave supposed Guardian to Cephisa  Mr BANNISTER  Count
