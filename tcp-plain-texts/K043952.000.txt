REHEARSAL OR BAYS in PETTICOATS  SCENE I  A DressingRoom in Mrs  HAZARD'S  House  GATTY  preparing the Toylet  Enter  TOM  with Tea Things  GATTY  _WELL I believe we are at present the most melancholy Family in Town that us'd to be the merriest Since these Devils the Muses as my Lady calls 'em have got into the House they have turn'd her Head and she distracts every body about her She really was once a sweettemper'd Woman but now I can't speak or stir but she flies at me and says I have flurried her out of one of the finest ThoughtsHang her I wish her Farce may be hiss'd off the Stage  TOM  That's but a foolish kind of Wish for if she's so sweettemper'd now what do you think she'll be then  GATTY  I don't care what she'll be for I'm determin'd not to stay with her I am sure she uses me like her Dog  TOM  Does sheThen you are an ungrateful Hussey to complain for she is fonder of that than ever she was of her HusbandI fancy this Farce of her's is horrid Stuff for I observe all her Visitors she reads it to which is indeed every body that comes to the House whisper as they come down Stairs and laugh ready to kill themselves  GATTY  Yes but that's at her Assurance Why do you know 'tis none of her own a Gentleman only lent it her to read he has been ill a great while at  Bath  so she has taken the Advantage of that made some little Alterations had it set to Music and has introduc'd it to the Stage as a Performance of her own  TOM  I hear Mr  Surly  that every body thought she was going to be married to is so enrag'd at her that he'll never speak to her or see her again One of his Footmen told me of it yesterday as a great Secret so I promis'd him never to mention itDon't you hear her Bell ring  Rings  GATTY  Hear her yes yes I hear her but I should have a fine Time on't if I was to go to her as often as she takes it in her Head to ring  Rings again  Ay ay ring away  TOM  Ay ay ring awayI'gad here she comes I with you well off  Exit  Enter Mrs  HAZARD  Mrs HAZARD  Why what is the Meaning I must ring for an Hour and none of ye will come near me ye Animals  GATTY  I was coming as fast as I cou'd  Mrs HAZARD  As fast as you could why you move like a Snail that has been trod upon you creeping CreatureLet me die but she has provok'd me into a fine Simile Come get the Things to dress me instantaneously  Tom  with Tea and Coffee She repeats Recitative  Oh  Corydon c  You  Tom  I'm at Home to no human Being this Morning but Mr  Witling  I've promis'd to carry him to the  Rehearsal  with me  Repeats Recitative  Gatty  waiting with her Cap  GATTY  Madam will you please to have your Cap on  Mrs HAZARD  No you Ideot how durst you interrupt me when you saw me so engag'd As I am a Critic this Creature will distract meGive me my Bottle of SaltsShe has ruin'd one of the finest ConclusionsO  Cor  Lord I can't sing a NoteWhat are you doing  GATTY  Lord Madam I can't find them  Mrs HAZARD  Here's a provoking Devil sees 'em in my Hand and wou'd not tell me of it Get out of my Sight  Repeats Recitative  Why where are you going am I to dress myself  GATTY  Madam Mr  Witling  Enter  WITLING  WITLING  My dear Widow you're hard at it I see Come give me some Tea What is it your Prologue or Epilogue pray  Mrs HAZARD  O Lord dear  Witling  Don't be ridiculous for I'm in a horrid Humour  WITLING  Yes and a horrid Dress too I think Why 'tis almost tenWhat is this your Rehearsal Habiliment  Mrs HAZARD  Why that Creature that you see standing there won't give me any thing to put on  WITLING  Well do you know I have had such a Quarrel with  Frank Surly  upon your Account We met last Night at Lady  Betty Brag  's Routthere was a vast deal of Companyand they were all talking of your new Piece  Mrs HAZARD  So I suppose I was finely worried  WITLING  You shall hear as soon as ever it was mentioned we all burst out a laughing  Mrs HAZARD  You didand pray what did you laugh at  WITLING  Heywhyoh at  Frank Surly  he look'd so like aha ha ha i'gad I can't find a Simile that can give you an Idea of such a Face Oh thinks I my dear you're in a fine Humour to make us some Diversion So says I  Frank  I hear the Match is quite concluded between Mrs  Hazard  and you and that she has fix'd the first Night of her Comedy for your WeddingNightSir says he with a very grave Face you may say what you please of Mrs  Hazard  for as she's going to expose herself she must expect that every Fool will be as impertinent as she is ridiculousbut I would advise you not to mention my Name any more  in that Manner for if you do I shall take it extremely ill Lord says Miss  Giggle  Mr  Surly  how can you be so cross expose herselfI'll swear I believe Mrs  Hazard  can write a very pretty Play for she has a great deal of Wit and HumourWit and Humour says he why there are not ten Women in the Creation that have Sense enough to write a consistent  N B  Marry her I would sooner marry a Woman that had been detected in ten Amours than one who in Defiance to all Advice and without the Pretence that most People write for for every body knows she's a Woman of Fortune will convince the whole World she's an Ideot  Mrs HAZARD  A Bear a Brute let me hear no more of him  WITLING  Yes but I must tell you a very good thing that I said to him  Mrs HAZARD  No that you can't I'm sure  Witling  for you never said a good thing in your Life  WITLING  Nay why shou'd you be so illnatur'd to me I'm sure I took your Part Why says I  Frank  how can you be such a Fool to quarrel with her I wish she lik'd me half so well as I'm sure she does you she should write and be hang'd if she wou'd for any thing I car'd for let them do what they will with her Performance they can't damn her eight hundred a Year  Mrs HAZARD  You said so did you  WITLING  I said soNo Lord ChildHow cou'd you think I cou'd say such a Thing No no to be sure it was said by somebody in the Company But upon Honour I don't know who  Mrs HAZARD  What a Wretch is thisBut he is to carry a Party for me the first Night so I must not quarrel with him  Aside  WITLING  Well but my dear  Hazard  when does your Farce come out  Hrs HAZARD  Why some time next Week this is to be the last Rehearsal and the Managers have promis'd they shall all be dress'd that we may see exactly what Effect it will have  WITLING  Well but don't your Head ach when you think of the first Night hey  Mrs HAZARD  Not in the least the Town never hiss any Thing that is introduc'd to them by a Person of Consequence and Breeding Because they are sure they'll have nothing low  WITLING  Ay but they mayn't be so sure they'll have nothing foolish  Mrs HAZARD  HaWhy perhaps they mayn't find out one so soon as t'other Ha ha ha well let me die if that is not a very good ThingBut 'tis well for me  Witling  the Town don't hear me not that I mean quite what I say neither for to do them Justice they're generally in the right in their Censure tho' sometimes indeed they will out of Humanity forgive an Author Stupidity and overlook his being a Fool provided he will do them the Favour not to be a Beast for which Reason  Witling  I have taken great Care to be delicate I may be dull but I am delicate so that I am not at all afraid of the Town I wish I could say the same of the Performers Lord what pity 'tis the great Tragedy Actors can't sing I'm about a new Thing which I shall call a Burletto which I take from some Incidents in  Don Quixote  that I believe will be as high Humour as was ever brought upon the Stage But then I shall want Actors oh if that dear  Garrick  cou'd but sing what a  Don Quixote  he'd make  WITLING  Don't you think  Barry  wou'd be a better he's so tall you know and so finely made for't If I was to advise I would carry that to  CoventGarden  Mrs HAZARD  CoventGarden  Lord I wou'dn't not think of it it stands in such a bad Air  WITLING  Bad Air  Mrs HAZARD  Ay the Actors can't play there above three Days a Week They have more need of a Physician than a Poet at that House  WITLING  But pray Madam you say you are to call your new Thing a Burletto what is a Burletto  Mrs HAZARD  What is a Burletto why havn't you seen one at the  Haymarket  WITLING  Yes but I don't know what it is for all that  Mrs HAZARD  Don't you why then let me die if I can tell you but I believe it's a kind of poor Relation to an Opera  WITLING  Pray how many Characters have you in this Thing  Mrs HAZARD  Why I have but three for as I was observing there's so few of them that can sing nay I have but two indeed that are rational for I have made one of them mad  WITLING  And who is to act that pray  Mrs HAZARD  Why Mrs  Clive  to be sure tho' I wish she don't spoil it for she's so conceited and insolent that she won't let me teach it her You must know when I told her I had a Part for her in a Performance of mine in the prettiest manner I was able for one must be civil to these sort of People when one wants them says she Indeed Madam I must see the whole Piece for I shall take no Part in a new Thing without chusing that which I think I can  act best I have been a great Sufferer already by the Manager's not doing Justice to my Genius but I hope I shall next Year convince the Town what fine Judgment they have for I intend to play a capital Tragedy Part for my own Benefit  WITLING  And what did you say to her pray  Mrs HAZARD  Say to her why do you think I wou'd venture to expostulate with herNo I desir'd Mr  Garrick  wou'd take her in Hand so he order'd her the Part of the Madwoman directly  WITLING  Well I think the Town will be vastly oblig'd to you for giving them such an Entertainment as I am told it is from every body that has heard it tho' the illnatur'd Part of your Acquaintance say 'tis none of your own  Mrs HAZARD  Why whose do they say it is prayNot yours  Witling  not quite so bad as that I hope No my Motive for writing was really Compassion the Town has been so overwhelmed with Tragedies lately that they are in one entire Fit of the VapoursThey think they love 'em but it's no such Thing I was there one Night this Season at a Tragedy and there was such an universal Yawn in the House that if it had not been for a great Quantity of Drums and Trumpets that most judiciously every now and then came in to their Relief the whole Audience would have fallen asleep  Enter  TOM  TOM  Madam there's a young Miss desires to speak to you upon particular Business  WITLING  Heark'e  Tom  are you sure 'tis a young MissIf 'tis an old one don't let her come up for they are a Sort of Creatures I have a great Aversion to  Mrs HAZARD  Why thou impertinent stupid Wretch did not I bid you deny me to every body don't you know I am going out this Instant  TOM  Madam 'tis not my Fault I was not below and they let her in  Mrs HAZARD  I don't believe there is a Woman in the World has such a Collection of Devils in her House as I have  Enter  MISS  MISS  Mameyour ServantNot to interrupt you  Mrs HAZARD  Yes Miss but you have done thatWhat is your Business pray  MISS  Why MameI was inform'd as how that there was a new Play of your's Mame acoming out upon the Stage with some Singing in't  Mrs HAZARD  Coming out upon the Stage Lord where could this Creature come from Well Miss  MISS  So Mame I have a Desire not that I have any Occasion but 'tis my Fancy Mame to come and sing upon the Stage  Mrs HAZARD  And a very odd Fancy I believe it isWell Miss you say it is your Fancy to sing upon the Stage but pray are you qualified  MISS  O yes Mame I have very good Friends  Mrs HAZARD  This Girl's a NaturalWhy Miss that's a very great Happiness but I believe a good Voice wou'd be more material to your FancyI suppose you have a good Voice  MISS  No Mame I can't say I have much Voice  Mrs HAZARD  Ha ha she's delightful I am glad they let her in Well Miss to be sure then you are a Mistress  MISS  Mamewhat do you mean  Mrs HAZARD  Ha ha I say I imagine you understand Music perfectly well  MISS  No Mame I never learnt in my Life but 'tis my Fancy  WITLING  Miss is a very pretty Girl I wish she'd take a Fancy to me I believe it wou'd answer my Purpose better than singing will her's  Aside  Mrs HAZARD  Well but my Dear as you confess you have neither Voice nor Judgment to be sure you have a particular fine Ear  MISS▪  Yes Mame I've a very good Earthat is when I sing by myself but the Music always puts me out  Mrs HAZARD  Ha ha Well Child you have given an exceeding good Account of yourself and I believe will make a very extraordinary Performer  MISS  Thank you Mame Yes I believe I shall do very well in Time  WITLING  Pray Miss won't you favour us with a Song  MISS  Yes Sir If you please I'll sing  Powerful Guardians of all Nature  I've brought it with me  Mrs HAZARD  Pray let's hear it  Miss sings  Oh fie Miss that will never do you speak your Words as plain as a ParishGirl the Audience will never endure you in this kind of Singing if they understand what you say you must give your Words the  Italian  Accent ChildCome you shall hear me  Mrs  Hazard  sings in the  Italian  manner  There Miss that's the Taste of singing nowBut I must beg you wou'd excuse me at present I'm going to the Playhouse and will certainly speak to the Managers about you for I dare believe you'll make a prodigious Figure upon the Stage  WITLING  That you will indeed MissThe strangest that ever was seen there  Aside  MISS  Sir I thank you Mame I thank you Mame I'll wait on you another Time  Mrs HAZARD  Miss your ServantNo that you shall not do I promise you  Exit  Miss  Enter  TOM  TOM  Madam your Chair has been waiting a great while 'Tis after Ten above half an Hour  Mrs HAZARD  My Stars this driveling Girl has ruin'd me Here  Gatty  get me my Shade I'll go as I am  WITLING  Shan't I set you down  Mrs HAZARD  Oh not

interrupted the  Rehearsal  So Mr  Cross  I'll be denied to every body Well  Witling  how do you like the Playhouse in a Morning  WITLING  Why I think 'tis like a fine Lady it looks best by CandleLight  Mrs HAZARD  But pray Mr  Cross  get every body ready is the Music come  Mr CROSS  Yes Madam the Music has been here this half Hour and every body but Mrs  Clive  and I dare  say she'll not be long for she's very punctual Mr  Beard  and Miss  Thomas  are gone to dress  Mrs HAZARD  Mr  Cross  you have had a great deal of Trouble with this Thing I don't know how I must make you amends

Enter a  SERVANT  SERVANT  Mr  Cross  there's a Person wants to speak to you  Exit Mr  Cross  Mrs HAZARD  Well I'll swear these poor Players have a very slavish Life I wonder how they are able to go through it  Enter  Mr CROSS  Mr CROSS  Madam Mrs  Clive  has sent Word that she can't possibly wait on you this Morning as she's oblig'd to go to some Ladies about her Benefit But you may depend on her being very perfect and ready to perform it whenever you please  Mrs HAZARD  Mr  Cross  what did you say I can't believe what I have heard Mrs  Clive  send me Word she can't come to my  Rehearsal  and is gone to Ladies about her Benefit Sir she shall have no Benefit Mr  Witling  did you ever hear of a Parallel to this Insolence Give me my Copy Sir give me my Copy I'll make Mrs  Clive  repent

Benefit for I'll never come into the Playhouse any more  WITLING  Nay but my dear  Hazard  don't put yourself into such a Passion can't you rehearse her Part yourself I dare say you'll do it better than she can  Mr CROSS  Why Madam if you wou'd be so good as the Music are here and the other Characters dress'd it would be very obliging And if you please to put on Mrs  Clive  's her Dresser is here to attend as she expected her and I believe it will fit you exactly as you're much of her Size  Mrs HAZARD  O yes to be sure it will fit me exactly because I happen to be a Head taller and I hope

Symphony for the Song  AIR  If  Cupid  once the Mind possess  All low Affections cease  No Troubles then can give Distress  No Tumult break the Peace  Oh had I thousand Gifts in Store  Were I of Worlds the Queen  For him I'd covet thousands more  And call Profusion mean    Then let my Swain my Love return  And equal Raptures feel  Nor let his Passions cool or burn  As Fortune winds her Wheel  If his fond Heart I may believe  Immutably secure  No Sorrow then can make me grieve  No Loss can make me poor  RECITATIVE  But see he comesI'll wear a short Disguise  Be false my Tonguebe Hypocrites

length return luxuriant Thought  Return and settle where you ought  Fiz'd by Experience dearly bought  For sweet and useful Ends  Oft did I dread her subtle Care  And oft was jealous tho' secure  What Agonies did I endure  But Love has made amends  CORYDON  Joy were no Joy and Pleasure vain  Were there not Intervals of Pain  The Captive who has felt a Chain  Is doubly blest when free  I view with Transports the Abyss  Which Powers propitious made me miss  And rush with aching Thoughts of Bliss  To Safety and to thee  BOTH  Joy were no Joy and Pleasure vain  Were there not Intervals of Pain  The Captive who has felt a Chain  Is doubly blest when free  'Tis Clouds that make the Sun more bright  'Tis Darkness that sets off the Light  'Tis Sorrow gives to Joy its Height  By Heaven's most kind Decree  CORYDON  Witling  falls asleep  Soft she approachesseek you poplar Glade  And wait beneath the thick embowering Shade  Yourself shall be a Witness to my Truth  Miranda  retires  Enter

 ALBANY ODELOVE  Miss  SIDLE  and Miss  DAWDLE  Miss GIGGLE  My dear Creature I immensely rejoice to find you do you know we have been at your House and could not meet with a Creature that could give the least Account of you Your Servants are all abroad ha ha ha they are certainly the worst Servants in the World ha ha ha Well but my Dear have you done for we must have you with us We are going to one of the breakfasting Places but we don't know which yet for they are all so immensely superb that I can't touch my Breakfast at Home ha ha ha Lord dear Creature what makes you look so miserable your new Thing is'nt a Tragedy is it  Mrs HAZARD  Giggle  I'm astonish'd at you Pray who are all these People you have brought upon me  Miss GIGGLE  Who are they my Dear I'll introduce you to them they're immensely agreeable all of them ha ha ha  Mrs HAZARD  Lookee Miss  Giggle  if they are ever so immense they must not stay here for I'm going to be immensely busy and will not be interrupted  Miss GIGGLE  My dear Creature as to leaving you 'tis not in the Nature of Things I would not go without you for the World Sir  Albany Odelove  Mrs  Hazard  desires to be introduced to you Madam this Gentleman is immensely fond of the Muses and therefore must be agreeable to you Miss  Sidle  Miss  Dawdle  introduces 'em  Mrs HAZARD  Mr  Cross  I want to speak to you I shall run mad  Aside  Miss GIGGLE  Lord  Witling  what's the matter with Mrs  Hazard  She looks as if she could kill me  WITLING  The matter with her ha ha ha why you have interrupted her Rehearsal Ah I could indulge such a Laugh if you'll join with me we shall have the finest Scene in the WorldShe has made me sick to Death with her Stuff and I will be revenged You must know one of the Actresses has disappointed her and she is going to sing her Part herself so the Moment she begins do you burst into a violent Laugh we shall all join with you you may be sure and then you'll see the Consequence  Miss GIGGLE  See nay I believe I shall feel the Consequence for she'll certainly beat us immensely Oh I'll tell  you what let's set  Odelove  upon her to enquire into the Plot of her PlayHe'll plague her to Death for he's immensely foolish  WITLING  Wellthat's an admirable ThoughtMum  Miss GIGGLE  Well but my dear Mrs  Hazard  don't let us interrupt you for we are all immensely fond of a Rehearsal  Miss DAWDLE  Yes so we are indeed Madam immensely  WITLING  So we are immensely  Catches her Hand  Miss DAWDLE  Lord don't paw one so Mr  Witling    Miss GIGGLE  And so this is the Playhouse I'll swear 'tis immensely pretty and all the Music well if there was but a Scene of green Trees we might fancy ourselves at  Ranelagh  ha ha ha  Mrs HAZARD  Why really by the Noise you make and the Nonsense you talk I think you might Lookee Miss  Giggle  I shall be very plain with you if you think it is possible for you to be quiet for Half an Hour I shall be glad of your Company if not I must beg you'd depart  Sir ALBANY  Why really what the Lady says is very pathetic and consequental to the foregoing Part of Miss  Giggle  's Behaviour for when a Person of Parts as we are to suppose this Lady to be is assassinated with Incoherences it is such an Aggravation to our Intellects as does in Fact require supernatural Patience to acquiesce thereto  ALL  Ha ha ha  Miss GIGGLE  Very well Sir  Albany  I'll remember you for thisNo upon Honour now I will be very good I won't interrupt you indeed won't speak another WordO la  Witling  do you know Miss  Lucy Loveshuffle  had such an immense ill Run last Night she bragg'd every thing that came into her Hand and lost every thing she bragg'd'till she really looked as ugly as a Fiend  WITLING  I fancy you won then  Giggle  For I never saw you look so well  Mrs HAZARD  Nay as to that Matter let  Giggle  win or lose it will be pretty much the same thing with her Beauty but come Mr  Cross  pray let us go on Let me see I begin my Recit  ALBANY  Corydon  WITLING  Giggle  I can tell you who's going to be married  Miss SIDLE and Miss DAWDLE  Oh Lord whopray tell us  WITLING  The celebrated Miss  Shrimp  to Lord  Lovelittle  a Man of very great Fortune  Miss DAWDLE  Really well then I think we none of us need to despair  WITLING  Come don't you be envious now for she's a charming Girl and deserves her good Fortune  Miss GIGGLE  Charmingnay then I shall never have done I'm sure she's immensely little  Sir ALBANY  Oh fy Miss that's Nonsense horrid Nonsense immensely little Oh Lord  WITLING  Why to be sure she is rather small that must be allowed she is certainly the least Woman that ever was seen for nothing  Sir ALBANY  Madam as I was not so auspicious as to be here at the Beginning of this Affair will you give me leave to ask you a few Questions  Mrs CROSS  Madam if you won't go on the Music and Performers can't possibly stay any longer  Mrs HAZARD  Why what can I do Mr  Cross  you see how I'm terrified with 'em  WITLING  She begins to be in a FuryLook at her  Giggle  Sir ALBANY  I say Madam will you give me Leave as you're going to entertain the Town that is I mean to endeavour or to attempt to entertain them for let me tell you fair Lady 'tis not an easy thing to bring about If Men who are properly graduated in Learning who have swallow'd the Tincture of a polite Education who as I may say are Hand and Glove with the Classics if such Genius's as I'm describing fail of Success in Dramatical Occurrences or Performances 'tis the same Sense in the Latin what must a poor Lady expect who is ignorant as the Dirt  Mrs HAZARD  Pray Sir how long have they let you out  Sir ALBANY  Therefore I hope you have had the Advice of your Male Acquaintance who will take some Care of your Diction and see that you have observed that great Beauty neglected by most Dramatic Authors of Time and Place  WITLING  Oh Sir  Albany  I'll answer she has taken Care of Time and Place for it will begin about half an Hour after eight and be acted at  Drurylane  TheatreHa ha ha there's Time and Place for you  Mrs HAZARD  And so you're Hand and Glove with the Classics are you Why thou elaborate Idiot how durst you venture to talk to any thing that's RationalConsult my Male Acquaintance I thank my Stars thou art not one of 'em Where did you pick up this Creaturewhat's his NameCan you spell your own Name you ugly Brute  Miss GIGGLE  Oh Lord it will never come to her Singing  Miss SIDLE  Pray Madam will there be any Dancing this Morning  Mrs HAZARD  NoMr  Cross  who let these People in I do assure you I shall complain to the ManagersI have been so plagu'd there's no bearing itI could tear theseI'm unfit for any thing nowSo the Rehearsal must be put off 'till another Morning  WITLING  Ay doand let us go  Mrs HAZARD  Go to  WITLING  To  Ranelagh  I knew you wou'd not name an ungenteel Place  Sir ALBANY  The Lady has been somewhat underbred in her Behaviour to me but as I have a Regard to the Fair  Sex I would have some of you advise her to cry it will give Relief to her Passion  Mrs HAZARD  Sir will you go out of this Place  Sir ALBANY  I protest Madam I will directly  Exit  ALL  Ha ha ha  WITLING  Well but my dear Creature you are not angry with me  Mrs HAZARD  Indeed I am  Witling  and very angry too I don't believe I shall ever speak to you again As for those Things that run about littering the Town and force themselves into all public Places only to shew their Insignificance they are beneath my ResentmentMr  Cross  I'll settle with you when I wou'd have another Rehearsal tho' I am not sure I ever will have anotherI believe I shall tear it to PiecesPray let somebody see if my Chairmen are there  WITLING  Shall I wait on you  Mrs HAZARD  No  Exit  WITLING  Well as Sir  Paul  says Odsbud she's a passionate Woman but her tearing it will only save the Audience  the Trouble of doing it for her Come Ladies will you go I'll see you to your Coach  Mr CROSS  As the Ladies have been disappointed of Mrs  Hazard  's Rehearsal if they please to stay we are going to practise a new Dance  ALL  Oh by all Means  A DANCE  FINIS
