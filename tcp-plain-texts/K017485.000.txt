him who is  SIR  Your most grateful Most Sincere and most obliged Humble Servant  HENRY JONES  POEMS on several Occasions c  A short ESSAY on the Progress of  English  POETRY  TO  Grecian  Numbers  Homer  's Harp was strung  And  Virgil  triumph'd in the  Latin  Song  But  Milton  on  Urania  's Wings did rise  And open'd wide the Curtain of the Skies  By Aid Divine Celestial Scenes he drew  And brought Embattl'd Seraphs in our View  A Flight so high to Mortal ne'er was given  'Till  Milton  sung the mighty War in Heaven  When with Thunder the bless'd Messiah rode  Astonish'd Fiends confess'd their awful God  By Force resistless trembling Hosts he hurl'd  To dreadful Dungeons of the Nether World  Dismay'd in Circles Rebel Angels fell  And sunk beneath the gloomy Shades of Hell  Not so feign'd Gods with ancient Giants strove  When Mortals mock'd the Thunderbolts of  Jove  Those fearful Powers from raging Monsters fled  Whil'st  Egypt  screen'd them from the unwieldy Dread  Our Sacred Bard inflam'd by Angels fir  d  On azure Wings to heav'nly Truths aspir'd  What pass'd above e're this vast World began  Or glittering Stars did light the Seat of Man  When unborn Nature in its Womb did sleep  And sable Darkness veil'd the dusky Deep  When shapeless Matter in jumbl'd Attoms lay  And Hard with Soft and Night was mix'd with Day  Thus sung our  English  Bard in glorious Strains  Whil'st more than  Homer  's Stile his Song sustains  In  Cowly  's Theme the Son of  Jesse  shines  And mourning  David  's lovely in his Lines  He whom God to Kingly Power did call  Whose Wings preserv'd him from the Rage of  Saul  Such pious Charms in his bright Soul did raise  Which flam'd a glowing and continued Blaze  Surpriz'd with Wonder in his Songs we meet  A flowing Stream and endless Source of Wit  To  Cromwell  's Fame sweet  Waller  's Lyre was strung  Th' Usurper lives because the Poet Sung  His manly Notes so lofty and sublime  Made hardy Treason with a Lustre shine  When  Waller  did in melting Measures sing  He lull'd th' Execution of a King  Waller  sure turn'd our  English  Hearts to Stone  When careless of a King and empty Throne  Their harden'd Souls remorseless did rejoice  And Treason triumph'd in the publick Choice  Our  Dryden  next can we his Praise refuse  In Honour of his high exalted  Muse  To him shall future Times their Thanks express  For well chose Tales and  Virgil  's  English  Verse  The noble  Muse  of  Buckhurst  on her Wing  Taught humble  Prior  in sweet Notes to sing  Our ancient Bards he tuned to modern Lays  To  Buckhurst  's Glory and to  Prior  's Praise  Whil'st  Phoebus  does his dazling Circles run  Our Isle will boast the Name of  Addison  His Numbers equal all old Poets knew  In lofty Strains he far exceeds the new  In his bold Scenes the  Roman  Virtues shine  And  Cato  's Soul appears in every Line  Triumphant in his Country's native Strain  Paints  Ros'mond  's Fate and  Marlborough  's Campaign  Harmonious  Congreve  the softest  Muse  inspir'd  Congreve  by all the tuneful Throng admir'd  Around his Head immortal Bays shall bloom  For Fame with him laments  Pastora  's Gloom  To  Parnel  's Praise may every Tongue combine  For flowing Sweetness and his Songs divine  In sprightly Numbers and a melting Strain  We taste the Treasures of his dulcid Vein  These happy Bards did living Crowns acquire  Immortal Fame transmits their glorious Fire  The  Muses  still with chearful Aspects smile  With verdant Laurels blooming in our Isle  Since tuneful  Pope  his Harp from  Homer  strung  To sound the Beauties of our copious Tongue  His matchless Pen displays to vulgar View  What Nature's Force and  English  Words could do  O  Muse  indulgent lend an equal Strain  To sing harmonious Numbers to the  Dean  Far be the Day when Mankind are bereft  Of thy bold Patriot Pen Immortal  Swift  For thee above some glorious Throne remains  Who b  vely broke thy Country's  brazen Chains  And did'st with great and virtuous Courage join  To baffle  Wood  and sink his drossy Coin  To speak thy Merit in my humble View  Thou art our  Horace  and  Mecenas  too  Let  Ireland  triumph in her Laurel'd Son  That to his Country has such Honours done  Beneath his Shade the blooming Youth appears  Mature in Wit but slender yet in Years  His rising Genius and his envy'd Name  Bespeak his Glory in the Rolls of Fame  In groveling Numbers thus I'd fain declare  The Progress of the sweet tongu'd  Muses  here  With trembling Pinions and a feeble Quill  I strove in vain to mount the sacred Hill  The distant Top disturbs my aking Sight  Retards my Progress and corrects my Flight  On the ROTUND erected by  Mervyn Pratt  Esq  WIthin this Dome each curious Eye may view  What ancient  Greeks  and learned  Romans  knew  Here Columns plac'd in stately Order stand  And proudly boast the skilful Artist's Hand  Their spiral Heads  Ionick  Stile displays  The Artist's Pride but more the Master's Praise  Their Shafts a female Comeliness express  And speak the Beauties of a  Grecian  Dress  The fretted Roof next does the Eye engage  A lively Emblem of  Augustus'  Age  When  Marcus  did the lofty  Pantheon  rear  For  Rome  's immortal Gods and plac'd them there  A Circle here in reverend Form appears  The ancient Virtue of two thousand Years  Whose Name's as glorious as the rising Day  Their Fame still bright'ning on the moulded Clay  Hence also from their awful Busts we learn  How mighty Heroes blooming Wreaths did earn  How  Scipio  conquer'd how  Alcides  fought  Faustina  charm'd and wise  Aurelius  taught  Here fated  Meleager  's Flame we mourn  A Mother's Furies his too early Urn  Seneca  shining in the Rolls of Fame  His Precepts blast a wreched Tyrant's Name  Sublime his Morals his Reas'ning's refin'd  Of Force to soften bloody  Nero  's Mind  The Sage in vain the fruitless Task did try  And gain'd at last an easier Way to die  Plato  divine by heavenly Ray inspir'd  For Man's Instruction was so greatly fir'd  Through Nature's Mists pointed to bless'd Aboads  And taught th'immortal Soul in spight of Heathen Gods  These awful Busts do grace thy curious Dome  Who've search'd the polish'd Stores of  Greece  and  Rome  Here you've plac'd what ancient Story told  A Treasure far more precious than their Gold  O'er rugged  Alps  you sought the nobler Prize  And courted Dangers to become more wise  Nor slightly curious did you thither go  To breath new Air or make an empty Show  As many do o'er spacious Regions roam  Not bringing Art but various Vices home·  Not so thy virtuous Judgment thee inclin'd  Their Ore you chose but left the Dross behind  Thy Skill has rear'd a Pattern in our Land  Since on thy Fort we see thy  Pantheon  stand  A lively Image of  Agrippa  's Toil  Appears triumphant in our Northern Soil  Hibernia  now with joyful Pride may see  Vitruvian  Taste and  Greek  display'd by thee  Accept this Tribute of an humble  Muse  Nor do thy Praise in feeble Strains refuse  To a Young Gentleman of Fortune on Commencing Holy Orders  SAY virtuous Youth what does thy Mind inspire  To shun the World and from its Cares retire  Scorning this frail and transient vain Abode  Inlisted in the Service of thy God  The happier Choice is to thy Wishes given  To be an early Voluntier for Heaven  No Pomp of Life could force thee to refrain  The meek  Messiah  and his Pilgrim's Train  Beneath his Banner the Tempter to repel  And snatch the Sinner from the Jaws of Hell  With pious Valour wield the Ghostly Sword  And conquer  Satan  by thy Master's Word  His dread Commands do thou observe and keep  And be a watchful Pastor to his Sheep  Against their Foe sustain th' important Strife  And to thy Flock dispense the Bread of Life  Beware that they the wily Wolf withstand  And feed 'em from thy consecrating Hand  Let thy good Deeds a shining Lamp still burn  And more by Practise than by Preaching turn  Not once a Week content thy Charge to see  Let all thy Life one constant Sermon be  That when thy Lord shall in the Clouds appear  Thy Head a Crown of Righteousness may wear  And then with him in pious Joy shall boast  Behold of those you gave me none are lost  Be this thy Task let this thy Hours employ  Give Sinners Comfort and give Angels Joy  In thy bless'd Function chearfully rejoice  Thy Work not by Necessity but Choice  A pious  Atlas  bear th' incumbent Load  And be a Pillar in the House of God  On Faith's firm Basis ever rest secure  And every Shock of changing Time endure  Sedate in Life's precarious Windings go  Not tost by various Interests to and fro  To sacred Dignities do thou aspire  And be thy Master's and thy Flock's Desire  That e're thy Honours in the Dust be laid  The sacred Mitre may adorn thy Head  Be as a skilful Pilot on this stormy Sea  To steer thy Vessel in the faithful Way  That when this Life's tempestuous Course it past  You may rest secure upon the wish'd for Coast  To a Friend in Sickness  WHEN late the sad Account I heard  That racking Pains disturb'd thy Rest  My anxious Soul thy Sorrow shar'd  My Heart beat thick within my Breast  O God I said thy Mercy show  Let Angels guard my Friend  Eternal King avert the Blow  And round his Bed thy Comfort send  Let Health her azure Wings expand  And let us greet the welcome Dove  O send that Carrier from thy Hand  And all his bitter Pangs remove  With earnest Wish I thus implor'd  The mighty One that governs all  And for thy Sake I low ador'd  And for thy Ease did humbly call  Let chearful Hope thy Soul inspire  Let Faith sustain thy troubled Mind  One contrite Tear will quench his Ire  And move thy Maker to be kind·  No hallow'd Straws nor Bones you need  No Virgin's Milk nor Merits vain  One rosy Drop which Christ did bleed  Will sooth thy Sorrow and thy Pain  To a Gentleman who promis'd his Letter of Recommendation  NO Courtdependant in his Corner stands  When flush'd with Hopes to kiss his Patron's Hand  Who grudges neither Time nor Pains the while  If he procures the Favour of a Smile  No Country Curate at Levee does appear  When big with Hopes of fifty Pound a Year  With meagre Looks and many a cringing Scrape  To show the Merits of his tatter'd Crape  No poor Cadee impatient of a Post  Whose Monty's spent and nearest Friends are lost  That now has nothing left to shew him big  But shatter'd Ruffles and a powder'd Wigg  Believe me Sir not one of all the three  Has stronger Hopes or wilder Thoughts than me  But still I hope my Views are founded better  Since I'm to get your kind and friendly Letter  And on my Word I'll gratefully receive it  And humbly thank the worthy Hand that gave it  So now I value not the Rogues a Rush  I hope to make a Fortune of my Brush  To a Gentleman who promised me the Works of Mr  Addison  NO stripling puny Preist desires more  To steal from  Austins  or from  Grotius'  Store  When knotty Themes his muddy Brains has vext  And he is puzl'd to pursue his Text  No unfledg'd Lawyer essaying at the Bar  With empty HeadPiece and a noisy Jar  Was e'er so sorely anxious to invoke  Some speedy Aid from  Bracton  or from  Coke  No plaugy Quack that of Success despairs  Who's trembling for his Credit and his Ears  And when for both he's wofully afraid  He flies for Help to  Galen  or to  Mede  No Bard alas divested of his Bays  On whom a Swarm of hungry Criticks preys  When charg'd with Spleen and for his latest Shift  He makes Address to  Horace  or to  Swift  Not one of all the Donny Rogues I nam'd  When in the Dumps and of their Works asham'd  Did ever long with more intense Concern  T' improve their Knowledge and their Arts to learn  Than I to read those Lines of  Addison  Where  Britons  beat and fairy  Frenchmen  run  Who knows when I 've paus'd a while his Theme  But I next Year may grow like him in Fame  If former Friends their triple League advance  By  Jove  I'll write and they shall cudgel  France  When like a Wren upon his Wings I raise  With  England  's Fame I'll mix your worthy Praise  A short Pastoral  REmember my  Mira  when I'm gone away  Those pleasant sweet Arbours where once we did play  Likewise the Meads the Valleys the Brooks  Whose murmuring Streams reflected your Looks  Think of those Thickets where we did beguile  The Noons burning Rays and the  Meridian  Toil  Forget not the Flowers where we used to sit  Remember the Roses which blush'd at your Feet  When the proud Daisies their Leaves did expand  And seem'd to rejoice when touch'd by your Hand  O call then to mind those amorous Hours  We spent with such Joy in the Jessamine Bowers  When Mirth and Amusement made us both gay  And innocent Pleasures deluded the Day  'Till Evening's cool Breezes invited us forth  To hear the Flocks bleating and see the Lambs sport  And smell the sweet Gales that were fann'd from each Bush  To hear the Notes sung by the Lark and the Thrush  Those warbling Strains that our Loves did inspire  Which rung through the Grove by the feathered Quire  Remember the Rivul'ts which smoothly did glide  When we pass'd pleasantly by their Banks Side  And you in sweet Humour would oftentimes say  My Love shall as lasting as true be as they  When chearfully proffer'd and promis'd such Bliss  I often embolden'd would steal a sweet Kiss  Whil'st you with a Blush would seem to be coy  And patting my Cheek you'd call me bold Boy  Can you my dear Nymph for ever forget  When at the Sheep Fold one Evening we met  When  Phoebus  was sinking to  Thetis  's Bed  And  Cinthia  was rearing her Silver pale Head  When lending your Hand to help a weak Lamb  You tenderly led him to suckle his Dam  Surpriz'd at my Presence you seem'd much afraid  And bid me begone not injure a Maid  Startl'd a little I soon turn'd away  But saw your bright Eyes invited my Stay  Tempted by Beauty your Looks and your Charms  And wing'd with Desire I flew to your Arms  Where lost in Delight your Bosom I press'd  But Night Love and you can tell all the rest  Remember my Charmer remember what past  And let thy Affections for ever then last  Let Love in my  Mira  unspotted still burn  And let her be faithful 'till  Colin  return  On  Christmas  Day  HAIL auspicious Day whose Dawn gave Birth  To him who conquer'd Death and Hell  Welcome bless'd Morn that brought a God to Earth  A God with sinful Dust to dwell  And thou Refulgent Star whose glorious Ray  Did'st usher in the Sun of Peace  And gave the Glimpses of Eternal Day  To  Adam  's dark and wandering Race  When the bright Host inspir'd with holy Zeal  Did the sweet Heav'nly Message bring  And to the simple Shepherds did reveal  The new born Prophet Priest and King  He equal to the alltremenduous Name  Assum'd the Form of sinful Man  Vail'd in the Vesture of our humane Frame  His Work of peerless Love began  He who rules the Stars the copious Globe and Hell  To whom the Seraphs sing above  For us did in a sordid Manger dwell  O Mirrour of Almighty Love  In holy Raptures let our Souls arise  No earthly Clogs our Flight delay  And with the Altar's hallow'd Sacrifice  Adore the Author of this Day  To the Rt Hon Lord  Kingsland  WHat humble Tribute shall the  Muse  afford  To hail her Patron and approach her Lord  What melting flowing Numbers shall she find  To speak the Transports of a ravish'd Mind  In Notes unknown to raise her rural Lays  And sing of Virtue and to  Kingsland  's Praise  The noble Theme my joyful Fancy fires  Inflames my Genius and my Soul inspires  On lofty Pinnions boldly now I soar  Attempting Heights I never sought before  So from her Nest th' unfledged Lark does try  To spread her Wings and fearful learns to fly  With feeble Strokes she fans the nether Air  Nor dares to mount witheld by native Fear  'Till warm'd to Strength by  Phoebus'  genial Ray  She wings the  Aether  and explores the Day  Now let  Hibernia  's laurel'd Sons rejoice  And crown their Wishes in their Patron's Choice  In him secure Politeness still shall thrive  And Arts and Learning in his Race shall live  Those noble Pledges for some future Age  To nurse the Hero and support the Stage  Reform the Coxcomb and reclaim the Fool  Refine the Genius and improve the Soul  Hail bright Pair in sacred Union join'd  To be the Darling of each others Mind  Enjoy those Banquets virtuous Love can give  Still feast on Bliss and for each other live  May soft Content improving new Delights  Smile on your Days and crown with Joy your Nights  May Fate propitious downy Pleasures shed  And Genial Sweets surround your nuptial Bed  That Scene of Raptures where Love's sacred Fire  Inflames new Bliss and kindles chaste Desire  Where ming'ling Minds in Ecstacy are lost  For blended Souls refine Fruition most  From that pure Source where ev'ry Grace accords  May issue Heroes and a Race of Lords  Let after Times admire their shining Fame  And distant Years revere a  Barnwall  's Name  Whose noble Soul no earthly Toys can move  From sacred Honour or his Maker's Love  The following Lines are humbly in∣scribed to the Hon  Tho Coote  Esq  AS a tir'd Pilgrim long by Tempests toss'd  With chearful Eyes beholds his native Coast  Replete with Joy he views the welcome Shoar  Where safe repos'd he dreads the Waves no more  His Feet impatient seek the peaceful Soil  Where lull'd at Ease he fears no future Toil  So longs the virtuous Man for heavenly Ease  And waits with Joy the Evening of his Days  When well discharg'd of e'ery Earthly Load  His Soul's on Wing to rest secure with God  His Mind enlarg'd from all precarious Strife  He feells the Transports of a well spent Life  Such Bliss rewards his painful Labours past  And sooths his Toils with Hopes of heavenly Rest  Rejoice good Man the Hour will shortly come  When Angels waft thee to thy happy Home  Then shall thy Pains to pious Ends design'd  Immortal Sweets in heavenly Mansions find  O glorious Day when Conscience sets thee free  And  Euge bene  is pronounc'd to thee  Blame not the Essay of a willing  Muse  Which would thy Virtue for her Subject chuse▪  With gentle Censure view each feeble Line  Excuse th' Attempt nor blame the weak Design  O could my slender low and feeble Vein  Describe thy Goodness in a proper Strain  How would my ravish'd  Muse  thy Fame rehearse  And hope to be immortal in such Verse  To praise thy Worth whom shall I most commend  The noble Patriot or the worthy Friend  Since both conspicuous in thy Life we see  With open Candour and a Temper free  Thy good Endeavours daily aim this End  To serve thy Country and regard thy Friend  To both your Bounty and your Wish you give  Nor for yourself but for their Welfare live  Thy steady Mind unmov'd in Changes stood  And still thy Actions aim the publick Good  To thee th' oppress'd for quick Redress apply'd  Nor was their Cause tho' poor by thee deny'd  With thee impartial Justice did prevail  To poize the Ballance in an equal Scale  Thy awful Hand was by the unruly fear'd  As thy good Name is by the Just rever'd  So once the Father of the  Roman  State  Incurr'd the Glory of a Tyrant's Hate  No adverse Blast could shock his stedfast Soul  Pointing to Virtue as her constant Pole  No courtly Pomps could his great Mind ensnare  His Country's Cause was still his nearest Care  Like him for a Kingdom's Good you daily Toil  And shines the  Cato  of a suffering Isle  Many has thy Hand from dreadful Wants preserv'd  Thy Hand which gives Industry her Reward  Snatching the Needy from Defraud and Stealth  You made 'em virtuous and you gave them Wealth▪  Thy Bounty does a double Good impart  Improve the Mind and humanize the Heart  Their grateful Prayers like Incense doth arise  And wafts on high thy Morning Sacrifice  When mov'd by friendly Love you deign to come  And with thy Presence chear thy best lov'd Home  The eager Throng in Emulation live  And gazing Crowds their Acclamations give  A general Joy in every Face appears  And hoary Sires assume their youthful Years  The Infants in their Mothers Arms do wait  And strive to bliss thee as they learn to speak  So pious  Job  divine Applause did meet  When Numbers hail'd his Presence in each Street  With R  pture in thy late decline of Days  Enjoy thy Children and thy Country's Praise  Behold the Offspring of thy chaste Embrace  The hopeful Pledges of thy virtuous Race  As Branches blooming from the Cedar Tree  Imbibe a pious Odour still from thee  So  Isr'el  's Sons the Fathers of each Tribe  Enjoy'd the Gifts a Patriarch did divide  When round his Couch each weeping Child did stand  And took the Blessings from his dying Hand  And so may thou when Heaven appoints the Day  Thy Soul to Bliss shall wing its pearly Way  Thy latest Legacy of Love dispense  And in the Arms of Peace depart from hence  An Epitaph on  Steven Taffe  Esq  ENough O Grave now fill thy greedy Womb  Awake ye Dead and give the Worthy Room  Acquired Fame on solid Basis stand  The Virtuous ev'n Fate and Fame commands  Illustrious Consorts grac'd his happy Life  And smiling Fortune crown'd him in a Wise  But Earthly Joys are transient in their Stay  By Death eclips'd a Night obscures their Day  'Till that glorious gilded Morn is come  When happy Saints receive their final Doom  The meeting Atoms from the Tomb shall rise  If Mortals sleep yet Virtue never dies  From a Gentleman to his Mistress  HOW long my Nymph shall I complain  And charge thee  Lesbia  with Disdain  When will thy Heart to Love incline  And ease this scorching Breast of mine  A warmer Flame a purer Fire  The God of Love did ne'er inspire  Than in my Bosom burns for thee  And shall increase eternally  Ah must I then repine in Care  And fill my Mind with black Despair  Or shall I think that partial Fate  Decrees no Bliss but for the Great  Can it the Beam unequal hold  And sink the Scale with drossy Gold  Must none enjoy those melting Charms  Or raste the Heaven within those Arms  But he whom Fortune ever blind  Did in her fickle Mazes find  What she profusely heap  to Day  To Morrow's Dawn may snatch away  When Riches spread their downy Wings  And all the Ores of  India  brings  If shining Dust in Heaps arise  To glut the grov'ling Miser's Eyes  He rowls supine amid'st his Stores  His sordid Soul the Dust adores  He fondly believes his Bliss secure  And thinks his Joys will still endure  Nor dreams that Fortune in an Hour  Can all his Wealth and Hopes devour  His boasted Claim is just as good  Who vaunts of Fame and noble Blood  For whence can he derive his Race  Or higher his long Lineage trace  Than when the senseless Clay began  To glow with Life and warm to Man  The Offspring of the eldest Pair  Of Honour held an equal Share  Except what Nature claim'd as due  No other Titles then they knew  The Springs were at the Source the same  Began alike their Course of Fame  But some through clearer Channels past  And seem'd more noble than the rest  'Tis Time the mighty Change does bring  Which lifts the Peasant to be King  The shifting Dame can tumble down  The Regal Scepter and the Crown  In such Confusions often tost  Honour's gone Distinction's lost  Immortal Love shall higher rise  And live refin'd above the Skies  When Wealth and Honour's vanish'd here  Love will reign triumphant there  My charming Maid lay by thy Art  And take this Guest into thy Heart  Nor longer spurn a dying Swain  Who triumphs only in his Chain  Forbear by Times my Hopes to Kill  And be not thus so fickle still  O wear those Smiles which Nature gave  And scorn t' insult thy captive Slave  Disdain to make vain Wealth thy Boast  But pity him who loves thee most  On Painting  THE Kind'red  Muse  resigns her Bays  And fain would soar in notes Divine  To sing the Magic Pencil's Praise  And make the glowing Canvass shine  See conscious Nature yields the Prize  And blushing views her Art outdone  Whilst rowling years their Glories rise  Who have immortal Laurels won  My grateful  Muse  cannot refrain  But gladly tunes her humble Lyre  And dedicates each chearful Strain  To the fam'd PAINTER'S hallow'd Fire  Hail bright Art by Heav'n ordain'd  Th' exalted Force of Skill sublime  Since by thy Strokes is still retain'd  The mighty Deeds of ancient Time  When this vast World in Chaos lay  E're yet the formless Mass was chang'd  When gloomy Night was mix'd with Day  Before the rowling Orbs were rang'd  Th' Almighty Artist shew'd his Skill  The wide Expanse his Canvass made  The flowing Pencil of his Will  Painted Lights Etherial Shade  With stronger Touch he form'd the Stars  In grosser Grounds the Earth he laid  The surging Deep his Skill declares  His Landskip is the woody Shade  Then Man compleats the vast Design  The last of all Creation born  His Face came nearest to Divine  And best display'd his Maker's Form  The Power beheld him with Delight  And quickly saw that Man must die  When lost in Shades of gloomy Night  His fleeting Soul from hence must fly  His Bounty mov'd him to impart  A Portion of 's Creative Skill  He then infus'd the Painter's Art  Inspir'd the Poet's deathless Quill  Hand in Hand  Olympus  's Top they chose  And always quaff  Castalian  Spring  Where  Virgil  's Laurel ever grows  And  Titian  's Fame shall ever ring  The Sister Sciences do thrive  In Arts refin'd and sacred Love  Their blooming Wreaths are still alive  The latest Test of Time to prove  Whil'st Mortals view the rising Sun  Prepar'd his Radiant Course to go  The World will praise the bright  Lebrun  And speak the Fame of  Angelo  Great  Urben Reuben  and  Vandike  Such lasting Monuments did raise  Which ever will the Fancy strike  And speak their own immortal Praise  O happy  Kneller  by whom we see  A Royal Race of Kings display'd  A deathless Pledge to them and thee  Preserv'd by thy delusive Shade  Thy Strokes secur'd shall ever shine  In spight of mouldering Years  Still guarded by each golden Line  That in thy  Addie  's Page appears  To  Jervice  now do Lords resort  And Ladies for his Leisure wait  His Skill is valued much at Court  Himself carress'd by all the Great  Then let us fill a briming Bowl  To keep our Patrons still in Mind  Since Wine gives Wings unto the Soul  We scorn a Genius that's confind  An Elegy on little  Meredy  SHame on thee Death and thy remorseless Dart  Which found a Passage to his harmless Heart  And quench'd the Vigour of that vital Flame  Whose Heat gave Birth to many a tuneful Theme  Could not his Wit restrain thy frozen Hand  Nor holy Rhimes thy mortal Sting withstand  Ah no nor Wit nor Piety could save  His puny Carcass from the greedy Grave  Lament you Sons of  Phoebus  now and mourn  And let your Tears bedew his little Urn  No more alas in witty Verse he'll talk  Which lack'd no Feet although he ne'er could walk  But Wings he had and mounted high at Will  On wooden Pinions to  Parnassus'  Hill  Late in the Town he seldom did appear  Unless retarded by a Dose of Beer  And then indeed he never grudg'd to stay  And crack his Crock 'till near the Break of Day  When  Leland  's Liquor warm'd his nimble Brains  He touch'd the Reed and sung his merry Strains  How sweetly would he tune each Note and Lay  To sing of  Easter  or on  Christmas  Day  And O what pious Charms did sweetly shine  In every Stanza of his Songs divine  In Odes and Elegies he did excel  And told a mournful Story wond'rous well  Indeed he did for all can tell the some  Who saw his Songs of  Charity  and  Fame  The constant Labour of his Hand and Rod  Was training Children in the Fear of God  It's hard to tell what Pains he chiefly took  To make them pious or to mind their Book  The hapless Youth that stir'd his Mind to Anger  Felt the Fury of his crooked Finger  When fast he grip'd'em by the ButtonHole  And shew'd the tart Discipline of his School  The Logwood Ruler with a weighty Blow  Repell'd the Nails that dare indecent grow  Besides he took such good diligent Care  That Boys should black their Shoes and comb their Hair  What Parents then could e'er begrudge him  Sterling  He taught their Sons such Manners with their Learning  A Clark he was and did Devotion cherish  But seldom said  Amen  in  Mary  's Parish  Th' indulgent Priest to ease his weekly Cares  To  Peter  's sent him still to say his Prayers  Loth his Brother's pious Flock to hinder  And plaugy sparing of his PulpitTimb  r  In vain he strove to save his Waste of Breath  His little Organs were untun'd by Death  Now he's gone where we must follow after  And left his Care to serious  Billy Carter  May these poor Lines be seen in his Behalf  The next shall be his humble Epitaph  Beneath this Sod he silent lies  Who once crack'd many a Joke  His Bulk tho' but a Pigmie Size  With Gyant's Wit he always spoke  His little Body's now at Rest  The happy Soul to Heaven is fled  We'll hear no more his merry Jest  For Oh' alack a day he's dead  On the Sawyers Procession  BEhold my  Muse  nor dread the Critick's Claw  But sound thy Notes in  Chorus  to the  Saw  Hoarse as itself may all thy Numbers flow  In sturdy Strains to praise the gallant Show  Nor care a Fig what Wits do frown or smile  But tune thy Distichs to the  Lyrick  File  Thence thy Scale of grateing Musick bring  Nor weak nor faintly of the  Sawyers  sing  Loud as themselves when e'rey jarring Stroke  Does rend the Texture of some knotted Oak  O may my Lines produce such busling Stir  As when their Arms divide the crack'ling Fir  To mike their Worth in lofty Sonnets shine  I scorn the  Compass  or the  Chalking Line  Disdaining Method in my daring Song  By Rule of Thumb I fear not to run wrong  Tho' I deal with Judges of both Rhime and Wit  Because their Station's always in the PIT  Yet like the most who fill that Place we know  Their Sense is sometimes high and sometimes low  This Truth indeed confess I freely must  We're all beholden to their friendly Dust  For that which serves to cool their sweaty Feet  Preserves the Wine which warms the Poets Wit  Those sacred Atoms form a funeral Bed  And  Sawyers  Dust is buried with the Dead  But see themselves a Train and sprightly Band  That does our Wonder and Surprise command  See see they march in gaudy proud Array  With various Ribbonds glittering in the Day  Behold their Arms which rends the massy Beam  And pulls and hauls like Horses in a Team  With martial Order move in Pomp along  A dreadful Bluff and well disciplin'd Throng  The cutting Ax appears serenely bold  An endless War with Blocks and Boards to hold  The gaping Crowd their manly Praises speak  And  Creeping Joyners  in their Levee wait  With craving Visage at their Elbow stand  And begs the Labour of their nervous Hand  On them the Herd of hungry Starvlings wait  Like Beggars mumping at some great Man's Gate  How pitiful the filly  Chips  appear  And cringing come for some of their  Phineer  And sadly tell their heavy mournful Tale  When forc'd to idle for some twocut Deal  From Morn till Noon the splendid Gang we meet  In solemn Motion pass through every Street  Then all agree with fierce accord Repair  To cram their Craws with good and wholsome Fare  For  Ax  and  Wedge  they wield the  Knife  and  Fork  Instead of  Saws  their  Teeth  begin to work  A dreadful Carnage ends the gorging Day  And stuff'd with Triumph homeward reel their Way  A Song to the Tune of  TweedSide  WHat Charms do surround thy fair Form  What Beauties are glanc'd from thine Eyes  The Graces thy Face do adorn  Our Senses and Souls do surprise  Sweet Fragrance ambrosial and gay  With Innocence chaste and serene  Sit smiling around thee each Day  A ravishing Sight to be seen  The Nightingale chimes to thy Voice  The  Syrens  do yield to thy Song  With Ecchoes the Groves do rejoice  Thy Musick the Swains have undone  Thy Mein so erect fair and tall  Such winning Attraction displays  Thy Mind the best Beauty of all  My Wish and Affections does raise  Thou peerless and sweet killing Dame  What  Cupids  do bask on thy Brow  Their Shafts do augment my sad Pain  O quickly then grant me your Love  Suspend me no longer in Pain  But sweetly vouchsafe me a Smile  Nor let my Soul sigh thus in vain  Nor yet my fond Fancy beguile  Come with me my Maid to yon Grove  Where Nymphs with their Swains do resort  Whose Bowers invite us to Love  Where  Cupids  do revel and sport  In Bliss we'll enjoy the long Day  Our Flocks will be feeding close by  Their Lambkins around us will play  No Monarch's so happy as we  A Song to the Tune of  Bonny Jane  WHen softest Slumbers lull'd my Pain  And downy Sleep becalm'd my Breast  Free from Love's tyrannick Chain  To sooth my Cares in balmy Rest  The wily God withdrew his Dart  That silent lonely Moment chose  To ease a while my bleeding Heart  And give my aking Sense repose  But ah how vain the short respite  The busy mocking Boy bestows  Returning with redoubl'd might  His dreadful Shaft unerring throws  My fleeting fancy on the Wing  Delusive Ideas wrought  Her lovely Image soon did bring  And rais'd the fair one in my thought  She seem'd some Being from above  Her melting presence shone Divine  Her mein exprest the Queen of Love  Her radiant Eyes like Stars did shine  What raptures fill'd my ravish'd mind  When I beheld her Angel's form  Her glancing smiles bespoke her kind  And hid alas her killing scorn  With winged Arms I quickly flew  To grasp her to my melting Heart  Unhappy Swain I little knew  My coming woe and future smart  With sullen frowns and haughty Face  She shew'd her proud and strange Surprize  And turning from my fond embrace  She veil'd the Lustre of her Eyes  So o'er the face of  April  Sun  Some dark and gloomy Cloud is spread  Which blots the chearful ray at Noon  And fills the Shepherds Heart with dread  Or as a Merchant from the Shore  Who discrys the precious Sail  When pregnant with the pearly Ore  And wafted by a peaceful Gale  With joy he waits the welcome Ship  And views her from the verdant Brink  Glide smoothly through the yeilding Deep  And in one fatal Moment sink  Like him bereav'd and in despair  With grief I loudly did complain  And in my Transports beat the Air  But gladly found it was a Dream  A Song to the Tune of  Bony Broom  SINCE love first hurl'd his golden Dart  And taught his Shafts to flie  Or wounded Swains did feel his Smart  None felt it more than I  The sightless Boy has thrill'd me through  His Arrows pierc'd my Breast  The fatal Aim he took too true  Which robs my Soul of Rest  My boiling Blood in rage doth move  Through all my Veins doth run  Still thronging to the seat of Love  It's flame hath me undone  The tedious Nights I wake with Care  No slumbers close my Eyes  Still thinking of my charming Fair  'Till Day's bright Beams arise  In her dear Breast my Soul doth live  Her breath's my vital Air  Her smiles alone can Comfort give  And sooth my killing care  But O she Frowns when I implore  And smiles at all my grief  She scorns alass whom I adore  Nor yields the least Relief  But God of love espouse my part  And give her equal Pain  O make her Sharer in my Smart  Nor let me love in Vain  In her fair breast let pity Reign  And mercy keep its Throne  Can she destroy a dying Swain  Or see a Wretch undone  On the BOYN ROCK  WHERE ancient  Boyn  his edies run  In rowling streams against the Sun  And do's in curling mazes stray  On liquid murmurs to the Sea  Close by the spot of happy Ground  Where  Nassau  felt a harmless Wound  Who bravely fought through fate his way  Nor damp'd by dangers won the Day  Near that place a Pile appears  Disguis'd with Age and Gray with Years  It's nodding Summit seems to peep  And view it's shadow in the deep  Upon it's brow is always seen  A Haughthorn Bush that's ever green  It's Convex o'er the Current swells  The Concave forms two dreary cells  That are a safe and cool Retreat  From Winter's Storms and Summers heat  Within whose Caverns now and then  Do meet young Lasses and young Men  What there they do I dare but think  It's frightful sure so near the Brink  My friend and I have often sat  Upon it's Brow with chearful Chat  Where with delight we'd sit and spy  The  Salmon  flouncing at a Flie  And when the  Trout  with nimble Leap  Above the wave display'd his Shape  And made the limpid Mirror swell  In curling Rings when down he fell  Thus engag'd the pleasant while  We did our Time and Cares beguile  Then sunk in thought enquir'd the Cause  Of what we saw and Natures Laws  How Vapours drawn from Earth and Sea  By  Phoehus  's warm attractive Ray  Did wrapt in Clouds a while remain  And when condens'd descend in Rain  Then strain'd through Rocks did purer flow  And rose refin'd in Springs below  Which straying from their native source  Unites in streams of rapid force  That blooming Verdure always yields  To paint the Lawns and fertil Fields  'Till lost in wonder ws gave o'er  And learn'd their Author to adore  From thence we saw in order meet  Some Ships on Land a moving Fleet  Born by  Tritons  from the Shore  Who hung a Galley on each Oar  Sons of  Neptune  that can bear  Upon their Backs a Man of War  Those Oval Barks of skins are made  Their Paddl's like a broken Spade  When fix'd within those whirling Dishes  They fill their Nets with shoals of Fishes  Then each by lot receives his due  And homewards lugs his light Canoe  The Angler too with Flies and Hooks  That puddles in the Ponds and Brooks  Expecting still some lucky rise  Who waits the Fortune of his Flies  Him too we saw with Rod and Line  Amusing thought beguiling Time  When Faint and Dry he homewards came  And swore the Wind had spoil'd his Game  Who said he threw and threw again  Exchang'd his Baits but still in vain  But added he to chear my sorrow  I hope to meet good sport tomorrow  You see the River seems to clear  The Wind I hope will quickly veer  Those friendly Clouds that hide the Sun  Will make a chearful dusky Noon  When we shall to the Banks resort  And find an Hour's delightful sport  Fatigues to me are but a Sham  Could all this Road afford a Dram  For shame that none of all the Club  Will at the Tavern sell some Bub  There's not a Brother sure wou'd fail  But each wou'd help to drink his ALE  And every Day there passes many  That for a Dram would drop their Penny  At for me I'm always willing  Once a week to spend my Shilling  But let me see who shall we get  That at the Rock may sell some Wet  Why  Frank  ifaith's the only Man  For he and we are Cup and Can  An honest hearty loving Fellow  Will crack a Crock till he is Mellow  And will besides provide a Dish  A pair of Rabbits or some Fish  Not a Day or Night in twenty  You will find his Castle empty  There's nothing can his humour Curl  And on my soul he is no Churl  Besides he may with ease attend  His Lordship's Work so near at hand  In short there's not a Man alive  That at the Rock would sooner thrive  Now were we in Counsel set  And most of all the Club were met  He said when each with Heart and Voice  Made honest  Frank  the common Choice  My Friend th' invited out of Hand  And soon possess'd him of his Land  The House that long neglected lay  To weep it's Ruin in scraps of Clay  Do's now display it's gaudy Air  And proudly boasts its new Repair  The tatter'd Roof disdains a Flaw  And shows its Fleece of Wheaten Straw  With Walls and Windows plaster'd o'er  And temper'd Clay to pave the Floor  Whilst all within is neat and clean  With Implements in order seen  No more shall  Goblins  there resort  Or  Fairies  keep their midnight Court  Now shall it's Crannys Creeks and Holes  No longer lodge the  Batts  and  Owls  But now it will be ever gay  With WHISKY flowing Night and Day  Within this rural homely Spot  All carking cares are quite forgot  Here mirth and joy shall both abound  And Love and Friendship still go round  Here  Francis  sits at ease and rest  To entertain an honest Guest  A worthy Chap does now begin  And on my faith no pluck'em in  It's here old  Dudly  shews his Scars  And tells of  Flanders  and the Wars  Of  Hocksted  's plain and brave defeat  And how the creeping  French  were beat  And here his troubles to redress  Resorts the Noble Prince of  Hess  Maro  too sedate and wise  Often comes to make his Flies  Maro  with open candid Soul  A mind as Generous as the Bowl  Himself an honest chearful Guest  The life and grace of e'vry Feast  In him two shining gems contend  Which speak the  Scholar  and the  Friend  But see the  Hero  by his side  Who cuff'd the Waves and foaming Tide  Sure friendship fir'd his worthy Heart  That could  Altides  charms desert  Not beauties power could him arrest  He waded dangers to the Waste  His presence glads the chearful throng  And sooth's their care with Pipe and Song  His Musick can a pasage find  To move the Soul and lull the Mind  It's thus the Jocund Chorus join  And quaff in plenty at the BOYN  Boon companions daily flock  To meet a welcome at the Rock  An Elegy on  John Wade  Esq  WITH gastly Smiles each sordid Miser's Shade  Rejoic'd to catch the welcome Ghost of  Wade  With wide expanse their griping Arms unfold  To grasp the  Mammon  like a Bag of  Gold  O impartial Death we now too plainly see  Thy dreadful Dart disdains a Bribe or Fee  Could nothing than thy fatal Arm restrain  Not Heaps of Pelf or Thoussnds on the Plain  Whose wo  y Loads th' Indigent never got  'Till Sheep and Fleece were suffer'd both to rot  His careful tender Heart could ne'er allow  That Colts and Fillies should be train'd to plow  Express'd Compassion to his Stud Mare's Race  But made poor Men supply his Horses Place  His p  mper'd Steeds ne'er felt the useful Yoke  The Breaking Bridle or the Rider's Stroke  But rov'd unbounded thro' the Meads and Wood  And like their Owner liv'd for no ones Good  Whilst he their Age and want of Teeth conceals  And hides their Years beneath their Mains and Tails  His simple Tradesmen with such Goods he paid  And for a Gelding gave some toothless Jade  The weeping Mice may now his Loss regret  When poor Men starv'd they fed on precious Wheat  Such Vermin in his Breast could Pity find  But shut the Door of Mercy to his Kind  The craving Needy from his Gate he warns  While Heaps of Corn lay Rotting in his Barns  His Niggard Soul begrudg'd the Food he Eat  Nine Days he strove to live without his Meat  Sure Avarice in him is solely fled  And Misers are with  Wade  and  Demar  dead  O Fare them well since here they are no more  But snatch'd too late to curse their Idol Store  What now avails their Bags of shining Dust  The useless Heaps that in their Coffers Rust  Those bolted Trunks that held their better Parts  Contain'd their Money and their sordid Hearts  A doleful Dialogue I fear they hold I  And find there is another God than God  EPITAPH  YOU see at last poor  Wade  is dead  Who once had mighty Heaps ef Gold  Nor is he worth ten Pound of Lead  If he were to the Surg'ons sold  But then theres Flear's under Ground  That soon will get a welcome Guest  And would not take two hundred Pounds  To miss a griping Miser's Feast  An Elegy on poor  Robert Moore  the great Disputant  SAgacious  MOORE  alass is gone to know  The Truth of what he Fought for here below  With warm Zeal both Night and Day he strove  His Foes to baffle and his Cause to prove  With endless Feuds his harmless Mind they Vext  And plagu'd his Patience with some  Vulgar  Text  But he Impregnant still their Quirks did Cuff  And shew'd their Arguments were all but Stuff  For twice a Week he enter'd in the Cause  And never left the Field but with Applause  By Dint of Reason and by  Scripture  Force  The only Arms to which he had Recourse  He drove those haughty Sticklers from the Field  And made their Champions to his Prowess yield  No borrow'd Weapons did our HERO bring  Resembling  DAVID  with his Stones and Sling  He came with Joy to meet th' unequal Foe  Their great  Goliah  felt his parting Blow  In him fair Truth with native Lustre shone  And sacred  Scripture  seem'd to be his own  Religion'  Bulwark in his Rank he stood  And never fail'd to make his Purpose good  When three to one he often did Dispute  He could their ablest  Causuists  consute  But who shall now those Enemies engage  Since MOORE too soon has left the hostile Stage  Where he by list'ning Crowds with Joy was seen  To gain Applause in that important Scene  With brave Success he still perform'd his Part  Defended Truth without the Help of Art  He to the  Church  has signal Service done  Who knew no Language but his  Mother Tongue  By that alone her Principles maintain'd  And adverse  Quirks  and  Sophisms  disdain'd  The HOLY BIBLE for his Rule he took  And drew his Reas'nings from that sacred BOOK  From thence with pious Hints he stor'd his Head  And Demonstration follow'd all he said  But Death came creeping in a slow Decay  And Inch by Inch he stole our Friend away  As if by tedious Arguments he'd have  Our worthy Stickler to his lonely Grave  Death came round him with a tardy Scope  As half unwilling to destroy our Hope  But gone he is be it with Sorrow said  Rejoice some Folks for your great FOE is dead  O  Shorthill  now you may with  Gorman  cry  Come on come on we all your Force defie  To combat now we'll meet you without fail  We'll bogg your Arguments and drink your Ale  And  Sheridan  too ten to one will hold  The  Fox  being gone that  Gander  is grown bold  With nois'y Brags they loudly now will Vaunt  And boasting cry we'll all your courage Daunt  We doubt not but each Victory to gain  Your Strength and Pride has left the hostile Plain  So when  Achilles  from the War withdrew  Each stripling  Trojan  dare the Fight renew  Those poor  Poultroons  that durst not see his Face  Will now triumph since Death has chang'd the Case  O  EngineAlley  Paint your blue Posts black  Melt down your Pottles and your Pitchers crack  Let all your Taps in mourning Murmurs run  And flowing Possets purl their Liquid moan  Your Friend indeed who once could bring you Trade  A tedious Exit from your Doors has made  A Friend he was and to your Interest kind  A better Cause has few such Friends behind  EPITAPH  POOR  MOORE  who once could well Dispute  And stand a tedious stiff Debate  Theres only Death could soon confute  Since  ROBIN  was run down by Fate  'Till then no  Sophist  with his Art  Could his discerning Sense deceive  Death's Topicks touch'd him to the Heart  And did convert him to the Grave  To Mr  Stanly  Apothecary  OF all the Trades a Wit is sure the worst  For Poets are by Providence acurst  The shabby Rogues get nothing for their Pains  But empty Pockets and tormented Brains  The great Reward adapted to their Lays  Is Garret Lodgings and a little Praise  True good Fellows now and then may treat'em  But serious Ones of e'vry Sort do hate'em  Will curse their Epigrams and damn their Muse  A better Trade say they to blacken Shoes  As for those Raskals with the scrib'ling Itch  Their donny Charters never to be Rich  Are valu'd like a Monkey for his Tail  And pledg'd by Doctors for a Pot of Ale  An Elegy on Arn We  LET  Quakers  Weep and  Builders  now Rejoice  Since Death at last has made the wish'dfor Choice  At length he did by one unerring Stroke  Thrust  Cr We  into a Chest of Oak  Its all the meagre Tyrant now affords  Altho his Captive lov'd to deal in Boards  Unkind he was his Wooden Trade to hinder  And sink his Credit in a Case of Timber  Blame not me nor think that I'm Scoffing  For on my Faith I only mean his Coffin  Of all the Plank he ever sold or bought  He has no more than makes him now a Coat  The Workman came with Wings of joyful hast  To make that Suit that was to be his last  For rather than so good a Jobb should stand  Every  Chip  I'm sure would lend a Hand  Not one of all the chearful tribe would fail  But each would strive to clinch the foremost Nail  And I'll be bound that e'vry Man whatever  Would take due Care to fasten down the Cover  Within his gloomy Mansion to immure him  From the  World  and  Builders  to secure him  O he's fled but where by Fate he's driven  To  Charon  's Coast or up the Road to Heaven  Is now indeed a Dark mysterious Doubt  There's only  W  can find the Secret out  But of the two I'd boldly lay a Groat  His welcome Shade was wafted in the Boat  What Point that lands at few or none can tell  But some suspect it borders near to H  If on that Coast his Fortune was to fix  He's still a Dealer on the Banks of Styx  And perhaps for his Judgment Skill and Care  May be employ'd by  Pluto  for Surveyor  Ye  Quakers  all lament Friend  We  with Tears  Whose Character as black is You appears  Who murder'd Trade and lop'd off ev'ry Joint  That us'd the Rule and Compass faithful Point  But now he's gone let injur'd Workmen have  One joyful Day to Dance upon his Grave  Whilst I pay Tribute to his hateful Herse  And sing his Actions in vindictive Verse  The EPITAPH  WITHIN this Hole his Body lies  His Soul is fled the Lord knows where  See the glad Croud with joyful Eyes  Whilst each let's fall a chearful Tear  Let ev'ry Foot tread down this Clod  And willing Hands heap on the Clay  Oh bury deep the sordid Sod  And lock it till the Judgment Day  The following Lines are humbly Ad∣dress'd to  Arthur Dobbs  and  John Codding∣ton  Esqrs on the laudable Design to erect an Obelisk at the  Boyn  WHEN high Oppression crush'd the guilty Land'  And bleeding Justice claim'd the HERO's Hand  When pale Religion sunk her mourning Head  And glorious Liberty was almost fled  No saving Arm could  Albion  's Rights maintain  'Till  WILLIAM  's Hand soon broke the servile Chain  His noble Soul  Brittania  's Thrall did see  Redress'd her Wrongs and bid her once be Free  What lofty Trophies should glad  Britons  raise  To  NASSAU  'S Glory and to virtue's Praise  A Soul like His who soar'd to deathless Fame  In Deeds immortal as His sacred NAME  What breathing Statues and expressive Coin  Should speak his Actions and Record the  Boyn  Or Pyramids to shade th'illustr'ous Flood  And tell where once the Royal HERO stood  What stately Columns should adorn the Ground  Where Mighty  WILLIAM  felt harmless Wound  Who bravely fought thro' storming Death His Way  Repel'd the Foe and snatch'd the doubtful Day  Whom Angels shielded in the sanguine Tide  Who turn'd fell Swords and flying Fates aside  Yours it is by publick worth to claim  A Kingdom's Credit and a Patriot's NAME  To latest

Such splended Labours with the Sun shall shine  And set with Nature at the End of Time  All Hail to thee who came to us once more  A welcome Friend unto thy native Shore  Thy curious Mind to foreign
