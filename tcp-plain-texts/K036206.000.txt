the Right Honourable The COUNTESS of  Lincoln  MADAM  I Truly wish this Play were more worthy of your Ladyship's Name Yet I do not presume to offer it to you for its poetical Merit I dedicate to you Madam the Virtues of your Sex Whatever seems to me most amiable and estimable in Woman I have endeavoured to shew in the Characters of  Eugenia  and  Orphisa  In  Orphisa  that Fortitude of Spirit that Dignity of Sentiments that exalted Understanding which in my Ideas form the Woman of Quality and in  Eugenia  that Purity of Heart that Gentleness of Disposition that filial Piety which give to Youth its best its truest Loveliness  Whether I have succeeded your Ladyship in your own Feelings and Experience can best determine If I have let me be bold to expect your Patronage It is for the Interest of that Virtue which you love for it is not sufficient Madam to practise her Precepts in your own private Life you must come forth and do her Honour by a public Appearance in her Favour In her Name I expect your Protection in her Name let me dare to promise my future Life and its best Gratitude shall deserve itI am  MADAM  Your LADYSHIP's Most obedient humble Servant PHILIP FRANCIS  PROLOGUE  Written and spoken by Mr  GARRICK  TO damn or notthat is the Question now  Whether 'tis best to deck the Poet's Brow  With Hands and Hearts unanimous befriend him  Or take up Arms and by opposing end him  But hold before you give the fatal Word  I beg that I as Council may be heard  And what few Council ever yet have done  I'll take no Bribe and yet plead  Pro  and  Con  First for the Town and UsI see some Danger  Should you too kindly treat this reverend Stranger  If such good Folks these Wits of graver Sort  Should here usurp a Right to spoil your Sport  And curb our Stage so wanton bold and free  To the strict Limits of their Purity  Should dare in Theatres reform Abuses  And turn our Actresses to pious Uses  Farewell the joyous Spiritstirring Scene  Farewell thetheyou guess the Thing I mean  If this wise Scheme so sober and so new  Should pass with us would it go down with you  Should we so often see your wellknown Faces  Or would the Ladies send so fast for Places  Now for the AuthorHis poetic Brat  Throughout the Town occasions various Chat  What say the Snarlers'Tis a  French  Translation  That we deny but plead an Imitation  Such as we hope will please a freeborn Nation  His Muse tho' much too grave to dress or dance  For some Materials took a Trip to  France  She owns the Debt nor thinks she shall appear  Like our spruce Youths the worse for going there  Tho' she has dealt before in sportive Song  This is her first StageFlight and t'would be wrong  Nay poaching too to kill your Bards too young  Poets like Foxes make best Sport when old  The Chase is good when both are hard and bold  Do you like other Sportsmen then take heed  If you destroy the Whelps you spoil the Breed  Let him write on acquire some little Fame  Then hunt him Critics he'll be noble Game  ADVERTISEMENT  IT may not be improper to tell an  English  Reader some Circumstances of this Play The Character of  AEMILIA  consequently her Scenes with  MERCOUR  is wholly new The Fable excepting some Alterations which seemed necessary with regard to the Difference of the  French  and  English  Stage is taken from a Comedy published last Year by Madame  Grafigny  Let me be permitted to take this Opportunity of returning my best Thanks to the several Performers for the Chearfulness with which they went through the Fatigue of Rehearsing and Acting The Public is the best Judge of their Merit and its Favour the best Proof of it  Mr  Garrick  is intitled to my sincerest Gratitude for his Performance as an Actor and for his Punctuality as a Manager but his Assistance in a thousand Alterations his strong good Sense with that Spirit of Theatrical Criticism which is his peculiar natural Genius give him a Right to a great Share of that Applause with which this Play was received The rest is Friendship and Esteem  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  Marquis of DELVILLE  Mr  Havard  DORIMOND  Mr  Berry  MERCOUR  Mr  Garrick  CLERVAL  Mr  Dexter  WOMEN  EUGENIA  Miss  Bellamy

then speaks  AEMILIA  AH what a Look was there How his Eye started  As from a Thing of Horrour I am lost  Abandon'd to an unavailing Penitence  To the Upbraidings of my own weak Heart  Looking after him  To Virtue's keen Reproaches MERCOUR MERCOUR  For all the promis'd Joys of Love and Constancy  Oh teach me not to feel what now I am  Or to forget what late I was how bless'd  With InnocenceAlas now lost for ever  MERCOUR speaking as he exters  It was the Musick of AEMILIA's Voice  Tho' much untun'd from its delightful Sounds  When harmonis'd by Love Tell me my Heart  Why did AEMILIA call me  AEMILIA  Did I call you  MERCOUR  Repeatedly with Accent most alarming  AEMILIA  It was the Voice of Sorrow and Despair  Not mine  MERCOUR  Despair But how can it approach you  By Friendship guarded in the Arms of Love  Yet whence those Startings of the Soul that rend  The labouring Breast Why melts your Eye upon me  Whence is that Paleness on my Fairone's Cheek  Where rosy Love with Pleasure's Blushes glowing  Was wont to dwell amidst the Smiles of Beauty  AEMILIA  And sureforbid it Loveyou're alter'd too  Are you the same as constant to our Friendship  MERCOUR  As you are beautiful Why doubts AEMILIA  Her wondr'ous Power of charming  AEMILIA  Yet even now  Your Eye meets mine with Pain Some secret Purpose  Turns it aside and that once dear Protesting  Which Love was wont to warm

little kind Sincerity  MERCOUR  AEMILIA  Can she suspect the Heart that she has form'd  Where fits her Image in the Power of Beauty  To rule its Passions and inspire its Wishes  AEMILIA  Tell me my Fate nor fear that I'll upbraid you  Nor shall my Rage nor shall my Tears upbraid you  Nor even my Love I'll find a thousand Reasons  To justify your Change I'll tell my Heart  'Midst its resenting Beatings that your Passions  Are not your own that Love's inconstant Pleasures  Are sacred to your lordly Sex that Men  However just to Honour with each other  Should scorn their fond Engagements with a Woman  MERCOUR  I would be just to both For some Days past  I own my Thoughts have been perplex'd confus'd  A thousand varying Projects for your Happiness  AEMILIA  My Happiness  MERCOUR  Oh my Soul's highest Pride  Does it become the Dignity of Love  To steal into your Arms to hide our Joys  In Darkness and Concealment I'll no longer  Bear these uncertain casual Hours of Bliss  But let the World behold and envy me  The rich Possession of AEMILIA's Beauties  I'll make you mine for ever  AEMILIA  Your's for ever  Oh let my Heart pour forth its Joy in Thanks  Forgive th' unkind Suspicions the Reproaches  MERCOUR  They were Suspicions that arose from Love  But will you hear  AEMILIA  My Soul is listening to you  MERCOUR  My Father to support his Country's Honour  And his own noble Birth in foreign Embassies  Consum'd a fair Estate and left his Sons  My Brother and myself dependant vilely  Upon my Uncle's Bounty  AEMILIA  Oh how nobly  Has he discharg'd the sacred Trust of Friendship  And Duty of a Parent  MERCOUR  True his Duty  Then how are we oblig'd Curse on the Name  Of Obligation How my Soul disdains  This Insolence of Goodness that enslaves  The freeborn Mind Is not his every Act  An Insult on our Wants Has he not gain'd  From our Distress the Name he most delights in  The Name of Good Methinks a rich Return  For trivial Benefits without the Slavery  Of endless Gratitude  AEMILIA  Surely you mean  T'insult my Understanding As for me  He took me in Distress of Infancy  The Orphan of his Friend With every Tenderness  Even of a Parent's Care he form'd my Youth  Alas in vain to Sentiments of Virtue  Here were no Ties of Blood no Sense of Duty  'Twas innate Goodness and my grateful Soul  Through all its Feelings thanks him But forgive me  I interrupted you  MERCOUR  The fair EUGENIA  His much lov'd Daughter  AEMILIA aside  Ah what means my Heart  By its tumultuous Beating  MERCOUR  Vain and haughty  Bred in the virtuous Principles of Pride  By her affected Governess  AEMILIA  ORPHISA  MERCOUR  Ay she who even in Poverty assumes  An Insolence that treats me with Disdain  And has refus'd a Bribe which might have purchas'd  A wealthier Honesty  AEMILIA  A Bribe For what  MERCOUR  I would have gain'd her to befriend my Purpose  On her fair Pupil 'midst the solemn Lessons  With which forsooth she forms her Heart to Wisdom  To steal a kindly Mention of my Love  Into her Breast and mix me with its Passions  AEMILIA  Wildness and Horrour Passions Love EUGENIA  Yet yet be kind and ease my tortur'd Heart  MERCOUR  This Morn I mean to ask her of her Father  And if he easy Man should grant her to me  With that unmeasurable Wealth his Age  Hath long amass'd when a few Days are spent  In the cold Duties of the nuptial Bed  We'll fly AEMILIA to some distant Realm  Enjoy each other be a present Wonder  And leave to future Times a bright Example  Of Constancy in Love  AEMILIA  A breathless Horrour  Heaves panting at my Heart Outcasts of Virtue  What Nation will receive us Whither fly  Wheree'er the Sun drives round the various Day  'Tis the same Sun that here beheld our Guilt  In vain the Midnight Cloud shall fall upon us  Nor shall the Grave's eternal Darkness hide it  'Twill rise to future Worlds Oh could we fly  Far from all human Converse from ourselves  From Conscience and from Memory  MERCOUR  AEMILIA  I have no Time to waste in idle Arguments  On visionary Subjects Let me rather  Demand your Aid th' Assistance of your Friendship  With this fond Girl It is your Interest Fairone  And Interest our best Wisdom should instruct you  To try your Sex's Arts to win her for me  You know their softest Moments  AEMILIA  Yes 'tis just  Most exquisitely just this purpos'd Insult  And mark it ye unhappy Ones like me  Thus shall it ever prove who first betrays  Will first insult our Weakness Hear me Sir  Fall'n as I am from Honour lost to Fame  And hateful to myself yet dare not think  I basely can betray another's Innocence  Be wise and dread the Wildness of my Temper  Lest it start out in Madness to destroy  Myself and Thee with Horrours worthy both  Exit  MERCOUR  There goes the Sex's Virtue and their Spirit  But that I know her Pride her Sense of Shame  These too are female Virtues I might fear  The Wildness of her Threats But soft my Uncle  Now for a soothing Tale of Love and Rapture  For my fair Cousin

within me  As conscious of some happier Hours approaching  MERCOUR  'Tis Heaven in Bounty to the Good and Virtuous  That gives this Foretaste of approaching Happiness  And dashes the presumptuous Villain's Hopes  With visionary Boadings  DORIMOND turning a little from MERCOUR  Truly said  How nobly just are all his Sentiments  MERCOUR  No wonder Sir I learn'd them all from you  Your Converse and Example  DORIMOND  Stop we here  The rest were Flatt'ry Let us change the Subject  When you and my fair Ward AEMILIA meet  I have observ'd nor think me grown too curious  Your Eyes maintain a gentle Correspondence  Of many a tender Meaning  MERCOUR aside  Then I'm ruin'd  DORIMOND  Her Father was my Friend brave wise and honest  You were his Favourite he much esteem'd you  And made me first observe that open Nature  For which I since have lov'd you  I know he gladly would have seen his Daughter  The happy wedded Partner of your Merit  MERCOUR aside  This Stroke has Thunder in it  DORIMOND  Therefore think  If a full Third of all that I possess  Can make you happy  MERCOUR  Sir enjoy it long  DORIMOND  I shall enjoy it if I make you happy  MERCOUR  Nor me alone I long have known your Bounty  My very Being your's let it extend  In doing Acts of Charity Compassion  And universal Love Open the Gates  Of Liberty to Wretches lost in Dungeons  Relieve th' Opprest assert the Orphan's Rights  And teach the Widow's Heart to sing for Joy  With Bounty guide the partial Hand of Fortune  And make the Virtuous happy  DORIMOND  Nor shall these  The Duties of our Being be neglected  But let me ask your Heart how it approves  Of my Proposal  MERCOUR  Sir my Will is yours  And my Obedience  DORIMOND  No speak freely to me  MERCOUR  Sir if I must obey youLet me own  AEMILIA has her Charms my Eye confesses them  But not the Charm of Looks the frail Delight  Of Beauty can subdue a Heart like mine  Superior Sense the Beauties of the Soul  That Dignity of Sex which can chastise  The Wishes it inspires tho' pure as Innocence  Such are EUGENIA's Charms  DORIMOND  EUGENIA's  MERCOUR  Sir  DORIMOND  You stand amaz'd What can this Transport mean  MERCOUR  Oh give me back the dear the fatal Name  That my Distraction utter'd Wild it started  From the quick Pantings of my Heart  DORIMOND  Surprizing  In one of your cool Temper Knows EUGENIA  Your Passion for her  MERCOUR  Sir you hold me honest  Nor would I lose my own my SelfEsteem  Or bear the Woundings of a secret Baseness  Even for EUGENIA's Beauties Then imagine  Whether I could presume without your Leave  To talk to her of Love  DORIMOND  Still truly just  I own I meant to give her to your Brother  His Gayety of Youth I thought might charm  The fancy of a Girl but as ye both  Divide my Heart and share my best Esteem  It is to me indifferent who gains her  I will propose you to her and shall plead  Your elder Claim of Birthright as of Love  MERCOUR  May Love's own Eloquence inspire your Tongue  Paint the pure Passion of my Love refin'd  From sordid Interests as from sensual Meanings  And with a Parent's soft Authority  Oh win her to Obedience  DORIMOND  No I dare not  I must disclaim all other Influence  Than that of tender and persuasive Reason  MERCOUR  Let me disclaim it too Ungenerous thought  In which my honest Heart had no Concernment  DORIMOND going  I do believe it  MYRCOUR aside  Yes in Truth you may  Th' unlucky Thought escap'd me  DORIMOND returning  But AEMILIA  My second CareI think your Brother's Heart  Is not insensible and she has Beauty  My Age rejoices in the Hope This Moment  YesI'll propose her to him for their Union  And yours with my EUGENIA are alone  My earnest Prayer to Heaven  Exit  MERCOUR  What easy Creatures  Are these same honest Men so

 Whom highly I esteem  MERCOUR  Perhaps the Person  Whom now you parted with  CLERVAL  The same His Story  Which yet I'm not at Liberty to tell you  Is full of Wonders mix'd with such Misfortunes  MERCOUR  Has he been long at Paris  CLERVAL  He arriv'd  But lately from our Settlements in India  Last Night I brought him with me from the Army  Where though conceal'd beneath that mean Disguise  Yet his great Spirit through the Ranks of War  Diffus'd a Soldier's WarmthThe Warmth of Glory  MERCOUR  May I not know him I perhaps can serve him  Why may not I be trusted with this Secret  CLERVAL  It is the Secret of my Friend not mine  MERCOUR  I'm satisfied It is most noble in you  To succour the Distress'd Yet your own Happiness  Might well employ a youthful Lover's Cares  So near his nuptial Day  CLERVAL  My nuptial Day  MERCOUR  You seem surpriz'd Has not my Uncle told you  He means to give you his beloved Daughter  The fair  CLERVAL  EUGENIA  MERCOUR  No the fair AEMILIA  In every real Tenderness of Heart  As much his Daughter as the young EUGENIA  CLERVAL  O my deluded Soul How swift was Hope  To catch th' imaginary Joy Oh Brother  MERCOUR  Now for a Strain of Rature

and Envy  For whom design'd  MERCOUR  Is she indeed this Wonder  CLERVAL  Sure she was form'd in some indulgent Hour  Which bless'd the Works of Nature with Perfection  That Truth and Honour might with Beauty dwell  And Virtue with the chaste Delights of Love  MERCOUR  Such are the Dreams of Lovers As for me  Who think perchance with less mysterious Reverence  As with less Rapture of a Woman's Worth  I take her  CLERVAL  Brother  MERCOUR  For some wiser Reasons  Some truer Merit To deal frankly with you  The Father's Fortune is the Daughter's Beauty  CLERVAL  Be wiser still Enjoy my Uncle's Fortune  Let me possessOh give her to my Arms  Rich in herself in her own native Wealth  Of Youth and Beauty give the charming Maid  And make your Brother happy  MERCOUR  CLERVAL hold  These Transports if I thought EUGENIA knew them  Much more encourag'd themWe yet are Brothers  But learn to think less warmly of the Woman  Whom you perhaps tomorrow may call Sister  Exit  CLERVAL  Tomorrow and my Sister What no more  Only a Day and such a Day of Horrour  Between my Fate and me  Enter DELVILLE  CLERVAL  Come now my Lord  And after fifteen Years of Banishment  While every Clime had its peculiar Sorrows  Behold a new Distress  DELVILLE  Sure I have seen  Affliction's various Forms Is there a Grief  That saddens human Life I have not known  CLERVAL  EUGENIA  DELVILLE starting  Ha that Start has Meaning in it  Then you have heard you knowLet me conjure you  Give me each Circumstance  DELVILLE  By holy Friendship  My Wonder was to hear that Name pronounc'd  In Accents of Despair  CLERVAL  Oh it was once  'Twas Music tun'd by Love 'Tis lost for ever  My Brother's Wife my Sister these are Names  My Tongue must learn EUGENIA's is no more  Pass but a few short HoursI dare not think on't  My Sister's Lover Misery and Horrour  DELVILLE  Fly to your Uncle pour your Heart before him  The Heart has a peculiar Eloquence  To plead the Cause of Love  CLERVAL  Has not my Brother  The Aids of Art to paint th' unconscious Passion  EUGENIA's Virtues tho' he feel them not  Her Beauties though he gaz'd insensible  Are ample Themes for counterfeited Rapture  But whymy Lord your Day of Happiness  Tho' long o'ercast again is opening on you  Why should I cloud it o'er  DELVILLE  And can you think  That I'll enjoy the Blessings you restore me  My Sovereign's Pardon Honours Friends and Fame  Till you are happy Nor despair my CLERVAL  For if without Presumption to high Heaven  The Virtuous must be happy  CLERVAL  Whence my Lord  Are your Misfortunes then  DELVILLE  From Guilt and Justice  Did I not break the Laws of Earth and Heaven  When for a Point of Honour false false Honour  I kill'd the Partner of my Soul my Friend  I lov'd him I esteem'd himand I kill'd him  CLERVAL  The King the Judge of Honour as of Justice  Declares you innocent  DELVILLE  But in that Court  Where Conscience Heavn's Vicegerent sits supreme  Who shall acquit me there  CLERVAL  You think too deeply  DELVILLE  The King is gracious but in vain his Mercy  Till I can find that dear that bosom'd Bliss  For whom alone I live Driven from her Arms  To hopeless Banishment from the pure Joys  That bless the nuptial Bed  CLERVAL  And yet my Lord  Until your Pardon pass the usual Forms  For you have powerful Enemies this Habit  For a few Hours no more must still conceal you  DELVILLE  I will repress these Longings of the Heart  And wait my CLERVALthink with what Impatience  For News of your EUGENIA  CLERVAL  My EVGENIA  O Sounds how charming to the Hopes of Love  Come Love and Virtue come unite your Powers  Inspire my Heart with Honour how to gain her  Or teach itOhwithout a Crime to lose her  ACT II  DORIMOND and EUGENIA meeting  DORIMOND  MY Morning's Joy may all its dearest Blessings  As fall its Dews on Earth descend upon you  Sure my EUGENIA rising with the Morn  Steals her Complexion from her Why those Blushes  A Father's Praise is but th' Excess of Fondness  The Overflowing of a Heart that loves you  EUGENIA  And can I wish it more This tender Proof  That your EUGENIA's not displeasing to you  Is far beyond all Praise  DORIMOND  My Life's first Blessing  But yet its tender Care and soft Anxiety  For while my Heart with pleasurable Fondness  Pours its Affections o'er you still it trembles  With strongly imag'd Fears  EUGENIA  Alas my Father  DORIMOND  If Heaven's Indulgence should no longer spare me  To this delightful Task to form your Youth  But I'll not pain thy gentle Disposition  I came to talk to you of Happiness  Thou Fondness of my Soul  EUGENIA aside  Where will this end  DORIMOND  Tell me EUGENIA can a Virgin's Heart  Conceive the chaste Delights the pure Endearments  That dwell with wedded Love where holy Friendship  Inspires the mutual Wish where equal Interests  Produce an equal Bliss where each is happy  In th' other's Happiness  EUGENIA  Sir may I own  If the Acquaintance of a Man of Worth  Be truly valuable how much more dear  Must his Alliance be his kindred Virtues  To have my Understanding form'd improv'd  Enlarg'd by his superior Sense to share  In the Esteem that's paid him by his Friends  Or by the public Voice that speaks his Worth  If there were such a Man  DORIMOND  There is there is  Whom his own Sex esteems for manly Virtue  And yours might love for every softer Art  Which makes that Virtue amiable  But as the highest Proof how dear I hold him  For Nature bids me love him as my Kinsman  I dare to trust him with EUGENIA's Happiness  EUGENIA aside  It isbe still my HeartIt must be CLERVAL  To DORIMOND  What has my Soul but Gratitude and Love  What has my Duty Sir but its Obedience  To pay you back this wondrous Tenderness  DORIMOND  Then take him from my Hand my Heart my Judgment  My happy Nephew MERCOUR Ha that trembling  That pale Confusion on your frighted Cheek  What can it mean Whence are those Tears EUGENIA  EUGENIA  They are not mine they start involuntary  From Passions not my own But Sir my Will  My Duty Love and Gratitude are mine  And they shall all obey you  DORIMOND  No my Child  I am a Father would be thought a Friend  Whom Nature has entrusted with your Happiness  Whose more experienc'd Age might influence  But not controul your Choice Yet this hereafter  For now my Heart's too fullof Tenderness  Going  EUGENIA  Yet stay Oh stay I'll stop these gushing Tears  Since they displease you Do not leave me thus  This the first Time think how my Heart must feel it  I ever knew your Anger your Displeasure  DORIMOND embracing her  Is this to be displeas'd Is this like Anger  Indulgent Nature hovers o'er her Works  As they yet rise to Life with less fond Pleasure  Than fills thy Father's Breast nor will I ask  Why you are thus alarm'dSome other Time  Enter ORPHISA  ORPHISA take my Daughter to your Care  Exit DORIMOND  EUGENIA ORPHISA  ORPHISA  Your Father strangely mov'd and you in Tears  Could you offend him or can he be angry  EUGENIA  Tho' always most indulgent yet this Morning  Sure never was a Father's Fondness shewn  In such exceeding Tenderness  ORPHISA  Then what  Afflicts you thus  EUGENIA  His Tenderness ORPHISA  Afflicting as his Anger Yet even now  He thinks me disobedient base ungrateful  Looking after DORIMOND  Oh Sirthese Tearsthis Sorrow of my Soul  Is this like Disobedience This Ingratitude  Turning to ORPHISA  You Madam who have form'd my Heart must know it  Am I ungrateful Can Ingratitude  The basest Vice that taints the human Heart  Dwell with the Lessons you have planted there  ORPHISA  Yet may I understand you  EUGENIA  Pray forgive me  While he pronounc'd his MorningBlessings o'er me  His Looks were full of Care and soft Anxiety  He talk'd to me of Happiness of Marriage  And earnest wish'd to see my Fate united  With one whom be describ'd with every Art  With every Charm that gains Esteem and Love  ORPHISA aside  Sure I once knew the dear Original  Of this delightful PicturePray go on  EUGENIA  With conscious Eye where Joy and Rapture shone  I view'd the pleasing Portrait I compar'd it  With that which Love had pictur'd on my Heart  And found the Likeness real Think ORPHISA  What Horrors fill'd my Eye my Heart my Brain  When with a much unusual Warmth he cry'd  "Then take him from my Hand my Heart my Judgment  My happy NephewMERCOUR"  ORPHISA aside  Poor EUGENIA  Perceiv'd he your Confusion  EUGENIA  It was not in the Power of Artifice  Sure not in my Simplicity to hide  Or to disguise it While my Tongue stopp'd faultering  Unknowing how to answer every Feature  Too strongly told th' Aversion of my Soul  ORPHISA  Whence this Aversion In the World's Opinion  Which seldom judges wrong when it commends  MERCOUR has Merit an extensive Knowledge  In Letters and in Men with every Elegance  That's form'd and polish'd by the Arts of Courts  May I not fear that MERCOUR's greatest Fault  Is CLERVAL's being amiable  EUGENIA  No Madam  It is not that my Judgment disesteems him  There's somewhat in him that my Nature starts at  An Instinct of Aversion  ORPHISA  But his Brother  I will allow his WorthYet all Engagements  EUGENIA  That never shall transgress the Bounds of Duty  Not even in ThoughtWill you condemn them Madam  ORPHISA  I do I must without your Father's Knowledge  The Maid who loves her Innocence should blush  If e'er her wandering Eye excite the Hope  Of secret Love 'tis ev'n a Crime to please  Which Virtue startles at Oh would EUGENIA  Exert the Spirit of Virtue let the Sense  Of filial Piety inspire her Breast  And at the MarriageAltar offer up  The Passions of the Heart that noblest Sacrifice  Worthy of her of Virtue and of Heaven  EUGENIA  And will high Heaven be mock'd with such a Sacrifice  And shall I give my Hand that sacred Pledge  Of Love and Truth to him my Soul abhors  Shall I deceive even him Shall I profane  The Altar and its Rites with Vows of Falshood  There shall I learn Dissimulation there  First speak a Language foreign to my Heart  Ye blessed Saints and Angels shall ye hear  My unhallow'd Lips pronounce the solemn Promise  Of everlasting Love to one I hate  ORPHISA  All holy Things forbid I durst not think it  Yet when th' Affections hear the Voice of Reason  They rise like purest Incense from the Heart  Then who shall rob the Father of his Right  His Child's Obedience Not his Voice alone  'Tis Nature's primal Law that bids obey  And Heaven has promis'd to this first of Duties  Its first of Blessings  EUGENIA  But to live ORPHISA  A mean Dissembler of the Heart's Affections  While Duty coldly acts the part of Love  Guide of my Youth Directress of my Life  Teach me for sure you know th' unerring Path  That leads to Happiness  ORPHISA  There is but one  Not hard to find th' unerring Path of Virtue  Virtue that in itself commands its Happiness  Of every outward Object independant  I see you're mov'd At some more temperate Hour  We may resume the Subject Only this  Let not Aversion Prejudice or Passion  And above all let us not suffer CLERVAL  Smiling  To mix a Lover's Reasoning with our Councils  You must not see him  EUGENIA  How can I avoid him  Look where he comes  ORPHISA  Retire Depend upon me  I'll take a tender Care of all your Interests  EUGENIA looking back as she goes out  O CLERVAL CLERVAL  Enter CLERVAL  ORPHISA as CLERVAL enters  How her Eyes spoke a streaming Tenderness  Beyond all Power of Language  CLERVAL  Stay EUGENIA  Tell me my Fate whate'er you purpose for me  CruelO speak to meunkind EUGENIA  ORPHISA  Sir she has order'd me  CLERVAL  There needs not Madam  A Tale of cruel Pity to inform me  I see it plainthat I am most undone  Your Influence Madam your too rigid Virtue  ORPHISA  You cannot Sir imagine me your Enemy  CLERVAL  I know you cannot be an Enemy  But can you be the Lover's Friend who think  That Love is Weakness She whose Virtue sits  Above the Passions how can she forgive  Their least Misrule in others Can she pity  Those softer Yieldings which she ne'er experienc'd  ORPHISA  I would not Sir be thought insensible  Even to the softest Yieldings of the Heart  For I have known them all  Aside  CLERVAL  Then tell EUGENIA  Let me conjure you tell her that my Heart  Ne'er felt the Power of Beauty for another  Nor Hopes nor Fears nor Wishes that my Eye  Ne'er gaz'd with Joy on any other Form  Witness ye Powers who view our inmost Thoughts  And see the Mind yet rising into Action  Did I e'er think of Happiness without her  Or feel a Grief but as it gave her Pain  ORPHISA  Is there not too much Warmth too much of Passion  In this Protesting When that Youth and Beauty  Whose very Nature is Decay and Frailty  Which now inspire these Transports shall decay  Will they not alter too Will they not change  CLERVAL  Yes Madam when Discretion Sense and Honour  These are EUGENIA's Beauties change their Nature  Then shall my Passion change If it be Passion  'Tis form'd of purer Fire than that which warms  Our Sense to Beauty  ORPHISA  Sir I must confess  These Sentiments most noble I acknowledge  When Virtue rules the Passions they are virtuous  But how can I oblige you Is it fitting  Shall I the Guardian of EUGENIA's Youth  I who should aid her to controul her Heart  Fill her soft Soul with Love's tumultuous Cares  With Love that in itself is all the Passions  CLERVAL  I am perhaps but an improper Judge  Of this calm temperate Reasoning But my Uncle  No Motive there of Duty can restrain you  I know how highly he esteems your Merit  Let me conjure you then  ORPHISA  I must not hear you  My Duty Sir forbids me lest my Heart  It must not yield even to its own Esteem  Aside seeing MERCOUR  Nor shall it MERCOUR to my just Resentment  Even for that bold unworthy Bribe you offer'd me  Enter DORIMOND MERCOUR  MERCOUR  Aside to DORIMOND  Good Heaven forbid that I should do her wrong  By my Suspicions  DORIMOND  I much fear you do not  I have myself observ'dBut I'll be satisfied  MERCOUR  There is a foolish Softness in my Nature  That

Merit were no more  Than just to writeas none e'er wrote before  Why here's a Play nowof what Kind to call it  I know no more thanof what will befal it  Whether the  Critics  Praiseor bolder  Bucks  shall maul it  In  France  'twas Comedy but here 'tis Tragic  And all by dint of pure poetic Magic  Mistake me not I don't by this aver  That  ev'ry  Poet is a Conjurer  Ours is all Sentiment blank Verse and Virtue  DistressBut yet no Bloodshed to divert ye  Such Plays in  France  perhaps may cut a Figure  But to our Critics here they're mere  Soupmeagre  Tho' there they never stain their Stage with Blood  Yet  English  Stomachs love substantial Food  Give us the Lightning's Blaze the Thunder's Roll  The pointed Dagger and the pois'ning Bowl  Let Drums and Trumpets Clangor swell the Scene  Till the gor'd Battle bleed in ev'ry Vein  We love the Muses animating Spark  Till Gods meet Gods and justle in the Dark  This now did something in the Days of Yore  When Lungs heroic made the Galleries roar  As for our Bard the fatal Die is thrown  And now the Question isWhat says the Town  Has he thrown in or is the Dupe undone  Yet on your Justice boldly he relied  No Party form'd no
