house  Lysander  and  Fabio  dressed like a tinker comes forward and  Lysander  waits at a distance  AIR  Fabio  I AM a tinker by my trade  Each day I live I mend  I'm such an universal friend  I hide the faults by others made  Work for the tinker ho good wives  'Twere well while I your kettles mend  If you'd amend your lives  The best that's going is my trade  'Tis even better than the law  By them are breaches wider made  I daily stop up many a flaw  That we shou'd mend is each man's cry  A doctrine 'tis that all will teach  Then how much better pray am I  Who practise what they only preach  Enter  Juletta  Jul  Oh Fabio I was glad to hear the sound of your sweet voiceHa ha ha what a figure you cut  Fab  Oh what you are looking at my appearance 'tis whimsical enough to be sure for a man of my consequence Who would think now that I was valet companion and confidant to Lysander the most hopeful and wealthy heir in all Seville and lover servant and most humble slave to the accomplish'd Juletta gentlewoman duenna and adviser of Donna Marcella the ward of Don Pedro de Castro  Jul  She is only his ward at present to be sure but if your master does not make great haste they will be man and wife within these two hours  Fab  The devil this is a sudden start is it not  Jul  Here comes your master  Enter  Lysander  Fab  Did you hear Sir the pretty news that Mrs Juletta has brought your mistress is going to marry her old dragon of a guardian  Lys  'Tis impossibleShe could not consent to such a thing  Jul  Why it cost her a great many tears to be sure but at last Sir I seconded his request and then she complied  Fab  How you Mrs Minx  Jul  Yes I Mr Impudence  Fab  Why you ungrateful mischievousI don't know what to call youhave you a topknot a ruff or a ruffle that you don't owe to my master's generosity Has there a letter or a message pass'd through your means to Donna Marcella that has not cost him some newfangled gewgaw or other for you beside my usual perquisite  Jul  Very well Sirgo on  Fab  Nay because his happiness was dearer to me than my own have not I to forward the business condescended to cast the eyes of affection upon you  Jul  Intolerable assurance'tis I Jackanapes 'tis I that am abusedDid not I see a poor unfortunate couple moping in distress Did not I for the consideration of a few trifling presents suffer myself to be prevailed upon to extricate them from it  Fab  Very well Ma'amgo on  Jul  And did not I because I wou'd not see you expire before my face take pity on you and give you my virgin heart while thousands vainly tried to tear me from you And what is my reward for all this Why truly when I have persuaded my mistress seemingly to consent to  marry her guardian in order to get her fortune into her own possession that she may the easier run away with the man she loves  Fab  Hey how's this  Lys  Seemingly did you say Juletta  Jul    Crying    Yes I did but I don't understand being illused when I am trying to serve people all I can I am sure I never was thought mercenary before and any body in the world would be vex'd at being abused and scandalized by a brute of a fellow who only presumes so because I have been too kind to him  Fab  Oh zounds now her clack's set agoing stop it who canWell well don't cryI forgive you child  Jul  Forgive me varlet I can tell you I shan't easily forgive you  Fab  Well well but for my master's sake  Lys  Aye Juletta for my sake    Giving her a purse  Jul  I do assure you 'tis entirely for your sake then    looking at the purse    if I am reconciled Brute of a fellowHere Sir is a letter for you and if Confidence here cou'd find a way of getting into the house to bring an answer I shou'd be glad because I am so watch'd  AIR  And for you Sir  Tell me true Sir  Are you not a graceless wretch  For this abuse now  What excuse now  Can you trump upwhat new fetch  Come protest now  'Twas all jest now  Let me see some signs of grace  Hownay then Sir  Ne'er again Sir  Dare to look me in the face    Exit  Lys  Well my Protens this letter has given me spirits She says she'll be in readiness at a minute's warning to take the wing if I can but open the door of her cage  Fab  Suppose Sir I was to try if I cou'd get old Crusty out of the house  Lys  I don't think it practicable  Fab  Faith Sir I have hopes I know that he expects news of the arrival of one of his ships  Lis  Well and what then  Fab  Nothing Sir only I shall make my next appearance in the character of a sailor that's all  Lis  And must I be disguised good Sir for you know I march under your command  Fab  Old Grumble here has never seen you has he  Lys  I believe not  Fab  Then there will be no necessity for it yet but here comes my wife fellowservant Perez let him stay about the house Sir while you go with me to receive further instructions I shall soon return equip'd for my enterprize    Exit  Lys  I'll follow you  Enter  Perez  So Perez how go on affairs  Per  Lord Sir I have emptied all the shops in town I have got such a cartload of vizors veils jackets hats feathers doublets and mustachios why Sir we have disguises enough to stock a Venetian carnival  Lys  Well that's all right Do you watch about Don Pedro's house and I charge you let nothink escape your notice till I return  Per  I warrant you Sir  Lys  Ah dear Marcella let but fortune be propitious to us and my future life shall he devoted to gratitude and thee  AIR  I  All dear Marcella maid divine  No more will I at fate repine  If I this day behold thee mine  For dearly do I love thee  Thy ease shall be my sweet employ  My constant care my every joy  May then no chance my hopes destroy  For dearly do I love thee  II  Sweet is the woodbine to the bee  The rising sun to every tree  But sweeter far art thou to me  For dearly do I love thee  And let me but behold thee mine  No more will I at fate repine  But while I live thou maid divine  With rapture will I love thee    Exit  Enter Don  Pedro  Perez  for sometime does not regard him    Don  P  Truly I doubt of every thing there's such a confounded running in and out Juletta is so impertinent and Marcella so haughty that I am afraid this consenting to marry me was only a pretence to get her fortune out of my hands Well a very short time will now put the matter out of dispute and in the mean while I'll be my own porter and let every body in and out Hey who have we hear  Per  How that man eyes me  Don  P  He looks mighty suspicious methinks  Per  He does not know me sure  Don  P  What can he be doing so near my house  Per  Why he is not watching sure to see who goes in and out is he  Don  P  I'll speak to him  Per  He comes this way  Don  P  If he is one of their spies I must go cunningly to work  Per  Let him be who he will he shan't get any thing out of me  Don  P  Your servant friend  Per  Yours friend  Don  P  What makes you watching about this house so eh  Per  Hush  Don  P  What d'ye mean  Per  Hold your tongue I tell you  Don  P  Why must I hold my tongue  Per  You must not tell a living soul that you saw me watching about this house  Don  P  Oh I must not  Per  Not for the world if it should come to Don Pedro's knowledge laud a mercy what a work would there be  Don  P  Oh ho I guess how the matter is what you are standing centinel to watch their motions within  Per  Why how the devil shou'd you know that  Don  P  Ah you see I'm in all your secrets I know too that you want to get an answer to the letter that you deliver'd two days ago to Juletta for her mistress  Per  No there you are out'twas yesterday morning I deliver'd the letter and she herself brought my master an answer not an hour ago  Don  P  So so why then Don Pedro is finely imposed upon  Per  Imposed upon why what is such an old fool good for but to be imposed upon I can tell you he must look sharp or we shall run away with this delicate morsel from him as sure as he thinks himself of itYou don't know him do you  Don  P  Never saw him in my life  Per  I wish you did for I'm sure you'd laugh at him every time you set eyes on himWell I'll stay hereabout and don't you now drop a word of what I have told you  Don  P  Me No I enjoy it I assure you  Per  I dare say you do every body must easily suppose how agreeable it is to trick such an old coveteous curmudgeon  Don  P  Oh you may depend upon it not a word shall escape me  Per  That's right we can't be too cautious you understand me  Don  P  Oh perfectlyconfound you  Per  These are not matters to blab to every bodyyou apprehend me  Don  P  Clearlyan Alguzile apprehend you  Per  Well now keep my counsel and when we meet again I'll tell you how my master has sped  Don  P  The devil speed him  Per  Mum now    Exit  Don  P  I warrant you  AIR  Some men I know  On this would go  And to the marter put an end  But hold you there  Let's argue fair  The point a little my good friend  'Tis this girl's pelf  And not herself  About which I make so much stir  Give me but that  I answer flat  Who will for Pedro may take her  Exit  SCENE  a room in Don  Pedro  's house  Marcella Juletta  discovered  AIR  I  A choir of bright beauties in spring did appear  To chuse a Maylady to govern the year  All the nymphs were in red and the shepherds in green  The garland was given and Phillis was queen  But Phillis refus'd it and sighing did say  I'll not wear the wreath for my shepherd's away  II  So I confin'd here with no view of relief  No companion but Hope which still mocks at my grief  Each step meeting anguish suspicion and care  And driven alas to the brink of despair  And worse than all these from Lysander away  Ah tell me Juletta how can I look gay  Jul  Ah Madam hang melancholy an ounce of contrivance is worth a cartload of it for the first may keep us moaping here 'till we break our hearts and the latter will point out to us a way to break our prison  Mar  Wou'd it were once effected for I have a thousand terrible apprehensions You may depend on't my guardian won't let me out of his sight if he can help it And at last when we have form'd a scheme if it should miscarry we should be all undone  Jul  So we should indeed Ma'am and if the house was to tumble ten to one but some of us would be hurt Lord Ma'am have a little more spiritIs not it your duty to cheat Don Pedro all you can Is not he old jealous and covetous Does not he want to make you the most miserable creature in the world  Enter Don  Pedro  As sure as I live Ma'am there he is I say Ma'am is not it your duty to oblige Don Pedro all you can Is not he kind careful and tender And does not he want to make you the happiest woman in the world  Don  P  Here's a baggage for you I should be very much obliged to you Ma'am if you would do me the favour to get down stairs  Jul  What's the matter I wonder    Exit  Don  P  Well I have sent away the lawyers but methinks since the deeds were executed you don't shew so much willingness as you did before  Mar  'Tis because you are so unwilling to confide in me I am not allow'd to take any manner of liberty and at the very time I yield myself entirely to you such is your suspicious temper that I am obliged to keep a guard upon all my words and actions  Don  P  My dear Marcella 'tis because my love is so very delicate I take offence at even a smile or a glance that any person forces from you and the care you see me take is for nothing else but to debar all access of galants and secure to myself the possession of a heart the least thing relative to which I can't bear to think any body should rob me of  Mar  In good truth you take a very wrong method and the possession of a heart is very ill secured when people think to keep it up by force For my part was I gallant to a lady in the power of another I shou'd bend all my  study to make him jealous For the way to forward such affairs is to take every advantage of the uneasiness and resentments which constraint and servitude create in the mind of a woman  Don  P  Very fine so according to this if any should make love to you he would find you disposed to receive his addresses  Mar  There's no knowing what a woman may be driven to in such a situation  Don  P  But I tell you it all proceeds from my love for you  Mar  If that be your way of loving I desire you to hate me  AIR  I  What state of life can be so blest  As love that warms a lover's breast  Two souls in one the same desire  To grant the bliss and to require  But if in heav'n a hell we find  'Tis all from thee Oh jealousy  Thou tyrant of the mind  II  False in thy glass all objects are  Some set too near and some too far  Thou art the fire of endless night  The fire that burns and gives no light  All torments ev'ry ill we find  In only thee Oh jealousy  Thou tyrant of the mind  Don  P  What and you give me no provocation I warrant to be jealous  Mar  No Sir I don't  Don  P  I know you don'tyou don't receive letters and send answers to them by your emissary Mrs Jezebel there who went out just nowyou don't encourage a fellow to come after you and you have not consented to run away from me and chouse me out of your fortune  Mar  How could he have heard this    Aside  Enter  Juletta  Jul  Sir there's a sailor below wants to speak to you he has brought you some news about one of your ships  Don  P  Let him come upand heark'e are you sure he is a sailorare you sure he has not given you a letter to deliver to your mistress and are you sure you don't want to get me out of the way while she writes an answer  Jul  Sir I despise such suspicions and I am not like my lady obliged to put up with them I thank my stars    Goes off  Don  P  There you see what you expose me to  Mar  Rather say that I see to what you expose yourself  Enter  Fabio  disguised as a sailor  Fab  Good cheer to the noble owner of the Antler galleon she is arrived safe with all her hands  Don  P  I am glad to hear it had you a pleasant voyage  Fab  If the young gentlewoman pleases I'll tell youYou must know that just as we made the land upon our starboardbowI was standing upon the forecastle singing a song made by one of our crew upon me and my sweetheartif the young gentlewoman pleases I'll sing it to you  AIR  I  The busy crew the sails unbending  The ship in harbour safe arriv'd  Jack Oakum all his perils ending  Had made the port where Kitty liv'd  II  His rigging no one durst attack it  Tight fore and aft above below  Long quarter'd shoes check shirt blue jacket  And trowsers like the driv'n snow  III  And thus his heart with pleasure stowing  He flew like lightning o'er the side  And scarce had been the boat's length rowing  When lovely Kitty he espied  IV  A flowing penant gayly flutter'd  From her hat all made of straw  Red like her cheeks when first she utter'd  "Sure 'twas my sailor that I saw"  V  And now the thronging crew surround her  And now secure from all alarms  Swift as a ball from a nine pounder  They dart into each others arms  Don  P  Adod you sailors are merry folks but I have a little business at present so if you'll let me know where I can find your captain I'll see him in the afternoon  Fab  Why if so be it was all one to you I'd steer you to him now for when he gave me the signal to hail you he said as how he wanted marvelously to haul alongside of you  Don  P  Well but I tell you I can't go now  Fab  Then I'll give you instructions what course you shall stand if the young gentlewoman pleases to hold these papers I have got the name  of the port somewhere here upon the back of a letter from poor Kitty here young gentlewoman  Don  P  Not quite so familiar with the young gentlewoman if you please  Fab  'Tis the way of us seamen we are always as the saying is in chace of a ship or a petticoat Here young gentlewoman you may read this if you please 'twill make you laugh you'll find how that Kitty  Don  P  Zounds we have nothing at all to do with Kittyheythis is a pander Shut the door theregive me that letter Madam  Mar  What letter Sir    Giving it to  Fabio  Fab  Why old gentleman you have unship'd your senses  Don  P  Give me that letter rascal  Fab  What shew you my letter from Kitty  Don  P  The devil Kitty youfetch me a horsewhip  Mar  For Heaven's sake what are you going to do  Enter  Lysander  and  Juletta  Don  P  How now who have we here  Lys  I beg your pardon but hearing a violent uproar in your house I thought some assistance might be necessary  Don  P  Sir I am much obliged to you but 'tis only a rascal I have detected disguised like a sailor  Jul    To  Fabio  Pretend to be

calls meDid you see my Kittythere she is climbing up the main top gallant mast  Lys  At the sight of me his interval is gone off Sir and I dare say we shall have work enough to force him away  AIR  Fab  Hark don't you hear the roaring main  The howling winds driving the rain  From every point of the compass blow  We fly to meet the thunder  And now again  Our leaky vessel dashing low  Pitches forecastle under  Lys  Force him away  Mar Jul  Poor soul poor soul  Fab  See on the billows how we rowl  Don  P  I'll rowl you dogbolt  Fab  Clear the ship  Don  P  Clear you the roomHere where's my

you Swains and hear my lay the next song in the book is the cobler or a wife of ten thousand Listen neighbours this is one of the curioustest ditties  AIR  I  'Twas in a village near Castlebury  A cobler and his wife did dwell  And for a time no two so merry  Their happiness no tongue can tell  But to this couple the neighbours tell us  Something did happen that caus'd much strife  For going to a neighbouring alehouse  The man got drunk and beat his wife  II  But though he treated her so vilely  What did this wife good creature do  Kept snug and found a method slily  To wring his heart quite through and through  For Dick the tapster and his master  By the report that then was rife  Were both in hopes by this disaster  To gain the cobler's pretty wife  III  While things went on to rack and ruin  And all their furniture was sold  She seem'd t' approve what each was doing  And got from each a purse of gold  So when the cobler's cares were over  He swore to lead an alter'd life  To mind his work ne'er be a rover  And love no other but his wife  Don  Pedro  and  Marcella  above at a window  Fab  Faith Sir the noise has brought her to the window  Lys  Dear Marcella how shall I express

Speaking as he goes of    I say that though the Dominicans what with  flattery to strangers confessional opportunities and imposing upon biggots gather together a pretty handsome portion of the good

have we here  Enter  Fabio  in a rich Spanish dress and  Lysander  Fab  Sir your servant I don't believe I have the honour to be known to you but understanding your reputation for courage and hearing you are generally engaged in an affair of honour about once a week  Don  P  Me Sir I assure you whoever told you so deceiv'd youthere is not a more peaceable man living  Fab  Ah Sir that is your modesty there is not a truer sign of courage in the world you'll find I have a great deal of it myselfMy name is Don Valasquez D'Avolos the history of Spain must have inform'd you of my conference  Don  P  It has SirThe devil fetch me if ever I heard of you before  Fab  Well Sir I came to ask your advice upon a point of honourThis way if you please that nobody may hear us    While  Fabio  draws  off Don  Pedro Lysander  slips into the house    You must know Sir that I have receiv'd a slap on the face I suppose Sir you know what a slap on the face is when it is given with an open hand in the middle of the cheekNow Sir this slap o'the face sticks mightily in my stomach and I am in doubt whether to revenge the affront I ought to fight my man or have him assassinated  Don  P  Assassination is the surest and shortest way  Fab  Well but Sir  Don  P  Sir you have my opinion and I kiss your hands  Fab  One word Sir  Don  P  I'm in a great hurry Sir and  Fab  Well Sir your humble servant I am infinitely obliged to you and when you receive a slap o'the face I shall as freely give my advice I hope master has made good use of his time    Exit  Don  P  Another pander zounds I shall surely tire them out at lastwhat a legion of plagues have I to encounter with  AIR  Great Hercules we've heard was a slave to Omphale  And all sorts of hardships submitted to daily  Still advent'ring in hopes to have her for his pains  What giants and monsters and snakes did he slay  What stables clean out and what birds drive away  Even lions that fool hardy at him shook their manes  With his club  Wou'd he drub  'Till he dash'd out their brains  So having an Omphale too Sir  Like him I have nothing to do Sir  But to ward off some evil design  Naywhat with sailors and madmen and singers and friars  And Jezebel jades bragadocios and liars  To neither side lean  And 'twill quickly be seen  That his labours were nothing to mine    Exit  Enter  Lysander  and  Marcella  Lys  Yes beautiful Marcella I love you more than life and I have no other thoughts no other end no other desire but to be yours for ever Have you then courage enough to consent to the design I mentioned to you  Mar  When love persuades how easily is one prevail'd upon to form a resolution  Lys  Do you consent then  Mar  Provided you promise that my hasty determination shall not alter your good opinion of me  Lys  No there is nothing can efface from my mind that gratitude with which it is inspired Love will ever protect its votaries when they feel a pure and sincere passion like ours and one smile from you arms me against a thousand dangers  AIR  Ah droop no more  The thunder's roar  That sounded deep and loud  Thank Heaven at last  Is gone and past  With every threatning cloud  Calm is the air  The

Lys  Don't seem to regard him but speak to me of what I told you  Mar  Upon my word Sir she's not in this house  Lys  Madam I shou'd not have been guilty of such an indecorum as to press in here so abruptly if I had not had the evidence of my own senses in my vindication  Mar  Well Sir I do assure you the person you seek for is not here and I cannot any longer refrain from telling you that your presence gives me great uneasinessfor if my guardian was to see you I don't know what the consequence might be  Don  P  Is all of this real I wonder or only hatch'd upthere can be no harm at least in sending him out of the houseWho are you and what's your business here  Lys  Sir I came to search for my wife who has escaped from my just indignation and fled into your house for shelter  Don  P  I do assure you Sir if I could prevail upon myself to credit you I don't know any thing I should sooner do than assist you but as I have a way of disbelieving what most people tell me and you among the rest I shou'd take it as a favour if you would suffer me to conduct you to the streetdoor  Lys  Sir this is very cavalier treatment but since that lady has assured me that my wife is not in your house I shall take my leaveNay Sir you need not give yourself the trouble to see me down    Exit  Don  P  Well upon second thoughts I'll stay where I amWithin theresomebody shew the gentleman outWell Madam

kind of life you expect me to leadbut Sir I despise your suspicions and if it was not that I have given my word nothing should compel me to marry you  Enter  Juletta  disguised and veiled  Jul  Oh good Sir save me from a furious husband who pursues me his jealousy is incredible and works him up to an excess beyond imagination he goes so far as to insist upon my always going veil'd and because he caught me with my face a little uncover'd he snatch'd up his sword and would have kill'd me Sir if I had not flown to your house for protection  Don  P  There was something then in this last affair I see  Jul  Oh Heaven's here he comes save me good Sir from his fury  Don  P  Take her to you bedchamber Marcellafear nothing Madam    Exeunt  Marcella  and  Juletta  Enter  Lysander  Lys  So Sir I had cause for what I said deliver her up to my just resentment this instant or meet it yourself  Don  P  Good Sir be a little patient the offence is too small for such violent anger  Lys  How Sir do you take her part You who are so delicate upon these sort of things  Don  P  No Sir I don't take her part but if you could be friends with her it would be a charity for the poor creature seeems frightened out of her senses  Lys  Don Pedro will it oblige you if I forgive her  Don  P  Truly it will for I love to see peace and harmony between married people  Lys  'Tis enough I'll lay by my anger and my sword together  Don  P  I'll bring her to you  Lys  This is the height moment that rewards me for all my pains and anxiety    Aside  Enter  Marcella  Don  P  You may appear I have made your peaceHere she comesYou'll promise me now not to relapse  Lys  I do Sir  Marcella  here comes on with  Juletta  's veil  D  on P  Poor soul how she trembles You really Sir should not put yourself

to conjure you both at my desire to live in perfect union for the future  Lys  Sir there's no refusing and I promise you since you desire it I'll endeavour to make her the best husband in the world  Don  P  Sir you give me pleasure to hear you say so  Lys  Nay no ceremony Sir  Don  P  Pray give me leave to see you outFor I half suspect that this is a trick    Aside    Exeunt  SCENE  the street

you that all our strife shall end from this moment    They go off  Don  P  Really one receives a pleasure in doing a friendly office for any oneHow loving they seemWell I'll go and secure Marcella's obedienceHey what's the meaning of this  Enter  Juletta  dissguised and without her veil  Jul  Why Sir the meaning is that a jealous  man's a monster hated by the whole world that all the locks and bolts in the universe are not capable of holding us that the heart should be secured by gentleness and complaisance that Marcella is in the hands of a gentleman and that you are caught for a dupe  Don  P  If there's justice to be had in Spain I'll be reveng'dshe shan't have a shilling of her fortunethey shall sue me for it however and then if I am obliged to part with it I'll hang myself that I
