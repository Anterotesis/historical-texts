 OBSERVATIONS RELATIVE CHIEFLY TO PICTURESQUE BEAUTY Made in the YEAR On several PARTS of GREAT BRITAIN PARTICULARLY THE HIGHLANDS of SCOTLAND  VOL II  By WILLIAM GILPIN A M PREBENDARY OF SALISBURY AND VICAR OF BOLDRE IN NEWFOREST NEAR LYMINGTON  LONDON PRINTED FOR R BLAMIRE STRAND  MDCCLXXXIX  OBSERVATIONS ON SEVERAL Parts of GREAT BRITAIN PARTICULARLY THE HIGHLANDS of SCOTLAND  SECT XXI  WE left the scenes of Inverary with regret those scenes in which the grand and beautiful are as harmoniously combined as we almost in any place remem∣bered to have seen them We approached it through magnificent woods and we left it through a succession of lakescenery still more magnificent Ten miles we travelled along the confines of LochFyne skirting that grand opening which it forms to the north east  It's skreens are every where equal to the expanse of it's waters They are indeed chiefly  naked and want some munificent hand to spread a little sylvan drapery upon their bare enormous sides But what they lose in beauty they gain in grandeur  Their situation also upon the lake operated as another cause to impress the idea of grandeur Nothing exalts the dignity of a mountain so much as it's rising from the water's edge In measuring it as it appears connected with the ground the eye knows not where to begin but continues creeping up in quest of a base till half the mountain is lost But a waterline prevents this am∣biguity and to the height of the mountain even adds the edging at the bottom which naturally belongs not to it Thus the moun∣tain of Doniquaick seen from the new inn at Inverary appears as if it rose from the water's edge tho in fact the duke of Argyle's lawn intervenes all which the mountain ap∣propriates and tho it measures only eight hundred and thirtyfive feet it has a more respectable appearance than many mountains of twice it's height unconnected with water  But these skreens tho the grand idea is principally impressed upon them are not totally devoid of  beauty  Two circumstances  in a lakeskreen produce this quality the line which it's  summits  form and the  waterline  which is formed by projections into the lake  See this subject treated at large in Observations on the lakes and mountains of Cumberland c p and    Of these modes of beauty we had great profusion and might have filled volumes with sketches but unless there is something in a scene besides these beautiful lines something which is striking and characteristic it has little effect we have seen in artificial landscape  Uncharacterized scenery is still less adapted to  drawing  the beauty of which depends chiefly on composition and the distribution of light In  painting  indeed colouring may give it some value but in  drawing  something more in∣teresting is required to fix the eye some consequential part to which the other parts of the composition are appendages  In our whole ride round this extensive bay of LochFyne we met only one object of any consequence to mark the scenery It was a ruined castle upon a low peninsula The lake spread in a bay before it and behind it  hung a grand curtain of distant mountains one of which is marked with a peculiar feature that of a vast ridge sloping towards the eye  We now approached the end of the lake where in the seaman's phrase we  raked  a long reach of it When we view it in this direction and conceive ourselves at the head of a bay of salt water sixty or seventy fathoms deep four miles in breadth and at least fifty from the sea we have a grand idea of the immense cavern which is scooped out between these ranges of mountains as the receptacle of this bed of waters If we could have seen it immediately after the diluvian crash or whatever convulsion of nature occasioned it before the waters gushed in what a horrid chasm must it have appeared  Ideas of this kind seem to explain a difficult passage in Tacitus In describing the Cale∣donian coast he observes that  Nusquam latius dominari mare multum fluminum huc atque illuc ferre nec litore tenus accrescere aut resor∣beri sed influere penitus atque ambire etiam jugis atque montibus inseri velut in suo  In vita Agric    Some explain this passage as if the sea would sometimes cover even the tops of the mountains Others among whom is the learned Gronovius  In a note in his edition of Tacitus which he seems to ap∣prove  laying the stress upon the word  ambire  and arbitrarily changing  velut in suo  into  velut insulis  make the sea instead of covering the mountains in it's rage only to surround them and form them into islands  Neither of these interpretations can well be the historian's meaning as they both imply the sea to be in an agitated state whereas he he had just before told us that these seas were scarce ever known to be agitated  Pigrum et grave remigantibus perhibent ne ventis qui∣dem proinde attolli  and this information he seems himself to have believed giving physical reasons such as they are to ascertain it's probability We are constrained therefore to illustrate this passage in some sense exclusive of that dominion of the sea which it exercises in a storm  Two other species of it's dominion over the land seem to be alluded to the dominion of tides and that dominion which it seems  to assert by running up in creeks into the country I shoud therefore translate the passage thus  Over no country the sea asserts more dominion In various parts it meets the mouths of rivers and not only washes the shores with the flux and reflux of it's tides but flows boldly up the country winds round vast stretches of hills and mountains and makes deep inroads into the land as if it were it's natural channel  There cannot be a better comment upon this passage than the western coast of Scot∣land which may in some degree therefore ascertain the truth of the translation  Having doubled the northern point of LochFyne we came to Carndow which consists only of a few inconsiderable houses and turning to the left we pursued our rout in quest of the scenes of LochLomond Our road led through the valley of Kinlas which is one of the wildest and most sublime vallies we had yet met with The two ranges of mountains which form it's skreens ap∣proach within two or three hundred yards We were immured between them  See a scene of this kind described in  Observations on lakes and mountains  c vol I p  Moun∣tains  brought near the eye like objects in a microscope appear monstrous They require distance to give them softness and remove deformities But these mountains had few deformities to remove They were magnificent and yet well proportioned bare of wood indeed but rich from a varied and broken surface  Their contrasts broad  And careless lines and undulating forms  Played through the varied scene  Through the valley ran a stream tumbling violently over the rocky fragments that op∣posed it's course and to compleat the gran∣deur of the whole the sky happened to harmonize with the mountains shaping the clouds into those grand forms which Virgil calls the  cava nubila coeli  and Shakespear still more expressively  the cloudy cheeks of heaven  those swelling forms which present so strongly the idea of puft cheeks Shake∣spear's idea may be inelegant but it is exact and the forms themselves are very picturesque  It is a happy circumstance when we find a sky thus suited to a landscape In point of  harmony of colouring  the sky and landscape seldom vary The former generally impresses  it's ruling tint on the latter But the  harmony of composition  is another point and is not always so exactly found Tho the general tint of the sky may be harmonious the clouds may still be ill formed and unpicturesque And it cannot be otherwise for among all the appearances of nature nothing assumes such variety of shapes as these floating bodies Amidst this variety there must often be bad forms The painter therefore takes care not only to impress the ruling tint of the sky on his landscape but also to get a good modu∣lation of the sky in that key if I may so speak which he hath chosen  No precise rules in the choice of a sky can be given nor in the adapting of skies to landscape This latter especially is matter of taste rather than of rule In general clouds in large masses like those which gave oc∣casion to these remarks are more beautiful than when they are frittered Large swelling fleecy clouds on a blue sky are often beautiful A few light floating clouds yet rather con∣tiguous in one part of the sky when the other part is of a uniform tint has the effect of contrast It is a beautiful species of sky also when the dark part melts gradually into  the lighter and this may be carried to the highest degree of contrast in a storm Breaks also in the sky when you see a light part through the disparting of dark clouds are pleasing And one or other of these species may be suited to all landscape The full meridian sun and clear etherial sky are sel∣dom chosen The painter commonly chooses his skies in a morning or evening which he thinks will inlighten his picture to the best advantage and give it the most brillian∣cy Of one thing he should be very care∣ful and that is to avoid all shapes of animals or other objects into which clouds are some∣times apt to form themselves I have seen a good picture spoiled from having the clouds formed in the shape of a swan From this mischief Shakespear may guard us  Sometimes you see a cloud that's dragonish  A vapour sometimes like a bear or lion  A tow'red citadel a pendent rock  A forked mountain or blue promontory  With trees upon't that nod and mock the eye  With empty air  Having travelled two or three miles in the valley of Kinlas we found the end of it closed by the skirts of a mountain which the road  ascends Here the river which in the valley was only a violent stream descends in a rougher manner through the several stages of the mountain and sweetened the toil of our ascent which was made on foot by exhibiting cataracts and waterfalls in great variety At the summit we found a small lake which was the reservoir of all these beautiful exhibitions The road we travelled is a miltary one and has been made at great expence of labour The toil it cost seems expressed by a sigh in an inscription on a stoneseat at the top  Rest and be thankful  The descent on the other side is a direct precipice but a zigzag road is contrived which is passable enough This road brought us into GlenCroey which is a scene of peculiar construction  GlenCroey is a valley which seemed to us about two miles in length tho it may be longer well proportioned in it's dimensions and skreened on every side by mountains as magnificent and as finely formed as those we had passed but it's peculiarity is this that altho in the neighbourhood of the wildest  and most rugged scenes yet contrary to the usual mode in which nature unites contiguous landscape it is totally smooth and almost polished The bottom of the valley consists chiefly of fine pasturage which cloaths also the sides of the mountains The softness of the herbage upon their distant sides appeared like a rich spreading velvet mantle Here and there the broken channel of a torrent had formed gutters in the declivities but in general all was quiet and unbroken Had this valley and it's lofty skreens been planted the scene would have been delightful The grandeur of the valley of Kinlas could support itself independent of wood but the valley of Croey inclining rather to the beautiful than to the sublime is not complete without that accompaniment  In the middle of the vale stands a lonely cottage sheltered with a few trees and adorn∣ed with it's little orchard and other appen∣dages We might call it a seat of empire Here resides the hind who manages and overlooks the cattle which in numerous herds graze this fertile vale and if peace and quietness inhabit not his humble mansion it does  not harmonize with the scene to which it belongs  From the valley of Croey we soon reached the banks of  LochLoung  or  the lake of ships  another saltwater lake in which according to the geography of Tacitus the sea is wont  influere penitus atque ambire etiam jugis atque montibus inseri velut in suo  In the account I have given of the two vallies which lye between LochFyne and LochLoung I have described the first as rough and the latter which is the valley of Croey as smooth I should not however conceal that I have seen the journal of a late traveller which inverts this order It makes the valley of Kinlas pasturage and Croey it describes as rocky I dare not take upon me to say I have made no mistake I can only say that my minutes were taken on the spot  LochLoung opposed our farther passage by it's extremity which formed the point of a bay This bay we skirted with so much pleasure that we could have wished the interruption had been greater As we  approach the vertical point it rose in value exhibiting a simple and very sublime piece of lakescenery Upon it's shores and rocks lie seaweed shells and other marks of a tide with alone shew it to be saltwater for it's banks have all the verdure and vegeta∣tion of an inlandlake  From the confines of LochLoung we had a short ride to Tarbet which stands upon LochLomond the scene we had so long expected  Tarbet  is a common name in Scotland for a town seated on an isthmus between two lakes which is the situation of this place a mere neck of land dividing LochLoung from LochLomond Some sup∣pose the word  Tarbet  to signify the same as a  Carryingplace  in America Here the scenes of LochLomond opened before us  SECT XXII  LOCHLOMOND is a fresh water lake about twentyfour miles in length It's northern end is narrow running up a con∣siderable way among lofty mountains but it widens towards the south by degrees and attains a great breadth Some say it's surface is observed gradually to increase and pre∣tend to shew the ruins of buildings far in the waters when they are in a transparent state But we saw nothing of the kind As this lake has ever been esteemed one of the most celebrated scenes in Scotland it will be proper to dwell a little upon it  Tarbet lies upon the narrower part of the lake from whence we took our rout to Luss which commands the broader The road accompanies the lake and is exceedingly grand and generally lofty in every part  Water and mountains are the removed part of the scene rocks and hanging woods adorn the foreground among which at every turn of the road the lake appears to much advan∣tage The whole road is exactly that path upon the grand scale of nature which is prescribed in the improvements of art  that path from whence the sight is led  Gradual to view the whole Where'er thou windst  That line take heed between the scene and eye  To vary and to mix thy chosen greens  Here for a while with cedar or with larch  That from the ground spread their close texture hide  The view entire Then o'er some lowly tuft  Where rose and woodbine bloom permit it's charms  To burst upon the sight Now through a copse  Of beech that rear their smooth and stately trunks  Admit it partially and half exclude  And half reveal it's graces In this path  How long soe'er the wanderer roves each step  Shall wake fresh beauties each short point present  A different picture now and yet the same  This road is one of the grand entrances into the highlands and a very formidable one it is It runs along the side of a moun∣tain and is in many parts a mere precipice hanging over the lake and tho secured suf∣ficiently for travellers is still a dangerous defile for an army The difficulty of making  it has been great In several parts it is cut through the solid rock which is left as a pavement and the grateful traveller finds himself indebted as an inscription with Roman brevity informs him to the labours of Colonel Lascelles's regiment  About three miles from Tarbet where the road rises we have a grand retrospect of the narrow part of the lake A mountain on the left near the eye runs boldly into the water beyond which the lake retires bay after bay in perspective among distant moun∣tains into it's deep recesses  The colouring of these mountains was very beautiful It was an early hour the sun just rising had not strength to dissipate the blue mists which hung upon them but yet it's faint radiance here and there tinged their broken points and shed an effusion of the soft∣est and most delicate light The effect too was assisted by the waters of the lake which in some parts were scarce distinguishable from the base of the mountains  There is a passage in the prophet Joel which I think nobly descriptive of such a scene as this He is describing the day in which the Lord cometh to execute judgment  It is a day  says he  of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darknessas the morning spread upon the mountains  Having been always therefore pleased with this passage particularly the last clause of it as a piece of sublime and picturesque imagery I was not a little disappointed in finding it animadverted on by so able a critic as the bishop of London in his excellent translation of Isaiah  See his note on Is viii  He allows the  morning  to be the  usual  sense of the Hebrew word in this place but as the same word also signifies  gloom  he rather prefers that word here because the  morning  he thinks is an  incongruous idea  If the bishop had ever paid any attention to the effects of morninglights in a mountain∣ous country which the prophet who had always lived in such a country probably did he would not perhaps have taxed the vul∣gar translation of this passage with  incongruity  By a very easy and elegant metonymy the morning which is the  cause  may stand for that  brightened gloom  which is the  effect  If on the other hand we understand by  the  morning  only a  gloom  the sentiment gains nothing It is a mere repetition  I would not be supposed to dispute a point of criticism with so great a master as the bishop of London but I may without vanity suppose myself better acquainted with the effects of morninglights in a mountainous country and may therefore be allowed to say that  the morning spread upon the mountains  is at least not an incongruous expression  At Luss we got into a boat and rowed to the middle of the lake where we lay upon our oars to take a view of the scenery around us  To the north we looked far up the narrow channel of the lake which we had just seen from the shore We were now more in the cen∣ter of the view But the scene was now shifted It was more a vista The mountains shelved beautifully into the water on both sides and the bottom of the lake was occupied by Benvorlie which filled it's station with great distinction On the right Benlomond the second hill in Scotland raised it's respectable head While the waters at their base were  dark like a black transparent mirror But in this point of view the form of Benlomond was rather injured by the regularity of it's line which consists of three stages of ascent In general however this mountain appears finely sloped and it's surface beautifully bro∣ken  Benlomond measures in height between three and four thousand feet from the surface of the lake extending it's skirts far and wide into the country It's lofty sides are subject to various climates and maintain various inhabitants The ptarmigan and other heathfowls frequent it's upper regions it's lower are saught as a favourite haunt by the roebuck while the many irriguous val∣lies and sheltered pastures at it's base tempt the peasants of the country to settle among them  By this time the early hours of sunrise had passed away The  morning spread upon the mountains  those velvet lights which we had seen from the Tarbetroad had now taken a more vivid hue and the vapours forming a more transparent medium began to discover through their thinner veil a fine purple tint  which had overspread the tops of the moun∣tains and is one of the most beautiful of all the hues that invest those lofty stations Poussin is so fond of it that in general I think he throws too much purple into his distances and the imagination of Virgil could conceive nothing beyond it in the Elysian fields where he tells us that a brighter sun spreads it's radiance upon the mountains  et lumine vestit  Purpureo  Purpureus often signifies  shining  or  glowing  but it is often descriptive of colour also and signifies  purple  Thus Horace speaks of  purpurit tyranni  and Ovid of  purpureus pudor  And where the term is applied to the colouring of a mountain I cannot conceive it can mean any thing but  purple    The view to the south has less value in  a picturesque light  The surface of the lake is broken by a number of islands which are scattered about it and prevent all  unity of composition  It's banks also in that direction are tame scenes of pasturage and cultivation and the mountains which skreened it's north∣ern regions are here removed As we could not therefore admire the southern part of the  lake as a  picture  we wished to examine it as a  map  and for this purpose we looked round for an advantageous point that might command a fair view of the whole  LOCH LOMOND  SECT XXIII  ON the western side of the lake is an island called Devannoc which rises at one end into a lofty hill To this island we steered and mooring our bark in a creek we ascended the hill under the conduct of our boatman who was a very intelligent guide The ascent cost us a full halfhour and we thought it somewhat extraordinary to find a hill of such dimensions upon an island in a lake When we gained the summit we seated ourselves upon a rock cushioned with moss and heath and as the day was fine we had indeed a most amusing view over all the south∣ern division of the lake  A vast expanse of water at least ten miles in diameter lay before the eye interspersed with various islands of different forms and dimensions Among these the little barks  which navigated the lake and plied among the several channels appeared and disappeared by turns dividing portions of land into islands which to the eye seemed united  The island or  inch  according to the Erse which lay nearest to us is Ghenaghan It is an island of considerable extent being not less than a mile in length It consists of great variety of high ground and is every where woody On the hither side it is in∣dented by a large semicircular bay which gives it a peculiar appearance  Beyond Ghenaghan lies InchCrune about half a mile in length flat unwooded and covered chiefly with pasturage  InchFad lies in the same direction beyond Crune and is nearly of the same dimensions flat also and unwooded  To the south between Crune and Ghen∣aghan lies Moin one of the largest islands in the lake It is flat it's shores are much indented one half of it consists of pasturage and the other of a peatmoss  Beyond InchFad verging towards the east∣ern side of the lake lies Inch Calloch or the  Isle of Nuns  which is about a mile in length It consists of high ground and is  very woody but the eye at so great a dis∣tance could not distinguish the indenting of it's shores This island which is regularly inhabited is in this respect of greater dignity than any other upon the lake It is remark∣able also on another account The clan of M'greggors who occupied the mountainous limits on the north of the lake and were proscribed by an act of parliament for their thefts and rapine had among them one very egregious superstition which was to lay their bones in this island where still appear the remains of a holyhouse Accordingly they have all been buried here from time imme∣morial presuming no doubt as men in all ages seem from sacrifices or other rites to have had some idea of atonement that the sanctity of the ground would deprecate the guilt of their lives  There is another reason however given for burying in islands which is practised also in other parts of Scotland When the country abounded with wolves it is said these animals would often attack churchyards against which the people guarded by insular graves Thus a practice founded in necessity might have been continued through superstition  To the southward of M'greggor's isle lie Grange and Torremach each of which islands is about half a mile in length both are woody but Torremach consists of higher ground  In the same direction lies the island of Merin the largest upon the lake being two Scotch miles in length which are nearly equal to three of English measure It's breadth also is proportionable measuring above a mile from one side to the other This island which is very woody and consists of high irregular ground is converted into a park by the duke of Montrose The keeper and his family are the only inhabitants which it contains Formerly this island was a place of more note and was dignified with a noble mansion built by the duke of Lenox  On the other side of M'greggor's island towards the north lies InchLonac formed in the shape of a crescent with some wood upon it but more heath This also is a considerable island being near two miles in length It is the property of Sir James Col∣quhoun who has turned it into a deerpark Commodious as these situations seem for deer a good paling is a better fence than a  lake however deep Often a herd banding together will venture through this vast expanse of waters in quest of better pasturage and it is one of the most laborious parts of the keeper's employment to pursue the emigrants and drive them home  In an opposite direction lies InchGalbrith This island the ospreyeagle inhabits in prefer∣ence to any other on the lake but for what par∣ticular advantages the naturalist is ignorant From his residence here he sends out his rapa∣cious colonies Fish is his prey but nature hath neither given him the power to swim nor the art to dive She has furnished him however with powers equally destructive With a keen eye he hovers over the lake and seeing from a great height some inadvertent fish near the surface he darts rapidly upon it and plung∣ing his talons and breast if need be into the water keeps his pinions aloof in the air undipped on the strength of which he springs upwards with his prey tho it is sometimes very bulky The osprey differs little from the seaeagle only he is more what is com∣monly termed a  freshwater pirate  Besides these larger islands there are others of smaller dimensions which are too numerous  for particular notice In any other place they would make a figure but here we consider them only as garnish to the rest We counted eighteen islands distinctly lying before us but we were told there are not fewer than thirty scattered over the lake three of which have churches upon them tho I believe now in ruins  One of these islands is observed alternately to sink and rise This is a common story among lakes and the mystery of it generally is that the water tho it's apparent form is rarely altered is yet sometimes so high as to cover an island which happens to be very flat I have heard however well attested stories of islands in some lakes that really rise and sink This may possibly be owing to fungous earth dilated by vegetation and detaching itself by it's lightness from the bot∣tom As it's vegetation ceases and it becomes of course more compressed and more saturated with water it loses it's buoyancy and sinks The fact I believe is unquestioned but I will not pretend to say that this solution accounts sufficiently for it  Besides this there is another kind of float∣ing island which hath been sometimes seen  upon this lake and hath confounded the eye of travellers and that is a sort of raft which the inhabitants used to make of a considerable size fastening the shafts of several pines toge∣ther and covering them with earth and clods These rafts were useful on many occasions I believe they are not now in use as boats are much more manageable and commodious But in elder times the raft was the first species of lakenavigation On it the inha∣bitants used to transport their cattle hay or any other bulky commodity from one part of the lake to another But the raft was principally of use in times of alarm When an adverse clan was laying waste the country some poor highlander would ship his family and moveables on board a raft and running under the lee of an island would attach him∣self to it His raft at a distance would appear a part of the island itself and lie concealed In the mean time he would rear a low hut of boughs and heath against the oak to which he was moored and would eat his oaten bread the only provision he carried with him and drink of the lake till a time of security gave him liberty to return  We were assured however that in a part of the country where we had lately been in the road between Killin and Tindrum there is a lake where a real floating island which never sinks continues always shifting about the lake We did not see it but we were told it is formed of the matted roots of a particular kind of weed It's surface which is now about fortyfive yards in cir∣cumference is supposed rather to increase If you bore it in three or four feet you come at water Sometimes as it rests near the shore the wild cattle are tempted in∣to it by a little fresh grass But it is a dangerous bait If the wind shift they may be carried off into unknown regions from all their kindred and acquaintance or as their provision is scanty if the voyage prove long they may suffer greatly by hunger  Islands of this kind were perhaps more common in ancient times The younger Pliny at least gives us an account of several which he had seen dancing about the Vadimonian lake in a very extraordinary manner  Inter∣dum junctae copulataeque et continenti similes sunt Interdum discordantibus ventis digeruntur Nonnunquam destitutae tranquillitate singulae  fluitant Saepe minores majoribus velut cymbolae onerariae adherescunt Saepe inter se majores minoresque quasi cursum certamenque desumunt Rursus omnes in eundem locum appulsae  Plin Epist lib viii ep    Besides the islands in LochLomond there are many peninsulas which run into it and add greatly to the variety of the scene Of these the most remarkable is that on which Sir James Colquhoun has his residence His seat and plantations were a great ornament to our view  The country immediately beyond the islands appeared flat and the mountains were too far removed to be of any picturesque use from the hill of Devannoc where we stood Among other objects of distance a strange form at∣tracted our notice It was something like a house only infinitely bigger than any house at that distance could possibly appear Upon enquiry we found it was the rock on which the castle of Dunbarton stands Our expec∣tation was of course greatly raised to see an object on the spot which had excited our curiosity so much at a distance  SECT XXIV  HIGH places and extended views have ever been propitious to the excursions of imagination As we surveyed the scene before us which was an amusing but un∣peopled surface it was natural to consider it under the idea of population  If commerce and wealth are the great means of improving the human mind by commu∣nicating knowledgefreeing it from prejudice giving it a more liberal turnencouraging lettersand introducing arts they as certainly at a riper period introduce corruption and become the handmaids of vice How happy then would it be to drop them at this critical period to arrest the precise time when they have done their utmost to enlighten mankind and then discard them But it would be as  easy to arrest the course of the river Human affairs like the plants of the field flourish only to decay they are longer lived indeed but the hope of preserving them in a state of perfection would be the futile hope of im∣mortalizing mortality  In a reverie however we may conceive the happiness of a few philosophical friends re∣tiring from the follies of life to such a scene as this and settling themselves in the several islands that are scattered about the lake before us Their happiness would consist in the refined pleasures of intercourse and solitude The visionary does not consider the many econo∣mical difficulties and inconveniences of a plan All these things are below his no∣tice He enjoys in idea the pleasure of a refined and virtuous society He feasts on the agreeable expectation that would arise at the sight of a sail making to his little retreat which he would know was fraught with wit or classic eleganceor the refinements of tasteor philosophyor the charms of an unaffected piety The contents of the cargo would be known at a distance from the di∣rection in which the vessel cameNor would the hours of solitude pass with less  delight However pleasing the charms of converse each member of this virtuous and happy society would still be his own best companion He who wants resources within himself can never find happiness abroad  Among the amusements of this happy peo∣ple it would not be the least to improve their little territories into scenes of simplicity and beautyacademic groves Elysian fields  Where they whom wisdom and whom nature charm  Stealing themselves from the degenerate croud  May sooth the throbbing passions into peace  And woo lone quiet in her silent walks  Even the dreariness of winter would not want it's enjoyments Winter is the reign of domestic pleasures and if the storms of the lake forbad the adventitious intercourse of agreeable society they would at least remove the impertinent interruptions of what was not so The intrusions of a tattling world would be totally excluded while books and ele∣gant amusements would be a sovereign anti∣dote against the howling of winds and the beating of wavesBut enough of these idle reveries which belong not to terrestrial things  When we descended the rocky hill from which we had these amusing views we sur∣veyed the whole island of Devannoc It seems to be one of the most beautiful on the lake and admirably adapted to be the seat of some capital mansion in such a scene as we have just imagined It cannot be less than two English miles in length and tho at the north∣ern end it is woody rough and even moun∣tainous as we have seen it's southern end affords both corn and pasturage We observed however but one solitary farm upon the whole place  Embarking again we spent some hours in rowing among that clump of islands which lie nearest the eye and in looking into their little creeks and bays tho we did not land on any of them Standing then for the shore we met our horses about five miles below the place where we at first embarked  Lochlomond was never known to freeze Partially indeed it has been sometimes frozen at the southern end but never in any degree since the memory of man except in the year But the northern part which runs  up among the mountains was never known at any time to receive even the slightest im∣pression from the frost  The southern part of Lochlomond is much frequented by salmon tho in general this fish is not fond of lakes But the case is this The river Leven forms the chief exit of the lake and communicates with the sea In a direction nearly opposite to the Leven the river Ennery enters the lake Of this river the salmon is particularly fond and enter∣ing by the Leven he traverses the lake on purpose to proceed up the Ennery By what instinct he knows that he shall find the stream he delights in across so vast an expanse of waters let the naturalist say Do the waters of the Ennery run pure through the lake to the Leven Or does the old salmon which hath once found the way discover it to the shoal Or shall we con∣fess our ignorance and suppose them guided by some instinct which we cannot com∣prehend  It is remarkable that at the beginning of November when the city of Lisbon was destroyed by an earthquake this lake  was exceedingly agitated The day was perfect∣ly calm and it's surface still when it's waters arose suddenly many feet in large swells and overflowed a considerable district Then in a moment or two retiring they sank as much below their usual mark Their next flow and ebb were less than the former but still very great and thus they continued rising and sinking for several hours till the fluctuation gradually subsiding the waters at length settled within their common bounds A boat which was thrown upon dry land was found by men∣suration to be forty yards from it's station in the lake and in some places where the land was low the waters rushed away and overflowed the country for a considerable ex∣tent Similar remarks were made at that time on other lakes  Since the year in which these observations were written an agitation in LochTay was still more remarkable than this in Lochlomond because no earthquake nor any other probable cause could be assigned for it It happened on sunday the th of september That day and the preceding day as in the former case were calm and the waters of the lake of course perfectly still when about nine o'clock in the morning a strange agi∣tation  was observed in that part of the lake which spreads into a bay before the village of Kenmore  See a description of LochTay vol I p  Great part of it is shallow but a little before it unites with the body of the lake it becomes very deep In this bay the agitation was first observed the water retired several yards within it's usual boundary and as it did in Lochlomond immediately flowed back again continuing to ebb and flow in the same manner three or four times during the space of a quarter of an hourwhen suddenly the waters rushed from the east and west with great violence and meeting in the place where the shallow waters and the deep unite arose in the form of a great wave in appearance at least five feet high leaving all the shores of the bay dry for the space of an hundred yards as nearly as could be conjectured The meeting of the two currents made a clashing sound but the force of that from the Kenmoreside overpowering the other carried the wave west∣ward It continued decreasing as it proceeded and in about five minutes disappeared How  great the force of the water was on the Ken∣moreside tho collected only from the shallow part appeared from it's overflowing it's natural boundary as the waves subsided several yards notwithstanding the chief part of the current went the other way After this violent agitation the water did not recover it's tranquillity for some time It continued eb∣bing and flowing but with less and less force at the interval of seven or eight minutes during the space of at least two hours after the subsiding of the great wave  While the waters of the lake were thus agitated the river Tay which issues from the lake at Kenmore ran backwards into it with so much force as to leave it's shores and in some parts it's channel quite dry It was curious to see the weeds which grow at the bottom and are smoothed by the stream flowing over them all bristling up and pointing in a contrary direction  On the day after this violent agitation of LochTay and on the four following days the waters were disturbed again in the same manner and about the same time but in a much less degree nor did those commotions intirely cease for a full month afterwards  but they became very irregular sometimes appearing in the morning and sometimes in the evening The th of october was the last day on which any disturbance was ob∣served on the lake  This account is taken from a letter written by the rev Mr Fleming minister of Kenmore to the rev Mr Playfair and by him communicated to the royal society at Edinburgh december th in whose journals it is published    SECT XXV  FROM the scenes of Lochlomond we made the best of our way to Dunbarton The lake bore us company on the left during most of the road appearing and disappearing by turns among the woods which shade it's banks The country is level cultivated and adorned with gentlemen's seats Near the road stands a pillar erected to the memory of the late Dr Smollet  The principal object during our ride along the banks of Lochlomond is Dunbartoncastle which still maintains that uncommon form which it first exhibited You begin now to distinguish it plainly into two parts one of which appears like a vast tent This appearance continues some time but as we approach nearer certain prominences which have a castlelike form indicate the whole to be a mass of fortified rock  A still nearer approach gives more distinctness of course to it's enormous features One of it's summits appears now higher and more pointed than the other and is adorned with a solitary watchtower The broader summit is occupied by the principal part of the castle and a wall flanked with towers fortifies the cleft between them This whole grand object comes in as a second distance and the Clyde skreened by mountains completes the picture by forming a third  When we arrive upon the spot the situation of Dunbarton castle appears indeed surprizing A vast rock steep on every side rising out of a plain and unconnected with any high ground for the space of a mile is one of those exhibitions which nature rarely presents It is almost surrounded on the north the west and the south by the Leven and the Clyde which latter is here a grand estuary On the east lies a morass  Such a rock as this is as uncommon at land as it is common at sea When the tides of the ocean gaining upon some continent force their way through a promontory and wash away the soil from the insulated part if it consist only of soil it presently disappears  But if there be any solid stratum of stone within that stratum when the soil is washed away becomes a rock It is covered with seaweed the only herbage the ocean produces which is the sport of the waves Virgil has given us the idea with great strength of expression  Spumea circum  Saxa fremunt laterique illisa refunditur alga  The pencil could not give the idea so precise The pencil gives only  form  and  colour  Virgil's description gives  motion  Numberless are the natural ruins of this kind which the tides of the ocean are con∣tinually forming in every part of the globe But such a landrock as this before us bare and insulated like the rocks of the shore is a wonderful appearance It is contrary to nature's whole process in forming rocks as far as we are acquainted with her works Her rocks are generally in some degree similar to the county in which they are found The rock on which the castle and city of Edin∣burgh stand it is true is of very peculiar construction yet it does not there so much surprize us Nature has been in that spot busily employed in making rocks She has  raised them all round the town in various forms and if she threw one out of her hands amidst the variety of her operations a little uncommonly shaped it is not much to be wondered at But an immense rock starting up on the level banks of the Clyde and on the edge of a morass where there is not only nothing similar to it but a face of country highly dissimilar is among those productions of which the globe of the earth does not afford frequent instances  The form of this grand fortress on a near inspection is very picturesque Such also is the contrast between the two summits The craggy sides of the rock are finely broken and the buildings upon it tho not in them∣selves beautiful have at least a good effect and give it consequence  We were curious to see the contents of this uncommon fortress and entering a gate at the bottom we ascended through a cleft of the rock Two hundred and eighty steps hewn out of the solid stone landed us upon the first story From hence we clambered the rock to view the works upon the broader summit to the other we never attempted to ascend the path is frightful  The square tower which we see at the division between the summits was once the residence of Wallace whose patriotic actions we have seen recorded in so many parts of the country  The texture of this rock we were told is of so impenetrable a nature as to baffle the effects of gunpowder Boring has often been attempted but the keenest instrument of the augerkind cannot touch it Buchanan indeed tells us that  Saxum illud est praedurum ut vix ullis ferramentis superabile e quo si quid vel vi effringitur vel ruinis collabitur sulfu∣reum late odorem expirat  This shews the labour of hewing two hundred and eighty steps out of it  The upper regions of the rock are profusely covered with the  lychen geographicus  which is one of the most beautiful of all vegetable incrustations I doubt not but these plants of the lychen kind tho they do not in ap∣pearance rise above the surface of the stone have their peculiar soils barren as we may esteem them as well as oaks or elms One loves a freestoneanother a purbeck and the species before us I am persuaded from many situations in which I have seen it  flourishes best on the hardest rock So beau∣tiful are the incrustations of the geographic species that if I had had time to trifle I could have amused myself with endeavouring to trace the several countries of Europe among their various forms I found a strong resem∣blance of the outlines of Great Britain  In the body of the rock is a reservoir of water collected from springs which affords a sufficient supply for any garrison which the castle can admit  From the batteries we had many very amusing views We had one up the Clyde towards Glasgow in which that river now a grand estuary forms two or three ample sweeps Dunglascastle is seated on a neck of land shooting into it Beyond the Clyde appears a rich distant country adorned with several seats among which Lord Semple's is conspicuous The town of Glagow we were told might be seen in a clear day but when we were at Dunbarton the weather was hazy  From an opposite part we looked down the Clyde where it expands into a vast sheet of water occupying almost the whole of the distance It's opening to the sea is intercepted  by a double range of mountains which mark the channel of Lochloung Into this lake the Clyde enters nearly at right angles Between the hithermountains you see the strait through which it passes and under those on the left lie the towns of Grenoc and PortGlasgow both of which are distinctly seen  Between these two grand views upon the Clyde we had a third towards the mountains of Lochlomond which appeared clustering around Benlomond in formidable array The intervening country is varied by the windings of the Leven  All these views would receive additional beauty from the peculiar circumstances of tides storms shipping haziness and lights We should have wished also to have seen the castle opposed to a setting sun The fractured sides of this noble rock would have received uncommon beauty from such a light But we had not the pleasure of seeing it under this or any other circumstance of peculiar grandeur It was an object however which was able to support it's dignity without any adventitious aids  Sallust gives us a picture very like Dun∣barton castle in the following description of  a Numidian fortress  Haud longè a flumine Mo∣lucha erat inter caeteram planitiem mons saxeus mediocri castello immensum editus uno peran∣gusto aditu relicto nam omnia natura velut opere atque consulto praeceps  Buchanan's description of Dunbarton runs thus  A confluente Glottae et Levini fluminum planicies circiter mille passuum ad proximorum montium radices extenditur In ipso autem an∣gulo ubi amnes commiscentur rupes biceps at∣tollitur Inter duo cornua quod in septemtriones versum est latus gradus habet per obliquam rupem hominum industria et magno labore excisos per quos vix singulis est aditus  So exact a similitude appears between these two descriptions that if we only reciprocally change the names of Numidia and Scotland Molucha and Clyde either description will serve for either scene  To these two descriptions I could add a third which Caesar gives us of Alicia in Gaul  Opidum erat in colle summo admodum edito loco ut nisi obsidione expugnari non posse videretur cujus collis radices duo duabus ex partibus flu∣mina subluebant Ante opidum planities circiter millia passuum tria in longitudinem patebat  Fortresses of this kind are always highly esteemed in the momentous periods of enterprize Sallust's fortress has a great event annexed to it in the time of Marius and Dunbarton has as remarkable a one in the times of Mary  It was at that period of disorder when Mary was imprisoned in England and all her kingdom was rent from her that Dun∣bartoncastle alone acknowledged her domi∣nion But tho single in her cause it's consequence was such that Fleming the governor would boast  He held the fetters of Scotland  A trifling accident humbled his pride Having punished the wife of a common soldier in the garrison for theft the husband an uxorious man persuaded of her innocence and burning with revenge deserted to the regent and promised to make him master of the fortress The man appeared confident sensible and resolute his story simple consistent and plausible In short the military men about the regent thinking the attempt worth hazarding provided lad∣ders and other necessaries and began their march from Glasgow on the evening of the last day of march  Buchanan indulging the imagination of a poet tells the story with many embellish∣ments A simple narrative tells it best  It was about midnight when the troops arrived at the bottom of the rock The moon was just setting and a mist from the water had overspread the upper regions of the castle which the officers considered as a fortunate circumstance the men as a lucky omen  The attempt was made at a part of the rock where their guide assured them they should find two good landings Their first operation was unsuccessful A ladder which had been placed in confusion gave way and tho nobody was hurt yet they feared an alarm Listening a moment and finding all still they proceeded again and placing their ladders with more caution many of the troops attained the first landing Here the stump of an ash tree firmly interwoven with the rock was of great service to them They tied cords around it and while some were employed in drawing up their companions to the first landing others made use of the ladders in scaling the second  On one of the ladders happened an odd circumstance A man in the middle of the  ascent was seized with convulsions To stop was dangerous to throw him down inhuman Necessity quickens invention They bound him tight to the ladder and turning it round ascended over his breast The whole party arriving thus by degrees at the second landing they found the only obstruc∣tion now left was a wall which was yet of such height as to require a third application of the ladders The day was dawningthey had not a moment to losewith redoubled dispatch they made this last push  Then first three drousy centinels took the alarm but many of the assailants being now upon the wall which was lower within they leapt down at once followed by the rest The centinels were dispatched  God and the King  was echoed with loud shouts on all sides the security of the garrison was instantly changed into confusion and the castle was taken without striking a blow  The town of Dunbarton lies about a mile from the rock It is an inconsiderable place and delayed us only for refreshment From hence we proceeded to Glasgow  SECT XXVI  AS we leave Dunbarton the castlerock in retrospect loses it's doubletop and takes rather a heavy form  Dunglascastle is the next object we meet It appears to stand upon a peninsula which runs into the Clyde and being adorned with a back ground of mountains makes a good picture  The road to Glasgow continues for many miles along the banks of the Clyde which is still a grand estuary and covered with shipping of various forms The country is well cultivated but tho woody it is not pic∣turesque The Clyde seldom forms a wind∣ing bay It's banks are generally parallel  Glasgow is a beautiful town and contains a great number of elegant houses If they were a little more connected the high street which is ample in it's dimensions would in  all respects be noble The separation of the houses no doubt hath it's conveniences but so many breaks injure the perspective The great church is a vast pile but we saw nothing very pleasing in it's structure and it accords ill with the modern splendor of the city  Here we were told of a small Gothic chapel at Paisley within a few miles of Glasgow which is remarkable for a very surprising eccho The flap of a door is converted into a peal of thunder and a melodious air losing all idea of earthly music becomes an inchanted strain  From Glasgow to Hamilton the road is bare of objects The only one of consequence is Bothwellcastle of which we have a very ordinary view on the right It appears to stand on a flat and is discovered only by two or three detached parts which scarce appear above the trees that surround it whereas in fact it is seated on an eminence and overlooks the Clyde From this side I have seen two or three good drawings of it's ruined towers Bothwellcastle in the time  of Edward the first was the residence of the English governor It afterwards belonged to a man the most notoriously marked of any in the annals of Scotland for the audacity and splendour of his crimes  Hamiltonhouse which we soon approached disappointed us both in prospect and on the spot It had the appearance of one of the most disagreeable places we saw in Scot∣landheavy awkward and gloomy From it's form indeed nothing beautiful could re∣sult It is a centre with two very deep wings tacked to it at right angles Nor did we see any thing in the situation that was pleasing  The awkwardness of the house indeed was an original error which could not be cor∣rected without rebuilding but I am in∣formed the park the approach to the house and the whole scenery around it are intirely altered and improved since these observa∣tions were made Two winding rivers the Clyde and the Avon flow through the park of which proper advantage is taken There is also much greater variety of ground about it than could have been supposed before the incum∣brances  were removed Advantage also has been taken of some clumps of very fine old oaks which grow in the park and which greatly adorn the banks of the Avon To these many new plantations have been added which are in a very thriving condition In short tho Hamilton does not enjoy that gran∣deur of situation which we admire at Hope∣tonhouse and Inverary yet as a parkscene I am informed it is now become superior in richness and picturesque beauty to any thing of the kind in Scotland The internal part of the house too has been greatly improved The hall particularly which was a gloomy and disagreeable entrance is now I am told an elegant room decorated in a grand yet simple style  The dukes of Hamilton seem to have been copious collectors of pictures of which there is great profusion in every room In general one should not say much for the taste with which these collections have been made A few are very good In the gallery hang two or three excellent portraits by Vandyck among which the earl of Denbigh is a masterpiece He is dressed in a redsilk jacket and holds a gun in his hand His hair is short and  grey and he looks up with a countenance so full of nature and character that you are amazed the power of colours can express life so strongly This picture is by some attributed to RubensIn a closet hangs a small female profile by Vandyck which is equal to any picture I have seen by that pleasing master  But the glory of Hamilton is Daniel in the lion's den by Rubens It would per∣haps be doing more than justice to it's merit to rank it above the most capital pictures by this master in England two or three of those especially in the possession of the duke of Marlborough and that celebrated one of Simon's supper at Houghtonhall  Now sent to Russia  but without entering into any invidious compa∣rison it is certainly a noble work  The prophet is represented sitting naked in the middle of a cave surrounded by lions An opening at the top through which he had been let down affords light to the pic∣ture In his face appears ineffable expression Often do we hear the parading critic in a gallery of pictures displaying the mixed pas∣sions  where they never existed For myself indeed I cannot see how two passions can exist together in the same face When one takes possession of the features the other is excludedBut if the mixed passions ever did exist any where they exist here At least from the justness of the representation you are so intirely interested in the action that the imagination is apt to run before the eye and fancy a thousand emotions both of hope and fear which may not really exist The former appears the ruling passion but a cold damp sweat hangs evidently on the cheek the effect of conflict The whole head in∣deed is a matchless piece of art Nor is the figure inferior The hands are clasped agony appears in every muscle and in the whole contracted form And indeed so far I think we may admit the mixt passions one passion may take possession of the face and another of the limbs We may allow for instance a mother to clasp her infant in her arms with all the tenderness of love while her features are marked with terror at the soldier who strikes it with his sword In the same way we may here allow the hands to be clasped in agony while hope alone is seated  in the face In a word nothing can be more strongly conceived more thoroughly understood more delightfully coloured or more delicately touched than this whole fi∣gure I should not indeed scruple to call it the noblest specimen I have ever seen of the art of Rubens It is all over glowing with beauties without one defect At least it had no defect which I was able to dis∣cover  But altho the principal figure on which I dwell because it is so very capital exceeded my expectation yet the whole of the pic∣ture I must own fell beneath it  The composition is good The lions of which there are six with two lionesses are well disposed and stand round the prophet with that indifference which seems to have arisen from a satiety of food One is yawn∣ing another stretching and a third lying down An artist of inferior judgment would have made them baying at the prophet and witheld by the Almighty from devouring him as a butcher restrains his dog by a cord The only fault I observed in the composition arises from the shape of the picture The painter should have allowed himself more  height which would have removed the open∣ing at the top to a greater distance and have given a more dismal aspect to the inside of the den At present the opening is rather paltry This has induced some judges to suppose what does not seem improbable that the picture was not originally painted on one great plan but that the painter having pleased himself with the figure of Daniel added the appendages afterwards  But the great deficiency of this picture is in the distribution of light No design could possibly be adapted to receive a better effect of it As the light enters through a con∣fined channel at the top it naturally forms a  mass  in one part of the cave which might  gradually fade away  This is the very idea of  effect  The shape of the mass will be formed by the objects that receive it and if bad they must be assisted by the artist's judgment Of all this Rubens was aware but he has not taken the full advantage which the circumstances of his design allowed A grand light falls beautifully upon his prin∣cipal figure but it does not graduate suffi∣ciently into the distant parts of the cave The lions partake of it too much Whereas  had it been more sparingly thrown upon them and only in some prominent parts the effect would have been better and the grandeur and horror of the scene more striking Ter∣rible heads standing out of the canvas their bodies in obscurity would have been noble imagery and have left the imagination room to fancy unpictured horrors That painter does the most who gives the greatest scope to the imagination and those are the most sublime objects which are seen in glimpses as it weremere corruscationshalf view∣less formsand terrific tendencies to shape which mock investigation The mind startled into attention summons all her powers di∣lates her capacity and from a baffled effort to comprehend what exceeds the limits of her embrace shrinks back on herself with a kind of wild astonishment and severe delight Thus Virgil describing the Gods who in∣veloped in smoke and darkness beat down the foundations of Troy gives us in three words  apparent dirae facies  more horrid ima∣gery than if he had described Jupiter Juno and Pallas in a laboured detail with all their celestial panoply For when the mind can so far master an image as to reduce it within  a distinct outline it may remain grand but it ceases to be sublime if I may venture to suggest a distinction  This distinction I think is just but for want of a suffi∣cient variety of terms we are obliged often to use the words  grand  and  sublime  as synonymous  It then comes within the cognizance of judgment an austere cold faculty whose analytic process carrying light into every part leaves no dark recesses for the terror of  things without a name  Rubens in managing his lions has erred against these precepts He has injudiciously shewn too much Besides a little more shadow would have concealed his ignorance in leonine anatomy for it must be confessed the lions are not only very slovenly painted  I have been informed that this appearance of a  slovenly manner  is owing only to the bad light in which the picture hangs but that in fact the lions are painted in a very highfinished style I can speak only as the picture appeared to me It certainly hangs in a bad light  which capital as they are should not have been the case but in many parts they are very ill drawn The lioness in particular on the right instead of the gaunt leonine form has the roundness of a coachhorse Some of the heads at the same time are  admirableI have dwelt the longer on this picture not only as it is in itself a very noble one but as it is esteemed the first picture in Scotland  About a mile from Hamiltonhouse stands an appendage of it called Chatelherault the name of certain ancient possessions which the Hamilton family enjoyed formerly in France It is a sumptuous pile but contains the odd assemblage of a banquettinghouse and a dogkennel It stands on a rising ground near the Avon the banks of which river form a deep woody dell behind it open in many parts and in general wider and of larger dimensions than these recesses are commonly found Fre∣quent as they are in mountainous coun∣tries and rarely as they are marked with any  striking or peculiar  features yet they are always varied and always pleasing Their sequestered paths the ideas of solitude which they convey the rivulets which either sound or murmur through them their interwoven woods and frequent openings either to the country or to some little pleasing spot within themselves form together such an assemblage  of soothing ingredients that they have always a wonderful effect on the imagination I must add that I do not remember ever meeting with a scene of the kind which pleased me more than the wild river views about Chatelherault  SECT XXVII  IN our way to Drumlanrig which was the next place we proposed to visit we passed over vast wastes and barren tracts the same kind of country we had met with on our entrance into Scotland But the beauty of the scene was greatly altered We had then grand mountains which tho void of furniture formed pleasing lines and con∣trasts Here every picturesque idea was blotted out and yet the countries were nearly the same A mere accident made all the differ∣ence We saw one in sunshine and the other in rain A dismal hue was not only thrown over the country but the eye that surveyed it was put out of humour and in a habit if I may so speak of taking offence at every thing  From the rising grounds a little to the right from the road was pointed out to us Eliockhouse We saw it through the rain or at least were made to believe we saw it seated on an eminence and bosomed in wood  The most remarkable circumstance of this house is that it was formerly in the possession of Robert Crichton the father of the cele∣brated James Crichton who is represented as one of the most singular characters of his own or of any other times  His history is thus told He was bred at the university of St Andrew's where his improvements ran before his instructors By the time he had attained his twentieth year he could speak and write correctly either in prose or in verse ten different languages Hebrew and Arabic were two of them He was perfectly acquainted also with the whole circle of the sciences as far as they were then taught  His accomplishments were equal to his acquirements Nobody danced so well as Mr Crichton Nobody sung so agreeably He could join the concert with any instrument  that happened to be vacant Exercises of every kind he performed with superior excel∣lency In the field he rode with uncommon grace and he handled arms of every kind with surprising skill So that it was difficult to say whether in the active or sedentary line he was the more wonderful man  Thus furnished at home he travelled abroad for farther improvement He went to Paris to Rometo Veniceto Mantua But in none of these universities he received any ac∣quisition of knowledge He had already made every thing his own Admiration at his skill in arts in sciences and arms was all he acquired In the mean time he was a com∣panion for all sorts of people He could be serious or he could be gay He could reason with the philosopher talk with the man of business or trifle with the ladies and they who were no judges of his parts and learning admired the qualities of his heart the elegance of his manners and the beauty of his person In a word he acquired in all places the title of the  admirable Crichton  and under this name he is handed down to posterity  To say the truth a relation of this kind calls for strong vouchers In the history of mankind no other such instance occurs The accounts we have of Alcibiades sir Phil∣lip Sydney and the chevalier Baynard fol∣low far behind In versatility of genius in learning acquirements and accomplishments Crichton far outstripped them all We should require strong proof to believe that the human figure in any instance ever attained the height of eighteen or twenty feet We require equal proof to believe so enormous a growth of the human mind A paper which Mr Pen∣nant has given us in his Scotch journal bears the only appearance I know of any anthentic evidence for the wonderful accounts we have of this singular man From that paper this slight sketch of him is taken The reader may there see his life and actions at large and the authority on which the account rests  The sequel of the story of Crichton is that as he was walking at the time of a carnival in the streets of Mantua singing and playing carelessly on his guitar he was attacked by six people in masks and treacherously slain after he had gallantly defended himself against them all and beaten off the attack  In the dreary regions in which we now travelled we met the Clyde wandering about in a very low condition It is here much nearer it's fountainhead and carries no pro∣gnostics about it of that glory which it after∣wards assumes at Dunbarton  But tho it cannot produce here that expanse of water which it displays on it's approach to the ocean yet it has water enough to assume a character of magnificence in another style Near this place it happens to meet with a variety of grand accompaniments rockswoodsand hilly grounds which it turns to great advantage in forming among them many noble falls But from our not being apprized of this scenery we were not so fortunate as to see it tho it would have carried us very little out of the common road I had an opportunity however of asking several ques∣tions about it and received very intelligent answers from which and my acquaintance with the subject in general I am enabled to give such an idea of it as may excite the curiosity of others to profit more from the intelligence than we were able to do  These falls are to be found at a place called CoryLin near Lanerk From a lofty seat in a gentleman's garden we were informed the first of them is seen to most advantage You look over the tufted tops of trees and see the river beyond them precipitating itself from rock to rock a considerable way rather pouring along as we understood through an abrupt slope than down a perpendicular descent The two cheeks are rugged pre∣cipices adorned with broken rocks On the edge of one of these cheeks stands a solitary tower A path if you choose to follow it leads to the top of the fall where from a projecting rock which in high floods is severed from the continent you have a tremendous view down the furious cataract as it pours below the eye You may carry your curiosity yet farther and by walking half a mile may see the still more celebrated fall of Boniton and two or three more I believe beyond it In idea all this scenery is grand and pic∣turesque The imagination with such ma∣terials may make noble pictures And indeed I suppose the whole is in itself admirable It is  art  commonly and not  nature  that disappoints us  In our travels through Scotland I have mentioned many scenes which were ennobled by being called the retreats of Wallace This was one Among these wild rocks and in the tower that adorns them we were told he lurked during a period of distress These traditional anecdotes whether true or fabled add grandeur to a scene and the variety of these hiding places which the Scotts have every where provided for Wallace in his mis∣fortunes shew at least their gratitude and affec∣tion for one of the noblest heroes which their own or any other country hath pro∣duced  The hills among which we now travelled are supposed to abound with lead tho many projectors have suffered by seeking it A celebrated schemer  Sir George Colebrooke who made this purchase of the earl of Selkirk  purchased lately a large estate in this country at an advanced price with a view to work it but his enterprize either miscarried or was never executed  It fared better a few years ago with an∣other projector at Leadhill a little to the right This gentleman whose name was Lo∣thian had long sought ore in vain Many a time in despair he resolved to desist but his workmen raised his spirits with fresh hopes The rock was just cut through which had occasioned so much delay or the soil was manifestly marked with the signs of ore or springs were found which had the undoubted mineral tinge Thus deluded by false hopes he went on till ruin stared him in the face  At this crisis of his fortunes a boy who wrought in the mine came secretly to him and told him he was deceived by his work∣men and that a vein of ore had been dis∣covered and secreted Tho the boy was un∣acquainted with the depth of the roguery Lo∣thian easily guessed it These knaves were first to ruin him and then to take the works them∣selves at an underrateThe difficulty was how to profit by the information without dis∣covering the informer for the boy declared with tears that he should be murdered if the thing were known Lothian bad him fear nothing and ordered him to saunter about the place where the vein was discovered at such an hour  the next morning "At that time said he I shall enter the mine and seeing you idle shall pretend to be very angry when you in a passion may throw down your tool as near as possible to the place where the vein was found" The scheme was as well executed as contrived Lothian finding the boy in a place where he seemed to have no business rated him roundly for his idleness and re∣ceiving an insolent answer which among illpaid workmen was not uncommon struck him two or three times upon which the boy with great address counterfeiting a passion threw his tool out of his hand and said he would work for him no longer Lothian marked the spot with unobserved attention and giving him two or three more blows for his insolence and bidding him go about his business went on himself among the other workmen asking his usual string of questions and receiving his usual string of answers At length he took up a tool and begin∣ning carelessly to pick about the chambers of the mine in various places came by degrees to the spot he had marked where picking a little about the surface he seemed surprized and calling some of the men he asked them  if they did not think there were plain indica∣tions of ore The men were of a different opinion and assured him that such appear∣ances were very common and not in any degree to be trusted Lothian however still continued picking about and told the men he could not be satisfied unless they took their tools and went a little deeper With some reluctance as being taken from work of more importance the men complied But they had not occasion to go deep A very few strokes convinced all who were present not only that there was ore but that the vein was uncommonly rich The honest workmen joining in the farce asked each other with astonishment How they could possibly work so near the place without dis∣covering it In short there was a universal joy on all sides on having found at length what they had so long sought in vain  The mines here as in all mineral coun∣tries are destructive of health You see an infirm frame and squalid looks in most of the inhabitants And yet among the miners of Leadhill within these six years a man of the name Taylor attained the age of one  hundred and thirtytwo years and as we were informed with the perfect use of all his fa∣culties He wrought at his profession as a miner till he was one hundred and twelve In the mean time as if with patriarchal pre∣cision he had foreseen the extent of his days he did not marry till he was sixty years of age and left behind him nine children whom he lived to see provided for  In the midst of this wild country night came upon us But it's shades were unac∣companied with any picturesque ideas Often when mountains forests and other grand ob∣jects float before the eye their sweeping forms clad in the shades of evening have a won∣derful effect upon the imagination But here the objects were neither grand nor amusing All was one general blot  As we approached Drumlanrig the country appeared greatly to improve in beauty The forms of trees swept past us and we were often carried along the sides of dells and heard the sound of waters through the stillness of the night Such objects beguiled the hours which began now to verge on midnight  SECT XVI  OUR inn was about a mile from Queens∣berryhouse which we visited early the next morning It's appearance as we approach it is magnificent It is a turrited square seated among woods and skreened by woody hills  When we arrived on the spot it still maintained it's magnificence tho there is little beauty in the architecture It was begun immediately after the civil wars of Charles the first and partakes of the unsettled condition of the times Arts were beginning to flourish but the animosity of chiefs still subsisted and the laws were yet too feeble to repress it The house seems therefore to have been formed on a plan neither of civil nor of military architecture but between both tho beauty such as it is seems to have been more attended to than defence It  occupies the four sides of a square and it's turrited walls being very lofty the area within excluded from sun and wind becomes a mere reservoir for unwholesome damps which it communicates abundantly to the whole house The chambers have no magnificence and we observed scarce a single picture to engage the eye tho there is a gallery above an hundred feet long which is full of pictures  But if there are few ornaments of this kind there is no deficiency of other ornaments both within the house and without among which the  Heart  the ensign armorial of the house of Douglas appears every where in great profusion In England perhaps the history of the  Heart  is little known but in Scotland every body has heraldry enough to know that it was given to the Douglas family in honour of Sir James Douglas who was employed to carry the heart of Robert Bruce into Palestine there to be interred under the altar of the holy chapel at Jerusa∣lem But it is generally imagined this pre∣cious deposit never got there It was inclosed in a golden urn and hung round Sir James's neck who took shipping accompanied by two hundred knights As the vessel was  sailing near the coast of Spain Sir James had intelligence that king Alphonso was just on the eve of a battle with the Moors The Douglasses always loved fighting and Sir James could not forego his inclination to this favourite amusement He landed therefore with his companionswent to the royal pavilion and offered his services to the king which were graciously accepted The battle began and among all the heroes that en∣gaged none distinguished himself like the knight with the golden urn It unfortunately however happened that as he ventured too far he was slain and despoiled of king Ro∣bert's heart But before the battle ended both it and the dead body of Douglas were recovered by the bravery of the Spanish troops and sent back into Scotland The body was buried in the buryingplace of the family near Douglascastle where Sir James's effigy still remains and the heart is said to have been deposited in the abbey of M  lross  But if the house at Drumlanrig afforded us little amusement the situation of it made amends It stands on a rising ground on  the side of a vast sweeping hill surrounded by mountains at the distance of two or three miles This is one of the grand situations which a mountainous country affords and it is often as beautiful as it is grand but it's beauty depends upon the elegant lines which the surrounding mountains form upon their recesses their ornaments their rugged surface their variety and contrast It depends also upon the contents of the area within the mountains it's hills it's broken grounds it's woods rivers and lakes  Here  the mountainskreens in themselves have no peculiar beauty but the circular vale which they inviron and in which the house stands is so broken by intervening hills so adorned with rivers and varied with wood that many of it's scenes are beautiful and the whole greatly diversified  A situation however of this kind circum∣scribed by hills which keep the eye within bounds must always want one of the greatest beauties of naturean  extensive distance  Nor will any species of landscape fully compensate the deficiency We may have the tinted hill the middle distance and the rough foreground where the sun  Turns with the splendor of his precious ray  The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold  But still we want  the charms of laughing vales  Rocks streams and sweeping woods and antique fanes  Lost in a wild horizon  The more confined landscape would suit very well a mansion less than superb but such a mansion as Queensberryhouse tho it's situation is good would stand yet to more advantage if it commanded a country  The garden front of Queensberryhouse opens on a very delightful piece of scenery The ground falls from it near a quarter of a mile in a steep sloping lawn which at the bottom is received by a river and beyond that rises a lofty woody bank All these objects are in the grandest style except the river which tho not large is by no means incon∣siderable  It is amazing what contrivance has been used to deform all this beauty The descent from the house has a substratum of solid rock which has been cut into three or four terraces at an immense expence The art of blasting rocks by gunpowder was not in use when  this great work was undertaken It was all performed by manual labour and men now alive remember hearing their fathers say that a workman after employing a whole sum∣merday with his pickax could carry off in his apron all the stone he had chipped from the rockHow much less expensive is it in general to  improve  the face of nature than to  deform  it In improving we  gently follow  in deforming we  violently oppose  The duke of Queensberry of that day who carried on these works seems himself to have been aware of his own folly He bundled up all the accounts together and inscribed them as I have been informed with a grievous curse on any of his posterity who should ever look into them  The rough hand employed in these scenes having dispatched the slope proceeded next to the river All it's winding simplicity it's rocky channel it's woody furniture and fringed banks were destroyed at once and formed by making a  head  into an oblong canal  The grand wooded bank beyond the river still remained an object for improvement At a great expence a little stream was con∣ducted  from the neighbouring hills to it's summit There a most magnificent cascade constructed of hewn stone and consisting of innumerable steps received it and conduct∣ed it in state into the canalSo vile a waste of expence as this whole scene exhi∣bits we rarely meet with Deformity is spread so wide through every part of it that it now exceeds the art of man to restore it again to nature The indignation of the poet seems to have been levelled at this very place where after various instances of false taste he at length speaks of  deformities of hardest cure  The terrace mound uplifted the long line  Deep delved of flat canal and all that toil  Misled by tasteless fashion could atchieve  To mar fair Nature's lineaments divine  SECT XXIX  ALL the environs however of Queens∣berryhouse are not of this formal cast Very near it runs the rapid river Nith winding between high sloping woody banks It's channel is a continued bed of rock and the water in passing through suffers a thou∣sand obstructions The scene is of that kind we found at Chatelherault which tho fre∣quent in mountainous countries is always varied and always pleasingAlong one of the woody sides of this sweet dell the duchess of Queensberry's taste has conducted a simple walk which winds beautifully and at every turn commands some part of the rocky river below There is a great profusion of wood all round the duke of Queensberry's house  and in these scenes particularly it flourishes both in abundance and in perfection  The present duke I am told has not been so attentive to the preservation of his timber as his pedecessor Many of the woody scenes here mentioned have now lost much of their ornament    In one of his parks we were informed the duke had preserved a breed of the old Scottish buffalo which we were very desirous to see Our conductor told us they might probably be in some distant part of the park and might with difficulty be found We determined however to go in quest of them It was high noon and the day was sul∣try the cattle it was therefore supposed might be at that time in a valley which is spread with a large piece of water Thither we directed our course and beneath the shelter of a thick wood we walked at ease  In less than a mile we came in sight of the water The banks of the pool for it had not the dimensions of a lake were adorned with clumps and single trees and on the opposite side a hanging grove swept down to the water It was an open grove and the ground was covered with herbage as far as the eye could penetrate it's recesses  This delicious scene the luxurious herd had chosen for their noontide retreat where we discovered them at a distance reposing on the other side of the water Our guide informed us they were rather shy and in∣structed us to walk on without stopping or paying them any particular attention We had the pool to walk round so that we had them long in view before we came near them As we approached they rose and retired gently into the wood but gave us sufficient opportunity to examine them There were two bulls and several cows and some calves They were milk white except their noses ears and the orbits of their eyes which were black Boethius speaks of this breed of cattle as  boves candidissimos in formâ leonis jubam habentes caetera mansuetis simillimos  and Polidore Virgil mentions them nearly in the same language  Gignit sylva Calydonia boves candidos instar leonum jubatos qui adeo feri sunt ut domari non possint Sed quia caro grata palato humano est ferunt omne penè eorum genus extinctum  As to their lionmanes we saw no such appearance but indeed we saw them in dis∣habille as all cattle are in their sleek summer  attire In winter their shaggy fur is more picturesque and it is probable their manes may then be luxuriant We see a great pro∣fusion of mane often in our domestic cattle at that season especially when they winter abroad in mountainous countries I have often observed the remains of it even in the month of June It is possible also that the degree of domestication in which these cattle are now placed may have deprived them gradu∣ally of this ornament But in all other respects except the mane the cattle we saw in the duke of Queensberry's park answered very exactly to Boethius's description of the Scot∣tish buffalothat is  they very much resembled common cattle  Their form indeed is some∣what more elegant They have not that bulk of carcass nor heaviness which characterizes the common cow There is a spirited wild∣ness also in their looks and when they run instead of the clumsy cowgallop they bound like deer A herd of them rushing at once over a lawn makes the forest tremble  One of the bulls for the other had not yet attained his growth was a noble animal He seemed to be a beast of prodigious strength but it was an active rather than a sluggish  strength His colour was not so white as the rest of the group His shoulders and sides had a yellowish tinge which we thought became him till our guide informed us that it was not his natural hue but that he had been rubbing himself upon some okery ground in the park This intelligence immediately turned the beauty into a defect Such is our love for nature that when we find any thing artificial which we supposed was natural we are disgusted and cannot bring the eye to it again with pleasure For tho the object in it's artificial disguise may be  in itself  more beautiful yet we cannot persuade ourselves but that nature  undisguised  would be more  uniform  and of course more pleasing Thus in the object before us tho the tinted shoulders of the bull were beautiful yet when we knew the tint was artificial the eye immediately revolted and we conceived that if it had been removed we should have seen still greater beautythe beauty at least of uniformity Thus too tho the cheek of a lady when skilfully painted may appear more beautiful while we are ignorant of the artifice yet when we are assured it is painted we take offenceeither because on closer inspection we  conceive a cheek so glowing not perfectly in unison with the other features on which time may have made an impression or be∣cause we conceive the bloom to be a disguise to some defect which the prying imagination endeavours to see through  The wild cattle we were examining are as much in a state of nature as the boun∣daries of an extensive park will admit They are at least subject to no controul Domestic use of no kind is made of them and when killed they are shot like wild beasts from trees For if they should happen only to be wounded they are dangerous Otherwise they molest nobody who does not molest them but the cows if you offer to touch their calves are fiercer than the bulls  Naturalists give a uniform colour to all animals in a state of nature and inform us that domestication induces variety In cows we may suppose therefore the original colour to be white or a tint so near it as to be called white Aeneas found white cattle in Italy and admiral Anson in Tinian Buffon  indeed supposes the yellowish dun to be the original colour But whether white or yel∣low be the original colour it is certain that white has ever been most in esteem When a bull or a heifer was led up to the altar of the Gods it was generally white and when described by the poets as peculiarly beautiful this hue is always given it The venerable Apis himself was white  For myself with regard to the  picturesque beauty  of white cattle I should make a dis∣tinction As the  ornament of a scene  I think no cattle so beautiful No sight of the kind ever exceeded that of the herd which gave occasion to these remarks At the same time when we consider the bull as a  single object  a dark colour melting into a lighter is more picturesque and of all colours Buffon's yel∣lowish dun if the head and shoulders be dark is the most beautiful  Among the pleasing scenes of Drumlanrig one is of so peculiar a nature that it should never be forgotten It consists in the un∣common appearance of comfort and happi∣ness  which reigns every where among the duke's tenants Contrary to the usual prac∣tice of the Scotch nobility the duke of Queens∣berry  The duke of Queensberry here spoken of was the last duke  grants leases of his farms and has built comfortable houses for his tenants through his whole estate Many of them are ranged within sight of his castle at pro∣per distances along the sides of the hills If they are not picturesque they have a much higher species of beauty and adorn a coun∣try more than the most admired monuments of taste Mr Maxwell the duke's steward who presides over all these improvements seems to have the interest of the lord and tenant equally at heart He talks of the munificence of the one and of the happiness of the other with the same pleasure The Queensberryestate he told us had in nine years yielded about seventy thousand pounds out of which sum the duke had only drawn for his own private use as he was at∣tached to his seat at Amesbury about thirty thousand pounds All the rest was spent in the country on works of charity gene∣rosity  improvement or of public utility Among the latter he had lately expended a large sum upon a noble road which winds some miles down the side of a mountain not far from his castle We had reason to bless his bounty on this occasion We travelled it with great ease in the night tho in many parts it is very steep We saw the old road the next day full of cataracts like the bed of a mountain torrent  Near Drumlanrig stands Queensberryhill which probably took it's name from some ancient tradition From this hill the dukes of Queensberry take their title and from the sides of it arise those springs which are the principal sources of the river Clyde  On another hill in sight of the house remain still the vestiges of Tieber's castle originally a Roman station and long after∣wards a fortress of considerable strength In the history of the wars between England and Scotland it is said to have been one of Edward's strong holds and to have been  taken from him by Wallace We have seen several of that hero's retreats in the times of distress but here he appeared in force and kept in awe by the terror of his sudden incursions the neighbouring chiefs who were inclined to Edward  A little to the left of Tieber's castle arises Entrekin a hill chiefly famous for a frightful road passing over it called by way of emi∣nence the  path of Entrekin  SECT XXX  FROM Drumlanrig to Dumfries the road is rather pleasant than picturesque The  grand style  of landscape is now gone the blue mountains of the highlands are sunk below the horizon and the country in general is flat and uniform  A little before we reach Dumfries we meet with an object which detained us some timethe ruins of Lincloudencollege It appears to have been formerly a foundation of some consequence The habitable part may still be traced contiguous to which are a chapel a hall and other appendages of a college The remains of the chapel and hall are of elegant Gothic and the whole is so combined as to afford two or three  good views The roof of the chapel is vault∣ed and still remains entire  Lincloudencollege was once a house of Benedictine nuns but those ladies growing licentious Archibald the Grim earl of Dou∣glas disfranchised them and endowed a col∣legiate house in their room When the house of Douglas was in the plenitude of it's power the kings of Scotland were little considered in these parts At Douglascastle conventions were called troops were raised and every act of regal authority was exercised The earl of Douglas therefore by his own arbitrary power altered the form of this religious house Archibald the Grim conveys to us the idea of a savage despot But his character was very different  Grim  in the Scotch language signifies  black  And Archibald was in fact an upright religious man with black hair and eyebrowsIn Lincloudencollege is a rich tomb erected to the memory of Margaret daughter of Robert the third of Scotland who married the son of Archibald the Grim  Dumfries stands pleasantly upon the Nith The water and scenery about the bridge is amusing Upon Corbellyhill which is just beyond the river we have a pleasing  view of it's winding course towards Solwayfrith  On the confines of England and Scotland the antiquarian easily collects vestiges enough of borderfeuds to fill his volume There is scarce a bridge or a pass that has not been gallantly attacked and defendednor a house of any antiquity that has not been plundered or besieged But there is one work of which considerable traces remain of more than ordinary consequence that great fosse thrown up formerly at this place to prevent the incursions of the English known at this day by the name of  Warder's dyke  Here a watch being constantly placed signals were given by beacons on the approach of an enemy and the whole country was in∣stantly alarmed The alarmcry was  a Lore∣burn a Loreburn  which words tho not now understood are inscribed as a motto on the provost's staff of office and by a wellimagined device transfer the idea of vigi∣lance from the soldier to the magistrate  At Dumfries we breakfasted with Mr Goldie with whom one of our party was well acquainted Of the recovery of this gentleman from a lethargy we heard afterwards a very astonishing account He was a large corpulent man and the disorder under which he had long laboured had at length gained so much upon him that he would fall asleep at his meals with a knife and fork in his hands His death indeed was almost daily apprehended The fatal moment as it ap∣peared at length arrived A fit of apoplexy bereft him of his senses and of every symptom of life A physician attended and for the satisfaction of his friends applied those reme∣dies which are considered commonly as the apparatus only of death They produced no apparent effect and his relations having taken their last leave of him retired Two servants sat by him one of whom was em∣ployed in supporting his dying master's head The man continued about two hours in the same posture and supposing it now a useless office he complained of the fatigue and told his fellow servant he could not well continue it longer The dying man almost instantly recovering with all his senses about  him and having heard what his servant had said dismissed him from his office and from that moment not only the effects of his apo∣plectic fit but of his lethargic disorder were intirely removed He supped with his family that evening in perfect health and was as much a man of business afterwards as he had ever been in any part of his life before nor had he ever again the least symptom either of lethargy or apoplexy He died about five years after this event at the age of sixtyeight of a total decline of strength with some dropsical appearances but with his senses perfectly clear It was about a quarter of a year before his death when we breakfasted with him and it did not then appear that he had ever had any ailment  We had this account from Dr Carlyle of Carlisle and have had it since been authenticated by Dr Gilchrist of Dumfries    As we leave Dumfries a wide bleak unpleasant country opens before us But as we approach the frith our views become rather more picturesque There is something pleasing in those long stretches of sand distant  country and water which flat shores exhibit The parts are often large welltinted and wellcontrasted Often too their various sur∣faces appear ambiguous and are melted to∣gether by light mists into one mass They are beautiful in that ambiguity as they are also when the vapours vanishing a gleam of sun∣shine breaks out and shoots over them in lengthened gleams To make pictures of them in either case the foreground must be adorned with objectsmasts of ships figures cattle or other proper appendages to break the lines of distance  A landscape of this kind we had where the Nith joins the Solway It consists of a vast stretch of country rendered dubious by distance and broken into ample parts as it approaches the eye  We had the same kind of view also towards Newbaycastle which belongs to the marquiss of Annandale and appears from the distance where we stood like the castle of desolation overlooking the barren shores of the frith  A little to the west we were informed the coast becomes more beautiful It is there  washed by the sea and tho the shores of an estuary may have their mode of beauty yet it is always inferior to the bold headlands the rocky promontories and winding bays of the ocean  One scene on this coast was particularly mentioned to us as worth visitingthe seat of the earl of Selkirkon the account of it's singularity and beauty I shall just give the outlines of it as I heard them described  Where the coast runs almost directly oppo∣site to the south a bay enters it of considerable circumference The entrance is narrrow and occupied by an island which forms the whole into a grand lake The ground which circles it is high but rather hilly than mountainous Some parts of it are rocky other parts lord Selkirk has planted  At the bottom of the bay a peninsula containing only a few acres runs into it which is sometimes tho rarely when the tides are high formed into an island On this peninsula stands lord Selkirk's house It was formerly an abbey and enjoyed the same kind of situation which the abbey of  Torbay in Devonshire did Only the abbey of Torbay stood more within the land From the abbey which stood formerly here this place obtained the name of St Mary's isle which it still retains  Situations of this kind are often very pleasing but the beauty of them depends chiefly on the grounds which inviron the water How these are shaped I know not but if their forms be analogous to those we chiefly met with along the bays or lochs of the western coast of Scotland they cannot be unpleasing One beauty I should suppose they must enjoy As the bay opens to the south one of it's sides must be inlightened by the morn∣ing and the other by the evening sun and the veering of the lights must necessarily occa∣sion if the skreens be well broken a great variety of beautiful illumination  On the western side of Saint Mary's isle a small creek runs up and forms the harbour of Kirkudbright This town tho of no extensive trade employs coasting vessels enough to people the bay with shipping which is a great advantage to it in a picturesque light  Of this town the noted refugee Paul Jones was a native Having been prosecuted for some offence he fled from home and being an active seaman obtained the command of a privateer in the American service As he knew well the parts about his native town he executed one of his first enterprizes at this place Early one morning he stood into the bay with colours flying like a British frigate and sent his boat on shore near lord Selkirk's house wellmanned with an officer who had orders to behave as if he commanded a press∣gang The scheme took effect All the men about the house and grounds imme∣diately disappeared When all was clear the officer with his party surrounded the house and inquired for lord Selkirk He was not at home Lady Selkirk was then inquired for The officer behaved very civilly but told her plainly that his errand was to carry off the familyservice of plate She assured him he had been misinformed and that lord Sel∣kirk had no service of plate With great presence of mind she then called for the but∣ler's inventory and convinced him on the spot of his mistake At the same time she or∣dered wine The officer drank her health  politely and laying his hands on what plate he met with went off without doing any wanton mischiefThis paltry piece of de∣predation was the first thing that lessened Paul Jones in the esteem of his brotherofficers who afterwards saw more into his character and felt great reluctance at serving with a fellow however daring and enter∣prizing so low illiberal and unprincipled  Besides the scenery about St Mary's isle we were told of other parts of the coast still more to the west which were well worth visiting But our time not allowing us to go in quest of them we continued our rout to England  As we approach the frith still nearer it becomes narrower and the opposite shores of England begin now to take a form in the distance The principal features are the high woody grounds about Bolness and the moun∣tains of Cumberland among which Skiddaw is conspicuous  Gretnagreen was the last place we visited in Scotland the great resort of such unfor∣tunate nymphs as differ with their parents and guardians on the subject of marriage It is not a disagreeable scene The village is concealed by a grove of trees which occupy a gentle rise at the end of which stands the church and the picture is finished with two distances one of which is very remote  Particular places furnish their peculiar to∣pics of conversation At Dover the great gate of England towards France the vulgar topic is the landing and embarking of fo∣reigners their names titles and retinue and a general civility toward them reigns both in manners and language  Travel a few miles to the west and at Portsmouth you will find a new topic of conversation There all civility to our po∣lite neighbours is gone and people talk of nothing but ships cannon gunpowder and in the boisterous language of the place blowing the French to the d  Here the subject of conversation is totally changed The only topics are the stratagems  of lovers the tricks of servants and the deceits put upon parents and guardians  Vetuere patres quod non potuere vetare  is the motto of the place  Of all the seminaries in Europe this is the seat where that species of literature called novelwriting may be the most suc∣cessfully studied A few months conversation with the literati of this place will furnish the inquisitive student with such a fund of anecdotes that with a moderate share of ima∣gination in tacking them together he may spin out as many volumes as he pleases In his hands may shine the delicacy of that nymph and an apology for her conduct who unsupported by a father unattended by a sis∣ter boldly throws herself into the arms of some adventurer flies in the face of every thing that bears the name of decorum en∣dures the illiberal laugh and jest of a whole country through which she runs mixes in the shocking scenes of this vile place where every thing that is low indelicate and abo∣minable presides no Loves and Graces to hold the nuptial torch or lead the hymeneal  dance an inn the temple and an innkeeper the priest and suffers her name to be in∣rolled I had almost said in the records of prostitutionThese were perhaps the na∣tural effects of an act of legislature which many thought was conducted on less liberal principles than might have been wished  Leaving these Idalian scenes we soon met the Sark which is the limit of Scotland in this part The ground is well varied and the bridge and river with the addition of a few trees to cover the real nakedness of the scene would make a tolerable picture  As we enter England we have a grand distance on the right The nearer parts of it present the river Eden uniting with Sol∣wayfrith Beyond these rises the city of Carlisle distinguished by it's castle and ca∣thedral and beyond all a range of moun∣tains  The road led us close by the place where that dreadful eruption from Solwaymoss in the year entered the Esk Time has now almost effaced the scars which that ter∣rible mischief made in it's career A great part of the plain which was once overflowed is now recovered but we were informed it had been cleared at an expence nearly equal to the value of the land  It may not be amiss on the conclusion of this tour in Scotland which we were obliged to perform for want of time in little more than a fortnight to recapitulate a few of those peculiarities and striking modes of scenery which this wild country exhibits A general view of this kind will impress more strongly the idea of the scenes we have passedTo the observations also which have immediately arisen from such a view may be added a few other particulars which we had not an op∣portunity of introducing before  SECT XXXI  ON entering Scotland what makes the first impression on the picturesque eye are those vast tracts of land which we meet with in∣tirely  in a state of nature  I speak not here of mountains or vallies or any  particular species  of country but of those large tracts of  every  species which are totally untouched by art In many parts of England in Der∣byshire particularly and the more northern counties we see vast districts of these wild scenes but still they are generally intersected by the boundaries of property consisting chiefly of loose stone walls which run along the wastes and sides of mountains and as∣cend often to their summits There cannot be a greater deformity in landscape These rectilineal figures break the great flowing lines of nature and injure her features like those  whimsical scratches and pricked lines which we sometimes see on the faces of Indians But in Scotland at least in those parts which we visited we rarely met with any of these intersections All is unbounded This it is true is not so much a beauty as the re∣moval of a deformity but when deformi∣ties are removed beauty in some shape ge∣nerally makes it's appearance It is art that sophisticates nature We consider cloathing as necessary and some modes of it as pic∣turesque but still it hides the forms of nature which are undoubtedly more beau∣tiful so that beauty gives way to decency and convenienceIt is thus in landscape Ceres Triptolemus and all the worthies who introduced corn and tillage deserve un∣questionably the thanks of mankind Far be it from me to disturb their statues or erase their inscriptions But we must at the same time acknowledge that they have miserably scratched and injured the face of the globe Wherever man appears with his tools defor∣mity follows his steps His spade and his plough his hedge and his furrow make shocking enchroachments on the simplicity and elegance of landscape The old acornseason  was unquestionably the reign of picturesque beauty when nature planted her own woods and laid out her own lawns  immunis rastroque intacta nec ullis  Saucia vomeribus  Could we see her in her native attire what delightful scenery should we have Tho we might now and then wish to remove a redundance for she is infinitely exuberant in all her operations yet the noble style in which she works the grandeur of her ideas and the variety and wildness of her compo∣sition could not fail to rouse the imagination and inspire us with infinite delight  And yet we must make a distinction among countries in the state of nature Vast exten∣sive flat countries tho covered with wood like many of the maritime parts of America cannot possess much beauty Seen from the sea they are mere woody lines and examined in their internal parts the eye is every where confined and can see only the trees that circumscribe it The only countries which are picturesque in a state of nature are such as consist of variety both of  soil  and  ground  You must have  variety of soil  that some parts may be covered with wood and others with  heath or pasturage You must have variety of  ground  that you may view the several parts of the country with advantage Rivers also and lakes both belong to a state of nature In this way the face of England is varied and would certainly on the whole be more beautiful in a state of nature than in a state of cultivation Scotland and Ireland are both countries of this kind Such also are Swit∣zerland Italy many parts of Germany and I suppose in general most of the northern and eastern parts of Europe  In the casual observations of travellers we have many pleasing sketches of landscape in a state of nature from countries still more remote and less known  The kingdom of Whydah particularly on the coast of Guinea is represented as one of the most delightful countries in the world It abounds every where with a great variety of beautiful trees which grow in groves and clumps without any underwood or even weeds and the ground is spread in rich pastures and meadows winding among them without any separation or boundaries but what are occasioned by the folding and in∣termixing of these natural groves  The same kind of scenery is described in admiral Anson's voyage in the island of Tinian There the country we are told has the air of a magnificent plantation in which extensive lawns and stately woods are artfully combined and judiciously adapted to the declivities of the hills and the inequalities of the ground which rises in gentle slopes from the beach to the middle part of the island tho the general course of it's ascent is often interrupted by woody vallies which wind irregularly through the country  Such exhibitions as these however are among the choicest of nature's productions We are not to expect such scenes every where And even in these picturesque countries themselves the eye will often be repelled by deformities yet almost every where we may expect from pure nature something either of grandeur or beauty to amuse us Even in countries like this in which we now travelled where the soil and climate deny the luxuriant growth of wood there is abundant amusement  quae deserta et imhospita tesqua  Credis amoena vocat mecum qui sentit  The coarsest face of nature is a comely face and tho her features in these barren countries have no great share of sweetness and beauty yet there is always something wildly graceful and expressive in her countenance  SECT XXXII  A  Poverty of landscape  from a want of ob∣jects particularly of wood is another striking characteristic in the views of Scotland A country as we have seen under the last head may be in a state of nature and yet exceedingly rich The various hues which woody scenes exhibit the breaks which they occasion and the catches of light which they receive are abundant sources of what we call  richness  in landscape In populous countries the various kinds of architecture bridges aqueducts towns towers and above all the ruins of castles and abbeys add great rich∣ness to the scenes of nature and in  remote  distances even  cultivation  has it's use Cornfields fallows and hedgerows melted to∣gether with other objects we have often had  occasion to observe form one general rich mass  Now in all these sources both of  natural  and  artificial richness  we find the Scotch land∣scape every where greatly deficient  In the  foregrounds  indeed this  poverty of landscape  is of little importance Here the painter must necessarily take some liberty in his views of the  richest  country It is rarely that he can form his composition without it and in Scotland he has as good a chance as any where of meeting with broken knolls ragged rocks or pieces of winding road to give him a general hint for his foreground which is all that he desires But in the several  removes of country  the Scotch landscape is not so happy In  these  it's poverty chiefly appears In most parts of England the views are rich Near the capital especially objects are scattered in such profusion that unless the distance be very remote they are injurious to landscape by distracting the eye But the  Scotch distance  rarely exhibits any diversity of objects It is in general a barren tract of the same  uniform unbroken hue  fatiguing the eye for want of variety and giving the imagina∣tion little scope for the amusement which it  often finds amid the ambiguity of remote objectsWere it not for this general defi∣ciency of objects particularly of wood in the Scotch views I have no doubt but they would rival those of Italy Many a castle Gandolfo might we have seated on an emi∣nence and overlooking an Alban lake and a rich circumjacent country The grand outlines are all laid in a little finishing is all we want  Dr Johnson has given us a picture of Scotch landscape painted I am sorry to say by the hand of peevishness It presents us with all it's defects but none of it's beauties  "The hills says he are almost totally covered with dark heath and even that ap∣pears checked in it's growth What is not heath is nakedness a little diversified now and then by a stream rushing down the steep An eye accustomed to flowery pastures and waving harvests is astonished and repelled by this wide extent of hopeless sterility The appearance is that of matter incapable of form or usefulness dismissed by nature from her care disinherited of her favours and  left in it's original elemental state or quick∣ened only with one sullen power of useless vegetation  West isles p  "  How much more just and goodnatured is the remark of another able writer on this subject "We are agreeably struck with the grandeur and magnificence of nature in her wildest formswith the prospect of vast and stupendous mountains but is there any ne∣cessity for our attending at the same time to the bleakness the coldness and the bar∣renness which are universally connected with them  See Gregory's comparative view c p  "  It is true indeed that an eye like Dr Johnson's which is accustomed to see the beauties of landscape  only  in  flowery pastures and waving harvests  cannot be attracted by the great and sublime in nature It will bring every thing to it's own model and measure the proportions of a giant by the limbs of a dwarf Dr Johnson says the Scotch mountain has the appearance of matter  incapable of form or usefulness  As for it's  usefulness  it may for any thing he can know  have as much use in the system of nature as  flowery pastures and waving harvests  See Derham's Physi  theology Book III chap in which the great usefulness of mountains is examined  And as for it's being  incapable of form  he can mean only that it cannot be formed into cornfields and meadows It's form as a mountain is unquestionably grand and sublime in the highest degree For that poverty in objects or  simplicity  as it may be called which no doubt injures the beauty of a Scotch landscape is certainly at the same time the  source of sublimity  Simplicity  and  variety  are the acknowledged foundations of all picturesque effect Either of them will produce it but it generally takes it's tone from one  Since this was written I met the same remark in Mr Shenstone's thoughts on gardening Tho our opinions are not in all points coincident they are wholly so in this "Grandeur and beauty says he are so very opposite that you often diminish the one as you increase the other Variety is most akin to the latter simplicity to the former Suppose a large hill varied by art with large patches of differentcoloured clumps scars of rocks chalkquarries villages or farmhouses you will have perhaps a more beautiful scene but much less grand than it was before"  When the land∣scape  approaches nearer  simplicity  it approaches nearer the  sublime  and when  variety  prevails it tends more to the  beautiful  A vast range of mountains the lines of which are simple and the surfaces broad grand and extensive is rather  sublime  than  beautiful  Add trees upon the foreground tufted woods creeping up the sides of the hills a castle upon some knoll and skiffs upon the lake if there be one and tho the landscape will still be  sublime  yet with these additions if they are happily introduced the  beautiful  will predominateThis is exactly the case of the Scotch views The addition of such furniture would give them  beauty  At present unadorned grandeur is their cha∣racteristic and the production of  sublime ideas  the effect  Yet such views are by no means void of the picturesque Their broken lines and sur∣faces mix variety enough with their simplicity to make them often noble subjects of painting tho as we have observed they are less ac∣commodated to drawing Indeed these wild scenes of sublimity unadorned even by a single tree form in themselves a very  grand species of landscape  It should not however be inferred that Scotland is without wood Dr Johnson's remarks  See Johnson's tour  on this subject are too acrimonious It is true we meet with no ancient forests and rarely with a single oak elm or beech of dignity enough to adorn a foreground In∣deed we rarely except around the seats of the nobility find any extent of deciduous woods tho of inferior growth That beautiful species of landscape which is so common in England under the denomination of parkscenery is little known in Scotland But we met with many a plantation of pine many a  plaga pinea montis  mountains covered with fir which when fully grown and their uniformity a little destroyed by the axe may hereafter have a fine effect At present we saw few extensive plantations that had attained any state of picturesque perfection In smaller plots we found several that had But till lately I believe the Scotch nobility and gentry have not employed them∣selves much in planting  The Scotch fir which generally makes a distinguished part of these plantations is na∣turally a beautiful tree A strait regular stem is not the form which nature gives it Left to itself it's bole often takes an elegant turn and it's branches an irregular form It's growth is not very unlike that of the stone pine which is among the most picturesque trees It graces the views of Italy and is one of the greatest ornaments of the ruins of Rome In England we scarce know it But when the Scotch fir is left to it's natural growth it frequently resembles this species of pine As it attains age it's head forms a bushy clump and yet I know not whe∣ther it is so happy in this respect in it's native country as when it is favoured in England with a richer soil and happier cli∣mate  Besides the Scotch fir the spruce seems also a native of this country at least it flou∣rishes here very happily This tree has more than any other what in the language of poetry hath been called  the shadowy pomp of floating foliage  and in many situations nothing combines better with other trees It is often also as a single tree an object of great beauty  spiring in a pyramidal form and yet vary∣ing it's lateral branches so as to remove every unpleasant idea of uniformity and when it receives the sun it's little broken parts splen∣did with light and hanging against the dark recesses in the body of the tree have a fine effect I am at present however considering these trees not as  individuals  but as they may in some places by adorning barren parts aid that poverty of landscape which is in general so prevalent in Scotland  In these services tho we meet the  pinerace  seldomer than we wish we find the  deciduous  tree still a greater stranger in the country Here and there we see the larch and the birch both of which flourish and both of which are picturesque But tho the nobler trees as we observed occur rarely yet when we see them thrive in many parts particu∣larly about Dunkeld Inverary Taymouth Hamilton and Hopetonhouse we cannot but suppose the country is in general as well adapted to foster them as the pine and that the nakedness of Scotland in this respect is more owing to the inattention of the lords of the soil than to any  thing forbidding either in the soil itself or in the climate  After all however I know not whether the pinerace are not in a  picturesque light  more adapted to the  ruggedness  of the coun∣try than the deciduous tree which is more suited to the  sylvan  scene  Besides in Scotland winter reigns three parts of the year The oak protrudes it's foliage late and is early disrobed The pine is certainly a more cheerful and a more shel∣tering winterplant and of course not only better adapted to the  scene  but to the  climate  also  Of pines no doubt very large plantations might every where be extended Many of the summits of mountains are indeed intrac∣table and must be left in their native un∣adorned grandeur but along the whole dis∣trict through which we travelled as far as we could judge from particular spots and yet these not particularly favoured a very large proportion of the country might bear wood and Scotland might again be what we have reason to believe it once was full of forests and woody scenes  SECT XXXIII  WOOD however if it existed could never be the glory of Scotch land∣scape It's mountains lakes and rivers are it's pride  It's mountains are so various that they appear in every shape which a mountain can assume at least in every picturesque shape for what is very extraordinary among so large a collection of mountains we meet with very few grotesque or unpleasing forms A gene∣ral elegance runs through their lines and intersections and we found among them what we do not commonly find not only grand objects but agreeable composition so true is the poet's remark that in the wild scenes of Nature there is sometimes  an art  Or seeming art which by position apt  Arranges shapes unequal so to save  That correspondent poize which unpreserved  Would mock our gaze with airy vacancy  A mountain is of use sometimes to close a distance by an elegant varied line and some∣times to come in as a second ground hanging over a lake or forming a skreen to the nearer objects To each purpose the Scotch mountains are well adapted The distances of this country with all their uniformity have at least one praise as we have often had occasion to observe that of being bound∣ed by a grand chain of blue mountains and when these mountains approach their shapes are generally such as may with little alteration be transferred to canvas  I have however heard good judges in land∣scape find much fault with the Scotch moun∣tains in general and place them on the wrong side of a comparison with the mountains of Italy and other countries I can only there∣fore give my own opinion modestly on this head suggesting at the same time that perhaps these travellers and I may have drawn our conclusions from different parts of the country Those mountains which I have remarked I  have generally specified in the course of my journeyOr it may be perhaps that these travellers admire mountains with spiry tops instead of flowing lines which with me are not among objects of picturesque beauty  The lakes of Scotland are as various as it's mountains but they partake with them of the barrenness of the country In the neighbourhood of water one should expect something more of vegetation In gene∣ral however the Scotch lakes are very lit∣tle adorned You see fine sweeping lines bays recesses islands castles and mountainskreens all of which except the castles are in the best style But with these embellish∣ments you must be content wood you sel∣dom find at least in any degree of richness or proportionAt the same time if you wish to  study landscape  perhaps you can no where study it with more advantage For scenes like these are the schools in which  the elements  of landscape are taughtthose great outlines without understanding which the art of finishing is frippery  One thing farther may be observed with regard to the lakes of Scotland and that is their dingy colour The lakes of Cumber∣land and Westmoreland have a remarkable pellucidity They are so transparent as to admit the sight many fathoms below the sur∣face whereas all the Scotch lakes which we saw take a mossy tinge from the moors probably in their neighbourhood at least they were all I think of that hue when we saw them And yet I know not whether this tinge is of any great disadvantage to them It certainly affects the  general landscape  very little In navigating the lake indeed or in viewing it's surface from the bank it pre∣sents an unpleasant hue and perhaps the reflections are not so vivid as when the mir∣ror is brighter Yet I have sometimes thought this dinginess is perhaps more in harmony with the moorish lands which generally form the Scotch landscape than if the hue of the water had been more resplendent  The rivers in Scotland are in general very beautiful They are all mountainstreams and their channels as we have seen in the course  of this journey commonly fretted in rock Their descent of course is rapid and bro∣ken They are true classical rivers  Decursu rapido de montibus altis  Dant sonitum spumosi  Their banks we allow are seldom wooded of∣ten indeed without the least fringe but when they are fortunate enough to find accompani∣ments of this kind as they sometimes do they form scenes which perhaps no other coun∣try can boast Among their beauties are their frequent cascades which are generally of the broken kind Sheets of water we rarely found Their common properties are admirably described in the following lines of a Scotch bard  Burn's poems p    Whyles  Whyles  sometimes  owre a lynn  a  linn  a cascade  the burnie  burnie  a brook  plays  Or through the glen it wimpled  wimples  winds    Whyles round a rocky scar it strays  Whyles in a wiel  a  wiel  a little whirlpool  it dimpled  Whyles glittered to the nightly rays  Wi' bickering  bickering  hasty  dancing dazzle  Whyles cookit underneath the braes  cookit underneath the braes  appears and disappears under the hills    Below the spreading hazle  The estuaries of the Scotch rivers exceed any that are to be seen in England In England their shores are generally low and tame even the Welch mountains give little grandeur to the Severn But in Scotland the friths of the Clyde and Forth LochFyn LochLoung and many others display the noblest and most beautiful scenery The English estuary besides the flatness of it's shores is often too wide The water gets out of proportion which it always does if it extend more than a mile or a mile and a half in breadth The Severn and the Hum∣ber are both of this kind Nor is the Sol∣wayfrith much better it partakes too much of the tameness and disproportion of the Eng∣lish estuary But the Scotch estuaries having their boundaries generally marked by the firmer barriers of mountains are kept within narrower limits and rarely exceed a proper width unless just at their mouths and even then the height of the mountains is generally such as to preserve a tolerable proportion between the land and the water  One circumstance farther may be mentioned and that is the gloomy melancholy air which commonly overspreads the Scotch landscape I mean the highland part of it which I have been describing "The highlands of Scot∣land says Dr Beattie form a picturesque but in general a melancholy country Long tracts of mountainous desert covered with dark heath and often obscured by misty weather narrow vallies thinly inhabited and bounded by precipices resounding with the fall of tor∣rents the mournful dashing of waves along the friths and lakes that intersect the coun∣try and the portentous noises which every change of the wind and every increase and diminution of the waters is apt to raise in a lonely region full of rocks caverns and echoes" are all circumstances of a melancholy cast and tho they are not entirely of the picturesque kind yet they are nearly allied to it and give a tinge to the imagination of every traveller who examines these scenes of solitude and grandeur  SECT XXXIV  AMONG the picturesque appendages of this wild country we may consider the flocks and herds which frequent them Here we have stronger ideas than any other part of the island presents of that primeval state when man and beast were joint tenants of the plain The highlander and his cattle seem entirely to have this social connection They lead their whole lives together and in their diet beverage and habitation discover less dif∣ference than is found between the higher and lower members of any luxurious state  These  groups of cattle  were picturesque wherever we found them tho we found them less frequently than we could have expected in a country which is totally pasturage for altho the district be wide the herbage is scanty The animals therefore unable to feed  every where gregariously as nature inclines them are obliged to ramble apart and pick up a subsistence where they can  The cattle themselves as  individuals  are in general homely Their colour is commonly black with patches of white which make together the most inharmonious of all mix∣tures They are small their countenances usually sour and their horns widevery un∣like the small curled beautiful horn of the Alderney and French cow But these de∣formities are of little consequence in  a group  The sheep are also diminutive and ordinary but in their tattered rough attire exceedingly picturesqueThese scenes too are often en∣livened by a species of little wild horses which tho not absolutely in a state of nature are perfectly  sui juris  for the first three or four years of their lives Some of these how∣ever are very beautiful  Nor are the cattle of this wild country more picturesque than it's human inhabitants The highland dress which notwithstanding  an act of parliament is still in general use  As the highlanders were so extravagantly attached to their dress the government in the year in some degree re∣stored it to general use But it is by no means universally adopted The herdsman of the mountains finds it beyond all others convenient but the farmer who has a settled abode begins to think the English dress more commodious  is greatly more ornamental than the English I speak of it's form not it's colour which is checked of different hues and has a disagreeable appearance The plaid consists of a simple piece of cloth three yards in length and half that measure in breadth A common one sells for about ten shillings The highlander wears it in two forms In fine weather he throws it loosely round him and the greater part of it hangs over his shoulder In rain he wraps the whole close to his body In both forms it makes elegant drapery and when he is armed with his pistols and Ferrara  Andrew Ferrara a Spaniard was invited into Scotland by James the third to teach his countrymen the art of tempering steel From him the best broadswords take their name  has a good effect Oftener than once we amused ourselves with desiring some highlander whom we accidentally met to perform the exercise of his plaid by chang∣ing  it from one form to the other Trifling as the operation seems it would puzzle any man who had not been long used to it But to see the plaid in perfection you must see the highland gentleman on horseback Such a figure carries you into Roman times and presents you with the idea of Marcus Aurelius  Alluding to the antique  If the bonnet were laid aside for the elegance of which but little can be said the drapery is very nearly Roman The bonnet is commonly made in the form of a beefeater's cap which is very ugly I have sometimes however seen the bonnet sit snugger to the head and adorned with a plume of feathers It is then extremely picturesque When the common people take a journey on horseback they often gather up the plaid in a few plaits and so form it into a cloak In this shape it is scanty and unpicturesque  What little change three centuries have made in the dress and accoutrements of a highlander will appear from the following account written in the time of Henry the seventh  "Alteram aquilonarem ac montosam tenet genus hominum longe durissimum ac asperum qui sylvestres dicuntur Hi sago et interiore tunica amiciuntur nudisque genu tenus tibiis incedunt Arma sunt arcus et sagittae cum ense admodum lato et pugione unâ tantum ex parte acuto  Pol Virg lib I p  "If we take away his bow and arrows and stick a couple of pistols in his belt the highlander of those days is the very highlander of these  SECT XXXV  IN point of all improvements in landscape and every exertion of taste the Scotch are very far behind their more southern neigh∣bours Few ideas of this kind of beauty have yet seized them The lawn the clump and the winding walk which carries you simply to every thing worth seeing in the neighbourhood are rarely found The mo∣dern river indeed I should not recommed to their imitation It is generally a poor unnatural contrivance One genuine Scotch torrent is fairly worth all the serpentine rivers in Eng∣landIt is true the Scotch landscape boasts of nobler effects than these trivial services of art can produce but even the grand scenery of nature may sometimes be improved by the addition of a good foreground and about the houses of the nobility where improvement is  avowedly aimed at the efforts are generally either feeble absurd puerile or grotesque But a national taste is long in forming At the beginning of Henry the second Gothic architecture first appeared but it did not arrive at perfection till about the reign of Henry the sixth which was nearly three centuries afterwardsThus too the Grecian and Roman architecture which began to appear in Eng∣land in the days of Henry the eighth was long a heterogeneous compound and has not yet perhaps attained it's perfect growth  About the beginning of this century appeared first the dawning of the present taste in im∣proving gardens and pleasure grounds which is in fact nothing more than a simple endeavour to improve nature by herself to collect ideas of the most beautiful scenery and to adapt them to different situations preserving at the same time the natural character of each scene But this taste simple easy and natural as it appears is yet by no means become general even in England The old idea that  art must do something more than nature  is not yet obliterated and we see the grotesque the  formal and the fantastic still holding posses∣sion in many scenes where we might have expected simplicity and nature But the Scotch are still at least half a century behind the English In Scotland we saw nothing in this way purely elegant Even in their best improvements there is a mixture of the old insipidity It must be understood however that I speak of things as I found them a dozen years ago Many improvements may by this time be introduced I have already mentioned the improvements which I am informed have been made around Hamiltonhouse and it is probable there may be many other It will be long however before this taste can become general  With regard to architecture painting and statuary very little is found in Scotland to detain a traveller The duke of Athol's gar∣dens are at this day    adorned with tawdry painted leaden figures the product of Hidepark corner  Before I conclude these remarks it may be necessary in justice to myself to suggest one consideration It is very possible that many who may travel this country may see among the natural objects of it many which have escaped my eye and lose others which mine observed Objects too may appear under very different forms to different per∣sons All this will necessarily happen from the different circumstances under which they are seen A grand light or shade thrown upon an object gives it a consequence with∣out which it may escape notice One traveller seeing an offskip under the circumstance of a light thin mist without attending to the cause cries out What a beautiful distance Another travelling the same road an hour afterwards finds the distance gone and in it's room an unpleasant black heath At one time a distance might appear melting into the horizon at another a lurid cloud might have taken possession of the sky above it and the distance assuming it's indigo tinge might be marked with a harsh blue edge To my eye as the sun declined a part of Dunbartonrock  appeared from the shores of Lochlo∣mond like a vast tent with one of the frontcurtains drawn back To another person travelling in a morning it would probably make an appearance totally different I have touched on this subject in another work  See the preface to the North tour p  and may add that in a mountainous coun∣try these variations are more common than any where else Such countries are greatly affected by lights shades mists and a va∣riety of other circumstances so that in point of size shape and distance two persons may give very different accounts of the same moun∣tain and yet both may be very exact  Amidst all these sources of uncertainty which by the way are sources also of variety and beauty I have generally marked the time of the day together with such circumstances as appeared singular in the view and I hope whoever should see the country which I have described under the same circumstances in which it appeared to me would find the de∣lineation of it tolerably exact  SECT XXXVI  FROM Carlisle to Cockermouth we passed over dreary unpleasant heaths Some scenery we found particularly at Cockbridge and about Whitehall an old deserted mansion belonging to the Salkelds The road to it happens to be so conducted as to form a good approach  As we mounted the hill a little beyond Bowl we had a grand view of the opening of the Solwayfrith into the Irishsea It's breadth is considerable and yet the mountain of Scrofell which takes it's station near the mouth of the frith on the Scotch side makes a very respectable appearance To the right we see the frith narrowing through the space of many leagues beyond which the mountains  of Scotland rise in the distance while the English border forms the nearer ground The whole together is too extensive for the pencil but a good view might be taken of the situation of Scrofell a Scotch mountain at the mouth of the frithThis was our last re∣trospect of a country which had afforded us so much pleasure  As we approached Cockermouth the moun∣tains which occupy the middle of Cumber∣land begin to make a formidable appearance One of them in particular enlightened by an evening sun seemed supported by vast buttresses like some mighty rampart in the times of the giant wars Each buttress I suppose might be three or four times the height of St Paul's church When nature in any of her frolicscenes takes the semblance of art how paltry in the comparison appear the labours of men At the same time in her frolicscenes she is the least picturesque  Cockermouth is one of the pleasantest towns in the north of England It lies in a sinuous  extended vale skreened by that circular chain of mountains Skiddaw and it's compeers which we have just mentioned But they do not hang over the vale they are removed to a proper distance and form a grand back∣ground to all the objects of it The vale itself is beautiful consisting of great variety of ground and more adorned with wood than the scenes of the north commonly are But it's greatest ornaments are two rivers and the ruins of a castle The rivers are the Derwent and the Cocker both rapid streams The former is the larger to which the latter is but tributary At the confluence of these rivers close by the town rises a peninsular knoll in part probably artificial Upon this stand the ruins of the castle which are among the most magnificent in England Besides the grand appearance they make on the spot they present an object in various parts of the vale and dignify some very pic∣turesque scenes  Few castles have made such ample provision for prisoners of war as this Here are two vaulted dungeons each of them capable of holding fifty men An aperture at the top of each is just sufficient to lower down the un∣happy  captive into it and his food was shovelled through a small slit at the side  It makes one shudder to think of the wretched condition of a human creature shut up in these chambers of horror How dread∣ful would it be for the people of these more polished times to be carried back into those barbarous periods when these savage practices existed And yet there is such a correspond∣ence throughout the whole system of manners in each aera that people are happier perhaps under the intire habits of any one age than they would be under a partial change even tho that change were for the better If we could ill bear a mixture with such savage contemporaries they would perhaps be as much discomposed with our polished manners Nor did they feel as we should a compassion for that barbarous treatment which they were ready to suffer themselves from the chance of war  The territory annexed to this castle by Wil∣liam the Conqueror was all that tract of country called Copeland at that time a mere forest stretching between the river Dudden and the Derwent Tradition fixes the origi∣nal seat of this little feudal empire at Papcastle  about a mile from Cockermouth and informs us that Waldoff in the age succeed∣ing the conquest deserted it as not sufficiently extensive and built the castle of Cockermouth At Papcastle no vestiges remain of any such fortress but the name and site are both strong arguments for it's having existed  We scarce remember in our whole tour a pleasanter walk than we had one evening in the meadows along the banks of the Der∣went The whole scenery is pleasant and as we returned by the higher grounds we had through the whole walk a varying view of the castle of Cockermouth which tho not the most beautiful object has at least a grandeur and dignity which make it inter∣esting in every view  From Cockermouth to Keswick which was our next stage lead two roads One of them over the mountain of Whinlater is called the  upper road  the  lower  passes by Armithwaitebridge and the lake of Bassen∣thwait Let the traveller enquire for the latter and not be deterred tho the prudent innkeeper inform him that the Whinlaterroad  is both better and nearer He will find the  lower road  very good and instead of repining at being carried two miles about he will wish he had been carried twenty at least if he is bent on no errand of importance so amply will the inconvenience be repayed by a suc∣cession of scenery in which grandeur and beauty combine to entertain him  He will first be presented with a mountainvista which he must consider as the grand portal to the scene he approaches This vista which he pursues about four miles is termi∣nated by the mountain of Skiddaw  The surface of this mountain when we saw it exemplified very strongly an incident to which these vast bodies are sometimes liable that of  false shadows  Scarce any thing gives higher offence to the picturesque eyeWhoever pretends to any skill in painting tho he may not be versed in all the theory of light yet cannot be ignorant of these general principlesthat the light falls on all the objects of a landscape in one direc∣tionthat all the shadows are of course thrown on the opposite sideand that extended shadow  is one great source of that  breadth  as the painters call it both in nature and in paint∣ing in which simplicity consists  Now on the vast surfaces of these elevated bodies it sometimes happens that in the room of this simple illumination we see what I have expressed by the term  false shadows  which are occasioned by small floating clouds inter∣cepting the light and throwing their shadows promiscuously and often where we should naturally expect light In  flat  countries these  false shadows  are rarely disgusting They are often lost in cavities they are often broken and dispersed by intervening objects they are often lengthened by perspective and so lose their dis∣agreeable form they are often also the source of great beauty by leaving catching lights upon the distant parts of a landscape or some happy illumination upon an object at hand Indeed this fortuitous circumstance is often employed by painters with great effect  See Vol I p    But when these  false shadows  are patched against the  side of a mountain  and held up  to the eye in their full size and dimensions they are almost ever accompanied with great con∣fusionA sunshiny windy day therefore with small floating clouds is the worst kind of wea∣ther for viewing a mountainous country  At the end of the vista we came to the brow of the hill called the  Ray  from whence we had a noble view The segment of a vast circle many leagues in circumference opened before the eye It was a cultivated vale skreened by Skiddaw and other mountains which winding round pushed their bases into it in different directions forming many bays and promontories of broken ground as they united with the vale In the middle a portion of the lake of Bassenthwait made an ample sweep Here beauty was introduced into our landscape and mixed with the sublime The whole valley indeed was amusing in a great degree tho too extensive to be the object of paint∣ing  From the Ray descending into the vale we had as grand a vista formed by the lake  of Bassenthwait as had been formed by the mountains just before The lake of Bassen∣thwait is not among the most beautiful lakes of the north It is about four miles long and rarely more than half a mile in breadth It seldom therefore has space enough to bear it's proportion in the noble scenes in which it is engaged especially when viewed across but as we here took it in perspective it made a noble appearance running up among the mountains and losing itself behind them Skiddaw formed the left skreen of this vista Thornthwaitcragg the right and the moun∣tains of Borrowdale filled the centre  We had another very fine view of the lake at Owsebridge where the river Derwent leaves the waters of Bassenthwait Here also we saw the lake in perspective which gives it a spreading appearance and more consequence than it commonly hasOn it's banks stands Armithwaite where we had the same view over the lake which the road had just presented to us  We now approached the northern side of Skiddaw This mountain is in most parts  smooth tame and unfurnished But on this side it makes it's best apppearance It is channelled and guttered in it's higher parts and often adorned with large proportions of rocky ground In one place it exhibits two vast basons The whole mountain seems divided into an upper and a lower region The lower spreads into sheepwalks which run as far as the guttered channels and in many parts insinuate themselves among them till all distinction of surface is lost in the heights of the mountain A greyish tint over∣spread the middle parts contending with purple as it rose higher till at length the purple gained the ascendant and took possession of all the upper regions of the mountain  This was the appearance which Skiddaw exhibited at a second distance but the road soon brought us under it's base where all it's upper regions disappeared and we could see nothing but the immensity of it's skirts  Here we were entertained with another grand mountainvista A concave part of the base of Skiddaw sweeping to the road formed the near skreen on the left on the  right was a chain of broken mountains run∣ning into perspective and the lake having now changed it's form appeared like a noble river winding under them  Our landscape too had all the advantages which light could give it After a disturbed day the evening was serene All the  false shadows  had fled with the clouds the lights were strong and permanent and under such illumination every mountain summit and every woody knoll had taken it's proper form together with it's proper hue  We still continued winding round Skiddaw the sides of which are every where rather shelving than steep But as we now began to veer round towards it's southern aspect we lost all the guttered channels and rocky promontories which invested the northern side of the mountain Smooth pasturage seemed now to cloath it to the topThe road is good every where round the mountain which con∣tinually sheds from it's skirts a kind of shi∣vering flaky stratum which binds hard and is perfectly smooth  We now came to the isthmian part which divides the two lakes of Bassenthwait and Keswick The beautiful meadows at the head of the lake full of cattle made a plea∣sing appearance contrasted as they were with rocky mountains on every side  As we approached still nearer the vale of Keswick began to open and we had a grand view of the mountains of Borrowdale arrayed in all the splendor of an eveningsun These are among the most broken of all the mountains of the north and their ragged points on a nearer approach wear rather a fantastic form but at the distance from which we now viewed them every grotesque appearance was lost and their broken points were admirably fitted to receive the sharp catches of light with which they were all illumined Below the mountains appeared the skirts of the lake of Keswick We saw the whole scene afterwards to great advantage from the higher grounds which fully com∣mand this grand and beautiful landscape  SECT XXXVII  THO we had seen the lake of Keswick many times yet such a scene is an inexhaustible fund of beauty It always pre∣sents something new Our next undertaking therefore was to ride round the lake which we had never done before It is about eleven miles in circumference Amusing however as this circuit is it seems to have been so little frequented that altho we were under the conduct of an inhabitant of the place we had some difficulty in finding even a bridleroad and yet materials are so plentiful that a little expence might easily make it commodious for wheels Were the road better the tour of the lake of Keswick would perhaps be one of the grandest and most beautiful rides in Eng∣land You are not carried along the margin of the lake which in many parts is probably  obstructed by large promontories of rock running into the water but you wind often among the higher grounds and slope along the sides of the hills The  whole lake together  you seldom see but you have every where the most beautiful views of portions of it open bays deep recesses and spreading sheets accom∣panied both in the distance and foregrounds with such variety of rock wood and broken knolls as few landscapes exhibit in so small a compass  From the eastern side of the lake which we had traversed oftener than once the west∣ern side appears waste and barren On the western side we had never been before and were surprised to find it what it did not appear at a distance full of beautiful scenery Ringsidefell which makes a part of it is a grand and well shaped mountain The other mountains between it and Bassenthwaite are too much broken  Of the islands upon the lake we had several views of Lord's island covered with wood of St Herbert's newly planted with fir and of Vicar's island flat plain and culti∣vated  In some places too we had a view of them all together  Lodoar was in great penury when we past it Instead of roaring over the mighty rocks which forms it's descent it fell gently down gliding among them with feeble tone not having force of water to resist it's obstruc∣tions  A circuit round the lake naturally suggests the visionary idea of improving it If the whole lake I mean the whole district of land and water contained within the circumference of the mountains belonged to one person a nobler scene for improvement could not well be conceived This grand circumfer∣ence it is true in all it's vastness and extent sets at nought all human power and resists every idea of improvement yet still in some parts an impression might be made It might be rendered  more accessible  it might be  cleared of deformities  it might be  planted  and it might be  decorated  In the first place it might be rendered  more accessible  We have just seen how dif∣ficult it is to get round the lake in it's present state Half it's beauties are lost An easy road therefore might be traced I do not merely mean a good carriage road but such a road as might both form a pleasing line in itself and shew the beauties of the lake to the best advantage This improvement would require both taste and study Many a survey of the lake should be taken both from the higher and lower grounds to find out where the road might open on some beautiful part without losing it's own beauty where it might run obliquely and give only catching viewsor where it might en∣tirely lose all view of the lake A pause in a grand continuation of scenery is often as pleasing as in a concert of music It makes the eye in one case as the ear in the other more alert for every new exhibition  Besides this ample road round the lake there might be a variety of paths and se∣questered walks cut through it from which in some part or other every scene of the lake might be viewed in it's most picturesque form  Our next business would be to  remove deformities  such  deformities  especially as ob∣truded themselves from the road or paths And here I should perhaps find a difficulty in settling with many people what was a  deformity  In  nature's works  there is seldom any  deformity  Rough knolls and rocks and broken ground are of the very essence of beautiful landscape It is man with his utensils who prints the mark of  deformity  on Nature's works Almost every thing in which he is concerned I should wish to re∣move In these rough grounds indeed there is not much of this kind that offends and some of his works the cottage especially under particular circumstances is an object of beauty tho in general these are not the scenes which it suits  But notwithstanding the beauties of nature it may happen that some deformities even in her operations may exist We often observe the craggy points and summits of mountains not well formed and the mountain itself not exactly shaped With these things however we must rest satisfiedYet sometimes in  smaller matters a natural  deformity  may be done away An awkward knoll on the  fore∣ground  may offend which art may remove or at least correct It may remove also bushes and rough underwood which tho often picturesque are yet sometimes in the way It may remove also a tree or a clump which may have placed themselves between the eye and some beautiful part of the scene Farther than this we dare not moveunless perhaps we wish to give the line of the lake a more pleasing sweep by paring away cautiously very cautiouslyhere and there a little of it's margin  We begin next with  planting  In this business the improver might wish to have the lake in it's primeval state surrounded with ancient wood He might wish that  cutting away  rather than  planting  should be neces∣sary but as that cannot be he must be con∣te  t to plant and this he must do chiefly for the sake of posterity whom he must leave  to admire  his work for tho he may plant it will require an age to bring his work to perfection  The chief uses of planting in scenery are to  set off beauty  and to  hide  such deformities as we cannot  remove  Nature has various coverings for her sur∣faces Grass is her principal and general covering This however is only a thin dress close and tight which following the form of her limbs gives little  ornament  to them Weeds of various kinds shrubs and brush∣wood form another species of vest and often a rich one But her richest and most orna∣mental mantle is wood which she spreads in various forms and various colours over the earth and in uninhabited countries in such profusion often as to blot out landscape In inhabited countries however woods of this close texture and wide continuance are un∣common yet we always wish for a command of such wood in all our improvementsnot only for the reason already given that old timber is more beautiful than young but because nature always plants with much more picturesque beauty than man Man cannot put a twig into the ground without formality and if he put in a dozen together let him put them in with what art he please his awkward handywork will hardly ever be  effaced Nature would be ashamed to own his workat least till it had been matured by a long course of years The best mode of planting is to plant profusely and thus to afford scope for the felling axe The felling axe is the instrument which gives the finishing touch of picturesque effect It forms the outline and marks the breaks No human judgment can manage this business compleatly in the first planting yet human judgment in the first planting should nevertheless do what it can and under the management of taste these artificial woods may attain great beauty and vie in some degree with the superior effect of nature  As for any particular rules for planting such a scene as this none can be given They must be adapted to the spot Foregrounds and backgrounds are equally susceptible of the beauties of wood Only in general contrast should be observed The whole side of a hill for instance should not be planted but parts of it left bare Sometimes the top may be planted and sometimes the bottom and if the wood run down to the lake in one part in another the contiguous shore will perhaps appear better unadorned The fore∣grounds  however must generally be adorned with wood  But wood besides it's use in adorning landscape is of use also in hiding it's defor∣mities The lake and it's invirons however beautiful will always have many parts to hide But to hide them from every station would be impossible In so extensive a scene they must present themselves in numberless places And yet perhaps the same object may appear from one station as a beauty and present itself from another as a deformity All however that can be done on this head is to have respect to the several roads and paths you have marked out and to en∣deavour as much as possible by trees on the foreground to plant out from thence at least every thing offensive Even some of the illformed points and prominences of mountains where they are most offensive may be skreened in some views at least by the foliage of a spreading tree  We come lastly to the  adorning  of such a scene as this I mean the  addition of artificial ornament  But before any  mode of ornament  can be settled the question must be asked For what  purpose  do you mean to adorn Do you intend to build a mansion in some part of the scene Or do you mean it only for the wild sce∣nery of a park or what is commonly called a riding We have yet done nothing but what may be accommodated alike to both these purposes  If you mean to  build  it behoves you well to fix the spot with judgment I should traverse the boundaries of the lake many times examine it in all seasons and not determine a point of such importance in less than half a summer I should at once however resolve not to follow the example of the earls of Der∣wentwater and choose one of the little flat unvaried islands for my residence These islands may often make the  object  of a scene but none of them has extent to make a  scene itself  or to unite well with the scenery around  Having determined your spot and built your house you next  adorn  it Much of the wild brushwood of the country must give way and an elegant neatness take place which growing rougher by degrees will unite itself  with the wildness of the country Having levelled the ground where too rough and and given an elegant play to it you next plant your groves and clumps open your lawns and conduct your walks In all these things the situation you have chosen must determine you If it could be done commo∣diously I should wish to have the grand lawn before the house sweep down to the water's edge And yet I should not be per∣tinacious on this point because other views of the lake might be equally interesting  When you have thus laid out your different scenes I should not object to your adorning so large an extent with a temple or two provided they were objects pleasing in them∣selves adapted to their situations and not both seen glaring together I should not even object if you chose to place some art∣less object as a point of view on the other side of the lake for I conclude your house or some of the grand walks will open to the opposite shores If you choose to adorn your distant view in this way let not the object you make choice of be some odd appearing thing staring from the top of a hill like a tower or a spire where you know no such  thing could probably be placed Neither let it stand directly in the front of your view the design of it will be suspected As to the  kind of object  it must be something which will not disgrace your invention if it is to be seen upon the spot It will be difficult to direct you But if you hesitate about a proper ob∣ject you had better at once give up the in∣tention  But perhaps you do not mean to build a  mansion  but mean only to adorn the invirons of the lake as a  wild park scene  In that case little ornament will be wanting If the ruins of a castle or abbey  could be  built and sta∣tioned with verisimilitude and propriety they would undoubtedly be a great ornament Their station should be accommodated to the road and walks and yet must appear not as if fixed by design for the purpose of ornament but as if naturally chosen They should also be in a magnificent style If you are satisfied with bringing a few loads of brick or stone and putting them together in some odd shape white∣ning them over and calling them a ruin you had better do nothing You may disgrace what you wished to adorn and should always  remember that the scene is able to support itself without any ornament  I know no other ornaments proper to the invirons of the lake except perhaps a bridge or two for which I should think there might be great choice of situations But I should wish the form of them to be that of the  rumbling brig  in Scotland  See Vol I page  rather as joining rocky chasms than as passages over rivulets Of course therefore they should be so constructed as to serve the purposes of the road The form of an aqueduct might be introduced with propriety The Alpine bridge also might have a good effect Such a bridge is constructed only of a few rough pines split and held together by raf∣ters and pins Chasms over which such bridges might be thrown are frequent about the lake But here too you must follow the ideas of  probability  which is  nature  as far as it goes and throw the bridge over some part where it appears really to be wanted Your path must lead over it or at least be directed over some safer place in it's neigh∣bourhood  that the  danger of the bridge  may appear plainly to be the  cause of it's desertion  But in all matter of ornament let me once more advise you to be sparing I have heard that since these observations were made the lake of Keswick as well as other lakes hath been injured by some miserable and tasteless orna∣ments  From this censure I should wish to exclude some improve∣ments which have lately been made on the western side of the lake by lord William Gordon I never saw them and only accidentally heard of them since this work went to the press but from what I could learn I should suppose they are made as far as they go on the principles here laid down  Let me intreat you not to add to them nor to incourage a wretched taste which may in time as each proprietor of the lake takes it into his head creep every where around it and destroy by degrees the simpli∣city and beauty of one of the grandest and most pleasing scenes in Britain  SECT XXXVIII  FROM Keswick we took the common road to Kendal and were greatly amu∣sed as we had often been before with the grandeur and beauty of the scenery which two ideas go hand in hand through all this country Sometimes one prevails sometimes the other and sometimes we are struck with the united force of both Ideas of simple grandeur were generally suggested between Keswick and Ambleside and of beauty chiefly between Ambleside and Kendal  From Kendal to Lancaster the country assumes a tamer aspect At Lancaster we could not avoid ascending the castlehill to admire the scene of distant mountains it dis∣played  tho we had often admired it before But it was now attended with accompaniments which were new to us and which of course made the scene a new one as all scenes are when viewed in different lights and different seasons The day was rough and boisterous and tho we had often seen this grand bay in a calm we had never before seen it in a storm The tide had wholly overspread it and tho there was not depth of water as the whole bay is at best but a flooded sandbank to stir up the grand swells of the ocean yet it had depth enough to be greatly agi∣tated  But if it's waters wanted  depth  they had  extent  fully proportioned to the mountains that invironed them and all together pro∣duced a very grand effect The greatness however of this noble exhibition arose chiefly from the adventitious circumstances which attended it The violence of the storm had confounded in one mass of driving vapours air sea and mountains and the sublimity lay in the emerging of each of these objects occasionally from the mass of confusion in which it was involved Sometimes the broad back of a mountain would appear while  the imagination was at a loss to find out on what base the mighty fabric was erected for all it's lower skirts were obscured Some∣times the base appeared whitened by the surges of the shore while the summit of the moun∣tain involved in vapour left the imagination to seek it among the clouds Even objects still smaller did not want their effect The serried files of such seafowl as fly in flocks urging their flight through the storm in firm array were contrasted by others of a more devious course as the gull particularly which turning her breast and wings to the wind gave herself to the blast and was carried away far to leeward as if delighted with sporting in the storm then as the gust had spent it's force she would recover her course mount again into the air and again renew her aerial pastime  But the greatest ornaments of this boisterous bay were the skiffs which traversed it in various parts making to the little ports which lie along it's shores Their different forms and groups as they were tumbled about by the wind were very amusing One vessel there was of larger dimensions which seemed to have been out at sea and from her ragged  sails to have suffered from the storm She was working her course with an adverse wind in  tacks  as they phrase it athwart the bay In some situations her appearance was formal but when she was foreshortened heeling from the wind and driving the white∣ned sea before her she was very picturesque Shakespear had his beautiful moral ready on every occasion On the exhibition of such a picture he would say  How like a prodigal  The scarsed bark puts from her native bay  Hugged and embraced by the strumpet wind  How like a prodigal doth she return  With weatherbeaten ribs and ragged sails  Torn crazed and beggared by the strumpet wind  In the mean time we could have wished for a burst of resplendency to throw at inter∣vals a vivid ray on the landscapeto brighten the mountain top or the swelling sail of the skiff Nothing is more picturesque than a storm thus enlightened  See Northern Tour Vol I page  But we were not so fortunate One gloomy tint overspread the whole picture and the several objects that  were seen were seen rather from an  indistinct shadow  than any  effect of light  One appearance indeed we had of solar illumination which is of no use in enlighten∣ing objects but is exceedingly picturesque and that is those broad diverging beams which the sun concealed behind a cloud shoots down through a cloudy horizon But let the painter when he adorns his landscape with appearances of this kind take care that they diverge naturally Without a little phi∣losophy the best efforts of his pencil will be awkward I have seen a picture in which the artist wished to adorn his landscape with a rainbow but thinking a semicircle rather formal he drew it in perspective  This bay from the setting of the currents is at all times subject to very rapid tides But when the wind is strong from the south∣west the waters rush in with a violence that is astonishing as many unfortunate travellers have fatally experienced Nor is this the only danger with which these pathless deserts are attended The tide often leaves them interspersed with quicksands which vary their situation As it saves however several miles to cross this track of sand from Lancaster  to Ulverston Cartmel and the other towns upon the coast you can seldom look over it from the station where we now stood when the tide is at ebb without seeing it  figured  as the landscapepainter speaks with several passengers sometimes solitary and sometimes in companies For the accommodation of travellers the government pay two guides from the rents of Conishedabbey as the monks formerly did who relieve each other and conduct passengers at stated hours over the most dangerous parts tho many people who think they are as well acquainted with the fords themselves trust to their own dis∣cretion  SECT XXXIX  AS we leave Lancaster the broken coast still affords us many views of land and water with stretches of sand interspersed which to a common eye appear only barren tracts of dreariness but the picturesque eye finds often a great amusement in them  See Vol I page  and if they are happily illumined contemplates in them some of the finest effects of har∣mony At this time indeed they were under the influence of a rough unpleasant day  About a mile beyond Garstang we had a very fine distant view of a different kind different indeed from any thing we had seen  for many weeksa flat woody country terminated by light azure hills which ap∣peared  small and undistinguishable  Like faroff mountains turning into clouds  They were such in fact We here took a farewell view of the mountainous country we had passed The  faroff mountains  became by degrees  small and undistinguishable  and soon  turning into clouds  disappeared  The general character of all this country through which we now travelled is that of flat and woody About Charnock the ground is varied and the scenery more beautiful  In Lancashire we frequently observed a breed of large cattle which in the country is called the  waghorn breed  from the manner in which the horn bends under the eye In other countries I have heard them called  loughhorned  but throughout England they are commonly known by the name of the  Lancashire breed of cattle  They are said to be fleshy and more proper for the shambles than the dairy  tho in Lancashire we were told they are esteemed the best milchcows Their twisted horns give them a peculiar and picturesque cast of countenance  The country between Wigan and War∣rington still continues flat and woody The soil is a loose sand insomuch that the poplar and other quick growing trees whose roots creep about the surface often receive a cast from the wind which gives them a disagree∣able appearance An inclined tree may be picturesque but to make it so it must always be wellbalanced A tree which inclines when it is young naturally forms a balance as it grows but when it takes an inclined direction after it is full grown it immedi∣ately appears to be in an unnatural state  The lanes in this country are pleasant but the roads are rough The soil produces no materials to make them and the inhabi∣tants are obliged to fetch stones from the Welch coast the freight and carriage of which raises the expence of the roads in many parts to the enormous sum of one thousand pounds a mile  Here and there in passing through the country we have long flat distances over  which rise the high grounds of Derbyshire A new house built by Mr Smith Barry commands an extensive woody flat of this kind towards Cheshire bounded by Delamereforest But his brother's house stands more pleasantly by the side of Marberrymere which is a considerable and beautiful piece of water  By degrees the face of the country becomes more varied We admire a woody dip at Wynchcombbridge and near it a common pleasantly circled with clumps and single trees Mowcap hill crowned with a sort of castlelike form which has a good effect is seen far and wide adorning as a back∣ground all the scenes in it's neighbourhood It is a poor substitute for a Scotch mountain yet it is sufficient to remind us frequently in our different views of it of the great use of high grounds in landscapeAs we approach Trentham the country assumes a still more varied appearance  Trentham is the seat of earl Gower now marquiss of Stafford When we were last in this country a wet day prevented our seeing more of it than we could discover from  the road  See Observations c V I p  We had now the opportunity of a fine evening and saw it to better advan∣tage The house stands low at the bottom of a woody hill on the banks of the Trent and tho there is nothing very peculiarly strik∣ing in the situation yet it consists of con∣siderable variety in point of ground wood and water Of all this Mr Brown who was called in to improve it has made a masterly use and has adapted with great judgement his im∣provements to the ground The contrivance is more varied than the works of this artist com∣monly are and the result is a scene of great simplicity and beautyI may add of magni∣ficence also The Trent is here a river of no great consequence but being checked in it's course by a head it forms a large piece of water which sweeps along the side of the park where the ground from the wooded hill falls beautifully into it in all directions A very elegant walk likewise is conducted first by the edge of the water and then among the woods from many parts of which the house makes a magnificent appearance beyond the lake forming picturesque reflections upon it's  surface The shores of the water on the side opposite to the park have little to recom∣mend them at present They are flat newly planted and without any effect and the head or mole has yet rather an awkward appear∣ance running a considerable way like a hedge Whether a lake or a river is aimed at the extremities should be provided for and if the artificial squareness of the mole which forms the lake cannot be hid or disguised the idea of a  lake  should be dropped and that of a  river  adopted Pliny's rule tho given on a different occasion cannot be too scrupulously observed  Ambire debet se extremitas et sic definere ut promittat alia post se ostendatque quae occultat  But as a dozen years have now elapsed since these observations were made many improvements may have taken place and the whole line of the lake may be altered Upon the whole however we seldom see a piece of artificial ground which from it's variety and management is more capable of gaining the attentionA very fine ap∣proach to the park on the side next Stone is now forming The line is good in which it is marked out round a hill Handsome gates are already erected  From Trentham to Stone the road is plea∣sant winding among hills but as we enter more into Staffordshire the country loses it's beauty  Enville the seat of the earl of Stamford stands low but most of the grounds which belong to it are high and these high grounds are the most beautiful appendages of the place They are simple sheepwalks and consist of large lawns and plantations intermixed but are more varied more natural and more pleasing than the neighbouring lawns of the celebrated Hagley They pretend to no de∣coration but that of nature and when nature at any time condescends with her own hand to decorate a scene removing what is offen∣sive and bringing before the eye such objects only as please whether of the sublime or as here of the pastoral kind it is surely paying her no very high compliment to say she exceeds the utmost attempts of art In these grounds if any art hath been used it hath been used with great judgement To  this pleasing foreground is added a distance proportioned to it in extent and equal to it in beauty We overlook an extensive view on both sides On one towards the Clent and Malvernhills and on the other as far as the Wrekin I cannot describe this dis∣tance better than in the words of Thomson who spent much of his time in this country and seems to have collected all the ingredients of this landscape from some hill in the neigh∣bourhood  Mean time you gain the height from whose fair brow  The bursting prospect spreads immense around  And snatch'd o'er hill and dale and wood and lawn  And verdant field and darkening heath between  And villages imbosomed soft in trees  And spiry towns by dusky columns mark'd  Of rising smoak your eye excursive roams  We strayed a long time among these beautiful lawns before we descended to the lower grounds One view in our descent parti∣cularly pleased us It is a valley skreened on each side with wood and bounded by distant country and mountains The lower grounds near the house are more decorated by art as they certainly ought to be but it was unfortunate that we had not seen them  before we saw the sheepwalks From such an exhibition it required some time to bring the eye in humour with the most pleasing artificial scene  From Enville the country grows unpleasant On the left we have good views about the hun∣dred and sixth stone Pershorechurch as you approach and the distances beyond it make a good pictureThe celebrated vale of Eves∣ham possesses little that is picturesque It is a mere extended scene of cultivation Vales of this kind have no place in landscape but the distance They afford no circumstances on the spot Near the close of the vale a little to the right of Broadwayhill the skreen of the vale is woody and more beautiful The view as we descend Portenhill is very amusing It lies chiefly within the compass of a second distanceSoon after we deviated a few miles to see Bulstrode  Bulstrode belongs to the duchess dowager of Portland  Now to the duke of Portland  The park is a pleasant rather  than a striking scene It consists of a great variety of rising and falling grounds without water indeed but in many parts wellplanted and every where simple and unforced  On a height in one part of it is a cir∣cular flat about half a mile in circumference which has evidently been a camp but whe∣ther of British Danish or Roman structure is not easily known You plainly trace a mound and a double ditch The scene itself surrounded by wood is pleasing  The house formerly belonged to the cele∣brated Judge Jeffereys but is now greatly altered and improved It stands on a gentle rise which slopes into a semicircular valley composed of parkscenery The approach which was formerly regular winds now in an easy line along a valley Behind the house runs the garden where plants and flowers of every kind find their proper soil and shel∣ter One large portion is called the American grove consisting of the plants of that con∣tinent Here too the duchess has her mena∣gery She is fond of animals and among many that are curious incourages the very squirrels and hares to enjoy a state of perfect  tranquillity The squirrel cracks his nut at your elbow and looks at you without dis∣may while the hare at her pleasure takes her morning and evening gambols about the park which she considers as her own domain When the bell rings for dinner a servant carries out a basket of corn which he lays in little heaps upon the lawn before the diningroom windows The hares know both the signal and the intention of their bene∣factress and assembling from all parts bring their little families with them and enjoy their meal in great comfort  The house contains some good pictures One particularly by Rubens in which he has given several different attitudes of himself and his three wives is much admired There are also two or three wellpainted heads Two lions pursuing a fawn by Rubens are thought capital The lions are good but unnaturally introduced They are quarrelling about a fawn before they have taken it The truth is the fawn does not belong to the lions We have them in other pictures with∣out it Lord Warwick I believe has the lions without the fawn  The hall is hung with a large collection of huntings by Snyders In the bear and bullbaiting are some excellent dogs but in general these pictures are only hasty compo∣sitions  Among the works of art at Bulstrode which abounds chiefly with the curiosities of nature we were favoured with a sight of one by Mrs Delany which we greatly admired Mrs Delany is widow of the late Dr Delany dean of Down one of the intimate friends of dean Swift She is now seventysix years of age and enjoys her faculties in such vigour that you find not the least faultering in any of them The work of hers which I allude to is an herbal in which she has executed a great number of plants and flowers both natives and exotics not only with exact de∣lineation and almost in their full lustre of colour but in great taste And what is the most extraordinary her only materials are bits of paper of different colours In the process of her work she pulls the flower in pieces examines anatomically the structure of it's leaves stems and buds and having cut her papers to the shape of the several parts she puts them together giving them a richness  and consistence by laying one piece over ano∣ther and often a transparent piece over part of a shade which softens it Very rarely she gives any colour with a brush She pastes them as she works upon a black ground which at first I thought rather injured them as a middle tint would have given more strength to the shades but I doubt whether it would have answered in effect These flowers have both the beauty of painting and the exactness of botany and the work I have no doubt into whatever hands it may here∣after fall will long be considered as a great curiosity  Mrs Delany died in the beginning of the year She continued her work till within two or three years of her death and compleated nine volumes in folio each vo∣lume containing one hundred plants    From Bulstrode we took the Uxbridge road At Hillingdon opposite to the church stands a very noble cedar of Lebanon indeed almost the only truly picturesque tree of the kind I ever met with  Soon after we entered Hounslowheath and called at Witton which belonged formerly to the duke of Argyle The duke was the greatest connoisseur in trees of any man in England and naturalized great numbers He piqued himself on having his trees in the greatest perfection If a tree did not  imme∣diately  thrive he never waited for it's growth but put in another In the house and gar∣dens there is little besides that is remark∣able  From Witton we proceeded through Twic∣kenham where the garden of Pope is still shewn in the state in which he left it It is surprizing to see such an effort of real taste at a time when the country was barbarous in all it's ideas of gardening He is said to have been assisted by Kent but I think it not at all a determined point whether he did not give Kent more assistance than he received Pope certainly assumed to himself the merit of forming this piece of ground and used often to say with perhaps some  little degree of affectation that of all his works he valued himself most on his garden What Sir William Stanhope added af∣terwards tho he had the ideas of a more improved day to guide him is very inferior  As we leave Twickenham the Thames opens beautifully and forms a fine reach But notwithstanding it's beauty and even grandeurthe richness of it's banksand the gorgeous villas that crown them it still falls short in a picturesque light of a Scotch river with all it's rough accompaniments pouring over rocks and forming a thousand little foaming eddies The eye so long in the habit of admiring the wild scenes of na∣ture cannot easily forget those inchanting images Every kindred object raises a recol∣lection of the past and every recollection a comparison in which the tame tho inriched scenes of art are sure to suffer  To enumerate only in a catalogue the se∣veral splendid villas that adorn even this part of the Thames would be tedious What  is chiefly the object of a stranger's notice is Mr Walpole's house at Strawberryhill He has rebuilt it for it was before an old man∣sion in the Gothic style as the most proper receptacle for the many curious and rich remains of antiquity with which it is adorned But through the inability of his architects particularly of Langley who tho esteemed capital in his day knew nothing of the art of constructing modern Gothic his ideas were never properly executed Mr Walpole often complained they were rather Moorish than Gothic however as he could not at that day procure better assistance he was obliged to acquiesce in what he could not amend He was always however among the first to depreciate his own architecture  With regard to the inside of his house he early saw that insipid taste prevailing which is now so general of adorning walls and cielings with light faint gaudy colours and endeavoured to introduce a tone of har∣mony into his apartments and to relieve the furniture by an opposition of colour in the rooms where it was placed He always how∣ever lamented that he fell short of his own designs but still he raised the admiration  of others who had a less accurate taste than he had himself and were pleased with some∣thing which they could not account for  The garden contains about ten acres It consists of a lawn and open grove and is considered only as a foreground to a beau∣tiful bend of the Thames and the landscape beyond it which displays some of the rich distances in that neighbourhoodvery unlike indeed the grand and simple views we had seen in the highlands of Scotland but more assimilated to the character of a southern coun∣ty A Scotch landscape beyond the rich views of the Thames would be as absurd in a picture as it would be unnatural in a real view  In an angle of the garden stands a Gothic chapel containing a lofty rich shrine of ancient Mosaic which is exceedingly curious  But tho the house is richly adorned with remains of antiquity which present them∣selves in every apartment yet they are a small part of those rarer productions of art drawingsmedalsenamelsand miniatures which are contained in cabinets In the three last articles especially most of which  consist of the portraits of eminent men I suppose few private collections are either so copious or so curious  From Twickenham we crossed the Thames at Kingston and proceeded into Surrey  THE END  Since the last sheet of this work was printed I have received some circumstances with regard to the affair of Paul Jones mentioned in the th page of the second volume which I am de∣sired to add  Soon after the ships left the bay Jones informed Lord Selkirk by a letter that he avowed indeed the intention of carrying his lordship off but with a design merely to get a cartel established through the means of such a prisoner As to taking the plate he said he totally disavowed it his crew forced him to it being determined to have a little plunder for the risk they had run both in Kircudbrightbay and in attempting the night before to burn the shipping at WhitehavenTo this apology Jones added a promise to restore the plate which on the peace seven years after the depredation was punctually performed It was put into the hands of Lord Selkirk's banker in London and not the least article was missingThis restitution has the appearance of gene∣rosity but I think it probable that Jones might feel for his pro∣fessional character which he found would suffer under the infamy of such a pilfering transaction  ACCOUNT OF THE PRINTS  WITH regard to the prints which adorn these volumes I can only say what I have said of those in other publications of the same kind that few of them pretend to be  exact portraits  They in general  only charac∣terize the countries  through which the reader is carried They were slightly taken in the course of a hasty journey and at best meant only to preserve the great lines of the country and even this I fear not always accurately I have heretofore made confession to the public that when I have seen a line out of place I have a great propensity to correct it by one that is more picturesque  I would not however wish these drawings to be considered merely as the effusions of  fancy In those views in which the features are strong and prominent as in the approach to Edinburgh to Sterling and to Dunbarton I hope  the character of the place  is tolerably con∣veyed in others which offer nothing striking  the character of the country  only is attempted  But indeed on so small a scale it would be impossible to give an adequate idea of a grand scene However exact the portrait might be yet under such paltry dimensions the eye would revolt against the idea of grandeur Were it painted indeed with exactness on a pane of glass in a window and the eye brought to it under the deception of it's being a real view the imagination might aggrandize it But I am clearly of opinion that without deception a few inches of paper can never give any thing like an adequate idea of gran∣deur  And here I am glad of an opportunity of mentioning a set of Scotch views which will soon be published and will intirely super∣sede any portraits which at best I could have given They are on the large scale of twentyfive inches by eighteen which is both a good size and a good proportion And tho prints even of this magnitude are nothing  when compared to the grand scenes of nature yet as they are larger than prints of landscape commonly are the eye gives them some cre∣dit for the dimensions they represent These views were drawn and I believe will be etched by Mr Joseph Farington  I am not in the least acquainted with that artist but as I have admired several of his prints from the drawings he made on the lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland I cannot forego the pleasure of mentioning these Scotch views which I doubt not will be in the same stile of excellence Mr Farington's scheme is very extensive comprehending se∣veral parts of Scotland but the views he now offers to the public are taken from the scenery about Edinburgh Sterling and the banks of the Forth which are so far in the direct rout described in these pages and I serve myself in mentioning them They are an appendix to my work These views I under∣stand also by the proposals will still be ren∣dered more valuable by explanatory descriptions of each by Mr Knox of the antiquarian society at Edinburgh  But tho in comparison with such grand views as I take it for granted these will be  I speak contemptibly of my own  diminutive  drawings yet I hope I may offer them to the public with some little confidence as  pictures  at least as far as they go tho not as exact  portraits  Of the free and elegant manner in which they are executed by Mr Alkin in aquatinta who compleated the whole work himself I can speak with great assurance He has given me much satisfaction and I hope he will give equal satisfaction to the public The elegance of his workmanship makes up for the defects of the drawings  VOL I    A copy of the shilling which king Charles the first in his necessity ordered to be stamped at the siege of Newark page    A resemblance of the picturesque bridge at Hawick    A perspective view of the mountains at Ferney I cannot however say that in this print my idea is well conveyed A very small touch in so diminutive a print injures the form of a mountain and these have lost some∣what of their picturesque form Mr Alkin would have altered them but it is so nice a matter to make alterations in aquatinta that he was afraid of doing more hurt than good    Approach to Edinburgh I do not think the appearance of Arthur's seat and the rocks about Edinburgh which present at a distance the appearance of a cap of maintenance is overcharged in this print    A corner of the rock on which Edin∣burghcastle stands with the bridge over the north loch    A plan of the situation of Hopeton house but by no means taken with exactness p    The frith of Forth from the lawn before Hopetonhouse where it takes the form of a lake    Blacknesscastle in which something of the indistinct appearance which it made after sunset is aimed at    Approach to the castle of Sterling    Lochleven The general idea of the scene only is aimed at The form of the castle is  not exact and the mountain beyond it is not so broken as it is here represented but in endeavouring too accurately to correct every little impropriety in plates of this kind I found there was great danger of losing the spirit of the whole    View of  Rumblingbrig  A general idea of the scene only is given but a detail of those picturesque roughnesses and irregularities with which it is marked is not attempted    A sandbank c on the Tummel    Two prints to illustrate a mode of fixing the hues of nature The three original colours yellow blue and red may be varied infinitely Two of them in different proportions will produce endless variety But when the three are mixed it exceeds all conception what  different colours may be produced A scale however of this kind would be more compleat by the addition of the best browns reds c which cannot be obtained in such perfection from a mixture of the three original colours The several squares of colours in the different leaves of such a book as this might be classed under the heads of  Brownsgreenspurples  c which would make them more easily referred to

habits which every man had when alive continue with him after death  He was a prince remarkable for every virtue but above all for clemency  A pricked line  Except in the neighbourhood of a town the country is desolate and barren  The icy Erne weeps over vast heaps of slain  The Britons in troops consisting of men and women fled every where with  lamentable cries dragging away the wounded and calling on those who had escaped Their houses were de∣serted and by themselves often set on fire Hidingplaces were sought out and immediately forsaken Plans of defence were debated and hope for a moment entertained Then perhaps the sight of their wives and children would drive them to despair Rage and frantic wildness would succeed and it was affirmed that many of them put their families to the sword declaring they did it in mere pity  Page If the language of a dramatic cha∣racter varies from his situation in life the absurdity will be received with contempt  Either make the character agreeable to history or make the fiction consistent with itself  Let the dramatic writer study well the manners of real life and draw his characters from thence  A noble palace supported by a hun∣dred columns and skreened by vene∣rable  woods which have seen many generations  Page Here the kings of the country received their crowns and sceptres  If there is truth in fate the Scotch will always hold the reins of empire where this stone is found  Which overlooks a distant country  In the wars of barbarians rage and victory leave no kind of cruelty unprac∣tised  VOL II  AND cloaths them with purple light  Sometimes joining together they orm a continent sometimes under the impres∣sion of uncertain gusts they divide and are driven about in various directions Then again a calm coming on they float upon the surface of the lake in separate  bodies and often their connection is so whimsical great and small adhering that that they appear at a distance like vessels at anchor with their boats Then the gale perhaps rising they all set off to∣gether as if sailing for a wager all making to the same point  The foaming wave dashes the rock while the quivering seaweed is lashed from side to side  This rock is of so hard a texture that the keenest instrument can scarce touch it and if by any violence or accident a piece is broken off it emits a strong smell like sulphur  In the midst of an extensive plain near the river Molucha stood an immense rock fortified with a considerable castle One only pass led to it and that exceed∣ingly narrow On each other side it was steep as if hewn by art  Where the Leven falls into the Clyde on a plain extending about a mile to the neighbouring mountains rises a rock with two summits between which an ascent by steps has been hewn in the solid rock  with infinite labour but so narrow that one person only can ascend at once  On the summit of a hill stood a fortress so advantageously seated that it defied any mode of attack but a blockade At the bottom it was defended by two rivers and the plain it stood on extended about three miles  Horrid forms appear  They were perfectly white with rough manes like lions in other respects they were like common cattle  In the Caledonian forest are produced a species of white cattle with manes like lions of a nature so fierce that it is im∣possible to tame them But as their flesh is esteemed very palatable the breed is said to be almost extinct  In it's natural state untouched by the rake uninjured by the plough  What you call a desert and inhospitable tract has abundant charms for him who thinks with me  A piny mountaintop  The foaming rivers rush down the moun∣tain sides with impetuous course  A more hardy race of men who are a kind of foresters inhabit the northern and highland parts of the country They are cloathed in a vest over which they fling a mantle and wear no covering on their legs as far as the knee They are armed with a bow and arrows a sword exceedingly broad and a dagger which cuts on one side only  The extremities ought to wind in such a manner as to promise something still beyond them and to lead the imagina∣tion to investigate parts unseen  ERRATA  VOL I

which I have no other means of correcting In the preface to some picturesque observations I lately published on the Lakes and Mountains of Cumberland and Westmoreland I assert p that  Gothic ar∣chitecture is no where found but in England except in such parts of France as were in possession of the English  I have since found this to be a mistake I had supposed indeed that all the old buildings on the Continent were of a kind of anomalous architecture very different from what we denominate Gothic in England But a friend who had contributed to lead me into the mistake has since led me out of it He is a good judge of Saxon and Gothic architecture in their various combi∣nations and informs me in a letter from Germany that the great church at Cologne which he had examined on the spot is very much in the style of Yorkminster tho upon a more ample plan The cathedral too at Ulm is pure Gothic tho the ori∣ginal plan neither there nor at Cologne is compleated The great chruch at Auxerre in Burgundy he thought at least equal in elegance to any Gothic building he had any where seen tho it wants the grandeur of the lengthened isle Even the cathe∣dral of Milan he found true Gothic In short he traced that stile of architecture not only in the cathedrals but in the parishchurches through France Germany and Italy as far as NaplesThe  history  of Gothic architecture appears to me there∣fore to be very little known We can trace Grecian and Roman architecture howewer scattered through Europe to one common origin but where shall we seek the origin of Saxon and Gothic
