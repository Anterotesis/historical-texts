 ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM  In THREE VOLUMES  VOLUME I  EDINBURGH Printed for A MILLAR London AND A KINCAID J BELL Edinburgh MDCCLXII  TO THE KING  SIR  THE fine arts have ever been encouraged by wise princes not singly for private amusement but for their beneficial influence in society By uniting different ranks in the same elegant pleasures they promote benevolence by cherishing love of order they inforce submission to government and by inspiring delicacy of feeling they make regular government a double blessing  THESE considerations embolden me to hope for your Majesty's patronage in behalf of the following work which treats of the fine arts and attempts to form a standard of taste by unfolding those principles that ought to govern the taste of every individual  IT is rare to find one born with such delicacy of feeling as not to need instruction it is equally rare to find one so low in feeling as not to be capable of instruction And yet to refine our taste with respect to beauties of art or of nature is scarce endeavoured in any seminary of learning a lamentable defect considering how early in life taste is susceptible of culture and how difficult to reform it if unhappily perverted To furnish materials for supplying that defect was an additional motive for the present undertaking  TO promote the fine arts in Britain has become of greater importance than is generally imagined A flourishing commerce begets opulence and opulence inflaming our appetite for pleasure is commonly vented on luxury and on every sensual gratification Selfishness rears its head becomes fashionable and infecting all ranks extinguishes the  amor patriae  and every spark of public spirit To prevent or to retard such fatal corruption the genius of an Alfred cannot devise any means more efficacious than venting opulence upon the fine arts Riches so employ'd instead of encouraging vice will excite both public and private virtue Of this happy effect ancient Greece furnishes one shining instance and why should we despair of another in Britain  IN the commencement of an auspicious reign and even in that early period of  life when pleasure commonly is the sole pursuit your Majesty has uniformly display'd to a delighted people the noblest principles ripened by early culture and for that reason you will be the more disposed to favour every rational plan for advancing the art of training up youth Among the many branches of education that which tends to make deep impressions of virtue ought to be a fundamental measure in a wellregulated government for depravity of manners will render ineffectual the most salutary laws and in the midst of opulence what other means to prevent such depravity but early and virtuous discipline The British discipline is susceptible of great improvements and if we can hope for them it must be from a young and accomplished Prince eminently sensible of their importance To establish a complete system of education seems reserved by providence for a Sovereign who commands  the hearts of his subjects Success will crown the undertaking and endear GEORGE THE THIRD to our latest posterity  THE most elevated and most refined pleasure of human nature is enjoy'd by a virtuous prince governing a virtuous people and that by perfecting the great system of education your Majesty may very long enjoy this pleasure is the ardent wish of

for example made upon the hand by a stone upon the palate by sugar and upon the nostrils by a rose But there is a difference as to our consciousness of that impression In touching tasting and smelling we are conscious of the impression Not so in seeing and hearing When I behold a tree I am not sensible of the impression made upon my eye nor of the impression made upon my ear when I listen to a song  See the Appendix §  This difference in the manner of perception distinguishes remarkably hearing and seeing from the other senses and distinguishes still more remarkably the feelings of the former from those of the latter A feeling pleasant or painful cannot exist but in the mind and yet because  in tasting touching and smelling we are conscious of the impression made upon the organ we naturally place there also the pleasant or painful feeling caused by that impression And because such feelings seem to be placed externally at the organ of sense we for that reason conceive them to be merely corporeal We have a different apprehension of the pleasant and painful feelings derived from seeing and hearing Being insensible here of the organic impression we are not misled to assign a wrong place to these feelings and therefore we naturally place them in the mind where they really exist Upon that account they are conceived to be more refined and spiritual than what are derived from tasting touching and smelling  The pleasures of the eye and ear being thus elevated above those of the other external senses acquire so much dignity as to make them a laudable entertainment They are not however set upon a level with those that are purely intellectual being not less inferior in dignity to intellectual pleasures than superior to the organic or corporeal  They indeed resemble the latter being like them produced by external objects but they also resemble the former being like them produced without any sensible organic impression Their mixt nature and middle place betwixt organic and intellectual pleasures qualify them to associate with either Beauty heightens all the organic feelings as well as those that are intellectual Harmony though it aspires to inflame devotion disdains not to improve the relish of a banquet  The pleasures of the eye and ear have other valuable properties beside those of dignity and elevation Being sweet and moderately exhilerating they are in their tone equally distant from the turbulence of passion and languor of inaction and by that tone are perfectly well qualified not only to revive the spirits when sunk by sensual gratification but also to relax them when overstrained in any violent pursuit Here is a remedy provided for many distresses And to be convinced of its salutary effects it will be sufficient to run over the following particulars Organic pleasures  have naturally a short duration when continued too long or indulged to excess they lose their relish and beget satiety and disgust To relieve us from that uneasiness nothing can be more happily contrived than the exhilerating pleasures of the eye and ear which take place imperceptibly without much varying the tone of mind On the other hand any intense exercise of the intellectual powers becomes painful by overstraining the mind Cessation from such exercise gives not instant relief it is necessary that the void be filled with some amusement gently relaxing the spirits  Du Bos judiciously observes that silence doth not tend to calm an agitated mind but that soft and slow music hath a fine effect  Organic pleasure which hath no relish but while we are in vigour is ill qualified for that office but the finer pleasures of sense which occupy without exhausting the mind are excellently well qualified to restore its usual tone after severe application to study or business as well as after satiety from sensual gratification  Our first perceptions are of external objects  and our first attachments are to them Organic pleasures take the lead But the mind gradually ripening relisheth more and more the pleasures of the eye and ear which approach the purely mental without exhausting the spirits and exceed the purely sensual without danger of satiety The pleasures of the eye and ear have accordingly a natural aptitude to attract us from the immoderate gratification of sensual appetite For the mind once accustomed to enjoy a variety of external objects without being conscious of the organic impression is prepared for enjoying internal objects where there cannot be an organic impression Thus the author of nature by qualifying the human mind for a succession of enjoyments from the lowest to the highest leads it by gentle steps from the most groveling corporeal pleasures for which solely it is fitted in the beginning of life to those refined and sublime pleasures which are suited to its maturity  This succession however is not governed by unavoidable necessity The God of nature offers it to us in order to advance  our happiness and it is sufficient that he hath enabled us to complete the succession Nor has he made our task disagreeable or difficult On the contrary the transition is sweet and easy from corporeal pleasures to the more refined pleasures of sense and not less so from these to the exalted pleasures of morality and religion We stand therefore engaged in honour as well as interest to second the purposes of nature by cultivating the pleasures of the eye and ear those especially that require extraordinary culture  A taste for natural objects is born with us in perfection To relish a fine countenance a rich landscape or a vivid colour culture is unnecessary The observation holds equally in natural sounds such as the singing of birds or the murmuring of a brook Nature here the artificer of the object as well as of the percipient hath suited them to each other with great accuracy But of a poem a cantata a picture and other artificial productions a true relish is not commonly attained without study and practice  such as are inspired by poetry painting sculpture music gardening and architecture This chiefly is the duty of the opulent who have leisure to improve their minds and their feelings The fine arts are contrived to give pleasure to the eye  and the ear disregarding the inferior senses A taste for these arts is a plant that grows naturally in many soils but without culture scarce to perfection in any soil It is susceptible of much refinement and is by proper care greatly improved In this respect a taste in the fine arts goes hand in hand with the moral sense to which indeed it is nearly allied Both of them discover what is right and what is wrong Fashion temper and education have an influence upon both to vitiate them or to preserve them pure and untainted Neither of them are arbitrary or local They are rooted in human nature and are governed by principles common to all men The principles of morality belong not to the present undertaking But as to the principles of the fine arts they are evolved by studying the sensitive part of human nature and by learning what objects are naturally agreeable and what are naturally disagreeable The man who aspires to be a critic in these arts must pierce still deeper He must clearly perceive what objects are lofty what low what are proper or improper what are manly  and what are mean or trivial Hence a foundation for judging of taste and for reasoning upon it Where it is conformable to principles we can pronounce with certainty that it is correct otherwise that it is incorrect and perhaps whimsical Thus the fine arts like morals become a rational science and like morals may be cultivated to a high degree of refinement  Manifold are the advantages of criticism when thus studied as a rational science In the first place a thorough acquaintance with the principles of the fine arts redoubles the entertainment these arts afford To the man who resigns himself entirely to sentiment or feeling without interposing any sort of judgment poetry music painting are mere pastime In the prime of life indeed they are delightful being supported by the force of novelty and the heat of imagination But they lose their relish gradually with their novelty and are generally neglected in the maturity of life which disposes to more serious and more important occupations To those who deal in criticism as a regular science governed by just principles  and giving scope to judgment as well as to fancy the fine arts are a favourite entertainment and in old age maintain that relish which they produce in the morning of life  "Though logic may subsist without rhetoric or poetry yet so necessary to these last is a sound and correct logic that without it they are no better than warbling trifles"  Hermes p    In the next place a philosophic inquiry into the principles of the fine arts inures the reflecting mind to the most enticing sort of logic Reasoning upon subjects so agreeable tends to a habit and a habit strengthening the reasoning faculties prepares the mind for entering into subjects more difficult and abstract To have in this respect a just conception of the importance of criticism we need but reflect upon the common method of education which after some years spent in acquiring languages hurries us without the least preparatory discipline into the most profound philosophy A more effectual method to alienate the tender mind from abstract science is beyond the reach of invention  With respect to such speculations the bulk of our youth contract a sort of hobgoblin terror which is seldom if ever subdued Those who apply to the arts are trained in a very different manner They are led step by step from the easier parts of the operation to what are more difficult and are not permitted to make a new motion till they be perfected in those which regularly precede it The science of criticism appears then to be an intermediate link finely qualified for connecting the different parts of education into a regular chain This science furnisheth an inviting opportunity to exercise the judgement we delight to reason upon subjects that are equally pleasant and familiar we proceed gradually from the simpler to the more involved cases and in a due course of discipline custom which improves all our faculties bestows acuteness upon those of reason sufficient to unravel all the intricacies of philosophy  Nor ought it to be overlooked that the reasonings employed upon the fine arts are of the same kind with those which regulate our conduct Mathematical and metaphysical  reasonings have no tendency to improve social intercourse nor are they applicable to the common affairs of life But a just taste in the fine arts derived from rational principles is a fine preparation for acting in the social state with dignity and propriety  The science of criticism tends to improve the heart not less than the understanding I observe in the first place that it hath a fine effect in moderating the selfish affections A just taste in the fine arts by sweetening and harmonizing the temper is a strong antidote to the turbulence of passion and violence of pursuit Elegance of taste procures to a man so much enjoyment at home or easily within reach that in order to be occupied he is in youth under no temptation to precipitate into hunting gaming drinking nor in middle age to deliver himself over to ambition nor in old age to avarice Pride a disgustful selfish passion exerts itself without control when accompanied with a bad taste A man of this stamp upon whom the most striking beauty makes but a faint impression  feels no joy but in gratifying his ruling passion by the discovery of errors and blemishes Pride on the other hand finds in the constitution no enemy more formidable than a delicate and discerning taste The man upon whom nature and culture have bestowed this blessing feels great delight in the virtuous dispositions and actions of others He loves to cherish them and to publish them to the world Faults and failings it is true are to him not less obvious but these he avoids or removes out of sight because they give him pain In a word there may be other passions which for a season disturb the peace of society more than pride but no other passion is so unwearied an antagonist to the sweets of social intercourse Pride tending assiduously to its gratification puts a man perpetually in opposition to others and disposes him more to relish bad than good qualities even in a bosom friend How different that disposition of mind where every virtue in a companion or neighbour is by refinement of taste set in its strongest light and defects or blemishes natural  to all are suppressed or kept out of view  In the next place delicacy of taste tends not less to invigorate the social affections than to moderate those that are selfish To be convinced of this tendency we need only reflect that delicacy of taste necessarily heightens our sensibility of pain and pleasure and of course our sympathy which is the capital branch of every social passion Sympathy in particular invites a communication of joys and sorrows hopes and fears Such exercise soothing and satisfactory in itself is productive necessarily of mutual goodwill and affection  One other advantage of criticism is reserved to the last place being of all the most important that it is a great support to morality I insist on it with entire satisfaction that no occupation attaches a man more to his duty than that of cultivating a taste in the fine arts A just relish of what is beautiful proper elegant and ornamental in writing or painting in architecture or gardening is a fine preparation for discerning what is beautiful just elegant  or magnanimous in character and behaviour To the man who has acquired a taste so acute and accomplished every action wrong or improper must be highly disgustful If in any instance the overbearing power of passion sway him from his duty he returns to it upon the first reflection with redoubled resolution never to be swayed a second time He has now an additional motive to virtue a conviction derived from experience that happiness depends on regularity and order and that a disregard to justice or propriety never fails to be punished with shame and remorse  Genius is allied to a warm and inflammable constitution delicacy of taste to calmness and sedateness Hence it is common to find genius in one who is a prey to every passion which can scarce happen with respect to delicacy of taste Upon a man possessed of this blessing the moral duties as well as the fine arts make a deep impression so as to counterbalance every irregular desire And even supposing a strong temptation it can take no fast hold of a calm and sedate temper    Rude ages exhibit the triumph of authority over reason Philosophers anciently were divided into sects they were either Epicureans Platonists Stoics Pythagoreans  or Sceptics Men relied no farther upon their own judgement than to chuse a leader whom they implicitly followed In later times happily reason hath obtained the ascendant Men now assert their native privilege of thinking for themselves and disdain to be ranked in any sect whatever be the science I must except criticism which by what fatality I know not continues to be not less slavish in its principles nor less submissive to authority than it was originally Bossu a celebrated French critic gives many rules but can discover no better foundation for any of them than the practice merely of Homer and Virgil supported by the authority of Aristotle Strange that in so long a work the concordance or discordance of these rules with human nature should never once have entered his thoughts It could not surely be his opinion that these poets however eminent for genius were intitled to give laws to mankind and that nothing now remains but blind obedience to their arbitrary will If in writing they followed no rule why should they be imitated If they studied nature and  were obsequious to rational principles why should these be concealed from us  With respect to the present undertaking it is not the author's intention to give a regular treatise upon each of the fine arts in particular but only in general to apply to them some remarks and observations drawn from human nature the true source of criticism The fine arts are calculated for our entertainment or for making agreeable impressions and by that circumstance are distinguished from the useful arts In order then to be a critic in the fine arts it is necessary as above hinted to know what objects are naturally agreeable and what naturally disagreeable A complete treatise on that subject would be a field by far too extensive to be thoroughly cultivated by any one hand The author pretends only to have entered upon the subject so far as necessary for supporting his critical remarks And he assumes no merit from his performance but that of evincing perhaps more distinctly than hitherto has been done that the genuine rules of criticism are all of them derived from the human heart The  sensitive part of our nature is a delightful speculation What the author hath discovered or collected upon that subject he chuses to impart in the gay and agreeable form of criticism because he imagines that this form will be more relished and perhaps be not less instructive than a regular and laboured disquisition His plan is to ascend gradually to principles from facts and experiments instead of beginning with the former handled abstractly and descending to the latter But though criticism be thus his only declared aim he will not disown that all along he had it in view to explain the nature of man considered as a sensitive being capable of pleasure and pain And though he flatters himself with having made some progress in that important science he is however too sensible of its extent and difficulty to undertake it professedly or to avow it as the chief purpose of the present work  To censure works not men is the just prerogative of criticism and accordingly all personal censure is here avoided unless where necessary to illustrate some general  proposition No praise is claimed on that account because censuring with a view merely to find fault is an entertainment that humanity never relishes Writers one would imagine should above all others be reserved upon that article when they lie so open to retaliation The author of this treatise far from being confident of meriting no censure entertains not even the slightest hope of such perfection Amusement was at first the sole aim of his inquiries Proceeding from one particular to another the subject grew under his hand and he was far advanced before the thought struck him that his private meditations might be publicly useful In public however he would not appear in a slovenly dress and therefore he pretends not otherwise to apologise for his errors than by observing that in a new subject not less nice than extensive errors are in some measure unavoidable Neither pretends he to justify his taste in every particular That point must be extremely clear which admits not variety of opinion and in some matters susceptible of great refinement  time is perhaps the only infallible touchstone of taste To this he appeals and to this he chearfully submits  N B  THE ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM meaning the whole is a title too assuming for this work A number of these elements or principles are here evolved but as the author is far from imagining that he has completed the list a more humble title is proper such as may express any undetermined number of parts less than the whole This he thinks is signified by the title he has chosen  viz  ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM  ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM  CHAPTER I Perceptions and ideas in a train  A MAN while awake is sensible of a continued train of objects passing in his mind It requires no activity on his part to carry on the train nor has he power to vary it by calling up an object at will  For how should this be done What object is it that we are to call up If this question can be answered the object is already in the mind and there is no occasion to exert the power If the question cannot be answered I next demand how it is possible that a voluntary power can be exerted without any view of an object to exert it upon We cannot form a conception of such a thing This argument appears to me satisfactory if it need confirmation I urge experience Whoever makes a trial will find that objects are linked together in the mind forming a connected chain and that we have not the command of any object independent of the chain  At the same time we  learn from daily experience that a train of thought is not merely casual And if it depend not upon will nor upon chance we must try to evolve by what law it is governed The subject is of importance in the science of human nature and I promise beforehand that it will be found of great importance in the fine arts  It appears that the relations by which things are linked together have a great influence in directing the train of thought and we find by experience that objects are connected in the mind precisely as they are externally Beginning then with things external we find that they are not more remarkable by their inherent properties than by their various relations We cannot any where extend our view without perceiving things connected together by certain relations One thing perceived to be a cause is connected with its several  effects some things are connected by contiguity in time others by contiguity in place some are connected by resemblance some by contrast some go before some follow Not a single thing appears solitary and altogether devoid of connection The only difference is that some are intimately connected some more slightly some near some at a distance  Experience as well as reason may satisfy us that the train of mental perceptions is in a great measure regulated by the foregoing relations Where a number of things are linked together the idea of any one suggests the rest and in this manner is a train of thoughts composed Such is the law of succession whether an original law or whether directed by some latent principle is doubtful and probably will for ever remain so This law however is not inviolable It sometimes happens though rarely that an idea presents itself to the mind without any connection so far at least as can be discovered  But though we have not the absolute command of ideas yet the Will hath a considerable  influence in directing the order of connected ideas There are few things but what are connected with many others By this means when any thing becomes an object whether in a direct survey or ideally only it generally suggests many of its connections Among these a choice is afforded We can insist upon one rejecting others and we can even insist upon what has the slightest connection Where ideas are left to their natural course they are generally continued through the strongest connections The mind extends its view to a son more readily than to a servant and more readily to a neighbour than to one living at a distance This order may be varied by Will but still within the limits of connected objects In short every train of ideas must be a chain in which the particular ideas are linked to each other We may vary the order of a natural train but not so as to dissolve it altogether by carrying on our thoughts in a loose manner without any connection So far doth our power extend and that power is sufficient for all useful purposes To give us more  power would probably be detrimental instead of being salutary  Will is not the only cause that prevents a train of thought from being continued through the strongest connections Much depends on the present tone of mind for a subject that accords with this tone is always welcome Thus in good spirits a chearful subject will be introduced by the slightest connection and one that is melancholy not less readily in low spirits Again an interesting subject is recalled from time to time by any connection indifferently strong or weak This is finely touched by Shakespear with relation to a rich cargo at sea  My wind cooling my broth  Would blow me to an ague when I thought  What harm a wind too great might do at sea  I should not see the sandy hourglass run  But I should think of shallows and of flats  And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand  Vailing her high top lower than her ribs  To kiss her burial Should I go to church  And see the holy edifice of stone  And not bethink me strait of dangerous rocks  Which touching but my gentle vessel's side  Would scatter all the spices on the stream  Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks  And in a word but now worth this  And now worth nothing  Merchant of Venice act sc  Another cause clearly distinguishable from that now mentioned hath also a considerable influence over the train of ideas In some minds of a singular frame thoughts and circumstances crowd upon each other by the slightest connection I ascribe this to a defect in the faculty of discernment A person who cannot accurately distinguish betwixt a slight connection and one that is more solid is equally affected with both Such a person must necessarily have a great command of ideas because they are introduced by any relation indifferently and the slighter relations being without number must furnish ideas without end This doctrine is in a lively manner illustrated by Shakespear  Falstaff  What is the gross sum that I owe thee  Hostess  Marry if thou wert an honest man  thyself and thy money too Thou didst swear to me on a parcelgilt goblet sitting in my Dolphin chamber at the round table by a seacoal fire on Wednesday in Whitsunweek when the Prince broke thy head for likening him to a singing man of Windsor thou didst swear to me then as I was washing thy wound to marry me and make me my Lady thy wife Canst thou deny it Did not Goodwife Keech the butcher's wife come in then and call me Gossip Quickly Coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar telling us she had a good dish of prawns whereby thou didst desire to eat some whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound And didst not thou when she was gone down stairs desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people saying that ere long they should call me Madam And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings I put thee now to thy bookoath deny it if thou canst  Second part Henry IV act sc  On the other hand a man of accurate judgement cannot have a great flow of ideas The slighter relations making no figure in his mind have no power to introduce ideas And hence it is that accurate judgement is not friendly to declamation or copious eloquence  This reasoning is confirmed by experience for it is a noted observation That a great or comprehensive memory is seldom connected with a good judgement  As an additional confirmation I appeal to another noted observation That wit and judgement are seldom united Wit consists chiefly in joining things by distant and fanciful relations which surprise because they are unexpected Such relations being of the slightest kind readily occur to that person only who makes every relation equally welcome Wit upon that account is in a good measure incompatible with solid judgement which neglecting trivial relations adheres to what are substantial and permanent Thus memory and wit are often conjoined solid judgement seldom with either  The train of thought depends not entirely upon relations another cause comes in for a share and that is the sense of order and arrangement To things of equal rank where there is no room for a preference order cannot be applied and it must be indifferent in what manner they be surveyed  witness the sheep that make a flock or the trees in a wood But in things of unequal rank order is a governing principle Thus our tendency is to view the principal subject before we descend to its accessories or ornaments and the superior before the inferior or dependent We are equally averse to enter into a minute consideration of constituent parts till the thing be first surveyed as a whole In passing from a part to the whole and from an accessory to its principal the connection is the same as in the opposite direction But a sense of order aids the transition in the latter case and a sense of disorder obstructs it in the former It needs scarce be added that in thinking or reflecting on any of these particulars and in passing from one to another ideally we are sensible of easiness or difficulty precisely as when they are set before our eyes  Our sense of order is conspicuous with respect to natural operations for it always coincides with the order of nature Thinking upon a body in motion we follow its natural course The mind falls with a heavy body descends with a river and ascends  with flame and smoke In tracing out a family we incline to begin at the founder and to descend gradually to his latest posterity On the contrary musing on a lofty oak we begin at the trunk and mount from it to the branches As to historical facts we love to proceed in the order of time or which comes to the same to proceed along the chain of causes and effects  But though in following out a historical chain our bent is to proceed orderly from causes to their effects we find not the same bent in matters of science There we seem rather disposed to proceed from effects to their causes and from particular propositions to those which are more general Why this difference in matters that appear so nearly related The cases are similar in appearance only not in reality In a historical chain every event is particular the effect of some former event and the cause of others that follow In such a chain there is nothing to bias the mind from the order of nature Widely different is the case of science when we endeavour to trace out  causes and their effects Many experiments are commonly reduced under one cause and again many of these under some one still more general and comprehensive In our progress from particular effects to general causes and from particular propositions to the more comprehensive we feel a gradual dilatation or expansion of mind like what is felt in proceeding along an ascending series which is extremely delightful The pleasure here exceeds what arises from sollowing the course of nature and it is this pleasure which regulates our train of thought in the case now mentioned and in others that are similar These observations by the way furnish materials for instituting a comparison betwixt the synthetic and analytic methods of reasoning The synthetic method descending regularly from principles to their consequences is more agreeable to the strictness of order But in following the opposite course in the analytic method we have a sensible pleasure like mounting upward which is not felt in the other The analytic method is more agreeable to the imagination The other method  will be preferred by those only who with rigidity adhere to order and give no indulgence to natural emotions  A train of perceptions or ideas with respect to its uniformity and variety is handled afterward chap    It appears then that we are framed by nature to relish order and connection When an object is introduced by a proper connection we are conscious of a certain pleasure arising from that circumstance Among objects of equal rank the pleasure is proportioned to the degree of connection but among unequal objects where we require a certain order the pleasure arises chiefly from an orderly arrangement Of this one may be made sensible in tracing objects contrary to the course of nature or contrary to our sense of order The mind proceeds with alacrity from a whole to its parts and from a principal to its accessories but in the contrary direction it is sensible of a sort of retrograde motion which is unpleasant And here may be remarked the great influence of order upon the mind of man Grandeur which makes a deep impression  inclines us in running over any series to proceed from small to great rather than from great to small But order prevails over this tendency and in passing from the whole to its parts and from a subject to its ornaments affords pleasure as well as facility which are not felt in the opposite course Elevation touches the mind not less than grandeur doth and in raising the mind to elevated objects there is a sensible pleasure But the course of nature hath still a greater influence than elevation and therefore the pleasure of falling with rain and descending gradually with a river prevails over that of mounting upward Hence the agreeableness of smoke ascending in a calm morning Elevation concurs with the course of nature to make this object delightful  I am extremely sensible of the disgust men generally have at abstract speclation and for that reason I would avoid it altogether were it possible in a work which professes to draw the rules of criticism from human nature their true source There is indeed no choice other than to continue for some  time in the same track or to abandon the undertaking altogether Candor obliges me to notify this to my readers that such of them whose aversion to abstract speculation is invincible may stop short here for till principles be explained I can promise no entertainment to those who shun thinking But I flatter myself with a different taste in the bulk of readers Some few I imagine will relish the abstract part for its own sake and many for the useful purposes to which it may be applied For encouraging the latter to proceed with alacrity I assure them beforehand that the foregoing speculation leads to many important rules of criticism which shall be unfolded in the course of this work In the mean time for instant satisfaction in part they will be pleased to accept the following specimen  It is required in every work of art that like an organic system the constituent parts be mutually connected and bear each of them a relation to the whole some more intimate some less according to their destination Order is not less essential than connection and when due regard is paid to  these we have a sense of just composition and so far are pleased with the performance Homer is defective in order and connection and Pindar more remarkably Regularity order and connection are painful restraints on a bold and fertile imagination and are not patiently submitted to but after much culture and discipline In Horace there is no fault more eminent than want of connection Instances are without number In the first fourteen lines of ode lib he mentions several towns and districts which by some were relished more than by others In the remainder of the ode Plancus is exhorted to drown his cares in wine Having narrowly escaped death by the fall of a tree this poet  Lib ode  takes occasion properly to observe that while we guard against some dangers we are exposed to others we cannot foresee He ends with displaying the power of music The parts of ode lib are so loosely connected as to disfigure a poem otherwise extremely beautiful The st d d th th th th odes of the  d book lie open all of them to the same censure The st satire book is so deformed by want of unity and connection of parts as upon the whole to be scarce agreeable It commences with an important question How it happens that persons who are so much satisfied with themselves are generally so little with their condition After illustrating the observation in a sprightly manner by several examples the author forgetting his subject enters upon a declamation against avarice which he pursues till the line There he makes an apology for wandering and promises to return to his subject But avarice having got possession of his mind he follows out that theme to the end and never returns to the question proposed in the beginning  In the Georgies of Virgil though esteemed the most finished work of that author the parts are ill connected and the transitions far from being sweet and easy In the first book  Lin  he deviates from his subject to give a description of the five  zones The want of connection here is remarkable as well as in the description of the prodigies that accompanied the death of Caesar with which the same book is concluded A digression upon the praises of Italy in the second book  Lin  is not more happily introduced And in the midst of a declamation upon the pleasures of husbandry that makes part of the same book  Lin  the author appears personally upon the stage without the slightest connection The two prefaces of Sallust look as if they had been prefixed by some blunder to his two histories They will suit any other history as well or any subject as well as history Even the members of these prefaces are but loosely connected They look more like a number of maxims or observations than a connected discourse  An episode in a narrative poem being in effect an accessory demands not that strict union with the principal subject which is requisite betwixt a whole and its constituent parts The relation however of principal  and accessory being pretty intimate an episode loosely connected with the principal subject will never be graceful I give for an example the descent of Aeneas into hell which employs the sixth book of the Aeneid The reader is not prepared for this important event No cause is assigned that can make it appear necessary or even natural to suspend for so long a time the principal action in its most interesting period To engage Aeneas to wander from his course in search of an adventure so extraordinary the poet can find no better pretext than the hero's longing to visit the ghost of his father recently dead In the mean time the story is interrupted and the reader loses his ardor An episode so extremely beautiful is not at any rate to be dispensed with It is pity however that it doth not arise more naturally from the subject I must observe at the same time that full justice is done to this incident by considering it to be an episode for if it be a constituent part of the principal action the connection ought to be still more intimate The same objection lies against that elaborate  description of Fame in the Aeneid  Lib lin  Any other book of that heroic poem or of any heroic poem has as good a title to that description as the book where it is placed  In a natural landscape we every day perceive a multitude of objects connected by contiguity solely Objects of sight make an impression so lively as that a relation even of the slightest kind is relished This however ought not to be imitated in description Words are so far short of the eye in liveliness of impression that in a description the connection of objects ought to be carefully studied in order to make the deeper impression For it is a known fact the reason of which is suggested above that it is easier by words to introduce into the mind a related object than one which is not connected with the preceding train In the following passage different things are brought together without the slightest connection if it be not what may be called verbal  i e  taking the same word in different meanings  Surgamus solet esse gravis cantantibus umbra  Juniperi gravis umbra nocent et frugibus umbrae  Ite domum saturae venit Hesperus ite capellae  Virg Buc  The metaphorical or figurative appearance of an object is no good cause for introducing that object in its real and natural appearance A relation so slight can never be relished  Distrust in lovers is too warm a sun  But yet 'tis night in love when that is gone  And in those climes which most his scorching know  He makes the noblest fruits and metals grow  Part Conquest of Granada act  The relations among objects have a considerable influence in the gratification of our passions and even in their production But this subject is reserved to be treated in the chapter of emotions and passions  Part sect    There is perhaps not another instance of a building so great erected upon a foundation so slight in appearance as that which is  erected upon the relations of objects and their arrangement Relations make no capital figure in the mind the bulk of them are transitory and some extremely trivial They are however the links that uniting our perceptions into one connected chain produce connection of action because perceptions and actions have an intimate correspondence But it is not sufficient for the conduct of life that our actions be linked together however intimately it is beside necessary that they proceed in a certain order and this also is provided for by an original propensity Thus order and connection while they admit sufficient variety introduce a method in the management of affairs Without them our conduct would be fluctuating and desultory and we would be hurried from thought to thought and from action to action entirely at the mercy of chance  CHAP II Emotions and Passions  THE fine arts as observed above  Introduction  are all of them calculated to give pleasure to the eye or the ear and they never descend to gratify the taste touch or smell At the same time the feelings of the eye and ear are of all the feelings of external sense those only which are honoured with the name of  emotions  or  passions  It is also observed above  Introduction  that the principles of the fine arts are unfolded by studying the sensitive part of human nature in order to know what objects of the eye and ear are agreeable what disagreeable These observations show the use of the present chapter We evidently must be acquainted with the nature and causes of emotions and passions before we can judge with any accuracy how far they are  under the power of the fine arts The critical art is thus set in a fine point of view The inquisitive mind beginning with criticism the most agreeable of all amusements and finding no obstruction in its progress advances far into the sensitive part of our nature and gains insensibly a thorough knowledge of the human heart of its desires and of every motive to action a science which of all that can be reached by man is to him of the greatest importance  Upon a subject so extensive all that can be expected here is a general or slight survey Some emotions indeed more peculiarly connected with the fine arts I propose to handle in separate chapters a method that will shorten the general survey considerably And yet after this circumscription so much matter comes under even a general view of the passions and emotions that to avoid confusion I find it necessary to divide this chapter into many parts in the first of which are handled the causes of those emotions and passions that are the most common and familiar for to explain  every passion and emotion however singular would be an endless work And though I could not well take up less ground without separating things intimately connected yet upon examination I find the causes of our emotions and passions to be so numerous and various as to make a subdivision also necessary by splitting this first part into several sections Human nature is a complicated machine and must be so to answer all its purposes There have indeed been published to the world many a system of human nature that flatter the mind by their simplicity But these unluckily deviate far from truth and reality According to some writers man is entirely a selfish being according to others universal benevolence is his duty One founds morality upon sympathy solely and one upon utility If any of these systems were of nature's production the present subject might be soon discussed But the variety of nature is not so easily reached and for confuting such Utopian systems without the intricacy of reasoning it appears the best method to  enter into human nature and to set before the eye plainly and candidly facts as they really exist  PART I Causes evolved of the emotions and passions  SECT I Difference betwixt emotion and passionCauses that are the most common and the most extensivePassion considered as productive of action  THese branches are so interwoven as to make it necessary that they be handled together It is a fact universally admitted that no emotion nor passion ever starts up in the mind without a known cause If I love a person it is for good qualities or good offices if I have resentment against a man it must be for some injury he has done me and I cannot pity any one who is under no distress of body or of mind  The circumstances now mentioned if they cause or occasion a passion cannot be entirely indifferent if they were they could not move us in any degree And we find upon examination that they are not indifferent Looking back upon the foregoing examples the good qualities or good offices that attract my love are antecedently agreeable If an injury were not disagreeable it would not occasion any resentment against the author nor would the passion of pity be raised by an object in distress if that object did not give us pain These feelings antecedent to passion and which seem to be the causes of passion shall be distinguished by the name of  emotions  What is now said about the production of passion resolves into a very simple proposition That we love what is pleasant and hate what is painful And indeed it is evident that without antecedent emotions we could not have any passions for a thing must be pleasant or painful before it can be the object either of love or of hatred  As it appears from this short sketch that passions are generated by means of prior emotions  it will be necessary to take first under consideration emotions and their causes  Such is the constitution of our nature that upon perceiving certain external objects we are instantaneously conscious of pleasure or pain A flowing river a smooth extended plain a spreading oak a towering hill are objects of sight that raise pleasant emotions A barren heath a dirty marsh a rotten carcass raise painful emotions Of the emotions thus produced we inquire for no other cause but merely the presence of the object  It must further be observed that the things now mentioned raise emotions by means of their properties and qualities To the emotion raised by a large river its size its force and its fluency contribute each a share The pleasures of regularity propriety convenience compose the emotion raised by a fine building  If external properties make a being or thing agreeable we have reason to expect the same effect from those which are internal and accordingly power discernment  wit mildness sympathy courage benevolence render the possessor agreeable in a high degree So soon as these qualities are perceived in any person we instantaneously feel pleasant emotions without the slightest act of reflection or of attention to consequences It is almost unnecessary to add that certain qualities opposite to the former such as dullness peevishness inhumanity cowardice occasion in the same manner painful emotions  Sensible beings affect us remarkably by their actions Some actions so soon as perceived raise pleasant emotions in the spectator without the least reflection such as graceful motion and genteel behaviour But as the intention of the agent is a capital circumstance in the bulk of human actions it requires reflection to discover their true character If I see one delivering a purse of money to another I can make nothing of this action till I discover with what intention the money is given If it be given to extinguish a debt the action is agreeable in a slight degree If it be a grateful return I feel a stronger emotion and the pleasurable  emotion rises to a great height when it is the intention of the giver to relieve a virtuous family from want Actions are thus qualified by the intention of the agent But they are not qualified by the event for an action well intended is agreeable whatever be the consequence The pleasant or painful emotion that ariseth from contemplating human actions is of a peculiar kind Human actions are perceived to be  right  or  wrong  and this perception qualifies the pleasure or pain that results from them  In tracing our emotions and passions to their origin it once was my opinion that qualities and actions are the primary causes of emotions and that these emotions are afterward expanded upon the being to which these qualities and actions belong But I have discovered that opinion to be erroneous An attribute is not even in imagination separable from the being to which it belongs and for that reason cannot of itself be the cause of any emotion We have it is true no knowledge of any being or substance but by means of its attributes and therefore no being can be agreeable to us otherwise than by their means But still when an emotion is raised it is the being itself as we apprehend the matter which raises the emotion and it raises it by means of one or other of its attributes If it be urged That we can in idea abstract a quality from the thing to which it belongs it might be answered That an abstract idea which serves excellently the purposes of reasoning is too faint and too much strained to produce any sort of emotion But it is sufficient for the present purpose to answer That the eye never abstracts By this organ we perceive things as they really exist and never perceive a quality as separated from the subject Hence it must be evident that emotions are raised not by qualities abstractly considered but by the substance or body so and so qualified Thus a spreading oak raises a pleasant emotion by means of its colour figure umbrage  c  It is not the colour strictly speaking that produces the emotion but the tree as coloured it is not the figure abstractly considered that produces the emotion but the tree considered as of a certain figure And hence by the way it appears that the beauty of such an object is complex resolvable into several beauties more simple    Not only are emotions raised in us by the qualities and actions of others but also by their feelings I cannot behold a man in distress without partaking of his pain nor in joy without partaking of his pleasure  The beings or things above described occasion emotions in us not only in the original survey but when they are recalled to the memory in idea A field laid out with taste is pleasant in the recollection as well as when under our eye A generous action described in words or colours occasions a sensible emotion as well as when we see  it performed And when we reflect upon the distress of any person our pain is of the same kind with what we felt when eyewitnesses In a word an agreeable or disagreeable object recalled to the mind in idea is the occasion of a pleasant or painful emotion of the same kind with that produced when the object was present The only difference is that an idea being fainter than an original perception the pleasure or pain produced by the former is proportionably fainter than that produced by the latter  Having explained the nature of an emotion and mentioned several causes by which it is produced we proceed to an observation of considerable importance in the science of human nature that some emotions are accompanied with desire and that others after a short existence pass away without producing desire of any sort The emotion raised by a fine landscape or a magnificent building vanisheth generally without attaching our hearts to the object which also happens with relation to a number of fine faces in a crowded assembly But the bulk of emotions are accompanied with desire of  one sort or other provided only a fit object for desire be suggested This is remarkably the case of emotions raised by human actions and qualities A virtuous action raiseth in every spectator a pleasant emotion which is generally attended with a desire to do good to the author of the action A vicious action on the other hand produceth a painful emotion and of consequence a desire to have the author punished Even things inanimate often raise desire The goods of fortune are objects of desire almost universally and the desire when more than commonly vigorous obtains the name of  avarice  The pleasant emotion produced in a spectator by a capital picture in the possession of a prince seldom raiseth desire But if such a picture be exposed to sale desire of having or possessing is the natural consequence of the emotion  If now an emotion be sometimes productive of desire somtimes not it comes to be a material inquiry in what respect a passion differs from an emotion Is passion in its nature or feeling distinguishable from emotion I have been apt to think that  there must be a distinction when the emotion seems in all cases to precede the passion and to be the cause or occasion of it But after the strictest examination I cannot perceive any such distinction betwixt emotion and passion What is love to a mistress for example but a pleasant emotion raised by a sight or idea of the person beloved joined with desire of enjoyment In what else consists the passion of resentment but in a painful emotion occasioned by the injury accompanied with desire to chastise the author of the injury In general as to every sort of passion we find no more in the composition but the particulars now mentioned an emotion pleasant or painful accompanied with desire What then shall we say upon this subject Are  passion  and  emotion  synonymous terms This cannot be averred No feeling nor agitation of the mind void of desire is termed a passion and we have discovered that there are many emotions which pass away without raising desire of any kind How is the difficulty to be solved There appears to me but one solution which I relish the more  as it renders the doctrine of the passions and emotions simple and perspicuous The solution follows An internal motion or agitation of the mind when it passeth away without raising desire is denominated  an emotion  when desire is raised the motion or agitation is denominated  a passion  A fine face for example raiseth in me a pleasant feeling If this feeling vanish without producing any effect it is in proper language an emotion But if such feeling by reiterated views of the object become sufficiently strong to raise desire it is no longer termed an emotion but a passion The same holds in all the other passions The painful feeling raised in a spectator by a slight injury done to a stranger being accompanied with no desire of revenge is termed an emotion But this injury raiseth in the stranger a stronger emotion which being accompanied with desire of revenge is a passion Again external expressions of distress produce in the spectator a painful feeling This feeling is sometimes so slight as to pass away without any effect in which case it is an emotion But if the  feeling be so strong as to prompt desire of affording relief it is a passion and is termed  pity  Envy is emulation in excess If the exaltation of a competitor be barely disagreeable the painful feeling is reckoned an emotion If it produce desire to depress him it is reckoned a passion  To prevent mistakes it must be observed that desire here is taken in its proper sense  viz  that internal impulse which makes us proceed to action Desire in a lax sense respects also actions and events that depend not on us as when I desire that my friend may have a son to represent him or that my country may flourish in arts and sciences But such internal act is more properly termed a  wish  than a  desire  Having distinguished passion from emotion we proceed to consider passion more at large with respect especially to its power of producing action  We have daily and constant experience for our authority that no man ever proceeds to action but through the impulse of some antecedent desire So well established is this observation and so deeply rooted in  the mind that we can scarce imagine a different system of action Even a child will say familiarly What should make me do this or that when I have no inclination to it Taking it then for granted that the existence of action depends on antecedent desire it follows that where there is no desire there can be no action This opens another shining distinction betwixt emotions and passions The former being without desire are in their nature quiescent the latter involving desire have a tendency to action and always produce action where they meet with no obstruction  Hence it follows that every passion must have an object  viz  that being or thing to which our desire is directed and with a view to which every action prompted by that desire is performed The object of every passion is that being or thing which produced it This will be evident from induction A fine woman by her beauty causes in me the passion of love which is directed upon her as its object A man by injuring me raises my resentment and becomes thereby the object of my resentment  Thus the cause of a passion and its object are the same in different views An emotion on the other hand being in its nature quiescent and merely a passive feeling must have a cause but cannot be said properly speaking to have an object  As the desire involved in every passion leads to action this action is either ultimate or it is done as a means to some end Where the action is ultimate reason and reflection bear no part The action is performed blindly by the impulse of passion without any view Thus one in extreme hunger snatches at food without the slightest reflection whether it be salutary or not Avarice prompts to accumulate wealth without the least view of use and thereby absurdly converts means into an end Fear often makes us fly before we reflect whether we really be in danger and animal love not less often hurries to fruition without a single thought of gratification But for the most part actions are performed as means to some end and in these actions reason and reflection always bear a part  The end is that event which is desired and the action is deliberately performed in order to bring about that end Thus affection to my friend involves a desire to make him happy and the desire to accomplish that end prompts me to perform what I judge will contribute to it  Where the action is ultimate it hath a cause  viz  the impulse of the passion But we cannot properly say it hath a motive This term is appropriated to actions that are performed as means to some end and the conviction that the action will tend to bring about the end desired is termed a motive Thus passions considered as causes of action are distinguished into two kinds instinctive and deliberative The first operating blindly and by mere impulse depend entirely upon the sensitive part of our nature The other operating by reflection and by motives are connected with the rational part  The foregoing difference among the passions is the work of nature Experience brings on some variations By all actions performed through the impulse of passion desire  is gratified and the gratification is pleasant This lesson we have from experience And hence it is that after an action has often been performed by the impulse merely of passion the pleasure resulting from performance considered beforehand becomes a motive which joins its force with the original impulse in determining us to act Thus a child eats by the mere impulse of hunger a young man thinks of the pleasure of gratification which is a motive for him to eat and a man farther advanced in life hath the additional motive that it will contribute to his health  Instinctive passions are distinguished into two kinds Where the cause is internal they are denominated  appetites  where external they retain the common name of  passions  Thus hunger thirst animal love are termed  appetites  while fear and anger even when they operate blindly and by mere impulse are termed  passions  From the definition of a motive above given it is easy to determine with the greatest accuracy what passions are selfish what social No passion can properly be  termed selfish but what prompts me to exert actions in order for my own good nor social but what prompts me to exert actions in order for the good of another The motive is that which determines a passion to be social or selfish Hence it follows that our appetites which make us act blindly and by mere impulse cannot be reckoned either social or selfish and as little the actions they produce Thus eating when prompted by an impulse merely of nature is neither social nor selfish But add a motive That it will contribute to my pleasure or my health and it becomes in a measure selfish On the other hand when affection moves me to exert actions to the end solely of advancing my friend's happiness without the slightest regard to my own gratification such actions are justly denominated  social  and so is the affection that is their cause If another motive be added That gratifying the affection will contribute to my own happiness the actions I perform become partly selfish Animal love when exerted into action by natural impulse singly is neither social nor selfish when exerted with a view to gratification  and in order to make me happy it is selfish When the motive of giving pleasure to its object is superadded it is partly social partly selfish A just action when prompted by the love of justice solely is neither social nor selfish When I perform an act of justice with a view to the pleasure of gratification the action is selfish I pay my debt for my own sake not with a view to benefit my creditor But let me suppose the money has been advanced by a friend without interest purely to oblige me In this case together with the inclination to do justice there arises a motive of gratitude which respects the creditor solely and prompts me to act in order to do him good Here the action is partly social partly selfish Suppose again I meet with a surprising and unexpected act of generosity that inspires me with love to my benefactor and the utmost gratitude I burn to do him good he is the sole object of my desire and my own pleasure in gratifying the desire vanisheth out of sight In this case the action I perform is purely social Thus it happens that when a social motive becomes strong the action is exerted  with a view singly to the object of the passion and the selfish pleasure arising from gratification is never once considered The same effect of stifling selfish motives is equally remarkable in other passions that are in no view social Ambition for example when confined to exaltation as its ultimate end is neither social nor selfish Let exaltation be considered as a means to make me happy and the passion becomes so far selfish But if the desire of exaltation wax strong and inflame my mind the selfish motive now mentioned is no longer felt A slight degree of resentment where my chief view in acting is the pleasure arising to myself from gratifying the passion is justly denominated  selfish  Where revenge flames so high as to have no other aim but the destruction of its object it is no longer selfish In opposition to a social passion it may be termed  dissocial  When this analysis of human nature is considered not one article of which can with any shadow of truth be controverted I cannot help being surprised at the blindness of some philosophers who by dark and confused notions are led to deny all motives to action but what arise from selflove Man for ought appears might possibly have been so framed as to be susceptible of no passions but what have self for their object But man thus framed would be ill fitted for society Much better is the matter ordered by enduing him with passions directed entirely to the good of others as well as with passions directed entirely to his own good    Of self every one hath a direct perception of other things we have no knowledge but by means of their attributes Hence it is that of self the perception is more lively than of any other thing Self is an agreeable object and for the reason now given must be more agreeable than any other object Is not this sufficient to account for the prevalence of selflove  In the foregoing part of this chapter it is suggested that some circumstances make beings or things fit objects for desire others not This hint must be pursued It is a truth ascertained by universal experience that a thing which in our apprehension is beyond reach never is the object of desire No man in his right senses desires to walk in the air or to descend to the centre of the earth We may amuse ourselves in a reverie with building castles in the air and  wishing for what can never happen But such things never move desire And indeed a desire to act would be altogether absurd when we are conscious that the action is beyond our power In the next place though the difficulty of attainment with respect to things within reach often inflames desire yet where the prospect of attainment is faint and the event extremely uncertain the object however agreeable seldom raiseth any strong desire Thus beauty or other good qualities in a woman of rank seldom raises love in any man greatly her inserior In the third place different objects equally within reach raise emotions in different degrees and when desire accompanies any of these emotions its strength as is natural is proportioned to that of its cause Hence the remarkable difference among desires directed upon beings inanimate animate and rational The emotion caused by a rational being is out of measure stronger than any caused by an animal without reason and an emotion raised by such an animal is stronger than what is caused by any thing inanimate There is a  separate reason why desire of which a rational being is the object should be the strongest Desire directed upon such a being is gratified many ways by loving serving benefiting the object and it is a well known truth that our desires naturally swell by exercise Desire directed upon an inanimate being susceptible neither of pleasure nor pain is not capable of a higher gratification than that of acquiring the property Hence it is that though every feeling which raiseth desire is strictly speaking a passion yet commonly those feelings only are denominated passions of which sensible beings capable of pleasure and pain are the objects  SECT II Causes of the emotions of joy and sorrow  THis subject was purposely reserved for a separate section because it could not with perspicuity be handled under the general head An emotion involving desire is termed  a passion  and when the desire is  fulfilled the passion is said to be gratified The gratification of every passion must be pleasant or in other words produce a pleasant emotion for nothing can be more natural than that the accomplishment of any wish or desire should affect us with joy I cannot even except the case where a man through remorse is desirous to chastise and punish himself The joy of gratification is properly called an emotion because it makes us happy in our present situation and is ultimate in its nature not having a tendency to any thing beyond On the other hand sorrow must be the result of an event contrary to what we desire for if the accomplishment of desire produce joy it is equally natural that disappointment should produce sorrow  An event fortunate or unfortunate that falls out by accident without being foreseen or thought of and which therefore could not be the object of desire raiseth an emotion of the same kind with that now mentioned But the cause must be different for there can be no gratification where there is no desire We have not however far to  seek for a cause A man cannot be indifferent to an event that affects him or any of his connections If it be fortunate it gives him joy if unfortunate it gives him sorrow  In no situation doth joy rise to a greater height than upon the removal of any violent distress of mind or body and in no situation doth sorrow rise to a greater height than upon the removal of what makes us happy The sensibility of our nature serves in part to account for these effects Other causes also concur We can be under no violent distress without an anxious desire to be free from it and therefore its removal is a high gratification We cannot be possessed of any thing that makes us happy without wishing its continuance and therefore its removal by crossing our wishes must create sorrow Nor is this all The principle of contrast comes in for its share An emotion of joy arising upon the removal of pain is increased by contrast when we reflect upon our former distress En emotion of sorrow upon being deprived of any good is increased  by contrast when we reflect upon our former happiness  Jaffier  There's not a wretch that lives on common charity  But's happier than me For I have known  The luscious sweets of plenty every night  Have slept with soft content about my head  And never wak'd but to a joyful morning  Yet now must fall like a full ear of corn  Whose blossom 'scap'd yet's wither'd in the ripening  Venice preserv'd act sc  It hath always been reckoned difficult to account for the extreme pleasure that follows a cessation of bodily pain as when one is relieved from the rack or from a violent fit of the stone What is said explains this difficulty in the easiest and simplest manner Cessation of bodily pain is not of itself a pleasure for a  nonens  or a negative can neither give pleasure nor pain But man is so framed by nature as to rejoice when he is eased of pain as well as to be sorrowful when deprived of any good This branch of our constitution is chiefly the  cause of the pleasure The gratification of desire comes in as an accessory cause and contrast joins its force by increasing the sense of our present happiness In the case of an acute pain a peculiar circumstance contributes its part The brisk circulation of the animal spirits occasioned by acute pain continues after the pain is vanished and produceth a very pleasant feeling Sickness hath not that effect because it is always attended with a depression of spirits  Hence it is that the gradual diminution of acute pain occasions a mixt emotion partly pleasant partly painful The partial diminution produceth joy in proportion but the remaining pain balanceth our joy This mixt feeling however hath no long endurance For the joy that ariseth upon the diminution of pain soon vanisheth and leaveth in the undisturbed possession that degree of pain which remains  What is above observed about bodily pain is equally applicable to the distresses of the mind and accordingly it is a common artifice to prepare us for the reception of good news by alarming our fears  SECT III Sympathetic emotion of virtue and its cause  ONE feeling there is that merits a deliberate view for its singularity as well as utility Whether to call it an emotion or a passion seems uncertain The former it can scarce be because it involves desire and the latter it can scarce be because it has no object But this feeling and its nature will be best understood from examples A signal act of gratitude produceth in the spectator love or esteem for the author The spectator hath at the same time a separate feeling which being mixed with love or esteem the capital emotion hath not been much adverted to It is a vague feeling of gratitude which hath no object but which however disposes the spectator to acts of gratitude more than upon ordinary occasions Let any man attentively consider his own heart when he thinks warmly of any signal act of gratitude and he will be conscious of this feeling as distinct from  the esteem or admiration he has for the grateful person It merits our utmost attention by unfolding a curious piece of mechanism in the nature of man The feeling is singular in the following respect that it involves a desire to perform acts of gratitude without having any particular object though in this state the mind wonderfully disposed toward an object neglects no object upon which it can vent itself Any act of kindness or goodwill that would not be regarded upon another occasion is greedily seized and the vague feeling is converted into a real passion of gratitude In such a state favours are returned double  Again a courageous action produceth in a spectator the passion of admiration directed upon the author But beside this wellknown passion a separate feeling is raised in the spectator which may be called  an emotion of courage  because while under its influence he is conscious of a boldness and intrepidity beyond ordinary and longs for proper objects upon which to exert this emotion  Spumantemque dari pecora inter inertia votis  Optat aprum aut fulvum descendere monte leonem  Aeneid iv  Non altramente 'il tauro oue l' irriti  Geloso amor con stimoli pungenti  Horribilmente mugge e co' muggiti  Gli spirti in se risueglia e l'ire ardenti  E'l corno aguzza a i tronchi e par ch'inuiti  Con vani colpi a'la battaglia i venti  Tasso canto st  So full of valour that they smote the air  For breathing in their faces  Tempest act sc  For another example let us figure some grand and heroic action highly agreeable to the spectator Beside a singular veneration for the author the spectator feels in himself an unusual dignity of character which disposeth him to great and noble actions And herein principally consists the extreme delight every one hath in the histories of conquerors and heroes  This singular feeling which may be termed  the sympathetic emotion of virtue  resembles  in one respect the wellknown appetites that lead to the propagation and preservation of the species The appetites of hunger thirst and animal love arise in the mind without being directed upon any particular object and in no case whatever is the mind more solicitous for a proper object than when under the influence of any of these appetites  The feeling I have endeavoured to evolve may well be termed  the sympathetic emotion of virtue  for it is raised in a spectator by virtuous actions of every kind and by no other sort When we contemplate a virtuous action which never fails to delight us and to prompt our love for the author the mind is warmed and put into a tone similar to what inspired the virtuous action The propensity we have to such actions is so much enlivened as to become for a time an actual emotion But no man hath a propensity to vice as such On the contrary a wicked deed disgusts him and makes him abhor the author This abhorrence is a strong antidote so long as  any impression remains of the wicked action  In a rough road a halt to view a fine country is refreshing and here a delightful prospect opens upon us It is indeed wonderful to see what incitements there are to virtue in the human frame Justice is perceived to be our duty and it is guarded by natural punishments from which the guilty never escape To perform noble and generous actions a warm sense of dignity and superior excellence is a most efficacious incitement  See Essays upon morality and natural religion part essay ch  And to leave virtue in no quarter unsupported here is unfolded an admirable contrivance by which good example commands the heart and adds to virtue the force of habit Did our moral feelings extend no farther than to approve the action and to bestow our affection on the author good example would not have great influence But to give it the utmost force nothing can be better contrived than the sympathetic emotion under consideration  which prompts us to imitate what we admire This singular emotion will readily find an object to exert itself upon and at any rate it never exists without producing some effect Virtuous emotions of this sort are in some degree an exercise of virtue They are a mental exercise at least if they show not externally And every exercise of virtue internal and external leads to habit for a disposition or propensity of the mind like a limb of the body becomes stronger by exercise Proper means at the same time being ever at hand to raise this sympathetic emotion its frequent reiteration may in a good measure supply the want of a more complete exercise Thus by proper discipline every person may acquire a settled habit of virtue Intercourse with men of worth histories of generous and disinterested actions and frequent meditation upon them keep the sympathetic emotion in constant exercise which by degrees introduceth a habit and confirms the authority of virtue With respect to education in particular what a spacious and commodious avenue to the heart of a young person is here opened  SECT IV In many instances one emotion is productive of another The same of passions  IN the first chapter it is observed that the relations by which things are mutually connected have a remarkable influence in regulating the train of our ideas I here add that they have an influence not less remarkable in generating emotions and passions Beginning with the former it holds in fact that an agreeable object makes every thing connected with it appear agreeable The mind gliding sweetly and easily through related objects carries along the beauty of objects that made a figure and blends that beauty with the idea of the present object which thereby appears more agreeable than when considered apart  Such proneness has the mind to this communication of properties that we often find properties ascribed to a related object of which naturally it is not susceptible Sir Richard Greenville in a single ship being surprised by the Spanish fleet was advised to retire He utterly refused to turn from the enemy declaring  "he would rather die than dishonour himself his country and her Majesty's ship"  Hakluyt vol part p  To aid the communication of properties in such instances there always must be a momentary personification A ship must be imagined a sensible being to make it susceptible of honour or dishonour In the battle of Mantinea Epaminondas being mortally wounded was carried to his tent in a manner dead Recovering his senses the first thing he inquired about was his shield which being brought he kissed it as the companion of his valour and glory It must be remarked that among the Greeks and Romans it was deemed infamous for a soldier to return from battle without his shield    This reason may appear obscure and metaphysical but it must be relished when we attend to the following examples which establish the fact beyond all dispute No relation is more intimate than that betwixt a being and its qualities and accordingly the affection I bear a man expands itself readily upon all his qualities which by that means make a greater figure in my mind than more substantial qualities in others The talent of speaking in a friend is more regarded than that of acting in a person with whom I have no connection and graceful motion in a mistress gives more delight than consummate prudence in any other woman Affection sometimes rises so high  as to convert defects into properties The wry neck of Alexander was imitated by his courtiers as a real beauty without intention to flatter Thus Lady Piercy speaking of her husband Hotspur  By his light  Did all the chivalry of England move  To do brave acts He was indeed the glass  Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves  He had no legs that practis'd not his gait  And speaking thick which Nature made his blemish  Became the accents of the valiant  For those who could speak low and tardily  Would turn their own perfection to abuse  To seem like him  Second part Henry IV act sc  When the passion of love has ended its course its object becomes quite a different creatureNothing left of that genteel motion that gaiety that sprightly conversation those numberless graces that formerly in the lover's opinion charmed all hearts  The same communication of passion obtains  in the relation of principal and accessory Pride of which self is the object expands itself upon a house a garden servants equipage and every thing of that nature A lover addresseth his mistress's glove in the following terms  Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine  A temple is in a proper sense an accessory of the deity to which it is dedicated Diana is chaste and not only her temple but the very isicle which hangs on it must partake of that property  The noble sister of Poplicola  The moon of Rome chaste as the isicle  That's curdled by the frost from purest snow  And hangs on Dian's temple  Coriolanus act sc  Thus it is that the respect and esteem which the great the powerful the opulent naturally command are in some measure communicated to their dress to their manners and to all their connections It is this  principle which in matters left to our own choice prevails over the natural taste of beauty and propriety and gives currency to what is called  the fashion  By means of the same easiness of transition the bad qualities of an object are carried along and grafted upon related objects Every good quality in a person is extinguished by hatred and every bad quality is spread upon all his connections A relation more slight and transitory than that of hatred may have the same effect Thus the bearer of bad tidings becomes an object of aversion  Fellow begone I cannot brook thy sight  This news hath made thee a most ugly man  King John act sc  Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news  Hath but a losing office and his tongue  Sounds ever after as a sullen bell  Remember'd tolling a departing friend  Second part Henry IV act sc  This disposition of the mind to communicate the properties of one object to another  is not always proportioned to the intimacy of their connection The order of the transition from object to object hath also an influence The sense of order operates not less powerfully in this case than in the succession of ideas  See chap  If a thing be agreeable in itself all its accessories appear agreeable But the agreeableness of an accessory extends not itself so readily to the principal Any dress upon a fine woman is becoming but the most elegant ornaments upon one that is homely have scarce any effect to mend her appearance The reason will be obvious from what is said in the chapter above cited The mind passes more easily from the principal to its accessories than in the opposite direction  The emotions produced as above may properly be termed  secondary  being occasioned either by antecedent emotions or antecedent passions which in this respect may be termed  primary  And to complete the present theory I must now remark a difference betwixt a primary emotion and a  primary passion in the production of secondary emotions A secondary emotion cannot but be more faint than the primary and therefore if the chief or principal object have not the power to raise a passion the accessory object will have still less power But if a passion be raised by the principal object the secondary emotion may readily swell into a passion for the accessory provided the accessory be a proper object for desire And thus it happens that one passion is often productive of another Examples are without number the sole difficulty is a proper choice I begin with selflove and the power it hath to generate other passions The love which parents bear their children is an illustrious example of the foregoing doctrine Every man beside making part of a greater system like a comet a planet or satellite only hath a less system of his own in the centre of which he represents the sun dispersing his fire and heat all around The connection between a man and his children fundamentally that of cause and effect becomes by the addition of other circumstances the completest that can  be among individuals and therefore selflove the most vigorous of all passions is readily expanded upon children The secondary emotion they at first produce by means of their connection is generally speaking sufficiently strong to move desire even from the beginning and the new passion swells by degrees till it rival in some measure selflove the primary passion The following case will demonstrate the truth of this theory Remorse for betraying a friend or murdering an enemy in cold blood makes a man even hate himself In this state it is a matter of experience that he is scarce conscious of any affection to his children but rather of disgust or illwill What cause can be assigned for this change other than the hatred which beginning at himself is expanded upon his children And if so may we not with equal reason derive from selflove the affection a man for ordinary has to them  The affection a man bears to his bloodrelations depends on the same principle Selflove is also expanded upon them and the communicated passion is more or less  vigorous in proportion to the connection Nor doth selflove rest here it is by the force of connection communicated even to things inanimate And hence the affection a man bears to his property and to every thing he calls his own  Friendship less vigorous than selflove is for that reason less apt to communicate itself to children or other relations Instances however are not wanting of such communicated passion arising from friendship when it is strong Friendship may go higher in the matrimonial state than in any other condition and Otway in  Venice preserv'd  shows a fine taste in taking advantage of that circumstance In the scene where Belvidera sues to her father for pardon she is represented as pleading her mother's merit and the resemblance she bore to her mother  Priuli  My daughter  Belvidera  Yes your daughter by a mother  Virtuous and noble faithful to your honour  Obedient to your will kind to your wishes  Dear to your arms By all the joys she gave you  When in her blooming years she was your treasure  Look kindly on me in my face behold  The lineaments of hers y' have kiss'd so often  Pleading the cause of your poor castoff child  And again  Belvidera  Lay me I beg you lay me  By the dear ashes of my tender mother  She would have pitied me had fate yet spar'd her  Act sc  This explains why any meritorious action or any illustrious qualification in my son or my friend is apt to make me overvalue myself If I value my friend's wife or his son upon account of their connection with him it is still more natural that I should value myself upon account of my own connection with him  Friendship or any other social affection may produce opposite effects Pity by interesting us strongly for the person in distress must of consequence inflame our resentment against the author of the distress For in general the affection we have for any man  generates in us goodwill to his friends and illwill to his enemies Shakespear shows great art in the funeral oration pronounced by Antony over the body of Caesar He first endeavours to excite grief in the hearers by dwelling upon the deplorable loss of so great a man This passion raised to a pitch interesting them strongly in Caesar's fate could not fail to produce a lively sense of the treachery and cruelty of the conspirators an infallible method to inflame the resentment of the multitude beyond all bounds  Antony  If you have tears prepare to shed them now  You all do know this mantle I remember  The first time ever Caesar put it on  'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent  That day he overcame the Nervii  Look in this place ran Cassius' dagger through  See what a rent the envious Casca made  Through this the wellbeloved Brutus stabb'd  And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away  Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it  As rushing out of doors to be resolv'd  If Brutus so unkindly knock'd or no  For Brutus as you know was Caesar's angel  Judge oh you gods how dearly Caesar lov'd him  This this was the unkindest cut of all  For when the noble Caesar saw him stab  Ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms  Quite vanquish'd him then burst his mighty heart  And in his mantle muffling up his face  Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell  Even at the base of Pompey's statue  O what a fall was there my countrymen  Then I and you and all of us fell down  Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us  O now you weep and I perceive you feel  The dint of pity these are gracious drops  Kind souls what weep you when you but behold  Our Caesar's vesture wounded look you here  Here is himself marr'd as you see by traitors  Julius Caesar act sc  Had Antony directed upon the conspirators the thoughts of his audience without paving the way by raising their grief his speech perhaps might have failed of success  Hatred and other dissocial passions produce effects directly opposite to those above mentioned If I hate a man his children his relations nay his property become to  me objects of aversion His enemies on the other hand I am disposed to esteem  The more slight and transitory connections have generally no power to produce a communicated passion Anger when sudden and violent is one exception for if the person who did the injury be removed out of reach this passion will vent itself upon any related object however slight the relation be Another exception makes a greater figure A group of beings or things becomes often the object of a communicated passion even where the relation of the individuals to the principal object is but faint Thus though I put no value upon a single man for living in the same town with myself my townsmen however considered in a body are preferred before others This is still more remarkable with respect to my countrymen in general The grandeur of the complex object swells the passion of selflove by the relation I have to my native country and every passion when it swells beyond its ordinary bounds hath in that circumstance a peculiar tendency to expand itself along related  objects In fact instances are not rare of persons who upon all occasions are willing to sacrifice their lives and fortunes for their country Such influence upon the mind of man hath a complex object or more properly speaking a general term  See Essays on morality and natural religion part ess ch    The sense of order hath in the communication of passion an influence not less remarkable than in the communication of emotions It is a common observation that a man's affection to his parents is less vigorous than to his children The order of nature in descending to children aids the transition of the affection The ascent to a parent contrary to this order makes the transition more difficult Gratitude to a benefactor is readily extended to his children but not so readily to his parents The difference however betwixt the natural and inverted order is not so considerable but that it may be balanced by other circumstances Pliny  Lib cap  gives an account of a woman of rank condemned  to die for a crime and to avoid public shame detained in prison to die of hunger Her life being prolonged beyond expectation it was discovered that she was nourished by sucking milk from the breasts of her daughter This instance of filial piety which aided the transition and made ascent not less easy than descent is for ordinary procured a pardon to the mother and a pension to both The story of Androcles and the lion  Aulus Gelliu lib cap  may be accounted for in the same manner The admiration of which the lion was the cause for his kindness and gratitude to Androcles produced goodwill to Androcles and pardon of his crime  And this leads to other observations upon communicated passions I love my daughter less after she is married and my mother less after a second marriage The marriage of my son or my father diminishes not my affection so remarkably The same observation holds with respect to friendship gratitude and other passions The love I bear my friend is but faintly extended to his married daughter The resentment I have  against a man is readily extended against children who make part of his family not so readily against children who are forisfamiliated especially by marriage This difference is also more remarkable in daughters than in sons These are curious facts and to evolve the cause we must examine minutely that operation of the mind by which a passion is extended to a related object In considering two things as related the mind is not stationary but passeth and repasseth from the one to the other viewing the relation from each of them perhaps oftener than once This holds more especially in considering a relation betwixt things of unequal rank as betwixt the cause and the effect or betwixt a principal and an accessory In contemplating the relation betwixt a building and its ornaments the mind is not satisfied with a single transition from the former to the latter It must also view the relation beginning at the latter and passing from it to the former This vibration of the mind in passing and repassing betwixt things that are related explains the facts above mentioned  The mind passeth easily from the father to the daughter but where the daughter is married this new relation attracts the mind and obstructs in some measure the return from the daughter to the father Any obstruction the mind meets with in passing and repassing betwixt its objects occasions a like obstruction in the communication of passion The marriage of a male obstructs less the easiness of transition because a male is less sunk by the relation of marriage than a female  The foregoing instances are of passion communicated from one object to another But one passion may be generated by another without change of object It may in general be observed that a passion paves the way to others similar in their tone whether directed upon the same or upon a different object For the mind heated by any passion is in that state more susceptible of a new impression in a similar tone than when cool and quiescent It is a common observation that pity generally produceth friendship for a person in distress  Pity interests us in its object and recommends all its virtuous qualities For this reason female beauty shows best in distress and is more apt to inspire love than upon ordinary occasions But it is chiefly to be remarked that pity warming and melting the spectator prepares him for the reception of other tender affections and pity is readily improved into love or friendship by a certain tenderness and concern for the object which is the tone of both passions The aptitude of pity to produce love is beautifully illustrated by Shakespear  Othello  Her father lov'd me oft invited me  Still question'd me the story of my life  From year to year the battles sieges fortunes  That I have past  I ran it through e'en from my boyish days  To th'very moment that he bad me tell it  Wherein I spoke of most disast'rous chances  Of moving accidents by flood and field  Of hairbreadth 'scapes in th' imminent deadly breach  Of being taken by the insolent foe  And sold to slavery of my redemption thence  And with it all my travel's history  All these to hear  Would Desdemona seriously incline  But still the houseaffairs would draw her thence  Which ever as she could with haste dispatch  She'd come again and with a greedy ear  Devour up my discourse which I observing  Took once a pliant hour and found good means  To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart  That I would all my pilgrimage dilate  Whereof by parcels she had something heard  But not distinctively I did consent  And often did beguile her of her tears  When I did speak of some distressful stroke  That my youth suffer'd My story being done  She gave me for my pains a world of sighs  She swore in faith 'twas strange 'twas passing strange  'Twas pitiful 'twas wondrous pitiful  She wish'd she had not heard ityet she wish'd  That heav'n had made her such a manshe thank'd me  And bad me if I had a friend that lov'd her  I should but teach him how to tell my story  And that would woo her On this hint I spake  She lov'd me for the dangers I had past  And I lov'd her that she did pity them  This only is the witchcraft I have us'd  Othello act sc  In this instance it will be observed that admiration concurred with pity to produce love  SECT V Causes of the passions of fear and anger  FEar and anger to answer the purposes of nature are happily so contrived as to operate either instinctively or deliberately So far as they prompt actions considered as means leading to a certain end they fall in with the general system and require no particular explanation If any object have a threatening appearance reason suggests means to avoid the danger If I am injured the first thing I think of is in what manner I shall be revenged and what means I shall employ These particulars are not less obvious than natural But as the passions of fear and anger so far as instinctive are less familiar to us and their nature generally not understood I thought it would not be unacceptable to the reader  to have them accurately delineated He may also possibly relish the opportunity of this specimen to have the nature of instinctive passions more fully explained than there was formerly occasion to do I begin with fear  Selfpreservation is to individuals a matter of too great importance to be left entirely under the guardianship of selflove which cannot be put in exercise otherwise than by the intervention of reason and reflection Nature hath acted here with her usual precaution and foresight Fear and anger are passions common to all men and by operating instinctively they frequently afford security when the slower operations of deliberative reason would be too late We take nourishment commonly not by the direction of reason but by the incitement of hunger and thirst In the same manner we avoid danger by the incitement of fear which often before there is time for reflection placeth us in safety This matter then is ordered with consummate wisdom It is not within the reach of fancy to conceive any thing better fitted  to answer its purpose than this instinctive passion of fear which upon the first surmise of danger operates instantaneously without reflection So little doth the passion in such instances depend on reason that we often find it exerted even in contradiction to reason and when we are conscious that there is no hazard A man who is not much upon his guard cannot avoid shrinking at a blow though he knows it to be aimed in sport nor closing his eyes at the approach of what may hurt them though he is confident it will not come their length Influenced by the same instinctive passion of fear infants are much affected with a stern look a menacing tone or other expression of anger though being incapable of reflection they cannot form the slightest judgement about the import of these signs This is all that is necessary to be said in general The natural connection betwixt fear and the external signs of anger will be handled in the chapter of the external signs of emotions and passions  Fear provides for selfpreservation by flying  from harm anger by repelling it Nothing indeed can be better contrived to repel or prevent injury than anger or resentment Destitute of this passion men like defenceless lambs would lie constantly open to mischief  Brasidas being surprised by the bite of a mouse he had catched let it slip out of his singers  "No creature says he is so contemptible but what may provide for its own safety if it have courage to defend itself"  Plutarch Apothegmata  Deliberate anger caused by a voluntary injury is too well known to require any explanation If my desire be in general to resent an afront I must use means and these means must be discovered by reflection Deliberation is here requisite and in this which is the ordinary case the passion seldom exceeds just bounds But where anger suddenly inflames me to return a blow the passion is instinctive and the action ultimate and it is chiefly in such cases that the passion is rash and ungovernable because it operates blindly without affording time for reason or deliberation  Instinctive anger is frequently raised by bodily pain which when sudden and excessive as by a stroke on a tender part ruffling the temper and unhinging the mind is in its tone similar to anger Bodily pain by this means disposes to anger which is as suddenly raised provided an object be found to vent it upon Anger commonly is not provoked otherwise than by a voluntary injury But when a man is thus beforehand disposed to anger he is not nice nor scrupulous about an object The man who gave the stroke however accidentally is by an inflammable temper held a proper object merely because he was the occasion of the pain It is still a stronger example of the kind that a stock or a stone by which I am hurt becomes an object for my resentment I am violently incited to bray it to atoms The passion indeed in this case is but momentary It vanisheth with the first reflection being attended with no circumstance that can excuse it in any degree Nor is this irrational effect confined to bodily pain Inward distress when excessive may be the occasion of effects equally irrational  When a friend is danger and the event uncertain the perturbation of mind occasioned thereby will in a fiery temper produce momentary fits of anger against this very friend however innocent Thus Shakespear in the  Tempest    Alonzo  Sit down and rest  Ev'n here I will put off my hope and keep it  No longer for my flatterer he is drown'd  Whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks  Our frustrate search on land Well let him go  Act sc  The final words  Well    let him go  are an expression of impatience and anger at Ferdinand whose absence greatly distressed his father dreading that he was lost in the storm This nice operation of the human mind is by Shakespear exhibited upon another occasion and finely painted In the tragedy of  Othello  Iago by dark hints and suspicious circumstances had roused Othello's jealousy which however appeared too slightly founded to be vented upon Desdemona its proper object The perturbation and distress of mind thereby  occasioned produced a momentary resentment against Iago considered as occasioning the jealousy though innocent  Othello  Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore  Be sure of it give me the ocular proof  Or by the wrath of man's eternal soul  Thou hadst been better have been born a dog  Than answer my wak'd wrath  Iago  Is't come to this  Othello  Make me see't or at the least so prove it  That the probation bear no hinge or loop  To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life  Iago  My Noble Lord  Othello  If thou dost slander her and torture me  Never pray more abandon all remorse  On horrors head horrors accumulate  Do deeds to make heav'n weep all earth amaz'd  For nothing canst thou to damnation add  Greater than that  Othello act sc  This blind and absurd effect of anger is more gaily illustrated by Addison in a story the  dramatis personae  of which are a cardinal and a spy retained in pay for intelligence The cardinal is represented as minuting  down every thing that is told him The spy begins with a low voice  "Such an one the advocate whispered to one of his friends within my hearing that your Eminence was a very great poltron"  and after having given his patron time to take it down adds  "That another called him a mercenary rascal in a public conversation"  The cardinal replies  "Very well"  and bids him go on The spy proceeds and loads him with reports of the same nature till the cardinal rises in great wrath calls him an impudent scoundrel and kicks him out of the room  Spectator N  o      We meet with instances every day of resentment raised by loss at play and wreaked on the cards or dice But anger a furious passion is satisfied with a connection still slighter than that of cause and effect of which Congreve in the  Mourning Bride  gives one beautiful example  Gonsalez  Have comfort  Almeria  Curs'd be that tongue that bids me be of comfort  Curs'd my own tongue that could not move his pity  Curs'd these weak hands that could not hold him here  For he is gone to doom Alphonso's death  Act sc  I have chosen to exhibit anger in its more rare appearances for in these we can best trace its nature and extent In the examples above given it appears to be an absurd passion and altogether irrational But we ought to consider that it is not the intention of nature to subject this passion in every instance to reason and reflection It was given us to prevent or to repel injuries and like fear it often operates blindly and instinctively without the least view to consequences The very first sensation of harm sets it in motion to repel injury by punishment Were it more cool and deliberate it would lose its threatening appearance and be insufficient to guard us against violence and mischief When such is and ought to be the nature of the passion it is not wonderful to find it exerted irregularly and capriciously as it sometimes is where the mischief  is sudden and unforeseen All the harm that can be done by the passion in this case is instantaneous for the shortest delay sets all to rights and circumstances are seldom so unlucky as to put it in the power of a passionate man to do much harm in an instant  SECT VI Emotions caused by fiction  THE attentive reader will observe that in accounting for passions and emotions no cause hitherto has been assigned but what hath a real existence Whether it be a being action or quality that moveth us it is supposed to be an object of our knowledge or at least of our belief This observation discovers to us that the subject is not yet exhausted because our passions as all the world know are moved by fiction as well as by truth In judging beforehand of man so remarkably addicted to truth and reality one should little dream  that fiction could have any effect upon him But man's intellectual faculties are too imperfect to dive far even into his own nature I shall take occasion afterward to show that this branch of the human constitution is contrived with admirable wisdom and is subservient to excellent purposes In the mean time I must endeavour to unfold by what means fiction hath such influence on the mind  That the objects of our senses really exist in the way and manner we perceive is a branch of intuitive knowledge When I see a man walking a tree growing or cattle grazing I have a conviction that these things are precisely as they appear If I be a spectator of any transaction or event I have a conviction of the real existence of the persons engaged of their words and of their actions Nature determines us to rely on the veracity of our senses And indeed if our senses did not convince us of the reality of their objects they could not in any degree answer their end  By the power of memory a thing formerly seen may be recalled to the mind  with different degrees of accuracy We commonly are satisfied with a slight recollection of the chief circumstances and in such recollection the thing is not figured as present nor any image formed I retain the consciousness of my present situation and barely remember that formerly I was a spectator But with respect to an interesting object or event which made a strong impression the mind sometimes not satisfied with a cursory review chuses to revolve every circumstance In this case I conceive myself to be a spectator as I was originally and I perceive every particular passing in my presence in the same manner as when I was in reality a spectator For example I saw yesterday a beautiful woman in tears for the loss of an only child and was greatly moved with her distress Not satisfied with a slight recollection or bare remembrance I insist on the melancholy scene Conceiving myself to be in the place where I was an eyewitness every circumstance appears to me as at first I think I see the woman in tears and hear her moans Hence it may be justly said that in a complete idea of memory  there is no past nor future A thing recalled to the mind with the accuracy I have been describing is perceived as in our view and consequently as presently existing Past time makes a part of an incomplete idea only I remember or reflect that some years ago I was at Oxford and saw the first stone laid of the Ratcliff library and I remember that at a still greater distance of time I heard a debate in the house of Commons about a standing army  Lamentable is the imperfection of language almost in every particular that falls not under external sense I am talking of a matter exceeding clear in itself and of which every person must be conscious and yet I find no small difficulty to express it clearly in words for it is not accurate to talk of incidents long past as passing in our sight nor of hearing at present what we really heard yesterday or perhaps a year ago To this necessity I am reduced by want of proper words to describe ideal presence and to distinguish it from real presence And thus in the description a plain subject becomes obscure and intricate When I recall any  thing in the distinctest manner so as to form an idea or image of it as present I have not words to describe this act other than that I perceive the thing as a spectator and as existing in my presence This means not that I am really a spectator but only that I conceive myself to be a spectator and have a consciousness of presence similar to what a real spectator hath  As many rules of criticism depend on ideal presence the reader it is expected will take some pains to form an exact notion of it as distinguished on the one hand from real presence and on the other from a superficial or reflective remembrance It is distinguished from the former by the following circumstance Ideal presence arising from an act of memory may properly be termed  a waking dream  because like a dream it vanisheth upon the first reflection of our present situation Real presence on the contrary vouched by eyesight commands our belief not only during the direct perception but in reflecting afterward upon the object And to distinguish ideal presence from the latter I give the following  illustration Two internal acts both of them exertions of memory are clearly distinguishable When I think of an event as past without forming any image it is barely reflecting or remembering that I was an eyewitness But when I recall the event so distinctly as to form a complete image of it I perceive it ideally as passing in my presence and this ideal perception is an act of intuition into which reflection enters not more than into an act of sight  Though ideal presence be distinguished from real presence on the one side and from reflective remembrance on the other it is however variable without any precise limits rising sometimes toward the former and often sinking toward the latter In a vigorous exertion of memory ideal presence is extremely distinct When a man as in a reverie drops himself out of his thoughts he perceives every thing as passing before him and hath a consciousness of presence similar to that of a spectator There is no other difference but that in the former the consciousness of presence is less firm and clear than in the latter But this is seldom  the case Ideal presence is often faint and the image so obscure as not to differ widely from reflective remembrance  Hitherto of an idea of memory I proceed to consider the idea of a thing I never saw raised in me by speech by writing or by painting This idea with respect to the present matter is of the same nature with an idea of memory being either complete or incomplete An important event by a lively and accurate description rouses my attention and insensibly transforms me into a spectator I perceive ideally every incident as passing in my presence On the other hand a slight or superficial narrative produceth only a faint and incomplete idea precisely similar to a reflective recollection of memory Of such idea ideal presence makes no part Past time is a circumstance that enters into this idea as it doth into a reflective idea of memory I believe that Scipio existed about years ago and that he overcame Hannibal in the famous battle of Zama When I revolve in so cursory a manner that memorable event I consider it as long past But supposing me  to be warmed with the story perhaps by a beautiful description I am insensibly transformed to a spectator I perceive these two heroes in act to engage I perceive them brandishing their swords and exhorting their troops and in this manner I attend them through every circumstance of the battle This event being present to my mind during the whole progress of my thoughts admits not any time but the present  I have had occasion to observe  Part sect of the present chapter  that ideas both of memory and of speech produce emotions of the same kind with what are produced by an immediate view of the object only fainter in proportion as an idea is fainter than an original perception The insight we have now got unfolds the means by which this effect is produced Ideal presence supplies the want of real presence and in idea we perceive persons acting and suffering precisely as in an original survey If our sympathy be engaged by the latter it must also in some measure  be engaged by the former The distinctness of ideal presence as above mentioned approacheth sometimes to the distinctness of real presence and the consciousness of presence is the same in both This is the cause of the pleasure that is felt in a reverie where a man losing sight of himself is totally occupied with the objects passing in his mind which he conceives to be really existing in his presence The power of speech to raise emotions depends entirely on the artifice of raising such lively and distinct images as are here described The reader's passions are never sensibly moved till he be thrown into a kind of reverie in which state losing the consciousness of self and of reading his present occupation he conceives every incident as passing in his presence precisely as if he were an eyewitness A general or reflective remembrance hath not this effect It may be agreeable in some slight degree but the ideas suggested by it are too faint and obscure to raise any thing like a sympathetic emotion And were they ever so lively they pass with too much precipitation to have this  effect Our emotions are never instantaneous even those that come the soonest to perfection have different periods of birth growth and maturity and to give opportunity for these different periods it is necessary that the cause of every emotion be present to the mind a due time The emotion is completed by reiterated impressions We know this to be the case of objects of sight we are scarce sensible of any emotion in a quick succession even of the most beautiful objects And if this hold in the succession of original perceptions how much more in the succession of ideas  Though all this while I have been only describing what passeth in the mind of every one and what every one must be conscious of it was necessary to enlarge upon it because however clear in the internal conception it is far from being so when described in words Ideal presence though of general importance hath scarce ever been touched by any writer and at any rate it could not be overlooked in accounting for the effects produced by fiction Upon this point the reader I guess has prevented me It already must have occurred  to him that if in reading ideal presence be the means by which our passions are moved it makes no difference whether the subject be a fable or a reality When ideal presence is complete we perceive every object as in our sight and the mind totally occupied with an interesting event finds no leisure for reflection of any sort This reasoning if any one hesitate is confirmed by constant and universal experience Let us take under consideration the meeting of Hector and Andromache in the sixth book of the Iliad or some of the passionate scenes in King Lear These pictures of human life when we are sufficiently engaged give an impression of reality not less distinct than that given by the death of Otho in the beautiful description of Tacitus We never once reflect whether the story be true or feigned Reflection comes afterward when we have the scene no longer before our eyes This reasoning will appear in a still clearer light by opposing ideal presence to ideas raised by a cursory narrative which ideas being faint obscure and imperfect occupy the mind so little as to solicit reflection And accordingly  a curt narrative of feigned incidents is never relished Any slight pleasure it affords is more than counterbalanced by the disgust it inspires for want of truth  In support of the foregoing theory I add what I reckon a decisive argument Upon examination it will be found that genuine history commands our passions by means of ideal presence solely and therefore that with respect to this effect genuine history stands upon the same footing with fable To me it appears clear that our sympathy must vanish so soon as we begin to reflect upon the incidents related in either The reflection that a story is a pure fiction will indeed prevent our sympathy but so will equally the reflection that the persons described are no longer existing It is present distress only that moves my pity My concern vanishes with the distress for I cannot pity any person who at present is happy According to this theory founded clearly on human nature a man long dead and insensible now of past misfortunes cannot move our pity more than if he had never existed The misfortunes described in a  genuine history command our belief but then we believe also that these misfortunes are at an end and that the persons described are at present under no distress What effect for example can the belief of the rape of Lucretia have to raise our sympathy when she died above years ago and hath at present no painful feeling of the injury done her The effect of history in point of instruction depends in some measure upon its veracity But history cannot reach the heart while we indulge any reflection upon the facts Such reflection if it engage our belief never fails at the same time to poison our pleasure by convincing us that our sympathy for those who are dead and gone is absurd And if reflection be laid aside history stands upon the same footing with fable What effect either of them may have to raise our sympathy depends on the vivacity of the ideas they raise and with respect to that circumstance fable is generally more successful than history  Of all the means for making an impression of ideal presence theatrical representation is the most powerful That words independent  of action have the same power in a less degree every one of sensibility must have felt A good tragedy will extort tears in private though not so forcibly as upon the stage This power belongs also to painting A good historical picture makes a deeper impression than can be made by words though not equal to what is made by theatrical action And as ideal presence depends on a lively impression painting seems to possess a middle place betwixt reading and acting In making an impression of ideal presence it is not less superior to the former than inferior to the latter  It must not however be thought that our passions can be raised by painting to such a height as can be done by words Of all the successive incidents that concur to produce a great event a picture has the choice but of one because it is confined to a single instant of time And though the impression it makes is the deepest that can be made instantaneously yet seldom can a passion be raised to any height in an instant or by a single impression It was observed above that our passions those especially of  the sympathetic kind require a succession of impressions and for that reason reading and still more acting have greatly the advantage by the opportunity of reiterating impressions without end  Upon the whole it is by means of ideal presence that our passions are excited and till words produce that charm they avail nothing Even real events intitled to our belief must be conceived present and passing in our sight before they can move us And this theory serves to explain several phenomena otherwise unaccountable A misfortune happening to a stranger makes a less impression than happening to a man we know even where we are no way interested in him our acquaintance with this man however slight aids the conception of his suffering in our presence For the same reason we are little moved with any distant event because we have more difficulty to conceive it present than an event that happened in our neighbourhood  Every one is sensible that describing a past event as present has a fine effect in language For what other reason than that  it aids the conception of ideal presence Take the following example  And now with shouts the shocking armies clos'd  To lances lances shields to shields oppos'd  Host against host the shadowy legions drew  The sounding darts an iron tempest flew  Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries  Triumphing shouts and dying groans arise  With streaming blood the slipp'ry field is dy'd  And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide  In this passage we may observe how the writer inflamed with the subject insensibly slips from the past time to the present led to this form of narration by conceiving every circumstance as passing in his own sight And this at the same time has a fine effect upon the reader by advancing him to be as it were a spectator But this change from the past to the present requires some preparation and is not graceful in the same sentence where there is no stop in the sense witness the following passage  Thy fate was next O Phaestus doom'd to feel  The great Idomeneus' protended steel  Whom Borus sent his son and only joy  From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy  The Cretan jav'lin reach'd him from afar  And pierc'd his shoulder as he mounts his car  Iliad v  It is still worse to fall back to the past in the same period for this is an anticlimax in description  Through breaking ranks his furious course he bends  And at the goddess his broad lance extends  Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove  Th' ambrosial veil which all the graces wove  Her snowy hand the razing steel profan'd  And the transparent skin with crimson stain'd  Iliad v  Again describing the shield of Jupiter  Here all the terrors of grim War appear  Here rages Force here tremble Flight and Fear  Here storm'd Contention and here Fury frown'd  And the dire orb portentous Gorgon crown'd  Iliad v  Nor is it pleasant to be carried backward and forward alternately in a rapid succession  Then dy'd Seamandrius expert in the chace  In woods and wilds to wound the savage race  Diana taught him all her sylvan arts  To bend the bow and aim unerring darts  But vainly here Diana's arts he tries  The fatal lance arrests him as he flies  From Menelaus' arm the weapon sent  Through his broad back and heaving bosom went  Down sinks the warrior with a thund'ring sound  His brazen armor rings against the ground  Iliad v  It is wonderful to observe upon what slender foundations nature sometimes erects her most solid and magnificent works In appearance at least what can be more slight than ideal presence of objects And yet upon it entirely is superstructed that extensive influence which language hath over the heart an influence which more than any other means strengthens the bond of society and attracts individuals from their private system to exert themselves in acts of generosity and benevolence Matters of fact it is true and truth in general may be inculcated without taking advantage of ideal presence But without it the finest speaker or  writer would in vain attempt to move any of our passion our sympathy would be confined to objects that are really present and language would lose entirely that signal power it possesseth of making us sympathize with beings removed at the greatest distance of time as well as of place Nor is the influence of language by means of this ideal presence confined to the heart It reaches also in some measure the understanding and contributes to belief When events are related in a lively manner and every circumstance appears as passing before us it is with difficulty that we suffer the truth of the facts to be questioned A historian accordingly who hath a genius for narration seldom fails to engage our belief The same facts related in a manner cold and indistinct are not suffered to pass without examination A thing ill described is like an object seen at a distance or through a mist we doubt whether it be a reality or a fiction For this reason a poet who can warm and animate his reader may employ bolder fictions than ought to be ventured by an inferior genius The reader once thoroughly  engaged is in that situation susceptible of the strongest impressions  Veraque constituunt quae bellè tangere possunt  Aureis et lepido quae sunt fucata sonore  Lucretius lib l  A masterly painting has the same effect Le Brun is no small support to Quintus Curtius and among the vulgar in Italy the belief of scripturehistory is perhaps founded as much upon the authority of Raphael Michael Angelo and other celebrated painters as upon that of the sacred writers  At quae Polycleto defuerunt Phidiae atque Alcameni dantur Phidias tamen diis quam hominibus efficiendis melior artifex traditur in ebore vero longe citra aemulum vel si nihil nisi Minervam Athenis aut Olympium in Elide Jovem fecisset cujus pulchritudo adjecisse aliquid etiam receptae religioni videtur adeo majestas operis Deum aequavit  Quintilian lib cap §    In establishing the foregoing theory the reader has had the fatigue of much dry reasoning But his labour will not be fruitless From this theory are derived many useful rules in criticism which shall be mentioned  in their proper places One specimen being a fine illustration I chuse to give at present In a historical poem representing human actions it is a rule that no improbable incident ought to be admitted A circumstance an incident or an event may be singular may surprise by being unexpected and yet be extremely natural The improbability I talk of is that of an irregular fact contrary to the order and course of nature and therefore unaccountable A chain of imagined facts linked together according to the order of nature find easy entrance into the mind and if described with warmth of fancy they produce complete images including ideal presence But it is with great difficulty that we admit any irregular fact for an irregular fact always puzzles the judgement Doubtful of its reality we immediately enter upon reflection and discovering the cheat lose all relish and concern This is an unhappy effect for thereafter it requires more than an ordinary effort to restore the waking dream and to make the reader conceive even the more probable incidents as passing in his presence  I never was an admirer of machinery in an epic poem and I now find my taste justified by reason the foregoing argument concluding still more strongly against imaginary beings than against improbable facts Fictions of this nature may amuse by their novelty and singularity but they never move the sympathetic passions because they cannot impose on the mind any perception of reality I appeal to the discerning reader whether this be not precisely the case of the machinery introduced by Taffo and by Voltaire This machinery is not only in itself cold and uninteresting but is remarkably hurtful by giving an air of fiction to the whole composition A burlesque poem such as the Lutrin or the Dispensary may employ machinery with success for these poems though they assume the air of history give entertainment chiefly by their pleasant and ludicrous pictures to which machinery contributes in a singular manner It is not the aim of such a poem to raise our sympathy in any considerable degree and for that reason a strict imitation of nature is not required A poem professedly  ludicrous may employ machinery to great advantage and the more extravagant the better A just representation of nature would indeed be incongruous in a composition intended to give entertainment by the means chiefly of singularity and surprise  For accomplishing the task undertaken in the beginning of the present section what only remains is to show the final cause of the power that fiction hath over the mind of man I have already mentioned that language by means of fiction has the command of our sympathy for the good of others By the same means our sympathy may be also raised for our own good In the third section it is observed that examples both of virtue and of vice raise virtuous emotions which becoming stronger by exercise tend to make us virtuous by habit as well as by principle I now further observe that examples drawn from real events are not so frequent as to contribute much to a habit of virtue If they be they are not recorded by historians It therefore shows great wisdom to form us in such a manner as to be susceptible of the same improvement  from fable that we receive from genuine history By this admirable contrivance examples to improve us in virtue may be multiplied without end No other sort of discipline contributes more to make virtue habitual and no other sort is so agreeable in the application I add another final cause with thorough satisfaction because it shows that the author of our nature is not less kindly provident for the happiness of his creatures than for the regularity of their conduct The power that fiction hath over the mind of man is the source of an endless variety of refined amusement always ready to employ a vacant hour Such amusement is a fine resource in solitude and by sweetening the temper improves society  PART II Emotions and passions as pleasant and painful agreeable and disagreeable Modifications of these qualities  IT will naturally occur at first view that a discourse upon the passions should commence  with explaining the qualities now mentioned But upon trial I found this could not be done distinctly till the difference were ascertained betwixt an emotion and a passion and till their causes were evolved  Great obscurity may be observed among writers with regard to the present point No care for example is taken to distinguish agreeable from pleasant disagreeable from painful or rather these terms are deemed synonymous This is an error not at all venial in the science of ethics as instances can and shall be given of painful passions that are agreeable and of pleasant passions that are disagreeable These terms it is true are used indifferently in familiar conversations and in composition for amusement where accuracy is not required But for those to use them so who profess to explain the passions is a capital error In writing upon the critical art I would avoid every refinement that may seem more curious than useful But the proper meaning of the terms under consideration must be ascertained in order to understand the passions  and some of their effects that are intimately connected with criticism  I shall endeavour to explain these terms by familiar examples Viewing a fine garden I perceive it to be beautiful or agreeable and I consider the beauty or agreeableness as belonging to the object or as one of its qualities Again when I turn my thoughts from the garden to what passes in my mind I am conscious of a pleasant emotion of which the garden is the cause The pleasure here is felt not as a quality of the garden but of the emotion produced by it I give an opposite example A rotten carcass is loathsome and disagreeable and raises in the spectator a painful emotion The disagreeableness is a quality of the object the pain is a quality of the emotion produced by it Agreeable and disagreeable then are qualities of the objects we perceive pleasant and painful are qualities of the emotions we feel The former qualities are perceived as adhering to objects the latter are felt as existing within us  But a passion or emotion beside being felt is frequently made an object of thought  or reflection we examine it we inquire into its nature its cause and its effects In this view it partakes the nature of other objects it is either agreeable or disagreeable Hence clearly appear the different significations of the terms under consideration as applied to passion When a passion is termed  pleasant  or  painful  we refer to the actual feeling when termed  agreeable  or  disagreeable  it is considered as an object of thought or reflection A passion is pleasant or painful to the person in whom it exists it is agreeable or disagreeable to the person who makes it a subject of contemplation  When the terms thus defined are applied to particular emotions and passions they do not always coincide And in order to make this evident we must endeavour to ascertain first what passions and emotions are pleasant what painful and next what are agreeable what disagreeable With respect to both there are general rules which so far as I gather from induction admit not any exceptions The nature of an emotion or passion as pleasant or painful depends entirely on its cause An agreeable object produceth  always a pleasant emotion and a disagreeable object produceth always a painful emotion  See part of this chapter  Thus a lofty oak a generous action a valuable discovery in art or science are agreeable objects that unerringly produce pleasant emotions A stinking puddle a treacherous action an irregular illcontrived edifice being disagreeable objects produce painful emotions Selfish passions are pleasant for they arise from self an agreeable object or cause A social passion directed upon an agreeable object is always pleasant directed upon an object in distress is painful  See the place above cited  Lastly all dissocial passions such as envy resentment malice being caused by disagreeable objects cannot fail to be painful  It requires a greater compass to evolve the general rule that concerns the agreeableness or disagreeableness of emotions and passions An action conformable to the common nature of our species is perceived by us to be  regular and good  Essays on the principles of morality and natural religion part ess chap  and consequently every such action appears agreeable to us The same observation is applicable to passions and emotions Every feeling that is conformable to the common nature of our species is perceived by us to be regular and as it ought to be and upon that account it must appear agreeable By this general rule we can ascertain what emotions are agreeable what disagreeable Every emotion that is conformable to the common nature of man ought to appear agreeable And that this holds true with respect to pleasant emotions will readily be admitted But why should painful emotions be an exception when they are not less natural than the other The proposition holds true in both Thus the painful emotion raised by a monstrous birth or brutal action is not less agreeable upon reflection than the pleasant emotion raised by a flowing river or a lofty dome With respect to passions as opposed to emotions it will be obvious from the foregoing proposition that their agreeableness or disagreeableness  like the actions of which they are productive must be regulated entirely by the moral sense Every action vicious or improper is disagreeable to a spectator and so is the passion that prompts it Every action virtuous or proper is agreeable to a spectator and so is the passion that prompts it  This deduction may be carried a great way farther but to avoid intricacy and obscurity I make but one other step A passion which as aforesaid becomes an object of thought to a spectator may have the effect to produce a passion or emotion in him for it is natural that a social being should be affected with the passions of others Passions or emotions thus generated submit in common with others to the general law above mentioned  viz  that an agreeable object produces a pleasant emotion and a disagreeable object a painful emotion Thus the passion of gratitude being to a spectator an agreeable object produceth in him the pleasant passion of love to the grateful person Thus malice being to a spectator a disagreeable object produceth in  him the painful passion of hatred to the malicious person  We are now prepared for examples of pleasant passions that are disagreeable and of painful passions that are agreeable Selflove so long as confined within just bounds is a passion both pleasant and agreeable In excess it is disagreeable though it continues to be still pleasant Our appetites are precisely in the same condition Again vanity though pleasant is disagreeable Resentment on the other hand is in every stage of the passion painful but is not disagreeable unless in excess Pity is always painful yet always agreeable But however distinct these qualities are they coincide I acknowledge in one class of passions All vicious passions tending to the hurt of others are equally painful and disagreeable  The foregoing distinctions among passions and emotions may serve the common affairs of life but they are not sufficient for the critical art The qualities of pleasant and painful are too familiar to carry us far into human nature or to form an accurate judgement in the fine arts It is further  necessary that we be made acquainted with the several modifications of these qualities with the modifications at least that make the greatest figure Even at first view every one is sensible that the pleasure or pain of one passion differs from that of another How distant the pleasure of revenge from that of love So distant as that we cannot without reluctance admit them to be any way related That the same quality of pleasure should be so differently modified in different passions will not be surprising when we reflect on the boundless variety of pleasant sounds tastes and smells daily felt Our discernment reaches differences still more nice in objects even of the same sense We have no difficulty to distinguish different sweets different sours and different bitters Honey is sweet and so is sugar and yet they never pass the one for the other Our sense of smelling is sufficiently acute to distinguish varieties in sweetsmelling flowers without end With respect to passions and emotions their different feelings have no limits for when we attempt the more delicate modifications  they elude our search and are scarce discernible In this matter however there is an analogy betwixt our internal and external senses The latter generally are sufficiently acute for all the useful purposes of life and so are the former Some persons indeed Nature's favourites have a wonderful acuteness of sense which to them unfolds many a delightful scene totally hid from vulgar eyes But if such refined pleasure be refused to the bulk of mankind it is however wisely ordered that they are not sensible of the defect and it detracts not from their happiness that others secretly are more happy With relation to the fine arts only this qualification seems essential and there it is termed  delicacy of taste  Should an author of such a taste attempt to describe all those differences and shades of pleasant and painful emotions which he himself feels he would soon meet an invincible obstacle in the poverty of language No known tongue hitherto has reached such perfection as to express clearly the more delicate feelings A people must be thoroughly refined before their language  become so comprehensive We must therefore rest satisfied with an explanation of the more obvious modifications  In forming a comparison betwixt pleasant passions of different kinds we conceive some of them to be  gross  some  refined  Those pleasures of external sense that are felt as at the organ of sense are conceived to be corporeal or gross  See the introduction  The pleasures of the eye and ear are felt to be internal and for that reason are conceived to be more pure and refined  The social affections are conceived by all to be more refined than the selfish Sympathy and humanity are reckoned the finest temper of mind and for that reason the prevalence of the social affections in the progress of society is held to be a refinement in our nature A savage is unqualified for any pleasure but what is thoroughly or nearly selfish therefore a savage is incapable of comparing selfish and social pleasure But a man after acquiring a high relish of the latter loses not thereby a taste for the former This man can judge and he  will give preference to social pleasures as more sweet and refined In fact they maintain that character not only in the direct feeling but also when we make them the subject of reflection The social passions are by far more agreeable than the selfish and rise much higher in our esteem  Refined manners and polite behaviour must not be deemed altogether artificial Men accustomed to the sweets of society who cultivate humanity find an elegant pleasure in preferring others and making them happy of which the proud or selfish scarce have a conception  Ridicule which chiefly arises from pride a selfish passion is at best but a gross pleasure A people it is true must have emerged out of barbarity before they can have a taste for ridicule But it is too rough an entertainment for those who are highly polished and refined Ridicule is banished France and is losing ground daily in England  Other modifications of pleasant passions will be occasionally mentioned hereafter Particularly the modifications of  high  and  low  are handled in the chapter of grandeur and sublimity and the modifications of  dignified  and  mean  in the chapter of dignity and meanness  PART III Interrupted existence of emotions and passionsTheir growth and decay  WEre emotions of the same nature with colour and figure to continue in their present state till varied by some operating cause the condition of man would be deplorable It is ordered wisely that emotions should more resemble another attribute of matter  viz  motion which requires the constant exertion of an operating cause and ceases when the cause is withdrawn An emotion may subsist while its cause is present and when its cause is removed may subsist by means of an idea though in a fainter degree But the moment another thought breaks in and occupies the mind so as to exclude not only this cause but also its idea the emotion  is gone it is no longer felt If it return with its cause or idea it again vanisheth with them when other thoughts crowd in This observation is applicable to emotions and passions of every kind And these accordingly are connected with perceptions and ideas so intimately as not to have any independent existence A strong passion it is true hath a mighty influence to detain its object in the mind but not so as to detain it for ever A succession of perceptions or ideas is unavoidable  See this point explained afterwards chap  the object of the passion may be often recalled but however interesting it must by intervals yield to other objects For this reason a passion rarely continues long with an equal degree of vigour It is felt strong and moderate in a pretty quick succession The same object makes not always the same impression because the mind being of a limited capacity cannot at the same instant give great attention to a plurality of objects The strength of a passion depends on the impression made by its cause and a cause  makes its strongest impression when happening to be the single interesting object it attracts our whole attention  See the appendix containing definitions and explanation of terms sect  Its impression is slighter when our attention is divided betwixt it and other objects and at that time the passion is slighter in proportion  When emotions and passions are felt thus by intervals and have not a continued existence it may be thought a nice problem to ascertain their identity and to determine when they are the same when different In a strict philosophic view every single impression made even by the same object is distinguishable from what have gone before and from what succeed Neither is an emotion raised by an idea the same with what is raised by a sight of the object But such accuracy is not found in common apprehension nor is necessary in common language The emotions raised by a fine landscape in its successive appearances are not distinguished from each other nor even from those raised by successive  ideas of the object all of them are held to be the same A passion also is always reckoned the same so long as it is fixed upon the same object Thus love and hatred may continue the same for life Nay so loose are we in this way of thinking that many passions are reckoned the same even after a change of object This is the case of all passions that proceed from some peculiar propensity Envy for example is considered to be the same passion not only while it is directed upon the same person but even where it comprehends many persons at once Pride and malice are in the same condition So much was necessary to be said upon the identity of a passion and emotion in order to prepare for examining their growth and decay  The growth and decay of passions and emotions is a subject too extensive to be exhausted in an undertaking like the present I pretend only to give a cursory view of it so far as necessary for the purposes of criticism Some emotions are produced in their utmost perfection and have a very short endurance This is the case of surprise  of wonder and sometimes of terror Emotions raised by insensible objects such as trees rivers buildings pictures arrive at perfection almost instantaneously and have a long endurance a second view produceth nearly the same pleasure with the first Love hatred and some other passions increase gradually to a certain pitch and thereafter decay gradually Envy malice pride scarce ever decay Again some passions such as gratitude and revenge are often exhausted by a single act of gratification Other passions such as pride malice envy love hatred are not so exhausted but having a long continuance demand frequent gratification  In order to explain these differences it would be an endless work to examine every emotion and passion in particular We must be satisfied at present with some general views And with respect to emotions which are quiescent and not productive of desire their growth and decay are easily explained An emotion caused by an external object cannot naturally take longer time to arrive at perfection than is necessary for  a leisurely survey Such emotion also must continue long stationary without any sensible decay a second or third view of the object being nearly as agreeable as the first This is the case of an emotion produced by a fine prospect an impetuous river or a towering hill While a man remains the same such objects ought to have the same effect upon him Familiarity however hath an influence here as it hath every where Frequency of view after short intervals especially weans the mind gradually from the object which at last loses all relish The noblest object in the material world a clear and serene sky is quite disregarded unless perhaps after a course of bad weather An emotion raised by human virtues qualities or actions may grow imperceptibly by reiterated views of the object till it become so vigorous as to generate desire In this condition it must be handled as a passion  As to passion I observe first that when nature requires a passion to be sudden it is commonly produced in perfection This is frequently the case of fear and of anger Wonder and surprise are always produced  in perfection Reiterated impressions made by their cause exhaust these passions in place of inflaming them This will be explained afterward  Chap    In the next place when a passion hath for its foundation an original propensity peculiar to some men it generally comes soon to perfection The propensity upon representing a proper object is immediately enlivened into a passion This is the case of pride of envy and of malice  In the third place love and hatred have often a slow growth The good qualities or kind offices of a person raise in me pleasant emotions which by reiterated views are swelled into a passion involving desire of that person's happiness This desire being often put in exercise works gradually a change internally and at last produceth in me a settled habit of affection for that person now my friend Affection thus produced operates precisely like an original propensity To enliven it into a passion no more is required but the real or ideal presence  of the object The habit of aversion or hatred is brought on in the same manner And here I must observe by the way that love and hatred signify commonly affection not passion The bulk indeed of our passions are these affections inflamed into a passion by different circumstances The affection of love I bear to my son is inflamed into the passion of fear when he is in danger becomes hope when he hath a prospect of good fortune becomes admiration when he performs a laudable action and shame when he commits any wrong Aversion again becomes fear when there is a prospect of good fortune to my enemy becomes hope when he is in danger becomes joy when he is in distress and sorrow when a laudable action is performed by him  Fourthly the growth of some passions depends often on occasional circumstances Obstacles to gratification never fail to augment and inflame a passion A constant endeavour to remove the obstacle preserves the object of the passion ever in view which swells the passion by impressions frequently reiterated Thus the restraint of conscience  when an obstacle to love agitates the mind and inflames the passion  Quod licet ingratum est quod non licet acrius urit  Si nunquam Danaën habuisset ahenea turris  Non esset Danaë de Jove facta parens  Ovid Amor l  At the same time the mind distressed with the obstacle is disposed to indulge its distress by magnifying the pleasure of gratification which naturally inflames desire Shakespear expresses this observation finely  All impediments in fancy's course  Are motives of more fancy  We need no better example than a lover who hath many rivals Even the caprices of a mistress have the effect to inflame love These occasioning uncertainty of success tend naturally to make the anxious lover overvalue the happiness of fruition  So much upon the growth of passions Their continuance and decay come next under consideration And first it is a general  law of nature that things sudden in their growth are equally sudden in their decay This is commonly the case of anger and with respect to wonder and surprise another reason concurs that their causes are of short duration Novelty soon degenerates into familiarity and the unexpectedness of an object is soon sunk in the pleasure which the object affords us Fear which is a passion of greater importance as tending to selfpreservation is often instantaneous and yet is of equal duration with its cause Nay it frequently subsists after the cause is removed  In the next place a passion founded on a peculiar propensity subsists generally for ever This is the case of pride envy and malice Objects are never wanting to inflame the propensity into a passion  Thirdly it may be laid down as a general law of nature that every passion ceases upon attaining its ultimate end To explain this law we must distinguish betwixt a particular and a general end I call a particular end what may be accomplished by a single act A general end on the contrary  admits acts without number because it cannot be said that a general end is ever fully accomplished while the object of the passion subsists Gratitude and revenge are examples of the first kind The ends they aim at may be accomplished by a single act and when this act is performed the passions are necessarily at an end Love and hatred are examples of the other kind The desire of doing good or of doing mischief to an individual is a general end which admits acts without number and which seldom is fully accomplished Therefore these passions have frequently the same duration with their objects  Lastly it will afford us another general view to consider the difference betwixt an original propensity and an affection produced by custom The former adheres too close to the constitution ever to be eradicated and for that reason the passions to which it gives birth endure during life with no remarkable diminution of strength The latter which owes its birth and increment to time owes its decay to the same cause Affection decays gradually as it grew Hence long  absence extinguisheth hatred as well as love Affection wears out more gradually betwixt persons who living together are objects to each other of mutual goodwill and kindness But here habit comes in luckily to supply decayed affection It makes these persons necessary to the happiness of each other by the pain of separation  See chap  Affection to children hath a long endurance longer perhaps than any other affection Its growth keeps pace with that of its objects They display new beauties and qualifications daily to feed and augment the affection But whenever the affection becomes stationary it must begin to decay with a slow pace indeed in proportion to its increment In short man with respect to this life is a temporary being He grows becomes stationary decays and so must all his powers and passions  PART IV Coexistent emotions and passions  TO have a thorough knowledge of the human passions and emotions it is not sufficient that they be examined singly and separately As a plurality of them are sometimes felt at the same instant the manner of their coexistence and the effects thereby produced ought also to be examined This subject is extensive and it will be difficult to evolve all the laws that govern its endless variety of cases Such an undertaking may be brought to perfection but it must be by degrees The following hints may suffice for a first attempt  We begin with emotions raised by different sounds as the simplest case Two sounds that mix and are as it were incorporated before they reach the ear are said to be concordant That each sound produceth an emotion of its own must be admitted But then these emotions like the sounds  that produce them mix so intimately as to be rather one complex emotion than two emotions in conjunction Two sounds again that refuse incorporation or mixture are said to be discordant Being however heard at the same instant the emotions produced by them are conjoined and in that condition are unpleasant even where separately they are each of them pleasant  Similar to the emotion raised by mixed sounds is the emotion that an object of sight raises by means of its several qualities A tree for example with its qualities of colour figure size  c  is perceived to be one object and the emotion it raises is one not different emotions combined But though the emotion be one it is however not simple The perception of the tree is complex and the emotion raised by it must also be complex  With respect to coexistent emotions produced by different causes or objects it must be observed that there cannot be a concordance among objects of sight like what is perceived in sounds Objects of sight are never mixed or incorporated in the act of  vision Each object is perceived as it exists separately from others and each raiseth its own emotion which is felt distinctly however intimately connected the objects may be This doctrine holds in all the causes of emotion or passion sounds only excepted  To explain the manner in which such emotions coexist similar emotions must be distinguished from those that are dissimilar Two emotions are said to be similar when they tend each of them to produce the same tone of mind Chearful emotions however different their causes may be are similar and so are those which are melancholy Dissimilar emotions are easily explained by their opposition to what are similar Grandeur and littleness gaiety and gloominess are dissimilar emotions  Emotions perfectly similar readily combine and unite  It is easier to conceive the manner of coexistence of similar emotions than to describe it They cannot be said to mix or incorporate like concordant sounds Their union is rather of agreement or concord and therefore I have chosen the words in the text not as sufficient to express clearly the manner of their coexistence but only as less liable to exception than any other I can find  so as in a manner to become  one complex emotion witness the emotions produced by a number of flowers in a parterre or of trees in a wood Emotions again that are opposite or extremely dissimilar never combine nor unite The mind cannot simultaneously take on opposite tones it cannot at the same instant be both joyful and sad angry and satisfied proud and humble Dissimilar emotions may succeed each other with rapidity but they cannot exist simultaneously  Betwixt these two extremes emotions will unite more or less in proportion to the degree of their resemblance and the greater or less connection of their causes The beauty of a landscape and the singing of birds produce emotions that are similar in a considerable degree and these emotions therefore though proceeding from very different causes readily combine and unite On the other hand when the causes are intimately connected the emotions though but slightly resembling each other are forced into a sort of union I give for an example a mistress in distress When I consider her beauty I feel a pleasant emotion  and a painful emotion when I consider her distress These two emotions proceeding from different views of the object have very little resemblance to each other and yet their causes are so intimately connected as to force them into a sort of complex emotion partly pleasant partly painful This clearly explains some expressions common in poetry  a sweet distress    a pleasant pain  We proceed to the effects produced by means of the different manners of coexistence above described first the effects produced within the mind and next those that appear externally I discover two mental effects clearly distinguishable from each other The one may be represented by addition and subtraction in numbers and the other by harmony in sounds Two pleasant emotions that are similar readily unite when they are coexistent and the pleasure felt in the union is the sum of the two pleasures The combined emotions are like multiplied effects from the cooperation of different powers The same emotions in succession are far from making the same figure because the mind at no  instant of the succession is conscious of more than a single emotion This doctrine may aptly be illustrated by a landscape comprehending hills vallies plains rivers trees  c  The emotions produced by these several objects being similar in a high degree as falling in easily and sweetly with the same tone of mind are in conjunction extremely pleasant And this multiplied effect is felt from objects even of different senses as where a landscape is conjoined with the music of birds and odor of flowers Such multiplied effect as above hinted depends partly on the resemblance of the emotions and partly on the connection of their causes whence it follows that the effect must be the greatest where the causes are intimately connected and the emotions perfectly similar  The other pleasure arising from coexistent emotions which may be termed  the pleasure of concord or harmony  is ascertained by a different rule It is directly in proportion to the degree of resemblance betwixt the emotions and inversely in proportion to the degree of connection betwixt the causes  To feel this pleasure in perfection the resemblance cannot be too strong nor the connection too slight Where the causes are intimately connected the similar emotions they produce are felt like one complex emotion But the pleasure of harmony is not felt from one emotion single or complex It is felt from various similar emotions distinct from each other and yet sweetly combining in the mind and the less connection the causes have the more entire is the emotion of harmony This matter cannot be better illustrated than by the foregoing example of a landscape where the sight hearing and smelling are employed The accumulated pleasure of so many different similar emotions is not what delights us the most in this combination of objects The sense of harmony from these emotions sweetly uniting in the mind is still more delightful We feel this harmony in the different emotions proceeding from the visible objects but we feel it still more sensibly in the emotions proceeding from the objects of different senses This emotion of concord or harmony will  be more fully illustrated when the emotions produced by the sound of words and their meaning are taken under consideration  Chap sect    This emotion of concord from conjoined emotions is felt even where the emotions are not perfectly similar Love is a pleasant passion but then its sweetness and tenderness make it resemble in a considerable degree the painful passion of pity or grief and for that reason love accords better with these passions than with what are gay and sprightly I give the following example from Catullus where the concord betwixt love and grief has a fine effect even in so slight a subject as the death of a sparrow  Lugete ô Veneres Cupidinesque  Et quantum est hominum venustiorum  Passer mortuus est meae puellae  Quem plus illa oculis suis amabat  Nam mellitus erat suamque norat  Ipsam tam bene quam puella matrem  Nec sese a gremio illius movebat  Sed circumsiliens modo huc modo illuc  Ad solam dominam usque pipilabat  Qui nunc it per iter tenebricosum  Illuc unde negant redire quemquam  At vobis male sit malae tenebrae  Orci quae omnia bella devoratis  Tam bellum mihi passerem abstulistis  O factum male ô miselle passer  Tua nunc opera meae puellae  Flendo turgiduli rubent ocelli  To complete this branch of the subject I proceed to consider the effects of dissimilar emotions These effects obviously must be opposite to what are above described and in order to explain them with accuracy dissimilar emotions proceeding from connected causes must be distinguished from what proceed from causes that are unconnected Dissimilar emotions of the former kind being forced into a sort of unnatural union produce a feeling of discord instead of harmony It holds also that in computing their force subtraction must be used in place of addition which will be evident from what follows Dissimilar emotions forced into union are felt obscurely and imperfectly  for each tends to vary the tone of mind that is suited to the other and the mind thus distracted betwixt two objects is at no instant in a condition to receive a full impression from either Dissimilar emotions proceeding from unconnected causes are in a very different condition Dissimilar emotions in general are averse to union and as there is nothing to force them into union when their causes are unconnected emotions of this kind are never felt but in succession By that means they are not felt to be discordant and each hath an opportunity to make a full impression  This curious theory must be illustrated by examples In reading the description of the dismal waste book of  Paradise Lost  we are sensible of a confused feeling arising from dissimilar emotions forced into union  viz  the beauty of the description and the horror of the object described  Seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild  The seat of desolation void of light  Save what the glimmering of these livid flames  Casts pale and dreadful  Many other passages in this justly celebrated poem produce the same effect and we always observe that if the disagreeableness of the subject be obscured by the beautiful description this beauty is not less obscured by its discordant union with the disagreeableness of the subject For the same reason ascending smoke in a calm morning is improper in a picture full of violent action The emotion of stillness and tranquillity inspired by the former accords not with the lively and animated emotion inspired by the latter A parterre partly ornamented partly in disorder produces a mixt feeling of the same sort Two great armies in act to engage mix the dissimilar emotions of grandeur and of terror  Sembra d'alberi densi alta foresta  L'un campo e l'altro di tant' aste abbonda  Son tesi gli archi e son le lance in resta  Vibransi i dardi e rotasi ogni fionda  Ogni cavallo in guerra anco

Ogni sua tromba e maggior luce han l' arme  Gerusalemme liberata cant st  A virtuous man has drawn on himself a great misfortune by a fault incident to human nature and therefore venial The remorse he feels aggravates his distress and consequently raises our pity to a high pitch We indeed blame the man and the indignation raised by the fault he has committed is dissimilar to pity These two passions however proceeding from different views of the same object are forced into a sort of union But the indignation is so slight as scarce to be felt in the mixture with pity Subjects of this kind are of all the fittest for tragedy But of this afterward  Chap of epic and dramatic compositions    Opposite emotions are so dissimilar as not to admit any sort of union even where they proceed from causes the most intimately connected Love to a mistress and resentment for her infidelity are of this nature They cannot exist otherwise than in succession which by the connection of their causes is commonly rapid And these emotions will govern alternately till one of them obtain the ascendent or both be obliterated A succession opens to me by the death of a worthy man who was my friend as well as my kinsman When I think of my friend I am grieved but the succession gives me joy These two causes are intimately connected for the succession is the direct consequence of my friend's death The emotions however being opposite do not mix they prevail alternately perhaps for a course of time till grief for my friend's death be banished by the pleasures of opulence A virtuous man suffering unjustly is an example of the same kind I pity him and I have great indignation at the author of the wrong These emotions proceed from causes nearly connected but being directed upon different objects they  are not forced into union The opposition preserves them distinct and accordingly they are found to govern alternately the one sometimes prevailing and sometimes the other  Next of dissimilar emotions arising from unconnected causes Good and bad news of equal importance arriving at the same instant from different quarters produce opposite emotions the discordance of which is not felt because they are not forced into union They govern alternately commonly in a quick succession till their force be spent In the same manner good news arriving to a man labouring under distress occasions a vibration in his mind from the one to the other  Osmyn  By heav'n thou'st rous'd me from my lethargy  The spirit which was deaf to my own wrongs  And the loud cries of my dead father's blood  Deaf to revengenay

king  Where is Alphonso ha where where indeed  O I could tear and burst the strings of life  To break these chains Off off ye stains of royalty  Off slavery O curse that I alone  Can beat and flutter in my cage when I  Would soar and stoop at victory beneath  Mourning Bride act sc  If the emotions be unequal in force the stronger after a conflict will extinguish the weaker Thus the loss of a house by fire or of a sum of money by bankruptcy will make no figure in opposition to the birth of a longexpected son who is to inherit an opulent fortune After some slight vibrations the mind settles in joy and the loss is forgot  The foregoing observations will be found of great use in the fine arts Many practical rules are derived from them which I  shall have occasion afterward to mention For instant satisfaction in part I propose to show the use of these observations in music a theme I insist upon at present not being certain of another opportunity more favourable It will be admitted that no combination of sounds but what is agreeable to the ear is intitled to the name of music Melody and harmony are separately agreeable and in union delightful The agreeableness of vocal music differs from that of instrumental The former being intended to accompany words ought to be expressive of the sentiment that is conveyed by the words But the latter having no connection with words may be agreeable without expressing any sentiment Harmony properly so called though delightful when in perfection is not expressive of sentiment and we often find good melody without the least tincture of it  These preliminaries being established I proceed directly to the point In vocal music the intimate connection of sense and sound rejects dissimilar emotions those especially that are opposite Similar emotions  produced by the sense and sound go naturally into union and at the same time are felt to be concordant or harmonious Dissimilar emotions on the other hand forced into union by causes intimately connected not only obscure each other but are also unpleasant by discordance From these principles it is easy to say what sort of poetical compositions are fitted for music It is evident that no poem expressing the sentiments of any disagreeable passion is proper The pain a man feels who is actuated with malice or unjust revenge disqualifies him for relishing music or any thing that is entertaining And supposing him disposed against nature to vent his sentiments in music the mixture would be unpleasant for these passions raise disgust and aversion in the audience  See part of the present chapter toward the close  a tone of mind opposite to every emotion that music can inspire A man seized with remorse cannot bear music because every sort of it must be discordant with his tone of mind and when these by an unskilful artist are forced into  union the mixture is unpleasant to the audience  In general music never can have a good effect in conjunction with any composition expressive of malice envy peevishness or any other dissocial passion The pleasure of music on the other hand is similar to all pleasant emotions and music is finely qualified for every song where such emotions are expressed Music particularly in a chearful tone is concordant in the highest degree with every emotion in the same tone and hence our taste for chearful airs expressive of mirth and jollity Music is peculiarly well qualified for accompanying every sympathetic emotion Sympathetic joy associates finely with chearful music and sympathetic pain not less finely with music that is tender and melancholy All the different emotions of love  viz  tenderness concern anxiety pain of absence hope fear  c  accord delightfully with music A person in love even when unkindly treated is soothed by music The tenderness of love still prevailing accords with a melancholy strain This  is finely exemplified by Shakespear in the fourth act of  Othello  where Desdemona calls for a song expressive of her distress Wonderful is the delicacy of that writer's taste which fails him not even in the most refined emotions of human nature Melancholy music again is suitable to slight grief which requires or admits consolation But deep grief which refuses all consolation rejects for that reason even melancholy music For a different reason music is improper for accompanying pleasant emotions of the more important kind These totally ingross the mind and leave no place for music or any sort of amusement In a perilous enterprise to dethrone a tyrant music would be impertinent even where hope prevails and the prospect of success is great Alexander attacking the Indian town and mounting the wall had certainly no impulse to exert his prowess in a song It is true that not the least regard is paid to these rules either in the French or Italian opera and the attachment we have to these compositions may at first sight be considered as a proof that the foregoing doctrine cannot be founded on human nature But the general  taste for operas is at bottom no authority against me In our operas the passions are so imperfectly expressed as to leave the mind free for relishing music of any sort indifferently It cannot be disguised that the pleasure of an opera is derived chiefly from the music and scarce at all from the sentiments A happy coincidence of emotions raised by the song and by the music is extremely rare and I venture to affirm that there is no example of it unless where the emotion raised by the former is pleasant as well as that raised by the latter  The subject we have run through appears not a little entertaining It is extremely curious to observe in many instances a plurality of causes producing in conjunction a great pleasure in other instances not less frequent no conjunction but each cause acting in opposition To enter bluntly upon a subject of such intricacy might gravel an acute philosopher and yet by taking matters in a train the intricacy vanisheth  Next in order according to the method proposed come external effects And this leads to passions in particular which involving  desire are the causes of action Two coexistent passions that have the same tendency must be similar They accordingly readily unite and in conjunction have double force which must hold whether the two passions have the same or different causes This is verified by experience from which we learn that different passions having the same end in view impel the mind to action with united force The mind receives not impulses alternately from these passions but one strong impulse from the whole in conjunction And indeed it is not easy to conceive what should bar the union of passions that have all of them the same tendency  Two passions having opposite tendencies may proceed from the same object or cause considered in different lights Thus a mistress may at once be the object both of love and resentment Her beauty inflames the passion of love her cruelty or inconstancy causes resentment When two such passions coexist in the same breast the opposition of their aim prevents any sort of union They are not felt otherwise than in succession  And the consequence must be one of two things the passions will balance each other and prevent external action or one of them will prevail and accomplish its end Guarini in his  Pastor Fido  describes beautifully the struggle betwixt love and resentment directed upon the same object  Corisca  Chi vide mai chi mai udi più strana  E più folle e più fera e più importuna  Passione amorosa amore ed odio

her son Meleager in a fit of passion She was strongly impelled to revenge but the criminal was her own son This ought to have withheld her hand But the story makes a better figure and is more interesting by the violence of the struggle betwixt resentment and maternal love  Dona Deûm templis nato victore ferebat  Cum videt extinctos fratres Althaea referri  Quae plangore dato moestis

after balancing betwixt them is an inchoated gratification of the prevailing passion which softens it in some degree This circumstance tends to give a superiority to the opposite passion And another circumstance also concurs that this opposite passion has by restraint acquired in the interim some additional force  Love and jealousy connected by a common object occupy the mind alternately When the object is considered as beautiful  love prevails when considered as possibly unfaithful jealousy prevails A situation of this kind affords great scope for fluctuation of passion which is painted to the life by several masterly hands in words as well as in colours Shakespear handles the same subject but in a manner uncommon and peculiar to himself In Othello's soliloquy before putting his wife to death love and jealousy are represented each exerting its whole force but without any struggle Othello was naturally inflexible and the tenderest love could not divert him from a purpose he approved as right not even for a moment But every thing consistent with such a character is done to reconcile the two opposite passions He is resolved to put her to death but he will not shed her blood nor so much as ruffle her skin  Othello  It is the cause it is the cause my soul  Let me not name it to you you chaste stars  It is the causeYet I'll not shed her blood  Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow  And smooth as monumental alabaster  Lays down the sword  Yet she must die else she'll betray more men  Put out the light and thenPut out the light  If I quench thee thou flaming minister  I can again thy former light restore  Should I repent but once put out  thy  light  Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature  I know not where is that Promethean heat  That can thy light relumine  Sets down the taper  When I have pluck'd thy rose  I cannot give it vital growth again  It needs must witherI'll smell thee on the tree  Kissing her  Oh balmy breath that dost almost persuade  Justice to break her swordOne more one more  Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee  And love thee afterOne more that's the last  So sweet was ne'er so fatal I must weep  But they are cruel tears this sorrow's heav'nly  It strikes where it doth loveShe wakes  Act sc  In Otway's  Orphan  we have an illustrious example of the address employed to gratify opposite passions directed upon the same object Castalio and Polydore brothers and rivals had sworn mutual confidence Castalio broke his faith by a private marriage By this concealment Polydore was unwarily betrayed into a dismal deed that of  polluting his brother's bed Thus he had injured his brother and was injured by him Justice prompted him to make full atonement by his own death resentment against his brother required a full atonement to be made to himself In coexistent passions so contradictory one of them commonly prevails after a struggle But here happily an expedient occurred to gratify both which was that Polydore should provoke his brother to put him to death Polydore's crime in his own opinion merited this punishment and justice was satisfied when he fell by the hands of the man he had injured He wanted at the same time to punish his brother for breach of faith and he could not do this more effectually than by betraying his brother to be his executioner  If difference of aim prevent the union of two passions though having the same object much more will it prevent their union when their objects are also different In both cases there is a fluctuation but in the latter the fluctuation is slower than in the former A beautiful situation of this kind is exhibited in the  Cid  of Corneille  Don Diegue an old soldier worn out with age having received a mortal affront from the Count father to Chimene employs his son Don Rodrigue Chimene's lover to demand satisfaction This situation occasions in the breast of Don Rodrigue a cruel struggle It is a contest betwixt love and honour one of which must be sacrificed The scene is finely conducted chiefly by making love in some degree take part with honour Don Rodrigue reflecting that if he lost his honour he could not deserve his mistress Honour triumphs The Count provoked to a single combat falls by the hand of Don Rodrigue  This produceth another beautiful situation respecting Chimene which for the sake of connection is placed here though it properly belongs to the foregoing head It became the duty of that lady to demand justice against her lover for whose preservation in other circumstances she chearfully would have sacrificed her own life The struggle betwixt these opposite passions directed upon the same object is finely expressed in the third scene of the third act  Elvire  Il vous prive d'un pére et vous l'aimez encore  Chimene  C'est peu de dire aimer Elvire je l'adore  Ma passion s'oppose à mon ressentiment  Dedans mon ennemi je trouve mon amant  Et je sens qu'en depit de toute ma colére  Rodrigue dans mon coeur combat encore mon pére  Il l'attaque il le presse il céde il se défend  Tantôt fort tantôt foible et tantôt triomphant  Mais en ce dur combat de colére et de flame  Il déchire mon coeur sans partager mon ame  Et quoique mon amour ait sur moi de pouvoir  Je ne consulte point pour suivre mon devoir  Je cours sans balancer où mon honneur m'oblige  Rodrigue m'est bien cher son interêt m'afflige  Mon coeur prend son parti mais malgré son effort  Je sai ce que je suis et que mon pére est mort  Not less when the objects are different than when the same are means sometimes afforded to gratify both passions and such means are greedily embraced In Tasso's  Gerusalem  Edward and Gildippe husband and wife are introduced fighting gallantly against the Saracens Gildippe receives a mortal wound by the hand of Soliman Edward inflamed with revenge as well as concern  for Gildippe is agitated betwixt the two different objects The poet  Canto st  describes him endeavouring to gratify both at once applying his right hand against Soliman the object of his resentment and his left hand to support his wife the object of his love  PART V The power of passion to adjust our opinions and belief to its gratification  THere is such a connection among the perceptions passions and actions of the same person that it would be wonderful if they should have no mutual influence That our actions are too much directed by passion is a sad truth It is not less certain though not so commonly observed that passion hath an irregular influence upon our opinions and belief The opinions we form of men and things are generally directed by affection An advice given by a man of figure hath great weight the  same advice from one in a low condition is utterly neglected A man of courage underrates danger and to the indolent the slightest obstacle appears unsurmountable Our opinions indeed the result commonly of various and often opposite views are so slight and wavering as readily to be susceptible of a bias from passion and prejudice  This subject is of great use in logic and of still greater use in criticism being intimately connected with many principles of the fine arts that will be unfolded in the course of this work Being too extensive to be treated here at large some cursory illustrations must suffice leaving the subject to be prosecuted more particularly afterward when occasion shall offer  Two principles that make an eminent figure in human nature concur to give passion an undue influence upon our opinions and belief The first and most extensive is a strong tendency in the mind to fit objects for the gratification of its passions We are prone to such opinions of men and things as correspond to our wishes Where the object in dignity or importance corresponds  to the passion bestowed on it the gratification is complete and there is no occasion for artifice But where the object is too mean for the passion so as not to afford a complete gratification it is wonderful how apt the mind is to impose upon itself and how disposed to proportion the object to its passion The other principle is a strong tendency in our nature to justify our passions as well as our actions not to others only but even to ourselves This tendency is extremely remarkable with respect to disagreeable passions By its influence objects are magnified or lessened circumstances supplied or suppressed every thing coloured and disguised to answer the end of justification Hence the foundation of selfdeceit where a man imposes upon himself innocently and even without suspicion of a bias  Beside the influence of the foregoing principles to make us form opinions contrary to truth the passions themselves by subordinate means contribute to the same effect Of these means I shall mention two which seem to be capital First There was occasion  formerly to observe  Chap  that though ideas seldom start up in the mind without connection yet that ideas which correspond to the present tone of the mind are readily suggested by any slight connection By this means the arguments for a favourite opinion are always at hand while we often search in vain for those that cross our inclination Second The mind taking delight in agreeable circumstances or arguments is strongly impressed with them while those that are disagreeable are hurried over so as scarce to make any impression The selfsame argument accordingly as it is relished or not relished weighs so differently as in truth to make conviction depend more on passion than on reasoning This observation is fully justified by experience To confine myself to a single instance the numberless absurd religious tenets that at different times have pestered the world would be altogether unaccountable but for this irregular bias of passion  We proceed to a more pleasant task  which is to illustrate the foregoing observations by proper examples Gratitude when warm is often exerted upon the children of the benefactor especially where he is removed out of reach by death or absence  See part sect of the present chapter  Gratitude in this case being exerted for the sake of the benefactor requires no peculiar excellence in his children To find however these children worthy of the benefits intended them contributes undoubtedly to the more entire gratification of the passion And accordingly the mind prone to gratify its passions is apt to conceive a better opinion of these children than possibly they deserve By this means strong connections of affection are often formed among individuals upon the slight foundation now mentioned  Envy is a passion which being altogether unjustifiable is always disguised under some more plausible name But no passion is more eager than envy to give its object such an appearance as to answer a complete gratification It magnifies every bad quality  and fixes on the most humbling circumstances  Cassius  I cannot tell what you and other men  Think of this life but for my single self  I had as lief not be as live to be  In awe of such a thing as I myself  I was born free as Caesar so were you  We both have fed as well and we can both  Endure the winter's cold as well as he  For once upon a raw and gusty day  The troubled Tyber chafing with his shores  Caesar says to me Dar'st thou Cassius now  Leap in with me into this angry flood  And swim to yonder pointUpon the word  Accoutred as I was I plunged in  And bid him follow so indeed he did  The torrent roar'd and we did buffet it  With lusty sinews throwing it aside  And stemming it with hearts of controversy  But ere we could arrive the point propos'd  Caesar cry'd Help me Cassius or I sink  I as Aeneas our great ancestor  Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder  The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tyber  Did I the tired Caesar and this man  Is now become a god and Cassius is  A wretched creature and must bend his body  If Caesar carelessly but nod on him  He had a fever when he was in Spain  And when the fit was on him I did mark  How he did shake 'Tis true this god did shake  His coward lips did from their colour fly  And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world  Did lose its lustre I did hear him grone  Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans  Mark him and write his speeches in their books  Alas it cry'dGive me some drink Titinius  As a sick girl Ye gods it doth amaze me  A man of such a feeble temper should  So get the start of the majestic world  And bear the palm alone  Julius Caesar act sc  Glo'ster inflamed with resentment against his son Edgar could even work himself into a momentary conviction that they were not related  O strange fasten'd villain  Would he deny his letterI never got him  King Lear act sc  When by a great sensibility of heart or  other means grief swells beyond what the cause can justify the mind is prone to magnify the cause in order to gratify the passion And if the real cause admit not of being magnified the mind seeks a cause for its grief in imagined future events  Bushy  Madam your Majesty is much too sad  You promis'd when you parted with the King  To lay aside selfharming heaviness  And entertain a chearful disposition  Queen  To please the King I did to please myself  I cannot do it Yet I know no cause  Why I should welcome such a guest as grief  Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest  As my sweet Richard yet again methinks  Some unborn sorrow ripe in Fortune's womb  Is coming tow'rd me and my inward soul  With something trembles yet at nothing grieves  More than with parting from my Lord the King  Richard II act sc  The foregoing examples depend on the first principle In the following both principles concur Resentment at first is wreaked on the relations of the offender in order  to punish him But as resentment when so outrageous is contrary to conscience the mind to justify its passion as well as to gratify it is disposed to paint these relations in the blackest colours and it actually comes to be convinced that they ought to be punished for their own demerits  Anger raised by an accidental stroke upon a tender part which gives great and sudden pain is sometimes vented upon the undesigning cause But as the passion in this case is absurd and as there can be no solid gratification in punishing the innocent the mind prone to justify as well as to gratify its passion deludes itself instantly into a conviction of the action's being voluntary This conviction however is but momentary the first reflection shows it to be erroneous and the passion vanisheth almost instantaneously with the conviction But anger the most violent of all passions has still greater influence It sometimes forces the mind to personify a stock or a stone when it occasions bodily pain in order to be a proper object of resentment A conception  is formed of it as a voluntary agent And that we have really a momentary conviction of its being a voluntary agent must be evident from considering that without such conviction the passion can neither be justified nor gratified The imagination can give no aid A stock or a stone may be imagined sensible but a notion of this kind cannot be the foundation of punishment so long as the mind is conscious that it is an imagination merely without any reality Of such personification involving a conviction of reality there is one illustrious instance When the

Act sc  The power of passion to falsify the computation of time is the more remarkable that time which hath an accurate measure is less obsequious to our desires and wishes than objects which have no precise standard of less or more  Even belief though partly an act of the judgment may be influenced by passion Good news are greedily swallowed upon very slender evidence Our wishes magnify the probability of the event as well as the veracity of the relater and we believe as certain what at best is doubtful  Quel che l' huom vede amor li fa invisible  E l' invisibil fa veder amore  Questo creduto fu che'l miser suole  Dar facile credenza a' quel che vuole  Orland Furios cant st  For the same reason bad news gain also credit upon the slightest evidence Fear if once alarmed has the same effect with  hope to magnify every circumstance that tends to conviction Shakespear who shows more knowledge of human nature than any of our philosophers hath in his  Cymbeline  Act sc  represented this bias of the mind for he makes the person who alone was affected with the bad news yield to evidence that did not convince any of his companions And Othello  Act sc  is convinced of his wife's infidelity from circumstances too slight to move an indifferent person  If the news interest us in so low a degree as to give place to reason the effect will not be quite the same Judging of the probability or improbability of the story the mind settles in a rational conviction either that it is true or not But even in this case it is observable that the mind is not allowed to rest in that degree of conviction which is produced by rational evidence If the news be in any degree favourable our belief is augmented by hope beyond its true pitch and if unfavourable by fear  The observation holds equally with respect to future events If a future event be either much wished or dreaded the mind to gratify its passion never fails to augment the probability beyond truth  The credit which in all ages has been given to wonders and prodigies even the most absurd and ridiculous is a strange phenomenon Nothing can be more evident than the following proposition That the more singular any event is the more evidence is required A familiar event daily occurring being in itself extremely probable finds ready credit and therefore is vouched by the slightest evidence But a strange and rare event contrary to the course of nature ought not to be easily believed It starts up without connection and without cause so far as we can discover and to overcome the improbability of such an event the very strongest evidence is required It is certain however that wonders and prodigies are swallowed by the vulgar upon evidence that would not be sufficient to ascertain the most familiar occurrence It has been reckoned difficult to  explain this irregular bias of the mind We are now no longer at a loss about its cause The proneness we have to gratify our passions which displays itself upon so many occasions produces this irrational belief A story of ghosts or fairies told with an air of gravity and truth raiseth an emotion of wonder and perhaps of dread These emotions tending strongly to their own gratification impose upon a weak mind and impress upon it a thorough conviction contrary to all sense and reason  Opinion and belief are influenced by propensity as well as by passion for the mind is disposed to gratify both A natural propensity is all we have to convince us that the operations of nature are uniform Influenced by this propensity we often rashly conceive that good or bad weather will never have an end and in natural philosophy writers influenced by the same propensity stretch commonly their analogical reasonings beyond just bounds  Opinion and belief are influenced by affection as well as by propensity The noted  story of a fine lady and a curate viewing the moon through a telescope is a pleasant illustration I perceive says the lady two shadows inclining to each other they are certainly two happy lovers Not at all replies the curate they are two steeples of a cathedral  APPENDIX to Part V Concerning the methods which nature hath afforded for computing time and space  I Introduce here the subject proposed because it affords several curious examples of the power of passion to adjust objects to its gratification a lesson that cannot be too much inculcated as there is not perhaps another bias in human nature that hath an influence so universal and that is so apt to make us wander from truth as well as from justice  I begin with time and the question shortly is What was the measure of time before artificial measures were invented  and What is the measure at present when these are not at hand I speak not of months and days which we compute by the moon and sun but of hours or in general of the time that runs betwixt any two occurrences when there is not access to the sun The only natural measure we have is the train of our thoughts and we always judge the time to be long or short in proportion to the number of perceptions that have passed through the mind during that interval This is indeed a very imperfect measure because in the different conditions of a quick or slow succession the computation is different But however imperfect it is the only measure by which a person naturally calculates time and this measure is applied on all occasions without regard to any occasional variation in the rate of succession  This natural measure of time imperfect as it is would however be tolerable did it labour under no other imperfection than the ordinary variations that happen in the motion of our perceptions But in many particular circumstances it is much more fallacious  and in order to explain these distinctly I must analize the subject Time is generally computed at two different periods one while time is passing another after it is past I shall consider these separately with the errors to which each of them is liable It will be found that these errors often produce very different computations of the same period of time The computation of time while it is passing comes first in order It is a common and trite observation That to lovers absence appears immeasurably long every minute an hour and every hour a day The same computation is made in every case where we long for a distant event as where one is in expectation of good news or where a profligate heir watches for the death of an old man who keeps him from a great estate Opposite to these are instances not fewer in number To a criminal the interval betwixt sentence and execution appears miserably short and the same holds in every case where one dreads an approaching event Of this even a schoolboy can bear witness the hour allowed him for play moves in his apprehension with a very swift pace before  he is thoroughly engaged the hour is gone A reckoning founded on the number of ideas will never produce computations so regularly opposite to each other for a slow succession of ideas is not connected with our wishes nor a quick succession with our fears What is it then that in the cases mentioned moves nature to desert her common measure for one very different I know not that this question ever has been resolved The false reckonings I have suggested are so common and familiar that no writer has thought of inquiring for their cause And indeed to enter upon this matter at short hand without preparation might occasion some difficulty But to encounter the difficulty we luckily are prepared by what is said above about the power of passion to fit objects for its gratification Among the other circumstances that terrify a condemned criminal the short time he has to live is one Terror like our other passions prone to its gratification adjusts every one of these circumstances to its own tone It magnifies in particular the shortness of the interval betwixt the present time  and that of the execution and forces upon the criminal a conviction that the hour of his death approaches with a swift pace In the same manner among the other distresses of an absent lover the time of separation is a capital circumstance which for that reason is greatly magnified by his anxiety and impatience He imagines that the time of meeting comes on very slow or rather that it will never come Every minute is thought of an intolerable length Here is a fair and I hope satisfactory account why we reckon time to be tedious when we long for a future event and not less fleet when we dread the event This account is confirmed by other instances Bodily pain fixt to one part produceth a slow train of perceptions which according to the common measure of time ought to make it appear short Yet we know that in such a state time has the opposite appearance Bodily pain is always attended with a degree of impatience and an anxiety to be rid of it which make us judge every minute to be an hour The same holds where the pain shifts from place to place but not so remarkably because such  a pain is not attended with the same degree of impatience The impatience a man hath in travelling through a barren country or in bad roads makes him imagine during the journey that time goes on with a very slow pace We shall show afterward that he makes a very different computation when his journey is at an end  How ought it to stand with a man who apprehends bad news It will probably be thought that the case of this man resembles that of a criminal who in reckoning the short time he has to live imagines every hour to be but a minute and that time flies swift away Yet the computation here is directly opposite Reflecting upon this difficulty there appears one capital circumstance in which the two cases differ The fate of the criminal is determined in the case under consideration the man is still in suspense Every one knows how distressful suspense is to the bulk of mankind Such distress we wish to get rid of at any rate even at the expence of bad news This case therefore upon a more narrow inspection resembles that of bodily pain  The present distress in both cases makes the time appear extremely tedious  The reader probably will not be displeased to have this branch of the subject illustrated in a pleasant manner by an author acquainted with every maze of the human heart and who bestows ineffable grace and ornament upon every subject he handles  Rosalinda  I pray you what is't a clock  Orlando  You should ask me what time o'day there's no clock in the forest  Ros  Then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock  Orla  Why not the swift foot of Time Had not that been as proper  Ros  By no means Sir Time travels

thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there  Orla  Whom stays it still withall  Ros  With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves  As you like it act sc  Reflecting upon the natural method of computing present time it shows how far from truth we may be led by the irregular power of passion Nor are our eyes immediately opened when the scene is past the deception continues while there remain any traces of the passion But looking back upon past time when the joy or distress is no  longer remembered the computation we make is very different In this situation passion being out of the question we apply the ordinary measure  viz  the course of our perceptions and I shall now proceed to the errors that this measure is subjected to In order to have an accurate notion of this matter we must distinguish betwixt a train of perceptions and a train of ideas Real objects make a strong impression and are faithfully remembered Ideas on the contrary however entertaining at the time are apt to escape an after recollection Hence it is that in retrospection the time that was employed upon real objects appears longer than the time that was employed upon ideas The former are more accurately recollected than the latter and we measure the time by the number that is recollected I proceed to particulars After finishing a journey through a populous country the frequency of agreeable objects distinctly recollected by the traveller makes the time spent in the journey appear to him longer than it was in reality This is chiefly remarkable in a first journey where every  object is new and makes a strong impression On the other hand after finishing a journey through a barren country thinly peopled the time appears short being measured by the number of objects which were few and far from interesting Here in both instances a reckoning is brought out directly opposite to that made during the journey And this by the way serves to account for a thing which may appear singular that in a barren country the computed miles are always longer than near the capital where the country is rich and populous The traveller has no natural measure of the space gone through other than the time bestowed upon it nor any natural measure of the time other than the number of his perceptions These being proportioned to the number of visible objects he imagines that he hath consumed more time on his day's journey and accomplished a greater number of miles in a populous than in a waste country By this method of calculation every computed mile in the former must in reality be shorter than in the latter  Again the travelling with an agreeable  companion produceth a short computation both of the road and of time especially if there be few objects that demand attention or if the objects be familiar The case is the same of young people at a ball or of a joyous company over a bottle The ideas with which they have been entertained being transitory escape the memory After all is over they reflect that they have been much diverted but scarce can say about what  When one is totally occupied in any agreeable work that admits not many objects time runs on without observation and upon an after recollection must appear short in proportion to the paucity of objects This is still more remarkable in close contemplation and in deep thinking where the train composed wholly of ideas proceeds with an extreme slow pace Not only are the ideas few in number but are apt to escape an afterreckoning The like false reckoning of time may proceed from an opposite state of mind In a reverie where ideas float at random without making any impression time goes on unheeded and the  reckoning is lost A reverie may be so profound as to prevent the recollection of any one idea that the mind was busied in a train of thinking will in general be remembered but what was the subject has quite escaped the memory In such a case we are altogether at a loss about the time we have no  data  for making a computation No cause produceth so false a reckoning of time as immoderate grief The mind in this state is violently attached to a single object and admits not a different thought Any other object breaking in is instantly banished so as scarce to give an appearance of succession In a reverie we are uncertain of the time that is past but in the example now given there is an appearance of certainty so far as the natural measure of time can be trusted that the time must have been short when the perceptions are so few in number  The natural measure of space appears more obscure than that of time I venture however to enter upon it leaving it to be further prosecuted if it be thought of any importance  The space marked out for a house appears considerably larger after it is divided into its proper parts A piece of ground appears larger after it is surrounded with a fence and still larger when it is made a garden and divided into different copartments  On the contrary a large plain looks less after it is divided into parts The sea must be excepted which looks less from that very circumstance of not being divided into parts  A room of a moderate size appears larger when properly furnished But when a very large room is furnished I doubt whether it be not lessened in appearance  A room of a moderate size looks less by having a ceiling lower than in proportion The same low ceiling makes a very large room look larger than it is in reality  These experiments are by far too small a stock for a general theory But they are all that occur at present and without attempting any regular system I shall satisfy myself with a few conjectures  The largest angle of vision seems to me  the natural measure of space The eye is the only judge and in examining with it the size of any plain or the length of any line the most accurate method that can be taken is to run over the object in parts The largest part that can be taken in at one stedfast look determines the largest angle of vision and when that angle is given one may institute a calculation by trying with the eye how many of these parts are in the whole  Whether this angle be the same in all men I know not The smallest angle of vision is ascertained and to ascertain the largest angle would not be less curious  But supposing it known it would be a very imperfect measure perhaps more so than the natural measure of time It requires great steadiness of eye to measure a line with any accuracy by applying to it the largest angle of distinctvision And suppose this steadiness to be acquired by practice the measure will be imperfect from other circumstances The space comprehended under this angle will be different according to the distance and also according to the situation of the object  Of a perpendicular this angle will comprehend the smallest space The space will be larger in looking upon an inclined plain and will be larger or less in proportion to the degree of inclination  This measure of space like the measure of time is liable to some extraordinary errors from certain operations of the mind which will account for some of the erroneous judgements above mentioned The space marked out for a dwellinghouse where the eye is at any reasonable distance is seldom greater than can be seen at once without moving the head Divide this space into two or three equal parts and none of these parts will appear much less than what can be comprehended at one distinct look consequently each of them will appear equal or nearly equal to what the whole did before the division If on the other hand the whole be very small so as scarce to fill the eye at one look its divisions into parts will I conjecture make it appear still less The minuteness of the parts is by an easy transition of ideas transferred to the whole Each part hath a diminutive appearance and by  the intimate connection of these parts with the whole we pass the same judgement upon all  The space marked out for a small garden is surveyed almost at one view and requires a motion of the eye so slight as to pass for an object that can be comprehended under the largest angle of distinct vision If not divided into too many parts we are apt to form the same judgement of each part and consequently to magnify the garden in proportion to the number of its parts  A very large plain without protuberances is an object not less rare than beautiful and in those who see it for the first time it must produce an emotion of wonder This emotion however slight tending to its own gratification imposes upon the mind and makes it judge that the plain is larger than it is in reality Divide this plain into parts and our wonder ceases It is no longer considered as one great plain but as so many different fields or inclosures  The first time one beholds the sea it appears to be large beyond all bounds When  it becomes familiar and raises our wonder in no degree it appears less than it is in reality In a storm it appears larger being distinguishable by the rolling waves into a number of great parts Islands scattered at considerable distances add in appearance to its size Each intercepted part looks extremely large and we silently apply arithmetic to increase the appearance of the whole Many islands scattered at hand give a diminutive appearance to the sea by its connection with its diminutive parts The Lomond lake would undoubtedly look larger without its islands  Furniture increaseth in appearance the size of a small room for the same reason that divisions increase in appearance the size of a garden The emotion of wonder which is raised by a very large room without furniture makes it look larger than it is in reality If completely furnished we view it in parts and our wonder is not raised  A low ceiling hath a diminutive appearance which by an easy transition of ideas is communicated to the length and breadth provided they bear any sort of proportion to  the height If they be out of all proportion the opposition seizes the mind and raises some degree of wonder which makes the difference appear greater than it really is  PART VI Of the resemblance emotions bear to their causes  THat many emotions bear a certain resemblance to their causes is a truth that can be made clear by induction though so far as I know the observation has not been made by any writer Motion in its different circumstances is productive of feelings that resemble it Sluggish motion for example causeth a languid unpleasant feeling slow uniform motion a feeling calm and pleasant and brisk motion a lively feeling that rouses the spirits and promotes activity A fall of water through rocks raises in the mind a tumultuous confused agitation extremely similar to its  cause When force is exerted with any effort the spectator feels a similar effort as of force exerted within his mind A large object swells the heart An elevated object makes the spectator stand erect  Sounds also produce emotions that resemble them A sound in a low key brings down the mind Such a sound in a full tone hath a certain solemnity which it communicates to the emotion produced by it A sound in a high key chears the mind by raising it Such a sound in a full tone both elevates and swells the mind  Again a wall or pillar that declines from the perpendicular produceth a painful emotion as of a tottering and falling within the mind An emotion somewhat similar is produced by a tall pillar that stands so ticklish as to look like falling For this reason a column upon a base looks better than upon the naked ground The base which makes a part of the column inspires a feeling of firmness and stability The ground supporting a naked column is too large to be considered as its base And for the same reason a cube as a base is preferred before  a cylinder though the latter is a more beautiful figure The angles of a cube being extended to a greater distance from the centre than the circumference of a cylinder give the column a greater appearance of stability This excludes not a different reason that the base shaft and capital of a pillar ought for the sake of variety to differ from each other If the shaft be round the base and capital ought to be square  A constrained posture uneasy to the man himself is disagreeable to the spectator which makes it a rule in painting that the drapery ought not to adhere to the body but hang loose that the figures may appear easy and free in their movements Hence the disagreeable figure of a French dancingmaster is one of Hogarth's pieces It is also ridiculous because the constraint is assumed and not forced  The foregoing observation is not confined to emotions raised by still life It holds also in those which are raised by the qualities actions and passions of a sensible being Love inspired by a fine woman assumes her qualities It is sublime soft tender  severe or gay according to its cause This is still more remarkable in emotions raised by human actions It hath already been remarked  Part of this chapter sect  that any signal instance of gratitude beside procuring esteem for the author raiseth in the spectator a vague emotion of gratitude which disposeth him to be grateful I now further remark that this vague emotion being of the same kind with what produced the grateful action hath a strong resemblance to its cause Courage exerted inspires the reader as well as the spectator with a like emotion of courage A just action fortifies our love to justice and a generous action rouses our generosity In short with respect to all virtuous actions it will be found by induction that they lead us to imitation by inspiring emotions resembling the passions that produced these actions And hence the benefit of dealing in choice books and in choice company  Grief as well as joy are infectious the emotions they raise in a spectator resemble  them perfectly Fear is equally infectious and hence in an army fear even from the slightest cause making an impression on a few spreads generally through all and becomes an universal panic Pity is similar to its cause A parting scene betwixt lovers or friends produceth in the spectator a sort of pity which is tender like the distress The anguish of remorse produceth pity of a harsh kind and if the remorse be extreme the pity hath a mixture of horror Anger I think is singular for even where it is moderate and causeth no disgust it disposes not the spectator to anger in any degree  Aristotle poet cap § says that anger raiseth in the spectator a similar emotion of anger  Covetousness cruelty treachery and other vicious passions are so far from raising any emotion similar to themselves to incite a spectator to imitation that they have an opposite effect They raise abhorrence and fortify the spectator in his aversion to such actions When anger is immoderate it cannot fail to produce the same effect  PART VII Final causes of the more frequent emotions and passions  IT is a law in our nature that we never act but by the impulse of desire which in other words is saying that it is passion by the desire included in it which determines the will Hence in the conduct of life it is of the utmost importance that our passions be directed upon proper objects tend to just and rational ends and with relation to each other be duly balanced The beauty of contrivance so conspicuous in the human frame is not confined to the rational part of our nature but is visible over the whole Concerning the passions in particular however irregular headstrong and perverse in an overly view they may appear I propose to show that they are by nature adjusted and tempered with admirable wisdom for the good of society as well as for private good  This subject is extensive but as the nature of the present undertaking will not admit a complete discussion it shall suffice to give a few observations in general upon the sensitive part of our nature without regarding that strange irregularity of passion discovered in some individuals Such topical irregularities if I may use the term cannot fairly be held an objection to the present theory We are frequently it is true misled by inordinate passion but we are also and perhaps not less frequently misled by wrong judgement  In order to a distinct apprehension of the present subject it must be premised that an agreeable object produceth always a pleasant emotion and a disagreeable object one that is painful This is a general law of nature which admits not a single exception Agreeableness in the object or cause is indeed so essentially connected with pleasure in the emotion its effect that an agreeable object cannot be better defined than by its power of producing a pleasant emotion Disagreeableness in the object or cause has  the same necessary connection with pain in the emotion produced by it  From this preliminary it appears that to inquire for what end an emotion is made pleasant or painful resolves into an inquiry for what end its cause is made agreeable or disagreeable And from the most accurate induction it will be discovered that no cause of an emotion is made agreeable or disagreeable arbitrarily but that these qualities are so distributed as to answer wise and good purposes It is an invincible proof of the benignity of the Deity that we are surrounded with things generally agreeable which contribute remarkably to our entertainment and to our happiness Some things are made disagreeable such as a rotten carcass because they are noxious Others a dirty marsh for example or a barren heath are made disagreeable in order to excite our industry And with respect to the few things that are neither agreeable nor disagreeable it will be made evident that their being left indifferent is not a work of chance but of wisdom Of such I shall have occasion to give several instances  Having attempted to assign the final causes of emotions and passions considered as pleasant or painful we proceed to the final causes of the desires involved in them This seems a work of some difficulty for the desires that accompany different passions have very different aims and seldom or never demand precisely the same gratification One passion moves us to cling to its object one to fly from it one passion impels to action for our own good and one for the good of others one passion prompts us to do good to ourselves or others and one to do mischief frequently to others and sometimes even to ourselves Deliberating upon this intricate subject and finding an intimate correspondence betwixt our desires and their objects it is natural to think that the former must be regulated in some measure by the latter In this view I begin with desire directed upon an inanimate object  Any pleasure we have in an agreeable object of this kind is enjoyed by the continuance of the pleasant impression it makes upon us and accordingly the desire involved in  the pleasant emotion tends to that end and is gratified by dwelling upon the agreeable object Hence such an object may be properly termed  attractive  Thus a flowing river a towering hill a fine garden are attractive objects They fix the attention of the spectator by inspiring pleasant emotions which are gratified by adhering to these objects and enjoying them On the other hand a disagreeable object of the same kind raises in us a painful emotion including a desire to turn from the object which relieves us of course from the pain and hence such an object may be properly termed  repulsive  A monstrous birth for example a rotten carcass a confusion of jarring sounds are repulsive They repel the mind by inspiring painful or unpleasant emotions which are gratified by flying from such objects Thus in general with regard to inanimate objects the desire included in every pleasant passion tends to prolong the pleasure and the desire included in every painful passion tends to put an end to the pain Here the final cause is evident Our desires so far are modelled  in such a manner as to correspond precisely to the sensitive part of our nature prone to happiness and averse to misery These operations of adhering to an agreeable inanimate object and flying from one that is disagreeable are performed in the beginning of life by means of desire impelling us without the intervention of reason or reflection Reason and reflection directing selflove become afterward motives that unite their force with desire because experience informs us that the adhering to agreeable objects and the flying from those that are disagreeable contribute to our happiness  Sensible Beings considered as objects of passion lead us into a more complex theory A sensible being that is agreeable by its attributes inspires us with a pleasant emotion and the desire included in this emotion has evidently different means of gratification A man regarding himself only may be satisfied with viewing and contemplating this being precisely as if it were inanimate or he may desire the more generous gratification of making it happy Were man altogether  selfish it would be conformable to his nature that he should indulge the pleasant emotion without making any acknowledgement to the person who gives him pleasure more than to a pure air or temperate clime when he enjoys these benefits But as man is endued with a principle of benevolence as well as of selfishness he is prompted by his nature to desire the good of every sensible being that gives him pleasure And the final cause of desire so directed is illustrious It contributes to a man's own happiness by affording him more means of gratification than he can have when his desire terminates upon himself alone and at the same time it tends eminently to improve the happiness of those with whom he is connected The directing our desires in this manner occasions a beautiful coalition of selflove with benevolence for both are equally promoted by the same internal impulse and by the same external conduct And this consideration by the way ought to silence those minute philosophers who ignorant of human nature teach a most disgustful doctrine That to  serve others unless with a view to our own good is weakness and folly as if selflove only contributed to happiness and not benevolence The hand of God is too visible in the human frame to permit us to think seriously that there ever can be any jarring or inconsistency among natural principles those especially of selflove and benevolence which regulate the bulk of our actions  Next in order come sensible Beings that are in affliction or pain It is disagreeable to behold a person in distress and therefore this object must raise in the spectator an uneasy emotion Were man purely a selfish being he would be prompted by his nature to turn from every object animate or inanimate that gives him uneasiness But the principle of benevolence gives an opposite direction to his desire It impels him to afford relief and by relieving the person from distress his desire is fully gratified Our benevolence to a person in distress is inflamed into an emotion of sympathy signifying in Greek the painful emotion that is raised in us by that person  Thus sympathy though a painful emotion is in its nature attractive And with respect to its final cause we can be at no loss It not only tends to relieve a fellowcreature from pain but in its gratification is greatly more pleasant than if it were repulsive  We in the last place bring under consideration persons hateful by vice or wickedness Imagine a wretch who has lately perpetrated some horrid crime he is disagreeable to every spectator and consequently raises in every spectator a painful emotion What is the natural gratification of the desire that accompanies this painful emotion I must here again observe that supposing man to be entirely a selfish being he would be prompted by his nature to relieve himself from the pain by averting his eye and banishing the criminal from his thoughts But man is not so constituted He is composed of many principles which though seemingly contradictory are perfectly concordant The principle of benevolence influences his conduct not less remarkably than that of selfishness And in order to  answer the foregoing question I must introduce a third principle not less remarkable in its influence than either of those mentioned It is that principle common to all which prompts us to punish those who do wrong An envious malicious or cruel action is disagreeable to me even where I have no connection with the sufferer and raises in me the painful emotion of resentment The gratification of this emotion when accompanied with desire is directed by the principle now unfolded Being prompted by my nature to punish guilt as well as to reward virtue my desire is not gratified but by inflicting punishment I must chastise the wretch by indignation at least and hatred if not more severely Here the final cause is selfevident  An injury done to myself touching me more than when done to others raises my resentment in a higher degree The desire accordingly included in this passion is not satisfied with so slight a punishment as indignation or hatred It is not fully gratified without retaliation and the author must by my hand suffer mischief as great at least  as he has done me Neither can we be at any loss about the final cause of this higher degree of resentment The whole vigor of this passion is required to secure individuals from the injustice and oppression of others  See Historical lawtracts tract    A wicked or disgraceful action is disagreeable not only to others but even to the delinquent himself It raises in him as well as in others a painful emotion including a desire of punishment The painful emotion which the delinquent feels is distinguished by the name of  remorse  and in this case the desire he has to punish is directed against himself There cannot be imagined a better contrivance to deter us from vice for remorse is the severest of all punishments This passion and the desire of selfpunishment derived from it are touched delicately by Terence  Menedemus  Ubi comperi ex iis qui ei fuere conscii  Domum revortor moestus atque animo fere  Perturbato atque incerto prae aegritudine  Adsido adcurrunt servi soccos detrahunt  Video alios festinare lectos sternere  Coenam adparare pro se quisque sedulo  Faciebat quo illam mihi lenirent miseriam  Ubi video haec coepi cogitare Hem tot mea  Solius solliciti sint causa ut me unum expleant  Ancillae tot me vestiant sumptus domi  Tantos ego solus faciam sed gnatum unicum  Quem pariter uti his decuit aut etiam amplius  Quod illa aetas magis ad haec utenda idonea 'st  Eum ego hinc ejeci miserum injustitia mea  Malo quidem me dignum quovis deputem  Si id faciam nam usque dum ille vitam illam colet  Inopem carens patria ob meas injurias  Interea usque illi de me supplicium dabo  Laborans quaerens parcens illi serviens  Ita facio prorsus nihil relinquo in

the sun to these unhappy eyes  Ne'er shine again but be eclips'd for ever  May every thing I look on seem a prodigy  To fill my soul with terror till I quite  Forget I ever had humanity  And grow a curser of the works of nature  Orphan act  The cases mentioned are where benevolence alone or where desire of punishment alone governs without a rival And it was necessary to handle these cases separately in order to elucidate a subject which by writers is left in great obscurity But neither of these principles operates always without rivalship Cases may be figured and cases actually exist where the same person is an object both of sympathy and of desire to punish Thus the sight of a profligate in the venereal disease overrun with botches and fores actuates both principles While his distress fixes my attention sympathy exerts  itself but so soon as I think of his profligacy hatred prevails and a desire to punish This in general is the case of distress occasioned by immoral actions that are not highly criminal And if the distress and the immoral action be in any proportion sympathy and hatred counterbalancing each other will not suffer me either to afford relief or to inflict punishment What then will be the result of the whole The principle of selflove solves the question Abhorring an object so loathsome I naturally avert my eye and walk off as fast as I can in order to be relieved from the pain  The present subject gives birth to several other observations for which I could not find room above without relaxing more from the strictness of order and connection than with safety could be indulged in discoursing upon a matter that with difficulty is made perspicuous even with all the advantages of order and connection These observations I shall throw out loosely as they occur without giving myself any further trouble about method  No action good or bad is altogether indifferent  even to a mere spectator If good it inspires esteem and indignation if wicked But it is remarkable that these emotions seldom are accompanied with desire The abilities of man are limited and he finds sufficient employment in relieving the distressed in requiting his benefactors and in punishing those who wrong him without moving out of his own sphere for the benefit or chastisement of those with whom he has no connection  If the good qualities of others excite my benevolence the same qualities in myself must produce a similar effect in a superior degree upon account of the natural partiality every man hath for himself This increases selflove If these qualities be of a high rank they produce a feeling of superiority which naturally leads me to assume some sort of government over others Mean qualities on the other hand produce in me a feeling of inferiority which naturally leads me to submit to others Unless such feelings were distributed among individuals in society by measure and proportion there could be no natural subordination of some  to others which is the principal foundation of government  No other branch of the human constitution shows more visibly our destination for society nor tends more to our improvement than appetite for fame or esteem The whole conveniencies of life being derived from mutual aid and support in society it ought to be a capital aim to form connections with others so strict and so extensive as to produce a firm reliance on many for succour in time of need Reason dictates this lesson But reason solely is not relied on in a matter of such consequence We are moved by a natural appetite to be solicitous about esteem and respect as we are about food when hungry This appetite at the same time is finely adjusted to the moral branch of our constitution by promoting all the moral virtues For what infallible means are there to attract love and esteem other than a virtuous course of life If a man be just and beneficent if he be temperate modest and prudent he will infallibly gain the esteem and love of all who know him  The communication of passion to related  objects is an illustrious instance of the care of Providence to extend social connections as far as the limited nature of man can admit This communication of passion is so far unhappy as to spread the malevolent passions beyond their natural bounds But let it be remarked that this unhappy effect regards savages only who give way to malevolent passions Under the discipline of society these passions are subdued and in a good measure eradicated In their place succeed the kindly affections which meeting with all encouragement take possession of the mind and govern our whole actions In this condition the progress of passion along related objects by spreading the kindly affections through a multitude of individuals hath a glorious effect  Nothing can be more entertaining to a rational mind than the oeconomy of the human passions of which I have attempted to give some faint notion It must however be confessed that our passions when they happen to swell beyond their proper limits take on a less regular appearance Reason may proclaim our duty but the will influenced  by passion makes gratification always welcome Hence the power of passion which when in excess cannot be resisted but by the utmost fortitude of mind It is bent upon gratification and where proper objects are wanting it clings to any object at hand without distinction Thus joy inspired by a fortunate event is diffused upon every person around by acts of benevolence and resentment for an atrocious injury done by one out of reach seizes the first object that occurs to vent itself upon Those who believe in prophecies even wish the accomplishment and a weak mind is disposed voluntarily to fulfil a prophecy in order to gratify its wish Shakespear whom no particle of human nature hath escaped however remote from common observation describes this weakness  K Henry  Doth any name particular belong  Unto that lodging where I first did swoon  Warwick  'Tis call'd  Jerusalem  my Noble Lord  K Henry  Laud be to God even there my life must end  It hath been prophesy'd to me many years  I should not die but in Jerusalem  Which vainly I suppos'd the holy land  But bear me to that chamber there I'll lie  In that Jerusalem shall Henry die  Second part Henry IV act sc last  I could not deny myself the amusement of the foregoing observation though it doth not properly come under my plan The irregularities of passion proceeding from peculiar weaknesses and biasses I do not undertake to justify and of these we have had many examples  Part of the present chapter  It is sufficient that passions common to all and as generally exerted are made subservient to beneficial purposes I shall only observe that in a polished society instances of irregular passions are rare and that their mischief doth not extend far  CHAP III BEAUTY  HAVING discoursed in general of emotions and passions I proceed to a more narrow inspection of some particulars that serve to unfold the principles of the fine arts It is the province of a writer upon ethics to give a full enumeration of all the passions and of each separately to assign the nature the cause the gratification and the effects But a treatise of ethics is not my province I carry my view no farther than to the elements of criticism in order to show that the fine arts are a subject of reasoning as well as of taste An extensive work would be ill suited to a design so limited and to keep within moderate bounds the following plan may contribute It has already been observed that things are the causes of emotions by means of their properties and attributes  Chap part sect first note  This  furnisheth a hint for distribution Instead of a painful and tedious examination of the several passions and emotions I propose to confine my inquiries to such attributes relations and circumstances as in the fine arts are chiefly employed to raise agreeable emotions Attributes of single objects as the most simple shall take the lead to be followed with particulars that depend on the relations of objects and are not found in any one object singly considered Dispatching next some coincident matters I approach nearer to practice by applying the principles unfolded in the foregoing parts of the work This is a general view of the intended method reserving however a privilege to vary it in particular instances where a different method may be more commodious I begin with beauty the most noted of all the qualities that belong to single objects  The term  beauty  in its native signification is appropriated to objects of sight Objects of the other senses may be agreeable such as the sounds of musical instruments the smoothness and softness of some  surfaces but the agreeableness denominated  beauty  belongs to objects of sight  Of all the objects of the external senses an object of sight is the most complex In the very simplest colour is perceived figure and length breadth and thickness A tree is composed of a trunk branches and leaves It has colour figure size and sometimes motion By means of each of these particulars separately considered it appears beautiful how much more so when they enter all into one complex perception The beauty of the human figure is extraordinary being a composition of numberless beauties arising from the parts and qualities of the object various colours various motions figure size  c  all uniting in one complex perception and striking the eye with combined force Hence it is that beauty a quality so remarkable in visible objects lends its name to express every thing that is eminently agreeable Thus by a figure of speech we say a beautiful sound a beautiful thought or expression a beautiful theorem a beautiful event a beautiful discovery in art or science  But as figurative expression is not our present theme this chapter is confined to beauty in its genuine signification  It is natural to suppose that a perception so various as that of beauty comprehending sometimes many particulars sometimes few should occasion emotions equally various And yet all the various emotions of beauty maintain one general character of sweetness and gaiety  Considering attentively the beauty of visible objects we discover two kinds One may be termed  intrinsic  beauty because it is discovered in a single object viewed apart without relation to any other object The examples above given are of that kind The other may be termed  relative  beauty being founded on the relation of objects The former is a perception of sense merely for to perceive the beauty of a spreading oak or of a flowing river no more is required but singly an act of vision The latter is accompanied with an act of understanding and reflection for of a fine instrument or engine we perceive not the relative beauty until we be made acquainted with its use and  destination In a word intrinsic beauty is ultimate relative beauty is that of means relating to some good end or purpose These different beauties agree in one capital circumstance that both are equally perceived as spread upon the object This will be readily admitted with respect to intrinsic beauty but is not so obvious with respect to the other The utility of the plough for example may make it an object of admiration or of desire but why should utility make it appear beautiful A principle mentioned above  Chap part sect  will explain this doubt The beauty of the effect by an easy transition of ideas is transferred to the cause and is perceived as one of the qualities of the cause Thus a subject void of intrinsic beauty appears beautiful from its utility An old Gothic tower that has no beauty in itself appears beautiful considered as proper to defend against an enemy A dwellinghouse void of all regularity is however beautiful in the view of convenience and the want of form or symmetry in a tree  will not prevent its appearing beautiful if it be known to produce good fruit  When these two beauties concur in any object it appears delightful Every member of the human body possesses both in a high degree The slender make of a horse destined for running pleases every taste partly from symmetry and partly from utility  The beauty of utility being proportioned accurately to the degree of utility requires no illustration But intrinsic beauty so complex as I have said cannot be handled distinctly without being analized into its constituent parts If a tree be beautiful by means of its colour its figure its size its motion it is in reality possessed of so many different beauties which ought to be examined separately in order to have a clear notion of the whole The beauty of colour is too familiar to need explanation The beauty of figure requires an accurate discussion for in it many circumstances are involved When any portion of matter is viewed as a whole the beauty of its figure arises from regularity and simplicity Viewing  the parts with relation to each other uniformity proportion and order contribute to its beauty The beauty of motion deserves a chapter by itself and another chapter is destined for grandeur being distinguishable from beauty in a strict sense For the definitions of regularity uniformity proportion and order if thought necessary I remit my reader to the appendix at the end of the book Upon simplicity I must make a few cursory observations such as may be of use in examining the beauty of single objects  A multitude of objects crowding into the mind at once disturb the attention and pass without making any impression or any lasting impression In a group no single object makes the figure it would do apart when it occupies the whole attention  See the appendix containing definitions and explanation of terms  For the same reason even a single object when it divides the attention by the multiplicity of its parts equals not in strength of impression a more simple object comprehended  in a single view Parts extremely complex must be considered in portions successively and a number of impressions in succession which cannot unite because not simultaneous never touch the mind like one entire impression made as it were at one stroke This justifies simplicity in works of art as opposed to complicated circumstances and crowded ornaments There is an additional reason for simplicity in works that make an impression of dignity or elevation The mind attached to beauties of a high rank cannot descend to inferior beauties And yet notwithstanding these reasons we find profuse decoration prevailing in works of art But this is no argument against simplicity For authors and architects who cannot reach the higher beauties endeavour to supply their want of genius by dealing in those that are inferior In all ages the best writers and artists have been governed by a taste for simplicity  These things premised I proceed to examine the beauty of figure as arising from the abovementioned particulars  viz  regularity  uniformity proportion order and simplicity To exhaust this subject would of itself require a large volume I limit myself to a few cursory remarks as matter for future disquisition To inquire why an object by means of the particulars mentioned appears beautiful would I am afraid be a vain attempt It seems the most probable opinion that the nature of man was originally framed with a relish for them in order to answer wise and good purposes The final causes have not hitherto been ascertained though they are not probably beyond our reach One thing is clear that regularity uniformity order and simplicity contribute each of them to readiness of apprehension and enable us to form more distinct images of objects than can be done with the utmost attention where these particulars are not found This final cause is I acknowledge too slight to account satisfactorily for a taste that makes a figure so illustrious in the nature of man That this branch of our constitution hath a purpose still more important we have great reason to believe With respect to proportion I  am still less successful In several instances accurate proportion is connected with utility This in particular is the case of animals for those that are the best proportioned are the strongest and most active But instances are still more numerous where the proportions we relish the most have no connection so far as we see with utility Writers on architecture insist much upon the proportions of a column and assign different proportions to the Doric Ionic and Corinthian But no architect will maintain that the most accurate proportions contribute more to use than several that are less accurate and less agreeable Neither will it be maintained that the proportions assigned for the length breadth and height of rooms tend to make them the more commodious It appears then so far as we can discover that we have a taste for proportion independent altogether of utility One thing indeed is certain that any external object proportioned to our taste is delightful This furnishes a hint May it not be thought a good final cause of proportion that it contributes to our entertainment The author of our  nature has given many signal proofs that this end is not below his care And if so why should we hesitate in assigning this as an additional final cause of regularity and the other particulars above mentioned We may be confirmed in this thought by reflecting that our taste with respect to these is not occasional or accidental but uniform and universal making an original branch of human nature  One might fill a volume with the effects that are produced by the endless combinations of the principles of beauty I have room only for a slight specimen confined to the simplest figures A circle and a square are each of them perfectly regular being equally confined to a precise form and admitting not the slightest variation A square however is less beautiful than a circle because it is less simple A circle has parts as well as a square but its parts not being distinct like those of a square it makes one entire impression whereas the attention is divided among the sides and angles of a square The effect of simplicity may be illustrated by another example A square though not  more regular than a hexagon or octagon is more beautiful than either for what other reason than that a square is more simple and the attention less divided This reasoning will appear still more solid when we consider any regular polygon of very many sides for of such figure the mind can never have any distinct perception Simplicity thus contributes to beauty  A square is more beautiful than a parallelogram The former exceeds the latter in regularity and in uniformity of parts But this holds with respect to intrinsic beauty only for in many instances utility comes in to cast the balance on the side of the parallelogram This figure for the doors and windows of a dwellinghouse is preferred because of utility and here we find the beauty of utility prevailing over that of regularity and uniformity  A parallelogram again depends for its beauty on the proportion of its sides The beauty is lost by a great inequality of sides It is also lost on the other hand by the approximation toward equality Proportion in this circumstance degenerates into imperfect  uniformity and the figure upon the whole appears an unsuccessful attempt toward a square  An equilateral triangle yields not to a square in regularity nor in uniformity of parts and it is more simple But an equilateral triangle is less beautiful than a square which must be owing to inferiority of order in the position of its parts The sides of an equilateral triangle incline to each other in the same angle which is the most perfect order they are susceptible of But this order is obscure and far from being so perfect as the parallelism of the sides of a square Thus order contributes to the beauty of visible objects not less than simplicity and regularity  A parallelogram exceeds an equilateral triangle in the orderly disposition of its parts but being inferior in uniformity and simplicity it is less beautiful  Uniformity is singular in one capital circumstance that it is apt to disgust by excess A number of things contrived for the same use such as chairs spoons  c  cannot be too uniform But a scrupulous uniformity  of parts in a large garden or field is far from being agreeable Uniformity among connected objects belongs not to the present subject It is handled in the chapter of uniformity and variety  In all the works of nature simplicity makes an illustrious figure The works of the best artists are directed by it Profuse ornament in painting gardening or architecture as well as in dress and language shows a mean or corrupted taste  Poets like painters thus unskill'd to trace  The naked nature and the living grace  With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part  And hide with ornaments their want of art  Pope's Essay on criticism  No one property recommends a machine more than its simplicity not singly for better answering its purpose but by appearing in itself more beautiful Simplicity hath a capital effect in behaviour and manners no other particular contributing more to gain esteem and love The artificial and intricate manners of modern times have little of  dignity in them General theorems abstracting from their importance are delightful by their simplicity and by the easiness of their application to a variety of cases We take equal delight in the laws of motion which with the greatest simplicity are boundless in their influence  A gradual progress from simplicity to complex forms and profuse ornament seems to be the fate of all the fine arts resembling behaviour which from original candor and simplicity has degenerated into artificial refinements At present written productions are crowded with words epithets figures  c  In music sentiment is neglected for the luxury of harmony and for difficult movement which surprises in its execution In  taste  properly so called poignant sauces with complicated mixtures of different savours prevail among people of condition The French accustomed to the artificial red on their women's cheeks think the modest colouring of nature displayed on a fine face altogether insipid  The same tendency appears in the progress of the arts among the ancients Of  this we have traces still remaining in architecture Some vestiges of the oldest Grecian buildings prove them to be of the Doric order The Ionic succeeded and seems to have been the favourite order while architecture was in its height of glory The Corinthian came next in vogue and in Greece the buildings of that order appear mostly to have been erected after the Romans got footing there At last came the Composite with all its extravagancies where proportion is sacrificed to finery and crowded ornament  But what taste is to prevail next for fashion is in a continual flux and taste must vary with it After rich and profuse ornaments become familiar simplicity appears by contrast lifeless and insipid This would be an unsurmountable obstruction should any man of genius and taste endeavour to restore ancient simplicity  In reviewing what is said above I am under some apprehension of an objection which as it may possibly occur to the reader ought to be obviated A mountain it will be observed is an agreeable object  without so much as the appearance of regularity and a chain of mountains still more agreeable without being arranged in any order But these facts considered in a proper light afford not an objection Regularity order and uniformity are intimately connected with beauty and in this view only have I treated them Every regular object for example must in respect of its regularity be beautiful But I have not said that regularity order and uniformity are essential to beauty so as that it cannot exist without them The contrary appears in the beauty of colour Far less have I said that an object cannot be agreeable in any respect independent of these qualities Grandeur as distinguished from beauty requires very little regularity This will appear more fully when that article is handled In the mean time to show the difference betwixt beauty and grandeur with respect to regularity I shall give a few examples Imagine a small body let it be a globe in a continual flux of figure from the most perfect regularity till there remain no appearance of that quality The beauty of this globe  depending on its regular figure will gradually wear away with its regularity and when it is no longer regular it no longer will appear beautiful The next example shall be of the same globe gradually enlarging its size but retaining its figure In this body we at first perceive the beauty of regularity only But so soon as it begins to swell into a great size it appears agreeable by its greatness which joins with the beauty of regularity to make it a delightful object In the last place let it be imagined that the figure as well as the quantity of matter are in a continual flux and that the body while it increases in size becomes less and less regular till it lose altogether the appearance of that quality In this case the beauty of regularity wearing off gradually gives place to an agreeableness of a different sort  viz  that of greatness and at last the emotion arising from greatness will be in perfection when the beauty of regularity is gone Hence it is that in a large object the want of regularity is not much regarded by the spectator who is struck with its grandeur A swelling eminence is agreeable though not strictly  regular A towering hill is delightful if it have but any distant resemblance of a cone A small surface ought to be smooth but in a wideextended plain considerable inequalities are overlooked This observation holds equally in works of art The slightest irregularity in a house of a moderate size hurts the eye while the mind struck with the grandeur of a superb edifice which occupies it totally cannot bear to descend to its irregularities unless extremely gross In a large volume we pardon many defects that would make an epigram intolerable In short the observation holds in general that beauty is connected with regularity in great objects as well as in small but with a remarkable difference that in passing from small to great regularity is less and less required  The distinction betwixt primary and secondary qualities in matter seems now fully established Heat and cold though seeming to exist in bodies are discovered to be effects caused by these bodies in a sensitive being Colour which the eye represents as spread upon a substance has no existence  but in the mind of the spectator Perceptions of this kind which by a delusion of sense are attributed to external subjects are termed  secondary qualities  in contradistinction to figure extension solidity which are primary qualities and which are not separable even in imagination from the subjects they belong to This suggests a curious inquiry Whether beauty be a primary or only a secondary quality of objects The question is easily determined with respect to the beauty of colour for if colour be a secondary quality existing no where but in the mind of the spectator its beauty must be of the same kind This conclusion must also hold with respect to the beauty of utility which is plainly a conception of the mind arising not merely from sight but from reflecting that the thing is fitted for some good end or purpose The question is more intricate with respect to the beauty of regularity If regularity be a primary quality why not also its beauty That this is not a good consequence will appear from considering that beauty in its very conception refers to a percipient for  an object is said to be beautiful for no other reason but that it appears so to a spectator The same piece of matter which to man appears beautiful may possibly to another being appear ugly Beauty therefore which for its existence depends upon the percipient as much as upon the object perceived cannot be an inherent property of either What else then can it be but a perception in the mind occasioned by certain objects The same reasoning is applicable to the beauty of order of uniformity of grandeur Accordingly it may be pronounced in general that beauty in no case whatever is a real quality of matter And hence it is wittily observed by the poet that beauty is not in the countenance but in the lover's eye This reasoning is undoubtedly solid and the only cause of doubt or hesitation is that we are taught a different lesson by sense By a singular determination of nature we perceive both beauty and colour as belonging to the object and like figure or extension as inherent properties This mechanism is uncommon and when nature to fulfil her intention chuseth any  singular method of operation we may be certain of some final cause that cannot be reached by ordinary means It appears to me that a perception of beauty in external objects is requisite to attach us to them Doth not this mechanism in the first place greatly promote industry by prompting a desire to possess things that are beautiful Doth it not further join with utility in prompting us to embellish our houses and enrich our fields These however are but slight effects compared with the connections which are formed among individuals in society by means of this singular mechanism The qualifications of the head and heart are undoubtedly the most solid and most permanent foundations of such connections But as external beauty lies more in view and is more obvious to the bulk of mankind than the qualities now mentioned the sense of beauty possesses the more universal influence in forming these connections At any rate it concurs in an eminent degree with mental qualifications to produce social intercourse mutual goodwill  and consequently mutual aid and support which are the life of society  It must not however be overlooked that this sense doth not tend to advance the interests of society but when in a due mean with respect to strength Love in particular arising from a sense of beauty loses when excessive its sociable character  See chap part sect  The appetite for gratification prevailing over affection for the beloved object is ungovernable and tends violently to its end regardless of the misery that must follow Love in this state is no longer a sweet agreeable passion It becomes painful like hunger or thirst and produceth no happiness but in the instant of fruition This discovery suggests a most important lesson that moderation in our desires and appetites which fits us for doing our duty contributes at the same time the most to happiness Even social passions when moderate are more pleasant than when they swell beyond proper bounds  CHAP IV Grandeur and Sublimity  NATURE hath not more remarkably distinguished us from the other animals by an erect posture than by a capacious and aspiring mind inclining us to every thing great and elevated The ocean the sky or any large object seizes the attention and makes a strong impression  Longinus observes that nature inclines us to admire not a small rivulet however clear and transparent but the Nile the Ister the Rhine or still more the ocean The sight of a small fire produceth no emotion but we are struck with the boiling furnaces of Aetna pouring out whole rivers of liquid flame  Treatise of the Sublime    chap    Robes of state are made large and full to draw respect We admire elephants and whales for their magnitude notwithstanding their unwieldiness  The elevation of an object affects us not less than its magnitude A high place is chosen for the statue of a deity or hero  A tree growing upon the brink of a precipice viewed from the plain below affords by that circumstance an additional pleasure A throne is erected for the chief magistrate and a chair with a high seat for the president of a court  In some objects greatness and elevation concur to make a complicated impression The Alps and the pike of Teneriff are proper examples with the following difference that in the former greatness seems to prevail elevation in the latter  The emotions raised by great and by elevated objects are clearly distinguishable not only in the internal feeling but even in their external expressions A great object dilates the breast and makes the spectator endeavour to enlarge his bulk This is remarkable in persons who neglecting delicacy in behaviour give way to nature without reserve In describing a great object they naturally expand themselves by drawing in air with all their force An elevated object produces a different expression It makes the spectator stretch upward and stand a tiptoe  Great and elevated objects considered with relation to the emotions produced by them are termed  grand  and  sublime  Grandeur and sublimity have a double signification They generally signify the quality or circumstance in the objects by which the emotions are produced sometimes the emotions themselves  Whether magnitude singly in an object of sight have the effect to produce an emotion distinguishable from the beauty or deformity of that object or whether it be only a circumstance modifying the beauty or deformity is an intricate question If magnitude produce an emotion of its own distinguishable from others this emotion must either be pleasant or painful But this seems to be contradicted by experience for magnitude as it would appear contributes in some instances to beauty in some to deformity A hill for instance is agreeable and a great mountain still more so But an ugly monster the larger the more horrid Greatness in an enemy great power great courage serve but to augment our terror Hath not  this an appearance as if grandeur were not an emotion distinct from all others but only a circumstance that qualifies beauty and deformity  I am notwithstanding satisfied that grandeur is an emotion not only distinct from all others but in every circumstance pleasant These propositions must be examined separately I begin with the former and shall endeavour to prove that magnitude produceth a peculiar emotion distinguishable from all others Magnitude is undoubtedly a real property of bodies not less than figure and more than colour Figure and colour even in the same body produce separate emotions which are never misapprehended one for the other Why should not magnitude produce an emotion different from both That it has this effect will be evident from a plain experiment of two bodies one great and one little which produce different emotions though they be precisely the same as to figure and colour There is indeed an obscurity in this matter occasioned by the following circumstance that the grandeur and beauty of the  same object mix so intimately as scarce to be distinguished But the beauty of colour comes in happily to enable us to make the distinction For the emotion of colour unites with that of figure not less intimately than grandeur does with either Yet the emotion of colour is distinguishable from that of figure and so is grandeur attentively considered though when these three emotions are blended together they are scarce felt as different emotions  Next that grandeur is an emotion in every circumstance pleasant appears from the following considerations Magnitude or greatness abstracted from all other circumstances swells the heart and dilates the mind We feel this to be a pleasant effect and we feel no such effect in contracting the mind upon little objects This may be illustrated by considering grandeur in an enemy Beauty is an agreeable quality whether in a friend or enemy and when the emotion it raiseth is mixed with resentment against an enemy it must have the effect to moderate our resentment In the same manner grandeur in an enemy undoubtedly  foftens and blunts our resentment Grandeur indeed may indirectly and by reflection produce an unpleasant effect Grandeur in an enemy like courage may increase our fear when we consider the advantage he hath over us by this quality But the same indirect effect may be produced by many other agreeable qualities such as beauty or wisdom  The magnitude of an ugly object serves it is true to augment our horror or aversion But this proceeds not from magnitude separately considered It proceeds from the following circumstance that in a large object a great quantity of ugly parts are presented to view  The same chain of reasoning is so obviously applicable to sublimity that it would be losing time to show the application Grandeur therefore and sublimity shall hereafter be considered both of them as pleasant emotions  The pleasant emotion raised by large objects has not escaped the poets  He doth bestride the narrow world  Like a Colossus and we petty men  Walk under his huge legs  Julius Caesar act sc  Cleopatra  I dreamt there was an Emp'ror Antony  Oh such another sleep that I might see  But such another man  His face was as the heav'ns and therein stuck  A sun and moon which kept their course and lighted  The little O o' th' earth  His legs bestrid the ocean his rear'd arm  Crested the world  Antony and Cleopatra act sc  Majesty  Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw  What's near it with it It's a massy wheel  Fixt on the summit of the highest mount  To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things  Are mortis'd and adjoin'd which when it falls  Each small annexment petty consequence  Attends the boist'rous ruin  Hamlet act sc  The poets have also made good use of  the emotion produced by the elevated situation of an object  Quod si me lyricis vatibus inseres  Sublimi feriam sidera vertice  Horace Carm l ode  Oh thou the earthly author of my blood  Whose youthful spirit in me regenerate  Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up  To reach at victory above my head  Richard II act sc  Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal  The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne  Richard II act sc  Anthony  Why was I rais'd the meteor of the world  Hung in the skies and blazing as I travell'd  Till all my fires were spent and then cast downward  To be trod out by Caesar  Dryden All for love act  Though the quality of magnitude produceth a pleasant emotion we must not conclude that the opposite quality of littleness produceth a painful emotion It would be  unhappy for man were an object disagreeable from its being of a small size merely when he is surrounded with so many objects of that kind The same observation is applicable to elevation of place A body placed high is agreeable but the same body placed low is not by that circumstance rendered disagreeable Littleness and lowness of place are precisely similar in the following particular that they neither give pleasure nor pain And in this may visibly be discovered peculiar attention in fitting the internal constitution of man to his external circumstances Were littleness and lowness of place agreeable greatness and elevation could not be so Were littleness and lowness of place disagreeable they would occasion uninterrupted uneasiness  The difference betwixt great and little with respect to agreeableness is remarkably felt in a series when we pass gradually from the one extreme to the other A mental progress from the capital to the kingdom from that to Europeto the whole earthto the planetary systemto the universe is extremely pleasant the heart swells and  the mind is dilated at every step The returning in an opposite direction is not positively painful though our pleasure lessens at every step till it vanish into indifference Such a progress may sometimes produce a pleasure of a different sort which arises from taking a narrower and narrower inspection The same observation is applicable to a progress upward and downward Ascent is pleasant because it elevates us But descent is never painful it is for the most part pleasant from a different cause that it is according to the order of nature The fall of a stone from anyheight is extremely agreeable by its accelerated motion I feel it pleasant to descend from a mountain the descent is natural and easy Neither is looking downward painful On the contrary to look down upon objects makes part of the pleasure of elevation Looking down becomes then only painful when the object is so far below as to create dizziness and even when that is the case we feel a sort of pleasure mixt with the pain Witness Shakespear's description of Dover cliffs  How fearful  And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low  The crows and choughs that wing the midwayair  Shew scarce so gross as beetles Halfway down  Hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade  Methinks he seems no bigger than his head  The fishermen that walk upon the beach  Appear like mice and you tall anchoring bark  Diminish'd to her cock her cock a buoy  Almost too small for sight The murmuring surge  That on th' unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes  Cannot be heard so high I'll look no more  Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight  Topple down headlong  King Lear act sc  An observation is made above that the emotions of grandeur and sublimity are nearly allied Hence it is that the one term is frequently put for the other I give an example An increasing series of numbers produceth an emotion similar to that of mounting upward and for that reason is commonly termed  an ascending series  A series of numbers gradually decreasing produceth an emotion similar to that of going downward and for that reason is commonly  termed  a descending series  We talk familiarly of going up to the capital and of going down to the country From a lesser kingdom we talk of going up to a greater whence the  anabasis  in the Greek language when one travels from Greece to Persia We discover the same way of speaking in the language even of Japan  Kempser's history of Japan b ch  and its universality proves it the offspring of a natural feeling  The foregoing observation leads us naturally to consider grandeur and sublimity in a figurative sense and as applicable to the fine arts Hitherto I have considered these terms in their proper meaning as applicable to objects of sight only and I thought it of importance to bestow some pains upon that article because generally speaking the figurative sense of a word is derived from its proper sense which will be found to hold in the present subject Beauty in its original signification is confined to objects of sight But as many other objects intellectual as well as moral raise emotions resembling that  of beauty the resemblance of the effects prompts us naturally to extend the term  beauty  to these objects This equally accounts for the terms  grandeur  and  sublimity  taken in a figurative sense Every emotion from whatever cause proceeding that resembles an emotion of grandeur or elevation is called by the same name Thus generosity is said to be an elevated emotion as well as great courage and that firmness of soul which is superior to misfortunes obtains the peculiar name of  magnanimity  On the other hand every emotion that contracts the mind and fixeth it upon things trivial or of no importance is termed  low  by its resemblance to an emotion produced by a little or low object of sight Thus an appetite for trifling amusements is called  a low taste  The same terms are applied to characters and actions We talk familiarly of an elevated genius of a great man and equally so of littleness of mind Some actions are great and elevated others are low and groveling Sentiments and even expressions are characterised in the same manner An expression or sentiment that raises  the mind is denominated  great  or  elevated  and hence the sublime  Longinus gives a pretty good description of the sublime though not entirely just in every one of the circumstances  "That the mind is elevated by it and so sensibly affected as to swell in transport and inward pride as if what is only heard or read were its own invention"  But he adheres not to this description In his th chapter he justly observes that many passions have nothing of the grand such as grief fear pity which depress the mind instead of raising it And yet in chapter th he mentions Sappho's ode upon love as sublime Beautiful it is undoubtedly but it cannot be sublime because it really depresses the mind instead of raising it His translator Boileau is not more successful in his instances In his th reflection he cites a passage from Demosthenes and another from Herodotus as sublime which are not so  in poetry In such figurative terms the distinction is lost that is made betwixt  great  and  elevated  in their proper sense for the resemblance is not so entire as to preserve these terms distinct in their figurative application We carry this figure still farther Elevation in its proper sense includes superiority of place and lowness inferiority of place Hence a man of superior talents of superior rank of inferior parts of inferior taste and such like The veneration we have for our ancestors and for the ancients in general being similar  to the emotion produced by an elevated object of sight justifies the figurative expression of the ancients being raised above us or possessing a superior place And we may remark by the way that as words are intimately connected with ideas many by this form of expression are led to conceive their ancestors as really above them in place and their posterity below them  A grandam's name is little less in love  Than is the doting title of a mother  They are as children but one step below  Richard III act sc  The notes of the gamut proceeding regularly from the blunter or grosser sounds to those which are more acute and piercing produce in the hearer a feeling somewhat similar to what is produced by mounting upward and this gives occasion to the figurative expressions  a high note    a low note  Such is the resemblance in feeling betwixt real and figurative grandeur that among the nations on the east coast of Afric who are directed purely by nature the  different dignities of the officers of state are marked by the length of the batoon each carries in his hand And in Japan princes and great lords shew their rank by the length and size of their sedanpoles  Kempfer's history of Japan  Again it is a rule in painting that figures of a small size are proper for grotesque pieces but that in an historical subject which is grand and important the figures ought to be as great as the life The resemblance of these feelings is in reality so strong that elevation in a figurative sense is observed to have the same effect even externally that real elevation has  K Henry  This day is call'd the feast of Crispian  He that outlives this day and comes safe home  Will stand a tiptoe when this day is nam'd  And rouse him at the name of Crispian  Henry V act sc  The resemblance in feeling betwixt real and figurative grandeur is humorously illustrated by Addison in criticising upon the English tragedy  "The ordinary method  of making an hero is to clap a huge plume of feathers upon his head which rises so high that there is often a greater length from his chin to the top of his head than to the sole of his foot One would believe that we thought a great man and a tall man the same thing As these superfluous ornaments upon the head make a great man a princess generally receives her grandeur from those additional incumbrances that fall into her tail I mean the broad sweeping train that follows her in all her motions and finds constant employment for a boy who stands behind her to open and spread it to advantage  Spectator N  o    "  The Scythians impressed with the same of Alexander were astonished when they found him a little man  A gradual progress from small to great is not less remarkable in figurative than in real grandeur or elevation Every one must have observed the delightful effect of a number of thoughts or sentiments artfully  disposed like an ascending series and making impressions stronger and stronger Such disposition of members in a period is distinguished by a proper name being termed a  climax  In order to have a just conception of grandeur and sublimity it is necessary to be observed that within certain limits they produce their strongest effects which lessen by excess as well as by defect This is remarkable in grandeur and sublimity taken in their proper sense The strongest emotion of grandeur is raised by an object that can be taken in at one view An object so immense as not to be comprehended but in parts tends rather to distract than satisfy the mind  It is justly observed by Addison that perhaps a man would have been more astonished with the majestic air that appeared in one of Lysippus's statues of Alexander though no bigger than the life than he might have been with Mount Athos had it been cut into the figure of the hero according to the proposal of Phidias with a river in one hand and a city in the other  Spectator  N  o    In like manner the strongest emotion produced by elevation is where the object is seen distinctly A greater elevation lessens in appearance the  object till it vanish out of sight with its pleasant emotion The same is equally remarkable in figurative grandeur and elevation which shall be handled together because as observed above they are scarce distinguishable Sentiments may be so strained as to become obscure or to exceed the capacity of the human mind Against such licence of imagination every good writer will be upon his guard And therefore it is of greater importance to observe that even the true sublime may be carried beyond that pitch which produces the highest entertainment We are undoubtedly susceptible of a greater elevation than can be inspired by human actions the most heroic and magnanimous witness what we feel from Milton's description of superior beings Yet every man must be sensible of a more constant and pleasant elevation when the history of his own species is the subject He enjoys an elevation equal to that of the greatest hero of an Alexander or a Caesar of a Brutus or an Epaminondas He accompanies these heroes in their sublimest sentiments and most hazardous exploits  with a magnanimity equal to theirs and finds it no stretch to preserve the same tone of mind for hours together without sinking The case is by no means the same in describing the actions or qualities of superior beings The reader's imagination cannot keep pace with that of the poet and the mind unable to support itself in a strained elevation falls as from a height and the fall is immoderate like the elevation Where this effect is not felt it must be prevented by some obscurity in the conception which frequently attends the description of unknown objects  On the other hand objects of sight that are not remarkably great or high scarce raise any emotion of grandeur or sublimity and the same holds in other objects The mind is often roused and animated without being carried to the height of grandeur or sublimity This difference may be discerned in many sorts of music as well as in some musical instruments A kettledrum rouses and a hautboy is animating but neither of them inspire an emotion of sublimity Revenge animates the mind in a considerable  degree but I think it never produceth an emotion that can be termed  grand  or  sublime  and I shall have occasion afterward to observe that no disagreeable passion ever has this effect I am willing to put this to the test by placing before my reader the most spirited picture of revenge ever drawn It is a speech of Antony wailing over the body of Caesar  Wo to the hand that shed this costly blood  Over thy wounds now do I prophesy  Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips  To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue  A curse shall light upon the kind of men  Domestic fury and fierce civil strife  Shall cumber all the parts of Italy  Blood and destruction shall be so in use  And dreadful objects so familiar  That mothers shall but smile when they behold  Their infants quarter'd by the hands of war  All pity choak'd with custom of fell deeds  And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge  With  Atè  by his side come hot from hell  Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice  Cry  Havock  and let slip the dogs of war  Julius Caesar act sc  When the sublime is carried to its due height and circumscribed within proper bounds it inchants the mind and raises the most delightful of all emotions The reader ingrossed by a sublime object feels himself raised as it were to a higher rank When such is the case it is not wonderful that the history of conquerors and heroes should be universally the favourite entertainment And this fairly accounts for what I once erroneously suspected to be a wrong bias originally in human nature The grossest acts of oppression and injustice scarce blemish the character of a great conqueror We notwithstanding warmly espouse his interest accompany him in his exploits and are anxious for his success The splendor and enthusiasm of the hero transfused into the readers elevate their minds far above the rules of justice and render them in a great measure insensible of the wrong that is done  For in those days might only shall be admir'd  And valour and heroic virtue call'd  To overcome in battle and subdue  Nations and bring home spoils with infinite  Manslaughter shall be held the highest pitch  Of human glory and for glory done  Of triumph to be styl'd great conquerors  Patrons of mankind gods and sons of gods  Destroyers rightlier called and plagues of men  Thus fame shall be atchiev'd renown on earth  And what most merits fame in silence hid  Milton b  The attachment we have to things grand or lofty may be thought to proceed from an unwearied inclination we have to be exalted No desire is more universal than to be respected and honoured Upon that account chiefly are we ambitious of power riches titles fame which would suddenly lose their relish did they not raise us above others and command submission and deference  Honestum per se esse expetendum indicant pueri in quibus ut in speculis natura cernitur Quanta studia decertantium sunt Quanta ipsa certamina Ut illi efferuntur laetitia cum vicerunt Ut pudet victos Ut se accusari nolunt Ut cupiunt laudari Quos illi labores non perferunt ut aequalium principes sint  Cicero de finibus  But the preference given to things grand and sublime must have a deeper root in human nature Many bestow their time  upon low and trifling amusements without showing any desire to be exalted Yet these very persons talk the same language with the rest of mankind and at least in their judgement if not in their taste prefer the more elevated pleasures They acknowledge a more refined taste and are ashamed of their own as low and groveling This sentiment constant and universal must be the work of nature and it plainly indicates an original attachment in human nature to every object that elevates the mind Some men may have a greater relish for an object not of the highest rank but they are conscious of the common nature of man and that it ought not to be subjected to their peculiar taste  The irregular influence of grandeur reaches also to other matters However good honest or useful a man may be he is not so much respected as one of a more elevated character is though of less integrity nor do the misfortunes of the former affect us so much as those of the latter I add because it cannot be disguised that the remorse which attends breach  of engagement is in a great measure proportioned to the figure that the injured person makes The vows and protestations of lovers are an illustrious example of this observation for these commonly are little regarded when made to women of inferior rank  What I have said suggests a capital rule for reaching the sublime in such works of art as are susceptible of it and that is to put in view those parts or circumstances only which make the greatest figure keeping out of sight every thing that is low or trivial Such judicious selection of capital circumstances is by an eminent critic styled  grandeur of manner  Spectator N  o    The mind from an elevation inspired by important objects cannot without reluctance be forced down to bestow any share of its attention upon trifles In none of the fine arts is there so great scope for this rule as in poetry which by that means enjoys a remarkable power of bestowing upon objects and events an air of grandeur When we are spectators every  minute object presents itself in its order But in describing at second hand these are laid aside and the capital objects are brought close together A judicious taste in selecting after this manner the most interesting incidents to give them an united force accounts for a fact which at first sight may appear surprising that we are more moved by a poetical narrative at second hand than when we are spectators of the event itself in all its circumstances  Longinus exemplifies the foregoing rule by a comparison of two passages  Chap of the Sublime  The first from Aristaeus is thus translated  Ye pow'rs what madness how on ships so frail  Tremendous thought can thoughtless mortals sail  For stormy seas they quit the pleasing plain  Plant woods in waves and dwell amidst the main  Far o'er the deep a trackless path they go  And wander oceans in pursuit of wo  No ease their hearts no rest their eyes can find  On heaven their looks and on the waves their mind  Sunk are their spirits while their arms they rear  And gods are wearied with their fruitless prayer  The other from Homer I shall give in Pope's translation  Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends  And swell'd with tempests on the ship descends  White are the decks with foam the winds aloud  Howl o'er the masts and sing through every shrowd  Pale trembling tir'd the sailors freeze with fears  And instant death on every wave appears  In the latter passage the most striking circumstances are selected to fill the mind with the grand and terrible The former is a collection of minute and low circumstances which scatter the thought and make no impression The passage at the same time is full of verbal antitheses and low conceit extremely improper in a scene of distress But this last observation is made occasionally only as it belongs not to the present subject  The following passage from the twentyfirst book of the Odyssey deviates widely  from the rule above laid down It concerns that part of the history of Penelope and her suitors in which she is made to declare in favour of him who should prove the most dexterous in shooting with the bow of Ulysses  Now gently winding up the fair ascent  By many an easy step the matron went  Then o'er the pavement glides with grace divine  With polish'd oak the level pavements shine  The folding gates a dazling light display'd  With pomp of various architrave o'erlay'd  The bolt obedient to the silken string  Forsakes the staple as she pulls the ring  The wards respondent to the key turn round  The bars fall back the flying valves resound  Loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring  So roar'd the lock when it releas'd the spring  She moves majestic through the wealthy room  Where treasur'd garments cast a rich perfume  There from the column where aloft it hung  Reach'd in its splendid case the bow unstrung  Virgil sometimes errs against this rule In the following passages minute circumstances are brought into full view and what is still worse they are described in all  the sublimity of poetical description  Aeneid    L    l    to    L    l    to    L    l    to  And the last which is a description of a funeral is the less excuseable as it relates to a man who makes no figure in the poem  The speech of Clytemnestra descending from her chariot in the Iphigenia of Euripides beginning of act is stuffed with a number of low common and trivial circumstances  But of all writers Lucan in this article is the most injudicious The seafight betwixt the Romans and Massilians  Lib beginning at line  is described so much in detail without exhibiting any grand or general view that the reader is quite fatigued with endless circumstances and never feels any degree of elevation And yet there are some fine incidents those for example of the two brothers and of the old man and his son which separated from the rest would affect us greatly But Lucan once engaged in a description knows no bounds See other passages of the same  kind  L    l    to    L    l    to  The episode of the sorceress Erictho end of book is intolerably minute and prolix  To these I venture to oppose a passage from an old historical ballad  Go little page tell Hardiknute  That lives on hill so high  High  in the old Scotch language is pronounced  hee    To draw his sword the dread of faes  And haste to follow me  The little page flew swift as dart  Flung by his master's arm  Come down come down Lord Hardiknute  And rid your king from harm  This rule is also applicable to other fine arts In painting it is established that the principal figure must be put in the strongest light that the beauty of attitude consists in placing the nobler parts most in view and in suppressing the smaller parts as much as possible that the folds of the drapery must be few and large that foreshortenings are bad because they make the parts appear  little and that the muscles ought to be kept as entire as possible without being divided into small sections Every one at present is sensible of the importance of this rule when applied to gardening in opposition to the antiquated taste of parterres split into a thousand small parts in the strictest regularity of figure Those who have succeeded best in architecture have governed themselves by this rule in all their models  Another rule chiefly regards the sublime though it may be applied to every literary performance intended for amusement and that is to avoid as much as possible abstract and general terms Such terms perfectly well fitted for reasoning and for conveying instruction serve but imperfectly the ends of poetry They stand upon the same footing with mathematical signs contrived to express our thoughts in a concise manner But images which are the life of poetry cannot be raised in any perfection otherwise than by introducing particular objects General terms that comprehend a number of individuals must be excepted from this rule Our kindred our clan our country  and words of the like import though they scarce raise any image have notwithstanding a wonderful power over our passions The greatness of the complex object overbalances the obscurity of the image  What I have further to say upon this subject shall be comprehended in a few observations A man is capable of being raised so much above his ordinary pitch by an emotion of grandeur that it is extremely difficult by a single thought or expression to produce that emotion in perfection The rise must be gradual and the result of reiterated impressions The effect of a single expression can be but momentary and if one feel suddenly somewhat like a swelling or exaltation of mind the emotion vanisheth as soon as felt Single expressions I know are often justly cited as examples of the sublime But then their effect is nothing compared with a grand subject displayed in its capital parts I shall give a few examples that the reader may judge for himself In the famous action of Thermopylae where Leonidas the Spartan King with his chosen band fighting for their  country were cut off to the last man a saying is reported of Dieneces one of the band which expressing chearful and undisturbed bravery is well intitled to the first place in examples of this kind Talking of the number of their enemies it was observed that the arrows shot by such a multitude would intercept the light of the sun So much the better says he for we shall then fight in the shade  Herodotus book    Somerset  Ah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are  We might recover all our loss again  The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power  Ev'n now we heard the news Ah couldst thou fly  Warwick  Why then I would not fly  Third part Henry VI act sc  Such a sentiment from a man expiring of his wounds is truly heroic and must elevate the mind to the greatest height that can be done by a single expression It will not  suffer in a comparison with the famous sentiment  Qu'il mourut  in Corneille's Horace The latter is a sentiment of indignation merely the former of invincible fortitude  In opposition to these examples to cite many a sublime passage enriched with the finest images and dressed in the most nervous expressions would scarce be fair I shall produce but one instance from Shakespear which sets a few objects before the eye without much pomp of language It works its effect by representing these objects in a climax raising the mind higher and higher till it feel the emotion of grandeur in perfection  The cloudcapt tow'rs the gorgeous palaces  The solemn temples the great globe itself  Yea all which it inherit shall dissolve  c  The cloudcapt tow'rs  produce an elevating emotion heightened by the  gorgeous palaces  And the mind is carried still higher and higher by the images that follow Successive images making thus stronger and stronger impressions must elevate more than any single image can do  I proceed to another observation In the chapter of beauty it is remarked that regularity is required in small figures and order in small groups but that in advancing gradually from small to great regularity and order are less and less required This remark serves to explain the extreme delight we have in viewing the face of nature when sufficiently enriched and diversified by objects The bulk of the objects seen in a natural landscape are beautiful and some of them grand A flowing river a spreading oak a round hill an extended plain are delightful and even a rugged rock or barren heath though in themselves disagreeable contribute by contrast to the beauty of the whole Joining to these the verdure of the fields the mixture of light and shade and the sublime canopy spread over all it will not appear wonderful that so extensive a group of glorious objects should swell the heart to its utmost bounds and raise the strongest emotion of grandeur The spectator is conscious of an enthusiasm which cannot bear confinement nor the strictness of regularity and order He loves  to range at large and is so inchanted with shining objects as to neglect slight beauties or defects Thus it is that the delightful emotion of grandeur depends little on order and regularity And when the emotion is at its height by a survey of the greatest objects order and regularity are almost totally disregarded  The same observation is applicable in some measure to works of art In a small building the slightest irregularity is disagreeable In a magnificent palace or a large Gothic church irregularities are less regarded In an epic poem we pardon many negligences which would be intolerable in a sonnet or epigram Notwithstanding such exceptions it may be justly laid down for a rule That in all works of art order and regularity ought to be governing principles And hence the observation of Longinus  Chap    "In works of art we have regard to exact proportion in those of nature to grandeur and magnificence"  I shall add but one other observation  That no means can be more successfully employed to sink and depress the mind than grandeur or sublimity By the artful introduction of an humbling object the fall is great in proportion to the former elevation Of this doctrine Shakespear affords us a beautiful illustration in a passage part of which is cited above for another purpose  The cloudcapt tow'rs the gorgeous palaces  The solemn temples the great globe itself  Yea all which it inherit shall dissolve  And like the baseless fabric of a vision  Leave not a rack behind  Tempest act sc  The elevation of the mind in the former part of this beautiful passage makes the fall great in proportion when the most humbling of all images is introduced that of an utter dissolution of the earth and its inhabitants A sentiment makes not the same impression in a cool state that it does when the mind is warmed and a depressing or melancholy sentiment makes the strongest impression when it brings down the mind from its highest state of elevation or chearfulness  This indirect effect of elevation to sink the mind is sometimes produced without the intervention of any humbling image There was occasion above to remark that in describing superior beings the reader's imagination unable to support itself in a strained elevation falls often as from a height and sinks even below its ordinary tone The following instance comes luckily in view for a better illustration cannot be given  "God said Let there be light and there was light"  Longinus cites this passage from Moses as a shining example of the sublime and it is scarce possible in fewer words to convey so clear an image of the infinite power of the Deity But then it belongs to the present subject to remark that the emotion of sublimity raised by this image is but momentary and that the mind unable to support itself in an elevation so much above nature immediately sinks down into humility and veneration for a being so far exalted above us groveling mortals Every one is acquainted with a dispute about this passage betwixt  two French critics  Boileau and Huet  the one positively affirming the other as positively denying it to be sublime What I have opened shows that both of them have reached the truth but neither of them the whole truth Every one of taste must be sensible that the primary effect of this passage is an emotion of grandeur This so far justifies Boileau But then every one of taste must be equally sensible that the emotion is merely a flash which vanisheth instantly and gives way to the deepest humility and veneration This indirect effect of sublimity justifies Huet on the other hand who being a man of true piety and perhaps of inferior imagination felt the humbling passions more sensibly than his antagonist And even laying aside any peculiarity of character Huet's opinion may I think be defended as the more solid upon the following account that in such images the depressing emotions are the more sensibly felt and have the longer endurance  The straining an elevated subject beyond  due bounds and beyond the reach of an ordinary conception is not a vice so frequent as to require the correction of criticism But false sublime is a rock which writers of more fire than judgement generally split on And therefore a collection of examples may be of use as a beacon to future adventurers One species of false sublime known by the name of  bombast  is common among writers of a mean genius It is a serious endeavour by strained description to raise a low or familiar subject above its rank which instead of being sublime never fails to be ridiculous I am extremely sensible how prone the mind is in some animating passions to magnify its objects beyond natural bounds But such hyperbolical description has its limits If carried beyond the impulse of the propensity the colouring no longer pleases it degenerates into the burlesque Take the following examples  Sejanus  Great and high  The world knows only two that's Rome and I  My roof receives me not 'tis air I tread  And at each step I feel my advanc'd head  Knock out a star in heav'n  Sejanus Ben Johnson act  A writer who has no natural elevation of genius is extremely apt to deviate into bombast He strains above his genius and the violent effort he makes carries him generally beyond the bounds of propriety Boileau expresses this happily  L'autre à peur de ramper il se perd dans la nue  L'art poet chant l    The same author Ben Johnson abounds in the bombast  The mother  Th'expulsed Apicata finds them there  Whom when she saw lie spread on the degrees  After a world of fury on herself  Tearing her hair defacing of her face  Beating her breasts and womb kneeling amaz'd  Crying to heav'n then to them at last  Her drowned voice got up above her woes  And with such black and bitter exercrations  As might affright the gods and force the sun  Run backward to the east nay make the old  Deformed Chaos rise again t' o'erwhelm  Them us and all the world she fills the air  Upbraids the heavens with their partial dooms  Defies their tyrannous powers and demands  What she and those poor innocents have transgress'd  That they must suffer such a share in vengeance  Sejanus act sc last  Lentulus the man  If all our fire were out

 Till the flood rise upon the guilty world  And make the ruin common  Lady Jane Gray act near the end  Another species of false sublime is still more faulty than bombast and that is to force an elevation by introducing imaginary beings without preserving any propriety in their actions as if it were lawful to ascribe every extravagance and inconsistence to beings of the poet's creation No writers are more licentious in this article than Johnson and Dryden  Methinks I see Death and the furies waiting  What we will do and all the heaven at leisure  For the great spectacle Draw then your

an author in his closet A certain manner of acting which is grand when supported by dignity in the sentiment and force in the expression is ridiculous where the sentiment is mean and the expression flat  CHAP V Motion and Force  THAT motion is agreeable to the eye without relation to purpose or design may appear from the amusement it gives to infants Juvenile exercises are relished chiefly upon that account  If to see a body in motion be agreeable one will be apt to conclude that to see it at rest is disagreeable But we learn from experience that this would be a rash conclusion Rest is one of those circumstances that are neither agreeable nor disagreeable It is viewed with perfect indifferency And happy it is for mankind that the matter is so ordered If rest were agreeable it would disincline us to motion by which all things are performed If it were disagreeable it would be a source of perpetual uneasiness for the bulk of the things we see appear to be at  rest A similar instance of designing wisdom I have had occasion to explain in opposing grandeur to littleness and elevation to lowness of place  See chap  Even in the simplest matters the finger of God is conspicuous The happy adjustment of the internal nature of man to his external circumstances displayed in the instances here given is indeed admirable  Motion is certainly agreeable in all its varieties of quickness and slowness But motion long continued admits some exceptions That degree of continued motion which corresponds to the natural course of our perceptions is the most agreeable  See chap  The quickest motion is for an instant delightful But it soon appears to be too rapid It becomes painful by forcibly accelerating the course of our perceptions Slow continued motion becomes disagreeable for an opposite reason that it retards the natural course of our perceptions  There are other varieties in motion beside  quickness and slowness that make it more or less agreeable Regular motion is preferred before what is irregular witness the motion of the planets in orbits nearly circular The motion of the comets in orbits less regular is less agreeable  Motion uniformly accelerated resembling an ascending series of numbers is more agreeable than when uniformly retarded Motion upward is agreeable by the elevation of the moving body What then shall we say of downward motion regularly accelerated by the force of gravity compared with upward motion regularly retarded by the same force Which of these is the most agreeable This question is not easily solved  Motion in a straight line is no doubt agreeable But we prefer undulating motion as of waves of a flame of a ship under sail Such motion is more free and also more natural Hence the beauty of a serpentine river  The easy and sliding motion of fluids from the lubricity and incoherence of their parts is agreeable upon that account But  the agreeableness chiefly depends upon the following circumstance that the motion is perceived not as of one body but as of an endless number moving together with order and regularity Poets struck with this beauty draw more images from fluids than from solids  Force is of two kinds one quiescent and one exerted by motion The former dead weight for example must be laid aside for a body at rest is not by that circumstance either agreeable or disagreeable Moving force only belongs to the present subject and though it is not separable from motion yet by the power of abstraction either of them may be considered independent of the other Both of them are agreeable because both of them include activity It is agreeable to see a thing move to see it moved as when it is dragged or pushed along is neither agreeable nor disagreeable more than when at rest It is agreeable to see a thing exert force but it makes not the thing either agreeable or disagreeable to see force exerted upon it  Though motion and force are each of  them agreeable the impressions they make are different This difference clearly felt is not easily described All we can say is that the emotion raised by a moving body resembles its cause it feels as if the mind were carried along The emotion raised by force exerted resembles also its cause it feels as if force were exerted within the mind  To illustrate this difference I give the following examples It has been explained why smoke ascending in a calm day suppose from a cottage in a wood is an agreeable object  Chap  Landscapepainters are fond of this object and introduce it upon all occasions As the ascent is natural and without effort it is delightful in a calm state of mind It makes an impression of the same sort with that of a gentlyflowing river but more agreeable because ascent is more to our taste than descent A firework or a  jet d'eau  rouses the mind more because the beauty of force visibly exerted is superadded to that of upward motion  To a man reclining indolently upon a bank of flowers ascending smoke in a still morning is delightful But a firework or a  jet d'eau  rouses him from this supine posture and puts him in motion  A  jet d'eau  makes an impression distinguishable from that of a waterfall Downward motion being natural and without effort tends rather to quiet the mind than to rouse it Upward motion on the contrary overcoming the resistance of gravity makes an impression of a great effort and thereby rouses and enlivens the mind  The public games of the Greeks and Romans which gave so much entertainment to the spectators consisted chiefly in exerting force wrestling leaping throwing great stones and such like trials of strength When great force is exerted the effort felt within the mind produces great life and vivacity The effort may be such as in some measure to overpower the mind Thus the explosion of gunpowder the violence of a torrent the weight of a mountain and the crush of an earthquake create astonishment rather than pleasure  No quality nor circumstance contributes more to grandeur than force especially as exerted by sensible beings I cannot make this more evident than by the following citations  Him the almighty power  Hurl'd headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky  With hideous ruin and combustion down  To bottomless perdition there to dwell  In adamantine chains and penal fire  Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms  Paradise Lost book  Now storming fury rose  And clamour such as heard in heaven till now  Was never arms on armour clashing bray'd  Horrible discord and the madding wheels  Of brazen chariots rag'd dire was the noise  Of conflict over head the dismal hiss  Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew  And flying vaulted either host with fire  So under fiery cope together rush'd  Both battles main with ruinous

by small if Nature's concord broke  Among the constellations war were sprung  Two planets rushing from aspéct malign  Of fiercest opposition in mid sky  Should combat and their jarring spheres confound  Ibid book  We shall now consider the effect of motion and force in conjunction In contemplating the planetary system what strikes us the most is the spherical figures of the planets and their regular motions The conception we have of their activity  and enormous bulk is more obscure The beauty accordingly of this system raises a more lively emotion than its grandeur But if we could imagine ourselves spectators comprehending the whole system at one view the activity and irresistible force of these immense bodies would fill us with amazement Nature cannot furnish another scene so grand  Motion and force agreeable in themselves are also agreeable by their utility when employed as means to accomplish some beneficial end Hence the superior beauty of some machines where force and motion concur to perform the work of numberless hands Hence the beautiful motions firm and regular of a horse trained for war Every single step is the fittest that can be for obtaining the end proposed But the grace of motion is visible chiefly in man not only for the reasons mentioned but also because every gesture is significant The power however of agreeable motion is not a common talent Every limb of the human body has a good and a bad an agreeable and disagreeable action Some motions  are extremely graceful others are plain and vulgar some express dignity others meanness But the pleasure here arising not singly from the beauty of motion but from indicating character and sentiment belongs to a different chapter  Chap    I should conclude with the final cause of the relish we have for motion and force were it not so evident as to require no explanation We are placed here in such circumstances as to make industry essential to our wellbeing for without industry the plainest necessaries of life are not to be obtained When our situation therefore in this world requires activity and a constant exertion of motion and force Providence indulgently provides for our welfare in making these agreeable to us It would be a blunder in our nature to make things disagreeable that we depend on for existence and even to make them indifferent would tend to make us relax greatly from that degree of activity which is indispensable  CHAP VI Novelty and the unexpected appearance of objects  OF all the particulars that contribute to raise emotions not excepting beauty or even greatness novelty hath the most powerful influence A new spectacle attracts multitudes It produceth instantaneously an emotion which totally occupies the mind and for a time excludes all other objects The soul seems to meet the strange appearance with a certain elongation of itself and all is hushed in close contemplation In some instances there is perceived a degree of agony attended with external symptoms extremely expressive Conversation among the vulgar never is more interesting than when it runs upon strange objects and extraordinary events Men tear themselves from their native country in search of things rare and new and  curiosity converts into a pleasure the fatigues and even perils of travelling To what cause shall we ascribe these singular appearances The plain account of the matter follows Curiosity is implanted in human nature for a purpose extremely beneficial that of acquiring knowledge New and strange objects above all others excite our curiosity and its gratification is the emotion above described known by the name of  wonder  This emotion is distinguished from  admiration  Novelty whereever found whether in a quality or action is the cause of wonder admiration is directed upon the operator who performs any thing wonderful  During infancy every new object is probably the occasion of wonder in some degree because during infancy every object at first is strange as well as new But as objects are rendered familiar by custom we cease by degrees to wonder at new appearances that have any resemblance to what we are acquainted with A thing must be singular as well as new to excite our curiosity and to raise our wonder To save multiplying words I would be understood to  comprehend both circumstances when I hereafter talk of novelty  In an ordinary train of perceptions where one thing introduces another not a single object makes its appearance unexpectedly  See chap  The mind thus prepared for the reception of its objects admits them one after another without perturbation But when a thing breaks in unexpectedly and without the preparation of any connection it raises a singular emotion known by the name of  surprise  This emotion may be produced by the most familiar object as when one accidentally meets a friend who was reported to be dead or a man in high life lately a beggar On the other hand a new object however strange will not produce this emotion if the spectator be prepared for the sight An elephant in India will not surprise a traveller who goes to see one and yet its novelty will raise his wonder An Indian in Britain would be much surprised to stumble upon an elephant feeding at large in the open fields but the creature  itself to which he was accustomed would not raise his wonder  Surprise thus in several respects differs from wonder Unexpectedness is the cause of the former emotion novelty is the cause of the latter Nor differ they less in their nature and circumstances as will be explained by and by With relation to one circumstance they perfectly agree which is the shortness of their duration The instantaneous production of these emotions in perfection may contribute to this effect in conformity to a general law That things soon decay which soon come to perfection The violence of the emotions may also contribute for an ardent emotion which is not susceptible of increase cannot have a long course But their short duration is occasioned chiefly by that of their causes We are soon reconciled to an object however unexpected and novelty soon degenerates into familiarity  Whether these emotions be pleasant or painful is not a clear point It may appear strange that our own feelings and their capital qualities should afford any matter for a  doubt But when we are ingrossed by any emotion there is no place for speculation and when sufficiently calm for speculation it is not easy to recal the emotion with sufficient accuracy New objects are sometimes terrible sometimes delightful The terror which a tyger inspires is greatest at first and wears off gradually by familiarity On the other hand even women will acknowledge that it is novelty which pleases the most in a new fashion At this rate it should be thought that wonder is not in itself pleasant or painful but that it assumes either quality according to circumstances This doctrine however plausible must not pass without examination And when we reflect upon the principle of curiosity and its operations a glimpse of light gives some faint view of a different theory Our curiosity is never more thoroughly gratified than by new and singular objects That very gratification is the emotion of wonder which therefore according to the analogy of nature ought always to be pleasant  See chap part sect    And indeed it would be a great defect in human nature were the gratification of so useful a principle unpleasant But upon a more strict scrutiny we shall not have occasion to mark curiosity as an exception from the general rule A new object it is true that hath a threatening appearance adds to our terror by its novelty But from this experiment it doth not follow that novelty is in itself disagreeable It is perfectly consistent that we should be delighted with an object in one view and terrified with it in another A river in flood swelling over its banks is a grand and delightful object and yet it may produce no small degree of fear when we attempt to cross it Courage and magnanimity are agreeable and yet when we view these qualities in an enemy they serve to increase our terror  See chap  In the same manner novelty has two effects clearly distinguishable from each other A new object by gratifying curiosity must always be agreeable It may at the same time have an opposite effect indirectly which is to inspire  terror For when a new object appears in any degree dangerous our ignorance of its powers and qualities affords ample scope for the imagination to dress it in the most frightful colours  Essays on the principles of morality and natural religion part ess  Thus the first sight of a lion at some distance may at the same instant produce two opposite feelings the pleasant emotion of wonder and the painful passion of terror The novelty of the object produces the former directly and contributes to the latter indirectly Thus when the subject is analized we find that the power which novelty hath indirectly to inflame terror is perfectly consistent with its being in every case agreeable The matter may be put in a still clearer light by varying the scene If a lion be first seen from a place of safety the spectacle is altogether agreeable without the least mixture of terror If again the first sight put us within reach of this dangerous animal our terror may be so great as quite to exclude any sense of novelty But this fact proves not  that wonder is painful it proves only that wonder may be excluded by a more powerful passion And yet it is this fact which in superficial thinking has thrown the subject into obscurity I presume we may now boldly affirm that wonder is in every case a pleasant emotion This is acknowledged as to all new objects that appear inoffensive And even as to objects that appear offensive I urge that the same must hold so long as the spectator can attend to the novelty  Whether surprise be in itself pleasant or painful is a question not less intricate than the former It is certain that surprise inflames our joy when unexpectedly we meet with an old friend and not less our terror when we stumble upon any thing noxious To clear this point we must trace it step by step And the first thing to be remarked is that in some instances an unexpected object overpowers the mind so as to produce a momentary stupefaction An unexpected object not less than one that is new is apt to sound an alarm and to raise terror Man naturally a defenceless being is happily so constituted as to apprehend danger in all  doubtful cases Accordingly where the object is dangerous or appears so the sudden alarm it gives without preparation is apt totally to unhinge the mind and for a moment to suspend all the faculties even thought itself  Hence the Latin names for surprise  torpor    animi stupor  In this state a man is quite helpless and if he move at all is as likely to run upon the danger as from it Surprise carried to this height cannot be either pleasant or painful because the mind during such momentary stupefaction is in a good measure if not totally insensible  If we then inquire for the character of this emotion it must be where the unexpected object or event produceth less violent effects And while the mind remains sensible of pleasure and pain is it not natural to suppose that surprise like wonder should have an invariable character I am inclined however to think that surprise has no invariable character but assumes that of the object which raises it Wonder is the gratification of a natural principle and upon  that account must be pleasant There novelty is the capital circumstance which for a time is intitled to possess the mind entirely in one unvaried tone The unexpected appearance of an object seems not equally intitled to produce an emotion distinguishable from the emotion pleasant or painful that is produced by the object in its ordinary appearance It ought not naturally to have any effect other than to swell that emotion by making it more pleasant or more painful than it commonly is And this conjecture is confirmed by experience as well as by language which is built upon experience When a man meets a friend unexpectedly he is said to be agreeably surprised and when he meets an enemy unexpectedly he is said to be disagreeably surprised It appears then that the sole effect of surprise is to swell the emotion raised by the object And this effect can be clearly explained A tide of connected perceptions glides gently into the mind and produceth no perturbation An object on the other hand breaking in unexpectedly sounds an alarm rouses the mind out of its calm  state and directs its whole attention upon the object which if agreeable becomes doubly so Several circumstances concur to produce this effect On the one hand the agitation of the mind and its keen attention prepare it in the most effectual manner for receiving a deep impression On the other hand the object by its sudden and unforeseen appearance makes an impression not gradually as expected objects do but as at one stroke with its whole force The circumstances are precisely similar where the object is in itself disagreeable  The pleasure of novelty is easily distinguished from that of variety To produce the latter a plurality of objects is necessary The former arises from a circumstance found in a single object Again where objects whether coexistent or in succession are sufficiently diversified the pleasure of variety is complete though every single object of the train be familiar But the pleasure of novelty directly opposite to familiarity requires no diversification  There are different degrees of novelty and its effects are in proportion The lowest  degree is found in objects that are surveyed a second time after a long interval That in this case an object takes on some appearance of novelty is certain from experience A large building of many parts variously adorned or an extensive field embellished with trees lakes temples statues and other ornaments will appear new oftener than once The memory of an object so complex is soon lost of its parts at least or of their arrangement But experience teaches that even without any decay of remembrance absence alone will give an air of novelty to a once familiar object which is not surprising because familiarity wears off gradually by absence Thus a person with whom we have been intimate returning after a long interval appears like a new acquaintance Distance of place contributes to this appearance not less than distance of time A friend after a short absence in a remote country has the same air of novelty as if he had returned after a longer interval from a place nearer home The mind forms a connection betwixt him and the remote country and bestows upon him the singularity  of the objects he has seen When two things equally new and singular are presented the spectator balances betwixt them But when told that one of them is the product of a distant quarter of the world he no longer hesitates but clings to this as the more singular Hence the preference given to foreign luxuries and to foreign curiosities which appear rare in proportion to their original distance  The next degree of novelty mounting upward is found in objects of which we have some information at second hand For description though it contribute to familiarity cannot altogether remove the appearance of novelty when the object itself is presented The first sight of a lion occasions some wonder after a thorough acquaintance with the correctest pictures or statues of that animal  A new object that bears some distant resemblance to a known species is an instance of a third degree of novelty A strong resemblance among individuals of the same species prevents almost entirely the effect of novelty unless distance of  place or some other circumstance concur But where the resemblance is faint some degree of wonder is felt and the emotion rises in proportion to the faintness of the resemblance  The highest degree of wonder ariseth from unknown objects that have no analogy to any species we are acquainted with Shakespear in a simile introduces this species of novelty  As glorious to the sight  As is a winged messenger from heaven  Unto the white upturned wondring eye  Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him  When he bestrides the lazypacing clouds  And sails upon the bosom of the air  Romeo and Juliet  One example of this species of novelty deserves peculiar attention and that is when an object altogether new is seen by one person only and but for once These circumstances heighten remarkably the emotion The singularity of the condition of the spectator concurs with the singularity  of the object to inflame wonder to its highest pitch  In explaining the effects of novelty the place a being occupies in the scale of existence is a circumstance that must not be omitted Novelty in the individuals of a low class is perceived with indifference or with a very slight emotion Thus a pebble however singular in its appearance scarce moves our wonder The emotion rises with the rank of the object and other circumstances being equal is strongest in the highest order of existence A strange animal affects us more than a strange vegetable and were we admitted to view superior beings our wonder would rise proportionably and accompanying Nature in her amazing works be completed in the contemplation of the Deity  However natural the love of novelty may be it is a matter of experience that those who relish novelty the most are careful to conceal its influence This relish it is true prevails in children in idle people and in men of a weak mind And yet after all why should one be ashamed for indulging  a natural propensity A distinction will explain this difficulty No man is ashamed to own that he loves to contemplate new or strange objects He neither condemns himself nor is censured by others for this appetite But every man studies to conceal that he loves a thing or performs an action merely for its novelty The reason of the difference will set the matter in a clear light Curiosity is a natural principle directed upon new and singular objects in the contemplation of which its gratification consists without leading to any end other than knowledge The man therefore who prefers any thing merely because it is new hath not this principle for his justification nor indeed any good principle Vanity is at the bottom which easily prevails upon those who have no taste to prefer things odd rare or singular in order to distinguish themselves from others And in fact the appetite for novelty as above mentioned reigns chiefly among persons of a mean taste who are ignorant of refined and elegant pleasures  The gratification of curiosity as mentioned  above is distinguished by a proper name  viz wonder  an honour denied to the gratification of any other principle emotion or passion so far as I can recollect This singularity indicates some important final cause which I endeavour to unfold An acquaintance with the various things that may affect us and with their properties is essential to our wellbeing Nor will a slight or superficial acquaintance be sufficient It ought to be so deeply ingraved on the mind as to be ready for use upon every occasion Now in order to a deep impression it is wisely contrived that things should be introduced to our acquaintance with a certain pomp and solemnity productive of a vivid emotion When the impression is once fairly made the emotion of novelty being no longer necessary vanisheth almost instantaneously never to return unless where the impression happens to be obliterated by length of time or other means in which case the second introduction is nearly as solemn as the first  Designing wisdom is no where more legible than in this part of the human frame  If new objects did not affect us in a very peculiar manner their impressions would be so slight as scarce to be of any use in life On the other hand did objects continue to affect us as deeply as at first the mind would be totally ingrossed with them and have no room left either for action or reflection  The final cause of surprise is still more evident than of novelty Selflove makes us vigilantly attentive to selfpreservation But selflove which operates by means of reason and reflection and impells not the mind to any particular object or from it is a principle too cool for a sudden emergency An object breaking in unexpectedly affords no time for deliberation and in this case the agitation of surprise is artfully contrived to rouse selflove into action Surprise gives the alarm and if there be any appearance of danger our whole force is instantly summoned up to shun or to prevent it  CHAP VII Risible Objects  SUCH is the nature of man that his powers and faculties are soon blunted by exercise The returns of sleep suspending all activity are not alone sufficient to preserve him in vigor During his waking hours amusement by intervals is requisite to unbend his mind from serious occupation The imagination of all our faculties the most active and not always at rest even in sleep contributes more than any other cause to recruit the mind and restore its vigor by amusing us with gay and ludicrous images and when relaxation is necessary such amusement is much relished But there are other sources of amusement beside the imagination Many objects natural as well as artificial may be distinguished by the epithet of  risible  because they raise in us a peculiar emotion expressed  externally by  laughter  This is a pleasant emotion and being also mirthful it most successfully unbends the mind and recruits the spirits  Ludicrous  is a general term signifying as we may conjecture from its derivation what is playsome sportive or jocular  Ludicrous  therefore seems the genus of which  risible  is a species limited as above to what makes us laugh  However easy it may be concerning any particular object to say whether it be risible or not it seems difficult if at all practicable to establish beforehand any general character by which objects of this kind may be distinguished from others Nor is this a singular case Upon a review we find the same difficulty in most of the articles already handled There is nothing more easy viewing a particular object than to pronounce that it is beautiful or ugly grand or little but were we to attempt general rules for ranging objects under different classes according to these qualities we should find ourselves utterly at a loss There is a separate cause which increases the difficulty  of distinguishing risible objects by a general character All men are not equally affected by risible objects and even the same person is more disposed to laugh at one time than another In high spirits a thing will make us laugh outright that will scarce provoke a smile when we are in a grave mood We must therefore abandon the thought of attempting general rules for distinguishing risible objects from others Risible objects however are circumscribed within certain limits which I shall suggest without pretending to any degree of accuracy And in the first place I observe that no object is risible but what appears slight little or trifling For man is so constituted as to be seriously affected with every thing that is of importance to his own interest or to that of others Secondly with respect to the works both of nature and of art nothing is risible but what deviates from the common nature of the subject it must be some particular out of rule some remarkable defect or excess a very long visage for example or a very short one Hence nothing just proper decent  beautiful proportioned or grand is risible A real distress raises pity and therefore cannot be risible But a slight or imaginary distress which moves not pity is risible The adventure of the fullingmills in Don Quixote is extremely risible so is the scene where Sancho in a dark night tumbles into a pit and attaches himself to the side by hand and foot there hanging in terrible dismay till the morning when he discovers himself to be within a foot of the bottom A nose remarkably long or short is risible but to want the nose altogether far from provoking laughter raises horror in the spectator  From what is said it will readily be conjectured that the emotion raised by a risible object is of a nature so singular as scarce to find place while the mind is occupied with any other passion or emotion And this conjecture is verified by experience We scarce ever find this emotion blended with any other One emotion I must except and that is contempt raised by some sort of improprieties Every improper act inspires us with some degree of contempt for the  author And if an improper act be at the same time risible and provoke laughter of which blunders and absurdities are noted instances the two emotions of contempt and of laughter unite intimately in the mind and produce externally what is termed  a laugh of derision  or  of scorn  Hence objects that cause laughter may be distinguished into two kinds They are either  risible  or  ridiculous  A risible object is mirthful only a ridiculous object is both mirthful and contemptible The first raises an emotion of laughter that is altogether pleasant the emotion of laughter raised by the other is qualified with that of contempt and the mixed emotion partly pleasant partly painful is termed  the emotion of ridicule  I avenge myself of the pain a ridiculous object gives me by a laugh of derision A risible object on the other hand gives me no pain it is altogether pleasant by a certain sort of titillation which is expressed externally by mirthful laughter Ridicule will be more fully explained afterward the present chapter is appropriated to the other emotion  Risible objects are so common and so well  understood that it is unnecessary to consume paper or time upon them Take the few following examples  Falstaff  I do remember him at Clement's inn like a man made after supper of a cheeseparing When he was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife  Second part Henry IV act sc  The foregoing is of disproportion The following examples are of slight or imaginary misfortunes  Falstaff  Go

lunatic knave would have search'd it but Fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand Well on went he for a search and away went I for foul cloaths But mark the sequel Master Brook I suffer'd the pangs of three egregious deaths first an intolerable fright to be detected by a jealous rotten bellweather next to be compass'd like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel

qualities and circumstances of single objects that seem peculiarly connected with criticism we proceed according to the method proposed in the chapter of beauty to the relations of objects beginning with the relations of resemblance and contrast  Man being unavoidably connected with the beings around him some acquaintance with their nature their powers and their qualities is requisite for regulating his conduct As an incentive to acquire a branch of knowledge so essential to our wellbeing motives alone of reason and interest are not sufficient Nature hath providently superadded curiosity a vigorous propensity which never is at rest It is this propensity which attaches us to every new object  See chap  and in  particular incites us to consider objects in the way of comparison in order to discover their differences and resemblances  Resemblance among objects of the same kind and dissimilitude among objects of different kinds are too obvious and familiar to gratify our curiosity in any degree The gratification lies in discovering differences among things where resemblance prevails and in discovering resemblances where difference prevails Thus a difference in individuals of the same kind of plants or animals is deemed a discovery while the many particulars in which they agree are neglected and in different kinds any resemblance is greedily remarked without attending to the many particulars in which they differ  A comparison however may be too far stretched When differences or resemblances are carried beyond certain bounds they appear slight and trivial and for that reason will not be relished by one of taste Yet such propensity is there to gratify passion curiosity in particular that even among good writers we find many comparisons too slight to afford satisfaction Hence the frequent  instances among logicians of distinctions without any solid difference and hence the frequent instances among poets and orators of similes without any just resemblance With regard to the latter I shall confine myself to one instance which will probably amuse the reader being a citation not from a poet nor orator but from a grave author writing an institute of law  "Our student shall observe that the knowledge of the law is like a deep well out of which each man draweth according to the strength of his understanding He that reacheth deepest seeth the amiable and admirable secrets of the law wherein I assure you the sages of the law in former times have had the deepest reach And as the bucket in the depth is easily drawn to the uppermost part of the water for  nullum elementum in suo proprio loco est grave  but take it from the water it cannot be drawn up but with a great difficulty so albeit beginnings of this study seem difficult yet when the professor of the law can dive into the depth it is delightful easy and without  any heavy burden so long as he keep himself in his own proper element  Coke upon Littleton p  "  Shakespear with much wit ridicules this disposition to similemaking by putting in the mouth of a weak man a resemblance much of a piece with that now mentioned  Fluellen  I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn I tell you Captain if you look in the maps of the orld I warrant that you sall find in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth that the situasions look you is both alike There is a river in Macedon there is also moreover a river in Monmouth it is call'd  Wye  at Monmouth but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river but it is all one 'tis as like as my fingers to my fingers and there is salmons in both If you mark Alexander's life well Harry of Monmouth's life is come after it indifferent well for there is figures in all things Alexander God knows and you know in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations and also being a little intoxicates in his prains did in his ales and his angers look you kill his pest friend Clytus  Gower  Our King is not like him in that he never kill'd any of his friends  Fluellen  It is not well done mark you now to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished I speak but in figures and comparisons of it As Alexander kill'd his friend Clytus being in his ales and his cups so also Harry Monmouth being in his right wits and his good judgments turn'd away the fat knight with the great bellydoublet he was full of jests and gypes and knaveries and mocks I have forgot his name  Gower  Sir John Falstaff  Fluellen  That is he I tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth  K Henry V act sc  Instruction no doubt is the chief end of comparison but not the only end In works addressed to the imagination comparison may be employed with great success to put a subject in a strong point of view A lively idea is formed of a man's courage by likening it to that of a lion and eloquence is exalted in our imagination by comparing it to a river overflowing its banks and involving all in its impetuous course The same effect is produced by contrast A man in prosperity becomes more sensible  of his happiness by opposing his condition to that of a person in want of bread Thus comparison is subservient to poetry as well as to philosophy and with respect to both the foregoing observation holds equally that resemblance among objects of the same kind and contrast among objects of different kinds have no effect Such a comparison neither tends to gratify our curiosity nor to set the objects compared in a stronger light Two apartments in a palace similar in shape size and furniture make separately as good a figure as when compared and the same observation applies to two similar copartments in a garden On the other hand oppose a regular building to a fall of water or a good picture to a towering hill or even a little dog to a large horse and the contrast will produce no effect But resemblance where the objects compared are of different kinds and contrast where the objects compared are of the same kind have each of them remarkably an enlivening effect The poets such of them as have a just taste draw all their similes from things that in the main  differ widely from the principal subject and they never attempt a contrast but where the things have a common genus and a resemblance in the capital circumstances Place together a large and a small sized animal of the same species the one will appear greater the other less than when viewed separately When we oppose beauty to deformity each makes a greater figure by the comparison  Upon a subject not only in itself curious but of great importance in all the fine arts I must be more particular That resemblance and contrast have an enlivening effect upon objects of sight is made sufficiently evident and that they have the same effect upon objects of the other senses will appear from induction Nor is this law confined to the external senses Characters contrasted make a greater figure by the opposition Iago in the tragedy of  Othello  says  He hath a daily beauty in his life  That makes me ugly  The character of a fop and of a rough warrior  are no where more successfully contrasted than by Shakespear  Hotspur  My liege I did deny no prisoners  But I remember when the fight was done  When I was dry with rage and extreme toil  Breathless and faint leaning

annihilate them in their own opinion Caesar beholding the statue of Alexander felt a great depression of spirits when he reflected that now at the age of thirtytwo when Alexander died he had not performed one memorable action  Our opinions also are much influenced by comparison A man whose opulence exceeds the ordinary standard is reputed richer than he is in reality and the character of wisdom or weakness if at all remarkable  is generally carried beyond the truth  The opinion a man forms of his present condition as to happiness or misery depends in a great measure on the comparison he makes betwixt it and his former condition  Could I forget  What I have been I might the better bear  What I am destin'd to I'm not the first  That have been wretched but to think how much  I have

timorous person upon the battlements of a high tower is seized with terror which even the consciousness of security cannot dissipate But upon one of a firm head this situation has a contrary effect The appearance of danger heightens by opposition the consciousness of security and of consequence the satisfaction that arises from security The feeling here resembles that above mentioned occasioned by a ship labouring in a storm  This effect of magnifying or lessening objects by means of comparison is so familiar that no philosopher has thought of searching for a cause  Practical writers upon the fine arts will attempt any thing being blind both to the difficulty and danger De Piles accounti g why contrast is agreeable says  "That it is a sort of war which puts the opposite parties in motion"  Thus to account for an effect of which there is no doubt any cause however foolish is made welcome  The obscurity of the subject may possibly have contributed to their silence But luckily in treating other subjects a principle is unfolded which will clearly account for this phenomenon It  depends upon the power of passion to model our opinion of objects for its gratification  Chap part  We have had occasion to see many illustrious examples of this singular power of passion and the present subject affords an additional instance That this is the cause will evidently appear by reflecting in what manner a spectator is affected when a very large animal is for the first time placed beside a very small one of the same species The opposition is the first thing that strikes the mind the unusual appearance gives surprise and the spectator prone to gratify this emotion conceives the opposition to be the greatest that can be He sees or seems to see the one animal extremely little and the other extremely large The emotion of surprise arising from any unusual resemblance serves equally to explain why at first view we are apt to think such resemblance more entire than it is in reality And it must be observed that the circumstances of more and less which are the proper subjects of comparison  raise a perception so indistinct and vague as to facilitate the effect described We have no mental standard of great and little nor of the several degrees of any attribute and the mind thus unrestrained is naturally disposed to indulge its surprise to the utmost extent  In exploring the operations of the mind some of which are extremely nice and slippery it is necessary to proceed with the utmost circumspection And after all seldom it happens that speculations of this kind afford any strong conviction Luckily in the present case we have at hand facts and experiments that support the foregoing theory in a satisfactory manner In the first place the opposing a small object of one species to a great object of another produces not in any degree that effect of contrast which is so remarkable when both objects are of the same species There is no difference betwixt these two cases that promiseth to have any influence but only that the former is common the latter rare May we not then fairly conclude that surprise from the rarity of appearance is the cause  of contrast when we find no such effect where the appearance is common In the next place if surprise be the sole cause of the effects that appear in making a comparison it follows necessarily that these effects will vanish so soon as a comparison becomes familiar This holds so unerringly as to leave no reasonable doubt that surprise is the prime mover in this operation Our surprise is great the first time a small lapdog is seen with a large mastiff but when two such animals are constantly together there is no surprise and it makes no difference whether they be viewed separately or in company We put no bounds to the riches of a man who has recently made his fortune The opposition betwixt his present and past situation or betwixt his present situation and that of others is carried to an extreme With regard to a family that for many generations hath enjoyed great wealth the same false reckoning is not made It is equally remarkable that a simile loses its effect by repetition A lover compared to a moth scorching itself at the flame of a candle is a sprightly simile which by frequent  use has lost all force Love cannot now be compared to fire without some degree of disgust It has been justly objected against Homer that the lion is too often introduced in his similes All the variety he is able to throw into them is not sufficient to keep alive the reader's surprise  To explain the influence of comparison upon the mind I have chosen the simplest case that of two animals of the same kind differing in size only seen for the first time To complete the theory other circumstances must be taken in And the next supposition I shall make is where both animals separately familiar to the spectator are brought together for the first time In this case the effect of magnifying and diminishing will be found remarkably greater than in that first mentioned And the reason will appear upon analyzing the operation The first thing we feel is surprise occasioned by the uncommon difference of two creatures of the same species We are next sensible that the one appears less the other larger than they did formerly This new circumstance is a second cause of surprise  and augments it so as to make us imagine a still greater opposition betwixt the animals than if we had formed no notion of them beforehand  I shall confine myself to one other supposition That the spectator was acquainted beforehand with one of the animals only the lapdog for example This new circumstance will vary the effect Instead of widening the natural difference by enlarging in appearance the one animal and diminishing the other in proportion the whole apparent alteration will rest upon the lapdog The surprise to find it less than judged to be formerly will draw the whole attention of the mind upon it and this surprise will be gratified by conceiving it to be of the most diminutive size possible The mastiff in the mean time is quite neglected I am able to illustrate this effect by a very familiar example Take a piece of paper or linen reckoned to be a good white and compare it with something of the same kind that is a pure white The judgement we formed of the first object is instantly varied and the surprise occasioned by finding it not so  white as was thought produceth a hasty conviction that it is much less white than it is in reality Withdrawing now the pure white and putting in its place a deep black the surprise occasioned by this new circumstance carries our thought to the other extreme and we now conceive the original object to be a pure white Thus experience forces us to acknowledge that our emotions have an influence even upon our eyesight This experiment leads to a general observation That whatever is found more strange or beautiful than was expected is judged to be more strange or beautiful than it is in reality Hence it is a common artifice to depreciate beforehand what we wish to make a figure in the eyes of others  The comparisons employed by poets and orators coincide with the lastmentioned supposition It is always a known object that is to be aggrandized or lessened The former is effectuated by likening it to some grand object or by contrasting it with one that has the opposite character To effectuate the latter the method must be reversed The object must be contrasted with  something superior to itself or likened to something inferior The whole effect is produced upon the principal subject which by this means is elevated above its rank or depressed below it  In accounting for the effect that any unusual resemblance or contrast has upon the mind I have hitherto assigned no other cause but surprise and to prevent confusion and obscurity I thought it proper to discuss that principle first But surprise is not the only cause of the effect described Another cause concurs which operates perhaps not less powerfully than surprise This cause is a principle in human nature that lies still in obscurity not having been evolved by any writer though its effects are extensive As it is not distinguished by a proper name the reader must be satisfied with the following description No man who studies himself or others but must be sensible of a tendency or propensity in the mind to complete every work that is begun and to carry things to their full perfection This principle has little opportunity to display itself upon natural operations which are seldom left imperfect  But in the operations of art it hath great scope and displays itself remarkably by making us persevere in our own work and by making us wish for the completion of what is done by another We feel a sensible pleasure when the work is brought to perfection and our pain is not less sensible when we are disappointed Hence our uneasiness when an interesting story is broke off in the middle when a piece of music ends without a close or when a building or garden is left imperfect The same principle operates in making collections such as the whole works good and bad of any author A certain person endeavoured to collect prints of all the capital paintings and succeeded except as to a few La Bruyere remarks that an anxious search was made for these not on account of their value but to complete the set  The examples above given are of subjects that can be brought to an end or conclusion But the same uneasiness is perceptible with respect to subjects that admit not any conclusion witness a series that has no end commonly called  an infinite series  The mind running along such a series begins soon to feel an uneasiness which becomes more and more sensible in continuing its progress  An unbounded prospect doth not long continue agreeable We soon feel a slight uneasiness which increases with the time we bestow upon the object In order to find the cause of this uneasiness we first take under consideration an avenue without a terminating object Can a prospect without any termination be compared to an infinite series There is one striking difference that with respect to the eye no prospect can be unbounded The quickest eye commands but a certain length of space and there it is bounded however obscurely But the mind perceives things as they exist and the line is carried on in idea without end In that respect an unbounded prospect is similar to an infinite series In fact the uneasiness of an unbounded prospect differs very little in its feeling from that of an infinite series and therefore we may reasonably conclude that both proceed from the same cause  We next consider a prospect unbounded every way as for example a great plain or the ocean viewed from an eminence We feel here an uneasiness occasioned by the want of an end or termination precisely as in the other cases A prospect unbounded every way is indeed so far singular as at first to be more pleasant than a prospect that is unbounded in one direction only and afterward to be more painful But these circumstances are easily explained without breaking in upon the general theory The pleasure we feel at first is a strong emotion of grandeur arising from the immense extension of the object And to increase the pain we feel afterward for the want of a termination there concurs a pain of a different kind occasioned by stretching the eye to comprehend so great a prospect a pain that gradually increases with the repeated efforts we make to grasp the whole  It is the same principle if I mistake not which operates imperceptibly with respect to quantity and number Another's property indented into my field gives me uneasiness and I am eager to make the purchase not for profit but in order to square my field Xerxes and his army in their passage to Greece were sumptuously entertained by Pythius the Lydian Xerxes getting a particular account of his riches recompensed him with Darics which he wanted to complete the sum of four millions    The final cause of this principle is an additional proof of its existence Human works are of no significancy till they be completed Reason is not always a sufficient counterbalance to indolence and some principle over and above is necessary to excite our industry and to prevent our stopping short in the middle of the course  We need not lose time in describing the cooperation of the foregoing principle with  surprise in producing the effect that is felt upon the appearance of any unusual resemblance or contrast Surprise first operates and carries our opinion of the resemblance or contrast beyond the truth The principle we have been describing carries us still farther for being bent upon gratification it forces upon the mind a conviction that the resemblance or contrast is complete We need no better illustration than the resemblance that is fancied  in some pebbles to a tree or an insect The resemblance however faint in reality is conceived to be wonderfully perfect This tendency to complete a resemblance acting jointly with surprise carries the mind sometimes so far as even to presume upon future events In the Greek tragedy intitled  Phineides  those unhappy women seeing the place where it was intended they should be slain cried out with anguish  "They now saw their cruel destiny had condemned them to die in that place being the same where they had been exposed in their infancy  Aristotle poet cap  "  This remarkable principle which inclines us to advance every thing to its perfection not only cooperates with surprise to deceive the mind but of itself is able to produce that effect Of this we see many instances where there is no place for surprise The first instance I shall give is of resemblance  Unumquodque eodem modo dissolvitur quo colligatum est  is a maxim in the Roman law that has no foundation in truth For tying and  loosing building and demolishing are acts opposite to each other and are performed by opposite means But when these acts are connected by their relation to the same subject their connection leads us to imagine a sort of resemblance betwixt them which the foregoing principle makes us conceive to be as complete as possible The next instance shall be of contrast Addison observes  Spectator N  o      "That the palest features look the most agreeable in white that a face which is overflushed appears to advantage in the deepest scarlet and that a dark complexion is not a little alleviated by a black hood"  The foregoing principle serves to account for these appearances To make this evident one of the cases shall suffice A complexion however dark never approaches to black When these colours appear together their opposition strikes us and the propensity we have to complete the opposition makes the darkness of complexion vanish out of sight  The operation of this principle even  where there is no ground for surprise is not confined to opinion or conviction So powerful is it as to make us sometimes proceed to action in order to complete a resemblance or contrast If this appear obscure it will be made clear by the following instances Upon what principle is the  lex talionis  founded other than to make the punishment resemble the mischief Reason dictates that there ought to be a conformity or resemblance betwixt a crime and its punishment and the foregoing principle impells us to make the resemblance as complete as possible Titus Livius influenced by this principle accounts for a certain punishment by a resemblance betwixt it and the crime far too subtile for common apprehension Speaking of Mettus Fuffetius the Alban general who for treachery to the Romans his allies was sentenced to be torn to pieces by horses he puts the following speech in the mouth of Tullus Hostilius who decreed the punishment  "Mette Fuffeti inquit si ipse discere posses fidem ac foedera servare vivo tibi ea disciplina a me adhibita esset Nunc quoniam  tuum insanabile ingenium est at tu tuo supplicio doce humanum genus ea sancta credere quae a te violata sunt Ut igitur paulo ante animum inter Fidenatem Romanamque rem ancipitem gessisti ita jam corpus passim distrahendum dabis  Lib §  "  By the same influence the sentence is often executed upon the very spot where the crime was committed In the  Electra  of Sophocles Egistheus is dragged from the theatre into an inner room of the supposed palace to suffer death where he murdered Agamemnon Shakespear whose knowledge of nature is not less profound than extensive has not overlooked this propensity  Othello  Get me some poison Iago this night I'll not expostulate with her lest her body and her beauty unprovide my mind again this night Iago  Iago  Do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even in the bed she hath contaminated  Othello  Good good The justice of it pleases very good  Othello act sc  Warwick  From off the gates of York fetch down the head  Your father's head which Clifford placed there  Instead whereof let his supply the room  Measure for measure must be answered  Third Part of Henry VI act sc  Persons in their last moments are generally seized with an anxiety to be buried with their relations In the  Amynta  of Tasso the lover hearing that his mistress was torn to pieces by a wolf expresses a desire to die the same death  Act sc    Upon the subject in general I have two remarks to add The first concerns resemblance which when too entire hath no effect however different in kind the things compared may be This remark is applicable to works of art only for natural objects of different kinds have scarce ever an entire resemblance Marble is a sort of matter very different from what composes an animal and marble cut into a human figure produces great pleasure by the resemblance But let a marble statue be coloured like a  picture the resemblance is so entire as to produce no effect At a distance it appears a real person We discover the mistake when we approach and no other emotion is raised but surprise occasioned by the deception The idea of resemblance is sunk into that of identity The figure still appears to our eyes rather to be a real person than a resemblance of it and we must make use of our reflection to correct the mistake This cannot happen in a picture for the resemblance can never be so entire as to disguise the imitation  The other remark regards contrast Emotions make the greatest figure when contrasted in succession But then the succession ought neither to be precipitate nor immoderately slow If too slow the effect of contrast becomes faint by the distance of the emotions and if precipitate no single emotion has room to expand itself to its full size but is stifled as it were in the birth by a succeeding emotion The funeral oration of the Bishop of Meaux upon the Duchess of Orleans is a perfect hotchpotch of chearful and melancholy representations  following each other in the quickest succession Opposite emotions are best felt in succession but each emotion separately should be raised to its due pitch before another be introduced  What is above laid down will enable us to determine a very important question concerning emotions raised by the fine arts  viz  What ought to be the rule of succession whether ought resemblance to be studied or contrast The emotions raised by the fine arts are generally too nearly related to make a figure by resemblance and for that reason their succession ought to be regulated as much as possible by contrast This holds confessedly in epic and dramatic compositions and the best writers led perhaps by a good taste more than by reasoning have generally aimed at this beauty In the same cantata all the variety of emotions that are within the power of music may not only be indulged but to make the greatest figure ought to be contrasted In gardening there is an additional reason for the rule The emotions raised by that art are at best so faint that  every artifice should be used to give them their utmost strength A field may be laid out in grand sweet gay neat wild melancholy scenes When these are viewed in succession grandeur ought to be contrasted with neatness regularity with wildness and gaiety with melancholy so as that each emotion may succeed its opposite Nay it is an improvement to intermix in the succession rude uncultivated spots as well as unbounded views which in themselves are disagreeable but in succession heighten the feeling of the agreeable objects And we have nature for our guide who in her most beautiful landscapes often intermixes rugged rocks dirty marshes and barren stony heaths The greatest masters of music have the same view in their compositions the second part of an Italian song seldom conveys any sentiment and by its harshness seems purposely contrived to give a greater relish for the interesting parts of the composition  A small garden comprehended under a single view affords little opportunity for this embellishment Dissimilar emotions  require different tones of mind and therefore in conjunction can never make a good figure  See chap part  Gaiety and sweetness may be combined or wildness and gloominess but a composition of gaiety and gloominess is distasteful The rude uncultivated copartment of furze and broom in Richmond garden hath a good effect in the succession of objects but a spot of this nature would be insufferable in the midst of a polished parterre or flowerplot A garden therefore if not of great extent will not admit of dissimilar emotions And in ornamenting a small garden the safest course is to confine it to a single expression For the same reason a landscape ought also to be confined to a single expression It is accordingly a rule in painting That if the subject be gay every figure ought to contribute to that emotion  It follows from the foregoing train of reasoning that a garden near a great city ought to have an air of solitude The solitariness again of a waste country ought to  be contrasted in forming a garden no temples no obscure walks but  jets d'eau  cascades objects active gay and splendid Nay such a garden should in some measure avoid imitating nature by taking on an extraordinary appearance of regularity and art to show the busy hand of man which in a waste country has a fine effect by contrast  It may be gathered from what is said above  Chap part  that wit and ridicule make not an agreeable mixture with grandeur Dissimilar emotions have a fine effect in a slow succession but in a rapid succession which approaches to coexistence they will not be relished In the midst of a laboured and elevated description of a battle Virgil introduces a ludicrous image which is certainly out of its place  Obvius ambustum torrem Chorinaeus ab ara  Corripit et venienti Ebuso plagamque ferenti  Occupat os flammis illi ingens barba reluxit  Nidoremque ambusta dedit  Aen xii  The following image is not less ludicrous nor less improperly placed  Mentre fan questi i bellici stromenti  Perche debbiano tosto in uso porse  Il gran nemico de l'humane genti  Contra i Christiani i lividi occhi torse  E lor veggendo à le bell' opre intenti  Ambo le labra per furor si morse  E qual tauro ferito il suo dolore  Verso mugghiando e sospirando fuore  Gierusal cant st  It would however be too austere to banish altogether ludicrous images from an epic poem This poem doth not always soar above the clouds It admits great variety and upon occasions can descend even to the ground without sinking In its more familiar tones a ludicrous scene may be introduced without impropriety This is done by Virgil  Aen lib  in describing a footrace the circumstances of which not excepting the ludicrous part are copied from Homer  Iliad book l  After a fit of merryment we are  it is true the less disposed to the serious and sublime but then a ludicrous scene by unbending the mind from severe application to more interesting subjects may prevent fatigue and preserve our relish entire  CHAP IX Of Uniformity and Variety  WHEN I apply myself to explain uniformity and variety and to show how we are affected by these circumstances it appears doubtful what method ought to be followed I foresee several difficulties in keeping close to my text and yet by indulging a range such as may be necessary for a clear view I shall certainly incur the censure of wanderingBe it so One ought not to abandon the right track for fear of censure The collateral matters beside that will be introduced are curious and not of slight importance in the science of human nature  The necessary succession of perceptions is a subject formerly handled so far as it depends on the relations of objects and their  mutual connections  Chap  But that subject is not exhausted and I take the liberty to introduce it a second time in order to explain in what manner we are affected by uniformity and variety The world we inhabit is replete with things not less remarkable for their variety than their number These unfolded by the wonderful mechanism of external sense furnish the mind with many perceptions which joined with ideas of memory of imagination and of reflection form a complete train that has not a gap or interval This tide of objects in a continual flux is in a good measure independent of will The mind as has been observed  Locke book chap  is so constituted  "That it can by no effort break off the succession of its ideas nor keep its attention long fixt upon the same object"  We can arrest a perception in its course we can shorten its natural duration to make room for another we can vary the succession by change of place or amusement and we can in some measure  prevent variety by frequently recalling the same object after short intervals but still there must be a succession and a change from one thing to another By artificial means the succession may be retarded or accelerated may be rendered more various or more uniform but in one shape or other is unavoidable  The rate of succession even when left to its ordinary course is not always the same There are natural causes that accelerate or retard it considerably The first I shall mention depends on a peculiar constitution of mind One man is distinguished from another by no circumstance more remarkably than the movement of his train of perceptions A cold languid temper is accompanied with a slow course of perceptions which occasions dulness of apprehension and sluggishness in action To a warm temper on the contrary belongs a quick course of perceptions which occasions quickness of apprehension and activity in business The Asiatic nations the Chinese especially are observed to be more cool and deliberate than the Europeans may not  the reason be that heat enervates by exhausting the spirits A certain degree of cold such as is felt in the middle regions of Europe by bracing the fibres rouses the mind and produces a brisk circulation of thought accompanied with vigour in action In youth there is observable a quicker succession of perceptions than in old age Hence in youth a remarkable avidity for variety of amusements which in riper years give place to more uniform and more sedate occupation This qualifies men of middle age for business where activity is required but with a greater proportion of uniformity than variety In old age a slow and languid succession makes variety unnecessary and for that reason the aged in all their motions are generally governed by an habitual uniformity Whatever be the cause we may venture to pronounce that heat in the imagination and temper is always connected with a brisk flow of perceptions  The natural rate of succession depends also in some degree upon the particular perceptions that compose the train An agreeable  object taking a strong hold of the mind occasions a slower succession than when the objects are indifferent Grandeur and novelty fix the attention for a considerable time excluding all other ideas and the mind thus occupied feels no vacuity Some emotions by hurrying the mind from object to object accelerate the succession Where the train is composed of connected objects the succession is quick For it is so ordered by nature that the mind goes easily and sweetly along connected objects  See chap  On the other hand the succession must be slow where the train is composed of unconnected objects An unconnected object finding no ready access to the mind requires time to make an impression And that it is not admitted without a struggle appears from the unsettled state of the mind for some moments after it is presented wavering betwixt it and the former train During this short period one or other of the former objects will intrude perhaps oftener than once till the attention be fixt entirely upon  the new object The same observations are applicable to ideas suggested by language The mind can bear a quick succession of related ideas But an unrelated idea for which the mind is not prepared takes time to make a distinct impression and therefore a train composed of such ideas ought to proceed with a slow pace Hence an epic poem a play or any story connected in all its parts may be perused in a shorter time than a book of maxims or apothegms of which a quick succession creates both confusion and fatigue  Such latitude hath nature indulged in the rate of succession What latitude it indulges with respect to uniformity we proceed to examine The uniformity or variety of a train so far as composed of external objects depends on the particular objects that surround the percipient at the time The present occupation must also have an influence one is sometimes engaged in a multiplicity of affairs sometimes altogether vacant A natural train of ideas of memory is more circumscribed each object being linked by some connection to what precedes  and to what follows it These connections which are many and of different kinds afford scope for a sufficient degree of variety and at the same time prevent any excess that is unpleasant Temper and constitution also have an influence here as well as upon the rate of succession A man of a calm and sedate temper admits not willingly any idea but what is regularly introduced by a proper connection One of a roving disposition embraces with avidity every new idea however slender its relation be to those that go before it Neither must we overlook the nature of the perceptions that compose the train for their influence is not less with respect to uniformity and variety than with respect to the rate of succession The mind ingrossed by any passion love or hatred hope or fear broods over its object and can bear no interruption In such a state the train of perceptions must not only be slow but extremely uniform Anger newly inflamed eagerly grasps its object and leaves not a cranny in the mind for another thought than of revenge In the character of Hotspur this state of mind  is represented to the life a picture remarkable for high colouring as well as for strictness of imitation  Worcester  Peace cousin say no more  And now I will unclasp a secret book  And to your quickconceiving discontents  I'll read you matter deep and dangerous  As full of peril and advent'rous spirit  As to o'erwalk a current roaring loud  On the unsteadfast

give it him  To keep his anger still in motion  Worcester  Hear you cousin a word  Hotspur  All studies here I solemnly defy  Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke  And that same swordandbuckler Prince of Wales  But that I think his father loves him not  And would be glad he met with some mischance  I'd have him poison'd with a pot of ale  Worcester  Farewel my kinsman I will talk to you  When you are better temper'd to attend  First part Henry IV act sc  Having viewed a train of perceptions as directed by nature and the variations it is susceptible of from different necessary causes we proceed to examine how far it is subjected to will for that will hath some influence more or less is observed above And first the rate of succession may be retarded by insisting upon one object and  propelled by dismissing another before its time But such voluntary mutations in the natural course of succession have limits that cannot be extended by the most painful efforts The mind circumscribed in its capacity cannot at the same instant admit many perceptions and when replete it has no place for new perceptions till others be removed For this reason a voluntary change of perceptions cannot be instantaneous and the time it requires sets bounds to the velocity of succession On the other hand the power we have to arrest a flying perception is equally limited The longer we detain any perception the more difficulty we find in the operation till the difficulty becoming unsurmountable we are forced to quit our hold and to permit the train to take its usual course  The power we have over this train as to uniformity and variety is in some cases very great in others very little A train so far as composed of external objects depends entirely on the place we occupy and admits not more or less variety but by change of place A train composed of ideas of memory  is still less under our power Objects which are connected afford the mind an easy passage from one to another They suggest each other in idea by the same means and we cannot at will call up any idea that is not connected with the train  See chap  But a train of ideas suggested by reading may be varied at will provided we have books in store  This power which nature hath given us over our train of perceptions may be greatly strengthened by proper discipline and by an early application to business Its improved strength is remarkable in those who have a strong genius for the mathematics nor less remarkable in persons devoted to religious exercises who pass whole days in contemplation and impose upon themselves long and severe penances It is not to be conceived what length a habit of activity in affairs will carry some men Let a stranger or let any person to whom the sight is not familiar attend the Chancellor of Great Britain through the labours but of one day  during a session of parliament how great will be his astonishment what multiplicity of lawbusiness what deep thinking and what elaborate application to matters of government The train of perceptions must in this great man be accelerated far beyond the common course of nature Yet no confusion nor hurry but in every article the greatest order and accuracy Such is the force of habit How happy is man to have the command of a principle of action that can elevate him so far above the ordinary condition of humanity  This chapter was composed in the year    We are now ripe for considering a train of perceptions with respect to pleasure and pain and to this speculation we must give peculiar attention because it serves to explain the effects that uniformity and variety have upon the mind A man is always in a pleasant state of mind when his perceptions flow in their natural course He feels himself free light and easy especially after any forcible acceleration or retardation On the other hand the resistance felt in retarding or accelerating the natural course excites a pain which though scarcely felt  in small removes becomes considerable toward the extremes An aversion to fix on any single object for a long time or to take in a multiplicity of objects in a short time is remarkable in children and equally so in men unaccustomed to business A man languishes when the succession is very slow and if he grow not impatient is apt to fall asleep During a rapid succession he hath a feeling as if his head were turning round He is fatigued and his pain resembles that of weariness after bodily labour External objects when they occasion a very slow or a very quick succession produce a pain of the same sort with what it felt in a voluntary retardation or acceleration which shows that the pain proceeds not from the violence of the action but from the retardation or acceleration itself disturbing that free and easy course of succession which is naturally pleasant  But the mind is not satisfied with a moderate course alone its perceptions must also be sufficiently diversified Number without variety constitutes not an agreeable train In comparing a few objects uniformity  is agreeable but the frequent reiteration of uniform objects becomes unpleasant One tires of a scene that is not diversified and soon feels a sort of unnatural restraint when confined within a narrow range whether occasioned by a retarded succession or by too great uniformity An excess in variety is on the other hand fatiguing This is even perceptible in a train composed of related objects much more where the objects are unrelated for an object unconnected with the former train gains not admittance without effort and this effort though scarce perceptible in a single instance becomes by frequent reiteration exceeding painful Whatever be the cause the fact is certain that a man never finds himself more at ease than when his perceptions succeed each other with a certain degree not only of velocity but also of variety Hence it proceeds that a train consisting entirely of ideas of memory is never painful by too great variety because such ideas are not introduced otherwise than according to their natural connections  Chap  The pleasure  of a train of ideas is the most remarkable in a reverie especially where the imagination interposes and is active in coining new ideas which is done with wonderful facility One must be sensible that the serenity and ease of the mind in this state makes a great part of the enjoyment The case is different where external objects enter into the train for these making their appearance without any order and without any connection save that of contiguity form a train of perceptions that may be extremely uniform or extremely diversified which for opposite reasons are both of them painful  Any acceleration or retardation of the natural run of perceptions is painful even where it is voluntary And it is equally painful to alter that degree of variety which nature requires Contemplation when the mind is long attached to one thing soon becomes painful by restraining the free range of perception Curiosity and the prospect of advantage from useful discoveries may engage a man to prosecute his studies notwithstanding the pain they give him  and a habit of close attention formed by frequent exercise may soften the pain But it is deeply felt by the bulk of mankind and produceth in them an aversion to all abstract sciences In any profession or calling a train of operation that is simple and reiterated without intermission makes the operator languish and lose his vigor He complains neither of too great labour nor of too little action but regrets the want of variety and his being obliged to do the same thing over and over Where the operation is sufficiently varied the mind retains its vigor and is pleased with its condition Actions again create an uneasiness when excessive in number or variety though in every other respect agreeable This uneasiness is extremely remarkable where strict attention must be given at the same time to a number of different things Thus a throng of business in law in physic or in traffick distresseth and distracts the mind unless where a habit of application is acquired by long and constant exercise The excessive variety is the distressing circumstance and the mind suffers  grievously by being kept constantly upon the stretch  With relation to involuntary causes disturbing that degree of variety which nature requires a slight pain affecting one part of the body without variation becomes by its constancy and long duration almost insupportable The patient sensible that the pain is not increased in degree complains of its constancy more than of its severity that it ingrosses his whole thoughts and gives admission to no other object Pain of all feelings seizes the attention with the greatest force and the mind after fruitless efforts to turn its view to objects more agreeable must abandon itself to its tormentor A shifting pain gives less uneasiness because change of place contributes to variety An intermitting pain suffering other objects to intervene is not increased by reiteration Again any single colour or sound often returning becomes disagreeable as may be observed in viewing a train of similar apartments painted with the same colour and in hearing the prolonged tollings of a bell Colour and  sound varied within certain limits though without any order are agreeable witness a field variegated with many colours of plants and flowers and the various notes of birds in a thicket Increase the number or variety and the feeling becomes unpleasant Thus a great variety of colours crowded upon a small canvas or in quick succession create an uneasy feeling which is prevented by putting the colours at a greater distance either of place or time A number of voices in a crowded assembly a number of animals collected in a market produce an unpleasant emotion though a few of them together or all of them in a moderate succession would be agreeable And because of the same excess in variety a number of pains felt in different parts of the body at the same instant or in a rapid succession make an exquisite torture  The foregoing doctrine concerning the train of perceptions and the pleasure or pain resulting from that train in different circumstances will be confirmed by attending to the final cause of these effects And as I am sensible that the mind inflamed with  speculations of this kind so highly interesting is beyond measure disposed to conviction I shall be watchful to admit no argument nor remark but what appears solidly founded With this caution I proceed to the inquiry It is occasionally observed above that persons of a phlegmatic temperament having a sluggish train of perceptions are indisposed to action and that activity constantly accompanies a brisk motion of perceptions To ascertain this fact a man need not go abroad for experiments Reflecting upon things passing in his own mind he will find that a brisk circulation of thought constantly prompts him to action and that he is averse to action when his perceptions languish in their course But man by nature is formed for action and he must be active in order to be happy Nature therefore hath kindly provided against indolence by annexing pleasure to a moderate course of perceptions and by making every remarkable retardation painful A slow course of perceptions is attended with another bad effect Man in a few capital cases is governed by propensity or  instinct but in matters that admit deliberation and choice reason is assigned him for a guide Now as reasoning requires often a great compass of ideas their succession ought to be so quick as readily to furnish every motive that may be necessary for mature deliberation In a languid succession motives will often occur after action is commenced when it is too late to retreat  Nature hath guarded man her favourite against a succession too rapid not less carefully than against one too slow Both are equally painful though the pain is not the same in both Many are the good effects of this contrivance In the first place as the bodily faculties are by certain painful sensations confined within proper limits beyond which it would be dangerous to strain the tender organs Nature in like manner is equally provident with respect to the nobler faculties of the mind Thus the pain of an accelerated course of perceptions is Nature's admonition to relax our pace and to admit a more gentle exertion of thought Another valuable purpose may be gathered from considering in what manner objects  are imprinted upon the mind To make such an impression as to give the memory fast hold of the object time is required even where attention is the greatest and a moderate degree of attention which is the common case must be continued still longer to produce the same effect A rapid succession then must prevent objects from making impressions so deep as to be of real service in life and Nature accordingly for the sake of memory has by a painful feeling guarded against a rapid succession But a still more valuable purpose is answered by this contrivance As on the one hand a sluggish course of perceptions indisposeth to action so on the other a course too rapid impels to rash and precipitant action Prudent conduct is the child of deliberation and clear conception for which there is no place in a rapid course of thought Nature therefore taking measures for prudent conduct has guarded us effectually from precipitancy of thought by making it painful  Nature not only provides against a succession too slow or too quick but makes the middle course extremely pleasant Nor is  this middle course confined within narrow bounds Every man can naturally without pain accelerate or retard in some degree the rate of his perceptions and he can do this in a still greater degree by the force of habit Thus a habit of contemplation annihilates the pain of a retarded course of perceptions and a busy life after long practice makes acceleration pleasant  Concerning the final cause of our taste for variety it will be considered that human affairs complex by variety as well as number require the distributing our attention and activity in measure and proportion Nature therefore to secure a just distribution corresponding to the variety of human affairs has made too great uniformity or too great variety in the course of our perceptions equally unpleasant And indeed were we addicted to either extreme our internal constitution would be ill suited to our external circumstances At the same time where a frequent reiteration of the same operation is required as in several manufactures or a quick circulation as in law or physic Nature attentive to all our wants hath also provided  for these cases She hath implanted in the breast of every person an efficacious principle which leads to habit By an obstinate perseverance in the same occupation the pain of excessive uniformity vanisheth and by the like perseverance in a quick circulation of different occupations the pain of excessive variety vanisheth And thus we come to take delight in several occupations that by nature without habit are not a little disgustful  A middle rate also in our train of perceptions betwixt uniformity and variety is not less pleasant than betwixt quickness and slowness The mind of man thus constituted is wonderfully adapted to the course of human affairs which are continually changing but not without connection It is equally adapted to the acquisition of knowledge which results chiefly from discovering resemblances among differing objects and differences among resembling objects Such occupation even abstracting from the knowledge we acquire is in itself delightful by preserving a middle rate betwixt too great uniformity and too great variety  We are now arrived at the chief purpose of the present chapter and that is to examine how far uniformity or variety ought to be studied in the fine arts And the knowledge we have obtained will even at first view suggest a general observation That in every work of art it must be agreeable to find that degree of variety which corresponds to the natural course of our perceptions and that an excess in variety or in uniformity must be disagreeable by varying that natural course For this reason works of art admit more or less variety according to the nature of the subject In a picture that strongly attaches the spectator to a single object the mind relisheth not a multiplicity of figures or of ornaments A picture again representing a gay subject admits great variety of figures and ornaments because these are agreeable to the mind in a chearful tone The same observation is applicable to poetry and to music  It must at the same time be remarked that one can bear a greater variety of natural objects than of objects in a picture and a greater variety in a picture than in a description  A real object presented to the view makes an impression more readily than when represented in colours and much more readily than when represented in words Hence it is that the profuse variety of objects in some natural landscapes neither breed confusion nor fatigue And for the same reason there is place for greater variety of ornament in a picture than in a poem  From these general observations I proceed to particulars In works exposed continually to public view variety ought to be studied It is a rule accordingly in sculpture to contrast the different limbs of a statue in order to give it all the variety possible Though the cone in a single view be more beautiful than the pyramid yet a pyramidal steeple because of its variety is justly preferred For the same reason the oval in compositions is preferred before the circle and painters in copying buildings or any regular work endeavour to give an air of variety by representing the subject in an angular view we are pleased with the variety without losing  sight of the regularity In a landscape representing animals those especially of the same kind contrast ought to prevail To draw one sleeping another awake one sitting another in motion one moving toward the spectator another from him is the life of such a performance  In every sort of writing intended for amusement variety is necessary in proportion to the length of the work Want of variety is sensibly felt in Davila's history of the civil wars of France The events are indeed important and various but the reader languisheth by a tiresome uniformity of character every person engaged being figured a consummate politician governed by interest only It is hard to say whether Ovid disgusts more by too great variety or too great uniformity His stories are all of the same kind concluding invariably with the transformation of one being into another So far he is tiresome with excess in uniformity He also fatigues with excess in variety by hurrying his reader incessantly from story to story Ariosto is still more fatiguing than Ovid by exceeding the just bounds of variety  Not satisfied like Ovid with a succession in his stories he distracts the reader by jumbling together a multitude of unconnected events Nor is the Orlando Furioso less tiresome by its uniformity than the Metamorphoses though in a different manner After a story is brought to a crisis the reader intent upon the catastrophe is suddenly snatched away to a new story which is little regarded so long as the mind is occupied with the former This tantalizing method from which the author never once swerves during the course of a long work beside its uniformity hath another bad effect it prevents that sympathy which is raised by an interesting event when the reader meets with no interruption  The emotions produced by our perceptions in a train have been little considered and less understood The subject therefore required an elaborate discussion It may surprise some readers to find variety treated as only contributing to make a train of perceptions pleasant when it is commonly held to be a necessary ingredient in beauty of whatever kind according to the  definition  "That beauty consists in uniformity amidst variety"  But after the subject is explained and illustrated as above I presume it will be evident that this definition however applicable to one or other species is far from being just with respect to beauty in general Variety contributes no share to the beauty of a moral action nor of a mathematical theorem and numberless are the beautiful objects of sight that have little or no variety in them A globe the most uniform of all figures is of all the most beautiful and a square though more beautiful than a trapezium hath less variety in its constituent parts The foregoing definition which at best is but obscurely expressed is only applicable to a number of objects in a group or in succession among which indeed a due mixture of uniformity and variety is always agreeable provided the particular objects separately considered be in any degree beautiful Uniformity amidst variety among ugly objects affords no pleasure This circumstance is totally omitted in the definition and indeed to have mentioned it would at first glance  show the definition to be imperfect To define beauty as arising from beautiful objects blended together in a due proportion of uniformity and variety would be too gross to pass current as nothing can be more gross than to employ in a definition the very term that is proposed to be explained  APPENDIX to Chap IX Concerning the works of nature  IN natural objects whether we regard their internal or external structure beauty and design are equally conspicuous We shall begin with the outside of nature as what first presents itself  The figure of an organic body is generally regular The trunk of a tree its branches and their ramifications are nearly round and form a series regularly decreasing from the trunk to the smallest fibre Uniformity is no where more remarkable  than in the leaves which in the same species have all the same colour size and shape The seeds and fruits are all regular figures approaching for the most part to the globular form Hence a plant especially of the larger kind with its trunk branches foliage and fruit is a delightful object  In an animal the trunk which is much larger than the other parts occupies a chief place Its shape like that of the stem of plants is nearly round a figure which of all is the most agreeable Its two sides are precisely similar Several of the under parts go off in pairs and the two individuals of each pair are accurately uniform The single parts are placed in the middle The limbs bearing a certain proportion to the trunk serve to support it and to give it a proper elevation Upon one extremity are disposed the neck and head in the direction of the trunk The head being the chief part possesses with great propriety the chief place Hence the beauty of the whole figure is the result of many equal and proportional parts orderly disposed and the smallest variation in number equality proportion  or order never fails to produce a perception of ugliness and deformity  Nature in no particular seems more profuse of ornament than in the beautiful colouring of her works The flowers of plants the furs of beasts and the feathers of birds vie with each other in the beauty of their colours which in lustre as well as in harmony are beyond the power of imitation Of all natural appearances the colouring of the human face is the most exquisite It is the strongest instance of the ineffable art of nature in adapting and proportioning its colours to the magnitude figure and position of the parts In a word colour seems to live in nature only and to languish under the finest touches of art  When we examine the internal structure of a plant or animal a wonderful subtility of mechanism is displayed Man in his mechanical operations is confined to the surface of bodies But the operations of nature are exerted through the whole substance so as to reach even the elementary parts Thus the body of an animal and of a plant are composed of certain great  vessels these of smaller and these again of still smaller without end so far we can discover This power of diffusing mechanism through the most intimate parts is peculiar to nature and distinguishes her operations most remarkably from every work of art Such texture continued from the grosser parts to the most minute preserves all along the strictest regularity The fibres of plants are a bundle of cylindric canals lying in the same direction and parallel or nearly parallel to each other In some instances a most accurate arrangement of parts is discovered as in onions formed of concentric coats one within another to the very centre An animal body is still more admirable in the disposition of its internal parts and in their order and symmetry There is not a bone a muscle a bloodvessel a nerve that hath not one corresponding to it on the opposite side of the animal and the same order is carried through the most minute parts The lungs are composed of two parts which are disposed upon the sides of the thorax and the kidneys in a lower situation have a  position not less orderly As to the parts that are single the heart is advantageously situated nigh the middle The liver stomach and spleen are disposed in the upper region of the abdomen about the same height the bladder is placed in the middle of the body as well as the intestinal canal which fills the whole cavity by its convolutions  The mechanical power of nature not confined to small bodies reacheth equally those of the greatest size witness the bodies that compose the solar system which however large are weighed measured and subjected to certain laws with the utmost accuracy Their places around the sun with their distances are determined by a precise rule corresponding to their quantities of matter The superior dignity of the central body in respect of its bulk and lucid appearance is suited to the place it occupies The globular figure of these bodies is not only in itself beautiful but is above all others fitted for regular motion Each planet revolves about its own axis in a given time and each moves round the sun in an orbit  nearly circular and in a time proportioned to its distance Their velocities directed by an established law are perpetually changing by regular accelerations and retardations In fine the great variety of regular appearances joined with the beauty of the system itself cannot fail to produce the highest delight in every person who can taste design power or beauty  Nature hath a wonderful power of connecting systems with each other and of propagating that connection through all her works Thus the constituent parts of a plant the roots the stem the branches the leaves the fruit are really different systems united by a mutual dependence on each other Thus in an animal the lymphatic and lacteal ducts the bloodvessels and nerves the muscles and glands the bones and cartilages the membranes and viscera with the other organs form distinct systems which are united into one whole There are at the same time other connections less intimate Thus every plant is joined to the earth by its roots it requires rain and dews to furnish it with juices and  it requires heat to preserve these juices in fluidity and motion Thus every animal by its gravity is connected with the earth with the element in which it breathes and with the sun by deriving from it cherishing and enlivening heat The earth furnisheth aliment to plants these to animals and these again to other animals in a long train of dependence That the earth is part of a greater system comprehending many bodies mutually attracting each other and gravitating all toward one common centre is now thoroughly explored Such a regular and uniform series of connections propagated through so great a number of beings and through such wide spaces is wonderful and our wonder must increase when we observe this connection propagated from the minutest atoms to bodies of the most enormous size and widely diffused so as that we can neither perceive its beginning nor its end That it doth not terminate within our own planetary system is certain The connection is diffused over spaces still more remote where new bodies and systems rise to our view without end All space is filled with the  works of God which being the operation of one hand are formed by one plan to answer one great end  But the most wonderful connection of all though not the most conspicuous is that of our internal frame with the works of nature Man is obviously fitted for contemplating these works because in this contemplation he has great delight The works of nature are remarkable in their uniformity not less than in their variety and the mind of man is fitted to receive pleasure equally from both Uniformity and variety are interwoven in the works of nature with surprising art Variety however great is never without some degree of uniformity nor the greatest uniformity without some degree of variety There is great variety in the same plant by the different appearances of its stem branches leaves blossoms fruit size and colour and yet when we trace this variety through different plants especially of the same kind there is discovered a surprising uniformity Again where nature seems to have intended the most exact uniformity  as among individuals of the same kind there still appears a diversity which serves readily to distinguish one individual from another It is indeed admirable that the human visage in which uniformity is so prevalent should yet be so marked as to leave no room for mistaking one person for another The difference though clearly perceived is often so minute as to go beyond the reach of description A correspondence so perfect betwixt the human mind and the works of nature is extremely remarkable The opposition betwixt variety and uniformity is so great that one would not readily imagine they could both be relished by the same palate at least not in the same object nor at the same time It is however true that the pleasures they afford being happily adjusted to each other and readily mixing in intimate union are frequently produced in perfection by the same individual object Nay further in the objects that touch us the most uniformity and variety are constantly combined witness natural objects where this combination is always found in perfection It is  for that reason that natural objects readily form themselves into groups and are agreeable in whatever manner combined a wood with its trees shrubs and herbs is agreeable the music of birds the lowing of cattle and the murmuring of a brook are in conjunction delightful though they strike the ear without modulation or harmony In short nothing can be more happily accommodated to the inward constitution of man than that mixture of uniformity with variety which the eye discovers in natural objects And accordingly the mind is never more highly gratified than in contemplating a natural landscape  End of the FIRST VOLUME
