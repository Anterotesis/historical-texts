following POEMS are humbly inscrib'd by His LORDSHIP's Much Oblig'd and Ever Grateful Humble Servant HENRY JONES  Advertisement  IT may be proper to inform the Reader that the most Part of the

generous Encouragement he met with from some Persons of Distinction to whom he had the Honour of being made known determined him to offer his Productions to the Publick It will be needless perhaps to declare that he has had no Assistance from Learning He takes this Opportunity of returning Thanks to all his Subscribers and generous Benefactors declaring his Ambition to extend no farther than that of producing something not altogether unworthy their Countenance and Favour  A LIST OF THE NAMES OF THE SUBSCRIBERS  A  THE Right Hon the Earl of Ashburnham  The Right Hon the Earl of Abercorn  Lady

CHESTERFIELD  'S Arrival in  Ireland  A Midst th'Applause which Art and Learning brings  Listen O STANHOPE to what Nature sings  Tho' rude the Notes yet noble is the Choice  The Subject only can support the Voice  Illustrious Guest whose happy Wisdom's known  To  Belgian  Councils as to  Britain  's Throne  Whose Tongue inspir'd an unresolving State  And fix'd  Britannia  's as  Europa  's Fate  Fir'd with the Glories of thy splendid Name  Thro' various Climates still pursu'd by Fame  To thee a Muse untaught in  Latian  Lays  Or  Grecian  Stile her Voice obscure would raise  Wrapt in the Theme sublime would proudly soar  And sound thy Welcome to her native Shore  Thee even Factions with one Voice require  And Heav'n and  George  indulge the strong Desire  See bending Crowds with willing Hearts obey  And grateful own the delegated Sway  Tho' ne'er great  Brunswick  to  Hibernia  rise  But shines afar and gladens other Skies  His godlike Pow'r beneficent we view  Effulgent and reflected all from you  Lo thus the Silver Substitute of Day  Supplies his Absence with a borrow'd Ray  O'er the gay Globe with gentle Beam presides  Chears the wild Waste and rules the teeming Tides  Whose heaving Bosom swells the publick Store  With Wealth and Plenty from each distant Shore  In Expectation flocks the tuneful Throng  And glows to hail thee with a grateful Song  As Birds exulting on the eager Wing  Salute the Dawnings of the gladsome Spring  Their pouring Throats employ from Spray to Spray  To greet the Sun and bless the genial Day  Each raptur'd Muse shall now resume her Lyre  Swell the full Chords and sweep the sounding Wyre  Sacred to thee the melting Strain shall flow  To thee the Numbers and the Strains they owe  Thrice happy Genius in whose Soul conspire  The Statesman's Wisdom and the Poet's Fire  O Friend to Arts revive our drooping Isle  And make those Arts by thy Indulgence smile  Ev'n here thy Presence shall their Strength restore  Tho'  Congreve Steel Roscommon  are no more  Tho'  Morrice  modest hides his heav'nly Strains  And  Britain  's Senate noble  Boyle  detains  Tho'  Swift  be dumb for  Swift Ierne  weeps  The Pride the Parent of his Country sleeps  His clouded Soul now darts no dazling Ray  And faintly warms the animated Clay  Not  Rome  's sad Ruins such Impressions leave  As Reason bury'd in the Body's Grave  His living Lines shall mix their sacred Fire  In Nature's Blaze and with thy Works expire  Nor you great Sir on these weak Numbers frown  Which mourn a  Swift  and sing thy just Renown  Such Strains alas as my unletter'd Hand  Trembling would reach thee on the crowded Strand  But thronging Thousands intercept my Way  And deaf'ning Io's drown my feeble Lay  Yet if a Moment from the Toils of State  And all the Burthen of a Kingdom's Weight  Some little Leisure to the Muse you lend  Each leisure Moment is the Muse's Friend  Permit my Lord that my unpolish'd Lays  May hope for Pardon tho' they fail to please  To the Right Honourable the Countess of  CHFSTERFIELD  occasioned by her procuring a Pardon for two Soldiers condemned for Desertion  WHat means this dismal Sound that March so slow  This solemn Sadness and this Pomp of Woe  Behold two Victims pale and trembling led  Already number'd with th' unheeded Dead  What ghastly Terrors on each Brow we trace  See Death imprinted on each dying Face  Yet Love of Life asserts its eager Claim  But Hope alas affords no flatt'ring Gleam  Lo the pale King in horrid Pomp appears  What cruel Eye could then refrain from Tears  What Heart relentless then forbear to melt  Who saw their Sorrows but like Sorrows felt  How sad the Conflict how severe the Strife  Of Wretches clinging to the Verge of Life  When angry Justice claim'd her promis'd Prey  And frown'd vindictive on the kind Delay  Thy saving Mercy in that Moment flew  The darling Attribute of Heav'n and You  To soft Compassion won thy willing Lord  His Justice temp'ring sheath'd th' uplifted Sword  And in that dismal that tremendous Hour  Snatch'd the pale Victims from th' offended Pow'r  As when by adverse Stars or Chance misled  Entic'd by Lucre or impell'd by Dread  A Wretch from some high Rock's stupendous Brow  Hangs o'er the Waves and dreadful Depths below  The slender Bough he grasps his only Stay  Yields to his Weight and more and more gives Way  Of Hope abandon'd as the Branch he tears  He views th' Abyss and as he views despairs  'Till some unhop'dfor Hand prevents his Doom  Lifts him to Life and lengthen'd Years to come  Redeem'd from Fate nor yet restor'd to Life  They wond'ring pause and feel a doubtful Strife  If still on Earth they breathe with Human Race  Or mix with Shades in Death's obscure Embrace  'Till dawning Hope the dubious Horror clears  Reveals their Safety and dispels their Fears  Loud Shouts of Triumph waft thy Name on high  And  Stanhope  's Goodness fills the vaulted Sky  Oh hadst thou Power afflicted Realms to spare  And rescue  Europe  from the Waste of War  Fell Rage and Discord at thy Nod should cease  And all Mankind enjoy the Sweets of Peace  Then human Blood should deluge Earth no more  But Leagues of Commerce join each distant Shore  You like the Dove the friendly Branch should bring  And blooming Olives in each Climate spring  A golden Age the guilty Globe should see  And  Scotia  faithful as  Hibernia  be  No Feuds intestine in her Bosom jar  No Breath rebellious wakes the Trump of War  Her martial Tribe a generous Fervour feels  And Virtue's Strength each steadfast Hero steels  For Truth and Freedom firmly they unite  And stand resolv'd to tempt the hardy Fight  Thy  Stanhope  's Presence shall each Patriot fire  And  George  's Glory all their Souls inspire  On the  SPRING  THE mounting Sun with gladsome Ray  Makes wanton Nature smile  Each Field looks green each Garden gay  And Birds rejoice the while  The surly Winter's now no more  The lovely Spring prevails  No Tempests dash the sounding Shore  Or burst the rending Sails  Soft Breezes breathing through the Grove  Already deck'd in Green  Invite the Thrush and Turtle Dove  With  Philomel  their Queen  In Lays of Love they waste the Day  While she enchants the Night  Her Bosom leaning on some Spray  To give the Gloom delight  The smiling Shepherd now beholds  With Joy his teeming Flocks  And drives them bleating to their Folds  Amid the vocal Rocks  The lusty Swain with Rapture steals  By yonder friendly Shade  Where with Love Songs and soothing Tales  He charms the list'ning Maid  Since  Flora  now her Mantle throws  On that tall Mountain's Head  So lately crown'd with Winter's Snows  By surly  Boreas  shed  To  Phoebus  ' Praise let Poets sing  And sweep their joyful Lyres  Whose chearful Beam restores the Spring  And ev'ry Bard inspires  On the Lyingin Hospital in  Dublin  ON outstretch'd Wings of glorious Seraphs borne  More bright than Ev'ning Bow or radiant Morn  Lo Charity from Heav'n descends  And Heav'nly Joy her Train attends  Serenely meek in Smiles array'd  Seraphic Ardours on her wait  Celestial Virtues shine display'd  Celestial Pomp adorns her State  Around her Throne obsequious move  Soft Compassion pious Love  Melting Pity Hopes that chear  And from the Wretched drive Despair  Divine Benevolence before her stands  Grace in her Smiles and Bounty in her Hands  She comes Religion to restore  To banish Care from ev'ry Breast  To raise the Sick relieve the Poor  And give the Weak and Weary'd Rest  All hail celestial Goddess hail  O Charity sublime  Propitious spread thy sacred Veil  And cover every Crime  Thy Sacrifice all Sin attones  And still accepted mounts on high  You ease the lab'ring Mother's Groans  You hush the Orphan's Cry  You brighten ev'ry Mortal Gloom  You soften Anguish banish Strife  You take the helpless Infant from the Womb  And hand it smiling into Life  Devote to thee  Here Goddess see  Thy Vot'ries kneel  They fervent feel  Thy Soulexalting Fire  Rejoic'd they rise  Above the Skies  Where heav'nly Minds aspire  Celestial Guest  Inflame each Breast  With social Ardours mutual Love  Still more refin'd  Make Humankind  Till each be like the Bless'd above  Lines to Lord Chief Justice  SINGLETON  WITH love of lasting Fame inspir'd  I hung o'er  Swift  's immortal Page  His matchless Energy admir'd  And kindl'd with poetick Rage  Methought in  A fine Seat near  Drogheda  where his Lordship and the Author were born  Bewly  's blissful Shade  I lay near  Boyne  's smooth flowing Tide  Where aged Elms their Arms display'd  Close by a chrystal Fountain Side  There to my ravish'd Sight arose  All Nature's Charms all  Eden  's Spring  Th' enamel'd Turf with Violets glows  And Birds 'mid purple Fragrance sing  When lo a Form divine appears  Advancing from a Laure Gloom  With all the rev'rend Marks of Years  With all the Pomp of  Greece  and  Rome  His solemn Port sublime displays  Each publick Worth each letter'd Grace  His sacred Head was crown'd with Bays  And Virtue triumph'd in his Face  A pious Fear fill'd all my Mind  As on the godlike Seer I gaz'd  To Ecstacy and Awe resign'd  I lay transported and amaz'd  The Muses all around him smile  Each Nymph sustains a golden Lyre  The Guardian Genius of this Isle  Sedate attends the sacred Sire  The Shape etherial nearer drew  In awful Dignity array'd  His Country's Father soon I knew  The  Drapier  's everhonour'd Shade  Th'illustrious Bard approach'd serene  Inclining gracious erc he spoke  Propitious Smiles adorn his Mien  And from his Lips these Accents broke  "To thee ev'n thee my Care extends  He said and reach'd his rev'rend Hand  "To plume thy Muse lo  Swift  descends  "To guide thy Flight thy Fame expand  "Let Virtue's Pow'r thy Strains employ  "Thy Country's Friends be always thine  "Her faithful Sons still sing with Joy  "And make the Patriot's Merit shine  "High as thy native Tow'rs upraise  "'Midst yonder Clouds their Tops sublime  "His Virtues soar who wakes thy Lays  "Inspires thy Muse demands thy Rhyme  "Not  Athens  ' Walls more worth could boast  "Tho'  Plato  there imbib'd his Lore  "Tho'  Tully  thence to  Latium  's Coast  "Transferr'd the bright immortal Store  "A shining Sage see  Boyne  disclose  "Who pours abroad bright Wisdom's Beams  "From his rich Tongue Persuasion flows  "And Science sheds her lucid Streams  "Through distant Climes his Fame outspread  "In wide expanding Rounds prevails  "He stands in lost  Astrea  's Stead  "To poize aloft th' unerring Scales  "A Worth like his my Lyre might praise  "Which Flatt'ry's Finger ne'er debas'd  "Such splendid Worth inspir'd my Lays  "When  Singleton  my Numbers grac'd"  That honour'd Sound my Senses shook  Sudden th' instructive Vision fled  Repos'd on  Swift  's inspiring Book  I waking found my raptur'd Head  On Mr  POPE's  Death  THESE Lines to  Pope  for ever sacred live  The best a grateful mourning Muse can give  To him now number'd with th' immortal Dead  This Verse unfeign'd with flowing Eyes be read  O Thou applauded by the Wise and Great  Nor Worth nor Genius could postpone thy Fate  Too long an Exile from the Worlds of Bliss  By envying Angels snatch'd too soon from this  Thy Strains seraphick shall their Anthems raise  Give Heav'n new Harmony and God new Praise  On a  PICTURE  of Our Saviour's Examination before  Caiphas  sent to his Grace Dr  GEORGE STONE  Lord Primate of  Ireland  ON hallow'd Canvass see the Saviour shine  And lowliest Meekness temper Beams divine  Unclouded Sapience in his Visage glows  And from his Eyes benign Effulgence flows  Resign'd and calm the World's Redeemer stands  And bears with godlike Patience impious Bands  The  Hebrew  Priest beholds that Face with Fear  And  Pilate  's Heart confess'd a God was there  No dread like this disturbs our Pontiff's Soul  No conscious Fears his rising Joys controul  Wrapt in the Theme divine his Bosom swells  And on the sacred Scene delighted dwells  What pure Emotions his warm Soul expand  When  Jesus  stretches his appealing Hand  The spotless Victim selfdevoted dies  Whilst Angels waft th'eternal Sacrifice  The glorious Groupe elates his raptur'd Mind  By Faith inflam'd and Love of Humankind  Hail pious Pastor thine's th' exalted Rock  The Crook is thine and thine the sacred Flock  O'er barren Cliffs thy watchful Care extends  On sunburn'd Heaths the naked Fold defends  Beneath thy genial Eye new Flow'rs shall grow  From gushing Rocks the limpid Springs shall flow  Ten thousand Hills see crown'd with rich Increase  Through vocal Vales the Lambs shall sport in Peace  Repuls'd by thee the Wolf shall prowl in vain  Nor shall the wily Fox infest the Plain  No more misled the wand'ring Flock shall stray  To ambush'd Snares and erring Guides a Prey  Within one widening Pale th' increasing Sheep  Unharm'd shall feed by Day secure by Night shail sleep  To Doctor  GREEN  THE arduous Task Infection to defeat  Be thine the Heartcorroding Pang remove  And chearful Health to drooping Life restore  From all the Channels of the vital Stream  Successful drive the lurking Mischief forth  By salutary Draught or various Skill  By  Esculapius  taught with sov'reign Pow'r  To calm the Tempest of the raging Blood  When dark seditious Vapours from the Lake  Of Life ascend to blot bright Reason's Ray  And dim the Eye of Thought when wild Uproar  Confounds the intellectual Frame and all  The raging Anarchy of Soul prevails  How dismal then the Chaos of the Mind  Each broken Sentiment and shatter'd Thought  The fractur'd Phraze unhing'd and all the Wreck  Of thinking Pow'r Can of immortal Minds  The Offspring Thought with noxious Fluids blend  And tinge Ideas in the tainted Mass  So closely ty'd is the connubial Knot

Pride of Nature and Creation's boast  To you Philosophy enamour'd flies  And triumphs in the Plaudit of your Eyes  When Worth like yours her shining Throne sustains  The Queen of Science with true Splendor reigns  By Beauty aided she extends her Sway  And won by you Mankind glad Homage pay  On the vain Pursuits and imperfect Enjoyments of  HUMAN LIFE  LIFE like a Plaything humours us awhile  We prize the Bauble at its Trinkets smile  Each glitt'ring Trifle stills us for a Day  Then Childrenlike we throw that Toy away  With froward Minds we long for something new  And still a vain Variety pursue  The distant Object which we covet most  If once enjoy'd is in Possession lost  Those Hills from far with seeming Verdure crown'd  A closer View has bleak and barren found  Led on by Hope we tread the Fairy Maze  And eager grasp at something still to please  A dearbought Wisdom Disappointment shews  In Life's blank Lott'ry all may fear to lose  The Miser anxious for his hoarded Gold  Starves in Abundance and in Want grows old  With squeezing Palm he gripes his Mammon fast  And clinches closer as he breathes his last  For Strangers hoards his Piles of mouldy Pelf  Who soon shall waste what he denies himself  Penurious Madman anxious for his Heap  Lab'ring to sow what other Hands must reap  By Midnight Lamps the poring Sage has past  His painful Life and is deceiv'd at last  Huge Volumes from his teeming Thoughts he draws  Imagin'd Monuments of vast Applause  Which shall to distant Years transmit him down  And teach Posterity his great Renown  Pleas'd with the Prospect he resigns his Breath  And fondly triumphs over Time and Death  When lo his Works an useless Lumber rot  And are with him in half an Age forgot  Through Foes for Fame the Soldier hews his Way  Provoking Fate and Fame shall be his Pay  For this young  Ammon  seeks to scale the Skies  And frantic  Charles  impartial Fate defies  'Twas this made Heroes in all Ages bleed  That Men unborn might envy every Deed  Deluded Mortals labour oft in vain  By Death prevented ere they count their Gain  What Gain alas can be expected here  Where all Things fail and nothing's found sincere  Yet human Vanity asserts her Claim  And courts an empty Echo for a Name  This Passion prone to lowest Ranks descends  The coarsest Clown for clumsey Fame contends  Ambition ebbing to its Vulgar Lee  Ferments in Dregs and warms each base Degree  Since Life's Enjoyments weigh not half its ill  And nothing here the human Soul can fill  To distant Objects she must turn her Eye  And present Wants by future Hopes supply  Such Hopes well grounded speak her truly wise  And lift her Wishes to their native Skies  Above the Reach of Rumour's feeble Sounds  And Fame that circles in surviving Rounds  To grasp at Happiness is all our View  Through diff'rent Tracks her Footsteps we pursue  Whilst each his own fallacious Path approves  As Int'rest leads or Inclination moves  Yet most through Error lose their wish'dfor Way  Who sets out wrong must wander far astray  Some plung'd in Riot seek their sov'reign Good  From tilting Spirits and tumultuous Blood  With large Potations Reason's Voice depress  And drown her Clamours in the deep Excess  'Midst reeking Fumes exhale their Lives away  Whilst late Repentance and a swift Decay  Pursuing close at Pleasure's lawless Heels  Bring all the Woes despairing Frenzy feels  When Lungs decay'd and Nerves convulsive shake  Each pungent Pang confirms the mad Mistake  Reflection then on Reason's Aid shall call  Bid Prudence prop what Folly dooms to fall  In vain much Wealth for Happiness we try  Soft Pleasures pall and soon as tasted die  Ambition giddy on its Summit grows  And Crowns sit heavy on the Monarch's Brows  Our Knowledge too in narrow Bounds confin'd  Defrauds our Hopes and disappoints the Mind  Lo all Enjoyments are imperfect here  And Pleasure's Cup is ever mix'd with Care  Since all Conditions their own Wants proclaim  Is then this Happiness an empty Name  A meer Delusion in our warm Embrace  A flitting Phantom which we fondly chace  Can nothing here the eager Mind sustain  Is Health a Shadow or is Virtue vain  The one in Absence we too late regard  The other fails nor is its own Reward  Continu'd Health's true Value's seldom known  And Virtue's strangely out of Fashion grown  As they who sail by  India  's fragrant Shore  Relax their Speed and ev'ry Gale devour  Bask in the Breezes breath'd from Spicey Lands  Yet sound the Rocks and shun the shelving Sands  To their intended Coast they slowly steer  Enjoy the Passage but not anchor there  So we through Life with calm Content should roam  Endure the Journey not mistake our Home  What here we reap is for Refreshment given  Convenient Stages in our Way to Heav'n  What Taste of Happiness we find below  Must from Religion's sacred Fountain flow  When gentle Passions move obedient still  And Reason rules and Wisdom guides the Will  This Soulfelt Calm can ev'ry Ill remove

the Breath of  May  When Fv'ning Gales o'er Beds of Roses play  She gently moves and with her moves a Band  Three smiling Graces at her guiding Hand  Delightful Babes whose lovely Faces show  The Morn's Vermilion and the Noontide Glow  Whose blooming Spring a Mother's Hope employs  Her Pledge and Promise of maturer Joys  Like tender Vines whose Blossoms deck the Year  Ere Boughs extend or rip'ning Fruits appear  Th' indulgent Warmth her genial Power supplies  And bids the future Fragrance fill the Skies  With her two Nymphs in letter'd League combin'd  Of virtuous Sentiment and Taste refin'd  Sisters in Science join'd and polish'd Ease  And each bright Talent to improve or please  External Beauty seems their smallest Share  Tho' none more lovely and tho' few so fair  Yet Strength

same  No Slave to Prejudice no Fool to Fame  Your stedfast Principles the Test abide  Spurn at Corruption or Ambition's Pride  True to your Country to your King sincere  Detesting Flatt'ry and contemning Fear  Scorning to swim down Faction's headlong Flood  A Patriot only for the publick Good  In Worth accomplish'd and to Truth resign'd  Humane to Failings and to Merit kind  Such were the Virtues such their high Degree  Which from bright Ancestors beam down on Thee  Yet shin'st thou not with mere imputed Rays  The faint Reflection of a borrow'd Blaze  Each envy'd Dignity you make more known  Bright'ning their Lustre as you spread your own  No Gleam shall sink in Time's devouring Gloom  They'll gild Oblivion and survive the Tomb  When falling Monuments their Trust betray  And Marbles moulder like their Dust away  When Nature's Frame a dreadful Ruin lies  And all her Beauty all her Order dies  Immortal Virtue shall transcend her Date  Look down on Death and triumph over

Dr  DELANY  A Youth whom Folly long had led aside  Was bless'd with Reason but o'errun with Pride  His Mind with Judgment and with Sense was fraught  Piercing his Wit sagacious was his Thought  By Nature fitted to discern aright  Whilst Science sharpen'd and improv'd his Sight  But lost to Virtue in his early Way  He walk'd the Path which led him wide astray  An ill Example his strong Passion sways  The foul Infection on his Morals preys  Religion mock'd he daily hears and sees  Endures it first then likes it by Degrees  Till with the potent Poison all o'erspread  His Conscience slumbers and his Fears are fled  Now plung'd in Vice he feels no Pang within  But sports with Death and basks secure in Sin  With horrid Blasphemies is nightly pleas'd  A dying Saviour and a God appeas'd  Are Subjects made for shocking Ridicule  When Wit runs wanton in the mad Misrule  Religion fled had left no feeble Trace  Nor in his Heart remain'd one Mark of Grace  Perverse forlorn O Death he's wholly thine  A rip'ning Victim to the Wrath Divine  The angry Bolt in Heaven's right Hand grows red  And aims Destruction at his guilty Head  When gracious Providence with Smile serene  Bade melting Mercy gently step between  Some Angel guides him with celestial Care  And leads him heedless to the House of Pray'r  Where haply  Paulus  in fair Truth's Defence  His Armour Reason and his Weapon Sense  Awful arose and with persuasive Art  Displays the Preacher's and th' Apostle's Part  Destin'd the harden'd Sinner to subdue  His Words resistless as his Cause was true  The list'ning Youth with conscious Tremblings heard  The mighty Truths his powerful Tongue declar'd  Alternate Changes in his Face arise  The Crimson Blush in sudden Paleness dies  He stands amaz'd his Eyes with Horror roll  Conviction flashes on his inmost Soul  Now Hope and Fear are in his Heart at Strife  Eternal Torments and eternal Life  Ideas fearful in his Mind renew  And open dreadful to his anxious View  His frozen Heart to Faith's warm Beam gives Way  Like Snow dissolving in the Noontide Ray  And from his Eyes repentant Drops distil  Like hallow'd Dew on  Hermon  's sacred Hill  Virtue and Truth resume their native Place  And Vice and Error now resign to Grace  Convinc'd subdu'd the yielding Convert stands  And lifts on high his supplicating Hands  The humbl'd Penitent low bends to God  And thanks the Hand which held the healing Rod  This straying Lamb whom Error long misled  Now sacred Shepherd in thy Fold is fed  Restor'd to taste with thy welltended few  The living Fountain and the fragrant Dew  A greater Triumph in his Change is won  Than  Julius  earn'd or  Philip  's haughty Son  Not  Indian  Treasures yield so bright a Crown  Not conquer'd Worlds can claim such true Renown  Go on admir'd thy heavenly Power employ  Give Sinners Comfort and give Angels Joy  Be still ambitious of such glorious Fame  And add new Trophies to thy Rev'rend Name  An  ESSAY  on the  WEAKNESS  of  HUMAN KNOWLEDGE  and the Uncertainty of mortal Life  OF Truths involv'd we vainly boast to know  Or Secrets sunk in Nature's Womb too low  Where our short Sight affords a feeble Gleam  Like flitting Visions in some wand'ring Dream  There wrapt in Mazes of Uncertainty  Suspending Reason doubts her own Decree  Discerns her Weakness must her Search confine  Too dim her Opticks and too short her Line  To fathom Depths that in thick Darkness lie  And sink impervious to the mental Eye  A Thousand Things correct our wanton Pride  And Doubts on Doubts arise on ev'ry Side  What are the universal Fabrick's Laws  Or if Attraction be th' immediate Cause  That knits the Springs of the revolving Sphere  Excites its Movements makes its Parts cohere  Through yonder Arch a trackless Space explore  Or mark the Waves on this resounding Shore  What guides the Stars in their stupendous Course  Through complex Motion and contending Force  How ebbing Seas from shelving Shores subside  Or circling  Cynthia  swells the foaming Tide  What Doors pour forth the furious  Northern  Blast  Or bitter Breezes from the chilling  East  Whence sudden Tempests toss the boistr'ous Deep  Or Storms are hush'd and on its Surface sleep  How rending Earthquakes make the Mountains rock  And shrinking Nature feels the dreadful Shock  Of Gravity the latent Cause reveal  Why mounts the Smoke or sinks the show'ry Hail  How flows the Vein in yonder rocky Rill  Or flash the Sparkles from the stubborn Steel  What Instinct moves the parsimon'ous Ant  Or dictates to th' unwieldy Elephant  How Mind and Matter strike such Harmony  And Will and Motion in one Form agree  Whence dawn Ideas Whence Perception's Ray  Whence gleams the Soul with intellectual Day  Th'internal Essence of one Atom show  Then boast of Science and how much you know  Here glimm'ring Reason lights our dubious Way  This Twilight State forbids a brighter Day  Through Nature's Mist lo Truth appears from far  To few a fix'd to more a wand'ring Star  Their Pole indeed who sail by Wisdom's Shore  But lost to those who distant Depths explore  Whose Rays illusive oft our Sight misguide  And lessen here what there they magnify'd  Our Judgments vary as our Passions bend  Caprice the  Motive  and Selflove the  End  Opinion's tinctur'd with Complexion's Stains  The mottley Issue of discordant Brains  When form'd by Fancy in Affection's Dress  Their diff'ring Sires in diff'rent Shapes express  From hence the fierce Polemick Hydra came  From hence this System and that Sect took Name  Hence  Epicurus  made his Atoms dance  And hence  Descartes  thy Physical Romance  From hence Religion felt the wild Extremes  The Bigot Fury and Enthusiast's Dreams  By dim Conjectures we indulge our Pride  Such doubtful Knowledge is a dang'rous Guide  The winking Glimmer will our Hopes deceive  Like dying Lamps in some perplexing Cave  It lights us in while we with Wonder gaze  But soon extinguish'd in the gloomy Maze  Bewilder'd where the Lamp no more can burn  We lose our Labour and too late return  Our prying Eyes would pierce all Nature's Store  Unlock her Secrets turn her Treasures o'er  Yet far within she shuns the searching Ray  Her mighty Master keeps the mystick Key  A nearer View's deny'd to mortal Sight  Newton'  s transcendent Day must bound in Night  Well did eternal Providence ordain  In Life's short View to make the Prospect plain  Where Man may answer Nature's wholesome Call  Enjoy himself and seek the Good of All  Where known Effects result from stated Laws  And loud proclaim the one Eternal Cause  The Source from whence the vast Creation flows  The Mind from which ten thousand Systems rose  For these wise Ends our Faculties were made  And God we see through all his Works display'd  Beyond this Limit Man may spare his Pains  Nor waste the Vigour of his lab'ring Brains  In quest of Truths remote from human Sight  Which 'scape our Ken and mock'd the  Stagyrite  The smallest Worm insults the Sage's Hand  All  Gresham  's vanquish'd by a Grain of Sand  The stinted Lot allow'd to Human Race  The narrow Bounds of our contracted Space  Can scarce our Minds with useful Thoughts supply  Like Afterfruits we just appear and die  Vain Searches here our Levity proclaim  By Tempests toss'd who takes a steady Aim  When Waves are dashing round the driven Bark  The Pilot's Danger mocks his nice Remark  Who would improve that knows no Term to come  Or purchase Diamonds to adorn a Tomb  By poor Endeavours we solicit Praise  An empty Idol which to Pride we raise  A frail Defence to shield our Names from Death  A fulsome Vapour made of vulgar Breath  Tis Virtue lengthens out our mortal Span  Immortal Fame shall crown the virtuous Man  Religion's Eye can soften human Fate  Whilst Hope from far beholds a better State  If long or short it matters not our Stay  While Reason smooths and Peace prepares the Way  This irksome Desart must be travell'd through  Ere  Pisgah  's Top or  Canaan  's Vales we view  Men glide like Bubbles on the Stream of Time  Burst as they swell and vanish in their Prime  Or floating down the universal Tide  Encount'ring join and in the Shock subside  Since God and Nature some wise Purpose plan  In all this lower World but most in Man  A Creature fram'd at such a vast Expence  Enrich'd with Reason and adorn'd with Sense  Why would its Maker's Hand so close confine  To clogging Clay this Particle Divine  Which outward Casualties can still annoy  And whose own Motion must itself destroy  When fullblown Faculties his Genius crown  Lo Death assails and lops the Pigmy down  Why all this Labour on a Thing that must  As soon as finish'd fall again to Dust  Thus reasons Man whose Reas'nings oft are vain  And sees so little of th' eternal Chain  From whence contingent Destinies impend  A Scale of Causes that in God must end  The mystick Mazes of his own Decree  In Wonders wrapt which He alone can see  Yet Man vile Reptile with Presumption pryes  Where trembling Angels veil their wond'ring Eyes  Imperious Emmet know thy native Dust  Thyself mistaken and thy Maker just  Who gives thee Rudiments of Knowledge here  Then lifts thee upwards to a nobler Sphere  Above the Stars to take thy high Degree  And brighten on to all Eternity  Where Truth still shining in unclouded Day  Shall all her Radiance on thy Soul display  Forbear vain Man to murmur at thy Fate  Nor mourn thy Passage to a better State  Tho' Nature binds thee to this sordid Spot  Break from her Bands and seek a happier Lot  To God alone let thy Affections tend  Thy proper Center and thy final End  Who out of nothing made the World and thee  His Wisdom form'd and Goodness bid it be  Eternal Wisdom whilst yet all was Night  Call'd forth from Chaos his first Creature Light  And spread its Splendor o'er the wide Expanse  Where Orbs unnumber'd move in mystick Dance  Then smil'd Omnipotence his Works to see  He smil'd in Light and bid that Lamp still be  Now blaz'd the Sun in his bright Orb above  The Morning Stars in joyful Measures move  The list'ning Angels in deep Wonder gaze  Then join'd the Hymn and their first Work was Praise  To the Hon Mrs  CONOLLY  HOW pious Worth exalted Rank endears  What lovely Grandeur Virtue lends to Years  What Dignity humane what awful Grace  Dwell in that Mien and open in that Face  A Mind thus bless'd shall eye the last slow Sand  When tardy Time uplifts his lenient Hand  With dauntless Joy the untry'd State explore  Quit Nature's Limits and with Seraphs soar  Why else would Piety her Palm display  Why else invite us to the Realms of Day  Sure Heav'n had made the Christian Task too hard  If Goodness here could claim no just Reward  If Faith farseeing found no chearing Gleam  Nor Ev'ning Hope enjoy'd the Morning Beam  Lo dawning Glories gild this Vale of Strife  And Heav'n's own Lamp illumes the Bounds of Life  Sedate from thence thy tranquil Eye now cast  On future Pleasures and enjoy the past  Pleasures sublime and pure still genuine glow  Which only Hearts like thine can ever know  Where ev'ry Virtue in warm League combin'd  Are treasur'd up in Store for Humankind  Thence flowing daily through thy gen'rous Hand  Relieve all Care and glad a grateful Land  For thee incessant breathes the Heartfelt Pray'r  The Wish unfeigned and the Vow sincere  For thee the Widow lifts her tearless Eyes  For thee the Orphan's Incense mounts the Skies  The publick Voice for thee still fervent prays  And begs each Blessing from thy length of Days  Long here to flourish long thy Pow'r dispense  Ere Heav'n shall call and Angels waft thee hence  Take then the Plaudit to thy Merit due  The Crown unfading and the Triumph true  How vain the tinsel Pomp which Monarchs claim  The Blaze of Grandeur and the Blast of Fame  Those useless Trappings of external State  'Tis Wisdom shines 'tis Virtue makes them great  Such virtuous Wisdom as adorns thy Mind  By Hope exalted and by Faith refin'd  With grateful Fervours must that Bosom swell  Where pious Confidence and Meekness dwell  The Soul firm settled and the Thought serene  The Part well acted and the closing Scene  Appear triumphant to th' exulting Eye  Ere Angels draw the Curtain of the Sky  'Tis thine the Debt of Nature thus to pay  And close the Ev'ning of thy splendid Day  Thine with Applause to quit the mortal Stage  Thy Part a Pattern for each future Age  To teach Posterity the Track Divine  And point th' immortal Path which once was thine  To the Reverend Dr  Mann  occasioned by the  Author  's asking him for a Subject to write on and his saying he could think of none  IS ev'ry moral Subject found so trite  Has wholsome Satire nothing new to write  No Vice to lash no Folly to expose  Shall happier Pulpits do the Work in Prose  Shall they reclaim the erring Sons of Men  And Preachers Tongues supplant the Poet's Pen  Shall distant Fears reform flagitious Times  Nor present Shame give Sanction to my Rhimes  How much would Breeding and Politeness fail  Should Wits be frighted at a formal Tale  Clear Truths in such a Garb would give Offence  What think to scar with Bugbears Men of Sense  Thank Heaven they bid these Monkish Dreams good Night  The Clouds are gone and all again looks bright  Such Sentiments there are such Humours spread  Their noxious Poison through the Heart and Head  What learned Cure can Doctors here advise  Since Fools extol what wiser Knaves despise  An odd Experiment for once be try'd  Inlist a Poet on Religion's Side  Let Verse with all her youthful Train appear  And Wit to Virtue serve a Volunteer  At her own Weapons foil the dext'rous Foe  And shoot down Folly with her fav'rite Bow  Deck'd in bright Arms let Reason gaily tread  First win the Fancy then surprize the Head  Since Truth must like a pelted Pillar stand  The Butt and Aim of each fantastick Hand  That sacred Pile whose Rock eternal bears  The Rage of hostile Storms and sapping Years  In vain the Floods assault its stedfast Base  In vain would Hell its heav'nly Form deface  Tho' eighteen rolling Ages loud proclaim  Its Strength unshaken and its Height the same  Tho' half the Kings who rule this pendent Ball  Bow down their Scepters and before it fall  Against it Knaves their impious Force will try  And mimick Fools their feeble Bolts let fly  Say then my Friend from whence this Humour springs  This bloated Vice this angry Form of Things  Whose inbred Venom stirs such tumid Rage  The Bane and Brand of this licentious Age  Shall not the Muse the hidden Cause disclose  Probe the proud Part the putrid Plague expose  Regardless she who feels the pungent Smart  The Head misguided or the highblown Heart  If Priest or People most in Fault she finds  If Pride oppresses or if Envy blinds  To both alike impartial she proceeds  And forms her Estimate of Men by Deeds  Say first Why rolls the Force of Fashion's Tide  So smoothly swift against Religion's Side  Whilst down its Stream the Men of Power throng  The Men of Pleasure and the Men of Song  Drawn by the artful  Lord  Shaftsbury  Peer's seducing Lore  Join the gay Crowd and seek th' enchanting Shore  There the abandon'd headlong and prophane  With Pride press forwards and of Priests complain  Bright as the Beams that from the Ocean rise  When radiant Rays adorn the Eastern Skies  Fair as the Essence of Etherial Light  Dawning o'er Chaos and coeval Night  Pure as the Gale that from  Arabia  blows  Than Lillies whiter or than falling Snows  Religion shone when first the Heavenborn Maid  With Virgin Truth and Purity array'd  Sublimely meek disclos'd her Angel Face  Beaming celestial Smiles and shedding Grace  Her suff'ring Sons the scourging Rod sustain  Their Province Patience and their Portion Pain  No Pomp they seek no pageant Pow'r they need  Ambitious only for her Sake to bleed  In Meekness rob'd thus humble was her State  "She knew no Wish so mean as to be great"  On Heav'n alone she fix'd her stedfast Eye  Her Master's Kingdom was beyond the Sky  She sought not Wealth unanxious of her Store  For his Example taught her to be poor  Thus in her blooming Years oppress'd she grew  By Patience arm'd the Mighty to subdue  How mild her Mien how winning then her Ways  How diff'rent from her Looks in later Days  The Muse would spare what fullen Truth may blame  Nor dwells delighted on so harsh a Theme  Truth like the genial Sun will still abide  Tho' Vapours veil it and the Clouds may hide  Could prying Malice or could Envy see  Religion leaning in the least Degree  To fetter Freedom or bright Reason blind  Or throw a tangling Snare on Humankind  Could one Ingredient in that pure Compound  To Parts pernicious or the Whole be found  The Fool of Wit with some Pretence might fleer  The Coxcomb rally and the Pedant sneer  Smart  Virro  frankly owns it makes him grieve  To see the floating Robe and swelling Sleeve  The Chin high bolster'd and the florid Face  Are mighty Marks of Wisdom and of Grace  Pert in the wrong and seldom right in Season  Too much in Haste to hear or offer Reason  At Creeds he mocks how loud the Laughing Fit  How willing to be damn'd to shew his Wit  Sporus  forsooth allows some pious Cheats  But then such clumsey Bugbears gross Deceits  Such Monkish Phantoms make the Juggle clear  To Men of Sense the Thing will still appear  Such Arts indeed may Vulgar Minds restrain  And graver Fools who like may hug the Chain  To talk of Fasting Furity and Grace  With all that Sanctity and Form of Face  Which pamper'd Priests o'er Velvet Cushions wear  Would make a Hermit smile a Stoick stare  When they aloft hold forth the Cake and Rod  And point to Paths which  Paul  and  Peter  trod  To narrow Paths they point and thorny Ways  And those who like may tread them if they please  Far other Objects their Affections fix  In Stalls to snore or in a Coach and six  Meer Censure is at best a poor Pretence  And Malice ill supplies the Place of Sense  Reproach so keen when vulgar found and trite  Shows less of Candour than of partial Spight  Since Pride in all and Passions still abound  Since few are Proof and none are perfect found  To Nature's Slips be kind Allowance made  And o'er her Failings cast a friendly Shade  Tho' Priests indeed should good Examples give  Yet Priests have Appetites and Priests must live  "But why such Wealth and Grandeur Why so great  "Like Lords attended and like Kings they eat"  This more betrays the Rancour of your Will  You'd have the Clergy barefoot Beggars still  Still homeless wander through the World opprest  Without Protection or a Place of Rest  The Wealth they have was by the State bestow'd  Or rather paid them as a Debt it ow'd  For Shame no more such bitter Railings bring  You Quarrel with the Men and not the Thing  O'er Vices watchful and to Virtues blind  By Nature prone to Prejudice inclin'd  With sharpen'd Sight each human Spot to spy  On shining Worth to shut th' indignant Eye  Shall groping Pride in Error's Twilight stray  While Truth directs and Wisdom points her Way  Selfwilder'd still the glorious Lamp evade  And seek with purblind Orbs the sullen Shade  If Goodness charms if Learning's Palm you prize  To  Boulter  bow to  Berkeley  lift your Eyes  If publick Virtue for Esteem may call  Behold his Country's Pride in mitred  Maul  Lord Bishop of  Meath    Diffusing Truth on pious Plans to raise  Her present Hope her Joy in future Days  Sacred to her his upright Life he spends  Her winning Charms displays her Cause defends  Thee rev'rend Patriot thee the Muse should sing  And rise exulting on thy  Clio's  Wing  In Verse like thine recording Numbers raise  And Deeds unequal'd sing with lasting Praise  See Science shine see publick Virtue bloom  See Arts advance to rival  Greece  and  Rome  No more the steril Glebe shall stint the Swain  See barren Mountains crown'd with golden Grain  The staple Web employs th'industrious Hand  For  Madden  bids and Wealth o'erflows the Land  Who dare such Worth with venom'd Tongue invade  Yet these are Priests and this their daily Trade  Nor Prelates only shall the Muse inspire  Lo Ranks subordinate her Strains require  A shining Throng whom raging Vice must spare  Mild Virtue honour and calm Sense revere  Exalted Minds that would Perfection reach  Still living Lessons of the Truths they teach  Whose Practice proves the Precept pure display'd  Whose Words illustrate and whose Lives perswade  Whose blameless Breasts th'invidious World might scan  From Vice as distant as thy Mind O  Mann    Where Meekness thron'd her pious Scepter sways  And Virtue's Pow'r commands these feeble Lays  Long long esteem'd with thy lov'd  Lelius  shine  And give me leave for once to call him mine  O could my Verse to distant Years declare  The grateful Heart the Sentiment sincere  Which ill in Words and worse in Deeds I tell  Felt only in that Bosom where they swell  Then should this Strain on Time's last Period tend  Worthy so bright a Guide so good a Friend  To a Person of fine Parts but whimsical Humours of a cruel Nature and bad Morals  WHY would wild Nature with her Bounty play  And throw such Treasures of her Charms away  With wasteful Hand why lavish half her Store  Enriching one while she left Thousands poor  Or squander Blessings on a stubborn Land  That ill requites the chearful Giver's Hand  The surly Glebe a mingl'd Product shows  The hateful Hemlock and the fragrant Rose  Shoot up promiscuous in our wond'ring Sight  And give at once both Horror and Delight  Bright Sparks of Diamond glitter through coarse Mold  And vulgar Dross deforms the ductile Gold  Lo Nature there and Providence proclaim  The strongest Contrast in the last Extream  Where good and bad lie mingl'd and confus'd  A shocking Discord in a Breast abus'd  When calm the Clime O how serene the while  Yet Storms lie brooding in a Winter's Smile  The fell  Hyena  can the Shepherd call  With human Voice design'd his Prey to fall  That Heav'n should thus a reas'ning Being arm  With seeming Virtue and with ev'ry Charm  Which Wit and Genius in their Prime bestow  To gild Deceit and give a treach'rous Blow  Such fickle Blandishments too oft betray  The faint Reflection of a dying Ray  A feeble Flash which earthy Vapours form  The Smile of Wrath as Lightning gilds a Storm  No lasting Lustre's in its fading Mien  An  ignis fatuus  when'tis brightest seen  Could thy good Genius in the Strife prevail  When Destiny held up the doubtful Scale  A finish'd Mortal had in thee appear'd  By all admired and by all rever'd  But then alas some unpropitious Pow'r  Infus'd Malignance on thy natal Hour  For when thy Soul did  Jove  's own Hand employ  It dash'd thy Essence with some curst Alloy  Which took th'Impression of each baleful Ill  In crooked Traces and retains them still  Thy injur'd Virtues in some weak Essays  Like tender Blades their blooming Heads would raise  But soon the stronger Cockle choaks the Grain  And stifl'd Goodness lifts itself in vain  A Fancy flowing an Expression fit  Invention bless'd in ev'ry Charm of Wit  With Humour envy'd for its Turn of Ease  And Talents happy in the Art to please  All these you have by Fate's uncommon Grant  Yet solid Excellence alas you want  Fair Justice Chastity from you are thrust  Drove out by Cruelty Revenge and Lust  While proud Oppression base Distrust and Fear  The Coward's Bugbear and the Tyrant's Snare  Contend alternate in your stormy Breast  And rob your Tempestbeaten Soul of Rest  Huge Midnight Horrors by dark Vapours wrought  Hang o'er your Slumbers and torment your Thought  Confus'd Ideas in your Fancy roll  The jumbling Chaos of a Brainsick Soul  'Tis this wild Medium shews you wrong and right  A Friend at Noon becomes your Foe at Night  Those little Slips where Nature's Self must halt  A Molehill Trip you make a Mountain Fault  Deluded by a dark distemper'd Mind  You form an Estimate of all Mankind  Each frightful Phantom which you there descry  You dread in all Men and to all apply  The monstrous Shadows in your Mind still roam  You judge abroad from what you find at home  Your Friendship flashes like an  April  Sun  A Moment's Glimmer in a Moment gone  Strange Groupes of Whimsies your wild Fancy frames  Like Bedlam Pictures or a Sick Man's Dreams  A WeatherCock obedient to each Gale  One single Blast can turn your Head and Tail  You're fix'd indeed in Malice and Disgust  So stands your lofty Emblem

Nature shines through all  Here mossy Mounds impending seem to swell  That from their Veins effuse the gushing Rill  The Rill o'er spangling Pebbles seems to glide  With Shells of Amber glitt'ring at its Side  That mid the Gloom reflect a Silver Ray  As Planets twinkle in the Dusk of Day  Angels' Ideas in thy Mind arose  And whisp'ring Graces taught thee to dispose  Nature's bright Mirrour in thy Bosom shone  And she with Blushes saw herself outdone  To you profuse she lavish'd all her Store  Of Matter freely but of Fancy more  Not all the Gems which  Indian  Mines prepare  Can with that Ruby

Scorning to whine out Grief in technick Strains  He sobs with Dignity with Sense complains  Thus  Hamlet  mourns and thus his Sorrow shines  In  Barry  's Action and in  Shakespear  's Lines  His pleasing Form gives ev'n to Anguish Grace  And Grief sits lovely on his suff'ring Face  But see his Father's warlike Shade stalks near  What quickrais'd Passions in his Soul appear  In Horror fix'd as Thunderstruck he stands  With starting Eyeballs and with outstretch'd Hands  Ten thousand Tumults struggling in his Breast  Each strong Attempt by stronger Fear supprest  His Reason sunk no guiding Gleams can chear  All is wild Anarchy and Chaos there  His lab'ring Words can yet no Passage find  Lost in the Floods and Whirlpools of his Mind  Till by Degrees her dawning Beam she shows  As first bright Order from Confusion rose  Returning Sense resumes her wonted Sway  And Courage prompts and Judgment points the Way  The horrid Silence now resolv'd he breaks  With eager Voice and supplicating speaks  Revenge provok'd has all his Mind possess'd  And fell Resentment boils within his Breast  His kindling Eyes with livid Lightnings roll  And dart the Purpose of his stedfast Soul  In Madness ev'n in that unpractis'd Task  The Part looks graceful and adorns the Mask  No sullen dark distemper'd Rage appears  'Tis Fancy's Frolick and her Caprice chears  Through ev'ry varying Scene great Nature warms  And finish'd Art improves her pleasing Charms  On the Death of a favourite Nightingale  THOU sweetest Warbler of the gladsome Spring  Whose trilling Musick charm'd th' attentive Ear  No more thy tuneful Throat shall joyful sing  An early Welcome to the Infant Year  No more alas shall thy inspiring Flow  Beguile the Moments of the Midnight Hour  What Time the Branches bend beneath the Snow  And Birds for Safety seek the shadeless Bow'r  Can I forget the Musick of thy Tongue  Which spread around such high harmonions Airs  When circling Measures in the Portal rung  And lofty Echo fill'd the sounding Stairs  When dappl'd  Cloe  from the Hearthstone gaz'd  The vanquish'd Linnet sadly silent stands  And little  George  himself look'd up amaz'd  The Soopdish shaking in his heedless Hands  When  Dublin Molly  busy in the Bar  With Wonder listen'd to his charming Lay  Then bless'd her happy Fate who came so far  To hear him sweetly sing from  Aston  's Quay  Nor could the Poet's Tongue his Praise forbear  Who often came to hear his Strains divine  And in his Cups would candidly declare  His Notes were sweeter than the tuneful Nine  Thus jovial danc'd the smiling Hours away  When  Philomela  gave such true Delight  Good Humour chear'd the short thickclouded Day  And Punch and Pleasure crown'd the livelong Night  But Fate alas forbade our growing Joys  What human Happiness can always last  Relentless Fate which ev'ry Life destroys  At  Philly  's Breast his lifted Jav'lin cast  Could no Delight his mortal Wrath asswage  Nor Musick's Pow'r his pointed Dart withstand  In vain alas  Clarinda  clean'd the Cage  In vain she fed him with her milkwhite Hand  How Gladness danc'd within his little Eyes  Still as he saw her decent Cap and Gown  As up the Steps she gently us'd to rise  And in his highhung House she took him down  How tenderly she stroak'd his Neck and Bill  How softly touch'd his taper Legs and Claws  With lenient Finger sooth'd each smarting Ill  And gently heal'd his little Hurts and Flaws  But thou fell Wretch that in the open Street  With savage Hand our frighted Songster struck  Mayst thou with screaming ScreechOwls nightly meet  With boding Batts with Bailiffs and bad Luck  May braying Asses Bitterns from the Mire  And croaking Ravens haunt thee all thy Life  May baleful Cats and cack'ling Hens conspire  And what's more dreadful still a scolding Wife  On a fine Crop of Peas being spoil'd by a Storm  WHen  Morrice  views his prostrate Peas  By raging Whirlwinds spread  He wrings his Hands and in amaze  He sadly shakes his Head  Is this the Fruit of my fond Toil  My Joy my Pride my Chear  Shall one tempestuous Hour thus spoil  The Labours of a Year  Oh what avails that Day by Day  I nurs'd the thriving Crop  And settl'd with my Foot the Clay  And rear'd the social Prop  Ambition's Pride had spur'd me on  All Gard'ners to excell  I often call'd them one by one  And boastingly would tell  How I prepar'd the furrow'd Ground  And how the Grain did sow  Then challeng'd all the Country round  For such an early Blow  How did their Bloom my Wishes raise  What Hopes did they afford  To earn my honour'd Master's Praise  And crown his chearful Board  Poor  Morrice  wrapt in sad Surprize  Demands in sober Mood  Should Storms molest a Man so wise  A Man so just and good  Ah  Morrice  cease thy fruitless Moan  Nor at Misfortunes spurn  Misfortune's not thy Lot alone  Each Neighbour has his Turn  Thy prostrate Peas which low recline  Beneath the Frowns of Fate  May teach much wiser Heads than thine  Their own uncertain State  The sprightly Youth in Beauty's Prime  The lovely Nymph so gay  Oft Victims fall to early Time  And in their Bloom decay  In vain th' indulgent Father's Care  In vain wise Precepts form  They droop like Peas in tainted Air  Or perish in a Storm  LESBIA  and her Sparrow Or  Cupid  turn'd Fowler  AS little  Cupid  blith and gay  Among the Roses flew  Brushing the Vi'lets in his Way  Impearl'd with Morning Dew  His painted Wings he wanton spread  To skim the daisi'd Lawn  Then perching on a Lilly's Head  Stood smiling in the Dawn  Young  Lesbia  now amid the Gales  The Breath of Morn bestows  Fan'd by the Fragrance which it steals  From Cowslips and the Rose  To yonder Grotto arch'd with Green  The lovely Nymph drew nigh  The warbling Thrush inchants the Scene  With Bees which humming fly  Now plac'd within the blissfu Shade  Her Sparrow flutt'ring round  Cupid  descries th' unguarded Maid  And meditates the Wound  His glitt'ring Bow he hasty bent  Then from his Quiver drew  The pointed Shaft he twanging sent  The Shaft which crring flew  To pierce her Breast he speeds the Dart  Yet Love himself shoots wide  His Arrow enter'd  Dickey  's Heart  He on her Bosom dy'd  Who would not envy his sweet Death  And  Dickey  's Doom desire  Within her Arms to yield his Breath  And on her Breast expire  To a young  LADY  on her performing upon the Harpsichord  THE Muse who sung thy dawning Praise  Now welcomes thy Meridian Rays  The Beauties of thy early Prime  First fledg'd her Wings for Flights sublime  She saw thee shine like op'ning Day  Along the Tracts of Heav'n's Highway  The Muse prophetick saw thee there  Still bright'ning in thy lucid Sphere  Now far unequal in her Flight  And lost in Beams of daz'ling Light  On raptur'd Wing she hails thy Noon  As soaring Eagles seek the Sun  But O what Numbers can she find  To sing the Beauties of thy Mind  Where ev'ry Virtue Heav'n bestows  And ev'ry Grace from Heav'n that flows  A hallow'd Treasure all combine  Within that spotless Ark divine  Which beaming forth so oft declare  That God vouchsafes to visit there  To deck thee with distinguish'd Love  He took from ev'ry Saint above  Ideas of the purest Kind  And mixing all compos'd thy Mind  Then lodg'd it in the fairest Mold  That should a Soul so rich infold  A Mold with fairest Forms to vie  In finish'd Shape and Symmetry  Harmonious to the ravish'd Sight  Inspiring Joy and soft Delight  Inchanting all to instant Love  Who hear thy Voice or see thee move  But when the tuneful Keys you press  And Musick's inmost Pow'rs express  What melting Strains extatick rise  How ev'ry raptur'd Hearer dies  See Love his purple Wings expand  And flutter o'er the snowy Hand  From ev'ry Finger flies a Dart  In e'ery Note he wounds a Heart  Whilst conscious Blushes still confess  Your kind Concern for our Distress  And yet by height'ning ev'ry Grace  The Pain they would relieve increase  For as in Paintings Shadows lie  To raise the Picture to the Eye  Thy Blushes thus but more reveal  The modest Worth they would conceal  To  CLOE  KIND Nature has  Cloe  express'd  To strike us with Joy and Surprize  Each Grace in her Form is confess'd  And  Cupids  exult in her Eyes  Her Form so erect fair and tall  Such winning Attraction displays  Her Mind the best Beauty of all  My Wish and Affections still raise  The Nightingale chimes to her Voice  The Syrens would yield to her Song  In Echos the Vallies rejoice  Her Musick inchants the gay Throng  Lo Summer has spangl'd the Vales  And Roses their Purple disclose  The Vi'lets enrich the soft Gales  And Harmony heightens all those  Since Beauty and Rapture agree  To ravish both Hearing and Sight  O come my deac  Cloe  with me  And crown the gay Scene with Delight  Come with me my Nymph to yon Grove  Where the Thrush and the Linnet resort  Whose Bowers invite us to Love  Where  Cupids  still revel and sport  In Bliss we'll enjoy the long Day  To mutual

the lonely Shore  Fix'd on a Rock her anxious Head she hung  With Hands uprais'd she smote her aking Breast  Britannia's  Coast her mournful Eyes explore  Her silent Harp neglected lay unstrung  Impatient she accus'd each tardy Gale  Which on longling'ring lazy Pinions flew  Each distant Cloud appear'd a rising Sail  Fraught with glad Tidings to her View  Of STANHOPE's Bosom freed from Pain  A grateful People's Triumph to restore  Then damp'd by Doubts she sighs and droops again  Th' imagin'd Joy alas appears no more  Each publick Virtue and each private Grace  Which warm'd the Patriot's Godlike Mind  His princely Wisdom and his Love of Peace  His gen'rous Care of Humankind  Awful arise within her grateful Soul  Alternate Passions in her Bosom roll  Now chearing Hopes prevail now sad'ning Fears  Now rise gay Smiles now fall desponding Tears  When lo a darting Glory blazing wide  us'd Effulgence of celestial Day  Eastern Sky with crimson Clouds was dy'd  quiv'ring Gleams gild all the wat'ry Way  When on a Throne which orient Beams upbore  Aloft  Britannia  's awful Genius smil'd  Three kingly Crowns of brilliant Gems he wore  And regal State compos'd his Aspect mild  Descending slowly on his Wings outspread  Now poiz'd majestick in th' etherial Space  The Pow'r propitious bows his sacred Head  His Words were utter'd with seraphick Grace  Banish thy Grief  Ierne

shall flow  And gushing Health expelling Pains  Shall daily give his Strength to grow  And lo like Morn new ris'n he springs  Propitious Health on Dovelike Wings  Flies hov'ring o'er his dawning Face  And with her brings Delight and Peace  Rekindling Joy each brilliant Orb supplies  And lights anew the Splendor of his Eyes  Too long their Beams in Clouds conceal'd  Lay hid from publick Sight  A

India's  Shore  Which flows enliv'ning in his Country's Veins  Still more the Publick's than his private Gains  So runs the sanguine Current through the Heart  Whilst ev'ry Member shares a wholesome Part  Would they who swell in higher Rank and Place  The Boast of Vice the Blush of Human Race  With virtuous Emulation wisely see  A People's Parent and that Parent thee  No more should Luxury licentious roam  To waste abroad the Wealth we want at home  No more should Wretchedness and Want prevail  Nor Hunger tempt the starving Hand to steal  Nor should Corruption with her gilded Claws  Debauch our Senates and debase the Laws  Each wealthy Chief would then a Patriot be  Who for his Country lives must live like thee  But see where Nature with distinguish'd Grace  Adorns the Prospect of this lovely Place  The Birds harmonious chaunt on every Tree  To welcome to their Groves the Spring and thee  There waving Woods on lofty Summits grow  Here Silver Lakes reflect their Shades below  The charming Landskip glads the Gazer's Heart  And Nature's Hand assists the Hand of Art  Yet Art alone behold triumphant smile  With all her Pomp in yonder sacred Pile  Whose solemn Brow the stedfast Eye commands  The pious Labour of religious Hands  Which rais'd to Heav'n in these degen'rate Days  It's Founder's Faith and Gratitude displays  And shall inform remotest Years to come  When  Brunswick  reign'd and  Cleon  rear'd the Dome  A noble Task lies immature behind  Tho' oft revolv'd within your gen'rous Mind  Yet still in Embrio waits your pow'rful Hand  To form the Symmetry and bid it stand  When Arches bend and swelling Columns rise  The stately Edifice shall strike our Eyes  With simple Majesty and solemn Stile  At once to deck and dignify the Pile  The noble Mass magnificent shall grow  Not vainly high nor yet ignobly low  Shall shine a Medium clear of each Excess  Its Master's Temper and his Worth express  Shall there erect in lasting Grandeur be  By Judges honour'd tho' 'twas sung be me  TEMPE  a  POEM  inscrib'd to  SOLITUDE  AT last I find where Health her Bow'r has made  To walk with Wisdom in the social Shade  Each Sister Virtue in her Train is seen  Rejoyc'd to wait on sweet Content their Queen  Around her Grott unfading Verdure grows  And Bliss untainted from her Fountain flows  By Nature call'd she quaffs the Morning Gale  And sups with Science in the Muse's Vale  Content and Nature in one Mansion dwell  And Virtue near them builds her mossy Cell  Happy the Man who seeks not Pow'r or Praise  And with such meek Associates spends his Days  From Envy safe and wild Ambition's Sway  No Camps allure him and no Courts betray  From Custom's Snares secure he turns aside  The Baits of Passion and the Springs of Pride  By Prudence taught he points his mental Ken  Through Wisdom's Glass and views the Ways of Men  Who grasp at fleeting Good in each Disguise  And gaze on Shadows with insatiate Eyes  With panting Hearts each false Delight pursue  Through Fancy's Maze but still neglect the true  By Pride impell'd in Fairy Rounds they roam  To seek that Bliss abroad which lives at home  Misguided Man to Passion's Pow'r a Prey  By Sense deceiv'd by Judgment led astray  Thou Tool of Folly in thy Reason's spight  Renounce thy Knowledge and do Nature right  Did she the splendid Ills of Life impose  Increase thy Wishes or create thy Woes  Did she thy Idol Pride advance on high  Or lift thy daring Thoughts to scale the Sky  Did she inchant thee in the mystick Glade  To build on Vapours and dissect a Shade  In fierce Opinion's Forge to toil in vain  And mould the Phantoms of thy forming Brain  For specter'd Whims which sanguine Fancy rears  Distort the Center and confound the Spheres  Did she the Bigot's furious Breast inspire  To spread his frantick Schemes with Sword and Fire  Of all who breathe in Earth in Air or Tides  Whom Reason governs or whom Instinct guides  Thro' Nature's Realms no Wretch like Man is found  Who spurns her Barriers and who breaks her Bound  Still rushing lawless on his headlong Mind  Leaves native Joy and gentle Peace behind  He spreads the Snares of Fate in Fashion's Loom  And in each deep Refinement digs his Tomb  Ye Sons of Folly hither bend your Eyes  Compare Conditions and for once be wise  Here Art adorns the smiling Groves and Fields  She rules o'er Nature and to Nature yields  With mutual Scepter and successive Sway  By Turns they govern and by Turns obey  Bright Order first and Truth coeval rose  To Error still and Discord endless Foes  Eternal Harmony through Nature sounds  Gives Brooks their Borders and gives Worlds their Bounds  Establish'd Rectitude in all appears  Instinct the Ant and Concord moves the Spheres  Why else should Extasy my Breast o'erflow  When icy Winters frown or Roses blow  When raging Storms the Mountain Billows break  Or gentlest Gales curl o'er the quiv'ring Lake  Here Twilight Groves my Ev'ning Fancy woo  The Rook high cawing while the Woodquests coo  The colour'd Cloud enrich'd with golden Dyes  To crown yon bluerob'd Hill which props the Skies  The winding Vale that spreads her mantl'd Bloom  The Lake that glimmers through the verdant Gloom  Here pendant Lawns the limpid Mirrors grace  With blooming Blushes and with vary'd Face  Reflected Beauties 'mid the Chrystal Scene  For ever purple and for ever green  The Sense and Judgment at one View delight  Regale the Fancy and surprize the Sight  With Breast elate I climb the shapely Mound  An  Eden  smiling where a Chaos frown'd  O'er the grim Rock a flow'ry Mantle thrown  With daisy'd Verdure decks the craggy Stone  From Quarries rent which rugged rose and rude  By Rigour soften'd and by Toil subdu'd  The gentle Slopes so easy here uprise  As Nature's Hand would human Art disguise  So when some awful Sage whose manly Mind  By Virtue warm'd and Love of Humankind  A savage Race in wild Disorder saw  Of barb'rous Manners fierce and brutal Law  With painful Steps he wins his arduous Way  By slow Degrees and bends them to obey  Till tam'd at last in social State they stand  By Reason rul'd and bless the forming Hand  On publick Worth let each Delight attend  Delight the Means but Worth be still the End  The virtuous Cause shall wise Effects procure  Who tills the fallow'd Glebe shall feed the Poor  Shall make the Rustick smile his Garners groan  And in his Neighbour's Wealth enjoy his own  For this the Fields shall richer Blooms display  The Groves shall gladden and the Hills look gay  For this the Springs in lucid Lakes shall flow  The Temples glitter and the Gardens glow  Let me amid thy Bowers delighted stray  Or on thy breezy Summits waste the Day  Wrapt in Elysium wander through thy Groves  Which calm Reflection courts and Fancy loves  There in some murm'ring Grott my Folly lose  And drink Oblivion with the sacred Muse  From airy Hopes and groundless Fears secure  Enjoy Existence or its Ills endure  O Solitude Divine where Reason dwells  No Pride provokes thee and no Passion swells  Let me repos'd in thy serene Embrace  From human Evils farfrom human Race  Let me entranc'd on thy soft Bosom lie  And all th' insulting Storms of Life defy  There to itself restore the injur'd Mind  And be what Nature and what God design'd  Let then the Statesman hatch his gilded Schemes  And canton Kingdoms in extatic Dreams  In greedy Visions grasp th' incircl'd Ball  Whilst butcher'd Millions to his Frenzy fall  Their Pelf and Party let the World pursue  For what my Friend has Reason there to do  From hostile Storms escap'd that harrass'd Dove  Now seeks her Safety in the silent Grove  Where you tread Paths by thoughtful Science made  And court the Muses in the letter'd Shade  There at each tow'ring System taught to smile  Which erring Fancy founds or Pride can pile  There still on Truth to fix your stedfast Eyes  And point out Falshood in her gay Disguise  There with your Country's Weal your Wishes blend  To sacred Freedom and her Cause a Friend  By publick Virtue warm'd your Bosom glows  And only Slaves and Tyrants are your Foes  But waft my Muse to yonder Bow'r thy Strains  Where Wisdom governs and where Reason reigns  Where sweet Content each vital Blessing brings  And o'er the genial Board extends her Wings  There smiling Concord fills her Halcyon Throne  Of Joys sincere possess'dto Kings unknown  Harmonious Hearts her heav'nly Laws obey  And waiting Angels guide her peaceful Sway  What pleasing Sounds thus circle through the Gale  What Sweets extatick o'er my Mind prevail  Ye Zephyrs hush O sostly pant the Breeze  Ye Doves be dumb  Melinda  strikes the Keys  As near I move my ravish'd Senses find  Her Musick gives the Image of her Mind  Where tuneful Passions gently rise and fall  With temper'd Energy at Reason's Call  That mental Melody which Art exceeds  Sounds in her Words and varies in her Deeds  Conn bial Symphony whose equal Tone  Still in her Consort's Wishes finds her own  Their circling Joys in mutual Measures move  And ev'ry added Day those Joys improve  But see their Hopes to distant Prospects run  A blooming Daughter and a darling Son  That growing Bliss which rip'ning Youth endears  The Pride and Promise of maturer Years  By Meekness rob'd her gentle Garb they wear  For Virtue form'd them with peculiar Care  To lodge true Worth their op'ning Minds she dress'd  And filial Duty came the foremost Guest  Nor came alone she soon engag'd a Place  For Manly Talents and for Female Grace  Then Sense and Wit their fair Apartments fill  By mild Discretion guided at her Will  Breeding and Decency came next behind  And Honour rais'd and Goodness warm'd the Mind  Beauty indeed would fain her Place secure  But Angellike she waits at Wisdom's Door  Can there on Earth exist more true Delight  Or gracious Heav'n an happier Pair unite  Esteem and Worth in growing Commerce blend  And each a Lover lives and each a Friend  To a FRIEND on his Marriage  A Choice so bless'd Heav'n only could inspire  To give a Foretaste of the Joys above  How gaily native Innocence lights up  The Charms of Beauty's pow'rful Glance and shines  Conspicuous in her lovely Smile mature  In Wit above her tender Years she seems  Design'd to show Perfection in her Dawn  Where Fruits and Blossoms charm at once our View  And all the Seasons meet the early Spring  Let Wealth no more o'er tender Hearts prevail  With Magick Glitter nor debase the Mind  To barter gen'rous Love for sordid Gold  Gold from reluctant Nature's Bowels rent  The Bane of Peace and Pest of Humankind  See here ye Avaritious treasur'd Gems  Through Chrystal Caskets blaze Gems brighter far  Than Orient Pearl or  India  's sparkling Stone  Whose neverfading Lustre needs no Foil  On humble Ground in native Meekness set  Can hoarded Pelf with such a Fund compare  To thousands Slave the Miser's Idol God  The Spendthrift's Curse when Beauty shines enrich'd  From Heav'n's inestimable boundless Store  With all the Virtues that adorn the Mind  For social Converse and the Joys of Life  To sweeten Cares and bless the marry'd State  When these united in one Bosom dwell  What Monarch on his gorgeous Throne elate  Shall proudly dare to claim so rich a Prize  And yet to thee her plighted Hand she gave  Nor staid I ween her faithful Heart behind  In her Embrace be thou as fully bless'd  As mortal Essences can be who Bliss  Consummate never here can know  Since Cares intruding thrust themselves between  And Pain oft petrifies the Couch of Down  From these her Arms a sure Asylum yield  Where ev'ry anxious Care shall refuge find  And chang'd to Joy corrode the Heart no more  May Years returning in soft Circles roll  And lengthen'd Days increase your growing Loves  Till Time shall Passion into Friendship turn

secret Workings and mysterious Laws  Her winding Labyrinths you make your own  You ward the fell Effect you crush the Cause  Nor Gain nor Vanity thy Mind can move  To lift the Weari'd and the Anguish'd ease  Thy ruling Avarice the publick Love  Thy utmost Pride a Heart humane to please  And see Success thy happy Steps attend  Success thy Goodness and thy Talents claim  Let then the feeble Efforts of a Friend  Join the strong Current of thy spreading Fame  To a FRIEND  SInce Knaves are captious and since Fools are dull  Who'd wish to wrangle with a Knave or Fool  Fond of his Notions let the Dunce be vain  And his just Right to Emptiness maintain  Stiff and conceited in his clumsey Pride  And ever loudest on the erring Side  By stupid Hearsay not by Knowledge led  Whole Heaps of vulgar Errors crowd his Head  His Judgment too for nought he understands  Lies like his Money in some other Hands  And yet the Selfadmiring silly Ass  Conceits that both alike should current pass  Some crony Coxcomb o'er his Foible reigns  From whom he borrows what supplies his Brains  With Sentiments absurd and silly Views  Which he with Pride precipitate pursues  Such senseless Sots are ever rapid found  Like Bodies bounding from a higher Ground  Their headlong Haste slow trundling to a Stand  Is ever equal to th' impressive Hand  Who meerly passive to Direction's Force  One follows one as Horse is link'd to Horse  Alternate tread the beaten Track they find  The Father leads the Son comes on behind  And both are burthen'd still and both are blind  Whence comes this Prejudice that rules the Throng  So absolute confounding Right with Wrong  Is it from Fathers to their Sons effus'd  Or is it Custom has the World abus'd  Custom that Reason's Foe so oft appears  Strengthen'd by Age and rev'rend made by Years  The hoary Sorceress with Magick Hand  Inchants whole Millions to her wide Command  Lo gaping Multitudes her Nod attend  Revere her Dictates and her Laws defend  Where Truth dethron'd to silent Shades must fly  And Reason close her clear discerning Eye  The Goddess banish'd from this peopl'd Ball  By few is worship'd and prophan'd by all  Ten thousand various Shapes her Vot'ries wear  The Shapes as various as the Vot'ries are  Yet each with partial Pride his own surveys  'Tis Reason's Liv'ry and must Reason please  He vainly thinks For so Selflove descries  The tinsel Trappings with extatick Eyes  Whose dazzl'd Rays imagin'd Splendors find  Where Fancy glitters and where Sense is blind  Tho' Truth's a Sun tho' Reason lends its Light  Yet groping Mortals wander still in Night  Such Fogs from Custom and from Passions rise  Which daily cloud their intellectual Skies  Seduc'd by Pride the Sons of Men are led  Pride rules the Heart and Pride supplies the Head  'Tis hence the Atheist scoffs at Faith and Creeds  The Sage dies poring and the Soldier bleeds  Hence wicked Wits would laugh Religion down  And surly Churchmen wear th' indignant Frown  Pride o'er the Passions holds despotick Rule  Sneers in the Knave and whispers in the Fool  Deck'd in rich Robes with princely Pomp she dwells  Yet lurks she not with Hermits in their Cells  The same which mounts the glitt'ring  Persian  Throne  And creeps with cavern'd  Anchorites  unknown  In some she labours Life's short Course to steer  Sound the flat Shelves and from the Rocks keep clear  A decent Pride through op'ning Seas will sail  Scorn the Bycreek and court the gen'rous Gale  'Tis virtuous there for Virtue fix'd the Bound  'Tis vicious here for Vice o'erleap'd the Mound  Extreams with equal Energy conspire  Like scorching Qualities of Frost and Fire  Happy the few which in the Middle stand  A rigid Justice leans to neither Hand  But nicely eyes when this or that prevails  And ponders Life in Truth's unerring Scales  Could Worth and Wisdom act a mutual Part  Serene the Head and social were the Heart  Were Man a private and a publick Friend  And of his Being answer'd ev'ry End  His Wishes free from ev'ry sensual Chain  His Thoughts unruffl'd and his Soul serene  Bless'd to enjoy what calm Content bestows  Nor dreading still that calm Content to lose  A State so blissful Mortals ne'er must know  Who seeks an  Eden  finds a Waste below  Look round alas the dismal Prospect scan  This Sea tempestuous and that Vessel Man  Toss'd by his Wishes by his Passions driv'n  This Wretch of Reason and this Heir of Heav'n  In giddy Whirls can find no certain Coast  His Pilot blinded and his Steerage lost  Since hateful Vice in every Clime is found  Shoots in each Soil and choaks the burthen'd Ground  Infects the Essence of the human Soul  And sheds her spreading Plagues from Pole to Pole  Can then strict Order with Confusion stay  Or mortal Man th' eternal Rule obey  By Nature prone he takes the strongest Part  And joins the Rebel Motions in his Heart  Revolting daily to th' intestine Foes  What Precepts can the faithless Heart oppose  Should mild Religion lend her sacred Hand  To raise the sinking Wretch and bid him stand  Yet even she allgracious and benign  Must weep defeated and her Claim resign  So strong is Nature and so weak is Grace  So much misguided is this reas'ning Race  Tho' Folly has the madding World o'errun  Yet Wisdom here and there has sav'd a Son  Selected sure by Heav'n's peculiar Love  To brighten Nature and to shine above  As Stars of larger Magnitude on high  The Earth enlighten and adorn the Sky  Thus  Plato  glitter'd godlike  Newton  shone  Thus  Bacon  once and once an  Addison  Illustrious Names by Providence design'd  To beam its Bounty and direct Mankind  A thousand lesser Lights in Life appear  Distinguish'd high in Nature's Hemisphere  Hung out by Heav'n to guide our Course below  Correct our Wand'rings and our Safeties show  Whose Lustre much but whose true Progress more  Guides our frail Barks and points to Wisdom's Shore  On seeing a Picture of his Royal Highness the Prince of  WALES  which was presented to the University of  Dublin  IN Time's widewasting Walk with backward Tread  Through Fancy's Retrospect I journey'd far  Where human Glory in her Piles lay spread  The Arch triumphal and the trophy'd Car  Deep in th' Abyss of that mysterious Gloom  Where Embryon Years and dire Contingents grow  Like Twins matur'd in Time's allteeming Womb  Whence Pride's fell Progeny and Discord flow  There laurel'd Chiefs and Heroes old I saw  A headlong hardy dread destructive Train  Their God Ambition and their Will their Law  Tremendous Prodigies and Nature's Bane  By Pride impell'd and Fame's fallacious Blast  In Virtue's Garb which Madmen Glory call  At destin'd Life the deathful Spear they cast  And tore the Vitals of this wounded Ball  O Shame of Reason and her boastful Sons  Instinct they scorn whose Footstep never strays  Yet she unerring to her Purpose runs  Her Ends are certain tho' unmark'd her Ways  Let human Arrogance from hence be taught  How wide from Rectitude her Passions roam  Passions abroad for Happiness have sought  But Happiness with Nature dwells at home  Pensive I view'd through deep Reflection's Ken  Excentrick Reason and the Rounds of Time  With all the mazy Labyrinths of Men  Opinion's Frenzy and Ambition's Crime  With Eyes averted from th' unsocial Scene  The Muses led me to a sacred Shade  Where laurel'd Grotto's bloom'd for ever green  And peaceful Olives in the Zephyrs play'd  Secure inwrapt beneath th' embracing Wing  Of solemn Science and serene Repose  Celestial Transports in my Fancy spring  And glorious Visions to my Soul disclose  Wasted methought where blissful Shades upgrow  Amidst a flow'ry Vale intranc'd I lay  Where winding Streams in limpid Mazes flow  And crested Swans down Silver Currents stray  There highhung Rocks by crimson Fragrance crown'd  With gentle Force reflect the Noontide Beams  Whilst gushing Springs from Chrystal Caverns sound  And floating Rills diffuse their falling Streams  To pierce the Clouds th' aspiring Cliffs uprose  From boist'rous Storms and savage Man secure  Beneath all Nature's Wealth uninjur'd grows  Her Bounty blesses and her Charms endure  One downward Walk slow winding from on high  By Virtue's Hand and willing Nature made  Invites the curious Mind and searching Eye  To seek with cautious Steps fair Wisdom's Shade  But see the Goddess heav'nly bright appears  Persuasion pleading in her Smile serene  A thousand Charms her graceful Form endears  And Peace exults and Pleasure in her Mien  A Crown unfading on her Brow she bore  With Virtues Emblems and her Gems inlaid  The Crown immortal which of old she wore  Ere yet Ambition had the World dismay'd  Her favour'd Sons from 'midst the madding Crowd  Her Sons select with gentle Hand she drew  Secreted timely from th' austere and proud  Their Fame widespreading tho' their Numbers few  Great Nature's Secrets in the Shade they sought  Nor gaz'd attentive on the deephid Store  Of treasur'd Mischiefs in her Bosom wrought  The dazzling Diamond and th' enticing Ore  Guiltless as yet within its darksome Bed  Unrifl'd in the Virgin Globe it lay  No sordid Fancy on its Splendors fed  Nor drag'd the deep Infection forth to Day  Now by a Chrystal Fountain's pure Expanse  They view the Windings of the starry Train  That through th' etherial Concave nightly dance  Or rise refulgent from the purple Main  So Wisdom's Sons sequester'd from the Throng  Of Custom's Captives and her Slaves misled  In Freedom happy and in Virtue strong  From Crimes were shielded and from conscious Dread  Thus bloom'd the Goddess in her Reign retir'd  To Triumphs fell and fatal Fields unknown  Her gentle Sway no sanguine Wreath requir'd  In Halcyon Hearts she fix'd her friendly Throne  Now mighty Monarchs by her Charms are won  Who gaze enamour'd on her Face Divine  And Slaves and Tyrants to her Temples run  Embrace her Altars and adore her Shrine  The Muse attendant in her radiant Way  Beholds her shining like the Morning Star  Herself unfolding in a Flood of Day  Diffusing Science and her Light from far  From  Egypt  beaming and the splendid East  To  Greece  she travel'd on the Wings of Fame  Their op'ning Gates receive

Declin'd for once her Bard's Embrace  Like fickle Wantons here below  Who random Favours wildly shew  He anxious courted her Return  But she rejects his Vows with Scorn  Those Vows which could but ill aspire  When she withheld her heav'nly Fire  In vain on Fancy he depends  His heavy Fancy still descends  The heldup Crown the mighty Prize  The Laurel green that never dies  And all that on  Parnassus  grows  Or from  Pierian  Fountains flows  The Sons of  Phoebus  to reward  And crown the visionary Bard  At distance far he faintly views  Then inward sighs and blames the Muse  But Mortals to vain Fears resign'd  In Darkness to what lies behind  The mystic Veil let down by Jove  To screen his Purposes above  When dusky Doubts desponding press  From present Ills the future guess  Dismissing Hope when Succour's near  They blindly rush upon Despair  For lo the Nymph of Form divine  With Presence sweet and Smiles benign  His Vows at length propitious hears  And in a Vision bright appears  As in a Gloom where Poplars rise  A gentle Slumber clos'd his Eyes  Her shape celestial she displays  Her radiant Head was crown'd with Bays  Her Shoulders fledg'd with purple Wings  And in one Hand a Laurel springs  Which she extended held on high  Emblem of Fame and Victory  A trembling Lyre the other shews  Which on her Bard the Muse bestows  But touching first th' etherial Wire  Inflam'd his Soul with sacred Fire  Diffusing Transport through each Part  And melting Rapture round his Heart  Descending now with yielding Eye  And pointing to the Wreath on high  Behold she said ambitious Bard  The Prize you seek the rich Reward  Which shall employ the Trump of Fame  In sounding forth your envy'd Name  Yet these high Favours which you court  Are not vouchsaf'd for trivial Sport  A playful Fancy to employ  Or glitter on some tinsel Toy  A Theme distinguish'd I will find  That shall exalt thy ardent Mind  Where Truth and Genius justly may  Each others Excellence display  On such Foundations building Praise  The polish'd Pile secure you'll raise  Embellish'd high in ev'ry Part  With all the beauteous Strokes of Art  Where she and Nature both conspire  And at their own Success admire  Gross Flatt'ry here can find no Place  You need but copy ev'ry Grace  A Nymph with Lineaments divine  And envy'd by the tuneful Nine  For sprightly Wit and Genius known  And Judgment equal to their own  A Critick nice but not severe  A Mind as tender as sincere  Shall your successful Subject be  In singing her you're sure of me  The Graces too shall all attend  And ev'ry Pow'r thy

unmix'd and pure  Shall lasting as itself endure  Her outward Charms her youthful Prime  May yield at length to rifling Time  But those within elude his Sway  And late shall triumph o'er Decay  If

their Blaze  How happy then th' accomplish'd Maid  Where Virtue joins in Beauty's Aid  Where Meekness makes true Merit rise  And heightens Charms it would disguise  By busy Fancy thus employ'd  The pleasing Dream I long enjoy'd  The Vision fled I waking find  The lovely Image in my Mind  My kindling Fancy soon took Fire  I joyful snatch the sounding Lyre  By  Clio  's heav'nly Finger strung  And all th' extatic Vision sung  Ardelia  's Worth demands the Song  To her my future Strains belong  For she improves each Line I write  Her Blots still make my Numbers bright  Thrice happy Numbers doom'd to lie  Beneath the Influence of her Eye  Imbibing thence as from the Sun  A Life and Vigour not their own  To a young  LADY  who had made an Epigram on  TIME  but refus'd to give a Copy  WHY

Gold your Sterling Strain  Should circle with the Sun  In vain you mask in Housewife Airs  In vain disguise your Wit  Through ev'ry Look your Sense appears  Thro' ev'ry Smile the Cheat  Prithee no longer thus affect  Your Talents to conceal  Let Wit its own bright Beam detect  And throw aside the Veil  Nor need you fear your Friends should blame  They know your Worth too long  That you on Sense build solid Fame  Not on a trifling Song  A furnish'd House your Mind appears  Where Firmness claims a Place  Yet Ornament the Fancy chears  And Pictures give a Grace  Your Subject  Time  will never stay  Then use it to kind Ends  Nor think your Moments thrown away  When you instruct your Friends  On a Young  LADY DANCING  Who did great  EXECUTION  without knowing it  WHEN  Stella  glides with

Mind  So youthful Victors at their Wheels  Unheeded Captives drag behind  Ah  Stella  know thy Power betimes  Guiltless in thee yet fatal found  Thy Eyes indeed commit no Crimes  Yet ev'ry Glance conveys a Wound  With Caution use thy dang'rous Charms  Which now at Random thus annoy  And gently wield those glitt'ring Arms  By Beauty brighten'd to destroy  At least behold thy Victims fall  Their

bless'd the gladsome Scene  Her Locks Love's Labyrinth reveal  They wanton in the balmy Gale  The balmy Gale her Locks unfurl  And rifle Fragrance from each Curl  Which scatter'd Odours as they play'd  Her snowy Breasts such Charms betray'd  As might the coldest Heart inspire  And warm old Age with youthful Fire  With Eyes intent she gently moves  Attended by a thousand Loves  A Paper glitters in her Hands  The Edge was Gold and Gold the Sands  That o'er the soft Contents were shed  The Letters spangled as she read  Her Eyes enrich the lucid Lines  A gentle Lustre from them shines  Then blushing sighs with silent Shame  And seems her secret Wish to blame  Her Wishes then themselves declare  No Wish unkind possess'd the Fair  For mighty Love her Bosom sway'd  And sweet  Myrtilla  Love obey'd  Damon  she said how pure thy Flame  And as she said she kiss'd the Name  How long did I thy Vows reprove  Deaf to thy Sighs and blind to Love  Too proud thy Passion to exchange  Regardless of

sought like her the Morning Shade  Where in a Gloom with Moss o'ergrown  He makes his melancholy Moan  He hears her speak he sees her move  And what he hears and sees is Love  Quick in his Soul soft Tumults rose  His Blood in rushing Currents flows  His Pulse and Breath unequal play  Depriv'd of Motion as he lay  Myrtilla  now approaches near  His Bosom beats with Hope and Fear  As nearer still the Damsel drew  The tender Tumult thicker grew  Her plaintive Voice on  Damon  calls  She sees him pant then starting falls  And falling with disorder'd Charms  She drops into her  Damon  's Arms

And warms with vital Beams the Night  By Fortune forc'd to foreign Climes  From thy hospitious Shades to roam  Accept sweet Place these parting Rhimes  I pay to thee my friendly Home  Sacred to thee my grateful Lyre  Shall oft thy absent Shades deplore  Thy absent Shades shall wake its Wyre  On  Albion  's wide refounding Shore  No length of Time shall e'er deface  Thy Image in my thankful Breast  Reflection there thy Form shall trace  In lasting Characters impress'd  In thee my Worth and Wit prevail  In thee the blooming Laurel grow  May Health be wasted in each Gale  And Plenty's Cup still social flow  Long thy  Apollo  there display  The Virtues of his gen'rous Mind  Diffusing like the God of Day  His bounteous Beams on all Mankind  On viewing the  Monument  of the Right Honourable  William Conolly  Esq  AS on the Patriot's aweful Form we gaze  The breathing Marble his great Soul displays  Reclin'd and pale with pungent Pains oppress'd  He feels his Country in his dying Breast  For her dear Sake would ward th' impending Dart  From her reluctant not from Life to part  For ever firm to Heav'n's high Will resign'd  He calmly cast th' impartial Eye behind  There the bright Virtue of each wellspent Year  Beams on his Soul nor leaves one Cloud of Fear  Bless'd Shade one Moment cease thy Bliss to know  And view wellpleas'd that pious Form below  Oh see thy Country in thy Consort weep  And o'er thy Ashes grateful Vigils keep  Her servent Pray'r to Heav'n like Incense flew  On Angel Wings a Sacrifice for you  The pure Oblation pass'd th' eternal Gate  And rose sweet smelling round the MercyScat  But Heav'n alas the Soulbreath'd Wish denies  Heav'n weigh'd thy Worth and call'd thee to the Skies  Still o'er thy Shrine thy faithful Consort bows  Still to thy Mem'ry pays her plighted Vows  See Grandeur here by social Virtue grac'd  The Manner noble as refin'd the Taste  Not Pride but Piety there strikes our Eyes  And Meekness lifts yon Pillar to the Skies  Why smokes at Noon that hospitable Dome  To feed the Fatherless the Orphan's Home  By thy Example thus she wings her Way  Once more to meet thee in the Realms of Day  She treads thy shining Path keeps still in Sight  Thy Beam illustrious and reflects thy Light  Thus in the crimson West the Lamp of Day  Resplendent sets and sinks his radiant Ray  In th' Azure East inrob'd with milder Beams  The Queen of Night sends forth her chearing Gleams  Connubial Lustre o'er the Ocean sheds  Glads the low Vales and gilds the Mountain Heads  To a FRIEND  To thee in  Tempe  's blissful Shade  From  Bolesworth  's Brow I write  A happy Place by Nature made  For Pleasure and Delight  Here slow'ry Hills o'er fertile Vales  In gay Confusion rise  Here smiling Health amid the Gales  On purple Pinions flies  Here rural Sports the Mind engage  To pass the pleasing Day  Here  Tilson  quits his  Tully  's Page  To turn the tedded Hay  From  London  far and State Affairs  Sagacious he retires  Each tranquil Bliss serene he shares  Which Solitude inspires  No Passions rude can here annoy  His undissembled Smile  Domestick Sweets connubial Joy  Must ev'ry Care beguile  Still near her Side his Soul approves  In Love and Friendship bless'd  Each tender Sentiment that moves  Within her faithful Breast  His lovely Babes like Lambkins play  Sportive in  April  Sun  Rejoicing meet him in his Way  Or prattling round him run  Thus lightly gay the Moments fly  Which feel no Weight of Care  Could Time but throw his Pinions by  He'd wish to settle here  Nor less Delight attends on thee  My  Bassus  in thy Bow'r  Where Sense and Genius both agree  To crown thy classic Hour  In quest of Truth you only tread  The Path by Reason made  By no delusive Guides misled  Of no false Lights afraid  What more could bount'ous Heav'n bestow  Thy Blessings to secure  It gave the sweetest Pledge below  To make them long endure  In thy accomplish'd honour'd Fair  Thy Bosombliss refin'd  Whose winning Virtues all appear  Harmonious as her Mind  And see the beauteous blooming Maid  Thy Hope thy Joy and Pride  With ev'ry pleasing Charm array'd  With ev'ry Grace supply'd  Which Nature's Hand can gently frame  Or polish'd Art refine  To make her rich in Virtue's Fame  And like her Mother shine  Thou darling Youth whose dawning Mind  The Muses all desire  In thy bright Thoughts we early find  Thy Father's Sense and Fire  To thee my  Clio  grateful still  Shall consecrate her Theme  And sing thee plac'd on  Pindus  ' Hill  Or at the sacred Stream  Each letter'd Art imbibing there  With ev'ry Grace combin'd  To make thee to thy Country dear  The Wish of Humankind  To thee in  Tempe  's blissful Shade  This grateful Verse I send  The Verse sincere tho' poorly paid  To thee my honour'd Friend  On a publick Collection made for the distress'd Remains of the  Inniskillen  and  Derry  Men Inscrib'd to the Right Honourable the Lord  Tullamore  SEE social Worth extend her copious Hand  See publick Virtue warm a faithful Land  See Freedom's Sons in gen'rous League combin'd  Who ardent cast their grateful Eyes behind  With kindling Hearts their Fathers Deeds survey  Who snatch'd from lawless Pow'r th' important Prey  Uplifting Liberty when prostrate spread  They bravely conquer'd or as bravely bled  To you descends the Patriot's honour'd Name  To you the Pledge of Truth the Thirst of Fame  The glorious Legacy by you possest  Beams on each Brow and burns in ev'ry Breast  A Deed like this sure Heav'n wellpleas'd shall see  You loose those Hands which help'd to make you free  Nor you whose Heart with gen'rous Fervour glows  The Joy of Want and Balm of human Woes  Your Country's Prop nor you my Lord refuse  Amid the publick Praise the grateful Muse  Kind Heav'n has planted in your noble Frame  What Worth can minister what Want can claim  Your bount'ous Hand is ever foremost found  To raise the Weak and bind up ev'ry Wound  When niggard Nature lock'd each vital Store  When Land and Water gave their Growths no more  When ghastly Famine o'er each Face was spread  And pale  Eblana  droop'd her dying Head  Your saving Pow'r the sick'ning Sun supplies  Unbinds the Glebe and thaws th' inclement Skies  Look back my Lord your pious Schemes enjoy  Let warlike Chiefs still anxious to destroy  Spread Ruin round and Death and Danger brave  Your Fame from Mercy springs your Pride's to save  You seek that Crown whose Gems shall ever glow  When  Derry  falls and  Boyn  shall cease to flow  With  William  's Worth your virtuous Deeds shall soar  When Triumphs fail and  Albion  sways no more  Above the fading Stars expiring Rays  When Systems sink and Suns withdraw their Blaze  On his Excellency the Earl of  CHESTERFIELD  's resigning the Government of  Ireland  WHere dismal Melancholy moping reigns  'Midst a dark Vale which horrid Rocks surround  Where steril Rigour rules the lonesome Plains  Nor ever Verdure decks the blasted Ground  Where howling Winds through clifted Caverns blow  And Birds obscene their baleful Mansions keep  Where mimick Echo mocks each Sound of Woe  And humid Caves with Tears eternal weep  Hibernia'  s Guardian Goddess prostrate there  Lay brooding o'er her mighty Grief retir'd  Her rev'rend Head reclin'd her Bosom bare  In tragick Weeds disconsolate attir'd  Each Native Attribute dejected stands  Each Virtue sunk each Orphan Art dismay'd  And widow'd Science wrung her plaintive Hands  And listless Sorrow fix'd the Face of Trade  The Muse Attendant on the mournful Train  With silent Grief the solemn Scene surveys  In broken Sighs she breathes her Heartfelt Pain  Her Lyre unstrung and wither'd all her Bays  As from a Trance the Goddess gently 'woke  Then rising slowly with maternal Grace  Thus in faint Sounds her lab'ring Anguish spoke  Whilst copious Tears ran trickling down her Face  Unhappy Isle thy shortliv'd Triumph dies  How scant the Sunshine of thy brightest Day  What Cloud malign o'ercasts thy chearful Skies  What sudden Night obscures the Noontide Ray  Too soon  Britannia  stretch'd her envious Hand  Too soon alas she snatch'd the Man so dear  Whose Power serene in Perils could command  Whose Skill thro' threat'ning Storms with Safety steer  Each Art reviv'd by his auspicious Smile  Shone with new Elegance and Pomp array'd  In decent State uprose the Regal Pile  And the rich Column grac'd the newborn Glade  Bless'd with the Fruits of his paternal Toil  My grateful Sons with joyful Hearts obey  Exulting Concord crowns my fertil Soil  And ev'ry Virtue waits on STANHOPE's Sway  O  Albion  to my longing Arms return  The godlike Patriot from thy warm Embrace  With Pity hear thy faithful Sister mourn  Calm her sad Conflict and restore her Peace  But if alas by Fate's severe Decree  In thy bright Hemisphere this Star must shine  Oh may his Rays oblique yet glance on me  Though his exalted Splendors still be thine  FINIS
