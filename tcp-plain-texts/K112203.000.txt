his superior excellence in his profession which was  Drawing  the principal part of Painting was very learned in all the Italian Arts and particularly in their Poetry and Music the subject of this little work more learned I believe than any man in Great Britain  As Beauty is pretty much the same in all the Fine Arts there being a cognation as Cicero expresses it by which they are connected and related more or less to one another Mr Brown has shown in this work that he knew very well what Beauty was in Writing as well as in other Arts for there is in his stile a copiousness and elegance and withal an accuracy of expression which are seldom to be met with in the compositions of this age and both for matter and stile I will venture to set this little piece against any thing that has been written en the subject of the Fine  Arts in modern times and I am persuaded it would have been still more perfect in every respect if he had lived to publish it himself He has explained most accurately every thing belonging to the Italian Opera beginning with the  Recitative  by which the business or action of the Opera the principal thing in all dramatic performances is carried on and then proceeding to the  Airs  or  Songs  by which the sentiments and passions of the  Dramatis Personae  are expressed These Airs he has divided and explained so accurately as to show very clearly  'that there is no affection of the  human breast' to use his own words and I cannot use better 'from the slightest and most gentle stirring of sentiment to the most frantic degree of passion which some one of these classes' of Airs 'is not aptly suited to express  Letter in the beginning  '  He has also shown how the descriptive part in the Opera is executed and of what good use the Orchestra is there which is so indiscreetly employed in the British Operas  Page  In this passage he has very justly censured our taste in Operas And in another  passage  Page  he has said that  'the admiration bestowed in Britain on difficulty and novelty in preference to beauty and simplicity is the effect not of the decline but of the total want of taste and proceeds from the same principles with the admiration of tumbling and ropedancing which the multitude may gaze on with astonishment long before they are susceptible of the charms of graceful and elegant Pantomime these feats of agility having exactly the same relation to fine  dancing that the above mentioned Airs have to expressive Music'  And in the same passage he observes that this admiration of the new and difficult which begins to prevail in Italy is a symptom of the decline of the Arts there so that he appears to me to have had a taste not only superior to what is to be found in Britain but even to the taste at present in Italy the country of the Fine Arts and I have heard from others as well as from him that the burletta and the taste for the ridiculous is prevailing very much in Italy than which there can be no surer sign of  the decline of genius and taste in a nation But the serious Italian Opera as he has described it and as it is acted in Rome though it may not be so perfect as it formerly was is still the most perfect junction of Poetry Music and Action or Dancing as the ancients called it which among them was an Art of Imitation as well as Poetry and Music the three finest of the Fine Arts that is now to be found in the world and such as only can give us any idea of  Attic Tragedies of stateliest and most regal argument  to use an expression of Milton with which that  learned and elegant people were so much delighted and upon the representation of which they bestowed the greatest part of the revenue of their state This work therefore of Mr Brown will give great pleasure not only to the Connoisseurs in Music but also I hope to all the admirers of ancient Arts and I am sure that all those who were acquainted with him and knew him to be a man of great worth as well as genius will be very glad to encourage this publication for the benefit of his widow and child  The following character written by a learned and ingenious friend of the deceased Mr BROWN appeared in a periodical publication a short time after his death  JOANNES BROWN Pictor eximius nonis Septembribus anno salutis Edinae urbis suae natalis diem obiit supremum anaos natus triginta quinque Neminem fere virum

Lordship a distinct idea not only of the various kinds of verse made use of by the Italians in their Opera but of the principles also by which the application of that variety is directed I find it necessary to take into consideration the union of poetry and music which is  peculiar to this species of drama The nature of this union seems to have been well understood by their best dramatic writers and they have seldom lost sight of it in their works whilst those of our poets who have written Cantatas or other compositions for music appear either to have been not at all acquainted with it or if they were to have totally disregarded it The Italians have with great propriety considered that the speeches in the drama whether in dialogue or soliloquy must be either such as are expressive of passion and sentiment or such as are not so On this real distinction and not as with us on the mere caprice of the composer is founded  their first great division of vocal music into  recitative  and  air  It is evident on the slightest consideration that in the progress of the drama many passages must necessarily occur such as simple narration of facts directions given plain answers made to plain questions sometimes abstract truths or moral reflectionsnone of which as they contain nothing of passion or sentiment can ever become the subject of musical expression Simply to have spoken these passages however and then abruptly to have set up a singing when any pathetic part presented itself would have produced exactly that barbarous jumble of prose and poetry of music and dissonance  which characterizes the English comic opera To avoid this and at the same time not idly to bestow the charms of fancy and feeling where embellishment and expression would be improper the Italians have invented that species of singing termed by them  simple recitative  Its name almost sufficiently explains its nature It is a succession of notes so arranged as to coincide with the laws of harmony tho' never accompanied but by a single instrument whose office is merely to support the voice and to direct it in its modulations Though for the sake of this accompanyment recitative is like other music divided into bars yet are not these bars as in other  music necessarily of equal lengths the notes of which they are composed being subjected to no precise musical measure but regulated in this respect almost wholly by the natural prosody of the language Thus this kind of recitative answers completely its end It detains the audience very little longer than the spoken recital would do and being music itself the transition from it to the higher and more interesting parts is perfectly natural and agreeable to the ear  According to your Lordship's opinion that there is scarcely any such thing as long and short syllables in modern languages the notes of the Italian recitative would be all of equal lengths To obviate this objection I must take notice that what your Lordship would call the  accented  syllable they esteem the  long  one and whatever may be the case in speech in pronouncing the recitative they most certainly render it longer in the proportion generally of  two  to  one  Thus the words  ămō tălōr cĕdē fĭnī tŏrnāi  in which the accent is laid on the last syllable are in recitative positively iambics the first syllable being expressed by a quaver the other by a crotchet thus  ămō tălōr  {quaver note}{crotchet note} {quaver note}{crotchet note} c the last of which characters is the sign of a duration of time exactly double the length of that denoted by the first Those again which have the accent on the first syllable as  āmŏ bēnĕ ciēlŏ trōmbă  {crotchet note}{quaver note} {crotchet note}{quaver note} {crotchet note}{quaver note} {crotchet note}{quaver note} are trochaics All the Articles of two syllables such as  delle alli  c and the Pronouns personal when joined with another monosyllable such as  mene celo vela tissi glielo  c may with the strictest propriety be considered as each a pyrrhic foot which in recitative would accordingly be expressed bv two quavers  mĕnĕ cĕlŏ  {quaver note}{quaver note} {quaver note}{quaver note}c The words  dōcĭlĕ flēbĭlĕ mōrmŏră  {crotchet note}{quaver note}{quaver note} {crotchet note}{quaver note}{quaver note} {crotchet note}{quaver note}{quaver note} are thus real dactyles whilst such as these again  tĭmōrĕ ŏnōrĕ  c {quaver note}{crotchet note}{quaver note} {quaver note}{crotchet note}{quaver note} are to all intents and purposes each a foot consisting of a short a long and a short syllable Nay I may go so far as to say that no species of foot occurs in the ancient poetry which is not frequently to be found in the Italian recitative in which three successive short three successive long syllables and often four of each are to be found and indeed all the possible varieties in which long and short syllables can be combined together Now though it be allowed that the Italian verse is formed not by the number of feet but of syllables it is fair to conclude that this manner of reciting it by which not only various combinations of them are formed but their respective length and brevity positively ascertained must not only give additional beauty and variety to the verse but render the pronunciation itself more clear and explicit    The verse appropriated to recitative is of a mixed kind consisting of the  heroic line of eleven syllables and of a line of seven syllables with now and  then a rhyme In the intermingling however these lines with each other  as well as with respect to the introduction of the rhymes the poet is entirely left to the guidance of his own ear and sentiment This kind of mixed verse from the variety of the cadences which it affords seems well calculated to give to the recitative as marked a resemblance to common speech as is consistent with the dignity and beauty of numbers whilst the sparing and judicious introduction of rhyme either to finish more highly some beautiful passage or more strongly to point some remarkable assertion or  reflection serves to preserve throughout the piece a proper degree of unity of effect by preventing that irksome and unnatural dissimilarity between the recitative and the airs which would in some degree be the consequence of the want of this kind of medium Upon the whole it appears admirably well suited to the less important parts of a production so refined and artificial as the Opera whose object like that of the arts of painting and sculpture amongst the ancients is not so much the exact imitation of nature as the union in as high a degree as possible of what is beautiful with what is natural  LETTER II  MY LORD  IN the former sheets I have endeavoured to explain to your Lordship the nature of simple recitative and to describe the kind of verse appropriated to it I proceed now to treat of the higher parts of vocal music those namely which are adapted to the more interesting and pathetic passages of the drama With respect to  these distinctions have been likewise made by the Italians which seem perfectly well founded They must in the first place have observed that all those passages in which the mind of the speaker is agitated by a rapid succession of various emotions are from their nature incompatible with any particular strain or length of melody for that which constitutes such particular strain is the relation of several parts to one whole Now it is this whole which the Italians distinguish by the name of  motivo  which may be translated  strain  or  subject of the air  and which they conceive to be inconsistent with the brevity and desultory sense of those ejaculations which are  the effect of a high degree of agitation Air they think even inadmissible in those passages in which though the emotions be not various yet the sentences are broken and incoherent To give an instance The following speech tho' terror be uniformly expressed by the whole of it seems not at all a subject fit to be comprehended under or expressed by one regular strain  Bring me unto my trial when you will  Dy'd he not in his bedWhere should he die  Oh torture me no moreI will confess  Alive againthen shew me where he is  I'll give a thousand pounds to look on him  He hath no eyesthe dust hath blinded them  Comb down his hairlook look it stands upright  Like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul  Give me some drink c  SHAKESPEARE's  Henry  VI  But whilst the Italians conceived such passages to be incompatible with that regularity of measure and that unity of strain which is essential to air they felt however that they were of all others the most proper subject for musical expression And accordingly both the poet and musician seem by mutual consent to have bestowed on such passages their chief study and the musician in particular never fails to exert on them his highest and most  brilliant powers It is to them they adapt that species of recitative termed  recitativo instrumentato  or  recitativo obligatoaccompanied recitative  In this kind of recitative the singer is in a more special manner left to the dictates of his own feelings and judgment with respect to the measure He must not indeed reverse the natural prosody of the language by making short what should be long or  vice versa  but he may not only proportionally lengthen the duration of each syllable but he may give to particular syllables what length he pleases and precipitate considerably the pronunciation of others just as he thinks the expression requires The march of the  notes is very different in this from that of the common or simple recitative delicacy pathos force dignity according to the different expressions of the words are its characteristics It is in this species of song that the finest effects of the chromatic and as far as our system of musical intervals is susceptible of it even of the enharmonic scale are peculiarly felt and it is here also that the powers of modulation are most happily because most properly employed by changes of tone analogous to the variety of the matter in a wonderful manner enforcing and characterizing the transitions which are made from one subject or emotion to another Here too the whole orchestra  lends its aid nor are the instruments limited to the simple duty of supporting and directing the voice In this high species of recitative it is the peculiar province of the instrumental parts during those pauses which naturally take place between the bursts of passion which a mind strongly agitated breaks into to produce such sounds as serve to awake in the audience sensations and emotions similar to those which are supposed to agitate the speaker Here again another fine distinction is made by the Italians between the descriptive and the pathetic powers of music These last are proper to the voice the former to the orchestra alone Thus the symphonies which accompany this  kind of recitative besides the general analogy they must have to the immediate sentiments and even to the character of the speaker are often particularly descriptive of the place in which he is or of some other concomitant circumstance which may serve to heighten the effect of the speech itself Suppose for example the scene to be a prison the symphonies whilst they accord with the general tenor of the words will paint if I may be allowed the expression the horrors of the dungeon itselfAnd I can assure your Lordship that I have heard symphonies of this kind strongly expressive of such horrors Again suppose the scene by moon light and the general tone of  the passion plaintive the sweetness the serenity and though to those who have never experienced the effects of music in this degree it may seem paradoxical to say so even the solitude nay the silence of the scene would make part of the ideas suggested by the symphonies Should a storm be introduced the skilful composer would contrive to make the rain beat and the tempest howl most fearfully by means of the orchestra Nay in a scene such as that of the dying Beaufort which I have quoted above  Page  to your Lordship the musician following close the wild ravings of the speaker would during the pauses of the  speech call forth from the instruments such sounds as would thrill with terror the audience by realizing in a manner to their sense and feeling the horrible apprehensions of his distracted mind But the combined powers of melody and harmony are never more effectually felt than when in this kind of recitative they are employed to mark some very striking transition In a scene of madness for example where the imagination of the speaker is supposed to start from a gloomy desart to flowery meads the orchestra would by an immediate change of measure of melody of harmony perhaps of sounds too mark the transitionwould proceed to spread out the smiling landskip to adorn it with gayest flowers  to awake the zephyr and in short give to the audience by means of a wonderful analogy of sounds the most lively representation of the new image which is supposed to have taken possession of the madman's mindThese are effects of what I have ventured to call the Descriptive or Imitative powers of music With respect to the transitions of passion such as from tenderness to jealousy from joy to anger c these belong to the Pathetic powers of music and are the peculiar province of the vocal part Often in the middle of a very agitated Recitative on the occurrence of some tender idea on which the mind is supposed to dwell with a kind of melancholy pleasure  the music loses by degrees the irregular character of Recitative and resolves gradually into the even measure and continued melody of Airthen on a sudden at the call of some idea of an opposite nature breaks off again into its former irregularity This change from Recitative to Air and thence to Recitative again never fails when properly introduced to have a very striking and beautiful effect Whilst it is the business of the orchestra thus closely to accompany the sentiments and situation of the singer the actor in his turn as there is no note without a meaning must be continually attentive to the orchestra During those intervals in which the instruments may be  said to speak his action must be in strick concert with the music every thing must tend to the same point so that the poet the musician the actor must all seem to be informed by one soulIf your Lordship to the natural voice of passion and the proper and graceful expression of action imagines thus united the intrinsic charm of sound itself and the wonderful powers of melody and harmony I hope you will join with me in opinion that the effect produced by such union is much richer much more beautiful much more powerful and affecting than any that can be produced by simple declamation Though in passages of this description the language ought  certainly to rise with the subject yet the verse which is here made use of is of the same kind with that employed in the common Recitative as being that which has the greatest variety and suffers the fewest restrictions and as such the best adapted to the irregular nature of such passagesHaving thus endeavoured to explain to your Lordship the nature of  recitative simple and accompanied  of those distinctions on which they are respectively founded and of the species of verse in which they are written I proceed to treat of Air and of the different kinds of versification which are employed in it As to the principles which direct the choice in adapting particular measures to particular  airs I shall have nothing to say they being exactly the same with those by which the lyric poet adapts the verse to the various subject of an odethe heroic to the grave and sublimethat which still partakes of dignity though rather smooth than grand to the tender and patheticthat which is more violent and unequal to the highly impassioned partsand that which is of the airy dancing kind to the lighter and more lively passages of the piece Distinctions which it may be observed are evidently consequences of the original union of poetry and music  I am well aware that great part of what I have here said of the power of  the Italian music would to many perhaps to most people appear the language rather of enthusiasm than of any thing else Perhaps it partly is so for my own feelings on the authority alone of which I speak may in some degree proceed from enthusiasm Whether this be the case or whether the effects I mention be completely real but take place in consequence of certain sensibilities so partially distributed among mankind that perhaps even the lesser number are susceptible of these effects I do not presume to determine If this last be the case and there is no absurdity in supposing it to be so it is evident however that those who profess so great a degree of sensibility to  the powers of music will be very apt to appear affected and enthusiastic to the rest of mankind who are surely in some degree justified for calling in question the existence of pleasures to which possessing the same organs all in seeming equal perfection they find themselves perfect strangers Whilst on the other hand those who acknowledge the power of music will think they have a complete right to assert the reality of that of which they have so feeling a conviction For my own part I am firmly persuaded that what I have ventured to advance to your Lordship touching the effects of music is not at all exaggerated with respect to the feelings of thousands besides myself  Nay it is my opinion that were musical entertainments arrived to that degree of perfection to which they might be brought they could not fail of producing effects much more powerful than any I ever had an opportunity of experiencing  LETTER III  MY LORD  RECITATIVE and Air may be considered as  genera  in music and the different kinds of each as  species  What I have already had the honour of submitting to your Lordship's perusal on the subject of Recitative may serve partly to explain the nature of Air All those passages where the  transition from one emotion to another is sudden and violent and which therefore can neither on account of their brevity make each a whole of itself nor by reason of their variety be made parts of the same whole are expressed in Recitative Those on the other hand in which one sentiment pervades a whole sentence composed of different parts become proper subjects for Air and indeed every complete musical strain may with great justness be termed a sentence or period in melodyBefore proceeding to speak of the different kinds of Airs it may not be improper to say something of the Symphony by which they are in general preceded This Symphony  is the enunciation by the orchestra of the strain or subject what the Italians call the  motivo  of the Air and when not improperly introduced which it always is when the sense admits not of any pause serves several useful purposesit gives time to the singer to breathe already perhaps fatigued by a long recitativeit often fills up with propriety a natural pause and always finely prepares the audience for what is to come after by enabling them having thus once heard the strain to listen with more intelligence and of consequence with more interest and pleasure to the song Besides the general  use  of the Symphony renders the  omission  of it on particular  occasions beautiful and strikingThus for example at the end of a Recitative or at the beginning of a scene when the audience are expecting as usual the preparatory Symphony to the Air they are suddenly surprised by the violent burst of some impetuous passion which admitted of no possible pause The propriety of having in such a circumstance omitted the Symphony comes forcibly on the mind as  vice versa  the effect of the omission here confirms the propriety of using it where the sense allows it to be introduced Sometimes again the Symphony is omitted in a very different manner tho' with equal propriety When for instance in an accompanied  recitative after a succession of very different emotions some sentiment is supposed to take possession of the mind related to that which is to be the subject of the Air and to which it is afterwards led by a gradation of kindred emotionsThe progress in this case from Recitative to Air is so gentle that the audience frequently find themselves melting into tears at the affecting and continued melody of the Air before they are aware that the Recitative is ended This imperceptible transition is effected sometime by subjecting the recitative itself to musical measure and making the notes of it by degrees take a resemblance to those of the Air At other times  it is brought about by introducing in the instrumental parts during the pauses of the Recitative passages of the strain which is to make the subject of the Air Sometimes by both these means The effect of this gradual transition is always very fine and as your Lordship will observe is in part derived from that habitual distinction which the audience are accustomed to make between Recitative and AirAs to the Airs themselves your Lordship will conceive that they are as various as their subjects These are every possible sentiment affection or passion the expression of which is extended through one sentence of a certain length such sentences as these  I  loveI fear his wrathI mourn her loss  though all proper subjects for musical expression being evidently too short to afford matter for a strain or melody which however simple must still be composed of parts the relations of which to one another and to one whole constitute indeed the essence of such strainThe Air though it must contain at least one complete sentence is not however limited to one alone It is often composed of two sometimes of more parts but these whether related by analogy or by contrast to the principal one must each strictly belong to the same whole The Airs are divided by the Italians into certain classes these classes are  originally founded on real distinctions drawn from the nature of the various affections of the mind but musicians who like other artists are seldom philosophers have distinguished them by names relative to the practice of their own professionThe principal are the following  Aria Cantabile  by preeminence so called as if it alone were Song And indeed it is the only kind of song which gives the singer an opportunity of displaying at once and in the highest degree all his powers of whatever description they be The proper subjects for this Air are sentiments of tenderness  Aria di portamento  a denomination expressive of the carriage as they thus call it of the voice This kind of Air is chiefly composed of long notes such as the singer can dwell on and have thereby an opportunity of more effectually displaying the beauties and calling forth the powers of his voice for the beauty of sound itself and of voice in particular as being the finest of all sounds is held by the Italians to be one of the chief sources of the pleasure we derive from music The subjects proper for this Air are sentiments of dignity  Aria di mezzo caratttre  Your Lordship can be at no loss to understand  this term though I know no words in our language by which I could properly translate it It is a species of Air which though expressive neither of the dignity of this last nor of the pathos of the former is however serious and pleasing  Aria parlante  speaking Air is that which from the nature of its subject admits neither of long notes in the composition nor of many ornaments in the execution The rapidity of the motion of this Air is proportioned to the violence of the passion which is expressed by it This species of Air goes sometimes by the name of  aria di nota e parola  and likewise of  aria agitata    but these are rather subdivisions of the species and relate to the different degrees of violence of the passion expressed  Aria di bravura aria di agilita  is that which is composed  chiefly  indeed too often  merely  to indulge the singer in the display of certain powers in the execution particularly extraordinary agility or compass of voice Though this kind of air may be sometimes introduced with some effect and without any great violation of propriety yet in general the means are here consounded with the end  Rondo  is a term of French origin unknown I believe till of late to the Italian musicians It relates merely to a certain peculiarity in the construction of the song in which the composer after having properly established the subject carries it through a variety of tones every now and then returning to the principal strain or part and always concluding with it  Cavatina  is an expression which likewise relates to the form alone meaning an Air of one part without repetition  These to the best of my remembrance  the classes into which the Italians  divided Air  I shall now say something of each class and in doing so I hope to give your Lordship some idea of the great extent as well as precision of the Italian music and to show that though the names of these classes be evidently taken from circumstances of practice yet these circumstances if properly attended to will be found to be strictly connected with and indeed to originate from distinctions of a higher kind which must have been previously made with respect to the nature of the passions and their effect on utterance and expression Whether the Italian composers in observing these distinctions have been guided by some system or have been merely influenced  by feeling I cannot take upon me to say I am rather however inclined to think that the latter is the case in the first place because I never heard of any such system existing among them and because I have been personally acquainted with several of their finest composers now living that had no idea of it and again because I think that to the want of such a system can be alone attributed the gross deviations which even in the works of their greatest masters are sometimes to be met with from its most obvious and most essential principles  LETTER IV  MY LORD  THE  aria cantabile  is emphatically so called as being the highest species of Song It is that indeed which affords the singer an opportunity of displaying in the execution of it all his powers and skillif he has voice if he has feeling if he has taste if he has fancy if he has sciencehere he has ample scope for the exertion  of them all The subject proper for this air is the expression of tenderness Though this be an expression which always tends to sadness yet the sadness is of that pleasing kind which the mind loves to indulge Thus the memory of pleasures that are past the complaints of a lover absent from his  faithful  mistress and such like are proper themes for this air Hence it arises that the  aria cantabile  whilst it is susceptible of great pathos admits without prejudice to the expression of being highly ornamented for this plain reason that though the sentiments it expresses are affecting they are at the same time such as the mind dwells on with pleasure and it is likewise  for this reason that the subject of the  cantabile  must never border on deep distress nor approach to violent agitation both of which are evidently inconsistent with ornament The motion of this air though not so solemn as that which belongs to still graver subjects is very slow and its constituent notes of consequence proportionally long I say  constituent notes  in order to distinguish those which the singer introduces as ornamental from those which constitute the melody itself These last are in general very few extremely simple in their march and so arranged as to allow great latitude to the skill of the singer The instrumental parts are in this kind of song restricted to  almost nothing for though the accompanyment is of use to the singer because it supports the voice yet ought it to be kept so subordinate to the vocal part as never during the song to become the object of attention The singer who attempts the  cantabile  should be endowed in the first place with a fine voice of the sweet and plaintive kind that the long notes of which this song is composed may of themselves delight the ear He ought to have great sensibility that he may nicely feel and express in an affecting manner the sentiment He should possess besides great taste and fancy highly to ornament the melody and thereby give to it that elegance which  is essential to this kind of song An accurate judgment is likewise necessary to keep his fancy within due bounds and he ought to be a perfect master of the science of counterpoint that he may know precisely what liberties he may take with respect to the harmony of the other parts As the productions of  science  are at least in part justly esteemed by the degree of  utility  which attends them so those of  art  may be by the degree of  pleasure  they afford Now it is the superior degree of pleasure which proceeds from the joint exertion of so many powers of nature and art in the  aria cantabile  that gives to it the preeminence over every other kind of song for your Lordship will  observe that in listening to an air of this description though the mind is all awake to feeling yet are the emotions it experiences of that gentle kind which unfit it neither for the contemplation of beauty nor for the admiration of art on the contrary they serve to dispose it more effectually for both Thus many of the noblest faculties of the mind are gratified at once we judge we admire we feel at the same instant of time and I may even say we are at the same instant sensibly feasted for there is no doubt but there is a charm not only in the harmony of sounds but even in the beauty of sound itself which acts physically on the machine and may  be considered as actually producing a sensual gratification The following are examples of the  cantabile  from Metastasio In the first a lover complaining to his friend of the cruelty of his mistress concludes the recitative by saying  Ma quanto ah tu nol sai quant' è tiranna  But thou knowest not alas how unkind she is  AIR  Jo lo so che il bel sembiante  Un istante oh dio mirai  E mai piu da quell 'istante  Non lasciai di sospirar  I know it who but for a moment beheld that lovely countenance and never from that moment hare ceased to sigh  Jo lo so lo sanno queste  Valli ombrose erme foreste  Che han da me quel nome amato  Imparato a replicar  I know it and these shady vales these solitary woods which have learned from me to repeat her beloved name know it also  In this second a young warrior about to take leave of his weeping mistress thus addresses her  Frena le belle lagrime  Idolo del mio cor  No per vederti piangere  Cara non ò valor  Ah non destarmi almeno  Nuovi tumulti in seno  Bastano i dolci palpiti  Che vi cagiona amor  Cease those gentle tears my soul's idol if I see thee weep my fortitude forsakes me Ah forbear to awake in my bosom new tumults the soft palpitations are sufficient which love causes there already  I have only now to add on the subject of this air that I should be sorry from what I have said of the ornament essential to it to have given rise to an opinion in your Lordship which the general practice of singers is I own  but too apt to confirm namely that the  cantabile  is little else than a string of flourishes originating almost entirely in the caprice of the performer This is very far from being the case Though the melancholy expressed by the  cantabile  be of that soothing kind which the mind loves to indulge and is therefore not incompatible with some exertions of the fancy yet are these exertions clearly limited both with respect to number and quality by the sense of the words some admit of more some of less ornament The expression of tenderness as has been already observed is that which peculiarly characterises this air and just in proportion as this expression is  allied to sentiments of hope or pleasure or tends rather towards sadness and despondency it admits more or less of being ornamentedAs to the exact quantum no precise rules can be givenThis it is evident must always depend on the nice judgment of the performer and it is certain that the greater his feeling and the more correct his taste the more sparing he will be in the application of embellishmentsThose he makes use of will resemble in kind and number not those ornaments which without distinction overload the whole surface of a Gothic building but those with which the Greeks adorned their architecture which in times of the purest taste  were never so many as to disguise in any degree the appearance of simplicity nor so prominent as to disturb the symmetry of the great component parts of the edifice Having mentioned architecture a very striking analogy presents itself to me between the Corinthian order and the  aria cantabile  As in this order it appears evidently to have been the intention of the inventor to unite as far as they are consistent with each other beauty and utility so it seems the object of the  cantabile  to unite in the same manner beauty and expression Thus elegance and refinement are equally the character of bothin both have the  same kind of limitationin the former any thing however beautiful in itself that militated against utility would have been inadmissiblein the latter any ornament however graceful in itself that ran counterto or in the least diminished the expression would be unpardonablefor utility is the first principle of architecture and expression is the great end of music This analogy might be carried a great deal farther but I am afraid I have already exhausted your Lordship's patience  LETTER V  MY LORD  THE second class of Airs to be considered is the  aria di portamento  a term expressive of a certain way of managing the voice It means that the voice must be strongly supported and artfully managed through the long notes of which this air is composed the motion of which is graver than that of any other species In the  cantabile  the notes are also long but their march is in general gradual and gliding Here on the contrary the intervals ought to be bold striking and unexpected In the former the gentle dying awayhere the grand swell of the voice ought to be principally attended to In short pathos and elegance are the characteristics of the  cantabile  grandeur and sublimity of the  portamento  The great object which musicians seem to have had in view in this kind of air is to give full scope to the voice to display in the highest degree its powers and beautiesas the Italians very emphatically express it  "far pompa della voce"  In the general definition of this air I  took notice to your Lordship of the high value which the Italians put on the beauty of voice itself and indeed the effect of a powerful and at the same time harmonious voice in the execution of an air of this kind is such as I believe must be felt before it can be conceived  Every sentiment which proceeds from greatness of mind or that speaks the admiration of what is itself sublime is a proper groundwork for this air The sentiment expressed by it may be accompanied with sensibility but must be calm and undisturbed by passion This being the case your Lordship will see that the subject of the  portamento  is of a nature too serious and important to admit of that degree of ornament which is essential to the  cantabile  Like the Doric order in architecture though it rejects not ornament altogether yet it must owe its effect chiefly to its simplicity and grandeur If your Lordship will allow me in another way to illustrate the specific difference of these two classes I might say that were Venus to sing her mode of song would be the  cantabile  the  portamento  would be that of the Queen of gods and men  Your Lordship will be sensible that though the line between these two classes be distinctly drawn yet they  may more or less partake sometimes of the nature of each other Some sentiments for example of a female lover all gentleness and sensibility may yet be accompanied with a degree of nobleness which if properly felt by the composer may induce him to give a grandeur to the music that will make it partake more than usual of the stile of the  portamento  As on the other hand circumstances may be imagined in which the most heroic sentiments from the mixture of some tender affection may without losing their dignity be expressed by strains somewhat more approaching to the  cantabile  than the general character of the air allows But these indeed are  nice shades of distinction which escape the controul of fixed rules and can be appretiated only by correspondent feelings The peculiar qualities necessary for the proper performance of this air are first of all a powerful and beautiful voice for without this no skill no taste no feeling even can ever render long notes supportable much less make them a source of delight Secondly a clear and unequivocal pronunciation by virtue of which notwithstanding the length of the notes the articulations with which they began may be so strongly impressed on the memory as to render the sense easily followed and understood Lastly A graceful manner of acting without  which in that kind of  "action soutenue"  which the great length of the notes requires the deportment of the actor must indeed be aukward in the extreme  I proceed now to give your Lordship some examples of these airs beginning with one of the most serious kind and by its nature the farthest removed from the  cantabile  It is likewise taken from MetastasioIn the Oratorio of  the passion of Christ  Dovunque il guardo giro  Immenso Dio te vedo  Nell' opre tue l'ammiro  Te reconosco in me  Where'er I turn my eyes Great God I see thee I revere thee in thy works I feel thee in myself  La terra il mar le sfere  Mostran il tuo potere  Tu sei per tutto e noi  Tutti viviamo in te  The earth the sea the heavens shew forth thy power thou art over all and we all live in thee  The following example is from the opera of Attilius Regulus by the same author It is put in the mouth of the Roman Consul on hearing Regulus insist on being sent back to Carthage  Oh qual fiamma di glorià e d'onore  Sento scorrer per tutte le vene  Alma grande parlando con te  Oh What a flame of glory and honour I feel run through every vein thou great soul in conversing with thee  No non vive si timido core  Che in udirti con quelle catene  Non cambiasse la sorte d'un re  No there lives not a soul so vile who hearing thee would not exchange with these chains even the fortune of a monarch  Here is a third from the same operaThe daughter of Regulus seeing her father so much occupied by the great  public object he had in view that he appears dead to that paternal fondness which she had before experienced from him says  Ah father Why are you so much changed  To which he answers closing the recitative  My fortunes are changedI am still the same  AIR  Non perdo la calma  Fra i ceppi o gli allori  Non va sino ali' alma  La mia servitu  Whether bound in chains or encircled with laurels I lose not my serenity my servitude reaches not the soul  Combatte i rigori  Di forte incostante  In vario sembiante  L'istessa virtu  The same virtue under different appearances combats the rigour of inconstant fortune  LETTER VI  MY LORD  THE  aria di mezzo carattere  comes next to be considered The subjects proper for this kind of air are many and very different its particular character being neither the pathetic the grand nor the passionate but the pleasing There may be an almost infinite variety of sentiments very pretty  and very interesting which are not however of sufficient importance to be made the subject either of the  cantabile  or the  portamento  The  aria di mezzo carattere  comprehends all suchFrom the great variety which this air of consequence embraces as well as from the less emphatic nature of the sentiments to which it belongs its general expression is not so determined as that of the former closses yet with respect to each individual air the expression is far from being vague or dubious and though some greater latitude be here granted to the fancy of the composer nothing is given to his caprice the sense itself of the words clearly ascertaining in point both of  degree and quality the expression The degree ought to be in exact proportion to the placidity or warmth of the sentiment and its particular cast ought to be regulated by the nature of that passion to which the sentiment is naturally allied for sentiments are but gentler degrees of passion Thus this class of airs whilst it retains its own particular character may by turns have some affinity with almost all the other classes but whilst its latitude is great in respect of variety its limitations with regard to degree are obviousit may be soothing but not sadit may be pleasing but not elevatedit may be lively but not gay The motion of this air is by the Italians  termed  andante  which is the exact medium of musical time between its extremes of slow and quick As the vocal part is never supposed here to be so beautiful and interesting as in the higher classes the orchestra tho' it ought never to cover the voice is not however kept in such subordination to itit is not only allowed to play louder but may be more frequently introduced by itself and may on the whole contribute more to the general effect of the air  This kind of song is admirably well calculated to give repose and relief to the mind from the great degree of attention and with respect to myself at  least I might say agitation excited by the higher and more pathetic parts of the pieceThey possess the true character which belongs to the subordinate parts of a beautiful whole as affording a repose not the effect of a total want of interest but of an interest which they call forth of a different and more placid kind which the mind can attend to with more ease and can enjoy without being exhausted I could wish it were in my power to give here three or four examples of this air the more clearly to evince to your Lordship that this air whilst it retains perfectly its own peculiar character may sometimes approach in its expression the  cantabile  sometimes the  portamento  and  sometimes the  parlante  but having but one volume of Metastasio by me I cannot make that selection of examples which I could wish The following is from the sacred composition of the death of Abel and as your Lordship will observe partakes of the nature of the  cantabile  Abel speaks  Quel buon pastor son io  Che tanto il gregge apprezza  Che per là sua salvezza  Offre se stesso ancor  I am that good shepherd who so loves his flock that in defence of it he offers his own life  Conosco ad una ad una  Le miè dilette agnelle  E riconoscon quelle  Il tenero pastor  I know one by one my pretty little lambs and they in return know each their tender shepherd  LETTER VII  MY LORD  FROM what has been said of the foregoing classes it is evident that none of them are at all calculated to express any emotion which approaches to agitation Their peculiar charasteristics dignity tenderness elegance are suitable to the more temperate and finer feelings their subject in short is sentiment rather than passion  This last however affords yet a very wide field for musical expression and perhaps it is not going too far to say that the more violent the passion the more apt the expression of it is to receive additional energy from the power of music The kind of airs which go under the general denomination of  aria parlante  is that whose peculiar province is to express violent emotions of all kinds As on the one hand the necessary connection between the subject of the  portamento  the  cantabile  and the  aria di mezzo carattere  with the respective length of notes and of consequence slowness of measure which has been mentioned as characteristic of each of these classes  is evident so on the other hand the incompatibility of emotions in any degree violent with slow and deliberate utterance is equally evident The circumstance from which this class takes its denomination being the acceleration of speech common to all emotions whatever of the impetuous kind it comprehends of consequence a vast variety with respect both to quality and degreeIt may be said to take up expression just where the  aria di mezzo carattere  leaves it Some airs of this last class of the liveliest cast may approach indeed so near to some of the  parlante  of the least agitated kind that it might perhaps be difficult to say to which class they belonged but as soon  as the expression begins to be in any degree impetuous the distinction is evident as the degree of passion to be expressed increases the air assumes the name of  aria agitata aria di strepito aria infuriata  Expressions of fear of joy of grief of rage when at all impetuous to their highest and most frantic degress are all comprehended under the various subdivisions of the classTheir rhythm has its peculiar province the effect of this kind of airs depending perhaps chiefly on its powers The instrumental parts are here likewise of great efficacy particularly in the expression of the more violent passions giving by the addition of a great body of sound and by the distinctness  and rapidity of their execution a force and energy to the whole which could never be the effect of a voice alone however flexible however powerful and if it be allowed that the beating of a drum has in consequence of certain principles of sound and rhythm a considerable effect on the mind and that ten drums have a proportionably greater effect than one it must I apprehend be also allowed that sounds more beautiful and as distinct nay infinitely more capable from their duration to mark the rhythm by distinguishing pause from length of note must have a similar effect on the mindfiner however and more powerful in proportion to their superior beauty  accuracy and other advantages The instruments here far from being restricted to the mere support of the voice are called in to cooperate with it in producing one and the same effect but with greater power than that which could be produced by the voice alone  I am well aware it may be objected here that the greater the force of the instruments the more they will be apt to overpower the voice and of consequence to destroy the principal source of expression namely the sense of connection between the words and the notes and perhaps it may not be very easy to convince those who are  not conversant with music how it is possible this should not be the case All those however who have been accustomed to hear good music well performed will be satisfied on recollection that in this kind of airs they have often heard a very numerous orchestra exert all its powers without in the least covering the voice or disguising the sense And the reason is simply this that what is called the  "fortissimo"  or extreme force of the orchestra is not continued uniformly throughout the accompanyment which would indeed have the effect of completely drowning the voicebut that this extreme exertion is instantaneously called forth either in those particular  notes which are peculiarly significant of the rhythm such as the first of the bar c or on some note or notes where the sense itself requires it after which the  piano  or  hush  of the orchestra immediately takes place bearing the voice excepting in such instantaneous lightnings of sound if I may be allowed the expression eminently superior throughout nor ever playing for any length of time with the same continued or with increasing force excepting in the case of some climax in the expression where the words have either been already heard or in which at least their sense even were they not distinctly heard cannot from the general tenor of the air be mistaken  This extraordinary swell from all the parts of the orchestra is in general practised with great success at the conclusion of such airs in which supposing the words even not to be understood any further than they can be guessed at from the context and by the action of the speaker the effect they are intended to have on the audience is more happily obtained than it could be by the clear articulation of them unaccompanied by that torrent of passion if I may so speak which may be produced by this united exertion of all the instrumental partsFor it must be likewise observed that passion when very violent is expressed not so much by the words of the speaker  as by other signsthe tones of the voice the acton of the face and the gesture insomuch that I am confident I have heard many airs of this kind in which had the actor without speaking a note looked and acted his part with propriety nobody would have been at a loss to judge either of the kind or of the degree of passion by which he seemed actuated Rousseau somewhere in his works makes a very ingenious observation the truth of which the Italian composers seem evidently to have seltThat as violent passion has a tendency to choak the voice so in the expression of it by musical sounds a  roulade  which is a regular succession of notes up or down or both rapidly  pronounced on one vowel has often a more powerful effect than distinct articulationSuch passages are sometimes introduced in airs of this kind and though I cannot help giving my assent to Rousseau's observation yet I must at the same time confess that they are too apt to be abused and that if continued for any length of time they have always appeared to me unnatural Upon the whole I hope however it must be evident even to those who are not conversant with music that in the expression of the more violent passions the instrumental parts my have a greater latitude than in other kinds of airs in which the emotions being more moderate the expression  of them depends proportionally more on the force of the words and less on the tone and action with which they are accompanied But whatever may be the effect of airs of this kind when properly led by the circumstances of the piece and explained by the character of the speaker your Lordship must see with what impropriety they are introduced as is frequently the case in our concerts where without the audience being apprised either of the interest of the piece or the nature of the characters they are sung by a fellow standing bolt upright with one hand in his side and the other in his breechespocket and where into the bargain the unmerciful scrapers of our  orchestra taking the advantage of the  fortissimo  which they find now and then written above the notes of their parts seem to vie with one anothers who shall most effectually overpower throughout both the voice of the singer and the melody of the song It is this kind of ignorant selection and murderous execution which give sensible people a distaste to Italian music in general nor can they surely be blamed for thinking it absurd that a man should say what cannot in the nature of things be heard and that all that violent fracas and noise of instruments is a most ridiculous accompanyment to the affected immobility and unmeaning simper of the singer  But to return to the subjectyour Lordship will perceive that between those most violent expressions and those that are least so which this class comprehends there must be an almost infinite variety in respect both of kind and degree I shall therefore content myself with giving your Lordship examples of the principal divisions only and shall begin by that kind which I mentioned before as taking up expression where the  aria di mezzo carattere  leaves it and as being of this nature that it might even be sometimes difficult to decide which of these classes it belonged to  Del sen gli ardori  Nessun mi vanti  Non soffro amori  Non voglio amanti  Troppo miè cara  La libertà  Let no one boast to me the ardours of his bosom I suffer not loves I am adverse to lovers my liberty is too dear to me  Se fosse ognuno  Cosi sincero  Meno importune  Sarrebbe il vero  Saria pui rara  L' infedeltà  If every one were as sincere truth would be less offensive and infidelity more rare  If the words of this air were put in the mouth of a gay young girl thus carefully signifying her insensibility to  ove and her desire of liberty it might with propriety be so composed as to rank with the Airs  di mezzo carattere  and would be well expressed by that pleasing though unimpassioned cantileno which is characteristic of that class But if on the other hand we suppose them spoken with a degree of earnestness to an importunate lover in order to get rid of him it must in that case certainly be so composed as to belong to the first division of the  aria parlante  In the following example no such uncertainty can take place the degree of passion or of interest at least expressed by it referring it plainly to this last class Achilles speaks it about to leave Deidamia  Dille che si consoli  Dille che m' ami e dille  Che parti fido Achille  Che fido tornerà  Tell her to be comforted tell her to love me and tell her that Achilles left her faithful that faithful he will return  Che a suol bei occhi soli  Fia che 'l mio cor si stempre  Che l' idol mio fù sempre  Che l' idol mio farà  That her charms alone shall have the sovereignty of my heart that she ever was that she ever shall be my only love  In order to be as explicit as possible I shall give your Lordship two other examples from the same piece which with regard to the expression seem nearly equal in degree though widely different in kindDeidamia reproaching Achilles for want of affection says  No ingrato amor non senti  O se pur senti amore  Perder non vuoi del cor▪  Por me la pace  No ungrateful thou feelest not love or if indeed thou feelest it thou art not willing for my sake to lose the peace of thy bosom  Amai se te 'l rammenti  E puoi senza penar  Amare e disamar  Quando ti piace  Perhaps thou lovest but remember thou can'st not love and without pain cease to love at pleasure  The other is put in the mouth of Achilles on his suspicion of being deprived of his raistress by a rival  Il volarmi il mio tesoro  Ah dov' è quest' alma ardita  A da togliermi la vita  Che vuol togliermi il mio ben  Rob me of my treasure Ah where is this  presumptuous soul He must first take my life who would rob me of my love  M' avvilisce in queste spoglie  Il poter di due pupille  Ma lo so ch'io sono Achille  Ma mi sento Achille in sen  The power of too bright eyes disgraces me in these weeds but I knowI feel that I am Achilles  Though the general acceleration of speech common to each of these Airs and which therefore brings them under the same class be perhaps nearly equal in both yet the skilful composer will nicely discriminate not only between the warlike audacity of Achilles  and the feminine softness of Dudanio but also between the expression of disappointed affection in the former and of jealous resentment in the latter  I beg leave to offer the two following examples also as approaching in degree to the foregoing though very different in kind the first partaking somewhat of the tenderness which is characteristic of the  cantabile  the second of the dignity which belongs to the  portamento  Parto non ti sdegnar  Si madre mia da te  Gli affetti a moderar  Quest' alma impara  I go be not offended yes my mother I go this soul shall learn from thee to moderate its affections  Gran Colpa pur non è  Se mal frenar si pŭò  Un figlio che perdè  Un figlio che trovò  Si cara madre  Surely it is no heinous fault that a son cannot easily command himself who lost who found so dear a mother  In the following Air Xerxes on being reconciled to Themistocles thus addresses him  Contrasto assai piú degno  Se vuoi comincierà  Or che la gloria in noi  L'odio in amor cambio  A much nobler combat if thou wilt shall commence betwixt us now that glory has changed our hatred into love  Scordati tu lo sdegno  Jo le vendette obblio  Tú mio sostegno ed io  Tuo difensor saro  Forget there thy enmity I will bury in oblivion my resentment thou shalt be my support I will be thy protector  In the following examples the violence of the expression being increased the music assumes the denomination of  aria agitata  L'alma delira  Par che manchino  Quasi i respiri  Che fuor del petto  Mi balza il cor  My soul grows delirious with excessive joy I pant for breath my heart seems to jump from my bosom  Quant' è piu facile  Ch'un gran diletto  Giunga ad uccidere  Che un gran dolor  How much more apt is excess of joy to kill than excess of grief  I cannot pass by this example however without observing to your Lordship  that the second part of the Air is by no means proper for musical expression It ceases to be the language of passion and is besides a reflection which no person in such a state as the first part indicates would naturally make In setting the Opera to Music a judicious composer would strike it out altogether The next example though evidently different with regard to the kind of expression belongs to the same subdivision of this class  Gia l'idea del giusto scempio  Mi rapisce mi diletta  Gia pensando alla vendetta  Mi commincio a vendicar  Already the idea of the just slaughter delights me already thinking of my vengeance I begin to be revenged  Gia quel barbaro quel empio  Fa di sangue il suol vermiglio  Ed il sangue del mio figlio  Gia si sente rin facciar  I see the impious wretch already dye the earth with his blood already the murder of my son stares him in the face  The examples I am next to give your Lordship are of that kind which takes the name of  aria di smanie  for which I do not recollect any phrase in English exactly equivalent It is an appellation given to the expression of such emotions as take away in some  degree the right use of reason and begin to border on insanity  Non vedi tiranno  Ch' io moro d'affanno  Che bramo che in pace  Mi lasci morir  Seest thou not tyrant that I die of grief and only wish thou wouldst suffer me to die in peace  Ch'o l'alma si oppressa  Che tutto mi spiace  Che quasi me stessa  Non posso soffrir  That my soul is so oppressed that every thing is hateful to me that I can no longer suffer even myself  Dimmi crudel dov' è  Ah non tacer cosi  Barbaro Ciel perchè  Infino a questo di  Serbarmi in vita  Tell me cruelWhere is she Ah do not thus be silent barbarous Heaven Ah Why didst thou prolong my life to this day  CorrasiAh dove oh Dei  Chi guida e passi miei  Chi almen chi per mercè  La via m' addita  Let me runWhere oh God Who will guide my steps who for pity's sake will direct me  RECITATIVE  Fuggi Sebaste ah dove  Faggiro da me stesso ah porto in seno  Il carnefice mio dovunque vada  Il terror lo spavento  Seguiran la mia traccia  La colpa mia mi starà sempre in faccia  Fly Sebasteah whither shall I fly from myself Alas I carry in my bosom my executioner wherever I go horror follows my steps my guilt must ever stare me in the face  AIR  Aspri remorsi atroci  Figli del fallo mio  Perche si tardi oh Dio  Mi lacerate il cor  Cruel heartrending remorse offspring of my crime Why oh God so late dost thou tear my bosom  Perche funeste voci  Ch'or mi sgridate appresso  Perche vi ascolto adesso  Ne v'ascoltar fin or  Ye fatal voices which now howl around me if deaf to you hitherto why do I listen to you now  The last division of this class of airs is that which is adapted to the expression of passion of whatever kind when become frantic and is properly termed  aria infuriata  RECITATIVE  Non piŭ Mandane  Il mio furor mi avanza  Non ispirarmi il tuo fremo abbastanza  No more Mandane inspire me not with thine my own fury is sufficient  AIR  Men bramosa di stragi funeste  Va scorrendo l'Armene foreste  Fera tigre che i figli perdè  With less thirst for blood and slaughter the fierce tyger robbed of its young scours the Armenian forests  Ardo d'ira di rabbia deliro  Smanio fremo non odo non miro  Che le furie che porto con me  My wrath consumes me I rave I rage I hear and see nothing but the furies which I carry with myself  Rendimi il figlio mio  Ah Mi si spezza il cor  Non son piu madre oh Dio  Non ò piu figlio  Give me back my sonoh my heart burstsno longer am I a motheroh God my child is no more  Fra mille furori  Che calma non anno  Fra mille timori  Che intorno mi stanno  Accender mi sento  Mi sento gelar  Surrounded by a thousaud furies which know no calm by a thousand terrors which incessantly pursue me by turns I freeze I burn  I hope I have been able by the foregoing examples to give your Lordship some idea of the nature extent and variety of this class of airs as well as of the reason why so great a variety is comprehended under the same general denomination a circumstance which without due attention to its cause would appear absurd and contradictory Before I conclude it is proper to take notice to your Lordship that the words of an air may be so written as to afford subject for two or even three of the classes hitherto  mentioned not in a mixed manner but severally of which my memory furnishes me with the following example  Pria ch'io rieda al campo  Pensa ch'io son Romano  Che d'una spada il lampo  No non mi fa terror  Before I return to the camp remember I am a Roman that I rejoice in danger of battle  Sposa Signor che affanno  Deh tergi i vaghi rai  Che sol nel dirti addio  Vacilla il mio valor  SpouseSirwhat miseryfor pity's  sake dry up these tears only in bidding thee adieu my constancy is shaken  Empio destin tiranno  O cento smanie in seno  O cento furie al cor  Cruel barbarous fate a thousand torments rend my bosom I have a thousand furies in my heart  This air your Lordship sees is divided into three different parts the first of which expressing dignity of sentiment belongs to the  portamento  the second expressing tenderness to the  cantabile  and the third expressing rage to the last division of the  aria parlante  LETTER VIII  MY LORD  FROM what I have said of the  aria di portamento  the  cantabile  the  mezzo carattere  and the different subdivisions of the  aria parlante  I hope I have in some degree made it plain to your Lordship that there is no affection of the human breast from the slightest and most gentle stirring of sentiment to the most frantic degrees of  passion which some one of these classes is not aptly suited to express If this be true other classes must be either bad or superfluous This in fact is the case of the  aria di agilità  or  aria di bravura  as it is sometimes called in treating of which it will be almost sufficient to repeat to your Lordship the description I gave of it in the general enumeration of the different classes It is an air composed  chiefly  indeed too often  merely  to indulge the singer in the display of certain powers in the execution particularly extraordinary agility or compass of voice In such a composition the  means  are evidently confounded with the  end  of the art dexterity if I may be allowed  the expression and artifice instead of serving as the instruments being made the object of the work Such are the airs which with us we so frequently observe sung to ears erect and gaping mouths whilst the heart in honest apathy is carrying on its mere animal function And of this kind indeed are all the attempts in the different arts to substitute what is difficult or novel for what is beautiful and natural Where there has ever been a genuine taste for any of the arts this aptness to admire what is new and difficult is one of the first symptoms of the decline of that taste such is at present the case in Italy with respect to all the arts but the admiration bestowed  in Britain on difficulty and novelty in preference to beauty and simplicity is the effect not of the decline but of the total want of taste and proceeds from the same principles with the admiration of tumbling and ropedancing which the multitude may gaze on with astonishment long before they are susceptible of the charms of graceful and elegant pantomime these feats of agility having exactly the same relation to fine dancing that the above mentioned airs have to expressive music They are therefore I conceive incompatible with the nature of a serious drama but in the burletta or comic opera in which much greater liberties may be taken I think I have  sometimes heard them introduced with success In a comedy a pretty frolicsome coquette may be supposed to cut an elegant caper at once to show her legs and to display her skill in dancing nay such a stroke might be characteristic and therefore proper So a gay fashionable lady might with a kind of graceful levity express by an air of this kind some of her pretty capricious humours equally unintelligible with the music itself the merit of both consisting merely in the prettiness of the  manner  for this kind of music tho' incapable of any expression excepting that perhaps of gaiety in general may yet have all the beauty which can be given to it by a fine voice running  with ease and velocity though an arrangment of notes not in itself unpleasing just as the humour of the lady though perhaps rather unmeaning may be accompanied with many graces of countenance figure voice and motion  Now the union of all this with the music produces often without any violation of propriety a very happy effect on the stage but your Lordship will observe with what absurd impropriety these airs often make a part of our concerts where all this elegant flirtation of face and figure is forbidden and where these fanciful and exuberant sallies are gravely pronounced  by a lady standing at the harpsicord with downcast or at best unmeaning eyes and without the smallest apparent tendency to motion  LETTER IX  MY LORD  Have now endeavoured to give your Lordship as distinct an idea as I could of the simple and accompanied Recitative and of all those classes of Airs which have names in Italian and which I mentioned in the first general enumeration I made of them There is however another species of Airs which I have not classed with  them because it has no particular denomination though it appears to me well deserving of that distinction But this is easily accounted for when it is considered as I took occasion to observe in the beginning that the names of these classes are all taken from circumstances of the practical part of the art The Airs alluded to here are those whose subject is a simile and which I shall venture to call Airs of Imitation These though essentially different from all those before mentioned yet from some circumstance of similarity in the practical part have been referred to one or other of the above classes  Though upon the whole similes of any length be perhaps seldom admissible in dramatic poetry being in general repugnant to the genuine expression of passion yet sometimes they may be introduced without impropriety more particularly in the musical drama which like all the other arts justly claims some license in practice with respect to that beauty which is its chief object or that species of pleasure which it is peculiarly calculated to inspire  Now the greatest possible variety of musical effect being exactly the perfection of this kind of drama and those Airs which have for their subject a simile by giving scope to the descriptive  powers of Music being a source of great beauty and variety to the piece a more frequent introduction of similes may on this principle be allowed in the opera than in dramatic works unaccompanied by music Before I proceed to give your Lordship any examples of this Air I beg leave to say something on the principle of Musical Imitation in general And first it is evident that besides the relations of acute and grave of loud and soft of continuous and discontinuous which are simply the same in noise of all kinds as in musical sounds there are many circumstances of resemblance between these last and other sounds for some of which we have not even names The  found of a little flute for example resembles the singing of birds not from its shrillness merely but on account of a certain quality of sound common to both which every ear is sensible of but which we have no words to express It is by this quality of sound that we distinguish the voices of persons though speaking perhaps nearly on the same pitch and discriminate different instruments while playing the same musical notes and the Italians have therefore very properly termed it  il metallo della voce  Again motion in bodies though not common to motion in music in all its extent is in some respects the same in others similar or at least analogous Slow and quick with regard  to succession with all the possible degrees between their perceptible extremes are common to both The same may be said of regular and irregular and where these fail analogies can be affected by different means as striking as circumstances of positive fameness or resemblance Gliding as it is sometimes practised both by the voice and by certain instruments is the same in music as in bodies it being in reality the effect of that motion in some body acting on another The notes of music however being each by its nature stationary cannot strictly speaking be said to glide yet the idea of a gliding motion is easily conveyed by a certain arrangement of notes  In the same manner soaring sinking and even level motion are equally easily expressed and though to be sure a note cannot be said to turn or run round like a body yet a succession of notes may be found that may give an idea of circular motion the difference between these motions in music and in bodies being something like the difference between these circles  Setting aside then the more obscure analogies in music which are felt perhaps only in consequence of a certain  organization or a degree of imagination not common to all men it is surely evident that resemblances or analogies may be produced by means of sounds and of their rythm and arrangement to every thing in nature which we perceive in consequence of sound and motion Thus the whistling of the winds the noise of thunder the roaring and dashing of the sea the murmurs of a stream the whispers of the breezethe solemn waving of a lofty pine the forked motion and momentary appearance of lightning the grand swell of a billow the rapidity of a torrent the meanders of a rivulet or the smooth gliding of a silent stream must even to those who have not a  musical ear appear all within the compass of musical imitation for this plain reason that positive resemblance is in fact the ground of this imitation Nor does the analogy seem much strained when we say that music may imitate the tread of a giant the light and nimble footsteps of a nymph or even the motion of those fanciful beings whom Shakespeare has described as  "chasing with printless feet the ebbing Neptune"  But the imitation of which music is capable is not stinted to such positive resemblances as those now cited general ideas of hugeness and immensity of lightness and elegance of operations that are performed with difficulty or with facility of order  of confusion of exertion of repose of energy of debility of similarity of discrepancy of union of incompatibility and many more may be clearly conveyed by different qualities modifications arrangements rythm and combinations of musical sounds With respect to the more distant and obscure analogies such as that to cold light darkness pain and the like as to those who are less sensible of the effects of music they may seem to originate rather in the enthusiasm of the hearer than in any reality in the art I shall not insist on them  I hope upon the whole your Lordship will agree with me that it is evident  that there are sufficient grounds to go upon to justify the attempt of imitative music as distinct from passionate and that the introduction of airs of this last kind must in consequence of the variety they give tend to beautify the whole and render it more complete I must confess however that I have often seen them used too frequently in the same piece and that the effect of them can never be completely fine when they are not dictated by and accompanied throughout with some sentiment or passion of the speakerThe following is an example in point  RECITATIVE  In ogni sorte  L'istessa è la virtù l'agita è vero  Il nemico destin ma non I'opprime  E quando e men felice è piu sublime  In every state virtue is the same adverse fate it is true agitates but cannot oppress it and when it is least happy it is then most sublime  AIR  Quercia annosa su l'erte pendici  Fra il contrasto di venti nemici  Pin secura piu salda fi fa  The knotted oak which high on the rugged cliffs braves the contending winds becomes by them more firm and more secure  Che s'el verno di chiome le sfronda  Piu nel suolo col piè si profonda  Forza aquista se perde belta  And if the winter despoils it of its leaves it makes it sink deeper in the earth its roots and it acquires strength in proportion as it loses beauty  In the foregoing example the image of the oak itself on the high cliffs the raging of the winds and the dignity of the sentiment in the speaker all conspire to produce the same effect of grandeur But I have seen airs in which the subject of the passionate part was different from that of the imitative so contrived as to keep each most distinctly separate from the other whilst  at the same time the union of both made one beautiful whole Handel in his Oratorio of Acis and Galatea has produced a masterstroke of this kindGalatea addressing herself to the birds that are supposed to be singing around her says  Hush hush ye little warbling quire  Your thrilling strains  Awake my pains  And kindle fierce desire  In this example there is no comparison made the imitative part is only suggested by the sense and the composer has taken the hint in adapting the music to it and has indeed done  it with the utmost propriety as well as ingenuity It is plain in this air that if the imitation of any thing is to be at all attempted it must be that of the warbling quire And it is as plain that the passionate expression of the speaker has not even the most distant relation to the singing of birdsto have set the voice a singing in imitation of the birds or whilst the voice sang the passionate part to have made the birds sing either in unison or in direct harmony with the voice would have been each equally absurd It would seem indeed at first sight almost impossible to reconcile two things so different yet this great genius by confining each part to its proper  province has so artfully managed the composition that whilst the vocal part most feelingly speaks the passion a little flagellet from the orchestra carries on throughout the delightful warbling of the quire and though perfectly different in sound melody and rythm from the notes sung by the voice instead of distracting the attention from it or confounding the expression serves to add new beauty and grace to the effect just as your Lordship may conceive a naked figure so veiled with some light and transparent vestment floating to the wind as at once completely to reveal the figure and by its undulating folds add new charms both to the motion and the  form Nothing can put in a stronger light the discrimination which I before made to your Lordship of the passionate and imitative powers of music than the above mentioned air or more clearly evince the propriety of assigning the first to the voice alone and of confining the instruments to the other only This principle indeed long before it was perhaps ever thought of either by philosophers or composers must have been generally felt and even the powers of the great Handel could not compensate its violation in composition for in the very same opera a little after when Galatea is made to convert Acis into a stream and after the symphony has made a  fine imitation of the winding of the stream through the vale he makes Galatea repeat it with her voice and though the music of the air be in other respects beautiful in the extreme yet I do not believe it was ever performed without appearing tedious even to those who never dreamed of this principle and to those who were acquainted with it at once tedious and absurd  In the first example I gave your Lordship of these airs of imitation the comparison is itself the subject and the nature of the sentiment coinciding perfectly with it only serves to increase perhaps the general pathos without  forming in any degree a separate subjectThe second contains plainly a double subject contrived with wonderful art to go on together to set off each other and to form one beautiful whole There is still a third kind of these airs that holds a middle place between those two in which there being no express comparison the imitative part as in the last is only suggested by the words but being as in the first of the same quality as it were with the sentiment does not make the immediate subject of the music but is kept subordinate to the expression of the passion or sentiment The following air is of this species  Intendo amico rio  Quel basso mormorio  Tu chiedi in tua favella  Il nostro ben dov' è  I understand thee gentle river in that plaintive murmur thou inquirest with me where our love is gone  As the comparisons which make the subject of these airs or as the objects of which they only suggest the imitation may be sublime elegant gay boisterous c so they may severally have a relation to some one or other of the classes before mentioned the  portamento  the  cantabile  the  mezzo carattere  and the different divisions of the  aria parlante  and of consequence  may be referred to them the division which I have made of music into passionate and imitative being rather of a philosophical kind whilst that by which the Italians have formed the different classes of their airs originates as I have said in circumstances of practice only So just is their division that to give a distinct idea of any of these airs we must say it is an air of imitation of the  portamento  stile or of the  cantabile  c  FINIS
