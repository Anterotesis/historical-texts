SEVERAL OCCASIONS WRITTEN BY D  R  THOMAS PARNELL LATE ARCHDEACON OF CLOGHER AND PUBLISH'D BY M  R  POPE  DIGNUM LAUDE VIRUM MUSA VETAT MORI  HOR  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBERT EARL OF OXFORD AND EARL MORTIMER  SUCH were the notes thy once lov'd Poet sung  'Till death untimely stop'd his tuneful tongue  O just beheld and lost admir'd and mourn'd  With softest manners gentlest arts adorn'd  Blest in each science blest in ev'ry strain  Dear to the Muse to HARLEY dearin vain  FOR him thou oft hast bid the world attend  Fond to forget the statesman in the friend  For SWIFT and him despis'd the farce of state  The sober follies of the wise and great  Dextrous the craving fawning crowd to quit  And pleas'd to 'scape from flattery to wit  ABSENT or dead still let a friend be dear  A sigh the absent claims the dead a tear  Recall those nights that clos'd thy toilsome days  Still hear thy PARNELL in his living lays  Who careless now of int'rest fame or fate  Perhaps forgets that OXFORD e'er was great  Or deeming meanest what we greatest call  Beholds thee glorious only in thy fall  And sure if ought below the seats divine  Can touch immortals 'tis a soul like thine  A soul supreme in each hard instance try'd  Above all pain all anger and all pride  The rage of pow'r the blast of public breath  The lust of lucre and the dread of death  IN vain to desarts thy retreat is made  The muse attends thee to the silent shade  'Tis her's the brave man's latest steps to trace  Rejudge his acts and dignify disgrace  When int'rest calls off all her sneaking train  When all th' oblig'd desert and all the vain  She waits or to the scaffold or the cell  When the last ling'ring friend has bid farewel  Ev'n now she shades thy evening walk with bays  No hireling she no prostitute to praise  Ev'n now observant of the parting ray  Eyes the calm sunset of thy various day  Thro' fortune's cloud one truly great can see  Nor fears to tell that MORTIMER is he  SEPT  A POPE  THE CONTENTS

OR THE RISE OF WOMAN  WHAT antient times those times we fancy wise  Have left on long record of Woman's rise  What morals teach it and what fables hide  What author wrote it how that author dy'd  All these I sing In Greece they fram'd the tale  In Greece 'twas thought a Woman might be frail  Ye modern beauties where the poet drew  His softest pencil think he dreamt of you  And warn'd by him ye wanton pens beware  How Heav'n's concern'd to vindicate the fair  The case was Hesiod's he the fable writ  Some think with meaning some with idle wit  Perhaps 'tis either as the ladies please  I wave the contest and commence the lays  In days of yore no matter where or when  'Twas ere the low creation swarm'd with men  That one Prometheus sprung of heav'nly birth  Our author's song can witness liv'd on earth  He carv'd the turf to mold a manly frame  And stole from Jove his animating flame  The sly contrivance o'er Olympus ran  When thus the monarch of the stars began  Oh vers'd in arts whose daring thoughts aspire  To kindle clay with neverdying fire  Enjoy thy glory past that gift was thine  The next thy creature meets be fairly mine  And such a gift a vengeance so design'd  As suits the counsel of a God to find  A pleasing bosomcheat a specious ill  Which felt thy curse yet covet still to feel  He said and Vulcan strait the sire commands  To temper mortar with etherial hands  In such a shape to mold a rising fair  As virgingoddesses are proud to wear  To make her eyes with diamondwater shine  And form her organs for a voice divine  'Twas thus the sire ordain'd the pow'r obey'd  And work'd and wonder'd at the work he made  The fairest softest sweetest frame beneath  Now made to seem now more than seem to breathe  As Vulcan ends the chearful Queen of Charms  Clasp'd the newpanting creature in her arms  From that embrace a fine complexion spread  Where mingled whiteness glow'd with softer red  Then in a kiss she breath'd her various arts  Of trifling prettily with wounded hearts  A mind for love but still a changing mind  The lisp affected and the glance design'd  The sweet confusing blush the secret wink  The gentleswimming walk the courteous sink  The stare for strangeness fit for scorn the frown  For decent yielding looks declining down  The practis'd languish where wellfeign'd desire  Wou'd own its melting in a mutual fire  Gay smiles to comfort April show'rs to move  And all the nature all the art of love  Goldscepter'd Juno next exalts the fair  Her touch endows her with imperious air  Selfvaluing fancy highlycrested pride  Strong sov'reign will and some desire to chide  For which an eloquence that aims to vex  With native tropes of anger arms the sex  Minerva skilful goddess train'd the maid  To twirl the spindle by the twisting thread  To fix the loom instruct the reeds to part  Cross the long weft and close the web with art  An useful gift but what profuse expence  What world of fashions took its rise from hence  Young Hermes next a closecontriving god  Her brows encircled with his serpent rod  Then plots and fair excuses fill'd her brain  The views of breaking am'rous vows for gain  The price of favours the designing arts  That aim at riches in contempt of hearts  And for a comfort in the marriage life  The little pilf'ring temper of a wise  Full on the fair his beams Apollo flung  And fond perswasion tip'd her easy tongue  He gave her words where oily flatt'ry lays  The pleasing colours of the art of praise  And wit to scandal exquisitely prone  Which frets another's spleen to cure its own  Those sacred virgins whom the bards revere  Tun'd all her voice and shed a sweetness there  To make her sense with double charms abound  Or make her lively nonsense please by sound  To dress the maid the decent Graces brought  A robe in all the dies of beauty wrought  And plac'd their boxes o'er a rich brocade  Where pictur'd Loves on ev'ry cover play'd  Then spread those implements that Vulcan's art  Had fram'd to merit Cytherea's heart  The wire to curl the close indented comb  To call the locks that lightly wander home  And chief the mirrour where the ravish'd maid  Beholds and loves her own reflected shade  Fair Flora lent her stores the purpled Hours  Confin'd her tresses with a wreath of flow'rs  Within the wreath arose a radiant crown  A veil pellucid hung depending down  Back roll'd her azure veil with serpent fold  The purfled border deck'd the floor with gold  Her robe which closely by the girdle brac't  Reveal'd the beauties of a slender waste  Flow'd to the feet to copy Venus' air  When Venus' statues have a robe to wear  The newsprung creature finish'd thus for harms  Adjusts her habit practises her charms  With blushes glows or shines with lively smiles  Confirms her will or recollects her wiles  Then conscious of her worth with easy pace  Glides by the glass and turning views her face  A finer flax than what they wrought before  Thro' time's deep cave the Sister Fates explore  Then fix the loom their fingers nimbly weave  And thus their toil prophetic songs deceive  Flow from the rock my flax and swiftly flow  Pursue thy thread the spindle runs below  A creature fond and changing fair and vain  The creature Woman rises now to reign  New beauty blooms a beauty form'd to fly  New love begins a love produc'd to dye  New parts distress the troubled scenes of life  The fondling mistress and the ruling wife  Men born to labour all with pains provide  Women have time to sacrifice to pride  They want the care of man their want they know  And dress to please with heartalluring show  The show prevailing for the sway contend  And make a servant where they meet a friend  Thus in a thousand waxerected forts  A loitering race the painful bee supports  From sun to sun from bank to bank he flies  With honey loads his bag with wax his thighs  Fly where he will at home the race remain  Prune the silk dress and murm'ring eat the gain  Yet here and there we grant a gentle bride  Whose temper betters by the father's side  Unlike the rest that double human care  Fond to relieve or resolute to share  Happy the man whom thus his stars advance  The curse is gen'ral but the blessing chance  Thus sung the Sisters while the gods admire  Their beauteous creature made for man in ire  The young Pandora she whom all contend  To make too perfect not to gain her end  Then bid the winds that fly to breathe the Spring  Return to bear her on a gentle wing  With wafting airs the winds obsequious blow  And land the shining vengeance safe below  A golden coffer in her hand she bore  The present treach'rous but the bearer more  'Twas fraught with pangs for Jove ordain'd above  That gold should aid and pangs attend on love  Her gay descent the man perceiv'd afar  Wond'ring he run to catch the falling star  But so surpriz'd as none but he can tell  Who lov'd so quickly and who lov'd so well  O'er all his veins the wand'ring passion burns  He calls her nymph and ev'ry nymph by turns  Her form to lovely Venus he prefers  Or swears that Venus' must be such as hers  She proud to rule yet strangely fram'd to teize  Neglects his offers while her airs she plays  Shoots scornful glances from the bended frown  In brisk disorder trips it up and down  Then hums a careless tune to lay the storm  And sits and blushes smiles and yields in form  "Now take what Jove design'd she softly cry'd  "This box thy portion and myself thy bride"  Fir'd with the prospect of the double charms  He snatch'd the box and bride with eager arms  Unhappy man to whom so bright she shone  The fatal gift her tempting self unknown  The winds were silent all the waves asleep  And heav'n was trac'd upon the flatt'ring deep  But whilst he looks unmindful of a storm  And thinks the water wears a stable form  What dreadful din around his ears shall rise  What frowns confuse his picture of the skies  At first the creature man was fram'd alone  Lord of himself and all the world his own  For him the nymphs in green forsook the woods  For him the nymphs in blue forsook the floods  In vain the Satyrs rage the Tritons rave  They bore him heroes in the secret cave  No care destroy'd no sick disorder prey'd  No bending age his sprightly form decay'd  No wars were known no females heard to rage  And Poets tell us 'twas a golden age  When Woman came those ills the box confin'd  Burst furious out and poison'd all the wind  From point to point from pole to pole they flew  Spread as they went and in the progress grew  The nymphs regretting left the mortal race  And alt'ring nature wore a sickly face  New terms of folly rose new states of care  New plagues to suffer and to please the fair  The days of whining and of wild intrigues  Commenc'd or finish'd with the breach of leagues  The mean designs of welldissembled love  The sordid matches never join'd above  Abroad the labour and at home the noise  Man's double suff'rings for domestic joys  The curse of jealousy expence and strife  Divorce the public brand of shameful life  The rival's sword the qualm that takes the fair  Disdain for passion passion in despair  These and a thousand yet unnam'd we find  Ah fear the thousand yet unnam'd behind  Thus on Parnassus tuneful Hesiod sung  The mountain echo'd and the valley rung  The sacred groves a fix'd attention show  The chrystal Helicon forbore to flow  The sky grew bright and if his verse be true  The Muses came to give the laurel too  But what avail'd the verdant prize of wit  If Love swore vengeance for the tales he writ  Ye fair offended hear your friend relate  What heavy judgment prov'd the writer's fate  Tho' when it happen'd no relation clears  'Tis thought in five or five and twenty years  Where dark and silent with a twisted shade  The neighb'ring woods a native arbour made  There oft a tender pair for am'rous play  Retiring toy'd the ravish'd hours away  A Locrian youth the gentle Troilus he  A fair Milesian kind Evanthe she  But swelling nature in a fatal hour  Betray'd the secrets of the conscious bow'r  The dire disgrace her brothers count their own  And track her steps to make its author known  It chanc'd one evening 'twas the lover's day  Conceal'd in brakes the jealous kindred lay  When Hesiod wand'ring mus'd along the plain  And fix'd his seat where love had fix'd the scene  A strong suspicion strait possest their mind  For poets ever were a gentle kind  But when Evanthe near the passage stood  Flung back a doubtful look and shot the wood  "Now take at once they cry thy due reward"  And urg'd with erring rage assault the bard  His corps the sea receiv'd The dolphins bore  'Twas all the Gods would do the corps to shore  Methinks I view the dead with pitying eyes  And see the dreams of antient wisdom rise  I see the Muses round the body cry  But hear a Cupid loudly laughing by  He wheels his arrow with insulting hand  And thus inscribes the moral on the sand  "Here Hesiod lies ye future bards beware  "How far your moral tales incense the fair  "Unlov'd unloving 'twas his fate to bleed  "Without his quiver Cupid caus'd the deed  "He judg'd this turn of malice justly due  "And Hesiod dy'd for joys he never knew"  SONG  WHEN thy beauty appears  In its graces and airs  All bright as an angel new dropt from the sky  At distance I gaze and am aw'd by my fears  So strangely you dazzle my eye  But when without art  Your kind thoughts you impart  When your love runs in blushes thro' ev'ry vein  When it darts from your eyes when it pants in your heart  Then I know you're a woman again  There's a passion and pride  In our sex she reply'd  And thus might I gratify both I wou'd do  Still an angel appear to each lover beside  But still be a woman to you  A SONG  THYRSIS a young and am'rous swain  Saw two the beauties of the plain  Who both his heart subdue  Gay Caelia's eyes were dazzling fair  Sabina's easy shape and air  With softer magic drew  He haunts the stream he haunts the grove  Lives in a fond romance of love  And seems for each to die  'Till each a little spiteful grown  Sabina Caelia's shape ran down  And she Sabina's eye  Their envy made the shepherd find  Those eyes which love could only blind  So set the lover free  No more he haunts the grove or stream  Or with a truelove knot and name  Engraves a wounded tree  Ah Caelia sly Sabina cry'd  Tho' neither love we're both deny'd  Now to support the sex's pride  Let either fix the dart  Poor girl says Caelia say no more  For shou'd the swain but one adore  That spite which broke his chains before  Wou'd break the other's heart  SONG  MY days have been so wond'rous free  The little birds that fly  With careless ease from tree to tree  Were but as bless'd as I  Ask gliding waters if a tear  Of mine encreas'd their stream  Or ask the flying gales if e'er  I lent one sigh to them  But now my former days retire  And I'm by beauty caught  The tender chains of sweet desire  Are fix'd upon my thought  Ye nightingales ye twisting pines  Ye swains that haunt the grove  Ye gentle echoes breezy winds  Ye close retreats of love  With all of nature all of art  Assist the dear design  O teach a young unpractis'd heart  To make my Nancy mine  The very thought of change I hate  As much as of despair  Nor ever covet to be great  Unless it be for her  'Tis true the passion in my mind  Is mix'd with soft distress  Yet while the fair I love is kind  I cannot wish it less  ANACREONTIC  WHEN Spring came on with fresh delight  To cheer the soul and charm the sight  While easy breezes softer rain  And warmer suns salute the plain  'Twas then in yonder piny grove  That Nature went to meet with Love  Green was her robe and green her wreath  Wheree'er she trod 'twas green beneath  Wheree'er she turn'd the pulses beat  With new recruits of genial heat  And in her train the birds appear  To match for all the coming year  Rais'd on a bank where daizys grew  And vi'lets intermix'd a blue  She finds the boy she went to find  A thousand pleasures wait behind  Aside a thousand arrows ly  But all unfeather'd wait to fly  When they met the Dame and Boy  Dancing Graces idle Joy  Wanton Smiles and airy Play  Conspir'd to make the scene be gay  Love pair'd the birds through all the grove  And Nature bid them sing to Love  Sitting hopping flutt'ring sing  And pay their tribute from the wing  To fledge the shafts that idly ly  And yet unfeather'd wait to fly  'Tis thus when Spring renews the blood  They meet in ev'ry trembling wood  And thrice they make the plumes agree  And ev'ry dart they mount with three  And ev'ry dart can boast a kind  Which suits each proper turn of mind  From the tow'ring Eagle's plume  The gen'rous Hearts accept their doom  Shot by the Peacock's painted eye  The vain and airy lovers dye  For careful dames and frugal men  The shafts are speckled by the Hen  The Pyes and Parrots deck the darts  When Prattling wins the panting hearts  When from the Voice the passions spring  The warbling Finch affords a wing  Together by the Sparrow stung  Down fall the wanton and the young  And fledg'd by Geese the weapons fly  When others love they know not why  All this as late I chanc'd to rove  I learn'd in yonder waving grove  And see says Love who call'd me near  How much I deal with Nature here  How both support a proper part  She gives the feather I the dart  Then cease for souls averse to sigh  If Nature cross ye so do I  My weapon there unfeather'd flies  And shakes and shuffles through the skies  But if the mutual charms I find  By which she links you mind to mind  They wing my shafts I poize the darts  And strike from both through both your hearts  ANACREONTIC  GAY Bacchus liking Estcourt's wine  A noble meal bespoke us  And for the guests that were to dine  Brought Comus Love and Jocus  The God near Cupid drew his chair  Near Comus Jocus plac'd  For Wine makes Love forget its care  And Mirth exalts a feast  The more to please the sprightly God  Each sweet engaging Grace  Put on some cloaths to come abroad  And took a waiter's place  Then Cupid nam'd at every glass  A lady of the sky  While Bacchus swore he'd drink the lass  And had it bumperhigh  Fat Comus tost his brimmers o'er  And always got the most  Jocus took care to fill him more  Whene'er he miss'd the toast  They call'd and drank at every touch  He fill'd and drank again  And if the gods can take too much  'Tis said they did so then  Gay Bacchus little Cupid stung  By reck'ning his deceits  And Cupid mock'd his stamm'ring tongue  With all his stagg'ring gaits  And Jocus droll'd on Comus' ways  And tales without a jest  While Comus call'd his witty plays  But waggeries at best  Such talk soon set 'em all at odds  And had I Homer's pen  I'd sing ye how they drunk like gods  And how they fought like men  To part the fray the Graces fly  Who make 'em soon agree  Nay had the furies selves been nigh  They still were three to three  Bacchus appeas'd rais'd Cupid up  And gave him back his bow  But kept some darts to stir the cup  Where sack and sugar flow  Jocus took Comus' rosy crown  And gayly wore the prize  And thrice in mirth he push'd him down  As thrice he strove to rise  Then Cupid sought the myrtle grove  Where Venus did recline  And Venus close embracing Love  They join'd to rail at wine  And Comus loudly cursing Wit  Roll'd off to some retreat  Where boon companions gravely sit  In fat unweildy state  Bacchus and Jocus still behind  For one fresh glass prepare  They kiss and are exceeding kind  And vow to be sincere  But part in time whoever hear  This our instructive song  For tho' such friendships may be dear  They can't continue long  A FAIRY TALE IN THE ANTIENT ENGLISH STYLE  IN Britain's isle and Arthur's days  When midnight Faeries daunc'd the maze  Liv'd Edwin of the green  Edwin I wis a gentle youth  Endow'd with courage sense and truth  Tho' badly shap'd he been  His mountain back mote well be said  To measure heigth against his head  And lift itself above  Yet spite of all that nature did  To make his uncouth form forbid  This creature dar'd to love  He felt the charms of Edith's eyes  Nor wanted hope to gain the prize  Cou'd ladies look within  But one Sir Topaz dress'd with art  And if a shape cou'd win a heart  He had a shape to win  Edwin if right I read my song  With slighted passion pac'd along  All in the moony light  'Twas near an old enchaunted court  Where sportive Faeries made resort  To revel out the night  His heart was drear his hope was cross'd  'Twas late 'twas farr the path was lost  That reach'd the neighbourtown  With weary steps he quits the shades  Resolv'd the darkling dome he treads  And drops his limbs adown  But scant he lays him on the floor  When hollow winds remove the door  A trembling rocks the ground  And well I ween to count aright  At once an hundred tapers light  On all the walls around  Now sounding tongues assail his ear  Now sounding feet approachen near  And now the sounds encrease  And from the corner where he lay  He sees a train profusely gay  Come pranckling o'er the place  But trust me Gentles never yet  Was dight a masquing half so neat  Or half so rich before  The country lent the sweet perfumes  The sea the pearl the sky the plumes  The town its silken store  Now whilst he gaz'd a Gallant drest  In flaunting robes above the rest  With awfull accent cry'd  What Mortall of a wretched mind  Whose sighs infect the balmy wind  Has here presum'd to hide  At this the Swain whose vent'rous soul  No fears of Magic art controul  Advanc'd in open sight  'Nor have I cause of dreed he said  'Who view by no presumption led  'Your revels of the night  ''Twas grief for scorn of faithful love  'Which made my steps unweeting rove  'Amid the nightly dew'  'Tis well the Gallant cries again  We Faeries never injure men  Who dare to tell us true  Exalt thy lovedejected heart  Be mine the task or ere we part  To make thee grief resign  Now take the pleasure of thy chaunce  Whilst I with Mab my part'ner daunce  Be little Mable thine  He spoke and all a sudden there  Light music floats in wanton air  The Monarch leads the Queen  The rest their Faerie partners found  And Mable trimly tript the ground  With Edwin of the green  The dauncing past the board was laid  And siker such a feast was made  As heart and lip desire  Withouten hands the dishes fly  The glasses with a wish come nigh  And with a wish retire  But now to please the Faerie King  Full ev'ry deal they laugh and sing  And antic feats devise  Some wind and tumble like an ape  And othersome transmute their shape  In Edwin's wond'ring eyes  'Till one at last that Robin hight  Renown'd for pinching maids by night  Has hent him up aloof  And full against the beam he flung  Where by the back the Youth he hung  To spraul unneath the roof  From thence "Reverse my charm he crys  "And let it fairly now suffice  "The gambol has been shown"  But Oberon answers with a smile  Content thee Edwin for a while  The vantage is thine own  Here ended all the phantome play  They smelt the fresh approach of day  And heard a cock to crow  The whirling wind that bore the crowd  Has clap'd the door and whistled loud  To warn them all to go  Then screaming all at once they fly  And all at once the tapers dy  Poor Edwin falls to floor  Forlorn his state and dark the place  Was never wight in sike a case  Through all the land before  But soon as dan Apollo rose  Full jolly creature home he goes  He feels his back the less  His honest tongue and steady mind  Han rid him of the lump behind  Which made him want success  With lusty livelyhed he talks  He seems a dauncing as he walks  His story soon took wind  And beauteous Edith sees the youth  Endow'd with courage sense and truth  Without a bunch behind  The story told Sir Topaz mov'd  The youth of Edith erst approv'd  To see the revel scene  At close of eve he leaves his home  And wends to find the ruin'd dome  All on the gloomy plain  As there he bides it so befell  The wind came rustling down a dell  A shaking seiz'd the wall  Up spring the tapers as before  The Faeries bragly foot the floor  And music fills the hall  But certes sorely sunk with woe  Sir Topaz sees the Elphin show  His spirits in him dy  When Oberon cries 'a Man is near  'A mortall passion cleeped fear  'Hangs flagging in the sky'  With that Sir Topaz hapless youth  In accents fault'ring ay for ruth  Intreats them pity graunt  For als he been a mister wight  Betray'd by wand'ring in the night  To tread the circled haunt  'Ah losell vile at once they roar  'And little skill'd of Faerie lore  'Thy cause to come we know  'Now has thy kestrell courage fell  'And Faeries since a ly you tell  'Are free to work thee woe'  Then Will who bears the wispy fire  To trail the swains among the mire  The caitive upward flung  There like a tortoise in a shop  He dangled from the chambertop  Where whilome Edwin hung  The revel now proceeds apace  Deffly they frisk it o'er the place  They sit they drink and eat  The time with frolic mirth beguile  And poor Sir Topaz hangs the while  'Till all the rout retreat  By this the starrs began to wink  They skriek they fly the tapers sink  And down ydrops the knight  For never spell by Faerie laid  With strong enchantment bound a glade  Beyond the length of night  Chill dark alone adreed he lay  'Till up the welkin rose the day  Then deem'd the dole was o'er  But wot ye well his harder lot  His seely back the Bunch has got  Which Edwin lost afore  This tale a SybilNurse ared  She softly strok'd my youngling head  And when the tale was done  'Thus some are born my son she cries  'With base impediments to rise  'And some are born with none  'But virtue can itself advance  'To what the fav'rite fools of chance  'By fortune seem'd design'd  'Virtue can gain the odds of fate  'And from itself shake off the weight  'Upon th'unworthy Mind  THE VIGIL OF VENUS  WRITTEN IN THE TIME OF JULIUS CAESAR AND BY SOME ASCRIBED TO CATULLUS  "LET those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  The Spring the new the warb'ling Spring appears  The youthful season of reviving years  In Spring the Loves enkindle mutual heats  The feather'd nation chase their tuneful mates  The trees grow fruitful with descending rain  And drest in diff'ring greens adorn the plain  She comes tomorrow Beauty's Empress roves  Thro' walks that winding run within the groves  She twines the shooting myrtle into bow'rs  And ties their meeting tops with wreaths of flow'rs  Then rais'd sublimely on her easy throne  From Nature's pow'rful dictates draws her own  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  'Twas on that day which saw the teeming flood  Swell round impregnate with celestial blood  Wand'ring in circles stood the finny crew  The midst was left a void expanse of blue  There parent Ocean work'd with heaving throes  And dropping wet the fair Dione rose  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  She paints the purple year with vary'd show  Tips the green gem and makes the blossom glow  She makes the turgid buds receive the breeze  Expand to leaves and shade the naked trees  When gath'ring damps the misty nights diffuse  She sprinkles all the morn with balmy dews  Bright trembling pearls depend at every spray  And kept from falling seem to fall away  A glossy freshness hence the Rose receives  And blushes sweet through all her silken leaves  The drops descending through the silent night  While stars serenely roll their golden light  Close 'till the morn her humid veil she holds  Then deckt with virgin pomp the slow'r unfolds  Soon will the morning blush ye maids prepare  In rosy garlands bind your flowing hair  'Tis Venus' plant the blood fair Venus shed  O'er the gay beauty pour'd immortal red  From Love's soft kiss a sweet Ambrosial smell  Was taught for ever on the leaves to dwell  From gemms from flames from orient rays of light  The richest lustre makes her purple bright  And she tomorrow weds the sporting gale  Unties her zone she bursts the verdant veil  Thro' all her sweets the rifling lover flies  And as he breathes her glowing fires arise  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  Now fair Dione to the myrtle grove  Sends the gay Nymphs and sends her tender Love  And shall they venture is it safe to go  While Nymphs have hearts and Cupid wears a bow  Yes safely venture 'tis his mother's will  He walks unarm'd and undesigning ill  His torch extinct his quiver useless hung  His arrows idle and his bow unstrung  And yet ye Nymphs beware his eyes have charms  And Love that's naked still is Love in arms  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  From Venus' bow'r to Delia's lodge repairs  A virgin train compleat with modest airs  'Chaste Delia grant our suit or shun the wood  'Nor stain this sacred lawn with savage blood  'Venus O Delia if she cou'd persuade  'Wou'd ask thy presence might she ask a maid'  Here chearful quires for three auspicious nights  With songs prolong the pleasurable rites  Here crouds in measures lightlydecent rove  Or seek by pairs the covert of the grove  Where meeting greens for arbours arch above  And mingling flowrets strow the scenes of love  Here dancing Ceres shakes her golden sheaves  Here Bacchus revels deckt with viny leaves  Here wit's enchanting God in lawrel crown'd  Wakes all the ravish'd Hours with silver sound  Ye fields ye forests own Dione's reign  And Delia huntress Delia shun the plain  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  Gay with the bloom of all her opening year  The Queen at Hybla bids her throne appear  And there presides and there the fav'rite band  Her smiling Graces share the great command  Now beauteous Hybla dress thy flow'ry beds  With all the pride the lavish season sheds  Now all thy colours all thy fragrance yield  And rival Enna's aromatic field  To fill the presence of the gentle court  From ev'ry quarter rural Nymphs resort  From woods from mountains from their humble vales  From waters curling with the wanton gales  Pleas'd with the joyful train the laughing Queen  In circles seats them round the bank of green  And  lovely girls she whispers guard your hearts  'My boy tho' stript of arms abounds in arts  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  Let tender grass in shaded alleys spread  Let early flow'rs erect their painted head  Tomorrow's glory be tomorrow seen  That day old Ether wedded Earth in green  The Vernal Father bid the Spring appear  In clouds he coupled to produce the year  The sap descending o'er her bosom ran  And all the various sorts of soul began  By wheels unknown to sight by secret veins  Distilling life the fruitful Goddess reigns  Through all the lovely realms of native day  Through all the circled land and circling sea  With fertil seed she fill'd the pervious earth  And ever fix'd the mystic ways of birth  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  'Twas she the Parent to the Latian shore  Through various dangers Troy's remainder bore  She won Lavinia for her warlike son  And winning her the Latian empire won  She gave to Mars the maid whose honour'd womb  Swell'd with the Founder of immortal Rome  Decoy'd by shows the Sabin dames she led  And taught our vig'rous youth the means to wed  Hence sprung the Romans hence the race divine  Thro' which great Caesar draws his Julian line  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  In rural seats the soul of pleasure reigns  The life of Beauty fills the rural scenes  Ev'n Love if Fame the truth of Love declare  Drew first the breathings of a rural air  Some pleasing meadow pregnant Beauty prest  She laid her infant on its flow'ry breast  From Nature's sweets he sipp'd the fragrant dew  He smil'd he kiss'd them and by kissing grew  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  Now Bulls o'er stalks of broom extend their sides  Secure of favours from their lowing brides  Now stately Rams their fleecy consorts lead  Who bleating follow thro' the wand'ring shade  And now the Goddess bids the birds appear  Raise all their music and salute the year  Then deep the Swan begins and deep the song  Runs o'er the water where he sails along  While Philomela tunes a treble strain  And from the poplar charms the list'ning plain  We fancy love exprest at ev'ry note  It melts it warbles in her liquid throat  Of barb'rous Tereus she complains no more  But sings for pleasure as for grief before  And still her graces rise her airs extend  And all is silence 'till the Syren end  How long in coming is my lovely Spring  And when shall I and when the Swallow sing  Sweet Philomela ceaseOr here I sit  And silent lose my rapt'rous hour of wit  'Tis gone the sit retires the flames decay  My tuneful Phoebus flies averse away  His own Amycle thus as stories run  But once was silent and that once undone  "Let those love now who never lov'd before  "Let those who always lov'd now love the more"  PERVIGILIUM VENERIS  "CRAS amet qui numquam amavit quique a∣mavit "cras amet"  Ver novum ver jam canorum

Attend my labours and reward my pray'r  The dreadful toils of raging Mars I write  The springs of contest and the fields of fight  How threat'ning Mice advanc'd with warlike grace  And wag'd dire combats with the croaking race  Not louder tumults shook Olympus' tow'rs  When earthborn giants dar'd immortal pow'rs  Those equal acts in equal glory claim  And thus the Muse records the tale of fame  Once on a time fatigu'd and out of breath  And just escap'd the stretching claws of death  A gentle Mouse whom Cats pursu'd in vain  Fled swiftoffoot across the neighb'ring plain  Hung o'er a brink his eager thirst to cool  And dipt his whiskers in the standing pool  When near a courteous Frog advanc'd his head  And from the waters hoarseresounding said  What art thou stranger what the line you boast  What chance has cast thee panting on our coast  With strictest truth let all thy words agree  Nor let me find a faithless Mouse in thee  If worthy friendship proffer'd friendship take  And ent'ring view the pleasurable lake  Range o'er my palace in my bounty share  And glad return from hospitable fare  This silver realm extends beneath my sway  And me their monarch all its Frogs obey  Great Physignathus I from Peleus' race  Begot in fair Hydromede's embrace  Where by the nuptial bank that paints his side  The swift Eridanus delights to glide  Thee too thy form thy strength and port proclaim  A scepter'd king a son of martial fame  Then trace thy line and aid my guessing eyes  Thus ceas'd the Frog and thus the Mouse replies  Known to the Gods the men the birds that fly  Thro' wild expanses of the midway sky  My name resounds and if unknown to thee  The soul of great Psycarpax lives in me  Of brave Troxartas' line whose sleeky down  In love compress'd Lychomile the brown  My mother she and princess of the plains  Wheree'er her father Pternotroctas reigns  Born where a cabin lifts its airy shed  With figs with nuts with vary'd dainties fed  But since our natures nought in common know  From what foundation can a friendship grow  These curling waters o'er thy palace roll  But man's high food supports my princely soul  In vain the circled loaves attempt to lye  Conceal'd in flaskets from my curious eye  In vain the tripe that boasts the whitest hue  In vain the gilded bacon shuns my view  In vain the cheeses offspring of the paile  Or honey'd cakes which Gods themselves regale  And as in arts I shine in arms I fight  Mix'd with the bravest and unknown to flight  Tho' large to mine the human form appear  Not Man himself can smite my soul with fear  Sly to the bed with silent steps I go  Attempt his finger or attack his toe  And six indented wounds with dext'rous skill  Sleeping he feels and only seems to feel  Yet have we foes which direful dangers cause  Grim owls with talons arm'd and Cats with claws  And that false Trap the den of silent fate  Where Death his ambush plants around the bait  Alldreaded these and dreadful o'er the rest  The potent warriors of the tabby vest  If to the dark we fly the dark they trace  And rend our heroes of the nibbling race  But me nor stalks nor watrish herbs delight  Nor can the crimson radish charm my sight  The lakeresounding Frogs selected fare  Which not a Mouse of any taste can bear  As thus the downy prince his mind exprest  His answer thus the croaking king addrest  Thy words luxuriant on thy dainties rove  And stranger we can boast of bounteous Jove  We sport in water or we dance on land  And born amphibious food from both command  But trust thyself where wonders ask thy view  And safely tempt those seas I'll bear thee thro'  Ascend my shoulders firmly keep thy seat  And reach my marshy court and feast in state  He said and bent his back with nimble bound  Leaps the light Mouse and clasps his arms around  Then wond'ring floats and sees with glad survey  The winding banks resembling ports at sea  But when aloft the curling water rides  And wets with azure wave his downy sides  His thoughts grow conscious of approaching woe  His idle tears with vain repentance flow  His locks he rends his trembling feet he rears  Thick beats his heart with unaccustom'd fears  His sighs and chill'd with danger longs for shore  His tail extended forms a fruitless oar  Halfdrench'd in liquid death his pray'rs he spake  And thus bemoan'd him from the dreadful lake  So pass'd Europa thro' the rapid sea  Trembling and fainting all the vent'rous way  With oary feet the bull triumphant rode  And safe in Crete depos'd his lovely load  Ah safe at last may thus the Frog support  My trembling limbs to reach his ample court  As thus he sorrows death ambiguous grows  Lo from the deep a waterHydra rose  He rolls his sanguin'd eyes his bosom heaves  And darts with active rage along the waves  Confus'd the monarch sees his hissing foe  And dives to shun the sable fates below  Forgetful Frog the friend thy shoulders bore  Unskill'd in swimming floats remote from shore  He grasps with fruitless hands to find relief  Supinely falls and grinds his teeth with grief  Plunging he sinks and struggling mounts again  And sinks and strives but strives with fate in vain  The weighty moisture clogs his hairy vest  And thus the Prince his dying rage exprest  Nor thou that fling'st me flound'ring from thy back  As from hard rocks rebounds the shatt'ring wrack  Nor thou shalt 'scape thy due perfidious king  Pursu'd by vengeance on the swiftest wing  At land thy strength could never equal mine  At sea to conquer and by craft was thine  But heav'n has Gods and Gods have searching eyes  Ye Mice ye Mice my great avengers rise  This said he sighing gasp'd and gasping dy'd  His death the young Lychopinax espy'd  As on the flow'ry brink he pass'd the day  Bask'd in the beams and loiter'd life away  Loud shrieks the Mouse his shrieks the shores repeat  The nibbling nation learn their heroe's fate  Grief dismal grief ensues deep murmurs sound  And shriller fury fills the deafen'd ground  From lodge to lodge the sacred Heralds run  To fix their council with the rising sun  Where great Troxartas crown'd in glory reigns  And winds his length'ning court beneath the plains  Psycarpax' father father now no more  For poor Psycarpax lies remote from shore  Supine he lies the silent waters stand  And no kind billow wafts the dead to land  BOOK II  WHEN rosysinger'd morn had ting'd the clouds  Around their MonarchMouse the nation crouds  Slow rose the sov'reign heav'd his anxious breast  And thus the council fill'd with rage addrest  For lost Psycarpax much my soul endures  'Tis mine the private grief the public yours  Three warlike sons adorn'd my nuptial bed  Three sons alas before their father dead  Our eldest perish'd by the rav'ning Cat  As near my court the Prince unheedful sate  Our next an engine fraught with danger drew  The portal gap'd the bait was hung in view  Dire Arts assist the Trap the Fates decoy  And men unpitying kill'd my gallant Boy  The last his Country's hope his Parent's pride  Plung'd in the lake by Physignathus dy'd  Rouse all the war my friends avenge the deed  And bleed that Monarch and his Nation bleed  His words in ev'ry breast inspir'd alarms  And careful Mars supply'd their host with arms  In verdant hulls despoil'd of all their beans  The buskin'd warriors stalk'd along the plains  Quills aptly bound their bracing corselet made  Fac'd with the plunder of a Cat they flay'd  The lamp's round boss affords their ample shield  Large shells of nuts their cov'ring helmet yield  And o'er the region with reflected rays  Tall groves of needles for their lances blaze  Dreadful in arms the marching Mice appear  The wond'ring Frogs perceive the tumult near  Forsake the waters thick'ning form a ring  And ask and hearken whence the noises spring  When near the croud disclos'd to public view  The valiant chief Embasichytros drew  The sacred herald's scepter grac'd his hand  And thus his words exprest his king's command  Ye Frogs the Mice with vengeance fir'd advance  And deckt in armour shake the shining lance  Their hapless Prince by Physignathus slain  Extends incumbent on the watry plain  Then arm your host the doubtful battle try  Lead forth those Frogs that have the soul to die  The chief retires the crowd the challenge hear  And proudlyswelling yet perplex'd appear  Much they resent yet much their Monarch blame  Who rising spoke to clear his tainted fame  O friends I never forc'd the Mouse to death  Nor saw the gaspings of his latest breath  He vain of youth our art of swimming try'd  And vent'rous in the lake the wanton dy'd  To vengeance now by false appearance led  They point their anger at my guiltless head  But wage the rising war by deep device  And turn its fury on the crafty Mice  Your King directs the way my thoughts elate  With hopes of conquest form designs of fate  Where high the banks their verdant surface heave  And the steep sides confine the sleeping wave  There near the margin clad in armour bright  Sustain the first impetuous shocks of fight  Then where the dancing feather joins the crest  Let each brave Frog his obvious Mouse arrest  Each strongly grasping headlong plunge a foe  'Till countless circles whirl the lake below  Down sink the Mice in yielding waters drown'd  Loud flash the waters and the shores resound  The Frogs triumphant tread the conquer'd plain  And raise their glorious trophies of the slain  He spake no more his prudent scheme imparts  Redoubling ardour to the boldest hearts  Green was the suit his arming heroes chose  Around their legs the greaves of mallows close  Green were the beets about their shoulders laid  And green the colewort which the target made  Form'd of the vary'd shells the waters yield  Their glossy helmets glist'ned o'er the field  And tap'ring seareeds for the polish'd spear  With upright order pierc'd the ambient air  Thus dress'd for war they take th'appointed height  Poize the long arms and urge the promis'd fight  But now where Jove's irradiate spires arise  With stars surrounded in aetherial skies  A solemn council call'd the brazen gates  Unbar the Gods assume their golden seats  The sire superior leans and points to show  What wond'rous combats mortals wage below  How strong how large the num'rous heroes stride  What length of lance they shake with warlike pride  What eager fire their rapid march reveals  So the fierce Centaurs ravag'd o'er the dales  And so confirm'd the daring Titans rose  Heap'd hills on hills and bid the Gods be foes  This seen the pow'r his sacred visage rears  He casts a pitying smile on worldly cares  And asks what heav'nly guardians take the list  Or who the Mice or who the Frogs assist  Then thus to Pallas If my daughter's mind  Have join'd the Mice why stays she still behind  Drawn forth by sav'ry steams they wind their way  And sure attendance round thine altar pay  Where while the victims gratify their taste  They sport to please the Goddess of the feast  Thus spake the Ruler of the spacious skies  But thus resolv'd the blueey'd maid replies  In vain my Father all their dangers plead  To such thy Pallas never grants her aid  My flow'ry wreaths they petulantly spoil  And rob my chrystal lamps of feeding oil  Ills following ills but what afflicts me more  My veil that idle race profanely tore  The web was curious wrought with art divine  Relentless wretches all the work was mine  Along the loom the purple warp I spread  Cast the light shoot and crost the silver thread  In this their teeth a thousand breaches tear  The thousand breaches skilful hands repair  For which vile earthly dunns thy daughter grieve  The Gods that use no coin have none to give  And Learning's Goddess never less can owe  Neglected learning gains no wealth below  Nor let the Frogs to win my succour sue  Those clam'rous fools have lost my favour too  For late when all the conflict ceast at night  When my stretch'd sinews work'd with eager fight  When spent with glorious toil I left the field  And sunk for slumber on my swelling shield  Lo from the deep repelling sweet repose  With noisy croakings half the nation rose  Devoid of rest with aking brows I lay  'Till cocks proclaim'd the crimson dawn of day  Let all like me from either host forbear  Nor tempt the flying furies of the spear  Lest heav'nly blood or what for blood may flow  Adorn the conquest of a meaner foe  Some daring Mouse may meet the wond'rous odds  Tho' Gods oppose and brave the wounded Gods  O'er gilded clouds reclin'd the danger view  And be the wars of mortals scenes for you  So mov'd the blueey'd Queen her words persuade  Great Jove assented and the rest obey'd  BOOK III  NOW front to front the marching armies shine  Haltere they meet and form the length'ning line  The chiefs conspicuous seen and heard afar  Give the loud signal to the rushing war  Their dreadful trumpets deepmouth'd hornets sound  The sounded charge remurmurs o'er the ground  Ev'n Jove proclaims a field of horror nigh  And rolls low thunder thro' the troubled sky  First to the fight the large Hypsiboas flew  And brave Lychenor with a javelin slew  The luckless warrior fill'd with gen'rous flame  Stood foremost glitt'ring in the post of fame  When in his liver struck the jav'lin hung  The Mouse fell thund'ring and the target rung  Prone to the ground he sinks his closing eye  And soil'd in dust his lovely tresses lie  A spear at Pelion Troglodytes cast  The missive spear within the bosom past  Death's sable shades the fainting Frog surround  And life's red tide runs ebbing from the wound  Embasichytros felt Seutlaeus' dart  Transfix and quiver in his panting heart  But great Artophagus aveng'd the slain  And big Seutlaeus tumbling loads the plain  And Polyphonus dies a Frog renown'd  For boastful speech and turbulence of sound  Deep thro' the belly pierc'd supine he lay  And breath'd his soul against the face of day  The strong Lymnocharis who view'd with ire  A victor triumph and a friend expire  And fiercely flung where Troglodytes fought  With heaving arms a rocky fragment caught  A warrior vers'd in arts of sure retreat  But arts in vain elude impending fate  Full on his sinewy neck the fragment fell  And o'er his eyelids clouds eternal dwell  Lychenor second of the glorious name  Striding advanc'd and took no wand'ring aim  Thro' all the Frog the shining jav'lin flies  And near the vanquish'd Mouse the victor dies  The dreadful stroke Crambophagus affrights  Long bred to banquets less inur'd to fights  Heedless he runs and stumbles o'er the steep  And wildly flound'ring flashes up the deep  Lycheror following with a downward blow  Reach'd in the lake his unrecover'd foe  Gasping he rolls a purple stream of blood  Distains the surface of the silver flood  Thro' the wide wound the rushing entrails throng  And slow the breathless carcass floats along  Lymnisius good Tyroglyphus assails  Prince of the Mice that haunt the flow'ry vales  Lost to the milky fares and rural seat  He came to perish on the bank of fate  The dread Pternoglyphus demands the fight  Which tender Calaminthius shuns by slight  Drops the green target springing quits the foe  Glides thro' the lake and safely dives below  But dire Pternophagus divides his way  Thro' breaking ranks and leads the dreadful day  No nibbling prince excell'd in fierceness more  His parents fed him on the savage boar  But where his lance the field with blood imbru'd  Swift as he mov'd Hydrocharis putsu'd  'Till fall'n in death he lies a shatt'ring stone  Sounds on the neck and crushes all the bone  His blood pollutes the verdure of the plain  And from his nostrils bursts the gushing brain  Lycopinax with Borbocaetes fights  A blameless Frog whom humbler life delights  The fatal jav'lin unrelenting flies  And darkness seals the gentle croaker's eyes  Incens'd Prassophagus with spritely bound  Bears Cnissodioctes off the rising ground  Then drags him o'er the lake depriv'd of breath  And downward plunging sinks his soul to death  But now the great Psycarpax shines afar  Scarce he so great whose loss provok'd the war  Swift to revenge his fatal jav'lin fled  And thro'the liver struck Pelusius dead  His freckled corps before the victor fell  His soul indignant sought the shades of hell  This saw Pelobates and from the flood  Heav'd with both hands a monstrous mass of mud  The cloud obscene o'er all the hero flies  Dishonours his brown face and blots his eyes  Enrag'd and wildly sputt'ring from the shore  A stone immense of size the warrior bore  A load for lab'ring earth whose bulk to raise  Asks ten degen'rate Mice of modern days  Full on the leg arrives the crushing wound  The Frog supportless writhes upon the ground  Thus flush'd the victor wars with matchless force  'Till loud Craugasides arrests his course  Hoarsecroaking threats precede with fatal speed  Deep thro' the belly run the pointed reed  Then strongly tugg'd return'd imbru'd with gore  And on the pile his reeking entrails bore  The lame Sitophagus oppress'd with pain  Creeps from the desp'rate dangers of the plain  And where the ditches rising weeds supply  To spread their lowly shades beneath the sky  There lurks the silent Mouse reliev'd from heat  And safe embour'd avoids the chance of fate  But here Troxartes Physignathus there  Whirl the dire furies of the pointed spear  But where the foot around its ankle plies  Troxartes wounds and Physignathus flies  Halts to the pool a safe retreat to find  And trails a dangling length of leg behind  The Mouse still urges still the Frog retires  And half in anguish of the flight expires  Then pious ardor young Pressaeus brings  Betwixt the fortunes of contending kings  Lank harmless Frog with forces hardly grown  He darts the reed in combats not his own  Which faintly tinkling on Troxartes' shield  Hangs at the point and drops upon the field  Now nobly tow'ring o'er the rest appears  A gallant prince that far transcends his years  Pride of his sire and glory of his house  And more a Mars in combat than a Mouse  His action bold robust his ample frame  And Meridarpax his resounding name  The warrior singled from the fighting crowd  Boasts the dire honours of his arms aloud  Then strutting near the lake with looks elate  To all its nations threats approaching fate  And such his strength the silver lakes around  Might roll their waters o'er unpeopled ground  But pow'rful Jove who shews no less his grace  To Frogs that perish than to human race  Felt soft compassion rising in his soul  And shook his sacred head that shook the pole  Then thus to all the gazing pow'rs began  The sire of Gods and Frogs and Mice and Man  What seas of blood I view what worlds of slain  An Iliad rising from a day's campaign  How fierce his jav'lin o'er the trembling lakes  The blackfurr'd hero Meridarpax shakes  Unless some fav'ring deity descend  Soon will the Frogs loquacious empire end  Let dreadful Pallas wing'd with pity fly  And make her Aegis blaze before his eye  While Mars refulgent on his rattling car  Arrests his raging rival of the war  He ceas'd reclining with attentive head  When thus the glorious God of combats said  Nor Pallas Jove tho' Pallas take the field  With all the terrors of her hissing shield  Nor Mars himself tho' Mars in armour bright  Ascend his car and wheel amidst the fight  Not these can drive the desp'rate Mouse afar  Or change the fortunes of the bleeding war  Let all go forth all heav'n in arms arise  Or launch thy own red thunder from the skies  Such ardent bolts as flew that wond'rous day  When heaps of Titans mix'd with mountains lay  When all the giantrace enormous fell  And huge Enceladus was hurl'd to hell  'Twas thus th' Armipotent advis'd the Gods  When from his throne the cloudcompeller nods  Deep lengthning thunders run from pole to pole  Olympus trembles as the thunders roll  Then swift he whirls the brandish'd bolt around  And headlong darts it at the distant ground  The bolt discharg'd inwrap'd with light'ning flies  And rends its flaming passage thro' the skies  Then Earth's inhabitants the nibblers shake  And Frogs the dwellers in the waters quake  Yet still the Mice advance their dread design  And the last danger threats the croaking line  'Till Jove that inly mourn'd the loss they bore  With strange assistants fill'd the frighted shore  Pour'd from the neighb'ring strand deform'd to view  They march a sudden unexpected crew  Strong sutes of armour round their bodies close  Which like thick anvils blunt the force of blows  In wheeling marches turn'd oblique they go  With harpy claws their limbs divide below  Fell sheers the passage to their mouth command  From out the flesh their bones by nature stand  Broad spread their backs their shining shoulders rise  Unnumber'd joints distort their lengthen'd thighs  With nervous cords their hands are firmly brac'd  Their round black eyeballs in their bosom plac'd  On eight long feet the wond'rous warriors tread  And either end alike supplies a head  These mortal wits to call the Crabs agree  The Gods have other names for things than we  Now where the jointures from their loins depend  The heroes tails with sev'ring grasps they rend  Here short of feet depriv'd the pow'r to fly  There without hands upon the field they lie  Wrench'd from their holds and scatter'd all around  The bended lances heap the cumber'd ground  Helpless amazement fear pursuing fear  And mad confusion thro' their host appear  O'er the wild waste with headlong flight they go  Or creep conceal'd in vaulted holes below  But down Olympus to the western seas  Farshooting Phoebus drove with fainter rays  And a whole war so Jove ordain'd begun  Was fought and ceas'd in one revolving sun  TO MR POPE  TO praise yet still with due respect to praise  A Bard triumphant in immortal bays  The learn'd to show the sensible commend  Yet still preserve the province of the friend  What life what vigour must the lines require  What music tune them what affection fire  O might thy genius in my bosom shine  Thou shouldst not fail of numbers worthy thine  The brightest ancients might at once agree  To sing within my lays and sing of thee  Horace himself wou'd own thou dost excell  In candid arts to play the critic well  Ovid himself might wish to sing the dame  Whom Windsor Forest sees a gliding stream  On silver feet with annual osier crown'd  She runs for ever thro' poetic ground  How flame the glories of Belinda's hair  Made by thy Muse the envy of the fair  Less shone the tresses Egypt's princess wore  Which sweet Callimachus so sung before  Here courtly trifles set the world at odds  Belles war with Beaux and Whims descend for Gods  The new Machines in names of ridicule  Mock the grave phrenzy of the Chymic fool  But know ye fair a point conceal'd with art  The Sylphs and Gnomes are but a woman's heart  The Graces stand in sight a Satyr train  Peep o'er their heads and laugh behind the scene  In Fame's fair Temple o'er the boldest wits  Inshrin'd on high the sacred Virgil sits  And sits in measures such as Virgil's muse  To place thee near him might be fond to chuse  How might he tune th' alternate reed with thee  Perhaps a Strephon thou a Daphnis he  While some old Damon o'er the vulgar wise  Thinks he deserves and thou deserv'st the prize  Rapt with the thought my Fancy seeks the plains  And turns me shepherd while I hear the strains  Indulgent nurse of ev'ry tender gale  Parent of slowrets old Arcadia hail  Here in the cool my limbs at ease I spread  Here let thy poplars whisper o'er my head  Still slide thy waters soft among the trees  Thy aspins quiver in a breathing breeze  Smile all thy vallies in eternal Spring  Be hush'd ye winds while Pope and Virgil sing  In English lays and all sublimely great  Thy Homer warms with all his antient heat  He shines in council thunders in the fight  And flames with ev'ry sense of great delight  Long has that Poet reign'd and long unknown  Like monarchs sparkling on a distant throne  In all the majesty of Greek retir'd  Himself unknown his mighty name admir'd  His language failing wrap'd him round with night  Thine rais'd by thee recals the work to light  So wealthy mines that ages long before  Fed the large realms around with golden oar  When choak'd by sinking banks no more appear  And shepherds only say The mines were here  Shou'd some rich youth if Nature warm his heart  And all his projects stand inform'd with art  Here clear the caves there ope the leading vein  The mines detected flame with gold again  How vast how copious are thy new designs  How ev'ry music varies in thy lines  Still as I read I feel my bosom beat  And rise in raptures by another's heat  Thus in the wood when Summer dress'd the days  When Windsor lent us tuneful hours of ease  Our ears the Lark the Thrush the Turtle blest  And Philomela sweetest o'er the rest  The shades resound with songO softly tread  While a whole season warbles round my head  This to my friendand when a friend inspires  My silent harp its master's hand requires  Shakes off the dust and makes these rocks resound  For fortune plac'd me in unfertile ground  Far from the joys that with my soul agree  From wit from learningfar oh far from thee  Here mossgrown trees expand the smallest leaf  Here half an acre's corn is half a sheaf  Here hills with naked heads the tempest meet  Rocks at their side and torrents at their feet  Or lazy lakes unconscious of a flood  Whose dull brown Naiads ever sleep in mud  Yet here content can dwell and learned ease  A friend delight me and an author please  Ev'n here I sing while Pope supplies the theme  Show my own love tho' not increase his

cows neglectful of their pasture stand  By turns obsequious to the milker's hand  When Damon softly trod the shaven lawn  Damon a youth from city cares withdrawn  Long was the pleasing walk he wander'd thro'  A cover'd arbour clos'd the distant view  There rests the Youth and while the feather'd throng  Raise their wild music thus contrives a song  Here wasted o'er by mild Etesian air  Thou country Goddess beauteous Health repair  Here let my breast thro' quiv'ring trees inhale  Thy rosy blessings with the morning gale  What are the fields or flow'rs or all I see  Ah tasteless all if not enjoy'd with thee  Joy to my soul I feel the Goddess nigh  The face of Nature cheers as well as I  O'er the flat green refreshing breezes run  The smiling dazies blow beneath the sun  The brooks run purling down with silver waves  The planted lanes rejoice with dancing leaves  The chirping birds from all the compass rove  To tempt the tuneful echoes of the grove  High funny summits deeply shaded dales  Thick mossy banks and flow'ry winding vales  With various prospect gratify the sight  And scatter fix'd attention in delight  Come country Goddess come nor thou suffice  But bring thy mountainsister Exercise  Call'd by thy lively voice she turns her pace  Her winding horn proclaims the finish'd chace  She mounts the rocks she skims the level plain  Dogs hawks and horses crowd her early train  Her hardy face repels the tanning wind  And lines and meshes loosely float behind  All these as means of toil the feeble see  But these are helps to pleasure join'd with thee  Let Sloth lye softning 'till high noon in down  Or lolling fan her in the sult'ry town  Unnerv'd with rest and turn her own disease  Or foster others in luxurious ease  I mount the courser call the deepmouth'd hounds  The fox unkennell'd flies to covert grounds  I lead where stags thro' tangled thickets tread  And shake the saplings with their branching head  I make the faulecons wing their airy way  And soar to seize or stooping strike their prey  To suare the fish I fix the luring bait  To wound the fowl I load the gun with fate  'Tis thus thro' change of exercise I range  And strength and pleasure rise from ev'ry change  Here beauteous Health for all the year remain  When the next comes I'll charm thee thusagain  Oh come thou Goddess of my rural song  And bring thy daughter calm Content along  Dame of the ruddy cheek and laughing eye  From whose bright presence clouds of sorrow fly  For her I mow my walks I plait my bow'rs  Clip my low hedges and support my flow'rs  To welcome her this Summer seat I drest  And here I court her when she comes to rest  When she from exercise to learned ease  Shall change again and teach the change to please  Now friends conversing my sost hours refine  And Tully's Tusculum revives in mine  Now to grave books I bid the mind retreat  And such as make me rather good than great  Or o'er the works of easy fancy rove  Where flutes and innocence amuse the grove  The native bard that on Sicilian plains  First sung the lowly manners of the swains  Or Maro's muse that in the fairest light  Paints rural prospects and the charms of sight  These soft amusements bring content along  And fancy void of sorrow turns to song  Here beauteous Health for all the year remain  When the next comes I'll charm thee thus again  THE FLIES AN ECLOGUE  WHEN in the river cows for coolness stand  And sheep for breezes seek the lofty land  A youth whom Aesop taught that ev'ry tree  Each bird and insect spoke as well as he  Walk'd calmly musing in a shaded way  Where flow'ring hawthorn broke the sunny ray  And thus instructs his moral pen to draw  A scene that obvious in the field he saw  Near a low ditch where shallow waters meet  Which never learnt to glide with liquid feet  Whose Naiads never prattle as they play  But screen'd with hedges slumber out the day  There stands a slender fern's aspiring shade  Whose answ'ring branches regularly lay'd  Put forth their answ'ring boughs and proudly rise  Three stories upward in the nether skies  For shelter here to shun the noonday heat  An airy nation of the Flies retreat  Some in soft air their silken pinions ply  And some from bough to bough delighted sly  Some rise and circling light to perch again  A pleasing murmur hums along the plain  So when a stage invites to pageant shows  If great and small are like appear the Beaux  In boxes some with spruce pretension sit  Some change from seat to seat within the pit  Some roam the scenes or turning cease to roam  Preluding music fills the lofty dome  When thus a fly if what a fly can say  Deserves attention rais'd the rural lay  Where late Amintor made a nymph a bride  Joyful I flew by young Favonia's side  Who mindless of the feasting went to sip  The balmy pleasure of the shepherd's lip  I saw the wanton where I stoop'd to sup  And half resolv'd to drown me in the cup  'Till brush'd by careless hands she soar'd above  Cease beauty cease to vex a tender love  Thus ends the youth the buzzing meadow rung  And thus the rival of his music sung  When suns by thousands shone in orbs of dew  I wafted soft with Zephyretta flew  Saw the clean pail and sought the milky chear  While little Daphne seiz'd my roving dear  Wretch that I was I might have warn'd the dame  Yet sat indulging as the danger came  But the kind huntress left her free to soar  Ah guard ye Lovers guard a mistress more  Thus from the fern whose highprojecting arms  The sleeting nation bent with dusky swarms  The Swains their love in easy music breathe  When tongues and tumult stun the field beneath  Black Ants in teams come darkning all the road  Some call to march and some to lift the load  They strain they labour with incessant pains  Press'd by the cumbrous weight of single grains  The Flies struck silent gaze with wonder down  The busy Burghers reach their earthy town  Where lay the burthens of a wint'ry store  And thence unwearied part in search of more  Yet one grave Sage a moment's space attends  And the small city's loftiest point ascends  Wipes the salt dew that trickles down his face  And thus harangues them with the gravest grace  Ye foolish Nurslings of the Summer air  These gentle tunes and whining songs forbear  Your trees and whisp'ring breeze your Grove and Love  Your Cupid's quiver and his mother's dove  Let bards to business bend their vig'rous wing  And sing but seldom if they love to sing  Else when the flourets of the season fail  And thus your fenny shade forsakes the vale  Tho' one would save ye not one grain of wheat  Shou'd pay such songsters idling at my gate  He ceas'd the Flies incorrigibly vain  Heard the May'r's Speech and fell to sing again  AN ELEGY TO AN OLD BEAUTY  IN vain poor nymph to please our youthful fight  You sleep in cream and frontlets all the night  Your face with patches soil with paint repair  Dress with gay gowns and shade with foreign hair  If truth in spight of manners must be told  Why really Fiftyfive is something old  Once you were young or one whose life's so long  She might have born my mother tells me wrong  And once since Envy's dead before you dye  The women own you play'd a sparkling eye  Taught the light foot a modish little trip  And pouted with the prettiest purple lip  To some new charmer are the roses fled  Which blew to damask all thy cheek with red  Youth calls the Graces there to fix their reign  And Airs by thousands fill their easy train  So parting Summer bids her flow'ry prime  Attend the sun to dress some foreign clime  While with'ring seasons in succession here  Strip the gay gardens and deform the year  But thou since Nature bids the world resign  'Tis now thy daughter's daughter's time to shine  With more address or such as pleases more  She runs her female exercises o'er  Unfurls or closes raps or turns the fan  And smiles or blushes at the creature Man  With quicker life as gilded coaches pass  In sideling courtesy the drops the glass  With better strength on visitdays she bears  To mount her fifty flights of ample stairs  Her mien her shape her temper eyes and tongue  Are sure to conquerfor the rogue is young  And all that's madly wild or oddly gay  We call it only pretty Fanny's way  Let time that makes you homely make you sage  The sphere of wisdom is the sphere of age  'Tis true when beauty dawns with early fire  And hears the flatt'ring tongues of soft desire  If not from virtue from its gravest ways  The soul with pleasing avocation strays  But beauty gone 'tis easier to be wise  As harpers better by the loss of eyes  Henceforth retire reduce your roving airs  Haunt less the plays and more the public pray'rs  Reject the Mechlin head and gold brocade  Go pray in sober Norwich crape array'd  Thy pendent diamonds let thy Fanny take  Their trembling lustre shows how much you shake  Or bid her wear thy necklace row'd with pearl  You'll find your Fanny an obedient girl  So for the rest with less incumbrance hung  You walk thro life unmingled with the young  And view the shade and Substance as you pass  With joint endeavour trifling at the glass  Or Folly drest and rambling all her days  To meet her counterpart and grow by praise  Yet still sedate yourself and gravely plain  You neither fret nor envy at the vain  'Twas thus if man with woman we compare  The wise Athenian crost a glittering fair  Unmov'd by tongues and sights he walk'd the place  Thro' tape toys tinsel gimp perfume and lace  Then bends from Mars's hill his awful eyes  And What a world I never want he cries  But cries unheard for Folly will be free  So parts the buzzing gaudy crowd and he  As careless he for them as they for him  He wrapt in Wisdom and they whirl'd by Whim  THE BOOKWORM  COME hither boy we'll hunt today  The BookWorm ravening beast of prey  Produc'd by parent Earth at odds  As fame reports it with the Gods  Him frantic hunger wildly drives  Against a thousand authors lives  Thro' all the fields of wit he flies  Dreadful his head with clust'ring eyes  With horns without and tusks within  And scales to serve him for a skin  Observe him nearly lest he climb  To wound the bards of antient time  Or down the vale of fancy go  To tear some modern wretch below  On ev'ry corner fix thine eye  Or ten to one he slips thee by  See where his teeth a passage eat  We'll rouse him from the deep retreat  But who the shelter's forc'd to give  'Tis sacred Virgil as I live  From leaf to leaf from song to song  He draws the tadpole form along  He mounts the gilded edge before  He's up he scuds the cover o'er  He turns he doubles there he past  And here we have him caught at last  Insatiate Brute whose teeth abuse  The sweetest servants of the Muse  Nay never offer to deny  I took thee in the fact to fly  His Roses nipt in ev'ry page  My poor Anacreon mourns thy rage  By thee my Ovid wounded lies  By thee my Lesbia's Sparrow dies  Thy rabid teeth have half destroy'd  The work of love in Biddy Floyd  They rent Belinda's locks away  And spoil'd the Blouzelind of Gay  For all for ev'ry single deed  Relentless Justice bids thee bleed  Then fall a Victim to the Nine  Myself the Priest my desk the Shrine  Bring Homer Virgil Tasso near  To pile a sacred altar here  Hold boy thy band outrun thy wit  You reach'd the plays that Ds writ  You reach'd me Phs rustic strain  Pray take your mortal bards again  Come bind the victimthere he lies  And here between his num'rous eyes  This venerable dust I lay  From Manuscripts just swept away  The goblet in my hand I take  For the libation's yet to make  A health to poets all their days  May they have bread as well as praise  Sense may they seek and less engage  In papers fill'd with partyrage  But if their riches spoil their vein  Ye Muses make them poor again  Now bring the weapon yonder blade  With which my tuneful pens are made  I strike the scales that arm thee round  And twice and thrice I print the wound  The sacred altar floats with red  And now he dies and now he's dead  How like the son of Jove I stand  This Hydra stretch'd beneath my hand  Lay bare the monster's entrails here  To see what dangers threat the year  Ye Gods what sonnets on a wench  What lean translations out of French  'Tis plain this lobe is so unfound  Sprints before the months go round  But hold before I close the scene  The sacred altar shou'd be clean  Oh had I Shll's second bays  Or T thy pert and humble lays  Ye pair forgive me when I vow  I never miss'd your works 'till now  I'd tear the leaves to wipe the shrine  That only way you please the Nine  But since I chance to want these two  I'll make the songs of Dy do  Rent from the corps on yonder pin  I hang the scales that brac'd it in  I hang my studious morning gown  And write my own Inscription down  'This Trophy from the Python won  'This Robe in which the deed was done  'These Parnell glorying in the feat  'Hung on these shelves the Muses seat  'Here Ignorance and Hunger found  'Large realms of wit to ravage round  'Here Ignorance and Hunger fell  'Two foes in one I sent to hell  'Ye Poets who my labours see  'Come share the triumph all with me  'Ye Critics born to vex the Muse  'Go mourn the grand Ally you lose'  AN ALLEGORY ON MAN  A Thoughtful being long and spare  Our race of mortals call him Care  Were Homer living well he knew  What name the Gods have call'd him too  With fine mechanic genius wrought  And lov'd to work tho' no one bought  This being by a model bred  In Jove's eternal sable head  Contriv'd a shape impower'd to breathe  And be the Worldling here beneath  The Man rose staring like a stake  Wond'ring to see himself awake  Then look'd so wise before he knew  The bus'ness he was made to do  That pleas'd to see with what a grace  He gravely shew'd his forward face  Jove talk'd of breeding him on high  An Undersomething of the sky  But ere he gave the mighty Nod  Which ever binds a Poet's God  For which his curls ambrosial shake  And mother Earth's oblig'd to quake  He saw old mother Earth arise  She stood confess'd before his eyes  But not with what we read she wore  A castle for a crown before  Nor with long streets and longer roads  Dangling behind her like commodes  As yet with wreaths alone she drest  And trail'd a landskippainted vest  Then thrice she rais'd as Ovid said  And thrice she bow'd her weighty head  Her honours made great Jove she cry'd  This Thing was fashion'd from my side  His hands his heart his head are mine  Then what hast thou to call him thine  Nay rather ask the monarch said  What boots his hand his heart his head  Were what I gave remov'd away  Thy part's an idle shape of clay  Halves more than halves cry'd honest Care  Your pleas wou'd make your titles fair  You claim the body you the foul  But I who join'd them claim the whole  Thus with the Gods debate began  On such a trivial cause as Man  And can celestial tempers rage  Quoth Virgil in a later age  As thus they wrangled Time came by  There's none that paint him such as I  For what the fabling Ancients sung  Makes Saturn old when Time was young  As yet his Winters had not shed  Their silver honours on his head  He just had got his pinions free  From his old sire Eternity  A Serpent girdled round he wore  The tail within the mouth before  By which our Almanacks are clear  That learned Egypt meant the year  A staff he carry'd where on high  A glass was fix'd to measure by  As amber boxes made a show  For heads of canes an age ago  His vest for day and night was py'd  A bending sickle arm'd his side  And Spring's new months his train adorn  The other seasons were unborn  Known by the Gods as near he draws  They make him Umpire of the cause  O'er a low trunk his arm he laid  Where since his Hours a Dial made  Then leaning heard the nice debate  And thus pronounc'd the words of Fate  Since Body from the parent Earth  And Soul from Jove receiv'd a birth  Return they where they first began  But since their Union makes the Man  'Till Jove and Earth shall part these two  To Care who join'd them Man is due  He said and sprung with swift career  To trace a circle for the year  Where ever since the Seasons wheel  And tread on one another's heel  'Tis well said Jove and for consent  Thund'ring he shook the firmament  Our umpire Time shall have his way  With Care I let the creature stay  Let Bus'ness vex him Av'rice blind  Let Doubt and Knowledge rack his mind  Let Error act Opinion speak  And Want afflict and Sickness break  And Anger burn Dejection chill  And Joy distract and Sorrow kill  'Till arm'd by Care and taught to mow  Time draws the long destructive blow  And wasted Man whose quick decay  Comes hurrying on before his day  Shall only find by this decree  The Soul flies sooner back to me  AN IMITATION OF SOME FRENCH VERSES  RELENTLESS Time destroying power  Whom stone and brass obey  Who giv'st to ev'ry flying hour  To work some new decay  Unheard unheeded and unseen  Thy secret saps prevail  And ruin Man a nice machine  By Nature form'd to fail  My change arrives the change I meet  Before I thought it nigh  My Spring my years of pleasure fleet  And all their beauties dye  In Age I search and only find  A poor unfruitful gain  Grave Wisdom stalking slow behind  Oppress'd with loads of pain  My ignorance cou'd once beguile  And fancy'd joys inspire  My errors cherish'd Hope to smile  On newlyborn Desire  But now experience shews the bliss  For which I fondly fought  Not worth the long impatient wish  And ardour of the thought  My youth met Fortune fair array'd  In all her pomp she shone  And might perhaps have well essay'd  To make her gifts my own  But when I saw the blessings show'r  On some unworthy mind  I left the chace and own'd the Pow'r  Was justly painted blind  I pass'd the glories which adorn  The splendid courts of kings  And while the persons mov'd my scorn  I rose to scorn the things  My manhood felt a vig'rous fire  By love encreas'd the more  But years with coming years conspire  To break the chains I wore  In weakness safe the Sex I see  With idle lustre shine  For what are all their joys to me  Which cannot now be mine  But holdI feel my Gout decrease  My troubles laid to rest  And truths which wou'd disturb my peace  Are painful truths at best  Vainly the time I have to roll  In sad reflection flies  Ye fondling passions of my soul  Ye sweet deceits arise  I wisely change the scene within  To things that us'd to please  In Pain Philosophy is Spleen  In Health 'tis only Ease  A NIGHTPIECE ON DEATH  BY the blue taper's trembling light  No more I waste the wakeful night  Intent with endless view to pore  The schoolmen and the sages o'er  Their books from Wisdom widely stray  Or point at best the longest way  I'll seek a readier path and go  Where Wisdom's surely taught below  How deep yon azure dyes the sky  Where orbs of gold unnumber'd lye  While thro' their ranks in silver pride  The nether crescent seems to glide  The slumb'ring breeze forgets to breathe  The lake is smooth and clear beneath  Where once again the spangled show  Descends to meet our eyes below  The grounds which on the right aspire  In dimness from the view retire  The left presents a place of graves  Whose wall the silent water laves  That steeple guides thy doubtful sight  Among the livid gleams of night  There pass with melancholy state  By all the solemn heaps of fate  And think as softlysad you tread  Above the venerable dead  "Time was like thee they life possest  "And time shall be that thou shalt rest  Those graves with bending osier bound  That nameless heave the crumbled ground  Quick to the glancing thought disclose  Where Toil and Poverty repose  The flat smooth stones that bear a name  The chissel's slender help to fame  Which ere our sett of friends decay  Their frequent steps may wear away  A Middle Race of Mortals own  Men half ambitious all unknown  The marble tombs that rise on high  Whose dead in vaulted arches lye  Whose pillars swell with sculptur'd stones  Arms angels epitaphs and bones  These all the poor remains of state  Adorn the Rich or praise the Great  Who while on earth in fame they live  Are senseless of the fame they give  Ha while I gaze pale Cynthia fades  The bursting earth unveils the shades  All slow and wan and wrap'd with shrouds  They rise in visionary crouds  And all with sober accent cry  "Think Mortal what it is to die"  Now from yon black and fun'ral yew  That bathes the charnelhouse with dew  Methinks I hear a Voice begin  Ye Ravens cease your croaking din  Ye tolling clocks no time resound  O'er the long lake and midnight ground  It sends a peal of hollow groans  Thus speaking from among the bones  When men my scythe and darts supply  How great a King of Fears am I  They view me like the last of things  They make and then they dread my stings  Fools if you less provok'd your fears  No more my spectreform appears  Death's but a path that must be trod  If Man wou'd ever pass to God  A port of calms a state of ease  From the rough rage of swelling seas  Why then thy flowing sable stoles  Deep pendent cypress mourning poles  Loose scarfs to fall athwart thy weeds  Long palls drawn herses cover'd steeds  And plumes of black that as they tread  Nod o'er the 'scutcheons of the dead  Nor can the parted body know  Nor wants the soul these forms of woe  As men who long in prison dwell  With lamps that glimmer round the cell  Whene'er their suffering years are run  Spring forth to greet the glitt'ring sun  Such joy tho' far transcending sense  Have pious souls at parting hence  On earth and in the body plac'd  A few and evil years they waste  But when their chains are cast aside  See the glad scene unfolding wide  Clap the glad wing and tow'r away  And mingle with the blaze of day  A HYMN TO CONTENTMENT  LOVELY lasting peace of mind  Sweet delight of humankind  Heav'nly born and bred on high  To crown the fav'rites of the sky  With more of happiness below  Than victors in a triumph know  Whither O whither art thou fled  To lay thy meek contented head  What happy region dost thou please  To make the seat of calms and ease  Ambition searches all its sphere  Of pomp and state to meet thee there  Encreasing Avarice would find  Thy presence in its gold enshrin'd  The bold advent'rer ploughs his way  Thro' rocks amidst the foaming sea  To gain thy love and then perceives  Thou wert not in the rocks and waves  The silent heart which grief assails  Treads soft and lonesome o'er the vales  Sees daisies open rivers run  And seeks as I have vainly done  Amusing thought but learns to know  That solitude's the nurse of woe  No real happiness is found  In trailing purple o'er the ground  Or in a soul exalted high  To range the circuit of the sky  Converse with stars above and know  All nature in its forms below  The rest it seeks in seeking dies  And doubts at last for knowledge rise  Lovely lasting peace appear  This world itself if thou art here  Is once again with Eden bless'd  And man contains it in his breast  'Twas thus as under shade I stood  I sung my wishes to the wood  And lost in thought no more perceiv'd  The branches whisper as they wav'd  It seem'd as all the quiet place  Confess'd the presence of the grace  When thus she spokego rule thy will  Bid thy wild passions all be still  Know Godand bring thy heart to know  The joys which from religion flow  Then ev'ry grace shall prove its guest  And I'll be there to crown the rest  Oh by yonder mossy seat  In my hours of sweet retreat  Might I thus my soul employ  With sense of gratitude and joy  Rais'd as ancient prophets were  In heav'nly vision praise and pray'r  Pleasing all men hurting none  Pleas'd and bless'd with God alone  Then while the gardens take my sight  With all the colours of delight  While silver waters glide along  To please my ear and court my song  I'll lift my voice and tune my string  And Thee great source of Nature sing  The fun that walks his airy way  To light the world and give the day  The moon that shines with borrow'd light  The stars that gild the gloomy night  The seas that roll unnumber'd waves  The wood that spreads its shady leaves  The field whose ears conceal the grain  The yellow treasure of the plain  All of these and all I see  Shou'd be sung and sung by me  They speak their Maker as they can  But want and ask the tongue of man  Go search among your idle dreams  Your busy or your vain extreams  And find a life of equal bliss  Or own the next begun in this  THE HERMIT  FAR in a wild unknown to public view  From youth to age a rev'rend Hermit grew  The moss his bed the cave his humble cell  His food the fruits his drink the chrystal well  Remote from man with God he pass'd the days  Pray'r all his bus'ness all his pleasure praise  A life so sacred such serene repose  Seem'd heav'n itself 'till one suggestion rose  That Vice shou'd triumph Virtue Vice obey  This sprung some doubt of Providence's sway  His hopes no more a certain prospect boast  And all the tenour of his soul is lost  So when a smooth expanse receives imprest  Calm Nature's image on its wat'ry breast  Down bend the banks the trees depending grow  And skies beneath with answ'ring colours glow  But if a stone the gentle sea divide  Swift ruffling circles curl on ev'ry side  And glimmering fragments of a broken sun  Banks trees and skies in thick disorder run  To clear this doubt to know the world by sight  To find if books or swains report it right  For yet by swains alone the world he knew  Whose feet came wand'ring o'er the nightly dew  He quits his cell the pilgrimstaff he bore  And fix'd the scallop in his hat before  Then with the sun a rising journey went  Sedate to think and watching each event  The morn was wasted in the pathless grass  And long and lonesome was the wild to pass  But when the Southern sun had warm'd the day  A youth came posting o'er a crossing way  His rayment decent his complexion fair  And soft in graceful ringlets wav'd his hair  Then near approaching Father Hail he cry'd  And Hail my Son the reverend Sire reply'd  Words follow'd words from question answer flow'd  And talk of various kind deceiv'd the road  'Till each with other pleas'd and loth to part  While in their age they differ join in heart  Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound  Thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around  Now sunk the sun the closing hour of day  Came onward mantled o'er with sober gray  Nature in silence bid the world repose  When near the road a stately palace rose  There by the moon thro' ranks of trees they pass  Whose verdure crown'd their sloping sides of grass  It chanc'd the noble master of the dome  Still made his house the wand'ring stranger's home  Yet still the kindness from a thirst of praise  Prov'd the vain flourish of expensive ease  The pair arrive the liv'ry'd servants wait  Their lord receives them at the pompous gate  The table groans with costly piles of food  And all is more than hospitably good  Then led to ress the day's long toil they drown  Deep sunk in sleep and silk and heaps of down  At length 'tis morn and at the dawn of day  Along the wide canals the Zephyrs play  Fresh o'er the gay parterres the breezes creep  And shake the neighb'ring wood to banish sleep  Up rise the guests obedient to the call  An early banquet deck'd the splendid hall  Rich luscious wine a golden goblet grac'd  Which the kind master forc'd the guests to taste  Then pleas'd and thankful from the porch they go  And but the landlord none had cause of woe  His cup was vanish'd for in secret guise  The younger guest purloin'd the glitt'ring prize  As one who spies a serpent in his way  Glistning and basking in the Summer ray  Disorder'd stops to shun the danger near  Then walks with faintness on and looks with fear  So seem'd the fire when far upon the road  The shining spoil his wiley partner show'd  He stopp'd with silence walk'd with trembling heart  And much he wish'd but durst not ask to part  Murm'ring he lifts his eyes and thinks it hard  That generous actions meet a base reward  While thus they pass the sun his glory shrouds  The changing skies hang out their sable clouds  A sound in air presag'd approaching rain  And beasts to covert scud across the plain  Warn'd by the signs the wand'ring pair retreat  To seek for shelter at a neighb'ring seat  'Twas built with turrets on a rising ground  And strong and large and unimprov'd around  Its owner's temper tim'rous and severe  Unkind and griping caus'd a desert there  As near the Miser's heavy doors they drew  Fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew  The nimble light'ning mix'd with show'rs began  And o'er their heads loudrolling thunder ran  Here long they knock but knock or call in vain  Driv'n by the wind and batter'd by the rain  At length some pity warm'd the master's breast  'Twas then his threshold first receiv'd a guest  Slow creaking turns the door with jealous care  And half he welcomes in the shivering pair  One frugal faggot lights the naked walls  And Nature's fervor thro' their limbs recals  Bread of the coarsest sort with eager wine  Each hardly granted serv'd them both to dine  And when the tempest first appear'd to cease  A ready warning bid them part in peace  With still remark the pond'ring Hermit view'd  In one so rich a life so poor and rude  And why shou'd such within himself he cry'd  Lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside  But what new marks of wonder soon took place  In ev'ry settling feature of his face  When from his vest the young companion bore  That Cup the gen'rous landlord own'd before  And paid profusely with the precious bowl  The stinted kindness of this churlish soul  But now the clouds in airy tumult fly  The sun emerging opes an azure sky  A fresher green the smelling leaves display  And glitt'ring as they tremble cheer the day  The weather courts them from the poor retreat  And the glad master bolts the wary gate  While hence they walk the Pilgrim's bosom wrought  With all the travel of uncertain thought  His partner's acts without their cause appear  'Twas there a vice and seem'd a madness here  Detesting that and pitying this he goes  Lost and confounded with the various shows  Now night's dim shades again involve the sky  Again the wand'rers want a place to lye  Again they search and find a lodging nigh  The soil improv'd around the mansion neat  And neither poorly low nor idly great  It seem'd to speak its master's turn of mind  Content and not for praise but virtue kind  Hither the walkers turn with weary feet  Then bless the mansion and the master greet  Their greeting fair bestow'd with modest guise  The courteous master hears and thus replies  Without a vain without a grudging heart  To him who gives us all I yield a part  From him you come for him accept it here  A frank and sober more than costly cheer  He spoke and bid the welcome table spread  Then talk'd of virtue till the time of bed  When the grave houshold round his hall repair  Warn'd by a bell and close the hours with pray'r  At length the world renew'd by calm repose  Was strong for toil the dappled morn arose  Before the pilgrims part the younger crept  Near the clos'd cradle where an infant slept  And writh'd his neck the landlord's little pride  O strange return grew black and gasp'd and dy'd  Horror of horrors what I his only son  How look'd our Hermit when the fact was done  Not hell tho' hell's black jaws in sunder part  And breathe blue fire cou'd more assault his heart  Confus'd and struck with silence at the deed  He flies but trembling fails to fly with speed  His steps the youth pursues the country lay  Perplex'd with roads a servant show'd the way  A river cross'd the path the passage o'er  Was nice to find the servant trod before  Long arms of oaks an open bridge supply'd  And deep the waves beneath the bending glide  The youth who seem'd to watch a time to sin  Approach'd the careless guide and thrust him in  Plunging he falls and rising lifts his head  Then flashing turns and sinks among the dead  Wild sparkling rage inflames the father's eyes  He bursts the bands of fear and madly cries  Detested wretchbut scarce his speech began  When the strange partner seem'd no longer man  His youthful face grew more serenely sweet  His robe turn'd white and flow'd upon his feet  Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair  Celestial odours breathe thro' purpled air  And wings whose colours glitter'd on the day  Wide at his back their gradual plumes display  The form etherial bursts upon his sight  And moves in all the majesty of light  Tho' loud at first the pilgrim's passion grew  Sudden he gaz'd and wist not what to do  Surprize in secret chains his word suspends  And in a calm his settling temper ends  But silence here the beauteous angel broke  The voice of music ravish'd as he spoke  Thy pray'r thy praise thy life to vice unknown  In sweet memorial rise before the throne  These charms success in our bright region find  And force an angel down to calm thy mind  For this commission'd I forsook the sky  Nay cease to kneelthy fellowservant I  Then know the truth of government divine  And let these scruples be no longer thine  The Maker justly claims that world he made  In this the right of providence is laid  Its sacred majesty thro' all depends  On using second means to work his ends  'Tis thus withdrawn in state from human eye  The Pow'r exerts his attributes on high  Your actions uses nor controuls your will  And bids the doubting sons of men be still  What strange events can strike with more surprize  Than those which lately strook thy wond'ring eyes  Yet taught by these confess th'Almighty just  And where you can't unriddle learn to trust  The Great Vain Man who far'd on costly food  Whose life was too luxurious to be good  Who made his iv'ry stands with goblets shine  And forc'd his guests to morning draughts of Wine  Has with the Cup the graceless custom lost  And still he welcomes but with less of cost  The mean suspicious Wretch whose bolted door  Ne'er mov'd in duty to the wand'ring poor  With him I left the cup to teach his mind  That Heav'n can bless if mortals will be kind  Conscious of wanting worth he views the bowl  And feels compassion touch his grateful soul  Thus artists melt the sullen oar of lead  With heaping coals of fire upon its head  In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow  And loose from dross the silver runs below  Long had our pious Friend in virtue trod  But now the child halfwean'd his heart from God  Child of his age for him he liv'd in pain  And measur'd back his steps to earth again  To what excesses had his dotage run  But God to save the father took the son  To all but thee in fits he seem'd to go  And 'twas my ministry to deal the blow  The poor fond parent humbled in the dust  Now owns in tears the punishment was just  But how had all his fortune felt a wrack  Had that false servant sped in safety back  This night his treasur'd heaps he meant to steal  And what a fund of charity wou'd fail  Thus Heav'n instructs thy mind this trial o'er  Depart in peace resign and sin no more  On sounding pinions here the youth withdrew  The sage stood wond'ring as the Seraph flew  Thus look'd Elisha when to mount on high  His master took the chariot of the sky  The fiery pomp ascending left the view  The prophet gaz'd and wish'd to follow too  The bending Hermit here a pray'r begun  "Lord as in heav'n on earth thy will be done"  Then gladly turning sought his ancient place  And pass'd a life of piety and peace  VISIONS PUBLISH'D IN THE SPECTATORS c BY THE SAME HAND  VISION I SPECTATOR N  o    Decipimur Specie Recti  HOR  OUR defects and follies are too often unknown to us nay they are so far from being known to us that they pass for demonstrations of our worth This makes us easy in the midst of them fond to shew them fond to improve in them and to be esteemed for them Then it is that a thousand unaccountable con∣ceits gay inventions and extravagant actions must af∣ford us pleasures and display as to others in the colours which we ourselves take a fancy to glory in and in∣deed there is something so amusing for the time in this state of vanity and illgrounded satisfaction that even the wiser world has chosen an exalted word to describe its enchantments and called it THE PARADISE OF FOOLS Perhaps the latter part of this reflection may seem a false thought to some and bear another turn  than what I have given but it is at present none of my business to look after it who am going to confess that I have been lately amongst them in a vision  Methought I was transported to a hill green flowery and of an easy ascent Upon the broad top of it resided squinteyed ERROR and popular OPINION with many heads two that dealt in sorcery and were famous for bewitching people with the love of themselves To these repaired a multitude from every side by two dif∣ferent paths which lead towards each of them Some who had the most assuming air went directly of them∣selves to ERROR without expecting a conductor o∣thers of a softer nature went first to popular OPINION from whence as she influenced and engaged them with their own praises she delivered them over to his go∣vernment  When we had ascended to an open part of the sum∣mit where OPINION abode we found her entertaining several who had arrived before us Her voice was plea∣sing she breathed odours as she spoke she seemed to have a tongue for every one every one thought he heard of something that was valuable in himself and expected a paradise which she promised as the reward of his merit Thus we were drawn to follow her 'till she should bring us where it was to be bestowed and it was observable that all the way we went the com∣pany was either praising themselves in their qualifica∣tions or one another for those qualifications which they  took to be conspicuous in their own characters or dis∣praising others for wanting theirs or vying in the de∣grees of them  At last we approached a bower at the entrance of which ERROR was seated The trees were thick wo∣ven and the place where he sat artfully contrived to darken him a little He was disguised in a whitish robe which he had put on that he might appear to us with a nearer resemblance to TRUTH and as she has a light whereby she manifests the beauties of nature to the eyes of her adorers so he had provided himself with a magi∣cal wand that he might do something in imitation of it and please with delusions This he listed solemnly and muttering to himself bid the glories which he kept un∣der enchantment to appear before us Immediately we cast our eyes on that part of the sky to which he pointed and observed a thin blue prospect which cleared as mountains in a Summer morning when the mists go off and the palace of VANITY appeared to sight  The foundation hardly seemed a foundation but a set of curling clouds which it stood upon by magical contrivance The way by which we ascended was paint∣ed like a rainbow and as we went the breeze that play∣ed about us bewitched the senses The walls were gild∣ed all for show the lowest set of pillars were of the slight fine Corinthian order and the top of the build∣ing being rounded bore so far the resemblance of a bubble  At the gate the travellers neither met with a porter nor waited 'till one should appear every one thought his merits a sufficient passport and pressed forward In the hall we met with several phantoms that rov'd a∣mongst us and rang'd the company according to their sentiments There was decreasing HONOUR that had nothing to shew in but an old coat of his ancestor's at∣chievements there was OSTENTATION that made himself his own constant subject and GALLANTRY strutting upon his tiptoes At the upper end of the hall stood a throne whose canopy glitter'd with all the riches that gayety could contrive to lavish on it and between the gilded arms sat VANITY deck'd in the Pea∣cock's feathers and acknowledged for another Venus by her votaries The boy who stood beside her for a Cupid and who made the world to bow before her was called SELFCONCEIT His eyes had every now and then a cast inwards to the neglect of all objects about him and the arms which he made use of for conquest were borrowed from those against whom he had a de∣sign The arrow which he shot at the soldier was fledg'd from his own plume of feathers the dart he di∣rected against the man of wit was winged from the quills he writ with and that which he sent against those who presumed upon their riches was headed with gold out of their treasuries he made nets for statesmen from their own contrivances he took fire from the eyes of ladies with which he melted their  hearts and lightning from the tongues of the eloquent to enflame them with their own glories At the foot of the throne sat three false Graces FLATTERY with a shell of paint AFFECTATION with a mirrour to prac∣tise at and FASHION ever changing the posture of her cloaths These applied themselves to secure the con∣quests which SELFCONCEIT had gotten and had each of them their particular polities FLATTERY gave new colours and complexions to all things AFFECTATION new airs and appearances which as she said were not vulgar and FASHION both concealed some home de∣fects and added some foreign external beauties  As I was reflecting upon what I saw I heard a voice in the crowd bemoaning the condition of man∣kind which is thus managed by the breath of OPINION deluded by ERROR  ir'd by SELFCONCEIT and given up to be trained in all the courses of VANITY 'till SCORN or POVERTY come upon us These expressions were no sooner handed about but I immediately saw a general disorder till at last there was a parting in one place and a grave old man decent and resolute was led forward to be punished for the words he had uttered He appeared inclined to have spoken in his own defence but I could not observe that any one was willing to hear him VANITY cast a scornful smile athim SELFCONCEIT was angry FLATTERY who knew him for PLAINDEALING put on a vizard and turned away AFFECTATION tossed her fan made mouths and cal∣led  him ENVY or SLANDER and FASHION would have it that at least he must be ILLMANNERS Thus slight∣ed and despised by all he was driven out for abusing people of merit and figure and I heard it firmly resolv∣ed that he should be used no better whereever they met with him hereafter  I had already seen the meaning of most part of that warning which he had given and was considering how the latter words should be fulfilled when a mighty noise was heard without and the door was blackned by a numerous train of harpies crowding in upon us FOLLY and BROKEN CREDIT were seen in the house before they entered TROUBLE SHAME INFAMY SCORN and POVERTY brought up the rear VANITY with her Cupid and Graces disappeared her subjects ran into holes and corners but many of them were found and carried off as I was told by one who stood near me either to prisons or cellars solitude or little company the mean arts or the viler crafts of life But these added he with a disdainful air are such who would fondly live here when their merits neither matched the lustre of the place nor their riches its expences We have seen such scenes as these before now the glory you saw will all return when the hurry is over I thank'd him for his information and be∣lieving him so incorrigible as that he would stay till it was his turn to be taken I made off to the door and overtook some few who though they would not hear∣ken  to PLAINDEALING were now terrified to good purpose by the example of others but when they had touched the threshold it was a strange shock to them to find that the delusion of ERROR was gone and they plainly discerned the building to hang a little up in the air without any real foundation At first we saw no∣thing but a desperate leap remained for us and I a thou∣sand times blamed my unmeaning curiosity that had brought me into so much danger But as they began to sink lower in their own minds methought the pa∣lace sunk along with us till they were arrived at the due point of ESTEEM which they ought to have for themselves then the part of the building in which they stood touched the earth and we departing out it re∣tired from our eyes Now whether they who stayed in the palace were sensible of this descent I cannot tell it was then my opinion that they were not However it be my dream broke up at it and has given me oc∣casion all my life to reflect upon the fatal consequences of following the suggestions of VANITY  VISION II SPECTATOR N  o    HOW are we tortured with the absence of what we covet to possess when it appears to be lost to us what excursions does the soul make in imagina∣tion after it and how does it turn into itself again more foolishly fond and dejected at the disappoint∣ment our grief instead of having recourse to reason which might restrain it searches to find a further nou∣rishment It calls upon memory to relate the several passages and circumstances of satisfactions which we formerly enjoyed the pleasures we purchased by those riches that are taken from us or the power and splen∣dour of our departed honours or the voice the words the looks the temper and affections of our friends that are deceased It needs must happen from hence that the passion should often swell to such a size as to burst the heart which contains it if time did not make these circumstances less strong and lively so that reason should become a more equal match for the passion or  if another desire which becomes more present did not overpower them with a livelier representation These are thoughts which I had when I fell into a kind of vision upon this subject and may therefore stand for a proper introduction to a relation of it  I found myself upon a naked shore with company whose afflicted countenances witnessed their conditions Before us flowed a water deep silent and called the ri∣ver of TEARS which issuing from two fountains on an upper ground encompassed an island that lay before us The boat which plied in it was old and shatter'd having been sometimes overset by the impatience and haste of single passengers to arrive at the other side This immediately was brought to us by MISFORTUNE who steers it and we were all preparing to take our places when there appeared a woman of a mild and composed behaviour who began to deter us from it by representing the dangers which would attend our voyage Hereupon some who knew her for PATIENCE and some of those too who 'till then cry'd the loudest were persuaded by her and return'd back The rest of us went in and she whose goodnature would not suffer her to forsake persons in trouble desired leave to ac∣company us that she might at least administer some small comfort or advice while we sailed We were no sooner embarked but the boat was pushed off the sheet was spread and being filled with sighs which are the winds of that country we made a passage to the far∣ther  bank thro' several difficulties of which t of us seem'd utterly regardless  When we landed we perceived the island to be strangely overcast with fogs which no brightness could pierce so that a kind of gloomy horror sat al∣ways brooding over it This had something in it very shocking to easy tempers insomuch that some others whom PATIENCE had by this time gain'd over left us here and privily convey'd themselves round the verge of the island to find a ford by which she told them they might escape  For my part I still went along with those who were for piercing into the centre of the place and joining ourselves to others whom we found upon the same journey we marched solemnly as at a funeral thro' bordering hedges of rosemary and thro' a grove of yewtrees which love to overshadow tombs and flou∣rish in churchyards Here we heard on every side the wailings and complaints of several of the inhabitants who had cast themselves disconsolately at the feet of trees and as we chanc'd to approach any of these we might perceive them wringing their hands beating their breasts tearing their hair or after some other manner visibly agitated with vexation Our sorrows were heigh∣tened by the influence of what we heard and saw and one of our number was wrought up to such a pitch of wildness as to talk of hanging himself upon a bough which shot temptingly across the path we travelled in  but he was restrain'd from it by the kind endeavours of our abovementioned companion  We had now gotten into the most dusky silent part of the island and by the redoubled sounds of sighs which made a doleful whistling in the branches the thickness of air which occasioned faintish respiration and the violent throbbings of heart which more and more affected us we found that we approach'd the GROTTO OF GRIEF It was a wide hollow and me∣lancholy cave sunk deep in a dale and watered by ri∣vulets that had a colour between red and black These crept slow and half congealed amongst its windings and mixed their heavy murmur with the echo of groans that rolled thro' all the passages In the most retired part of it sat the DOLEFUL BEING herself the path to her was strewed with goads stings and thorns and the throne on which she sat was broken into a rock with ragged pieces pointing upwards for her to lean upon A heavy mist hung above her her head oppressed with it reclined upon her arm thus did she reign over her disconsolate subjects full of herself to stupidity in e∣ternal pensiveness and the profoundest silence On one side of her stood DEJECTION just dropping into a swoon and PALENESS wasting to a skeleton on the other side were CARE inwardly tormented with imagi∣nations and ANGUISH suffering outward TROUBLES to suck the blood from her heart in the shape of VUL∣TURES The whole vault had a genuine dismalness in  it which a few scattered lamps whose blueish flames arose and sunk in their urns discovered to our eyes with encrease Some of us fell down overcome and spent with what they suffer'd in the way and were gi∣ven over to those tormenters that stood on either hand of the presence others galled and mortified with pain recover'd the entrance where PATIENCE whom we had left behind was still waiting to receive us  With her whose company was now become more grateful to us by the want we had found of her we winded round the grotto and ascended at the back of it out of the mournful dale in whose bottom it lay On this eminence we halted by her advice to pant for breath and listing our eyes which till then were fixed downwards felt a sullen sort of satisfaction in observing thro' the shades what numbers had entered the island This satisfaction which appears to have illnature in it was excusable because it happened at a time when we were too much taken up with our own concern to have respect to that of others and there∣fore we did not consider them as suffering but our∣selves as not suffering in the most forlorn estate It had also the groundwork of humanity and compassion in it though the mind was then too deeply engaged to perceive it but as we proceeded onwards it began to discover itself and from observing that others were un∣happy we came to question one another when it was that we met and what were the sad occasions that  brought us together Then we heard our stories we compared them we mutually gave and received pity and so by degrees became tolerable company  A considerable part of the troublesome road was thus deceived at length the openings among the trees grew larger the air seemed thinner it lay with less oppres∣sion upon us and we could now and then discern tracts in it of a lighter greyness like the breakings of day short in duration much enlivening and called in that country GLEAMS OF AMUSEMENT Within a short while these gleams began to appear more frequent and then brighter and of a longer continuance the SIGHS that hitherto filled the air with so much dolefulness al∣tered to the sound of common breezes and in general the horrors of the island were abated  When we had arrived at last at the ford by which we were to pass out we met with those fashionable mourners who had been ferried over along with us and who being unwilling to go as far as we had coast∣ed by the shore to find the place where they waited our coming that by shewing themselves to the world only at that time when we did they might seem also to have been among the troubles of the grotto Here the waters that rolled on the other side so deep and si∣lent were much dried up and it was an easter matter for us to wade over  The river being crossed we were received upon the further bank by our friends and acquaintance whom  COMFORT had brought out to congratulate our appear∣ance in the world again Some of these blamed us for staying so long away from them others advised us a∣gainst all temptations of going back again every one was cautious not to renew our trouble by asking any particulars of the journey and all concluded that in a case of so much affliction we could not have made choice of a fitter companion than PATIENCE Here PATIENCE appearing serene at her praises delivered us over to COMFORT COMFORT smiled at his re∣ceiving the charge immediately the sky purpledon that side to which he turned and double day at once broke in upon me  VISION III GUARDIAN N  o    Quid mentem traxisse polo quid profuit altum  Erexisse caput pecudum si more pererrant  CLAUD  I Was considering last night when I could not sleep how noble a part of the creation Man was design'd to be and how distinguished in all his actions above other earthly creatures From whence I fell to take a view of the change and corruption which he has in∣troduced into his own condition the groveling appe∣tites the mean characters of sense and wild courses of passions that cast him from the degree in which Pro∣vidence had placed him the debasing himself with qua∣lifications not his own and his degenerating into a lower sphere of action This inspired me with a mix∣ture of contempt and anger which however was not so violent as to hinder the return of sleep but grew confused as that came upon me and made me end my  reflections with giving mankind the opprobrious names of inconsiderate mad and foolish  Here methought where my waking reason left the subject my fancy pursued it in a dream and I ima∣gined myself in a loud soliloquy of passion railing at my species and walking hard to get rid of the com∣pany I despised when two men who had overheard me made up on either hand These I observed had many features in common which might occasion the mistake of the one for the other in those to whom they appear single but I who saw them together could ea∣sily perceive that tho' there was an air of severity in each it was tempered with a natural sweetness in the one and by turns constrained or tussled by the designs of malice in the other  I was at a loss to know the reason of their joining me so briskly when he whose appearance displeased me most thus addressed his companion Pray brother let him alone and we shall immediately see him trans∣formed into a Tyger This struck me with horror which the other perceived and pitying my disorder bid me be of good courage for tho' I had been savage in my treatment of mankind whom I should rather reform than rail against he would however endeavour to re∣scue me from my danger At this I looked a little more chearful and while I testified my resignation to him ve saw the angry brother sling away from us in a pas∣sion for his disappointment Being now left to my  friend I went back with him at his desire that might know the meaning of those words which so affright∣ted me  As we went along to inform you says he with whom you have this adventure my name is REPROOF and his REPROACH both born of the same mother but of different fathers TRUTH is our common parent FRIENDSHIP who saw her fell in love with her and she being pleased with him he begat me upon her but a while after ENMITY lying in ambush for her be∣came the father of him whom you saw along with me The temper of our mother enclines us to the fame sort of business the informing mankind of their faults but the differing complexions of our fathers make us dif∣fer in our designs and company I have a natural be∣nevolence in my mind which engages me with friends and he a natural impetuosity in his which casts him among enemies  As he thus discoursed he came to a place where there were three entrances into as many several walks which lay beside one another We passed into the middlemost a plain strait regular walk set with trees which ad∣ded to the beauty of the place but did not so close their boughs over head as to exclude the light from it Here as we walked I was made to observe how the road on one hand was full of rocks and precipices o∣ver which REPROACH who had already gotten thither was furiously driving unhappy wretches the other side  was all laid out in gardens of gaudy tulips amongst whose leaves the serpents wreath'd and at the end of every grassy walk the enchantress FLATTERY was weav∣ing bowers to lull souls asleep in We continued still walking on the middle way 'till we arrived in a build∣ing in which it terminated This was formerly erected by TRUTH for a watch tower from whence she took a view of the earth and as she saw occasion sent out REPROOF or even REPROACH for our reformation Over the door I took notice that a face was carved with a heart upon the lips of it and presently call'd to mind that this was the ancients emblem of SINCERITY In the entrance I met with FREEDOM OF SPEECH and COMPLAISANCE who had for a long time looked upon one another as enemies but REPROOF has so happily brought them together that they now act as friends and fellowagents in the same family Before I ascend∣ed up the stairs I had my eyes purified by a water which made me see extremely clear and I think they said it sprung in a pit from whence as Democritus had reported they formerly brought up TRUTH who had hid herself in it I was then admitted to the upper chamber of prospect which was called THE KNOW∣LEDGE OF MANKIND here the window was no sooner opened but I perceived the clouds to roll off and part before me and a scene of all the variety of the world presented itself  But how different was mankind in this view from  what it used to appear methought the very shape of most of them was lost some had the heads of Dogs o∣thers of Apes or Parrots and in short whereever any one took upon him the inferior and unworthy qualities of other creatures the change of his soul became vi∣sible in his countenance The strutting pride of him who is endued with brutality instead of courage made his face shoot out in the form of a Horse's his eyes be∣came prominent his nostrils widened and his wig un∣tying flowed down on one side of his neck in a waving mane The talkativeness of those who love the illna∣ture of conversation made them turn into assemblies of Geese their lips hardened into bills by eternal us∣ing they gabbled for diversion they hiss'd in scandal and their ruffles falling back on their arms a succession of little feathers appeared which formed wings for them to flutter with from one visit to another The envious and malicious lay on the ground with the heads of different sorts of Serpents and not endeavouring to erect themselves but meditating mischief to others they suck'd the poison of the earth sharpened their tongues to stings upon the stones and rolled their trains unperceivably beneath their habits The hypo∣critical oppressors wore the faces of Crocodiles their mouths were instruments of cruelty their eyes of de∣ceit they committed wickedness and bemoaned that there should be so much of it in the world they de∣voured the unwary and wept over the remains of them  The covetous had so hook'd and worn their fingers by counting interest upon interest that they converted to the claws of Harpies and these they still were stretch∣ing out for more yet seem'd unsatisfied with their ac∣quisitions The sharpers had the looks of Camelions they every minute changed their appearance and fed on swarms of Flies which fell as so many Collies a∣mongst them The bully seemed a dunghil Cock he crested well and bore his comb aloft he was beaten by almost every one yet still sung for triumph and only the mean coward prick'd up the ears of a Hare to fly before him Critics were turned into Cats whose plea∣sure and grumbling go together Fopes were Apes in embroidered jackets Flatterers were curled Spaniels sawning and crouching The crafty had the face of a Fox the slothful of an Ass the cruel of a Wolf the illbred of a bear the leachers were Goats and the gluttons Swine Drunkenness was the only vice that did not change the face of its professors into that of another creature but this I took to be far from a pri∣vilege for these two reasons because it sufficiently deforms them of itself and because none of the lower ranks of beings is guilty of so foolish an intempe∣rance  As I was taking a view of these representations of things without any more order than is usual in a dream or in the confusion of the world itself I per∣ceived a concern within me for what I saw my eyes  began to moisten and as if the virtue of that water with which they were purified was lost for a time by their being touched with that which arose from a pas∣sion the clouds immediately began to gather again and close from either hand upon the prospect I then turn∣ed towards my guide who addressed himself to me af∣ter this manner You have seen the condition of man∣kind when it descends from its dignity now there∣fore guard yourself from that degeneracy by a modest greatness of spirit on one side and a conscious shame on the other Endeavour also with a generosity of goodness to make your friends aware of it let them know what defects you perceive are growing upon them handle the matter as you see reason either with the airs of severe or humourous affection sometimes plainly describing the degeneracy in its full proper co∣lours or at other times letting them know that if they proceed as they have begun you give them to such a day or so many months to turn Bears Wolves or Foxes c Neither neglect your more remote ac∣quaintance where you see any worthy and susceptible of admonition expose the beasts whose qualities you see them putting on where you have no mind to en∣gage with their persons The possibility of their ap∣plying this is very obvious the Egyptians saw it so clearly that they made the pictures of animals explain their minds to one another instead of writing and  indeed it is hardly to be missed since Aesop took them out of their mute condition and taught them to speak for themselves with relation to the actions of mankind  VISION IV GUARDIAN N  o    THERE is a sett of mankind who are wholly employed in the illnatured office of gathering up a collection of stories that lessen the reputation of others and spreading them abroad with a certain air of satisfaction Perhaps indeed an innocent and unmean∣ing curiosity a desire of being informed concerning those we live with or a willingness to prosit by reflection upon the actions of others may sometimes afford an excuse or sometimes a defence for inquisitiveness but certainly it is beyond all excuse a transgression against huma∣nity to carry the matter further to tear off the dres∣sings as I may say from the wounds of a friend and expose them to the air in cruel fits of diversion and yet we have something more to bemoan an outrage of an higher nature which mankind is guilty of when they are not content to spread the stories of folly frail∣ty and vice but even enlarge them or invent new ones and blacken characters that we may appear ri∣diculous  or hateful to one another From such prac∣tices as these it happens that some feel a sorrow and others are agitated with a spirit of revenge that scan∣dals or lies are told because another has told such be∣fore that resentments and quarrels arise and injuries are given received and multiplied in a scene of ven∣geance  All this I have often observed with abundance of concern and having a perfect desire to further the hap∣piness of mankind I lately set myself to consider the causes from whence such evils arise and the remedies which may be applied Whereupon I shut my eyes to prevent distraction from outward objects and a while after shot away upon an impulse of thought into the WORLD OF IDEAS where abstracted qualities became visible in such appearances as wer agreeable to each of their natures  That part of the country where I happened to light was the most noisy that I had ever known The winds whistled the leaves rustled the brooks rumbled the birds chatter'd the tongues of men were heard and the echo mingled something of every sound in its repe∣tition so that there was a strange confusion and up∣roar of sounds about me At length as the noise still encreased I could discern a man habited like a herald and as I afterwards understood called NOVELTY that came forward proclaiming a solemn day to be kept at the house of COMMON FAME Immediately behind him  advanced three nymphs who had mostrous appear∣ances The first of these was CURIOSITY habited like a virgin and having an hundred ears upon her head to serve in her inquiries The second of these was TAL∣KATIVENESS a little better grown she seemed to be like a young wife and had an hundred tongues to spread her stories The third was CENSORIOUSNESS habited like a widow and surrounded with an hundred squinting eyes of a malignant influence which so ob∣liquely darted on all around that it was impossible to say which of them had brought in the informations she boasted of These as I was informed had been very instrumental in preserving and rearing COMMON FAME when upon her birthday she was shuffled into a crowd to escape the search which TRUTH might have made after her and her parents CURIOSITY found here there TALKATIVENESS convey'd her a∣way and CENSORIOUSNESS so nursed her up that in a short time she grew to a prodigious size and obtain∣ed an empire over the universe wherefore the POWER in gratitude for these services has since advanced them to her highest employments The next who came for∣ward in this procession was a light damsel called CRE∣DULITY who carried behind them the lamp the sil∣ver vessel with a spout and other instruments proper for this solemn occasion She had formerly seen these three together and conjecturing from the number of their ears tongues and eyes that they might be the  proper Genii of ATTENTION FAMILIAR CONVERSE and OCULAR DEMONSTRATION she from that time gave herself up to attend them The last who followed were some who had closely muffled themselves in up∣per garments so that I could not discern who they were but just as the soremost of them was come up I am glad says she calling me by my name to meet you at this time stay close by me and take a strict ob∣servation of all that passes Her voice was sweet and commanding I thought I had somewhere heard it and from her as I went along I learned the meaning of every thing which offered  We now marched forward thro' the ROOKERY OF RUMOURS which flew thick and with a terrible din all around us At length we arrived at the house of COMMON FAME where a hecatomb of REPUTATIONS was that day to fall for her pleasure The house stood upon an eminence having a thousand passages to it and a thousand whispering holes for the conveyance of found The hall we entered was formed with the art of a music chamber for the improvement of noises REST and SILENCE are banished the place STORIES of different natures wander in light flocks all about sometimes truths and lies or sometimes lies themselves clashing against one another In the middle stood a table painted after the manner of the remotest Asiatic countries upon which the lamp the silver vessel and cups of a white earth were planted in order Then  dried herbs were brought collected for the solemnity in moonshine and water being put to them there was a greenish liquor made to which they added the flower of milk and an extraction from the canes of America for performing a libation to the infer∣nal POWERS OF MISCHIEF After this CURIOSITY retiring to a withdrawingroom brought forth the VICTIMS being to appearance a sett of small waxen images which she laid upon the table one after ano∣ther Immediately TALKATIVENESS gave each of them the name of some one whom for the time they were to represent and CENSORIOUSNESS stuck them all about with black pins still pronouncing at every one she stuck something to the prejudice of the per∣sons represented No sooner were these rites perform∣ed and incantations uttered but the sound of a speak∣ing trumpet was heard in the air by which they knew the Deity of the place was propitiated and assisting Upon this the sky grew darker a storm arose and mur∣murs sighs groans cries and the words of grief or re∣sentment were heard within it Thus the three Sor∣ceresses discovered that they whose names they had given to the images were already affected with what was done to them in essigy The knowledge of this was received with the loudest laughter and in many congratulatory words they applauded one another's wit and power  As matters were at this high point of disorder the  muffled lady whom I attended on being no longer able to endure such barbarous proceedings threw off her upper garment of RESERVE and appeared to be TRUTH As soon as she had confessed herself present the speaking trumpet ceas'd to sound the sky cleared up the storm abated the noises which were heard in it ended the laughter of the company was over and a serene light till then unknown to the place was dif∣fused around it At this the detected Sorceresses en∣deavoured to escape in a cloud which I saw began to thicken about them but it was soon dispersed their charms being controuled and prevailed over by the su∣perior Divinity For my part I was exceedingly glad to see it so and began to consider what punishments she would inflict upon them I fancied it would be proper to cut off CURIOSITY'S ears and six them to the eaves of the houses to nail the tongue of TALKATIVENESS to Indian tables and to put out the eyes of CENSO∣RIOUSNESS with a flash of her light In respect of CREDULITY I had indeed some little pity and had I been judge she might perhaps have escaped with a hearty reproof  But I soon found that the discerning Judge had o∣ther designs she knew them for such as will not be de∣stroyed entirely while mankind is in being and yet ought to have a brand and punishment affixed to them that they may be avoided Wherefore she took a seat for judgment and had the Criminals brought forward  by SHAME ever blushing and TROUBLE with a whip of many lashes two phantoms who had dogged the Procession in disguise and waited till they had an au∣thority from TRUTH to lay hands upon them Imme∣diately then she ordered CURIOSITY and TALKATIVE∣NEES to be fettered together that the one should never suffer the other to rest nor the other ever let her re∣main undiscovered Light CREDULITY she linkt to SHAME at the tormenter's own request who was pleas∣ed to be thus secure that her prisoner should not e∣scape and this was done partly for her punishment and partly for her amendment CENSORIOUSNESS was also in like manner begged by TROUBLE and had her assign'd for an eternal companion After they were thus chain'd with one another by the judge's order she drove them from the presence to wander for ever thro' the world with NOVELTY stalking before them  The cause being now over she retreated from sight within the splendor of her own glory which leaving the house it had brightned the sounds that were pro∣per to the place began to be as loud and consused as when we entered and there being no longer a clear distinguished appearance of any objects represented to me I returned from the excursion I had made in fancy  VISION V  WHATEVER industry and eagerness the modern discoverers have shewn for the knowledge of new countries there yet remains an ample field in the creation to which they are utter strangers and which all the methods of travelling hitherto invented will never bring them acquainted with Of this I can give a very particular instance in an accident which lately happened to me  As I was on the th of this instant being Febru∣ary walking with my eyes cast upward I fell into a reflection on the vast tracts of air which ap∣pear'd before me as uninhabited And wherefore said I to myself shou'd all this space be created can it only be for an odd bird to fly through as now and then a man may pass a desart Or are there also kingdoms with their particular polities and people of a species which we know nothing of ordain'd to live in it  It was in this manner I continued my thought when my feet forsook the level and I was insensibly mounted in the air till I arriv'd at a footing as firm  and level as what I had left But with what surprize did I find myself among creatures distinct from us in shape and customs  The inhabitants are of a small stature below those which history describes for Pigmies The tallest of them exceed not fourteen or fifteen inches and the least are hardly three This difference proceeds only from their growth before they are brought to light for af∣ter we never observe them to grow unless it please their parents who have this uncommon method of enabling them they recall them to the womb where having been for some time they receive an addition to their bulk then go back to their houses and continue at a stand as they did before The experiment has been often try'd with success but some have suffered ex∣tremely by undergoing it  Their skins are like the ancient Britain all drawn over with a variety of figures The colour made use of for this end is generally black I have indeed observ∣ed in some of the religious and lawyers of the country red here and there intermingled tho' not so common∣ly of late They tell me too they often us'd to paint with all colours and I visited two or three of the old inhabitants who were adorn'd in that fashion but this is now disused since the new inventions by which the use of a black fountain that belongs to that coun∣try is render'd more useful and serviceable  The Cloaths in which they go clad are the skins  of beasts worn by some plain by others with figure wrought upon them Gold is also made use of by some to beautify their apparel but very seldom silver un∣less as buckles are by us for fastening the garment be∣fore I have seen some of them go like seamen in thin blue shirts others like Indians in a partycolour'd loose kind of apparel and others who they told me were the Politicians of the country go about stark naked  The manner of dressing them is this at first when they come into the world they have a suit given them which if it do not fit exactly is not as with us fitted up again but the children are in a cruel manner cut and squeez'd to bring them to its proportion Yet this they seem not much to regard provided their princi∣pal parts are not affected When the dress is thus set∣tled on them they are clad for life it being seldom their custom to alter it or put it off in short they live in it night and day and wear it to rags rather than part with it being sure of the same torture and a great∣er danger if they should be dress'd a second time I have further taken notice that they delight to go o∣pen breasted most of them shewing their bosoms speck∣led Some Lawyers indeed wear them quite white perhaps for distinction sake or to be known at a dis∣tance But the finest shew is among the beaux and la∣dies who mightily affect something of gold both be∣fore and behind them  Food I never saw them eat they being a people  who as I observed live in air their houses are all single and high having no back rooms but frequent∣ly seven or eight stories which are all separate houses above one another They have one gate to their city and generally no doors to their houses tho' I have sometimes seen them have particular doors and even made of glass where the inhabitants have been ob∣serv'd to stand many days that their fine apparel may be seen thro' them If at any time they lie down which they do when they come from their habitations as if coming abroad were their greatest fatigue they will lie together in heaps without receiving hurt though the soundest sleep they get is when they can have dust e∣nough to cover them over  The females amongst them are but few nothing be∣ing there produced by a marriage of sexes The males are of a different strength or endowment of parts some having knowledge in an extream degree and others none at all yet at the same time they are mighty pre∣tenders to instruct others Their Names for as many as wou'd discover them to me I observ'd to be the very same as ours are upon earth I met a few who made theirs a mystery but why I am yet to learn They are so communicative that they will tell all the knowledge they boast if a stranger apply himself to their conversation and this may be worth his while if he considers that all languages arts and sciences are profest amongst them I think I may say it with∣out  vanity that I knew a certain Talisman with pro∣per figures and characters inscrib'd whereby their great∣est people may be charm'd brought to reside with a man and serve him like a familiar in the conduct of life  There is no such thing as fighting amongst them but their controversies are determin'd by words where∣in they seldom own themselves conquer'd yet proceed no further than two or three replies perhaps indeed two others take up their neighbour's quarrel but then they desist too after the same manner sometimes how∣ever blows have ensu'd upon their account though not amongst them in such a case they have descended to inspire mankind with their sentiments and chosen champions from among us in order to decide it  The time of their life is very different some die as soon as born and others in their youth some get a new lease of life by their entring into the womb again and if any weather it out to a hundred years they ge∣nerally live on to an extreme age After which it is remarkable that instead of growing weaker as we do by time they increase in strength and become at last so confirm'd in health that it is the opinion of their country they never can perish while the world re∣mains  The sicknesses which may take them of besides what happens from their natural weakness of body are of different sorts One is overmoisture which affec∣ting their mansions makes them lose their complexi∣ons  become deform'd and rot away insensibly this is often obviated by their not keeping too much with∣in doors Another is the Worms which prey upon their bowels if they be maimed by accidents they become like us so far useless and that maim will some time or other be the occasion of their ruin However they perish by these means only in appearance and like spirits who vanish in one place to be seen in a∣nother But as men die of passions so Disesteem is what the most nearly touches them then they with∣draw into holes and corners and consume away in darkness Or if they are kept alive a few days by the force of Spices it is but a short reprieve from their perishing to eternity without any honour but that instead of a burial a small pyre of Past should be erec∣ted over them while they like the antient Romans are reduc'd to ashes  N B This Vision is to be understood of a Library of Books  THE LIFE OF ZOILUS AND HIS REMARKS ON HOMER'S BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE  VIDE QUAM INIQUI SUNT DIVINORUM MUNERUM AESTIMATO∣RES ETIAM QUIDAM PROFESSI SAPIENTIAM  SENECA  PREFACE  HAVING some time ago heard that the Translation of HOMER'S ILIAD would be attempted I resolv'd to confer with the gentleman who undertook it I found him of a tall presence and thoughtful countenance with his hands folded his eyes fix'd and his beard untrimm'd This I took to be a good omen because he thus resembled the Constantino∣politan statue of Homer which Cedrenus describes and sure∣ly nothing cou'd have been liker had he but arriv'd at the character of age and blindness As my business was to be my introduction I told him how much I was acquainted with the secret history of Homer that no one better knows his own horse than I do the camel of Bactria in which his soul resided at the time of the Trojan wars that my acquaintance conti∣nued with him as he appear'd in the person of the Grecian poet that I knew him in his next transmigration into a pea∣cock was pleas'd with his return to manhood under the name of Ennius at Rome and more pleas'd to hear he wou'd soon revive under another name with all his full lustre in England This particular knowledge added I which sprung from the love I bear him has made me fond of a conversation with you in order to the success of your translation  The civil manner in which he received my proposal en∣couraging me to proceed I told him there were arts of suc∣cess as well as merits to obtain it and that he who now dealt in Greek should not only satisfy himself with being a good Grecian but also contrive to hasten into the repute of it He might therefore write in the titlepage TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL GREEK and select a motto for his purpose out of the same language He might obtain a copy of verses written in it to prefix to the work and not call the titles of each book the first and second but ILIAD ALPHA and BETA He might retain some names which the world is least acquainted with as his old translator Chapman uses E∣phaistus  instead of Vulcan Baratrum for Hell and if the notes were filled with Greek verses it wou'd more increase the wonder of many readers Thus I went on when he told me smiling I had shewn him indeed a set of arts very diffe∣rent from merit for which reason he thought he ought not to depend upon them A success says he founded on the ig∣norance of others may bring a temporary advantage but nei¦ther a conscious satisfaction nor future fame to the author Men of sense despise the affectation which they easily see through and even they who were dazzled with it at first are no sooner inform'd of its being an affectation but they ima∣gine it also a veil to cover imperfection  The next point I ventur'd to speak on was the sort of poe∣try he intended to use how some may fancy a poet of the greatest fire would be imitated better in the freedom of blank verse and the description of war sounds more pompous out of rhime But will the translation said he be thus remov'd e∣nough from prose without greater inconveniences what transpositions is Milton forc'd to as an equivalent for want of rhime in the poetry of a language which depends upon a natural order of words And even this would not have done his business had he not given the fullest scope to his genius by chusing a subject upon which there could be no hyperboles We see however he be deservedly successful that the ridi∣cule of his manner succeeds better than the imitation of it because transpositions which are unnatural to a language are to be fairly derided if they ruin it by being frequently in∣troduced and because hyperboles which outrage every les∣ser subject where they are seriously us'd are often beautiful in ridicule Let the French whose language is not copious translate in prose but ours which exceeds it in copiousness of words may have a more frequent likeness of sounds to make the unison or rhime easier a grace of music that atones for the harshness our consonants and monosyllables occasion  After this I demanded what air he would appear with whether antiquated like Chapman's Version or modern like  La Motte's Contraction To which he answer'd by desiring me to observe what a painter does who would always have his pieces in fashion He neither chuses to draw a beauty in a ruff or a Frenchhead but with its neck uncover'd and in its natural ornament of hair curl'd up or spread becoming∣ly so may a writer chuse a natural manner of expressing himself which will always be in fashion without affecting to borrow an odd solemnity and unintelligible pomp from the past times or humouring the present by falling into its af∣fectations and those phrases which are born to die with it  I ask'd him lastly whether he would be strictly literal or expatiate with further licences I would not be literal re∣plies he or ty'd up to line for line in such a manner wherein it is impossible to express in one language what has been de∣liver'd in another Neither wou'd I so expatiate as to alter my Author's sentiments or add others of my own These errors are to be avoided on either hand by adhering not only to the word but the spirit and genius of an author by con∣sidering what he means with what beautiful manner he has express'd his meaning in his own tongue and how he wou'd have express'd himself had it been in ours Thus we ought to seek for Homer in a version of Homer other attempts are but transformations of him such as Ovid tells us where the name is retain'd and the thing alter'd this will be really what you mention'd in the compliment you began with a transmigration of the Poet from one country into another  Here ended the serious part of our conference All I re∣member further was that having ask'd him what he design'd with all those editions and comments I observ'd in his room he made answer that if any one who had a mind to find fault with his performance wou'd but stay 'till it was entirely fi∣nish'd he shou'd have a very cheap bargain of them  Since this discourse I have often resolv'd to try what it was to translate in the spirit of a writer and at last chose THE BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE which is ascrib'd to Homer and bears a nearer resemblance to his Iliad than  the Culex does to the Acneid of Virgil Statius and others think it a work of youth written as a prelude to his greater poems Chapman thinks it the work of his age after he found men ungrateful to shew he cou'd give strength line∣age and fame as he pleas'd and praise a Mouse as well as a Man Thus says he the Poet professedly flung up the world and apply'd himself at last to hymns Now tho' this reason of his may be nothing more than a scheme form'd out of the order in which Homer's works are printed yet does the con∣jecture that this poem was written after the Iliad appear probable because of its frequent allusions to that poem and particularly that there is not a Frog or a Mouse kill'd which has not its parallel instance there in the death of some war∣rior or other  The poem itself is of the Epic kind the time of its action the duration of two days the subject however its nature fri∣volous or ridiculous rais'd by having the most shining words and deeds of Gods and Heroes accommodated to it and while other poems often compare the illustrious exploits of great men to those of brutes this always heightens the sub∣ject by comparisons drawn from things above it We have a great character given it with respect to the fable in Gaddius de Script non Eccles It appears says he nearer perfection than the Iliad or Odysses and excels both in judgment wit and exquisite texture since it is a poem perfect in its own kind Nor does Crusius speak less to its honour with respect to the moral when he cries out in an apostrophe to the reader  Whoever you are mind not the names of these little ani∣mals but look into the things they mean call them men call them kings or counsellors or human polity itself you have here doctrines of every sort  And indeed when I hear the Frog talk concerning the Mouse's family I learn e∣quality shou'd be observ'd in making friendships when I hear the Mouse answer the Frog I remember that a similitude of manners shou'd be regarded in them when I see their coun∣cils assembling I think of the bustles of human prudence  and when I see the battle grow warm and glorious our strug∣gles for honour and empire appear before me  This piece had many imitations of it in antiquity as the sight of the Cats the Cranes the Starlings the Spiders c That of the Cats is in the Bodleian library but I was not so lucky as to find it I have taken the liberty to divide my trans∣lation into books tho' it be otherwise in the original accord∣ing as the fable allow'd proper restingplaces by varying its scene or nature of action this I did after the example of Aristarchus and Zenodotus in the Iliad I then thought of carrying the grammarians example further and placing ar∣guments at the head of each which I fram'd as follows in imitation of the short ancient Greek inscriptions to the Iliad  BOOK I  In ALPHA the ground Of the quarrel is found  BOOK II  In BETA we The council see  BOOK III  Dire GAMMA relates The work of the fates  But as I am averse from all information which lessens our surprize I only mention these for a handle to quarrel with the custom of long arguments before a poem It may be necessary in books of controversy or abstruse learning to write an epi∣tome before each part but it is not kind to forestal us in the work of fancy and make our attention remiss by a previous account of the end of it  The next thing which employ'd my thoughts was the he∣roes names It might perhaps take off somewhat from the majesty of the poem had I cast away such noble sounds as Physignathus Lycopinax and Crambophagus to substitute Bluffcheek Lickdish and Cabbageeater in their places It is for this reason I have retain'd them untranslated however I place them in English before the poem and sometimes give  a sfort character extracted out of their names as in Poly∣phonus Pternophagus c that the reader may not want some light of their humour in the original  But what gave me a greater difficulty was to know how I shou'd follow the poet when he inserted pieces of lines from his Iliad and struck out a sprightliness by their new applica∣tion To supply this in my translation I have added one or two of Homer's particularities and us'd two or three allusi∣ons to some of our English poets who most resemble him to keep up some image of this spirit of the original with an e∣quivalent beauty To use more might make my perfor∣mance seem a cento rather than a translation to those who know not the necessity I lay under  I am not ignorant after all my care how the world re∣ceives the best compositions of this nature A man need only go to a painter's and apply what he hears said of a pic∣ture to a translation to find how he shall be us'd upon his own or his author's account There one spectator tells you a piece is extremely fine but he sets no value on what is not like the face it was drawn for while a second informs you such another is extremely like but he cares not for a piece of deformity tho' its likeness be never so exact  Yet notwithstanding all which happens to the best when I translate I have a desire to be reckon'd amongst them and I shall obtain this if the world will be so goodnatur'd as to believe writers that give their own characters upon which presumption I answer to all objections beforehand as follows  When I am literal I regard my author's words when I am not I translate in his spirit If I am low I chuse the nar∣rative style if high the subject requir'd it When I am e∣nervate I give an instance of ancient simplicity when affec∣ted I show a point of modern delicacy As for beauties there never can be one found in me which was not really intended and for any faults they proceeded from too unbounded fan∣cy or too nice judgment but by no means from any defect in either of those faculties  THE LIFE OF ZOILUS  Pendentem volo Zoilum videre  MARTIAL  THEY who have discours'd concerning the na∣ture and extent of criticism take notice that editions of authors the interpretations of them and the judgment which is pass'd upon each are the three branches into which the art divides itself But the last of these that directs in the choice of books and takes care to prepare us for reading them is by the learned Bacon call'd the Chair of the Critics In this chair to carry on the figure have sate Aristotle De∣metrius Phaleraeus Dionysius Halicarnassensis Ci∣cero Horace Quintilian and Longinus all great names of antiquity the censors of those ages which went before and the directors of those that come after them with respect to the natural and perspicuous man∣ners of thought and a expression by which a correct and  judicious genius may be able to write for the pleasure and profit of mankind  But whatever has been advanc'd by men really great in themselves has been also attempted by others of capacities either unequal to the undertaking or which have been corrupted by their passions and drawn away into partial violences so that we have sometimes seen the province of Criticism usurp'd by such who judge with an obscure diligence and a cer∣tain dryness of understanding incapable of compre∣hending a figurative stile or being mov'd by the beau∣ties of imagination and at other times by such whose natural moroseness in general or particular designs of envy has render'd them indefatigable against the repu∣tation of others  In this last manner is ZOILUS represented to us by antiquity and with a character so abandon'd that his name has been since made use of to brand all succeed∣ing critics of his complexion He has a load of in∣famy thrown upon him great in proportion to the fame of HOMER against whom he oppos'd himself if the one was esteem'd as the very residence of wit the other is describ'd as a profligate who wou'd destroy the temple of Apollo and the Muses in order to have his memory preserv'd by the envious action I imagine it maybe no ungrateful undertaking to write some ac∣count of this celebrated person from whom so many derive their character and I think the life of a Cri∣tic  is not unseasonably put before the works of his Poet especially when his censures accompany him If what he advances be just he stands here as a censor if otherwise he appears as an addition to the poet's fame and is placed before him with the justice of an∣tiquity in its sacrifices when because such a beast had offended such a deity he was brought annually to his altar to be slain upon it  ZOILUS us was born at Amphipolis a city of Thrace during the time in which the Macedonian empire flou∣rish'd Who his parents were is not certainly known but if the appellation of Thracian Slave which the world apply'd to him be not merely an expression of contempt it proves him of mean extraction He was a disciple of one Polycrates a sophist who had distin∣guish'd himself by writing against the great names of the ages before him and who when he is mention'd as his master is said to be particularly famous for a bitter accusation or invective against the memory of Socrates In this manner is ZOILUS set out to poste∣rity like a plant naturally baneful and having its poi∣son render'd more acute and subtle by a preparation  In his person he was tall and meagre his comple∣xion was pale and all the motions of his face were sharp He is represented by Aelian with a beard nou∣rish'd to a prodigious length and his head kept close shav'd to give him a magisterial appearance his coat hung over his knees in a slovenly fashion his man∣ners  were form'd upon an aversion to the customs of the world He was fond of speaking ill diligent to sow dissension and from the constant bent of his thought had obtain'd that sort of readiness for slander or re∣proach which is esteem'd wit by the light opinion of some who take the remarks of illnature for an un∣derstanding of mankind and the abrupt lashes of rude∣ness for the spirit of expression This at last grew to such a height in him that he became careless of con∣cealing it he threw off all reserves and managements in respect of others and the passion so far took the turn of a frenzy that being one day ask'd why he spoke ill of every one  It is says he because I am not able to do them ill tho' I have so great a mind to it  Such extravagant declarations of his general enmity made men deal with him as with the creature he affected to be they no more spoke of him as be∣longing to the species he hated and from henceforth his learned speeches or fine remarks cou'd obtain no other title for him but that of THE RHETORICAL DOG  While he was in Macedon he employ'd his time in writing and reciting what he had written in the schools of sophists His oratory says Dionysius Halicarnas∣sensis was always of the demonstrative kind which concerns itself about praise or dispraise His subjects were the most approv'd authors whom he chose to a∣buse upon the account of their reputation and to  whom without going round the matter in faint praises or artificial insinuations he us'd to deny their own characteristics With this gallantry of opposition did he censure Xenophon for affectation Plato for vulgar notions and Isocrates for incorrectness Demosthe∣nes in his opinion wanted fire Aristotle subtilty and Aristophanes humour But as to have reputation was with him a sufficient cause of enmity so to have that reputation universal was what wrought his frenzy to its wildest degree for which reason it was HOMER with whom he was most implacably angry And cer∣tainly if envy choose its object for the power to give torment it shou'd here if ever have the glory of ful∣ly answering its intentions for the Poet was so wor∣ship'd by the whole age that his Critic had not the common alleviation of the opinion of one other man to concur in his condemnation  ZOILUS however went on with indefatigable indus∣try in a voluminous work which he intitled THE  or CENSURE OF HOMER 'till having at last finish'd it he prepares to send it into the world with a pompous title at the head invented for himself by way of excel∣lency and thus inserted after the manner of the anci∣ents  ZOILUS the scourge of HOMER writ this against that lover of fables  Thus did he value himself upon a work which the world has not thought worth transmitting to us and  but just left a specimen in five or six quotations which happen to be preserv'd by the commentators of that Poet against whom he writ it If any one be fond to form a judgment upon him from these instances they are as follows  IL He says HOMER is very ridiculous a word he was noted to apply to him when he makes such a God as APOLLO employ himself in killing dogs and mules  IL HOMER is very ridiculous in describing DIO∣MEDES' helmet and armour as sparkling and in a blaze of fire about him for then why was he not burn'd by it  IL When IDAEUS quitted his fine chariot which was entangl'd in the fight and for which he might have been slain the Poet was a fool for making him leave his chariot he had better have run away in it  IL When ACHILLES makes PRIAM lie out of his tent lest the Greeks shou'd hear of his being there the Poet had no breeding to turn a king out in that manner  OD The Poet says ULYSSES lost an equal num∣ber out of each ship The Critic says that's impos∣sible  OD He derides the men who were turn'd into swine and calls them HOMER'S poor little blubbering pigs The first five of these remarks are found in DI∣DYMUS the last in LONGINUS  Such as these are the cold jests and trifling quar∣rels which have been registred from a composition that according to the representation handed down to us was born in envy liv'd a short life in contempt and lies for ever bury'd with infamy  But as his design was judg'd by himself wonder∣fully well accomplish'd Macedon began to be esteem'd a stage too narrow for his glory and Egypt which had then taken learning into its patronage the proper place where it ought to diffuse its beams to the sur∣prize of all whom he wou'd persuade to reckon them∣selves hitherto in the dark and under the prejudices of a false admiration However as he had prepar'd himself for the journey he was suddenly diverted for a while by the rumour of the Olympic games which were at that time to be celebrated Thither he steer'd his course full of the memory of Herodotus and o∣thers who had successfully recited in that large assem∣bly and pleas'd to imagine he shou'd alter all Greece in their notions of wit before he left it  Upon his arrival he found the field in its prepara∣tion for diversion The chariots stood for the race carv'd and gilded the horses were led in costly trap∣pings some practis'd to wrestle some to dart the spear or whatever they design'd to engage at in a kind of flourish beforehand others were looking on to amuse themselves and all gaily dress'd according to the cus∣tom of those places Through these did ZOITUS move  forward baldheaded bearded to the middle its a long sadcolour'd vestment and inflexibly stretching forth his hands fill'd with volumes roll'd up to a vast thick∣ness a figure most venerably slovenly able to de∣mand attention upon account of its oddness And in∣deed he had no sooner fix'd himself upon an eminence but a crowd flock'd about him to know what he in∣tended Then the Critic casting his eyes on the ring open'd his volume slowly as considering with what part be might most properly entertain his audience It happen'd that the games at Patroclus' obsequies came first into his thought whether it was that he judg'd it suitable to the place or knew that he had fall'n as well upon the games themselves as upon HOMER for celebrating them and cou'd not resist his natural dispo∣sition to give mankind offence Every one was now intently fasten'd upon him while he undertook to prove that those games signify'd nothing to the taking of Troy and therefore only furnish'd an impertinent Episode that the fall of the lesser Ajax in cowdung the squabble of the chariotrace and other accidents which attend such sports are mean or trifling and a world of other remarks for which he still affirm'd HOMER to be a fool and which they that heard him took for study'd invectives against those exercises they were then employ'd in Men who frequent sports as they are of a chearful dispostion so are they lovers of poetry this together with the opinion they were af∣fronted  wrought them up to impatience and further licences there was particularly a young Athenian gentleman who was to run three chariots in those games who being an admirer of HOMER could no longer contain himself but cry'd out  What in the name of CASTOR have we here ZOILUS from Thrace  and as he said it struck him with a chariotwhip Immediately then a hundred whips were seen curling round his head so that his face natural∣ly deform'd and heighten'd by pain to its utmost Ca∣ricatura appear'd in the midst of them as we may fancy the visage of Envy if at any time her snakes rise in rebellion to lash their mistress Nor was this all the punishment they decreed him when once they imagin'd he was ZOILUS the Scyronian rocks were near 'em and thither they hurried him with a general cry to that speedy justice which is practis'd at places of diversion  It is here that according to SUIDAS the critic ex∣pir'd But we following the more numerous testimo∣nies of other authors conclude he escap'd either by the lowness of those rocks whence he was thrust or by bushes which might break his fall and soon after following the courses of his first intention he set sail for Egypt  Egypt was at this time govern'd by Ptolemy Phi∣ladelphus a prince passionately fond of learning and learned men particularly an admirer of HOMER to  adoration He had built the finest library in the world and made the choicest as well as most numerous col∣lection of books No encouragements were wanting from him to allure men of the brightest genius to his court and no time thought too much which he spent in their company From hence it is that we hear of ERATOSTHENES and ARISTOPHANES those univer∣sal scholars and candid judges of other mens perfor∣mances CALLIMACHUS a poet of the most easy courteous delicacy famous for a poem on the cutting of Berenice's hair and whom OVID so much admired as to say  It was reason enough for him to love a woman if she would but tell him he exceeded CAL∣LIMACHUS  THEOCRITUS the most famous in the pastoral way of writing and among the young men ARISTARCHUS and APOLLONIUS RHODIUS the one of whom prov'd a most judicious critic the other a poet of no mean character  These and many more fill'd the court of that mu∣nificent prince whose liberal dispensations of wealth and favour became encouragements to every one to exert their parts to the utmost like streams which flow through different sorts of soils and improve each in that for which it was adapted by nature  Such was the court when ZOILUS arriv'd but be∣fore he enter'd Alexandria he spent a night in the temple of Isis to enquire of the success of his under∣taking not that he doubted the worth of his works  but his late misfortune had instructed him that others might be ignorant of it Having therefore perform'd the accustom'd sacrifice and compos'd himself to rest upon the hide he had a vision which foretold of his future fame  He found himself sitting under the shade of a dark yew which was cover'd with hellebore and hemlock and near the mouth of a cave where sat a monster pale wasted surrounded with snakes fost'ring a cocka∣trice in her bosom and cursing the sun for making the work of the deities appear in its beauty The sight of this bred fear in him when she subddenly turn∣ing her sunk eyes put on a hideous kind of a loving grin in which he discover'd a resemblance to some of his own features Then turning up her snakes and interlacing them in the form of a turbant to give him less disgust thus she address'd herself  Go on my son in whom I am renew'd and prosper in thy brave undertakings on mankind assert their wit to be dulness prove their sense to be folly know truth only when it is on thy own side and acknow∣ledge learning at no other time to be useful Spare not an author of any rank or size let not thy tongue or pen know pity make the living feel thy accusa∣tions make the ghosts of the dead groan in their tombs for their violated fame But why do I spend time in needless advice which may be better used in encouragement Let thy eyes delight themselves with  the future recompence which I have reserv'd for thy merit  Thus spoke the monster and shriek'd the name of ZOILUS the shades who were to bear the same name after him became obedient and the mouth of the cave was fill'd with strange supercilious counte∣nances which all crowded to make their appearance These began to march before him with an imitation of his mien and manners some crowned with wild sor∣rel others having leaves of dead bays mingled amongst it whilst the monster still describ'd them as he pass'd and touch'd each with a livid track of malignant light that shot from her eye to point where she meant the description  They says she in the chaplets of wild sorrel are my writers of prose who erect scandal into criticism they who wear the wither'd bay with it are such who write poems which are professed∣ly to answer all rules and be left for patterns to men of genius These that follow shall attack others because they are excell'd by them The next rank shall make an author's being read a sufficient ground of opposition Here march my grammarians skill'd to torture words there my sons of sophistry ever ready to wrest a meaning Observe how faint the foremost of the procession appear and how they are now lost in yonder mists which roll about the cave of oblivion this shews it is not for them∣selves that they are to be known the world will consider them only as managing a part of thy en∣dowments  and so know them by thy name while they live that their own shall be lost for ever But see how my cave still swarms how every age pro∣duces men upon whom the preservation of thy me∣mory devolves My darling the fates have decreed it thou art ZOILUS and ZOILUS shall be eternal Come my serpents applaud him with your hisses that is all which now can be done in modern times my sons shall invent louder instruments and artificial imitations noises which drown the voice of merit shall furnish a concert to delight them  Here she arose to clasp him in her arms a strange noise was heard the critic started at it and his vision for∣sook him  It was with some confusion that he lay musing a while upon what he had seen but reflecting that the Goddess had given him no answer concerning his suc∣cess in Egypt he strengthen'd his heart in his ancient selflove and enmity to others and took all for an idle dream born of the fumes of indigestion or produc'd by the dizzy motion of his voyage In this opinion he told it at his departure to the priest who admiring the extraordinary relation registred it in hieroglyphics at Canopus  The day when he came to Alexandria was one on which the king had appointed games to APOLLO and the MUSES and honours and rewards for such writers as shou'd appear in them This he took for a happy  omen at his entrance and not to lose an opportunity of shewing himself repair'd immediately to the public theatre where as if every thing was to favour him the very first accident gave his spleen a diversion which we find at large in the proem of the seventh book of VITRUVIUS It happen'd that when the poets had re∣cited six of the judges decreed the prizes with a full ap∣probation of all the audience From this Aristopha∣nes alone dissented and demanded the first prize for a person whose bashful and interrupted manner of speaking made him appear the most disgustful for he says the judge is alone a poet and all the rest re∣citers and they who are judges shou'd not approve thefts but writings To maintain his assertion those volumes were produc'd from whence they had been stoll'n upon which the king order'd them to be for∣mally try'd for theft and dismiss'd with infamy but placed Aristophanes over his library as one who had given a proof of his knowledge in books This pas∣sage ZOILUS often afterwards repeated with pleasure for the number of disgraces which happen'd in it to the pretenders in poetry tho' his envy made him still careful not to name Aristophanes but a judge in ge∣neral  However criticism had only a short triumph over poetry when he made the next turn his own by step∣ping forward into the place of reciting Here he im∣mediately rais'd the curiosity and drew the attention  of both king and people but as it happen'd neither the one nor the other lasted for the first sentence where he had registred his own name satisfied their cu∣riosity and the next where he offer'd to prove to a court so devoted to HOMER that he was ridiculous in every thing went near to finish his audience He was nevertheless heard quietly for some time till the king seeing no end of his abusing the prince of philological learning as Vitruvius words it departed in disdain The judges follow'd deriding his attempt as an ex∣travagance which cou'd not demand their gravity and the people taking a licence from the precedent hooted him away with obloquy and indignation Thus ZOILUS fail'd at his first appearance and was forc'd to retire stung with a most impatient sense of public contempt  Yet notwithstanding all this he did not omit his attendance at court on the day following with a peti∣tion that he might be put upon the establishment of learning and allow'd a pension This the king read but return'd no answer so great was the scorn he conceiv'd against him But ZOILUS still undauntedly renew'd his petitions 'till PTOLEMY being weary of his persecution gave him a flat denial HOMER says the prince who has been dead these thousand years has maintain'd thousands of people and ZOILUS who boasts he has more wit than he ought not only to maintain himself but many others also  His petitions being thrown carelesly about were fall'n into the hands of men of wit whom according to his custom he had provok'd and whom it is unsafe to provoke if you wou'd live unexpos'd I can com∣pare them to nothing more properly than to the Bee a creature wing'd and lively fond to rove through the choicest flowers of nature and blest at home among the sweets of its own composition not illnatur'd yet quick to revenge an injury not wearing its sting out of the sheath yet able to wound more sorely than its appearance would threaten Now these being made personal enemies by his malicious expressions the court rung with petitions of ZOILUS transvers'd new peti∣tions drawn up for him catalogues of his merits sup∣pos'd to be collected by himself his complaints of man's injustice set to a harp out of tune and a hundred other sports of fancy with which their epigrams play'd upon him These were the ways of writing which ZOILUS hated because they were not only read but retain'd easily by reason of their spirit humour and brevity and because they not only make the man a jest upon whom they are written but a farther jest if he attempt to answer them gravely However he did what he cou'd in revenge he endeavour'd to set those whom he envy'd at variance among themselves and invented lyes to promote his design He told Eratos∣thenes that Callimachus said his extent of learning consisted but in a superficial knowledge of the sciences  and whisper'd Callimachus that Eratosthenes only al∣low'd him to have an artful habitual knack of versify∣ing He would have made Aristophanes believe that Theocritus rally'd his knowledge in editions as a cu∣rious kind of trifling and Theocritus that Aristo∣phanes derided the rustical simplicity of his shepherds Tho' of all his stories that which be most valu'd him∣self for was his constant report that every one whom he hated was a friend to ANTIOCHUS king of Syria the enemy of PTOLEMY  But malice is unsuccessful when the character of its agent is known they grew more friends to one ano∣ther by imagining that even what had been said as well as what had not was all of ZOILUS'S invention and as he grew more and more the common jest their derision of him became a kind of life and cement to their conversation  Contempt poverty and other misfortunes had now so assaulted him that even they who abhorr'd his tem∣per contributed something to his support in common humanity Yet still his envy like a vitiated stomach converted every kindness to the nourishment of his dis∣ease and 'twas the whole business of his life to revile HOMER and those by whom he himself subsisted In this humour he had days which were so given up to impatient illnature that he could neither write any thing nor converse with anyone These he sometimes employ'd in throwing stones at children which was  once so unhappily return'd upon him that he was ta∣ken up for dead and this occasion'd the report in some authors of his being stoned to death in Egypt Or sometimes he convey'd himself into the library where he blotted the name of HOMER wherever he could meet it and tore the best editions of several volumes for which the librarians debarr'd him the privilege of that place These and other mischiefs made him universal∣ly shunn'd nay to such an extravagance was his cha∣racter of envy carry'd that the more superstitious E∣gyptians imagin'd they were fascinated by him if the day were darker or themselves a little heavier than ordinary some wore sprigs of rue by way of preven∣tion and others rings made of the hoof of a wild ass for amulets lest they should suffer by his fixing an eye upon them  It was now near the time when that splendid temple which PTOLEMY built in honour of HOMER was to be open'd with a solemn magnificence for this the men of genius were employ'd in finding a proper pageant At last they agreed by one consent to have ZOILUS the utter enemy of HOMER hang'd in effigy and the day being come it was on this manner they form'd the procession Twelve beautiful boys lightly habited in white with purple wings representing the HOURS went on the foremost after these came a chariot ex∣ceeding high and stately where sat one representing APOLLO with another at his feet who in thig pomp  sustain'd the person of HOMER Apollo's laurel had little gilded points like the appearance of rays between its leaves HOMER's was bound with a blue sillet like that which is worn by the priests of the Deity Apollo was distinguish'd by the golden harp he bore Homer by a volume richly beautify'd with horns of inlaid ivo∣ry and tassels of silver depending from them Behind these came three chariots in which rode nine damsels each of them with that instrument which is proper to each of the Muses among whom CALLIOPE to give her the honour of the day sate in the middle of the second chariot known by her richer vestments Af∣ter these march'd a solemn train aptly habited like those sciences which acknowledge their rise or improve∣ment from this Poet Then the men of learning who attended the court with wreaths and rods or scepters of laurel as taking upon themselves the representation of Rhapsodists to do honour for the time to HOMER In the rear of all was slowly drawn along an odd car∣riage rather than a chariot which had its sides art∣fully turn'd and carv'd so as to bear a resemblance to the heads of snarling mastiffs In this was borne as led in triumph a tall image of deformity whose head was bald and wound about with nettles for a chaplet The tongue lay lolling out to shew a contempt of man∣kind and was fork'd at the end to confess its love to detraction The hands were manacled behind and the fingers arm'd with long nails to cut deep through  the margins of authors Its vesture was of the paper of Nilus bearing inscrib'd upon its breast in capital letters ZOILUS THE HOMEROMASTIX and all the rest of it was scrawl'd with various monsters of that river as emblems of those productions with which that critic us'd to fill his papers When they had reach'd the temple where the king and his court were already plac'd to behold them from its galleries the image of ZOILUS was hung upon a gibbet there erected for it with such loud acclamations as witness'd the people's satisfaction This being finish'd the HOURS knock'd at the gates which flew open and discover'd the statue of HOMER magnificently seated with the pictures of those cities which contended for his birth rang'd in order around him Then they who represented the Deities in the procession laying aside their ensigns of divinity usher'd in the men of learning with a sound of voices and their various instruments to assist at a sacrifice in honour of APOLLO and his favourite HOMER  It may be easily believ'd that ZOILUS concluded his affairs were at the utmost point of desperation in Egypt wherefore fill'd with pride scorn anger vexa∣tion envy and whatever cou'd torment him except the knowledge of his unworthiness he flung himself a∣board the first ship which left that country As it hap∣pen'd the vessel he sail'd in was bound for Asia Minor and this landing him at a port the nearest to Smyrna he was à little pleas'd amidst his misery to think of de∣crying  HOMER in another place where he was ador'd and which chiefly pretended to his birth So incorri∣gible was his disposition that no experience taught him anything which might contribute to his ease and safety  And as his experience wrought nothing on him so neither did the accidents which the opinion of those times took for ominous warnings for he is reported to have seen the night he came to Smyrna a venerable person such as HOMER is described by antiquity threatning him in a dream and in the morning he found a part of his works gnaw'd by Mice which says Aelian are of all beasts the most prophetic insomuch that they know when to leave a house even before its fall is suspected Envy which has no relaxation still hurry'd him forward for it is certainly true that a man has not firmer resolution from reason to stand by a good principle than obstinacy from perverted nature to adhere to a bad one  In the morning as he walk'd the street he observ'd in some plates inscriptions concerning HOMER which inform'd him where he liv'd where he had taught school and several other particularities which the Smyr∣neans glory to have recorded of him all which awa∣ken'd and irritated the passions of ZOILUS But hit temper was quite overthrown by the venerable ap∣pearance which he saw upon entring the Homereum which is a building compos'd of a library porch and temple erected to HOMER Here a phrenzy seited him  which knew no bounds he rav'd violently against the Poet and all his admirers he trampled on his works he spurn'd about his commentators he tore down his busts from the niches threw the medals that were cast of him out of the windows and passing from one place to another beat the aged priests and broke down the altar The cries which were occasioned by this means brought in many upon him who observ'd with horror how the most sacred honours of their city were pro∣phan'd by the frantic impiety of a stranger and im∣mediately dragg'd him to punishment before their ma∣gistrates who were then sitting He was no sooner there but known for ZOILUS by some in court a name a long time most hateful to Smyrna which as it valu'd itself upon the birth of HOMER so bore more impatiently than other places the abuses offer'd him This made them eager to propitiate his shade and claim to themselves a second merit by the death of ZOILUS wherefore they sentenc'd him to suller by fire as the due reward of his desecrations and order'd that their city shou'd be purify'd by a lustration for having entertain'd so impious a guest In pursuance to this sentence he was led away with his composi∣tions born before him by the public executioner then was he fasten'd to the stake prophesying all the while how many shou'd arise to revenge his quarrel parti∣cularly that when Greek shou'd be no more a lan∣guage there shall be a Nation which will both trans∣late  HOMER into Prose and contract him in Verse At last his compositions were lighted to set the pile on fire and he expir'd sighing for the loss of them more than for the pain he suffer'd and perhaps too be∣cause he might foresee in his prophetic rapture that there shou'd arise a poet in another nation able to do HOMER justice and make him known amongst his people to future ages  Thus dy'd this noted critic of whom we may ob∣serve from the course of the history that as several ci∣ties contended for the honour of the birth of HOMER so several have contended for the honour of the death of ZOILUS With him likewise perish'd his great work on the ILIAD and the ODYSSE concerning which we observe also that as the known worth of HOMER'S poetry makes him survive himself with glory so the bare memory of ZOILUS'S criticism makes him sur∣vive himself with infamy These are deservedly the consequences of that Illnature which made him fond of detraction that Envy which made him choose so excellent a character for its object and those partial Methods of Injustice with which he treated the object he had chosen  Yet how many commence critics after him upon the same unhappy principles How many labour to destroy the monuments of the dead and summon up the great from their graves to answer for trifles before them how many by misrepresentations both hinder the world  from favouring men of genius and discourage them in themselves like boughs of a baneful and barren nature that shoot across a fruittree at once to screen the sun from it and hinder it by their droppings from producing any thing of value but if these who thus follow ZOILUS meet not the same severities of fate because they come short of his indefatigableness or their object is not so universally the concern of man∣kind they shall nevertheless meet a proportion of it in the inward trouble they give themselves and the outward contempt others fling upon them a punish∣ment which every one has hitherto felt who has real∣ly deserv'd to be call'd a ZOILUS and which will al∣ways be the natural reward of such mens actions as long as ZOILUS is the proper name of Envy  ZOILUS's REMARKS  Ingenium magni livor detrectat amici  Quisquis et ex illo Zoile nomen habes  I MUST do my Reader the justice before I enter upon these NOTES of ZOILUS to inform him that I have not in any author met this work ascrib'd to him by its title which has made me not mention it in the LIFE But thus much in general appears that he wrote several things besides his censure on the ILIAD which as it gives ground for this opinion encourages me to offer an account of the Treatise  Being acquainted with a grave gentleman who searches after Editions purchases Manuscripts and collects Copies I apply'd to him for some Editions of this Poem which he readily oblig'd me with But ad∣ded he taking down a paper I doubt I shall discou∣rage you from your translation when I show this work which is written upon the original by ZOILUS the famous adversary of HOMER ZOILUS said I with  surprize I thought his works had long since perish'd They have so answer'd he all except this little Piece which has a PREFACE annex'd to it accounting for its preservation It seems when he parted from Macedon he left this behind him where he lodg'd and where no one enter'd for a long time in detestation of the odi∣ousness of his character 'till Maevius arriving there in his travels and being desirous to lie in the same room luckily found it and brought it away with him This the author of the PREFACE imagines the reason of Ho∣race's wishing Maevius in the th EPODE such a shipwreck as HOMER describes as it were with an eye to his having done something disadvantageous to that Poet From Maevius the piece came into the hand of Carbilius Pictor who when he wrote against Virgil call'd his book with a respectful imitation of ZOILUS the AENEIDOMASTIX and from him into the hands of others who are unknown because the world apply'd to them no other name than that of ZOILUS in order to sink their own in oblivion Thus it ever found some learned philologist or critic to keep it secret from the rage of HOMER's admirers yet not so secret but that it has still been communicated among the LITERATI I am of opinion that our great SCALIGER borrow'd it to work him up when he writ so sharply against Cardan and perhaps Le Clerc too when he prov'd Q Curtius ignorant of every particular branch of learning  This formal account made me give attention to what the book contain'd and I must acknowledge that whether it be his or the work of some gramma∣rian it appears to be writ in his spirit The open pro∣fession of enmity to great genius's and the fear of no∣thing so much as that he may not be able to find faults enough are such resemblances of his strongest features that any one might take it for his own production To give the world a notion of this I have made a collection of some REMARKS which most struck me during that short time in which I was allow'd to per∣use the Manuscript  THE REMARKS OF ZOILUS UPON HOMER'S BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE  Pag Ver  TO FILL MY RISING SONG  As Protagoras the sophist found fault with the beginning of the ILIAD for its speaking to the Muse rather with an abrupt command than a solemn invocation so I says ZOILUs doon the other hand find fault with him for using any invocation at all before this poem or any such trifles as he is the author of If he must use one Protagoras is in the right if not I am this I hold for true criticism notwithstanding the opinion of Aristotle against us Nor let any one lay  a stress on Aristotle in this point he alas knows nothing of Poetry but what he has read in HOMER his rules are all extracted from him or founded in him In short HOMER'S works are the examples of Aristotle's precepts and Aristotle's precepts the methods HOMER wrought by  From hence it is to be concluded as the opinion of this Critic that who∣ever wou'd entirely destroy the reputation of HOMER must renounce the authority of Aristotle beforehand The rules of building may be of service to us if we design to judge of an edifice and discover what may be amiss in it for the advantage of future artificers but they are of no use to those who only intend to o∣verthrow it utterly  After the word SONG in the first line the ori∣ginal adds WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN MY TA∣BLETS These words which are dropp'd in the trans∣lation as of no consequence the great ZOILUS has thought fit to expunge asserting for a reason with∣out backing it with farther proof  That tablets were it not of fo early invention  Now it must be grant∣ed this manner of proving by affirmation is of an ex∣traordinary nature but however it has its end with a set of readers for whom it is adapted One part of the world knows not with what assurance another part can express itself They imagine a reasonable creature will not have the face to say any thing which has not some shadow of reason to support it and run impli∣citly  into the snare which is laid for goodnature by these daring authors of definitive sentences upon bare assertion  Pag Ver WHOM CATS PURSU'D The Greek word here expresly signifies a Cat ZOILUS whom Perizonius follows affirms  It was Weezels which the Mouse fled from  and then objects a∣gainst its probability But it is common with one sort of Critics to shew an author means differently from what he really did and then to prove that the mean∣ing which they find out for him is good for nothing  Pag Ver IF WORTHY FRIENDSHIP In this proposal begins the moral of the whole piece which is that hasty illfounded or unnatural friend∣ships and leagues will naturally end in war and dis∣cord But ZOILUS who is here mightily concern'd to take off from HOMER all the honour of having design'd a moral asserts on the other hand  That the Poet's whole intent was to make a Fable that a Fable he has made and one very idle and trifling that many things are ascrib'd to HOMER which poor HOMER never dream'd of and he who finds them out ra∣ther shews his own parts than discovers his author's beauties  In this opinion has he been follow'd by several of those Critics who only dip into authors when they have occasion to write against them and yet even these shall speak differently concerning the writers if the question be of their own performances  for to their own works they write Prefaces to dis∣play the grandness of the moral regularity of the scheme number and brightness of the figures and a thousand other excellencies which if they did not tell no one wou'd ever imagine For others they write Remarks which tend to contract their excellencies within the narrow compass of their partial appre∣hesion It were well if they cou'd allow such to be as wise as themselves whom the world allows to be much wiser but their being naturally friends to themselves and professedly adversaries to some greater genius easily accounts for these different man∣ners of speaking I will not leave this note without giving you an instance of its practice in the great JU∣LIUS SCALIGER he has been free enough with HO∣MER in the Remarks he makes upon him but when he speaks of himself I desire my reader wou'd take no∣tice of his modesty I give his own words Lib Poet Cap  In Deum Patrem Hymnum cum scriberemus tanquam rerum omnium conditorem ab orbis ipsius creatione ad nos nostraque usque duxi∣mus In quo abduximus animum nostrum a cor∣poris carcere ad liberos campos contemplationis quae me in illum transformaret Tum autem sanc∣tissimi Spiritus ineffabilis vigor ille canto ardore ce∣lebratus est ut cum lenissimis numeris esset inchoa∣tus Hymnus repentino divini Ignis impetu consla∣gravit  Pag Ver THE CIRCLED LOAVES  ZOI∣LUS here finds fault with the mention of loaves tripes bacon and cheese as words below the dig∣nity of the EPIC as much says he as it wou'd be to have opprobrious names given in it  By which expression we easily see he hints at the first book of the ILIAD Now we must consider in answer that it is a Mouse which is spoken of that eating is the most appearing chatacteristic of that creature that these foods are such as please it most and to have de∣scrib'd particular pleasures for it in any other way wou'd have been as incongruous as to have describ'd a haughty loud anger without those names which it throws out in its fierceness and which raise it to its pitch of phrenzy In the one instance you still see a Mouse before you however the Poet raises it to a man in the other you shall see a man before you however the Poet raises him to a DemiGod But some call that LOW which others call NATURAL Every thing has two handles and the critic who sets himself to cen∣sure all he meets is under an obligation still to lay hold on the worst of them  Pag Ver BUT ME NOR STALKS In this place ZOILUS  laughs at the ridiculousness of the Poet who according to his representation makes a prince refuse an invitation in heroics because he did not like the meat he was invited to  And that the ridicule may appear in as strong a light to others  as to himself he puts as much of the speech as con∣cerns it into burlesque airs and expressions This is indeed a common trick with Remarkers which they either practise by precedent from their master ZOILUS or are beholden for it to the same turn of temper We acknowledge it a fine piece of satire when there is folly in a passage to lay it open in the way by which it naturally requires to be expos'd do this hand∣somely and the author is deservedly a jest  on the contrary you dress a passage which was not original∣ly foolish in the highest humour of ridicule you only frame something which the author himself might laugh at without being more nearly concerned than another render  Pag Ver SO PASS'D EUROPA This si∣mile makes ZOILUS who sets up for a profess'd enemy of Fables to exclaim violently  We had says he a Frog and a Mouse hitherto and now we get a Bull and a Princess to illustrate their actions when will there be an end of this Fablingfolly and Poetry which I value myself for being unacquainted with O great POLYCRATES how happily hast thou ob∣servd in thy accusation against SOCRATES That whatever he was before he deserv'd his poison when he began to make verses  Now if the question be concerning HOMER'S good or bad Poetry this is an unqualifying speech which affords his friends just grounds of exception against the Critic Wherefore  be it known to all present and future Cenfors who haver or shall presume to glory in an ignorance of Poetry and at the same time take upon them to judge of Poets that they are in all their degrees for evere ex∣cluded the post they would usurp In the first place they who know neither the use nor practice of the art in the second they who know it but by halves Who have hearts insensible of the beauties of Poetry and are however able to find fault by rules and thirdly they who when they are capable of perceiv∣ing beauties and pointing out defects are still so igno∣rant in the nature of their business as to imagine the province of Criticism extends itself only on the side of dispraise and reprehension How cou'd any one at this rate be seen with his proper balance of perfection and error or what were the best performances in this in∣dulgence of illnature but as apartments hung with the deformities of humanity done by some great hand which are the more to be abhorr'd because the praise and honour they receive results from the degree of uneasiness to which they put every temper of com∣mon goodness  Pag Ver YE MICE YE MICE The an∣cients believ'd that heroes were turn'd into DemiGods at their death and in general that departing fouls have something of a sight into futurity It is ei∣ther this notion or a care which the Gods may take to abate the pride of insulting adversaries which a  Poet goes upon when he makes his leaders die fore∣telling the end of those by whom they are slain ZOI∣LUS however is against this passage He says  That every character ought to be strictly kept that a ge∣neral ought not to invade the character of a prophet nor a prophet of a general  He is positive  that nothing shou'd be done by any one without having been hinted at in some previous account of him  And this he asserts without any allowance made either for a change of states or the design of the Gods To confirm this observation he strengthens it with a quo∣tation out of his larger work on the ILIAD where he has these words upon the death of HECTOR  How foolish is it in HOMER to make HECTOR who thro' the whole course of the ILIAD had made use of HE∣LENUS to learn the will of the Gods becomes pro∣phet just at his death Let every one be what he ought without falling into those parts which others are to sustain in a poem  This he has said not di∣stinguishing rightly between our natural dispostions and accidental offices And this he has said again not minding that tho' it be taken from another book it is still from the same author However vanity loves to gratify itself by the repetition of what it esteems to be written with spirit and even when we repeat it our∣selves provided another hears us Hence has he been follow'd by a magisterial set of men who quote them∣selves and swell their new perfomances with what  they admire in their former Treatises This is a most extraordinary knack of arguing whereby a man can never want a proof if he be allow'd to become an au∣thority for his own opinion  Pag Ver AND NO KIND BILLOW  How impertinent is this case of pity says ZOILUS to be∣moan that the prince was not toss'd towards land It is enough he lost his life and there is an end of his suffering where there is an end of his feeling To carry the matter farther is just the same foolish management as HOMER has shewn in his ILIADS which he spins out into forty trifles beyond the death of HECTOR  But the Critic must allow me to put the renders in mind that death was not the last distress the Ancients believ'd was to be met upon earth The last was the remaining unbury'd which had this misery an∣nex'd that while the body was without its funeralrites in this world the soul was suppos'd to be without rest in the next which was the case of the Mouse be∣fore us And accordingly the AJAX of SOPHOCLES continues after the death of its hero more than an act upon the contest concerning his burial All this ZOI∣LUS knew very well but ZOILUS is not the only one who disputes for victory rather than truth These foolish to shew how much they can write against an author They act unfairly that they may be sure to be sharp enough and trifle with the reader in order  to be voluminous It is needless to wish them the re∣turn they deserve their disregard to candour is no sooner discover'd but they are for ever banish'd from the eyes of men of sense and condemn'd to wander from stall to stall for a temporary refuge from that oblivion which they can't escape  Pag Ver OUR ELDEST PERISH'D ZOI∣LUS had here taken  the recapitulation of those mis∣fortunes which happen'd to the Royal Family as an impertinence that expatiates from the subject  tho' indeed there seems nothing more proper to raise that sort of compassion which was to inslame his audience to war But what appears extremely pleasant is that at the same time he condemns the passage he shou'd make use of it as an opportunity to fall into  an ample digression on the various kinds of Mouse∣traps  and display that minute learning which e∣very Critic of his sort is fond to shew himself master of This they imagine is tracing of knowledge thro' its hidden veins and bringing discoveries to day∣light which time had cover'd over Indefatigable and useless mortals who value themselves for knowledge of no consequence and think of gaining applause by what the reader is careful to pass over unread What did the disquisition signify formerly whether Ulysses's Son or his Dog was the elder or how can the ac∣count of a Vesture or a Player's Masque deserve that any shou'd write the bulk of a treatise or others read  it when it is written A vanity thus poorly support∣ed which neither affords pleasure nor profit is the un∣substantial amusement of a dream to ourselves and a provoking occasion of our derision to others  Pag Ver QUILLS APTLY BOUNDFAC'D WITH THE PLUNDER OF A CAT THEY FLAY'D This passage is something difficult in the original which gave ZOILUS the opportunity of inventing an expression which his followers conceitedly use when any thing appears dark to them  This say they let Phoebus explain  as if what exceeds their capa∣city must of necessity demand oracular interpretations and an interposal of the God of Wit and Learning The basis of such arrogance is the opinion they have of that knowledge they ascribe to themselves They take Criticism to be beyond every other part of learn∣ing because it gives judgment upon books written in every other part They think in consequence that every Critic must be a greater Genius than any Au∣thor whom he censures and therefore if they esteem themselves Critics they set enthron'd Infancy at the head of Literature Criticism indeed deserves a noble Elogy when it is enlarg'd by such a comprehensive learning as Aristotle and Cicero were masters of when it adorns its precepts with the consummate exactness of Quintilian or is exalted into the sublime sentiments of Longinus But let not such men tell us they parti∣cipate in the glory of these great men and place them∣selves  next to PHOEBUS who like ZOILUS entangle an author in the wrangles of grammarians or try him with a positive air and barren imagination by the set of rules they have collected out of others  Pag Ver YE FROGS THE MICE At this speech of the Herald's which recites the cause of the war ZOILUS is angry with the Author  for not finding out a cause entirely just for says he it appears not from his own Fable that Physignathus invited the prince with any malicious intention to make him away  To this we answer st That it is not necessary in relating facts to make every war have a just beginning dly This doubtful cause a∣grees better with the moral by shewing that illfound∣ed leagues have accidents to destroy them even with∣out the intention of parties dly There was all ap∣pearance imaginable against the frogs and if we may be allow'd to retort on our adversary the practice of his posterity there is more humanity in an hostility pro∣claim'd upon the appearance of injustice done us than in their custom of attacking the works of others as soon as they come out purely because they are esteem'd to be good Their performances which cou'd derive no merit from their own names are then sold upon the merit of their antagonist and if they are so sen∣sible of fame or even of envy they have the morti∣fication to remember how much by this means they be∣come indebted to those they injure  Pag Ver WHERE HIGH THE BANKS This project is not put in practice during the follow∣ing battle by reason of the fury of the combatants yet the mention of it is not impertinent in this place forasmuch as the probable face of success which it car∣ties with it tended to animate the Frogs ZOILUS however cannot be so satisfied  It were better says he to cut it intirely out nor won'd HOMER be the worse if half of him were serv'd in the same man∣ner so continues he they will find it whoever in any country shall hereafter undertake so odd a task as that of translating him  Thus Envy finds words to put in the mouth of Ignorance and the time will come when Ignorance shall repeat what Envy has pronounced so rashly  Pag Ver AND TAP'RING SEAREEDS If we here take the reed for that of our own growth it is no spear to match the long sort of needles with which the Mice had arm'd themselves but the cane which is rather intended has its splinters stiff and sharp to answer all the uses of a spear in battle Nor is it here to be lightly past over since ZOILUS moves a question upon it that the Poet cou'd not choose a more proper weapon for the Frogs than that which they choose for themselves in a defensive war they maintain with the serpents of Nile  They have this stratagem says Aelian to protect themselves they swim with pieces of cane across their mouths of too great a length  for the breadth of the serpents throats by which means they are preserv'd from being swallow'd by them  This is a quotation so much to the point that I ought to have usher'd in my Author with more pomp to dazzle the reader ZOILUS and his follow∣ers who seldom praise any man are however careful to do it for their own sakes if at any time they get an author of their opinion tho' indeed it must be al∣low'd they still have a drawback in their manner of praise and rather choose to drop the name of their man or darkly hint him in a periphrasis than to have it ap∣pear that they have directly assisted the perpetuating of any one's memory Thus if a Dutch Critic were to introduce for example MARTIAL he would instead of naming him say INGENIOSUS ILLE EPIGRAMMATI∣CUS BILBILICUS Or if one of our own were to quote from among ourselves he wou'd tell us how it has been remark'd  in the works of a learned Writer to whom the world is obliged for many excellent productions  etc All which proceeding is like boasting of our great friends when it is to do ourselves an honour or the shift of dressing up one who might otherwise be disregarded to make him pass upon the world for a responsible voucher to our own assertions  Pag Ver BUT NOW WHERE JOVE'S At this fine Episode in which the Gods are introduced ZOILUS has no patience left him to remark but runs some lines with a long string of such expressions as  "Trifler Fabler Lyar foolish impious" all which he lavishly heaps upon the Poet From this knack of calling names join'd with the several arts of finding fault it is to be suspected that our ZOILUS'S might make very able libellers and dangerous men to the government if they did not rather turn themselves to be ridiculous censors for which reason I cannot but reckon the state oblig'd to men of wit and under a kind of debt in gratitude when they take off so much spleen turbulency and illnature as might otherwise spend itself to the detriment of the public  Pag Ver IF MY DAUGHTER'S MIND This speech which Jupiter speaks to Pallas with a pleasant kind of air ZOILUS takes gravely to pieces and affirms  It is below Jupiter's wisdom and on∣ly agreeable with HOMER'S folly that he shou'd bor∣row a reason for her assisting the Mice from their at∣tendance in the temple when they waited to prey upon those things which were sacred to her  But the air of the speech rendering a grave answer unne∣cessary I shall only offer ZOILUS an observation in return for his There are upon the stone which is carv'd for the apotheosis of HOMER figures of Mice by his footstool which according to Cuperus its interpre∣ter some have taken to signify this Poem and others those Critics who tear or vilify the works of great men Now if such can be compar'd to Mice let the words of ZOILUS be brought home to himself and his fol∣lowers  for their mortification  That no one ought to think of meriting in the state of learning only by de∣basing the best performances and as it were prey∣ing upon those things which shou'd be sacred in it  Pag Ver IN VAIN MY FATHER The speech of Pallas is dislik'd by ZOILUS  because it makes the Goddess carry a resentment against such inconsiderable creatures  tho' he ought to esteem them otherwise when they represent the persons and actions of men and teach us how the Gods disregard those in their adversities who provoke them in prospe∣rity But if we consider Pallas as the patroness of learn∣ing we may by an allegorical application of the Mice and Frogs find in this speech two sorts of enemies to learning they who are maliciously mischievous as the Mice and they who are turbulent through ostentation as the Frogs The first are enemies to excellency up∣on principle the second accidentally by the error of selflove which does not quarrel with the excellence itself but only with those people who get more praise than themselves by it Thus tho' they have not the same perverseness with the others they are however drawn into the same practices while they ruin reputa∣tions lest they shou'd not seem to be learn'd as some women turn prostitutes lest they shou'd not be thought handsome enough to have admirers  Pag Ver THEIR DREADFUL TRUMPETS Upon the reading of this ZOILUS becomes full of dis∣coveries  He recollects  that Homer makes his Greeks come to battle with silence and his Trojans with shouts  from whence he discovers  that he knew nothing of trumpets  Again he sees  that the hornet is made a trumpeter to the battle  and hence he discovers  that the line must not be HO∣MER'S  Now had he drawn his consequences fair∣ly he cou'd only have found by the one that trum∣pets were not in use at the taking of Troy and by the other that the battle of Frogs and Mice was laid by the Poet for a later scene of action than that of the ILIAD But the boast of discoveries accompanies the affectation of knowledge and the affectation of know∣ledge is taken up with a design to gain a command o∣ver the opinions of others It is too heavy a task for some Critics to sway our rational judgments by ratio∣nal inferences a pompous pretence must occasion ad∣miration the eyes of mankind must be obscur'd by a glare of pedantry that they may consent to be led blind∣fold and permit that an opinion shou'd be dictated to them without demanding that they may be reason'd into it  Pag Ver BIG SEUTLAEUS TUMBLING ZOILUS has happen'd to brush the dust of some old manuscript in which the line that kills SEUTLAEUS is wanting And for this cause he fixes a general conclu∣sion  that there is no dependance upon any thing which is handed down for HOMER'S so as to allow it  praise since the different copies vary amongst them∣selves  But is it fair in ZOILUS or any of his fol∣lowers to oppose one copy to a thousand and are they impartial who wou'd pass this upon us for an ho∣nest balance of evidence When there is such an in∣equality on each side is it not more than probable that the number carry the author's sense in them and the single one its transcriber's errors It is folly or mad∣ness of passion to be thus given over to partiality and prejudices Men may flourish as much as they please concerning the value of a newfound edition in or∣der to byass the world to particular parts of it but in a matter easily decided by common sense it will still continue of its own opinion  Pag Ver WITH BORBOCAETES FIGHTS Through the grammatical part of ZOILUS'S work he frequently rails at HOMER for his dialects "These" says he in one place  the Poet made use of because he could not write pure Greek  and in another  they strangely contributed to his fame by making se∣veral cities who observ'd something of their own in his mix'd language contend for his being one of their natives  Now since I have here practis'd a licence in imitation of his by shortning the word BORBO∣CAETES a whole syllable it seems a good opportunity to speak for him where I defend myself Remember then that any great genius who introduces Poetry into a language has a power to polish it and of all the  manners of speaking then in use to settle that for Poe∣tical which he judges most adapted to the art Take notice too that HOMER has not only done this for ne∣cessity but for ornament since he uses various dialects to humour his sense with sounds which are expressive of it Thus much in behalf of my Author to answer ZOILUS as for myself who deal with his followers I must argue from necessity that the word was stub∣born and wou'd not ply to the quantities of an English Verse and therefore I alter'd it by the Dialect we call Poetical which makes my line so much smoother that I am ready to cry with their brother LIPSIUS when he turn'd an O into an I  Vel ego me amo vel me amavit Phoebus quando hoc correxi  To this let me add a recrimination upon some of them As st such as choose words written after the manner of those who preceded the purest age of a language without the necessity I have pleaded as  regundi for regendi per∣duit for perdidit  which restoration of obsolete words deserves to be call'd a Critical Licence or Dia∣lect dly Those who pretending to verse without an ear use the Poetical Dialect of Abbreviation so that the lines shall run the rougher for it And dly those who presume by their Critical Licences to alter the spellings of words an affectation which destroys the etymology of a language and being carry'd on by pri∣vate hands for fancy or fashion wou'd be a thing we shou'd never have an end  Pag Ver NOR PALLAS JOVE  I can∣not says ZOILUS reflect upon this speech of Mars is where a Mouse is oppos'd to the God of War the Goddess of Valour the thunder of Jupiter and all the Gods at once but I rejoice to think that PY∣THAGORAS saw HOMER'S soul in hell hanging on a tree and surrounded with serpents for what he said of the Gods  Thus he who hates Fables answers one with another and can rejoice in them when they flatter his envy He appears at the head of his squadron of Critics in the full spirit of one utterly devoted to a party with whom truth is a lye or as bad as a lye when it makes against him and false quotations pass for truth or as good as truth when they are necessary to a cause  Pag Ver AND A WHOLE WAR  Here says ZOILUS is an end of a very foolish Poem of which by this time I have effectually convinc'd the world and silenc'd all such for the future who like HOMER write Fables to which others find Morals characters whose justness is question'd unnecessary digressions and impious episodes  But what assu∣rance can such a ZOILUS have that the world will e∣ver be convinc'd against an establish'd reputation by such people whose faults in writing are so very noto∣rious who judge against rules affirm without reasons and censure without manners who quote themselves for a support of their opinions found their pride up∣on  a learning in trifles and their superiority upon the claims they magisterially make who write of beauties in a harsh style judge of excellency with a lowness of spirit and pursue their desire to decry it with every ar∣tifice of envy There is no disgrace in being censur'd where there is no credit to be favour'd But on the contrary Envy gives a testimony of some perfection in another and one who is attack'd by many is like a hero whom his enemies acknowledge for such when they point all the spears of a battle against him In short an author who writes for every age may even erect himself a monument of those stones which Envy throws at him while the Critic who writes against him can have no fame because he had no success or if he fancies he may succeed he shou'd remember that by the nature of his undertaking he wou'd but undermine his own foundation for he is to sink of course when the book which he writes against and for which alone he is read is lost in disrepute or oblivion  THE END OF MR PARNELL'S WORKS AS

OR THE VINES OF LESBOS  AS Bacchus ranging at his leisure  lo Bacchus king of pleasure  Charm'd the wide world with drink and dances  And all his thousand airy fancies  Alas he quite forgot the while  His fav'rite vines in Lesbos isle  The God returning ere they died  Ah see my jolly Fawns he cried  The leaves but hardly born are red  And the bare arms for pity spread  The beasts afford a rich manure  Fly my boys and bring the lure  Up the mountains down the vales  Thro' the woods and o'er the dales  For this if full the clusters grow  Your bowls shall doubly overflow  So chear'd with more officious haste  They bring the dung of ev'ry beast  The loads they wheel the roots they bare  They lay the rich manure with care  While oft he calls to labour hard  And names as oft the red reward  The plants revive new leaves appear  The thick'ning clusters load the year  The season swiftly purple grew  The grapes hung dangling deep with blue  A vineyard ripe a day serene  Now calls them all to work again  The Fawns thro' ev'ry furrow shoot  To load their flaskets with the fruit  And now the vintage early trod  The wines invite the jovial God  Strow the roses raise the song  See the master comes along  Lusty Revel join'd with Laughter  Whim and Frolic follow after  The Fawns beside the vatts remain  To shew the work and reap the gain  All around and all around  They sit to riot on the ground  A vessel stands amidst the ring  And here they laugh and there they sing  Or rise a jolly jolly band  And dance about it hand in hand  Dance about and shout amain  Then sit to laugh and sing again  But as an antient author sung  The vine manur'd with ev'ry dung  From ev'ry creature strangely drew  A tang of brutal nature too  'Twas hence in drinking on the lawns  New turns of humour seiz'd the Fawns  Here one was crying out by Jove  Another fight me in the grove  This wounds a friend and that the trees  The Lion's temper reign'd in these  Another grins and leaps about  And keeps a merry world of rout  And talks impertinently free  And twenty talk the same as he  Chatt'ring airy idle kind  These take the Monkeyturn of mind  Here one who saw the nymphs that stood  To peep upon them from the wood  Steals off to try if any maid  Be lagging late beneath the shade  While loose discourse another raises  In naked Nature's plainest phrases  And ev'ry glass he drinks enjoys  With change of nonsense lust and noise  Mad and careless hot and vain  Such as these the Goat retain  Another drinks and casts it up  And drinks and wants another cup  Solemn silent and sedate  Ever long and ever late  Full of meats and full of wine  This takes his temper from the swine  Here some who hardly seem to breathe  Drink and hang the jaw beneath  Gaping tender apt to weep  Their natures alter'd by the sheep  'Twas thus one autumn all the crew  If what the Poets sing be true  While Bacchus made the merry feast  Inclin'd to one or other beast  And since 'tis said for many a mile  He spread the vines of Lesbos isle  ELYSIUM  IN airy fields the fields of bliss below  Where woods of myrtle set by Maro grow  Where grass beneath and shade diffus'd above  Refresh the fever of distracted love  There at a solemn tide the beauties slain  By tender passion act their fates again  Thro' gloomy light that just betrays the grove  In Orgyes all disconsolately rove  They range the reeds and o'er the poppies sweep  That nodding bend beneath their load of sleep  By lakes subsiding with a gentle face  And rivers gliding with a silent pace  Where kings and swains by antient authors sung  Now chang'd to flow'rets o'er the margin hung  The selfadmirer white Narcissus so  Fades at the brink his picture fades below  In bells of azure Hyacinth arose  In crimson painted young Adonis glows  The fragrant Crocus shone with golden flame  And leaves inscrib'd with Ajax' haughty name  A sad remembrance brings their lives to view  And with their passion makes their tears renew  Unwinds the years and lays the former scene  Where after death they live for deaths again  Lost by the glories of her lover's state  Deluded Semele bewails her fate  And runs and seems to burn the flames arise  And fan with idle furies as the flies  The lovely Caenis whose transforming shape  Secur'd her honour from a second rape  Now moans the first with ruffl'd dress appears  Feels her whole sex return and bathes with tears  The jealous Procris wipes a seeming wound  Whose trickling crimson dyes the bushy ground  Knows the sad shaft and calls before she go  To kiss the fav'rite hand that gave the blow  O'er a feign'd Ocean's rage the Sestian Fair  Holds a dim taper from a tow'r of air  A noiseless wind assaults the wav'ring light  The beauty tumbling mingles with the night  Where curling shades for rough Leucate rose  With love distracted tuneful Sappho goes  Sings to mockcliffs a melancholy lay  And with a Lover's leap affrights the sea  The sad Eriphyle retreats to moan  What wrought her husband's death and caus'd her own  Surveys the glitt'ring veil the bribe of fate  And tears the shadow but she tears too late  In thin design and airy picture fleet  The tales that stain the Royal House of Crete  To court a lovely bull Pasiphae flies  The snowy phantom feeds before her eyes  Lost Ariadne raves the thread she bore  Trails on unwinding as she walks the shore  And desp'rate Phaedra seeks the lonely groves  To read her guilty letter while she roves  Red shame confounds the first the second wears  A starry crown the third a halter bears  Fair Laodamia mourns her nuptial night  Of love defrauded by the thirst of fight  Yet for another as delusive cries  And dauntless sees her hero's ghost arise  Here Thisbe Canace and Dido stand  All arm'd with swords a fair but angry band  This sword a lover own'd a father gave  The next the last a stranger chanced to leave  And there ev'n she the Goddess of the grove  Join'd with the phantom Fairs affects to rove  As once for Latmos she forsook the plain  To steal the kisses of a slumb'ring swain  Around her head a starry fillet twines  And at the front a silver crescent shines  These and a thousand and a thousand more  With sacred rage recal the pangs they bore  Strike the deep dart afresh and ask relief  Or sooth the wound with soft'ning words of grief  At such a tide unheedful Love invades  The dark recesses of the madding shades  Thro' long descent he fans the fogs around  His purple feathers as he flies resound  The nimble Beauties crouding all to gaze  Confess the common troubler of their ease  Tho' dulling mists and dubious day destroy  The fine appearance of the flutt'ring boy  Tho' all the pomp that glitters at his side  The golden belt the clasp and quiver hid  And tho' the torch appear a gleam of white  That faintly spots and moves thro' haizy night  Yet still they know the God the gen'ral foe  And threat'ning lift their airy hands below  As mindless of their rage he slowly sails  On pinions cumber'd in the misty vales  Ah fool to light the nymphs no more obey  Nor was this region ever his to sway  Cast in a deepen'd ring they close the plain  And seize the God reluctant all in vain  From hence they lead him where a myrtle stood  The saddest myrtle in the mournful wood  Devote to vex the God 'twas here before  Hell's awful empress soft Adonis bore  When the young hunter scorn'd her graver air  And only Venus warm'd his shadow there  Fix'd to the trunk the tender boy they bind  They cord his feet beneath his hands behind  He mourns but vainly mourns his angry fate  For Beauty still relentless acts in hate  Tho' no offence be done no judge be nigh  Love must be guilty by the common cry  For all are pleas'd by partial passion led  To shift their follies on another's head  Now sharp Reproaches ring their shrill alarms  And all the Heroines brandish all their arms  And ev'ry Heroine makes it her decree  That Cupid suffer just the same as she  To fix the desp'rate halter one essay'd  One seeks to wound him with an empty blade  Some headlong hang the nodding rocks of air  They fall in fancy and he feels despair  Some toss the hollow seas around his head  The seas that want a wave afford a dread  Or shake the torch the sparkling fury flies  And flames that never burn'd afflict his eyes  The groaning Myrrha bursts her rinded womb  And drowns his visage in the moist perfume  While others seeming mild advise to wound  With hum'rous pains by sly derision found  That prickling bodkins teach the blood to flow  From whence the roses first begin to glow  Or in the flames to singe the boy prepare  That all shou'd chuse by wanton fancy where  The lovely Venus with a bleeding breast  She too securely thro' the circle prest  Forgot the parent urg'd his hasty fate  And spurr'd the female rage beyond debate  O'er all her scenes of frailty swiftly runs  Absolves herself and makes the crime her son's  That clasp'd in chains with Mars she chanc'd to lye  A noted fable of the laughing sky  That from her Love's intemp'rate heat began  Sicanian Eryx born a savage man  The loose Priapus and the monsterwight  In whom the sexes shamefully unite  Nor words suffice the Goddess of the Fair  She snaps the rosywreath that binds her hair  Then on the God who fear'd a fiercer woe  Her hands unpitying dealt the frequent blow  From all his tender skin a purple dew  The dreadful scourges of the chaplet drew  From whence the rose by Cupid ting'd before  Now doubly tinged flames with lustre more  Here ends their wrath the parent seems severe  The strokes unfit for little Love to bear  To save their foe the melting beauties fly  "And cruel mother spare thy child they cry  To Love's account they plac'd their deaths of late  And now transfer the sad account to fate  The mother pleas'd beheld the storm assuage  Thank'd the calm mourners and dismiss'd her rage  Thus Fancy once in dusky shade exprest  With empty terrors work'd the time of rest  Where wretched Love endur'd a world of woe  For all a Winter's length of night below  Then soar'd as sleep dissolv'd unchain'd away  And thro' the port of Iv'ry reach'd the Day  TO DR SWIFT  URg'd by the warmth of sacred friendship's flame  But more by all the wonders of thy fame  By all those offsprings of thy learned mind  In judgment solid as in wit refin'd  Resolv'd I sing tho' lab'ring up the way  To reach my themeO Swift accept my lay  Rapt by the force of thought and rais'd above  Thro' Contemplation's airy fields I rove  Where pow'rful Fancy purifies my eye  And lights the beauties of a brighter sky  Fresh paints the meadows bids green shades ascend  Clear rivers wind and op'ning plains extend  Then fills its landskip thro' the varied parts  With Virtues Graces Sciences and Arts  Superior forms of more than mortal air  More large than mortals more serenely fair  And there two chiefs the guardians of thy name  Contend to raise thee to the point of fame  Ye future timesI heard the silver sound  I saw the Graces form a circle round  Each where she fix'd attentive seem'd to root  And all but Eloquence herself was mute  High o'er the throng I saw the Goddess rise  Free to the breeze her upper garment flies  By turns within her eye the passions burn  The softer passions languish in their turn  Upon her lips convincing Proof resides  Thro' all her speech Persuasion melting glides  A golden crown confess'd her high command  And waving Action gently grac'd her hand  Out of her bosom where the treasure lay  She drew thy labours to the blaze of day  Then gaz'd and read the charms she could inspire  And taught the list'ning audience to admire  How strong thy flight how large thy grasp of thought  How just thy schemes how regularly wrought  How sure you wound when ironies deride  Which must be seen yet feign to turn aside  How far uncommon with an air of ease  How nicely taking are thy turns of praise  Fame wants no words to make the Patriot shine  But yet to chuse the best must borrow thine  What public spirit in thy works appears  What rolling language fills the ravish'd ears  Where Nature all her force of writing shows  Where Art concealing Art with Nature goes  She ceas'd Applause attended on the close  Then Poetry her sister art arose  Her fairer sister born in deepest ease  Not made so much for bus'ness as to please  Upon her cheeks sits beauty ever young  The soul of music warbles on her tongue  Bright in her eyes a pleasing ardour glows  And from her heart the sweetest temper flows  A laurelwreath adorns her curling hair  And binds their order to the dancing air  She shakes the colours of her radiant wing  While from the spheres she takes her pitch to sing  Thrice happy Genius his whose works have hit  The lucky point of bus'ness and of wit  They seem like show'rs which April months prepare  To call the flow'ry glories up to air  The drops descending make the varied bow  And while they fall for profit dress for show  To me retiring oft he finds relief  From slow consuming care and pining grief  From me retreating oft he gives to view  What eases care and grief in others too  Ye fondly grave be wise enough to know  Life ne'er unbent is but a life of woe  I'll gently steal you from your toils away  Where balmy winds and scents ambrosial play  Where on the banks as chrystal rivers flow  They teach immortal Amaranths to grow  Then from the wild indulgence of the scene  Restore your tempers strong for toils again  She ceas'd Soft Music trembl'd in the wind  And sweet Delight diffus'd thro' ev'ry mind  The little Smiles which still the Goddess grace  Sportive arose and run from face to face  But chief  A gentle band their eager joys express  Here Friendship asks and Love of Merit longs  To hear the Goddesses renew their songs  There great Benevolence to Men is pleas'd  These own their SWIFT and grateful hear him prais'd  You gentle band you well may bear your part  You reign Superior Graces in his heart  O SWIFT if Friendship's warm yet lasting flame  If Love of Merit have to praise a claim  If just esteem from ev'ry temper flows  To crown a tender sense of human woes  These fair returns are thine nor cou'dst thou lye  Unknown alive nor wilt unlovely dye  Or if high fame be life and well we know  That Bards and Heroes have esteem'd it so  Thou can'st not all expire thy Works will shine  To future times and Life in Fame be thine  PIETY OR THE VISION  'TWAS when the night in silent sable fled  When chearful morning sprung with rising red  When dreams and vapours leave to crowd the brain  And best the Vision draws its heav'nly scene  'Twas then as slumb'ring on my couch I lay  A sudden splendor seem'd to kindle day  A breeze came breathing in a sweet perfume  Blown from eternal gardens fill'd the room  And in a void of blue that clouds invest  Appear'd a daughter of the realms of rest  Her head a ring of golden glory wore  Her honour'd hand the sacred volume bore  Her rayment glitt'ring seem'd a silver white  And all her sweet companions sons of light  Strait as I gaz'd my fear and wonder grew  Fear barr'd my voice and wonder  ix'd my view  When lo a cherub of the shining crowd  That sail'd as guardians in her azure cloud  Fann'd the soft air and downward seem'd to glide  And to my lips a living coal applied  Then while the warmth on all my pulses ran  Diffusing comfort thus the maid began  'Where glorious mansions are prepar'd above  'The seats of Music and the seats of Love  'Thence I descend and PIETY my name  'To warm thy bosom with celestial flame  'To teach thee praises mix'd with humble pray'rs  'And tune thy soul to sing seraphic airs  'Be thou my bard' A vial here she caught  An angel's hand the chrystal vial brought  And as with awful sound the word was said  She pour'd a sacred unction on my head  Then thus proceeded 'Be thy muse thy zeal  'Dare to be good and all my joys reveal  'While other pencils flatt'ring forms create  'And paint the gawdy plumes that deck the great  'While other pens exalt the vain delight  'Whose wasteful revel wakes the depth of night  'Or others softly sing in idle lines  'How Damon courts or Amaryllis shines  'More wisely thou select a theme divine  ''Tis Fame's their recompence 'tis Heav'n is thine  'Despise the fervours of unhallow'd fire  'Where wine or passion or applause inspire  'Low restless life and ravings born of earth  'Whose meaner subjects speak their humble birth  'Like working seas that when loud Winters blow  'Not made for rising only rage below  'Mine is a great and yet a lasting heat  'More lasting still as more intensely great  'Produc'd where pray'r and praise and pleasure breathe  'And ever mounting whence it shot beneath  'Unpaint the Love that hov'ring over beds  'From glitt'ring pinions guilty pleasure sheds  'Restore the colour to the golden mines  'With which behind the feather'd idol shines  'To flow'ring greens give back their native care  'The rose and lily never his to wear  'To sweet Arabia send the balmy breath  'Strip the fair flesh and call the phantom Death  'His bow be sabled o'er his shafts the same  'And fork and point them with eternal flame  'But urge thy pow'rs thine utmost voice advance  'Make the loud strings against thy fingers dance  ''Tis Love that angels praise and men adore  ''Tis Love Divine that asks it all and more  'Fling back the gates of everblazing day  'Pour floods of liquid light to gild the way  'And all in glory wrapt thro' paths untrod  'Pursue the great unseen descent of GOD  'Hail the meek VIRGIN bid the CHILD appear  'The CHILD is GOD and call him JESUS here  'He comes but where to rest a manger's nigh  'Make the GREAT BEING in a manger lye  'Fill the wide skies with angels on the wing  'Make thousands gaze and make ten thousands sing  'Let men afflict him men he came to save  'And still afflict him 'till he reach the grave  'Make him resign'd his loads of sorrow meet  'And me like Mary weep beneath his feet  'I'll bathe my tresses there my pray'rs rehoarse  'And glide in flames of love along thy verse  'Hah while I speak I feel my bosom swell  'My raptures smother what I long to tell  ''Tis GOD a present GOD thro' cleaving air  'I see the throne I see the JESUS there  'Plac'd on the right he shows the wounds he bore  'My fervours oft have won him thus before  'How pleas'd he looks my words have reach'd his ear  'He bids the gates unbar and calls me near'  She ceas'd The cloud on which she seem'd to tread  Its curls unsolded and around her spread  Bright angels waft their wings to raise the cloud  And sweep their iv'ry lutes and sing aloud  The scene moves off while all its ambient sky  Is tun'd to wond'rous music as they fly  And soft the swelling sounds of music grow  And faint their softness till they fail below  My dow  y sleep the warmth of Phoebus broke  And while my thoughts were settling thus I spoke  Thou beauteous Vision on the soul imprest  When most my reason wou'd appear  o rest  'Twas sure with pencils dipt in various lights  Some curious angel limn'd thy sacred sights  From blazing suns his radiant gold he drew  White moons the silver gave and air the blue  I'll mount the roving wind's expanded wing  And seek the sacred hill and light to sing  'Tis known in Jewry well I'll make my lays  Obedient to thy summons sound with praise  But still I fear unwarm'd with holy flame  I take for truth the flatt'ries of a dream  And barely wish the wond'rous gift I boast  And faintly practise what deserves it most  "Indulgent LORD whose gracious love displays  Joys in the light and fills the dark with ease  Be this to bless my days no dream of bliss  Or be to bless my nights my dreams like this  ECSTACY  THE fleeting joys which all affords below  Work the fond heart with unavailing show  The wish that makes our happier life compleat  Nor grasps the wealth nor honours of the great  Nor loosely sails on Pleasure's easy stream  Nor gathers wreaths from all the groves of Fame  Weak man who charms to these alone confine  Attend my pray'r and learn to make it thine  "From thy rich throne where circling trains of  Make day that's endless infinitely bright  Thence Heavenly Father thence with mercy dart  One beam of brightness to my longing heart  Dawn through the mind drive Error's clouds away  And still the rage in Passion's troubled sea  That the poor banish'd soul serene and free  May rise from earth to visit heav'n and thee  Come Peace Divine shed gently from above  Inspire my willing bosom wond'rous Love  Thy purpl'd pinions to my shoulders tye  And point the passage where I want to fly  But whither whither now what pow'rful fire  With this bless'd influence equals my desire  I rise or Love the kind deluder reigns  And acts in fancy such inchanted scenes  Earth less'ning flies the parting skies retreat  The fleecy clouds my waving feathers beat  And now the sun and now the stars are gone  Yet still methinks the spirit bears me on  Where tracts of aether purer blue display  And edge the golden realm of native day  O strange enjoyment of a bliss unseen  O ravishment O sacred rage within  Tumultuous pleasure rais'd on peace of mind  Sincere excessive from the world refin'd  I see the light that veils the throne on high  A light unpierc'd by man's impurer eye  I hear the words that issuing thence proclaim  "Let God's attendants praise his awful name"  Then heads unnumber'd bend before the shrine  Mysterious seat of Majesty Divine  And hands unnumber'd strike the silver string  And tongues unnumber'd Hallelujah sing  See where the shining seraphim appear  And sink their decent eyes with holy fear  See flights of angels all their feathers raise  And range the orbs and as they range they praise  Behold the great Apostles joyful met  And high on pearls of azure aether set  Behold the Prophets full of heav'nly fire  With wand'ring fingers wake the trembling lyre  And hear the Martyrs tune and all around  The church triumphant makes the region sound  With harps of gold with boughs of evergreen  With robes of white the pious throngs are seen  Exalted anthems all their hours employ  And all is music and excess of joy  Charm'd with the sight I long to bear a part  The pleasure flutters at my ravish'd heart  Sweet saints and angels of the heav'nly quire  If Love has warm'd me with celestial fire  Assist my words and as they move along  With Hallelujah crown the burthen'd song  Father of all above and all below  O great beyond expression  No bounds thy knowledge none thy pow'r confine  For pow'r and knowledge in their source are thine  Around thee glory spreads her golden wing  Sing glitt'ring angels Hallelujah sing  Son of the Father first begotten Son  Ere the short meas'ring line of time begun  The world has seen thy works and joy'd to see  His bright effulgence manifest in thee  The world must own thee Love's unfathom'd spring  Sing glitt'ring angels Hallelujah sing  Proceeding Spirit equally divine  In whom the Godhead's full perfections shine  With various graces comforts unexprest  With holy transports you refine the breast  And earth is heav'nly where your gifts you bring  Sing glitt'ring angels Hallelujah sing  But where's my rapture where my wond'rous heat  What interruption makes my bliss retreat  This world's got in the thought of t'other's crost  And the gay picture's in my fancy lost  With what an eager zeal the conscious soul  Would claim its seat and soaring pass the pole  But our attempts these chains of earth restrain  Deride our toil and drag us down again  So from the ground aspiring meteors go  And rank'd with planets light the would below  But their own bodies sink them in the sky  When the warmth's gone that taught them how to fly  FINIS
