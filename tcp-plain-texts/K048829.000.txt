 ANNETTE and LUBIN A COMIC OPERA IN ONE ACT  Price SIXPENCE  ANNETTE and LUBIN A COMIC OPERA IN ONE ACT  As it is performed at the THEATREROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY No FleetStreet MDCCLXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following little Piece is an imitation of the French comic operas of one act which are generally characterized either by their natural simplicity or some single striking incident and little or nothing more is designedIt is now first attempted to introduce this species of entertainment on the English theatre as containing excellent situations for light airsOn the French stage notwithstanding all their merit they tire in the length of time taken for representation and were they spun out to the common length of our afterpieces it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient  The subject matter therefore being wholly preserved and the dialogue both varied and compressed they are with every deference submitted to public judgment  C

the Seinenear the front of the stage is a little cabin made with leaves not quite finishedLubin comes on with a load of branches on his back  AIR  'TIS late in the day  Work away work away  At the cottage where Annette's to dwell  I sing as the branches I fell  'Tis not fine 'tis not gay  But 'tis done for her sake  And the pains which I take  Love and her will repay  Mighty well  For a carpet to serve where she'll tread  This matting of ozier I spread  Come Lubin my lad work away  Love and Annette thy toil will repay  If the housen of your great folks in town are larger and a got more chambers than ours I can tell 'em those within lead sadder livesHere Annette and I are happier than a king and queenone branch the more if we are cold keeps out the wind and the rainIf we are warm one branch the less lets in the air to fan usand when the sun scorches up the leaves away trudge I as I did this morning to the wood and bring home a new house upon my backAnnette will be struck all of a heap when she comes home to see how gay we look  singing behind  Ah there she is I'll work away without seeming to mind her  SCENE II  LUBIN ANNETTE  An  behind  The village all may rave and scold  To taunt and rail and jeer they're free  The young with sneers with threats the old  Still Lubin is the lad for me  Lub  Here comes Annette  Let us nothing forget  Well said my boy Lubin well said  Thy toil to compleat  On this hillock her seat  These pansies and violets spread  An  behind  The Bailly does our conduct blame  Cousins to lovethat must not be  But did the parson cry out shame  Lubin is the lad for me  Lub  I hear her I hear her  Come nearer and nearer  Let's see have I got ev'ry thing  When she speaks one may guess  How her accents can bless  If one's charmed thus in hearing her sing  An  behind  They say this joy will end in smart  That all the men are falsebut he  Is true if I may trust my heart  And Lubin is the lad for me  Lub  My Annette I hear  That Annette so dear  Who so much I regret when away  That the sky seems to lour  And evr'y hour  To me is as long as a day  A  coming on  But wherefore in a moment's pain  He's here and I from doubt am free  That smile which welcomes me again  Says Lubin is the lad for me  Both  But wherefore in a moment's c  An  Here I amI am quite out of breath  Lub  You have been a good while gone  An  I am sure I run as fast as ever I could  Lub  Yes you have made yourself all in a heatwhat did you run so fast for  An  Oh that was only as I come back againwhen I leave you I go slow enoughOh dear how fine we are  Lub  Not very fine Annette but it will be main pretty when thou art within it  An  Ah Lubin how glad I was to come back to theeEn't we much happier than the people in town  Lub  Happiera thousand times on the finest days in all the year they shut themselves up in a parcel of quarries Is it not true that our cabin is prettier than their fine prisons which they call palaces  An  For my part I wonder they don't come in the fine weather and live two and two in a little hut as we doHave you seen Lubin their carpets they are so fond ofLord they en't a quarter so pretty as a bed of daisies  Lub  And Annette hast thee observed how they try to make their walls look like the country by sticking a parcel of pictures about themThey say too it costs them a mint of money if that's the case I am sure they are great fools for our pictures here are ten times handsomer and we have them for nothing  An  Dear me t'other day when I carried some milk to my lord's I heard a band of musick tooLord Lubin what a terrible noise I could not help saying if they wanted musick why did not they come and hear our nightingales  Lub  Well said Annette  An  Ah but dear Lubin I met that nasty Bailly again and he says he'll come and scold thee for loving me so much  Lub  Oh he will will he▪I'll give him as good as he brings'tis a plaguy strange thing they can't let us aloneI'cod in our village the folks no sooner see two people happy but they try to make them as miserable as they can  An  Indeed he frightens me out of my witsI can't tell thee what a heap of stuff he saysthat we are cousins and that we love one anotherI am sure I thought all we did was out of goodwill but he shewed me as plain as could be that it was all love and that love is a terrible thing  AIR  Young and void of art or guile  From ill intentions free  If love I've cherish'd all this while  It came in 'spight of me  When you've to me and I've to you  Try'd who cou'd kindest prove  If that was lovewhat then to do  To fly from this same love  II  When absent from you I have mourn'd  And thought each hour a score  When on a sudden you return'd  I've thrill'd with joy all o'er  They say 'twas loveI thought 'twas you  Had made my heart thus move  Alas what can a poor girl do  To fly from this same love  III  To every thing that you can ask  What should I say but yes  It is because I like the task  I freely grant each kiss  You're all to meI'm all to you  This truth our deaths would prove  Were we to partWhat then to do  To fly from this same love  Lub  Never mind them Annettewe'll be happy in spight of themI'll go and see that the sheep don't stray from the valleyand then you shall hear what I'll say to Mr Bailly  SCENE III  ANNETTE and the BAILLY  An  Sitting in the cabin  I don't care if they won't let me love Lubin I'll never love any body especially after being to him as I amPoor soul what pains he takes for me and then we have neither kin nor kindand as I often says who should love us if we don't love one another  Here the Bailiff who had stole behind the cabin to listen puts the branches aside and thrusts in his head and hands  Bail  E'nt you ashamed of yourself  An  Lord you frightened me out of my wits  Bail  Are these the lessons of your late motherThe poor woman  An  Why what's the matter with youYou are always in a passion  Bail  Did she instruct you to listen to the men  An  Oh Lord I never does any such thing  Bail  And Lubin you baggage Lubin  AIR  Bail  They tell me you listen to all that he says  That each hour of the day you are full of his praise  That you always together your flocks lead to graze  Is this true damsel  An  Yes Mister Bailly  Bail  They tell me also you are so void of grace  As to brag that dear form and that sweet pretty face  That young dog shall be welcome to kiss and embrace  Is this true damsel  An  Yes Mister Bailly  II  Bail  The neighbours all say though I credit them not  They have heard you declare that content with your lot  Any King you'd refuse for that lout and a cot  Is this true damsel  An  Yes Mister Bailly  Bail  But one thing I vow frights me out of my life  'Tis allowed on all hands that is barring the strife  That you both live together just like man and wife  Is this true damsel  An  Yes Mister Bailly  Bail  HowHow's this you have granted him then  An  Every thing I can assure youI should be sorry indeed if Lubin and I had any thing to refuse one another  Bail  What confidenceAnd pray tell me the first time this misfortune happened to you did it not thunder and lighten Did not the sun hide itself  An  Oh no 'twas the finest day I ever saw in all my life  Bail  But do you know what a crime you have been guilty of  An  I don't know what a crime isBut for what has happened I can safely swear 'twas all done out of love and kindness and not out of malice the least bit in the world  Bail  You are cousins I tell you  An  Well suppose we are  Bail  Suppose you are Why in that consists the crimeMy Lord is hunting hard by he must be made acquainted with this affairLord Lord What will this world come to  AIR  Lord Lord if to pass are permitted these ways  We shan't quietly sleep in our beds  It calls out for vengeance and one of these days  The thunder will fall on our heads  And shall I such enormities tamely behold  Who fight under Justice's banner  Who as Bailiff and Steward am placeman twofold  To his honour the Lord of the Manor  II  If your mother you baggage was not dead and gone  Between you and that wicked young thief  We should shortly see written upon her tomb stone  That her daughter had killed her with grief  And shall I c  SCENE IV  ANNETTE and LUBIN  An  Dear me I am all in a twitterWhat wickedness have poor Lubin and I been guilty of For after all we have done no harm to any body  Lub  What's the matter AnnetteYou are crying  An  Oh Lubin the Bailly has been here and he says that we have been guilty of a crimeDo you knowwhat a crime is Lubin  Lub  A crimeYes a crime is a very wicked thing'Tis a crime to take away a life but I never heard 'twas a crime to give itThe Bailly is an old fool and does not know what he says  An  I am sure he is a wicked man to come here and make me all in a trembleI could cry my eyes outThe poor child will hate its mother the Bailly told me soand we have been guilty of a sin  Lub  What sin my dear Annette  AIR  Lub  'Tis true that oft in the same mead  We both have led our flocks to feed  Where by each other's side we've sat  An  Alas there was no harm in that  Lub  'Tis true for thee this cot I rose  Where thou takest pleasure to repose  For which I found the greenest plat  An  Alas there was no harm in that  II  Lub  'Tis true when tired thou fain would rest  And thy dear lips to mine I've press'd  Thy breath so sweet I've wondered at  An  Alas there was no harm in that  Lub  Ah but 'tis true when thou hast slept  Closer and closer have I crept  And while my heart went pitapat  An  Alas there was no harm in that  Lub  Ay ay we may think but 'twill be no easy matter to find any harm we have donehang it Annette let them talk till their hearts ach and let us love one another in spight of them  An  The Bailly said my Lord was a coming this way and he'd acquaint him with it  Lub  Wounds Annette I desires no betterMy Lord is kindness itself that every body  knows and we should be the first unfortunate folks that went away from

They can't endure to see it  For me I never shall repine  Let whate'er fate o'ertake us  For love and Annette shall be mine  Tho' all the world forsake us  II  Then dear Annette regard them not  The hours we'll pass on gayly  And laugh at every snare and plot  Of that old doating Bailly  No never Annette thou'lt repine  Let whate'er fate o'ertake us  For love and Lubin shall be thine  Though all

don't be asham'd here is his Honour's Lordship  Bail  Your Lordship is acquainted with the affair and here and please you are the criminals  Lub  My Lord if it shall please you I'll tell you the long and the short on't The Bailly here says that we must be married to have children and that we can't be married because we are cousins and so that being we are guilty of a great sin and that all the world will cry out shame of us and that if any harm happens in the country we shall be the cause of itIn short and please your Lordship's honour the Bailly gives us to the Devil and so as a body may say we recommend ourselves to your Lordship  The  Lord  Constraining a laugh  My children the Bailiff is rightBut comfort yourselves and tell me ingenuously the whole truth  Lub  There did not I tell you his Lordship  would be kind to us Speak to his honour Annette  AIR ANNETTE  My Lord and please you him and I  Morn noon and night in every weather  From little children not this high  In the same cottage liv'd together  Our parents left me to his care  Saying let no one put upon her  No that I won't says he I swear  And he ne'er lies and like your honour  II  As I was saying we grew up  For all the world sister and brother  One never had nor bit nor sup  Unless it was partook by t'other  And I am sure instead of me  Were it a Dutchess he had won her  He is so good and P  e d'ye see  A tender heart and like your honour  III  But woe is ours now comes the worst  Today our sorrows are beginning  What I thought loveoh I shall burst  That nasty Bailly says was sinning  With Lubin who of all the bliss  I ever tasted is the donor  I took delight to toy and kiss  'Till I'm with child and like your honour  And so my Lord you see what has happened and if I have done any harm I shall die with shame  Lub  Pray don't let Annette die my LordI should die too and that would be a pityIf you could but have seen how we lived together before this Old Bailly came and frighten'd us so Nothing was ever so gayAll that vexes us is he says my child won't know its father nor mother and that it will reproach us with its birth  An  'Twill reproach me in my grave then  The  Lord  They really interest meDon't afflict yourselves you are not criminal you are only unfortunate if you were rich you might obtain a permission to love and be united 'tis not just that because you are poor you should be denied so equitable a desireI'll take this matter upon myself and the week shall not pass before I procure a dispensation from the church to reward your innocence and affection as it deserves  AIR  Bailly  His Lordship really is too good  What will the people say  Marry two folks one flesh and blood  Henceforth young maids will stray  The wolf will creep  Among the sheep  Corn will on fire be set  What can come less  From the wickedness  Of Lubin and Annette  Annette  Peace mister Baileyfor my Lord  Has now untied my tongue  And I may bold put in my word  I own we've been so wrong  Our former shame  Each fair should blame  And yet without regret  Might imitate  The future state  Of Lubin and Annette▪  Lubin  Wounds let un talk and talk again  He'll never get his ends  His spite will give me little pain  If here we find but friends  Forgive's the word  You see my lord  Has the example set  Do'e then pray  Clap hands and say  Smile Lubin and Annette  THE END
