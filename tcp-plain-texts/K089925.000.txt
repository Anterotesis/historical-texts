By RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN Esq  LONDON Printed for G WILKIE No St Paul's Churchyard MDCCLXXXI  PROLOGUE  Written by DAVID GARRICK Esq  Spoken by Mr KING  WHAT various transformations we remark  From East Whitechapel to the West Hydepark  Men women children houses signs and fashions  State stage trade taste the humours and the passions  Th' Exchange 'Change alley wheresoe'er your ranging  Court city country all are chang'd or changing  The streets sometime ago were pav'd with stones  Which aided by a hackney coach half broke your bones  The purest lovers then indulg'd no bliss  They run great hazard if they stole a kiss  One chaste salutethe Damsel cry'd O fye  As they approach'd slap went the coach awry  Poor Sylvia got a bump and Damon a black eye  But now weak nerves in hackney coaches roam  And the cramm'd glutton snores unjolted home  Of former times that polish'd thing a  Beau  Is metamorphos'd now from top to toe  Then the full flaxen wig spread o'er the shoulders  Conceal'd the shallow head from the beholders  But now the whole's revers'deach fop appears  Cropp'd and trimm'd upexposing head and ears  The buckle then it's modest limits knew  Now like the ocean dreadful to the view  Hath broke it's bounds and swallows up the shoe  The wearer's foot like his once fine estate  Is almost lost th'  incumbrance  is so great  Ladies may smileare they not in the plot  The bounds of nature have not they forgot  Were they design'd to be when put together  Made up like shuttlecocks of cork and feather  Their pale fac'd grandmama's appear'd with grace  When dawning blushes rose upon the face  No blushes now their once lov'd station seek  The foe is in possession of the cheek  No head of old too high in feather'd state  Hinder'd the fair to pass the lowest gate  A church to enter now they must be bent  If ev'n they should try th' experiment  As change thus circulates throughout the nation  Some plays may justly call for alteration  At least to draw some slender cov'ring o'er  That graceless wit  And  Van  wants Grace who never wanted Wit POPE  which was too bare before  Those writers well and wisely use their pens  Who turn our Wantons into Magdalens  And howsoever wicked wits revile 'em  We hope to find in you their Stage Asylum  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Lord FOPPINGTON  Mr Dodd  YOUNG FASHION  Mr Palmer  LOVELESS  Mr Smith  Colonel TOWNLEY

old house which nobody comes  near She never goes abroad nor sees company at home to prevent all misfortunes she has her breeding within doors the parson of the parish teaches her to play upon the dulcimer the clerk to sing her nurse to dress and her father to dancein short nobody has free admission there but our old acquaintance Mother Coupler who has procured your brother this match and is I believe a distant relation of Sir Tunbelly's  Y FASHION  But is her fortune so considerable  TOWNLY  Three thousand a year and a good sum of money independent of her father beside  Y FASHION  'Sdeath

present most whimsically circumstancedI came here near a month ago to meet the lady you mention but she failing in her promise I partly from pique and partly from idleness have been diverting my chagrin by offering up chaste incense to the beauties of Amanda our friend Loveless's wife  Y FASHION  I have never seen her but have heard her spoken of as a youthful wonder of beauty and prudence  TOWNLY  She is so indeed and Loveless being too careless and insensible of the treasure he possessesmy lodging in the same house has given me a thousand opportunities of making my assiduities acceptable so that in less than a fortnight I began to bear my disappointment from the widow with the most Christian resignation  Y FASHION  And Berinthia has never appear'd  TOWNLY  O there's the perplexity for just as I began not to care whether I ever saw her again or not last night she arrived  Y FASHION  And instantly reassumed her empire  TOWNLY  No faithwe metbut the lady not

kind I had the honour to furnish your Lordship with in town  LD FOPPINGTON  Very possibly Mr Mendlegs but that was in the beginning of the winter and you should always remember Mr Hosier that if you make a Nobleman's spring legs as robust as his autumnal calves you commit a manstrous impropriety and make no allowance for the fatigues of the winter  JEW  I hope my Lord those buckles have had the unspeakable satisfaction of being honoured with your Lordship's approbation  LD FOPPINGTON  Why they are of a pretty fancy but don't you think them rather of the smallest  JEW  My Lord they could not

You may before the weddingday yet the lady is a great heiress the match is concluded the writings are drawn and his lordship is come hither to put the finishing hand to the business  Y FASHION  I understand as much  COUPLER  Now you must know stripling your brother's a knave  Y FASHION  Good  COUPLER  He has given me a bond of a thousand pounds for helping him to his fortune and has promised me as much more in ready money upon the day of the marriage which I understand by a friend he never designs to pay me and his just now refusing to pay me a part is a proof of it If therefore you will be a generous young rogue and secure me five thousand pounds I'll help you to the lady  Y FASHION  And how the devil wilt thou do that  COUPLER  Without the devil's aid I warrant thee Thy brother's face not one of the family ever saw the whole business has been managed by me and all the letters go thro' my hands Sir Tunbelly Clumsey my relation for that's the old gentleman's name is apprized of

Lory Providence thou seest at last takes care of merit we are in a fair way to be great people  LORY  Aye sir if the devil don't step between the cup and the lip as he uses to do  Y FASHION  Why faith he has play'd me many a damn'd trick to spoil my fortune and egad I'm almost afraid he's at work about it again now but if I should tell thee how thou'dst wonder at me  LORY  Indeed sir I should not  Y FASHION  How dost know  LORY  Because sir I have wondered at you so often I can wonder at you no more  Y FASHION  No what wouldst thou say if a qualm of conscience should spoil my design  LORY  I would eat my words and wonder more than ever  Y FASHION  Why faith Lory tho' I am a young Rakehell  and have play'd many a rogueish trick this is so fullgrown a cheat I find I must take pains to come up to'tI have scruples  LORY  They are strong symptoms of death If you find they encrease sir pray make your will  Y FASHION  No my conscience shan't starve me neither but thus far I'll listen to it Before I execute this project I'll try my brother to the bottom If he has yet so much humanity about him as to assist me tho' with a moderate aid I'll drop my project at his feet and shew him how I can do for him much more than what I'd ask he'd do for me This one conclusive trial of him I resolve to make  Succeed or fail still victory's my lot  If I subdue his heart 'tis wellif not  I will subdue my conscience to my plot  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Enter  LOVELESS and AMANDA  LOVELESS  HOW do you like these lodgings my dear For my part I am so well pleas'd with them I shall hardly remove whilst we stay here if you are satisfied  AMANDA  I am satisfied with every thing that pleases you else I had not come to Scarbro' at all  LOVELESS  O a little of the noise and folly of this place will sweeten the pleasures of our retreat we shall find the charms of our retirement doubled when we return to it  AMANDA  That pleasing prospect will be my chiefest entertainment whilst much against my will I engage in those empty pleasures which 'tis so much the fashion to be fond of  LOVELESS  I own most of them are indeed but empty yet there are delights of which a private life is destitute which may divert an honest man and be a harmless entertainment to a virtuous woman good musick is one and truly with some small allowance the plays I think may be esteemed another  AMANDA  Plays I must confess have some small charms and would have more would they restrain that loose encouragement to vice which shocks if not the virtue of some women at least the modesty of all  LOVELESS  But 'till that reformation can be wholly made 'twould surely be a pity to exclude the productions of some of our best writers for want of a little wholesome pruning which might be effected by any one who possessed modesty enough to believe that we should preserve all we can of our deceased authors at least 'till they are outdone by the living ones  AMANDA  What do you think of that you saw last night  LOVELESS  To say truth I did not mind it much my attention was for some time taken off to admire the workmanship of Nature in the face of a young lady who sat some distance from me she was so exquisitely handsome  AMANDA  So exquisitely handsome  LOVELESS  Why do you repeat my words my dear  AMANDA  Because you seem'd to speak them with such pleasure I thought I might oblige you with their echo  LOVELESS  Then you are alarm'd Amanda  AMANDA  It is my duty to be so when you are in danger  LOVELESS  You are too quick in apprehending for me I view'd her with a world of admiration but not one glance of love  AMANDA  Take heed of trusting to such nice distinctions But were your eyes the only things that were inquisitive Had I been in your place my tongue I fancy had been curious too I should have ask'd her where she liv'd yet still without design who was she pray  LOVELESS  Indeed I cannot tell  AMANDA  You will not tell  LOVELESS  By all that's sacred then I did not ask  AMANDA  Nor do you know what company was with her  LOVELESS  I do not but why are you so earnest  AMANDA  I thought I had cause  LOVELESS  But you thought wrong Amanda for turn the case and let it be your story should you come home and tell me you had seen a handsome man should I grow jealous because you had eyes  AMANDA  But should I tell you he was  exquisitely  so and that I had gazed on him with admiration should you not think 'twere possible I might go one step further and enquire his name  LOVELESS    Aside    She has reason on her side I have talk'd too much but I must turn off another way    To her    Will you then make no difference Amanda between the language of our sex and yours There is a modesty restrains your tongues which makes you speak by halves when you commend but roving flattery gives a loose to ours which makes us still speak double what we think You should not therefore in so strict a sense take what I said to her advantage  AMANDA  Those flights of flattery sir are to our faces only when women are once out of hearing you are as modest in your commendations as we are but I shan't put you to the trouble of farther excusesif you please this business shall rest here only give me leave to wish both for your peace and mine that you may never meet this miracle of beauty more  LOVELESS  I am content  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Madam there is a lady at the door in a chair desires to know whether your Ladyship sees company her name is Berinthia  AMANDA  O dear'tis a relation I have not seen these five years pray her to walk in    Exit Serv    Here's another beauty for you she was when I saw her last reckoned extremely handsome  LOVELESS  Don't be jealous now for I shall gaze upon her too  Enter  BERINTHIA  LOVELESS    Aside    Haby Heav'ns the very woman  BERINTHIA    Saluting  Amanda  Dear Amanda I did not expect to meet with you in Scarbro'  AMANDA  Sweet cousin I'm overjoy'd to see you    To  Lov  Mr Loveless here's a relation and a friend of mine I desire you'll be better acquainted with  LOVELESS    Saluting  Berinthia  If my wife never desires a harder thing Madam her request will be easily granted  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Sir my Lord Foppington presents his humble service to you and desires to know how you do He's at the next door and if it be not inconvenient to you he'll come and wait upon you  LOVELESS  Give my compliments to his Lordship and I shall be glad to see him    Exit Serv    If you are not acquainted with his Lordship Madam you will be entertained with his character  AMANDA  Now it moves my pity more than my mirth to  see a man whom Nature has made no sool be so very industrious to pass for an ass  LOVELESS  No there you are wrong Amanda you should never bestow your pity upon those who take pains for your contempt pity those whom Nature abuses never those who abuse Nature  Enter  LORD FOPPINGTON  LD FOPPINGTON  Dear Loveless I am your most humble servant  LOVELESS  My Lord I'm your's  LD FOPPINGTON  Madam your Ladyship's very humble slave  LOVELESS  My Lord this lady is a relation of my wife's  LD FOPPINGTON    Saluting her    The beautifullest race of people upon earth rat me Dear Loveless I am overjoyed that you think of continuing here I am stap my vitals    To  Amanda  For Gad's sake Madam how has your ladyship been able to subsist thus long under the fatigue of a country life  AMANDA  My life has been very far from that my Lord it has been a very quiet one  LD FOPPINGTON  Why that's the fatigue I speak of Madam for 'tis impossible to be quiet without thinking now thinking is to me the greatest fatigue in the world  AMANDA  Does not your lordship love reading then  LD FOPPINGTON  Oh passionately Madam but I never think of what I read  BERINTHIA  Why can your lordship read without thinking  LD FOPPINGTON  O Lard can your ladyship pray without devotion Madam  AMANDA  Well I must own I think books the best entertainment in the world  LD FOPPINGTON  I am so much of your ladyship's mind Madam that I have a private gallery in town where I walk sometimes which is furnished with nothing but books and looking glasses Madam I have gilded them and ranged them so prettily before Gad it is the most entertaining thing in the world to walk and look at them  AMANDA  Nay I love a neat library too but 'tis I think the inside of a book should recommend it most to us  LD FOPPINGTON  That I must confess I am not altogether so fand of far to my mind the inside of a book is to entertain one's self with the forced product of another man's brain Now I think a man of quality and breeding may be much more diverted with the natural sprauts of his own but to say the truth Madam let a  man love reading never so well when once he comes to know the tawn he finds so many better ways of passing away the fourandtwenty hours that it were ten thousand pities he should consume his time in that Far example Madam now my life my life Madam is a perpetual stream of pleasure that glides through with such a variety of entertainments I believe the wisest of our ancestors never had the least conception of any of 'em I rise Madam when in town about twelve o'clock I don't rise sooner because it is the worst thing in the world for the complexion nat that I pretend to be a beau but a man must endeavour to look decent lest he makes so odious a figure in the sidebax the ladies should be compelled to turn their eyes upon the play so at twelve o'clock I say I rise Naw if I find it a good day I resalve to take the exercise of riding so drink my chocolate and draw on my boots by two On my return I dress and after dinner lounge perhaps to the Opera  BERINTHIA  Your lordship I suppose is fond of music  LD FOPPINGTON  O passionately on Tuesdays and Saturdays provided there is good company and one is not expected to undergo the fatigue of listening  AMANDA  Does your lordship think that the case at the Opera  LD FOPPINGTON  Most certainly Madam there is my Lady Tattle my Lady Prate my Lady Titter my Lady Sneer my Lady Giggle and my Lady Grinthese have boxes in the front and while any favourite  air is singing are the prettiest company in the waurld stap my vitals May'nt we hope for the honour to see you added to our society Madam  AMANDA  Alas my Lord I am the worst company in the world at a concert I'm so apt to attend to the music  LD FOPPINGTON  Why Madam that is very pardonable in the country or at church but a monstrous inattention in a polite assembly But I am afraid I tire the company  LOVELESS  Not at all pray go on  LD FOPPINGTON  Why then ladies there only remains to add that I generally conclude the evening at one or other of the Clubs nat that I ever play deep indeed I have been for some time tied up from losing above five thousand pawnds at a sitting  LOVELESS  But is'nt your Lordship sometimes obliged to attend the weighty affairs of the nation  LD FOPPINGTON  Sir as to weighty affairs I leave them to weighty heads I never intend mine shall be a burthen to my body  BERINTHIA  Nay my Lord but you are a pillar of the state  LD FOPPINGTON  An ornamental pillar Madam for sooner than undergo any part of the burthen rat me but the whole building should fall to the ground  AMANDA  But my Lord a fine gentleman spends a great deal of his time in his intrigues you have given us no account of them yet  LD FOPPINGTON    Aside    Soh She would enquire into my amours that's jealousy poor soul I see she's in love with me    To her    Why Madam I should have mentioned my intrigues but I am really afraid I begin to be troublesome with the length of my visit  AMANDA  Your lordship is too entertaining to grow troublesome any where  LD FOPPINGTON    Aside    That now was as much as if she had said pray make love to me I'll let her see I'm quick of apprehension    To her    O Lard Madam I had like to have forgot a secret I must needs tell your ladyship    To  Lov  Ned you must not be so jealous now as to listen  LOVELESS  Not I my

heav'ns apologize for my conductapologise to youO you barbarianBut pray now my good serious Colonel have you any thing more to add  TOWNLY  Nothing madam but that after such behaviour I am less surpris'd at what I saw just now it is not very wonderful that the woman who can trifle with the delicate addresses of an honourable lover should be found coquetting with the husband of her friend  BERINTHIA  Very trueno more wonderful than it was for this  honourable  lover to divert himself in the absence of this coquet with endeavouring to seduce his friend's wife O Colonel Colonel don't talk

too dangerous a Being to trifle with and as I shall probably only make a fool of you at last I believe we had better let matters rest as they are  LOVELESS  You cannot mean it sure  BERINTHIA  Nowhy do you think you are really so irresistable and master of so much address as to deprive a woman of her senses in a few days acquaintance  LOVELESS  O no Madam 'tis only by your preserving your senses that I can hope to be admitted into your favouryour taste judgment and discernment are what I build my hopes on  BERINTHIA  Very modest upon my wordand it certainly follows that the greatest proof I can give of my possessing those qualities would be my admiring Mr Loveless  LOVELESS  O that were so cold a proof  BERINTHIA  What shall I do moreesteem you  LOVELESS  O noworse and worseCan you

I speak from convictionThis very day I saw them together and overheard  AMANDA  Peace Sir I will not even listen to such slanderthis is a poor device to work on my resentment to listen to your insidious addresses No Sir though Mr Loveless may be capable of error I am convinced I cannot be deceived so grossly in him as to believe what you now report and for Berinthia you should have fixed on some more probable person for my rival than she who is my relation and my friend for while I am myself free from guilt I will never believe that love can beget injury or confidence create ingratitude  TOWNLY  If I do not prove this to you  AMANDA  You never shall have an opportunityfrom the artful manner in which you first shew'd yourself to me I might have been led as far as virtue permitted to have thought you less criminal than unhappybut this last unmanly artifice merits at once my resentment and contempt    Exit  TOWNLY  Sure there's divinity about her and she has dispensed some portion of honor's light to me  yet can I bear to lose Berinthia without revenge or compensationPerhaps she is not so culpable as I thought her I was mistaken when I began to think lightly of Amanda's virtue

don't pretend that I ever entertain'd a thought  LOVELESS  Why then sincerely and honestly Berinthia there is something in my wife's conduct which strikes me so forcibly that if it were not for shame  and the fear of hurting you in her opinion I swear I would follow her confess my error and trust to her generosity for forgiveness  BERINTHIA  Nay prithee don't let your respect for me prevent you for as my object in trifling with you was nothing more than to pique Townly and as I perceive he has been actuated by a similar motive you may depend on't I shall make no mystery of the matter to him  LOVELESS  By no means inform himfor tho' I may chuse to pass by his conduct without resentment how will he presume to look me in the face again  BERINTHIA  How will you presume to look him in the face again  LOVELESS  Hewho has dared to attempt the honour of my wife  BERINTHIA  Youwho have dared to attempt the honour of his mistressCome come be ruled by me who affect more levity than I have and don't think of anger in this cause A Readiness to resent injuries is a virtue only in those who are slow to injure  LOVELESS  Then I will be ruled by youand when you shall think proper to undeceive Townly may your good qualities make as sincere a convert of him as Amanda's have of me When truth's extended from us then we own the robe of virtue is a secret habit  Could women but our secret
