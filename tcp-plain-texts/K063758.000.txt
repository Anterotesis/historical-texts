 THE HISTORY OF THE Earl of  WARWICK  Sirnam'd The KINGMAKER Containing his AMOURS And other Memorable Transactions  By the Author of the  Memoirs of the English Court  To which is added The Remaining Part of the Unknown Lady's Pacquet of LETTERS taken from her by a  French  Privateer in her Passage to  Holland  suppos'd to be Written by several Persons of Quality Brought over from St  Maloes  by an  English  Officer at the last Exchange of Prisoners  LONDON  Printed and Sold by  J Woodward  in St  Christopher  's  Churchyard Thredneedlestreet  and  J Morphew  near  StationersHall    THE PREFACE  THE Author of the following Treatise having gain'd so Ʋniversal an Applause in her several Pieces in most Parts of  Europe  that it would be judg'd superfluous to enlarge our selves in her Praise I have only a few Words to add concerning the History it self The Reader will here meet with a most agreeable Intermixture of Passions which produc'd the most surprizing Events and Revolutions in this Island that can well be imagin'd so artificially and curiously interwoven within one another that the whole Intertexture represents to you Ambition Courage Love and Constancy in their most exalted Vigour and Strength and that upon so exact a Level that it is hard to judge for some time which is either the most predominant or the most likely to triumph over the rest At last Love exerts her utmost Charms and gives us undeniable Proofs of the absolute sway She bares even in the most Memorable Actions of the Greatest of Men and the most Stupendious Events in the World You will here see King  Edward  more than once venturing his Crown for  the Love of Madam  Grey  and upon the Point of losing it for ever You will see here I say the Great Earl of  Warwick  who had the Art of gaining of Crowns forfeit them to his Love As his Fall is an undeniable Instance that even in the Transactions of the highest Moment the Passions of Princes have often a greater Share than the most profound Reasons of State so it may serve as a Warning to all Favourites and make them reflect on the Instability of their Greatness which is built upon so slippery a Foundation Two Great tho' Ʋnfortunate Heroes are suing for your Favour in hopes that since they have made so glorious a Figure Abroad we will not suffer to our Confusion that their Memory should be lessen'd among their own Posterity I had almost forgot to add That since some of the  Lady's Letters  found in her Cabinet could not be inserted in the  Memoirs of the English Court  least the Book should have swell'd to too great a Bulk it was thought fit to annex them to this  MEMOIRS OF THE Earl of  WARWICK  PART I  HENRY  of  Lancaster  King of  England  had reign'd peaceably near thirty years when  Richard  Duke of  York  whose Ancestors were once in full Possession of that Crown resolv'd to lay hold of that favourable Juncture which then offer'd it self to assert and maintain his Right in conjunction with  Edward  Earl of  Marche  his Son and  Richard Neville  Earl of  Warwick  his most intimate Friend These having raised a good number of Troops and back'd by a strong Party made War upon King  Henry  It seem'd as if Fortune had pitch'd upon the Kingdom of  England  to make it the Theater of its capricious Chance After several Battles fought with different success the Duke of  York  being upon the point of giving another to his Rival  Andrew Tralop  an ancient brave Officer in whom he much confided unexpectedly went over  with all his Forces to the King so that seeing himself thus weakned he had no other way left than to retire as fast as he could The Earls of  la Marche  and  Warwick  left him at that Conjuncture the better to repair this sudden Disappointment and having rais'd fresh Troops march'd towards  London  where having all this while maintain'd a secret Correspondence they were admitted into that City and the King oblig'd to seek for shelter in the  Tower Margarete  of  Anjou  his Queen a Lady of an undaunted Courage having notwithstanding this found means to raise and put the King and her self at the Head of a formidable Army they sought for nothing more than to come to an Engagement The two Earls being no less eager for fighting they came to a Battle near  Northampton  Fortune declar'd for the Earls and the unfortunate King  Henry  was taken Prisoner  Notwithstanding this good Success the Duke of  York  finding matters not altogether to answer his Expectation was willing to come to an Accommodation with the captive King But the Queen more resolute and less tractable than the King her Spouse and not able to brook a Submission so little suitable to her Courage and the high Rank she bore in the World positively refused to come to  London  looking upon the Orders sent by the King as forced from him by his Enemies but instead thereof leaving no stone unturn'd to repair their Disgrace at last saw her self once more in a Condition to offer Battle to the Duke of  York  This Prince despising to be challeng'd by a Woman a Bloody Battle was fought wherein the Queen proving victorious caus'd the Heads of the Duke and the Earl of  Rutland  his Son slain in the Engagement to be put over the Gates of the City of  York  From thence she hastned to  London  to see the King and deliver him of his Imprisonment but receiving Intelligence that the Earls of  La Marche  and  Warwick  had carried him along with them and were at the Head of a good Army She Engag'd them with the first Opportunity obtain'd the Victory but enjoy'd not the Fruits thereof For the Earl of  La Marche  getting to  London  before her was there Proclaim'd King under the Name of  Edward  IV  Henry  and  Margarete  had no sooner Notice of this unexpected News but they assembled all their Troops and  Edward  fully resolv'd not to suffer them to approach  London  march'd with all possible Expedition in Conjunction with the Earl of  Warwick  towards  Tanton  There he gave Battle to  Henry  which lasted two days and cost the Lives of Men Victory at last declar'd for  Edward  who having now no more Enemies to encounter in the Field began to relish the Sweets of an agreeable Tranquility and took effectual Care to reward the Fidelity of his Friends  He was a Prince endu'd with all the Qualities requisite to make himself belov'd His high Birth and the Crown he wore had a less share in the Respect and Love his Subjects bore him than his goodly Air and great Qualifications He was very engaging sprightly of a sweet and tender disposition He was a little too much addicted to Gallantry so that his various Passions have sometimes been a Reproach to him However his Warlike Inclinations always had the better over his Love Passion for he prefer'd Martial Exploits to all other Considerations  It is easie to be guess'd at with what Demonstrations of Joy this Victorious Prince was receiv'd at  London  Among the rest of his faithful Servants was General  Talbot  Earl of  S  op  and this young  Monarch to reward his Services and to shew his Acknowledgment to all the World bestow'd not only vast Riches upon him but also honour'd him with his Confidence which made that General to be highly caress'd at Court  The Earl of  Devonshire  having at that time some Business of great Moment to transact at Court sought all possible Means of gaining General  Talbot  to his Interest which perhaps he would not have encompass'd at a very easie rate he being a Man of a blunt Conversation who aim'd at nothing more than to have the Reputation of a faithful Servant to his King and of a good Soldier But happening one Day to divert himself with walking in a Garden near  HamptonCourt  and meeting accidentally with the Countess of  Devonshire  he was surpriz'd and quite dazled with her Beauty and Charms As the Earl of  Anglesey  her Father had kept her very retir'd at his own House ever since she had been married for fear this growing young Beauty should produce some sinister Effects at Court so nothing but an Accident could have given an Opportunity to the General of seeing her  The General's Mind equally divided betwixt Love and Respect would not permit him to accost her so he contented himself with walking up and down in a certain Walk from whence he could see her Thus quite possess'd with the  Idea  of this Charming Lady he returns to  London  and so to Court The King was then playing at Cards with several Ladies attended by a great Number of Courtiers But the Earl of  Warwick  was got at some Distance from the rest in order to enter a certain  Memorandum  of Consequence to himself in his Table Book I told you before that the Earl of  Warwick  's Name was  Richard de Neville  but I did not tell you that being bred  up along with the King this Prince lov'd him beyond any of all his Favourites and in effect he had greater Obligations to him than to any other of all his Friends He was the Son of  Richard de Neville  Earl of  Salisbury  Lord Chancellor of  England  and  Alice  the only Daughter of  Thomas Montague  Earl of  Salisbury  Tho' but young at that time he was already a Widower his deceased Lady being  Anne  Sister to the Duke of  Warwick  The Earl whose History I am a going to give you was a Person so far surpassing in his Personal Merits Courage and Generosity all others at Court that he acquir'd the Sirname of  the Great  Never liv'd a Man in greater Affluence and Splendor nor ever did any one things with a better Grace than he He being so far from endeavouring to heap up Riches or to husband his Estate that he look'd upon Wealth as a thing not worth his Care Notwithstanding this Indifferency he was the Richest Lord in the Kingdom He had a Genius so far predominant above the common Rank of Men that even those who had a Prejudice against him and were ready at all Turns either to Contradict or at least not to Credit him no sooner heard him speak but like Inchanted Men were compell'd to agree to what he propos'd He was both beautiful and finely shap'd even to a Miracle His Magnificence and Gallantry which was natural to him made him both Lovely and Dangerous The King loving him both by Inclination and Gratitude had made him not only his Confident but also bestow'd the Greatest Places in the Kingdom upon him It may justly be said of him That nothing could have bin above him had he bin capable of applying his whole Mind to Business But his Inclinations for Love and a certain Notion he had fram'd to himself That even the highest Dignities  are purchas'd at too dear a Rate when upon that account we are forced to sacrifice the Pleasures of our Life made him sometimes stop in that Carreer wherein otherwise he might have carried every thing before him at Pleasure  This Character upon which I have perhaps enlarg'd a little too much has insensibly drawn me away from General  Talbot  He after having look'd a little while upon the Gamesters espying the Earl drew nearer and told him  You are too Gallant a Person for one to suppose you should write any thing else but some Verses or other to your Mistress And how happy are you My Lord to be able to make them  The Earl looking upon him said Smiling  What Is this General  Talbot  Has he got some Relish in the tender Effects produced by Poetry  He made no answer but lifting up his Eyes towards Heaven observ'd in the Earls Countenance all the marks of that Ironical and Malicious Air which he was blam'd for by some  Alas  cry'd the General  I intended to make you my Confident but you are not indulgent enough  The Word  Confident  rais'd in the Earl an extream Desire of being admitted into the Secret since by his Sighs and other passionate Motions he was sensible there was a Love Intreague in the case and he cou'd not but be highly pleased to see such a Savage Creature to be taken in the Snare of a Young Beauty  Don't be dismay'd  said he  at my Jocular way I can be serious upon Occasion I guess in part at your Thoughts You are in Love and you may assure your self you shall find in me the only Man in the World who is capable of giving you the best Advice 'Tis impossible  reply'd the General  I should be in Love in so small a time 'tis not above three Hours since I saw and that for the first time the Person that makes me thus sigh but my Lord  continued he  Oh How Beautiful is she  She has a noble Air without Affectation there was never a better Shape seen than Hers her Complexion the Colour of her Hair her Features to be short every thing is charming in Her I went to  HamptonCourt  to pay a Visit to the Duke of  Norfolk  who has bin ill for some days as I was taking a walk in a Garden I saw the Earl of  Devonshire  and his Lady doing the same he having desired me to serve him in a Business of his against one of my Friends I did all I cou'd to avoid meeting him as soon as I got sight of them and therefore turn'd off into a Bywalk where I thought I was secure from being seen but alas within a few Minutes I found him and the Countess sitting upon a Seat of Green Turfs for it being then very hot she was somewhat tired with walking The Colour of her Cheeks resembled two white Roses mix'd with an Incornation her Eyes carry'd along with them so bright a Lustre that I never beheld any thing like it in all my Life and to be short my Lord must I tell you over and over again that she appear'd to me a most ravishing Beauty You shall tell it me  reply'd the Earl  as often as you think fit for your own Satisfaction I am extreemly pleas'd to see you so Passionate for a Handsom Young Lady and fancy I shall see you before long work at your Needle as  Hercules  did with  Omphalis  Alas  said he  I am at a great Distance to see her as my  Omphalis  you will see an unfortunate Lover who is quite a Novice in the very Rudiments of that Art wherein you excel Don't talk of Ignorance  answer'd the Earl  'tis enough for a Man to Love to render him quickly capable of attaining to every thing required in Love and will you make me believe that you were never touch'd with any other Beauty before No  said he  I knew not what Love was I will declare it to you by all the most direful Imprecations that can be  He was actually a going to call Heaven and Earth to Witness when the Earl interrupting him said  I believe you my Lord I believe you I am convinc'd  you never was in Love before But pray let me know wherein I can serve you You can  said he  instruct me in what I must do to be belov'd because you understand it better then any other Man in the World To do this I should be acquainted with the Countess of  Devonshire reply'd the Earl  I should converse with her and be admitted into her secret Thoughts if I should serve you for a Guide whereas now you put me into a Foreign Country where I am ignorant both of the Language and Manners of the People so that as the Case stands I can scarce advise you to any thing but what must create new troubles to you  I had the satisfaction  reply'd the General  of meeting with a very favourable Reception her Husband as I told you standing in need of my Assistance which I will give him to the utmost of my Power but after all to please the Husband is not always an infallible Rule of pleasing his Spouse After all  said the Earl  it is a fair step in your Way and it often happens that those who please the Lady don't please the Husband as on the other hand all that please the Husband don't always please the Wife  He laugh'd very heartily at these expressions of the Earl of  Warwick  and said he  since you give me such Encouragement I am impatient to embark under the Conduct of so great a Master At the worst What Hazard am I likely to run The loss of a Liberty of what I ought to be weary long ago I know not  said the Earl  whether you are weary but this I am assured of you ought to be asham'd of it  They were so intent upon the matter that they did not perceive the King had left off playing who approaching nearer and overhearing the last Words ask'd them What it was the General ought to be asham'd of The Earl was a going to divert the King with telling the whole Story but that the General tipping the wink upon him to conceal it he told the King  That he was blaming  the General on account of his Indifferency and that he had made him an Offer to exchange with him some part of his Sensibility for the General's Insensibility  The King reply'd with a smile  He was oblig'd to the Earl since he lov'd the General so well as to be glad to see him engag'd in some Love Amusements  The Description the General had given of the Countess of  Devonshire  raised in the Earl of  Warwick  an extream Desire of being acquainted with her He had indeed seen her before but She being very young seldom appearing at Court and he at that time engaged with another Person her Charms had not made any impressions upon him it was no difficult matter for him to find out a plausible Pretence to make her a Visit He pitch'd upon a Day when he knew the Earl to be abroad a Hunting he pretended some certain Business and having contriv'd the matter accordingly he sent to know whether he might speak with the Countess about some Business that concern'd her Lord  She was then in a  Grotto  at the further End of her Garden and the Season being very hot He found her resting upon a Seat of Green Turfs in a Silk Night Gown of Rose Colour with Silver Flowers she appear'd very negligent and pensive The Countess of  Anglesey  her Mother sitting near her upon the same Seat Notwithstanding the Earl was sufficiently prepared for such an Interview by the Praises and Transports of General  Talbot  This did not hinder him for relishing that Excess of Pleasure which is commonly occasion'd by a Surprize of this nature His Eyes and Heart both agreeing in this point  That nothing in the World was Comparable for Beauty to Madam  Devonshire And in spite of all his Natural Boldness for which the Earl was reprehended by some and all his Contrivance to give a Specious  Pretence for this Visit he stood so amazed that without being able to utter one Word he did nothing but make his Bows to the Ladies considering all this while what to say without being able to find out where to begin  Another thing that puzled him was to find out a Place were to seat himself The Countess of  Anglesey  would have engag'd him to sit down next to her but judging he should not there have a full Sight of her fair Daughter he set himself down upon a large Marble kind of Bason which served for a Receiver of Water from another Vessel placed above it here having taken his Seat without reflecting upon what might happen he began to enter upon Compliments or to speak truly upon such extravagant bombast stuff that the Ladies did not know what to make of it However he went on in the same road till on a sudden finding himself cold and wet almost all over he stood altogether surpriz'd at this new Adventure You must know that the Master of the Waterworks seeing him under the  Grotto  had made all the haste he cou'd to make the Waters play which falling from the uppermost Vessel into that whereon he sat had wetted him to the very Skin his Surprize was such as to render him incapable of uttering one Word more and the Countess of  Devonshire  who not only look'd upon him but also hearkned to his Discourse with a great deal of Attention finding him Speechless thought no otherwise than that he had bin very ill  Give me leave  said she  my Lord to ask how you do  He was a going to tell her he did very badly which in effect was no more than the real Truth but was so much startled at the Question that he knew not what answer to return  Doubtless  said he to himself  she is sensible of what has happened but if I tell her I am wet to the Skin  she will laugh at me and if I remain sitting in this cursed place I shall be worse ridiculed by and by  Whilst he was thus arguing with himself he spoke not one word so that the Countess of  Anglesey  imagining no otherwise than that he had actually lost the use of his Tongue arose from her Seat and threw some water in his Face crying  My Lord Do you hear me Yes Madam  reply'd he bursting out a laughing at their Fancy  I both understand and see you very well and if I had bin ready to fall into a Swoon your Spring would have prevented it and so he arose all wet from head to foot backwards  The young Countess could not for bear bursting out into a loud laughter in spite of all the grave looks of her Mother and this Gayety of hers haing dispersed all the Earl's Splenetick Fancies and revived in him his natural Vivacity he entertain'd them with that Sprightliness of Wit they never had met with before in any other in all their Lives  The Condition he saw himself in not permitting him to stay with them as long as he cou'd have wish'd and remembring at the same time that the Countesses Husband was not to come home till after the next Day he only told them part of his pretended Errand desiring Leave at the same time to refer the rest to another Visit The Countess was willing enough not to refuse so indifferent a Favour to a Person of his Rank nevertheless she look'd upon her Mother before she would return an Answer and the Earl soon perceived that she staid for her Permission the Countess of  Anglesey  told him  They would look upon it as an Honour and they were too much concern'd at the accident that had beflan him not to be desirous to be forthwith inform'd of its Consequences I am afraid my Lord  said the Countess of  Devonshire you have taken Cold your Bath was not well managed  He took Leave of the Ladies and returning to the  place where he had left his Chariot his People were surprized to see him so wet not being able to guess at the reason of it  He was no sooner come home but he threw himself upon the Bed much less taken up with the Thoughts of his Health than of that lovely Lady he had left behind whose Idea had made so strong an Impression on his Mind that he fancy'd every moment to hear and see her he was turmoiling his Spirits with a thousand confused Thoughts which all tended rather to encrease than to cure his Evil but what most of all tormented him was that the Countess of  Anglesey  kept so watchful an Eye over her Daughter  What must I do  cry'd he  with this  Argus  'twill be impossible for me to find out as much as one favourable Moment to disclose my Heart to her  Sometimes he would flatter himself that if the Countess loved any thing at all it was not her Husband and that according to that rule the Husband was less to be dreaded than a Rival Lover but the more he thought of her the more his passion increased  His whole mind being insensibly taken up with these Considerations word was brought him that the King was arising from Supper so that without more ado he got up and went to wait on him he no sooner saw him but ordred him to follow him in his Closet where he made him read aloud certain Letters he had lately receiv'd from  France  whilst he was reading he ask'd because he seem'd to be bloated and much out of order  Whether he had bin Bathing himself  The Earl was not a little surpriz'd at this question but not imagining the King could know any thing of what had happened in the  Grotto  told him  That it being a Cold Evening he had taken Cold  The King smiled with a malicious Air and the Earl being much discomposed blush'd The King who  observ'd it laugh'd outright and the Earls Colour came more and more the King much pleas'd thereat  'Do you know  said he  that the Earl of  Devonshire  has begg'd of me to forbid you to Visit at his House He is not a little jealous since you have taken the liberty of Bathing your self before his Lady Ah Sir  cry'd he  if you are acquainted with my Adventure they have given you information of a thing of very slender Consequence How  reply'd the King  Do you think I am not very well pleas'd to know which way you dispose of your self In good earnest my Lord  added he after a few Minutes Silence  What is it you propose by visiting this fair Lady Have you any Business with Her Lord Yes Sir  reply'd the Earl  he was abroad a hunting and I had scarce one Moments Conversation with her You made your Addresses in a very Confused Speech  said the King  you were not sensible of what you said'  The Earl imagining that either the young Countess or her Mother had diverted themselves at his Cost found himself so touch'd thereat that he reply'd  'These Ladies were not surprizing enough to put me out of Order as your Majesty imagines I find nothing uncommon in their Persons I would not have you talk thus for your own Reputations sake  continued the King  since it will be much better your disorderly Addresses should be thought the Effect of a Surprize than of the Confusion of your Mind'  Being touch'd to the quick at these words he was meditating how to revenge himself upon the Ladies when the King continued  Is it possible you should be in Love with Madam  Devonshire  and take amiss her giving an account to her Husband of what pass'd in his absence I don't part with my Heart Sir at so easie a rate  replied the Earl  If the  Countess were much more Lovely than she is I would first be very well acquainted with her before I entred into such an Engagement The more you Know her the more you will Love her  cry'd the King sighing  Nature never framed any thing more compleat than her self She is one of her Miracles  These Words were utter'd by the King with such an air as surpriz'd the Earl to that degree that for want of Strength to support himself he lean'd against a Cabinet unperceiv'd by the King who being quite taken up with his own Thoughts took no Notice of the Confusion the Earl was in and he reading in the King's Face every thing that then pass'd in his mind said to himself  Is it possible that my Master should be my Rival and that he has bin so dextrous in concealing his Passion for the Countess that I have discover'd nothing of it hitherto  Whilst he was ruminating upon the odness of this Miracle for it is no less than a Miracle for a Sovereign to Love without Noise the King cast his Eyes upon him and with an air which would have appear'd most Charming and full of Goodness in any one else but a Rival told him  My Lord you are very dear to me I can't agree to your Destruction But look upon your self as lost if you fall in Love with the Countess I must withdraw my Favours from you and you will never obtain any from her That haughty Heart of hers disdains all Slaves below the Rank of Kings and I believe she would look with Scorn upon my own Brothers Sir  reply'd he  I am sensible as I ought to be of that charitable Care your Majesty is pleas'd to take to preserve me from suffering Shipwrack but I sincerely declare to you that hitherto I have been in no danger 'Tis possible that in time some Fatal hour or other might have constrain'd me to surrender my Heart to the Countess in spite of all my Reason against which what I have understood from your Majesty's own mouth  will serve as a full counterpoise I would not have you imagine  added the King  that I disclose to you only half my Heart I will give it you at full length and confess my frailties  'I was abroad a Hunting about  Windsor  for the few days I staid there most of the Gentlemen at Court being busy in rehearsing a Comedy with the Ladies at Court at my Mothers the Dutchesses Lodgings and you laying ill of a Feaver I had no other Attendance but those that were then in Waiting These being but few in number I lost their Company in the heat of the Chace'  'The Sun began already to deline the Sky became Cloudy the Air pretty cool and it Rain'd much I had Rid very hard was quite out of sight of the Hounds and heard the noise of the Hunting Horns at a considerable distance so that I thought it better to stay for their coming in a great Road than go in search of them I soon espy'd some Trees close and thick enough to keep the Rain from me so I alighted and sought there for shelter But scarce was I got well underneath the Trees when I heard a great outcry and saw a Woman whose Horse was running away with her and coming towards me I soon stop'd the Horse and casting my Eyes upon the Person I had saved out of danger I soon knew her to be the Countess of  Devonshire  trembling all over and looking so pale that believing she was very ill I lifted her in my Arms from on Horseback During the first Emotions she did not know me talking of nothing but Fear and Danger  Cease Madam to be afraid  said I  You are in a Place of Safety and I wish Heaven would afford me the same security it has been pleas'd to bestow upon you but I am already too sensible how difficult it is to secure ones self against  all these Evils which are inseperable from the Pleasure of seeing you  Whilst I was talking to her she had recover'd her self sufficiently to take notice of the freedom of my Conversation and casting her Eyes upon and knowing me  How Is it to you Sir  cry'd she arising from the place where she was seated  Is it to you I stand indebted to for my Life What words shall I make use of to shew you my acknowledgment If you will give me leave  said I  to tell you what words I desire you would make use of you will find them free from all Respect and Submission my Wishes are for something more uncommon and more tender  She Blush'd desiring leave not to tarry any longer so near me  What would the Earl of  Devonshire  think  said she  if he should find me with your Majesty alone in so solitary a Place He wou'd think me more happy than really I am  reply'd I  but he would not think me more sensibly touch'd with your Deserts and Beauty  '  'To speak the Truth  continued the King  I never met with any thing more Charming in all my Life Her Hair ty'd up in buckles play'd over her Shoulders she wore a Closebody'd Man's Coat which discover'd her whole Shape which you know is to a Miracle an Incornation Colour which succeeded that Paleness occasion'd by her Fear produc'd a mixture of Roses and Lillies and the contrary motions of Fear and the succeeding joy of being deliver'd by me as I flatter'd my self proved a signal addition to those Graces all the World allows her to be Mistress of To be short I look'd upon her with a satisfaction I am not able to express I would fain have detain'd her but was afraid of displeasing her because her Lord who was in the next Wood would doubtless go in search for her in all the Corners thereof But seeing her upon the point of remounting her Horse  Is it possible  said  I Madam you should be willing to expose your self to the same Danger you were in just now No Madam I must not suffer it and if it be so that you have Reason to avoid me I will rather depart notwithstanding the Violence I put upon my self in thus leaving you But pray promise to afford me some other few Minutes It would not be becoming to me Sir  reply'd she Modestly  to treat you with Indifferency Never was a Man in a greater Confusion than my self and whilst my Attendants were looking for me in every Corner I had a Thousand distracted Thoughts concerning what might become of the Countess No  said I  I can't plead in behalf of this imprudent Piece of Complaisance I have left her alone in the middle of the Forrest and that in such tempestuous Weather How Cruel was I to my self in letting slip so favourable an Opportunity of staying along with her If any Mischance should befal her how could I forgive my self It seems as if Fortune and Love had conspir'd to Conduct her to that solitary Place but I leave her without Trouble and thus lose a Jewel the Loss thereof I shall perhaps have Occasion to repent of all my Life time'  'After my return to  Windsor  I told them at Supper to require the Earl of  Devonshire  to send me his Hounds because having left at  London  my Pack of large Hounds I could not go a StagHunting I did not question but that he himself would come along with them to Court which he did accordingly and was receiv'd by me as the Husband of a Lady whom I loved and that to a high Degree As I was oblig'd to act with all possible Precaution in respect to the young Countess I ask'd him where he had bin the Night before and why he did  not go abroad with me a Hunting  He told me  That being not very well he went out in his Chariot but that his Wife being on Horseback was in the greatest Danger imaginable and ow'd her Life to a Peasant who had saved her'  'I did not spend much time with him but immediately went a Hunting and directed the Chace towards his  at with so much Eagerness that upon Sight thereof it seem'd to me as if it retreated backwards But not to give any Suspicion I in spite of all my impatience follow'd the Chace but with so much Uneasiness for fear the Stag should run at too great a Distance thence that every Moment I was ready to let fly at him Oh Love  said I  kill him with one of thy Darts shorten the Minutes that are to give me a Sight of the Countess thou can'st not do me a better piece of Service I pretended to be displeased with the Stagg's being run down so soon and the Earl inviting me to his House I gave him no Opportunity of reiterating his Request The Noise of the Hounds and Horns had brought this Young Lady into a terrass'd Walk that lay level with her own Apartment where she was walking with some of the Neighbouring Ladies and her Mother Sir  cry'd the Earl of  Warwick interrupting the King what brought her thither She is no great Lover of the Country  reply'd he  but the Earl of  Anglesey  was not very well That is to say  continued the Earl  with his Eyes lift up towards Heaven that every thing favour'd your Majesty's Design I must own it  added the King  For the Earl being altogether employ'd in ordering a magnificent Collation for my Entertainment afforded me an entire Liberty of entertaining the Countess'  'How uneasie have I bin upon your Account  said I  Alass Madam I feared every thing after the Danger I saw you undergo And how often have I reproach'd my self with that Complaisance I shew'd in thus abandoning you It was absolutely necessary it should be so for every body's Repose  answer'd she with a smile  your Majesty was not far off before My Lord  Devonshire  came to the Place he ask'd me by what Miracle I had escaped the Danger of a furious Horse  I told him as it happened  only Sir that instead of naming your Majesty I mentioned a Peasant who had saved my Life This Secret you were pleased to keep I accept off as a happy Omen  reply  'd  I  and I will flatter my self that in so doing you were willing to secure me against the Suspicion of your Overseers and it is impossible that since you would take Care of my Security in respect to them you should aim at my Destruction in regard to your self She blush'd at my Discovery of these flattering hopes  and said she  I was in perhaps the wrong to make a Mystery of so innocent a Matter but Sir Persons of my Age have so little Experience that it is a hard Task to act in every thing as it were to be wish'd Ah Madam  cry'd I  how cruel are these Reflexions of yours Don't rob me of all hopes on your side whilst on mine I am resolv'd to love you with so much Tenderness and so entire a Resignation as shall fully convince you of my Passion'  'She heard me all this while without speaking one Word but now lifting up her Eyes which she had kept stedfast to the Ground And what will the World say Sir  said she  when ever your Passion should take vent They would say that I was more happy in pleasing you then in possessing the Crown of  England  And  continued she  how  will this be relish'd by those who have an absolute Power over my Sentiments Let me manage that part with them  said I  Do you secure to me your Heart and I will secure you against all the World No Sir no  cry'd she  no Man living shall have my Heart except he unto whom of Right it belongs'  'I was so far engaged in Discourse with her that her Lord was within a few Paces only from us when she seeing him approach without being in the least discomposed spoke as if she had answered me  saying  I am much delighted with Hunting and go sometimes abroad upon Sport The Earl not imagining we were upon any other point desired me to enter a spacious Room where a Collation was ready at Hand contrived with so much Magnificence that I could have wish'd he had spar'd himself part of his pains But as I was almost distracted to see our Conversation thus interrupted I thought of nothing else than how to renew it This was no very easie Matter to do because the Earl of  Devonshire  was overdiligent in heaping his Civilities upon me I proposed to play with the Countess and took the  Spanish  Ambassadour who came along with me for our third Man because he understood no  English  The Earl told me his Wife being somewhat ignorant I should give him Leave to instruct her how to Play more quiet and better  But I told him  That was the right way to disoblige me since I could not bare any body should overlook the Game so he went to take a Walk with some of my Attendants'  'He was no sooner gone but I acted my part so well that having perswaded the  Spanish  Ambassadour I was weary of playing because some Disputes were made about the Cards I  was at Liberty to talk to the Countess and She to answer me without being perceiv'd by our third Person Alass  said I  My Charming Countess when you come back to  London  what will become of me unless I see you every day Oh I am afraid you will leave me and that will cost me my Life She smiled with a Childish Air not telling me what was to be done to see her without giving any occasion of disturbance as I was sensible was the thing that she dreaded most so the more I knew her Fear the more I strove to make her sensible also of the Impatience of a Man not accustomed to Obsticles of that Nature But all that I could say was not sufficient to alter her Resolution and if she told me nothing that was offensive she was very cautious in not saying any thing that was engaging so that with all my Application I could draw no more from her than Assurances of her Respect'  'I had ordred one of the Grooms of my BedChamber to dive into all the Circumstances of that Family which he did so successfully that having insinuated himself into the Acquaintance of a certain Old Lady who had bin Governess of the Countess he found her of so Covetous a Temper that in all Probability she would not withstand Liberality At last after having talk'd with my Lady  Devonshire  for a considerable time I left her but so prepossess'd with her high Deserts that though she would not in the least flatter me with hopes of Success I resolved to love her as long as I lived Her Lord attended me as far as  Windsor  I told him I intended to go a Stagg hunting the next Day and that he should not fail to go along with me and spent some part of the Night in ruminating upon what she had said and upon  what I had further to do to insinuate my self into her Favour'  'I did rise before the Sun to the Surprize of the whole Court and was abroad so early that the Earl of  Devonshire  came too late However he made haste to find me out and met with a kind Reception from me Under Pretence of talking of his Seat I took the Opportunity to enquire after his Lady She was Sir  said he  the Occasion of my not being sooner with your Majesty she is gone to  London  I knew not whether he took Notice of my Countenance but I am sure it changed most strangely however  he told me  that the Earl of  Anglesey  being ill when she came away from thence was now very desirous to have her near him because as he took Delight in nothing so he hop'd her Conversation might divert him I recover'd a little when I understood the Occasion of her journey which caused me so much Vexation But after having follow'd the Chace for a little while I clap'd Spurs to my Horse and taking a Byroad soon found my self alone I alighted and placing my self under the agreeable Shade of some Trees gave my self an entire Liberty of employing all my Thoughts upon the Countess What Pleasures  said I  did not I promise to my self And must one Moment rob me of what I love I have taken no Care either how to see her again or how to write to her And must I thus be separated from her I ought rather to have fain'd my self Sick to get an Opportunity of staying with her or ought to bring her back to  Windsor  under any Pretence whatever Alass What am I the better for my Soveraign Authority if I dare not make use of it I was then taking some Resolutions what to do for the future but these were soon gone when I considered they might  be displeasing to her Thus whilst I was strugling betwixt my Desires and Fear I saw my self fluctuating upon the Boistrous Waves of a Sea that is never without Storms all this while bewailing the Departure of my charming Countess 'Twas just then I heard the Noise of several Horses and the Voices of Women I should have had but little Curiosity to look after them but that coming so near me I arose to avoid them the first thing that offered it self to my Sight was my Lady  Devonshire  At that very Moment I felt all the Pleasure of an agreeable Surprise I run towards her and without asking whether she would alight nay without knowing what I proposed to do I took her in my Arms and set her upon the Ground But in a Moment after reflecting upon what I had done I began to be uneasie However it being too late to be recall'd I ask'd her Pardon conjuring her at the same time to let me know what unforeseen good Chance had brought her back  She told me  That the Axletree of her Chariot being broken by the Badness of the Road which required a day's time to be mended she had resolved to return from whence she came  I then told her  What a condition her Departure had put me into and that I had not left my Company upon any other account than to give my self over to my secret Thoughts and to bewail my self for having pass'd a Day without seeing her She seem'd to be touch'd with a thing which she could not very well doubt of seeing me in this Solitary Place where I could not be inform'd of the Mischance that had happen'd to her Chariot nor propose to meet with her at that time'  'Among the Women that were along with her I took Notice of  Albine  whereof I had had so lively  a Description that it was impossible for me to mistake her I had a great Inclination to have secured her into my Interest at that Instant But Great People Labour under this Misfortune That they can do nothing without being observed 'Twas also for this Reason that I would not detain the Countess so long as I could have wish'd I told her all that can be said or call'd  Tender  But could not discover in her any other Disposition than what I observ'd the day before so I was forced to hope for some happy Moment to see her in  London  In the mean while my Eyes follow'd her as far as they could I sent a thousand Sighs after her and then return'd where the Noise of the Hounds call'd me'  'The Earl of  Devonshire  being ignorant of what Mischance had befaln his Lady's Equipage I told it him and that I had met her upon the Road thinking that it might prove of worse Consequence to make a Mystery of it than to tell it as really it was But I found my self in the wrong the Earl acting here the part of a jealous Husband imputed to our own Contrivance the breaking of the Chariot and our meeting in the Forrest and without reflecting that we could not guess the illness of the Earl of  Anglesey  which they knew nothing of till after I left them he resolved to remove her at a good Distance from Court I did not guess at his Intention and soon put an end to the Chace He had no sooner taken his Leave from me but he ordered every thing to be got ready and unwilling to confide in any body but himself carry'd her away at Midnight so that the poor Lady saw her self exposed to those Reproaches she deserved not'  'So soon as I got notice thereof I return'd to Court and the Old  Albine  who had espoused  my Interest told me the Earl of  Devonshire  had desired my Lady  Anglesy  to observe her Daughter more narrowly for the future That we had had an Interview and that doubtless she had answer'd my Purpose This News pierced me to the very Heart I writ to her she sent me no Answer except that she pray'd me with all possible Violence to sacrifice my Impatience to her Honour Judge you  continued the King  to what a Degree I love her since till now I have kept this a Secret from you I hear News from her every Day and I shall certainly speak with her the first favourable Opportunity that offers 'Twas  Albine  that told me concerning the Visit you made her and that your appearing so much discomposed had rais'd in them a Suspition you were sent by me which would prove as unseasonable to me as to you Take my Word for it I will have neither Confident nor Rival love somewhere else and never visit my Countess again'  I have nothing to sacrifice  reply'd the Earl of  Warwick  who by this time having had sufficient Leisure to recollect himself and to consider of what he was to answer told him  Sir were the Young Countess as Beautiful in my Eyes as she appears to yours I would certainly never think of her any more as long as I live even if it should cost me my Life But 'tis not I that am subject to this Fatality 'tis General  Talbot  'tis true Sir he loves my Lady  Devonshire  with so excessive a Passion that whereever he finds you to stand in his way he will not be able to outlive his Pain I can't imagine what you tell me to be true  answer'd the King  Who has told you the General is in Love He who never was so before in his Life a Person the most cautious and indifferent of all Men living 'Tis a Secret he entrusted to me one Day when your Majesty drew unexpectedly near us  said the  Earl  and I intended to have given your Majesty the Diversion of understanding it at that time but that the General making a sign of keeping the Secret I began to talk concerning his Indifferency instead of his Passion  The King return'd no Answer his Heart being divided betwixt Love and Generosity He lov'd the General out of Gratitude but the charming Countess by Inclination such was his Confusion that to conceal it in some measure from the Earl whose over Curiosity he not much lik'd he left the Closet and went into the Dutchess of  York  his Mother's Apartment  The Earl came home overwhelm'd with a most profound Melancholy Never did a Man pass a Night with more Anxiety and Trouble  Cease Cease Ʋnfortunate Man  said he  to adore an inaccessible Beauty She is belov'd by thy Master who notwithstanding all his Greatness and Addresses has not as yet the least certainty of being beloved and what then must be thy Destiny if thou persists in so fatal a Passion 'Tis time to abandon it and to look upon this lovely Person as a dangerous Rock which will stave thy Vessel to Pieces  He had scarce taken this Resolution when retracting them as Frailties unbecoming his Courage and little suitable to that happy Temerity which had so often stood him in good stead  Is my Passion so weak  continued he  as to give way with so much ease to the Torrent that opposes its Progress Have not I taken notice of some favourable Looks in the Countesses Eyes I have no more to do than to persuade the King That if he continues to be a Rival to the General  Talbot  he will certainly die for Grief and at the same time to make Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  sensible of the Infidelity of our Monarch that she may endeavour to reclaim him  This was a Lady of Quality whose Family had bin Famous for being employ'd in the greatest  Places of the Kingdom In the Year  Richard de Lucy  Lord Justice of  England  was General of the King's Armies during the Civil Wars and ever since that time this Family being inseparably united to the House of  York  they were often out of Favour Upon the Accession of  Edward  to the Throne they signaliz'd themselves in their Affection for his Service This was the reason why all his Favourites but especially the Earl of  Warwick  cast their Eyes upon Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  to make her the King's Mistress which they did without much Difficulty This young Monarch as I told you before was the most Gallant Prince of his Age the best shap'd the bravest and most witty of all Men living  Elizabeth  on the other hand was considered as a Miracle of Beauty nothing was comparable to her Shape and her Wit alone was sufficient to have set off her Charms had they bin much inferior to hers 'Tis true she had a great Share of Pride and Haughtiness She look'd upon it as her Due to choose her Adorers out of the Royal Family and that without doing her a great piece of Injustice they could not wear any other Fetters but hers The King not able to refuse her his Heart at first visited her with much Circumspection on account of her Reputation but it was a hard matter considering the Ambition of the Lady and the Love of her Gallant to conceal a Secret of this Nature for any considerable time in short she was for having it out The King created her a Marchionness of  Heresord  which new Title as it procured her a great Court so it occasion'd no less Envy in others As now the King gave himself an entire Liberty of shewing his Gallantry and Passion to her so it was soon divulged every where and 'tis possible that this manner of loving so publickly took away the nicest and sweetest part of its Relish  But whatever it were he was most passionately in love with the Countess of  Devonshire  and had a most tender Concern for General  Talbot  when he understood his Passion for her He was most sensibly touch'd that it shou'd be He who was likely to cause him so much Pain and such was his Generosity that he would have sacrificed his Passion to him had it not bin beyond his Power so to do He check'd his Inclinations and was vex'd that his Heart would not join with his Reason in his Cure To allay in some measure his Pain he flattred himself that the Earl of  Warwick  whom he knew to be a bold and dextrous Person perhaps made use of the General instead of a Shield wherewith to shelter himself  For  said he  there is but little Reason to imagine that a Soldier who never had any Inclinations to Gallantry should now enter upon so mad a Project and that to so little purpose Ought he not to consider that he is not Master of any thing that may flatter him ever to be able to please the Countess of  Devonshire  She is one of the greatest Ladys in the Kingdom both for Estate and Birth nothing is comparable to her Wit and Beauty she is more narrowly watch'd than the  Golden Fleece  What is it then that can make him promise to himself such a Conquest 'Tis true he is a well made Person but he is none of the youngest Oh Doubtless 'tis  Warwick  himself that is the real Lover who thus thinks to put the change upon me  This Notion afforded him some present Consolation but to be secure of the Matter he resolv'd to try all Means of diving into the General's Sentiments  The Earl of  Warwick  having by this young Monarch's last Discourse to him understood that one of my Lady  Devonshire  's Women was not of a very difficult Access he judged he might engage her in his Interest by giving her greater Presents than the King had done looking upon this as the  most necessary Point for his Repose in hopes to interrupt the Correspondence by Letters betwixt his Master and the Countess and in lieu thereof to settle his own with her He took also a full Resolution not to mention one Word to the General of what he knew for Fear he should resign every thing to the King's Passion a piece of Generosity he look'd upon as not very suitable to his present Design He went early to wait on the King and spent the rest of the Day in the Apartment of the Marchioness of  Hereford  but could not meet with an Opportunity to tell her she had a most dangerous Rival as it was absolutely necessary to set her to work to prevent the King's engaging any further in this new Passion and being uncertain when he might have a favourable time to entertain her he ventur'd to write to her these Lines  MADAM  IT has not bin my Fault that I am not now in a Condition to save you the Trouble of knowing that the King is unfaithful I have bin so bold as to represent to him what Regard he ought to have to his Oaths and how much he was in the wrong to prefer the Countess of  Devonshire  to you since her Charms are so much inferiour to yours What is to be said in the Matter  Madam  Love is blind and the King is apt to believe that my Inclinations to support your Interest makes me careless of his Thus my Councels become suspected nothing but your Reproaches will be able to bring him back to you If that proves unsuccessful I advise you to tell him that you will make such a Noise of it as will sufficiently revenge your Wrong Don't be negligent in the Matter  Madam  but above all don't sacrifice  me since you have not any one Friend more devoted to you than my self  Elizabeth de Lucy  had bin sensible her self that the King had not the same Passion for her but his Intreague with the Countess of  Devonshire  had bin carry'd on with so much Secresy that in spite of all her Endeavours she had not bin able to learn any thing of it This Letter of the Earl of  Warwick  's all at once unravel'd those Points which had occasion'd to her of late a thousand Torments tho' in effect her Case was not much amended by it Being naturally of a fierce Temper she had muchado to choose the milder Way But as she had never as yet had any Contest with the King so she like a cunning Woman rightly judged it more proper for her to try the King's Temper before she discover'd her own so she retired into her Closet for Fear of discovering her Sentiments to those that were then making their Court to her  As for the Earl of  Warwick  he had had so little Rest that being seized with a violent Pain in the Head he was not able to rise and therefore gave Orders that he would see no Body Soon after in comes the General  Talbot  and his Servants believing that a Person of his Character was excepted from their Masters Orders they let him go in The General appear'd to be beyond his Wits at the Earl's Indisposition which perhaps at another Juncture he would not have bin but now look'd upon him as his faithful Guide who was to conduct him through a Country where he as yet was unacquainted with the Roads Since that time I saw you last my Lord  said he  I have met with a world of Adventures and you will be perhaps surpris'd as well as my self how dextrously I got over them I never thought Love cou'd have made me  so Cunning and Designing and yet you will be oblig'd to own that it has Go on my Lord as long as you think fit  said the Earl  I can much better hear than answer you  As I was last Night making my Court to the King  said the General  I found him busy in looking upon some Pictures painted upon Glass He call'd me as soon as he saw me Have you any Skill  said he  in this kind of Workmanship I drew nearer and told him that the Light of the Candles was not very proper to make one see the true Perfections or Defects of the Painting These are only Copies  reply'd the King  so there can be no great Loss in them but among all the rest I have a peculiar Fancy for this  said he  shewing me the Picture of my Lady  Devonshire  The Seller knows not whose it is without he goes to the  Italian  Painter to enquire for whom he sells them I have too lively an  Idea  of that lovely Person  continued the General  not to know the Picture which cast me into such a Confusion that I could scarce recover my self the King's Curiosity made me tremble so I was very careful not to name her and told him doubtless it was some Foreigner Why  reply'd the King  Would you not have her to be an  English  Lady It seems to me  added I  that she being so exceeding handsome she must have appear'd somewhere or other I assure you  continued he  I have some confused Remembrance to have seen her somewhere or other Perhaps in  France  or  Holland said I  but for the most part Picturedrawers draw their Pictures according to their own Fancies such as bare some Resemblance to every Body The King made no Answer but fixing his Eyes upon the Picture seem'd to be in a deep study and so was I How unfortunate am I  said I  if I should have  such a Rival A King so lovely in his Person is more likely to be accepted of than I Is it possible he should so soon leave his Mistress  The Earl of  Warwick  did within himself admire the Oddness of this Adventure how General  Talbot  should just come to the King when this Pourtraiture of the Countess of  Devonshire  was brought to him He could not immediately satisfy himself what made the King pretend he did not know her since some of those that attended his Person at  Windsor  knew he had bin treated with a Collation at her House But he concluded at last that the General knowing nothing of that Matter the King did it to be satisfy'd concerning what he had told him of that General's Passion Whilst he was ruminating upon all these Matters the General being amazed to see him so surprized What is the matter my Lord  said he  Won't you speak to me I told you before  reply'd the Earl  I was not fit for Company I am satisfy'd  added the General  provided you will tell me only what makes you to be so much surprized at what I tell you The reason is  reply'd the Earl    having recover'd himself a little  because it seems very odd to me how any one cou'd offer the Picture of the Countess to sale since considering how narrowly she is observ'd I most question whether they would suffer her Picture to be drawn Be that as it will  answer'd he  the King bought the Pourtraiture and charg'd me to carry it into his little Closet where he intended to keep it like a Jewel of great Value Had he taken the least notice of my Countenance he might easily have discover'd the Disorder I was in As I heard him give his orders to bring the Limner who had made that Piece to him I did not question but that he intended to enquire after the Name  of this Fair Lady There needed no more to make me rise early in the Morning I went to the Picturedrawer and having gain'd him into my Interest by a very large Present and bought the Original whereof the King has only the Copy to tell his Majesty That this Piece was drawn for the Fair  Rosamond  the Daughter of the Earl of  Clifford  the Famous Mistress of King  Henry  II of  England  and that tho' the Drapery was somewhat too Modern for those Times he should tell him He thought fit to dress her according to the Mode that it might sell the better To be short by the help of my Instructions he answer'd all the young Monarch's Questions to a Miracle whereof I was a Witness with an Intention to help him out upon occasion The King would tell me several times Truly  Rosamond  was a lovely Lady I don't wonder that King  Henry  would never forgive his Wife the Murder of so Charming a Creature Queen  Eleonore  reply'd I look'd upon her with a Jealous Eye Yes  said the King  But as for my self I admire her see what Difference there is betwixt our Sentiments I made scarce any Answer to this being afraid lest if I shou'd put  Rosamond  too far in his Head he might thereby find out the way to the Beautiful Countess of  Devonshire  so I endeavour'd to divert him from these Thoughts by proposing a Match at Tennis betwixt him and the Duke of  Gloucester  My only Comfort is  continu'd he  That he thinks no further than  Rosamond  and that the Countess of  Anglesy  who is very sensible of her Daughter's Beauty and what Impression it might make upon a young Prince so much inclined to Tenderness does keep her up very close without suffering her to come to Court and that upon that Score she makes all the World believe she is most frequently indisposed  But  continu'd he  as for my own Concern I know how to manage the Matter and intend to enter into a strict Friendship with the Earl of  Devonshire  I told you before that he stands in need of my Assistance in a Business of great Consequence wherein if I should oppose I might turn the Ballance on which side I please 'Tis this that has made him entertain me with all imaginable Civilities and when I went to visit him he entreated me to visit his Lady in her Apartment I must confess to you That her Charming Wit accomplish'd what the Charms of her Person had begun before I was so far beyond my self and so bewitch'd that nothing less than her Husband's Presence could have hinder'd me from declaring my Love upon the Spot However I check'd my Sighs but with so much Violence that I was in Danger of being choak'd Certainly never did a Man of my Age undergo so hard a Novitiat Alas I am no more surpriz'd now that Love should even exert its Vigour among the Tygers and Bears You may judge now if I should be condemned to a much longer Silence whether I would not immediately prefer Death to Life and at the same time it is no easie Task for me to get an Opportunity of speaking to her unless you will do me the Favour to go along with me and entertain the Earl whilst I do the same to the Countess  This offer was too pleasing to the Earl of  Warwick  to refuse it for he had made several Trials of seeing her again and went at divers times to pay her a Visit but my Lady  Anglesey  who was an Experienc'd Overseer had taken such measures that setting aside his first Visit when to speak the Truth she surpriz'd them she had always some Excuse or other at hand to send him away handsomely so that when the General who had got  a great Ascendant in that Family desired him to go along with him he was highly pleas'd with it The Person he was to act in amusing the Duke of  Devonshire  was indeed not altogether suitable to his Wish but he would certainly have gone under much worse Conditions flattering himself that at least he might by Intervals say somthing or other that would abundantly recompence his Labour  The General took him in his Coach because the Earl's Livery should make no shew at the Door and for the same reason they took none of their Servants along with them so that coming to the Gate my Lady  Devonshire  thought she should see no body but the General and tho' my Lord was then abroad her Mother and she looking upon him as no dangerous Person admitted him without any further Ceremony The Earl of  Warwick  was too nearly concern'd not to take particular notice in what manner his Reception should be made he found them nettled at his Presence they both shew'd him a great deal of Civility but the young Countess would scarce lift up her Eyes to look upon him and if she hapned to look at her Mother she cast down immediately her Eyes again towards the Ground and chang'd Colour There is not the least question but that the Sprightliness she shewed in his first Visit being not approved of by my Lady  Anglesey  she had given her perhaps a Lesson upon that Account which proved not very favourable on his side so that he found himself under no small Uneasiness but the Pleasure he felt of beholding so Lovely and so Extraordinary a Person soon got the better of that Veneration which was occasion'd by the serious Looks of the Countess  The General  Talbot  was not a little vex'd also to meet with my Lady  Anglesey  in her Daughter's Apartment but resolving to make the best however of the Earl of  Devonshire  's Absence he told them at his first coming into the Room That he was come to entertain them with an Affair of Moment and being placed next to the Countess of  Anglesey  he judged he could do no less than enter upon something that might Divert and make some favourable Impression upon them The main Subject of his Discourse was such as he lov'd to speak of most As for Instance The Famous Siege of  Orleans  wherein he was so much concern'd in conjunction with the Earl of  Salisbury  where the Maid of  Orleans  began to signalize her self in so miraculous a manner as also in the Battel of  Patay  where the Earl of  Suffolk  lost the Day The General did here Wonders and they were both taken Prisoners by this Heroine Neither did the General forget to enlarge upon the taking of  Roan  by the Count  de Dunois  for it was he who together with the Duke of  Somerset  did most bravely defend that Place and who was deliver'd up as an Hostage for the Payment of Crowns of Gold but the  English  would rather have Mortgaged half the Kingdom than left him in the Lurch whom they knew to be one of their best Generals and whom they commonly used to stile  The English Achilles  These being all matters sufficiently known and the Countess of  Anglesey  was better acquainted with them than most People being a Lady of great Sense and of an Eminent Rank at Court however she would not interrupt him and as he was very apt to speak very passionately of a thing wherein he had acted so Great and Noble a Part and that the Presence of the Countess of  Devonshire  had raised in him an extraordinary Vivivacity  he would sometimes talk so loud that the Countess of  Anglesey  who set next to him was not a little disturb'd with the Noise  The Earl of  Warwick  was sure to improve these Happy Moments in saying now and then some engaging thing or other with a low Voice to the Countess and therefore under Pretence that he us'd to chaw Tobacco held his Handkerchief before his Mouth for fear her Mother should suspect something of the matter He told her He Adored her That he desired nothing else in return but her Permission to serve her with the same Respect as they do the God's and That he hop'd his unfeign'd and dissinteressed Passion deserved something of her Goodness She pretended not to mind him but understood very well all he said and the Earl was so much taken up with whispering that the Countess of  Anglesey  spoke more than once to him without receiving the least Answer Her Daughter was much concern'd thereat and tho' perhaps she was not displeas'd with what he told her she would have bin very sorry to see the Mystery unravell'd What prov'd an additional Satisfaction to the Earl was when he consider'd that he had thus bubbled both the Mother and the General and thereby had got sufficient Opportunity of declaring his Passion Their Visit was so long that it exceeded all the Bounds of your ordinary Visits The Earl of  Devonshire  did not come home nevertheless they made no Motions as if they intended to go at last my Lady  Anglesey  told them not without some Marks of Uneasiness It was very late and perhaps her Soninlaw would Sup in the City At these Words they arose and went their ways  The General vex'd to the Heart at the Ill Success of this Visit was ready to quarrel with the Earl on  account of his sitting next the young Countess alledging That since he lov'd her no Body else ought to pretend to that Place but this Ill Humour was so far from displeasing his Rival that he was highly delighted with it  My Lord of  Warwick  having discover'd fresh Charms in the Countess both in reference to her Wit and Person was afflicted to the Heart at the thoughts of her so Dreadful Overseer meaning her Mother and as he saw no Means how to be rid of her  Alas  cry'd he  Alas Is this the Prospect of my approaching Happiness I am afraid I shall be expos'd to abundance of Trouble without the least certainty of being recompenc'd according to my Desires  He was not only perplex'd with his own Misfortune but also forc'd to bear his full share in that of the General He came to awaken him at Day break to tell him several things which would have prov'd but very indifferent Entertainment to him had it not bin for the Name of the Countess which being often intermingled in his Discourse did somewhat allay his Ill Humour The General had not bin able to hit another Opportunity to give her a Visit because the Earl of  Devonshire  understanding how long they had staid for his coming home had made him several Visits one after another and as the General was not very happy at contriving Love Intreagues so whatever pains he took to find out a specious Pretence his Stock was quite exhausted so that he came to the Earl's in a very bad Humour I am almost desperate  said he to him  The Earl of  Devonshire  has bin so often with me that we have nothing more to say to one another I have settled his Business much more to his Advantage than he could have done himself and thereby have dealt unjustly with one of my best Friends and after all I don't find all this to be look'd upon as deserving any thing  at this Jealous Fellow's Hands I have a great mind  said he frowningly  to pick a Quarrel with him For What Benefit do I reap from the Obligations he owes me I see his Lady no more and I protest to you I am ready to be choak'd and this forc'd Silence makes me lose every thing that might be pleasing to her To embroil your self with him  said the Earl  would be a very odd Method to hope for a favourable Reception from her But you being better acquainted with him than I let us pretend That we have heard he has a mind to sell his fine Seat near  Windsor  and that I am willing to purchase it let us go to see him together and if he is at home you shall amuse him in Discourse whilst I will talk to the Countess and prepare her to give you a favourable Reception if he be abroad you may lay hold of this Opportunity your self  The General highly satisfied with this Expedient embrac'd it with all his Heart So they sent to the Earl of  Devonshire  to know whether he were at Home and were told he was not This happening much to their Wish they went thither immediately but found him come home This News put them almost in to Dispair the Coach being already within the Gates of the Courtyard instead of alighting they began to consult what was best to be done one was for going straightways into the Countess of  Devonshire  's Apartment the other was for going back without seeing any Body whilst they were thus disputing the Countesses People look'd at them out of the Windows At last the Earl of  Warwick  so far prevail'd with the General that he was to alight alone and make a short Visit but mention not one Word concerning the Countryseat The matter was perform'd exactly as they had agreed together the General staid but a very short time with the Earl of  Devonshire  which seem'd to him a Year and then came back to his Coach almost like a Madman I am almost reduc'd to Dispair  said he to the Earl  I meet with insurmountable Obstacles in my Way Were they made on purpose to plague me above all other Men I have always heard them talk of Love as of a Secret Passion full of Pleasure without any considerable Intermixture of Pain I thought it was sufficient to Love to be belov'd again to declare ones Love and to have the Liberty of taking a Walk together I have known a Thousand who courted their Mistresses without much Difficulty and a Thousand Mistresses that were not known but by the Name and Merits of their Lovers but in my Case every thing is very different I meet every where Dragons in my Way whom I am forc'd to Combat I could not speak to her I adore and my Patience is put to the hardest Tryal that ever was I have done my Lord I am quite tired of this way of Living so far different from what I was us'd to till now I am resolv'd to think of nothing but the recovery of my Liberty this shall be my only Mistress for the future and I am strangely mistaken if ever I part from her again  He would have continued talking with the same Violence all the remainder of the Day had they at their coming to Court not immediately espi'd the King The Earl of  Warwick  quite tired with the General's Complaints and his own Vexation for not having bin able to see the Countess made all the hast he could to approach his Majesty who seeing him alight out of his Coach ask'd him soon after with a low Voice From whence do you come Sir  reply'd the Earl  your Majesty may easily guess since you see me with the General I understand you  said he  But you are in the Wrong not to endeavour to cure  him of his Passion I know you are Malicious enough to encourage his Love by some Flattering Hopes or other There is no great occasion for that  said the Earl laughing  he is apt enough to indulge himself in what he thinks a Pleasure to him  Whilst they were thus talking the King entring into his Closet  told him  I could not have believed the General would have Embark'd on so weak a Bottom especially at such an Age as his and therefore the other day having a Mind to be satisfy'd in that point it succeeded according to my Wish For I had the Picture of the Countess of  Devonshire  Drawn without her Knowledge which the PictureDrawer pursuant to my instructions sent to me to be Sold The General happening to see it was much discomposed but what pleased me best was that he did all he could to deceive me The next day he went to the Limner unto whom he gave a good Summ of Money charging him to make me believe it was drawn for  Rosamond  King  Henry  II Mistress who has bin dead above years ago I can't forbear laughing when I consider how pleased he was when he believed me to be so easily imposed upon and I have now no more reason to doubt that it was his Interest that made him Conceal my Lady  Devonshire  from me I know all that your Majesty has told me  said the Earl  The General Proud of having Acted so nice a Part came on purpose to tell it me in hopes of being Applauded for his Conduct and for my part I was not backwards to shew my self a Man of Complaisance He will be obliged to you for it as long as he lives  reply'd the King  But you came from the Countesses Pray what News there She was invisible to us  reply'd the Earl  She did not appear but her Husband did The General was  ready to Quarrel with him because he had so little Breeding to be at Home when he thought he had bin abroad  The King return'd no answer to the Earl but after pondering a little upon the Matter  at last told him  You see how all my Mirth is changed at once into Sadness I am uneasie at what the General is likely to suffer when he comes to be acquainted with the Intreague betwixt the Countess of  Devonshire  and I Then you are happy Sir  cry'd the Earl  No hitherto I live only on Hopes  reply'd he  and were it not for  Albine  who gives me some Comfort I would certainly act aboveboard with my Mistress For what is it I have to fear and after all how do I know whether her Governess does not deceive me Your Majesty is above all this  said the Earl  But consider whether it be not the hight of Pleasure to a Heart sensible of the Nicities so Love to know that you are perhaps the only Monarch in the World whose Love is unreveal'd Yes  answer'd the King  I should extreamly delight in it and relish this kind of Mystery in its utmost perfection were I happy But let us change the Theme I am perhaps the only Monarch who has Patience enough to Sigh so long without knowing more of his Destiny than I do I suffer my self to be guided by an Old Woman I am afraid of disobliging the Countess and suffer a great deal in hopes of one happy day  'Tis true added he  This day is not far off for I am to send the Earls of  Anglesey  and  Devonshire  to  York  though under a slender pretence their Business being to inform themselves concerning some differences arose in those parts whereof they are to give me an account Probably your Majesty  said the Earl  will visit the Countess without any further Precaution so soon as they are gone I see only one Obstacle in the way that is my Lady  Anglesey  who keeps a very watchful Eye over her Daughter but we must give her a Dose of  Opium  You divert your self at your own Pleasure  reply'd the King  you may be assured I am not acquainted with the Temper of that Old Dragon but I have contrived the Matter thus with  Albine  The same Night I have sent the Father and Husband to  York  I am to come to a little Gate leading into the Garden and in disguise and so must you How Sir  said the Earl  will your Majesty take me for your Companion perhaps to divert the good Old Governess Much thereabouts  said the King  For you must knock at the Great Gate in disguise and ask to speak with her so soon as she comes to you you are to tell her your Nephew has kill'd a Gentleman in a Duel they are in search after him he is hard by and desire you would shelter him here only for one Night He intends to go aboard a Ship before daylight and you will Conduct him safely into the  Netherlands  Hereupon the Old Woman is to run Mumbling to the Countess of  Anglesey  to beg her to suffer her Nephew to come into the House and if she can get the Key of the little Gate I am to go up by a Private Pair of Stairs to the Countesses Apartment But supposing her Mother should refuse to let you come in Sir what will you do then  said the Earl  O she certainly will for she loves  Albine  and will certainly pity her Case  The King having spoken these Words went immediately into his BedChamber and the Earl to his House but so pierced with Pain and Vexation that he threw himself upon his Bed accusing his ill Destiny and upbraiding himself for having delay'd so long to bring over  Albine  into his Interest He could likewise not guess at the cause of Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  's Silence  all which joyn'd together made him imagine himself the most Unfortunate of any Man Living I shall never know  cry'd he  the utmost extent of my Disgrace 'Tis my Master that is the cause thereof who has pitch'd upon me for his Confident and will have me go along with him to a Place where I am not able to see him without dying upon the Spot What must I leave him at the Countesses after I have taken all the Pains that possibly I can to get him Admittance I would sooner throw my self into the  Thames  But after all won't it be better to be there present because I flatter my self that some Accident or other may thwart the happy success of this Interview Thus the Earl Tormented himself sometimes sitting sometimes arising but all this while so overwhelm'd and entangled in Grief that he knew not what Resolution to take His Great Mind not used to Buckle was not so much afflicted with having the King for his Rival as with the Tenderness he supposed the Countess had for this Young Monarch O your Beautiful Eyes  cry'd he  What was it you would fain have told me at the very first time I saw you What did you mean the other day by those piercing Darts so full of Sprightliness and Tenderness Oh why would not you cast your angry looks upon me when I told you that it was you alone I adored I should be apt to believe  continued he  that she hearkned to me for no other reason than to Sacrifice me to the King and to tell him the wole Matter but she has kept the Secret Tohwhat purpose is all this Mysterious Contrivance What can be the reason she should be Careful of me of one side when she Stabs me on the other And supposing I should bring over  Albine  to my Interest what Benefit shall I Reap by it since  her Mistress loving the King so well as she does she will find out means to see him in Private Thus he pass'd half the Night without coming to any fix'd Resolution when on a sudden something came into his Head that afforded him some fresh Hopes and a little Comfort He look'd upon the Success thereof as a kind of a Miracle which might produce a considerable change in his present afflicted Condition and his Heart which seldom used to despair was willing to flatter it self with good Success  So without troubling himself for the present with the Concerns of the Family of my Lady  Devonshire  he did not oppose the going of the Father and Husband to  York  but immediately went to see Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  How Madam  said he  since you have thought fit to Sacrifice your Reputation in passing for the King's Mistress will you suffer with Patience to see him snatch'd away from you Your Conquest will be attended with nothing but Shame at this rate 'Tis this Night Madam That is to decide your Fate The King has not bin able hitherto to entertain the Countess of  Devonshire  in Private but now every thing is prepared for his secret entrance there Will you let this go on with the same Tranquility wherewith you have neglected my first Council My Lord  said she  I have not bin insensible of the Misfortune that threatned me I flatter'd my self that my Dissatisfaction and my Tenderness might efface my Rival out of that Heart whereof I once had the absolute Possession I staid for some favourable opportunity of disclosing my self to the King But since the Case is so pressing I must send to desire him to make me a Visit that I might load him with Reproaches That I may Cry and that I may Threaten I  will kill my self before his Face if he leaves me Nothing can be better Madam  said the Earl  but I beg you let me but see you Act one Part of this Comedy that either I may Applaud or Correct you for you know I am a Critick at Plays No no my Lord  cry'd she  This is no matter of diversion to me I never was so much Concern'd at any thing in all my Life But  said she after having paused a while  I know not how the King came to the Knowledge of the Countess nor how it came to pass that she lov'd him so you must instruct me in this Point The Earl approving her Proposition gave her an account of his Hunting at  Windsor  and at the same time charg'd her not to mention any thing of this Evening's Meeting because the King would certainly charge him with the discovery thereof having Communicated the Secret to no body else but himself  There was no great occasion for the Earl of  Warwick  to encourage Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  she was too nearly concerned in the Matter not to make use of all her Arms and she resolv'd to take all the advantages she could Her Nght Gown was of Gold and Blue Silk Trimm'd at the Edges with precious Stones Her Head was carelesly dress'd without hiding the Lustre of her Coalblack Hair She wore the King's Picture on one of her Arms and in short consulted her Looking Glass so well that she had never appear'd more Beautiful in all her Life Having sent a Messenger to the King to desire him to make her a Visit He did not fail to come accordingly for no Man could have paid her more Respect than he did and notwithstanding his new Passion she had an almost uncontroulable Ascendant over him He was not a little disturb'd at the earnest Message she sent him and turning towards the Earl of  Warwick  What  does she want with me  said he  can't you guess Sir  answered the Earl  my Guess is That she that is a Mistress of so Young and Handsome a King as you are does desire nothing more than to see him to please him and to take care of a Heart in the Possession whereof consists the Felicity of her Life For the rest I can't tell whether she has any other Business which has obliged her to send this Compliment to your Majesty I will go thither and pass away half an hour  said the King  for I am resolved that nothing shall come in my way to hinder this Nights Appointment The Earl being highly dissatisfy'd at these Words to detain the King the longer put him in mind that he had promised to give Audience to the  Spanish  Ambassadour who was ready to come to Court and that he had better to pay his Visit to the Young  Elizabeth  after the Audience was over  Accordingly the King delay'd his Visit but no sooner was the Ambassador gone but he went to his Mistress whom he found Singing in a Melancholly Tone So soon as she saw the King she left off but the King desir'd her to go on  As the Swan  said she  near the Banks of the River  Semander  bemoans his Death by his last Song so I foretell mine this day yes Sir I foretell it and reproach you with being the Cause thereof  He Blush'd at these Words and gave her a Tender look What is it said he you mean to reproach me thus undeservedly She then laid open the Matter to him with Tears in her Eyes The King surpriz'd to see her so well acquainted with the whole Matter stood it out nevertheless most Boldly  telling her  That nothing in the World was more False That he had never seen the Countess of  Devonshire  except for one Moment at her own House whilst he was at  Windsor  and that ever since that time he had not so  much as ever thought of her That if it were true that he had bin so far struck with her Beauty as she imagin'd it would perhaps not have proved impossible for him to have seen her again But his Opinion was that some Body or other had contrived to make her kill her self with her own Weapons because they knew he was a declared Enemy against such like Inquisitive Practices The Marchioness touch'd to the Heart to see him stand it out so stifly to conceal his Infidelity began to be in a most Furious Rage and would not suffer him to stir out of the Room and so soon as he began to talk of going made most doleful Lamentations and Outcry's declaring she would kill her self before his Face As he knew very well that my Lord  Anglesey  's and  Devonshire  's Journey would take up some days he considered that there would be no great difference in his Enjoyment if he deferr'd to see the Countess of  Devonshire  till the next Night so that he did not part with Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  till very late which appeas'd her Anger a little for the present and the Earl of  Warwick  very inquisitive after every thing that was Transacted there understanding that the King had ordered his Supper to be served up there did not question but that the Neck of the other Intreague was broken at least for that Night  Upon this surmize he disguises himself as much as possible he could and taking along with him Mr  Berincour  one of his Gentlemen who for a considerable time past had bin his Confident in his Nocturnal Rambles tells him the whole Concern and so trusting to his good Fortune away he goes to the little Gate of the Garden of the Countess of  Anglesey  and immediately sends  Berincour  to speak to  Albine  The Action he was upon was so full of Temerity that he himself durst  not make a due Reflection upon the danger that might attend it He was to deceive the Young Countess in Personating the King when at the same time he knew not the Place of their Appointment and whether it were to be by the light or in the dark He could not but dread every thing from his Master if the thing should come to his Knowledge Besides a Thousand unforeseen Accidents as dangerous in their Consequences as any of the rest But his Natural Intrepidity and his Love making him consider all these Dangers for no other end than to outbrave them he went on as fast as he could without hesitating upon the Matter So soon as he was come near the Garden he stopt a little to stay for  Berincour  's return from  Albine  who had managed every thing with so much Dexterity that the Earl heard her coming much sooner than he could or durst have expected and turning a Key a Thousand times in the Lock without being able to unlock it  Albine  never made use of that Key and now was so much discomposed at this Accident that she did not know what to do all the Pains she took to open the Lock proving to no purpose she at last broke it She was then forced to tell him through a Cranny of the Door that it was impossible for her to open it being in the dark and not daring to fetch a light And that for this time she knew not what could further be done The Earl almost reduced to Dispair considering that in case he lost this Opportunity he could not meet with another so suitable to his Purpose since the King's coming in Person would soon unfold the riddle and understanding what had happened would bear him as much ill will as if he actually entertain'd the Countess  He was very Tall and Large the Wall was none of the highest and he had observed that day  when he found my Lady  Devonshire  in the  Grotto  that there were some Nails fastned into it so he got upon the Shoulders of his Gentleman who being none of the least he scrambled over the Top of the Wall though not without a good many scratches He no sooner got into the Garden but he emptied his Pockets that were full of Gold desiring  Albine  with a Gentile Air to keep them for him She believing him to be the King was very ready to accept them though at the same time she was under no small apprehension lest this Intrigue if discovered might prove fatal to some body or other and upon that score was so far overwhelm'd with Thoughts that had she seen the Earl she would scarce have known him He went along with her to a Private pair of Stairs when the Old Gentlewoman remaining below told him  He would find my Lady  Devonshire  in a Room above  He was considering with himself how to justifie this Treachery against the King and her self when approaching to a Door some body took him by the Hand he follow'd softly into a Chamber where without giving him leisure to speak he was told  What will you think of me my Lord I dare not as much as ask it The Steps I now make ought to appear to you so Criminal that I am perhaps upon the point of losing all that Esteem you gave me such assurances of when you came hither along with the General  Talbot The Earl of  Warwick  was surprized to such a degree at what he heard as to remain under the greatest uncertainty what answer to give  By what Accident  said he  should this Person know that I am not the King For though she does not see me she is too well inform'd of the whole Matter thus to mistake me Is this a Snare wherein to catch me Am I with my Charming Countess or with some body else that intends to Trap me  He had not much time to consider  of his present Circumstances because the Lady expected his Answer in order to continue their Conversation  I am so far confounded at this Excess of my good Fortune  said he to her  that instead of entertaining any Thoughts that might be injurious to you I find my Tenderness and Acknowledgment encreased to such a degree as is impossible to be express'd However Madam in the midst of all my Happiness I must confess to you that I want the Pleasure of seeing you which I beg of you to afford me With all my Heart  reply'd she  I will go and fetch a light  She went out to call  Albine  who trembling for fear had no power to come up but had stood all this while at the Bottom of the Stairs and was now ready to run out of her Wits when she was ordered to bring up a Torch For now she thought her self lost for ever the reason was this  You must know that at the first Visit the Earl of  Warwick  made to the Countess of  Devonshire  that fatal Star which sometimes enforces a Heart to enter upon an Amorous Engagement for the remainder of ones Life had such a Powerful Influence upon hers that she did not take all the necessary Precautions to defend her self against that Destiny which we ought to resist with all our Might On the contrary she Cherish'd her Passion and as she had her Mind wholly taken up with the Earl she told  Albine she would have no body speak to her of the King  This old Governess ready to run distracted at the Thoughts to lose all at once the Benefit of such Rich Presents took care not to contradict her Mistress judging that this would prove a means to unfold a secret she intended to make her self Mistress of for her own Benefit  Your Aversion to the King  said she  is not the effect of your Considerations Madam but of something else that pleases you Pray put an entire Confidence in me  I will never misuse it or give you any occasion of repenting Alas  reply'd the Young Countess  of what an easie Temper am I  Albine  hear me with Patience for I shall ease my self a little when I tell you that I am Charm'd with the Deserts and Wit of the Earl of  Warwick  As I am resolved never to enter into an Amorous Engagement with him I will shun him with all my Power making my Duty the only Rule of my Conduct so I am prepared to undergo the most cruel Torments that can be Ah what Comfort it is for one to discharge ones whole Mind to an Affectionate and Faithful Friend I entreat you to let the King know how uneasie my Family is upon his Account and that I beg him not to entertain any further Thoughts of me This being the only Favour I request at his Hands in recompence for all the Respect I bear him  Albine  was at a stand what to do since to break off an Intrigue she judged she had almost brought to its Period was altogether against her Interest She had a Nephew who being a sensible Fellow she made him a Partner in the secret It was then agreed betwixt them that nothing should be told to the King concerning the Countesses indifferency for him and that the better to conceal the Matter they were to open her Letters written to him and in lieu thereof send some of their own making Written in her own Name Though this was a very hazardous Project yet was it well relish'd by  Albine  who was prolonging this Intrigue at any rate But as  Albine  knew very well the King's Impatience to see the Countess and her Aversion to such an Interview she pitch'd upon the following Stratagem  Madam  said she to her  if you will preserve the Earl of  Warwick  from Destruction you must your self explain your Mind to him For flattering himself that his Addresses his Passion and Time will produce in you some favourable Sentiments for him this makes him commit  every day a Thousand Extravagancies to the  uin of his Fortune and of your Reputation You are  ell enough acquainted with my Lord  Devonshire  's Temper so soon as he gets the least discovery that the Earl is in Love with you he will certainly believe  hat you love him also and therefore I advise you to see the Earl and to declare to him that his Hopes are very ill Grounded Oh  Albine said the Countess  what advice is that you give me after I have dis  osed to you the deplorable State of my Heart Is  his the way to cure me to have an Interview with so  ovely an Enemy No no let what Fate will at  end him 'tis better than to run the Risque of seeing him my Eyes would certainly contradict my Words and what a Shame would it be for me to betray my own Infirmities 'Tis enough that I am sensible of them my self and therefore ought to take all possible precautions against them But Madam  reply'd this dangerous Woman  consider what an Injury it would be to him if the King should take an Aversion against him and my Lord  Devonshire  against you And why should he hate me  return'd she with an Air full of Sweetness  Am I Mistress of my own Inclinations Which have Cap  vated my Heart in spite of all the Power I have Am  ot I rather to be pity'd than blamed No Madam  continued the Old Governess  you would not deserve any body's Pity if you refuse a Moments Interview to  he Earl of  Warwick  to tell him your self that he  atters himself with vain hopes and that he ought the sooner the better check his Passion But it may be by that time he has forgot you you will continue still to  emember him O kind Heavens  cry'd the Countess with Tears in her Eyes  I am afraid the Remedy you prescribe has a mixture of Poison in it Nevertheless  continued she  because thou shalt have no Reason to upbraid me upon that Score I will spend a quarter of an hour in an Interview with him  And  was upon this Expression the old Governess  told the King he might come to see the Countess  She was under no small uneasiness when she began to reflect upon the Success of this Appointment how the King would relish the Matter to be brought thither under the Notion of being the Earl of  Warwick  and how the Countess would dispence with this Disappointment▪ when she discovered the Deceit she look'd upon it as one of the most difficult Points that had been manag'd for some Ages But after all she remain'd resolute to venture at all flattering her self that perhaps the whole Intrigue might not be immediately unfolded or that at the worst her Lady could not be very angry at seeing so tender and Amiable a King instead of the Earl of  Warwick  Notwithstanding all this when the Countess call'd for Light she stood amazed like one struck dead However having soon recover'd her self resolved without any more to do to unfold the whole Riddle so throwing her self at the Countesses Feet and holding her by her Night Gown she with a Thousand Imprecations ask'd her Pardon for the Innocent Deceit she had put upon her saving  It was owing to nothing but to her Z  and Affection to see her placed in so Eminent a Station above the rest  She then told her trembling  That it was not the Earl of  Warwick  that stay'd  her in the Room but the King who had continued constant in his Love to her  This put my Lady  Devonshire  into such a Passion that she told  Albine S  would never forgive but hate her as long as she lived  ▪ and so without suffering her to say one Word more away she flung into another Room and shut the Door after her  The Earl of  VVarwick  was much surprized to find the same Person that spoke to him not to come again and he durst not go in search after her for fear of meeting some Body else than what  he look'd for whilst he was thus waiting for the Issue with much impatience he heard something coming near him which said with a low Voice  Sir I am almost in Despair my Lady  Devonshire  is so Capricious that she won't come here again  What have I done  said he  she should shun to see me Her Head is full of  Chimera  's  added that Person  concerning your Passion for Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  if your Majesty will be pleased to take my Advice I would go out of the Garden immediately and leave the rest to my Management to persuade her into a more Complaisant Humour The Earl being a Person of singular vivacity of Wit immediately discovered the Bottom of the Intrigue  so he told  Albine that he lov'd the Countess too Passionately to give her as much as one Moments uneasiness and that he would desire her to deliver a Billet in his behalf to the Countess desiring at the same time some Light Pens Ink and Paper and that as soon as he had Written he would leave the Room The old Governess much pleased with the  opes of his speedy departure went to fetch a light But guess at her Surprize when in lieu of the King whom she expected to meet she saw it was the Earl of  Warwick  she stood stupify'd like a Stone without any Motion except of her Eyes and Mouth but without being able to utter one Word I am sensible  Albine  of the whole Matter  said he  though I want time to explain my self at this Juncture Pray find out a way for me to see your Mistress And I will make Peace both for my self and you Follow me my Lord  said she  but go softly I hope there is one Door or other left unlock'd for us to enter Nor was it long before they found a private Door which leading into a Wardrobe they went forwards and surprized my Lady  Devonshire  all melting in Tears and lying upon  a Couch The Earl threw himself at her Feet before she was sensible any body was near her Is it possible  said he  my Divine Countess I should be so unfortunate as to see you shun me All these hazards I expose my self to in coming hither should not they be look'd upon as the true effects of my Passion How  cry'd she  You must come along with the King Oh I little thought my Lord you would have acted his Confident here Though I am not quite ignorant Madam  reply'd the Earl  of his Sentiments for you yet I declare to you I should have expired with Grief before I could come along with him No Madam I am alone and come for no other reason than to seek your Aid I stand so much in need of to support my self under those Pains which are inseparable Attendants of an unfortunate Passion I neither will nor can afford you any help my Lord  said the Countess  neither did I give my Consent of seeing you upon any other Account but to clear you at once of those flattering Conceptions you have taken in respect to me Go on Madam make an end at once  reply'd he  Stab me to the Heart here is my Sword and since I have bin so bold as to lift up my Eyes to adore you don't refuse me the Grace of being Punish'd by your own Hands But if your Goodness would afford me some few Moments to enter upon my Justification I could Madam make you sensible of the sincerity of my Passion Do you remember my Lord  said she interrupting him  that you talk to the Countess of  Devonshire  who can't be innocent as long as she hears you talk at that rate Then cease for ever to love me and to tell me that you do for I can make you no other returns but those of Ingratitude Oh Madam  cry'd the Earl  I know too well that I have flattered my self you can admit of no Slaves under the Degree of Kings You  judge not rightly of my Inclinations  answer'd the Countess  since it is my Duty that engages me and I dare be so frank as to tell you That were I in a Condition to make my Choice betwixt the King and you my Lord you shou'd have no Reason of Complaint but after all don't presume upon this account for no body will reap the least Benefit by it These Words occasion'd an inexpressible Confusion in the Earl in spite of those few Glimpses of Hopes he conceived in some of her Expressions in entertaining him at so late an Hour and in so secret a manner but she still intreated him to desist and not to disturb her Repose by such Addresses for which she should think her self but little obliged to him The Earl answered to every Particular with so much Respect and Passion that at last she could not refrain from telling him with a very melancholy Air Oh my Lord How came I to know you What a strange Fatality to happen to a young Person who always led a retired Life Alas Madam permit me  said he  to bear some Share in your solitude I should think my self too Happy and it should be the only Endeavour of my Life and all my Care to allay the Hardships of your Retiredness by a Thousand complaisant Actions Oh God  reply'd she  The Comfort you propose is too full of Danger you must shun me my Lord and I must shun you  The Earl was so much surprized with Admiration at a Thousand other pretty things she told him that the time pass'd away very fast and as according to the old Proverb  A Lover's Watch goes seldom exact  so had it not bin for  Albine  they had scarce parted at yet tho' it was already break of Day The Earl would have given any thing in the World to have given enjoy'd the Charming Company of the Fair Countess for a few Hours longer  but no time was to be lost for fear of being overheard at going away so he parted but with so much Grief and Vexation as is scarce to be express'd  Berincour  stai'd for the Earl's coming under the Wall but there was no occasion for his helping him over it as he was oblig'd to do before  Albine  who attended him having found Means by this time to open the little Door and being by his great Promises entirely engaged in his Interest she told him She would by representing to the King the Indifferency of the Countess for his Person endeavour to Cure him of a Passion which hath a much greater share of Inconveniencies than Pleasure in it  My Lord  Warwick  now overjoy'd at his Interview with my Lady  Devonshire  goes home to bestow the best part of the Night in indulging his Fancy with the fresh Remembrance of so Charming a Person He was scarce fall'n a sleep when very early in the Morning one of his Servants came in to tell him that the General must of Necessity speak with him immediately after he enters the Room with so much gaiety in his Countenance and Actions that the Earl who knew him always to be of a grave Deportment not knowing what to make of it look'd stedfast at him not without some Signs of Surprize and the more he observed the General to take notice of it the more he appear'd to be pleased at it What an Alteration  cry'd the Earl  What is the Matter my Lord May one be permitted to know some Part of your Secrets Ah my Dear my Lord  said he  embracing him you see here before you the most Happy Man in the World Look stedfastly upon me For without Vanity there is not a Man now living up on Earth who can match my Good Fortune I understand you  reply'd the Earl  you have found out a Cure for that troublesome Passion which so lately play'd the Tyrant over your Heart A Cure do you say  reply'd the General abruptly  I would rather choose to die you may take my Word for it I am more Lovesick than ever I was Then you have made some considerable Advances  said he  towards the Heart of the Countess of  Devonshire  Oh  said the General  there you have hit it right Pray mind how the Intrigue was carry'd on  The  imner who sold me the Picture of this Lady judging by the great Value he saw me put upon it and by the Instructions I gave him to persuade the King that it was the Fair  Rosamond  's Picture that all these things were not done without very weighty Reasons on my side and that therefore my Heart bore great share in all these Assiduities at last began to be satisfy'd I was in Love with the Countess of  Devonshire  As he was not ignorant of how difficult an access she was so he proposed to me the removing of these Obstacles which otherwise might prevent my having an Interview with her I need not tell you whether I was ready to embrace his Offer or whether I engaged him further into my Interest by very large Presents 'tis enough to let you know that this last Night when it was pitch dark he conducted me into the Lady  Anglesey  's Garden and from thence into a Grotto by the help of some Lights Here I beheld the Countess with a more Beautiful Lustre than the Sun it self that gives us Light she shew'd a Thousand engaging Complaisances for me and at last ask'd me for my large Diamond which she put upon her Finger and in lieu thereof presented me with this small Turquoise cut in the Shape of a Heart a thing I shall always look upon inestimable  Don't you wonder  continued he  at the oddness of Chance how that things that seem to be sometimes at the greatest distance from our Hopes are brought to pass by such unexpected Means For pray my Lord consider Who could have imagined that a little Picturedrawer should have the Management of a Person that is the Wonder of our Age I ask'd him How it possibly could happen so He told me frankly that in all Probability she would not have admitted him for her Confident had she bin at Liberty to choose another But that he having work'd for a considerable time for my Lady  Anglesey  he was consider'd in the Family as one of their old Domesticks and had the Liberty of talking with the Countess without being in the least suspected by any That considering how lavishly I paid for the Picture it came into his Head I must needs be in Love with her That he took the Boldness to discover his Opinion concerning me to the Countess who fetching a deep Sigh told him Alas I am not so Happy he thinks of no other Passion than what relates to Glory That he thereupon recall  d to her Remembrance the Amours of  Mars  and  Venus  and  Hercules  and  Omphale  Upon which she reply'd What you tell me are nothing but Fables Now judge my Lord  added the General  what an infinite Pleasure such an unexpected Accident must cause within me all my Hopes were before this confin'd to no more than to adore without displeasing her but now I think I dare promise my self I am not hated by this Beautiful Lady  The Earl of  Warwick  could hold no longer but burst out a laughing a thing he would not have bin fond of at another time but that he had bin with the Countess the same Night I find  said the General  without giving him leasure to speak  by your Mirth you are overjoy'd at my Good Fortune I am  reply'd he  to such a degree that I should be less sensible of my own The General embracing him My Lord  said he  I believe my self the only Man in the World who has so Good a Master so Beautiful a Mistress and so Tender a Friend The Earl was ready to burst to keep himself from laughing at the General's Fancy of being belov'd by the Countess and at his being thus impos'd upon by the Limner This made him most seriously reflect upon the Frailties even of the greatest Men in the World when once they are seiz'd with a violent Passion and had his own for my Lady  Devonshire  not got quite the Ascendant over him he would have abjur'd and vow'd not to engage in it as long as he liv'd I don't question my Lord  said he to the General  that by the Assistance of this Limner you will have frequent Opportunities of seeing the Countess This is so great a Blessing  reply'd he  that were it only in my Power I would not miss a Day of seeing her But she is oblig'd to act with so much Precaution that I dare not urge that point too far for fear her Complaisance should turn to her great Prejudice Some other Discourse pass'd betwixt them all relating to the same Subject Then the General took his Leave and the Earl got out of Bed in order to pay forthwith a Visit to Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  being very impatient to know the Success of the King's Visit from her own Mouth  She was still in Bed but he had immediate Access because he visited her frequently and that often by the King's Order Well Madam  said he  Have you got the Victory Was it possible he should hold out against such powerful Charms as yours Have you still a Rival in Being Oh my Lord  cry'd she  you can't imagine to what a  degree the King loves her I know too much of it not to be sensible of every thing and not to have penetrated in the very depth of his Heart What is it I have not discovered there I was ready to run distracted but barbarous Man as he is if my Lameutations at certain Intervals touch'd his Heart the Idea of my Lady  Devonshire  return'd with such an irresistable Power that in his very Eyes I could read his secret Anger if not his Hatred against me But after all I would not have him imagine that I will tamely fall a Sacrifice to him but am resolved to venture at every thing my Despair suggests to me How Madam  said the Earl  and could not you get from him as much as one positive Assurance that he would love nothing but you So far from it  said she  that he would not as much as own his Passion but conceal'd it to the utmost for fear I should give disturbance to a Person that is so dear to him He is not much in the wrong on't  answer'd the Earl smiling  you seem to me not the fittest Person to be entrusted therewith I am a going to write a  etter to him  said she  and I will desire you to deliver it No  said he  don't let him know of my coming here▪ for as the least Accident might  so it would diserable  Well  by another Person  present when it is given to the  and writ the following Lines  IS it possible it should  so  and your Majesty has not as yet  Messenger to know at what time I died last Night Certain it is that and Body else but my self would have dy'd of Grief tho' I am so  as to survive it I will flatter my self that  serves me to taste the Pleasure  of Revenge Yes Sir I am not ignorant of the Means to punish the Person that robbs me of your Heart a Loss that is irrepairable to me which since it has happened I put not the least Value upon my Life My Rival then must dread the utmost Efforts of my Despair and your Majesty blame himself for ever for having bin the Occasion thereof  The Earl of  Warwick  was no sooner come to Court but passing by the King's Closet he was call'd in and his Majesty senting himself in an Elbowchair told him Have you heard nothing of the pretty Parts the young  Elizabeth  acted before me No  reply'd the Earl  I know nothing of it I have nothing  reply'd the King  but Reproaches Crys Lamentations and Violence I would above all things fain know who is her Counselgiver since I can't imagine who should think it his Business to tell her of my being in Love with the Countess of  Devonshire  and what is more who it is that knows it  Albine  understands her own Interests better than to betray this Intrigue and her self and the young Lady can't be so simple to divulge it Who then cou'd this be I hope Sir  said the Earl  your Majesty does not suspect me No  said the King  tho' in LoveConcerns you are none of the most  at least  reply'd the Earl  I was so in this I tell you again  continued the King  I don't mean you  ut am extreamly vex'd to see this young Woman in so dismal a Condition I am afraid she will not outlive it The Earl who had a mind to dive into the true Sentiments of his Master told him with a Smile I am apt to believe your Majesty ought not to be much afflicted if she should die since you loving another she will be pestering you continually with a Thomsand Reprouches In my Opinion nothing is more troublesome than  to please Two Mistresses 'Tis true  reply'd the King  as my Passion is always sincere so I shall find it troublesome enough but as for you who are the greatest Dissembler in the Kingdom you would be able to have a Dozen or two at once and impose upon them all so that none of them should be the wiser for it He had scarce spoken these Words when Mrs  Lucy  's Billet being deliver'd to him he first perus'd it by himself but after a little pausing upon the matter read it aloud There is a young Lady in a violent Passion  said the King  What is your Opinion of her The Earl who saw in his Eyes some infallible Marks and Returns of his Tenderness for her told him Sir I hope if she continues in the same Humour she will scarce live till Night What is it  said the King  she would have she frames a world of Chimeras on purpose to plague her self Has she observ'd me less Passionate less Generous or less frank in my Addresses What is it makes her believe I am in Love with another Go you and pay her a Visit assure her in my behalf that if she loses me it is by reason of her Mistrust and to be short endeavour to make her as easie as possibly you can But Sir  said the Earl  if you are so much delighted in that new Passion you have embrac'd Why will you trouble your self with another Were it not much better to leave her to her own Despair Go  said the King  and perform what I ordered you to do  My Lord of  Warwick  rejoic'd to the Heart at this Commission went straight to Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  's unto whom having given a full account of all that had pass'd betwixt them they soon agreed upon what Answer he was to return to the King He in the mean while diverting his Thoughts with Walking in St  James  's  Park  the Earl soon  perceived him advancing a great pace without talking to any Body but no sooner espi'd the Earl when he ask'd him How does this young Extravagant Lady do Sir  said he  she appear'd to me not at all disturb'd We soon entred upon the Point of the Affections and Goodness you had for her Person and I conjured her to believe you were the same now without the least Change That these Insinuations proceeded from her Enemies who infused false Notions into her on purpose to disturb her Repose possibly thereby to check your Passion for her That therefore she ought to be upon her Guard and not to be imposed upon at that rate She told me with much unconcernedness That to her certain knowledge she was inform'd of all the Circumstances of the whole Intrigue that she flatter'd her self your Majesty would have made a sincere Return to her but now she could hope for nothing her Resolution was fix'd and so  continued he  she turn'd away and would not answer me one Word more to whatever I could say so after having staid for sometime longer I went my ways But as I was going along her Gallery which is pretty dark I felt something pull me back and looking backwards found it to be  Eleenor  with Tears in her Eyes My Lord  said she  my Mistress has certainly some sinister Designs in her Head she intends to put an End to her Life she ord'red me to get her some  Opium  but to mention it to no Body How  cry'd the King  Do you think she will be so foolish as to poison her self Do you question it Sir  said the Earl  Is not your Majesty sufficiently acquainted with the Temper of the  English  Women who despise Death as much as those Illustrious  Roman  Ladies that dy'd by their own Hands without the least Regret or Fear  I must confess to you  said the King with a very Melancholly Air  I am not proof against this Tryal I love her and she is desperate What must I do in this case Sir  reply'd the Earl  you must love her absolutely whom you love best and let the other perish or do as well as she can or will Oh I can't do that  cry'd the King  and so leaning against a Tree continued in a deep study for sometime till he who us'd to receive the Countess of  Devonshire  's Letters presented one to him At the sight of this dear Character recovering himself he open'd the Pacquet with much Precipitation but found nothing therein that pleas'd him for she told him as has been agreed upon betwixt her and  Albine  That the Countess of  Anglesey  had made her a Bedchamber so near to her own that they must pass through the last into the first And that since she must be lost for ever if this Intrigue should be known in the Family she begg'd him not to disturb her Repose by doing an Action the Noise whereof must needs cost her infinite Vexation and Troubles And that he would be pleased to stay for a more favourable Conjuncture  The Stile of this Letter being very different from that of the preceeding ones put the King actually in a Passion he tore it to pieces saying She deserved not the Respect he had always shewn her and that the whole savouring very much of a Fickledness he would make her repent of it and that after having ruined her Reputation by the publishing of his Passion for her he would compleat her Destruction by his Indifferency That he intended to go see her in Person and to upbraid her in the Face of the whole Court with her Inconstancy That would prove an infallible Means  said the Earl  of the Death at least of three People  Elizabeth Lucy  will certainly  poison her self General  Talbot  will die for Grief when he understands that your Majesty is likely to traverse his Love and the Earl of  Devonshire  out of Madness and Jealousy will kill his Lady No matter  said the King  I am resolv'd once in my Life time to follow the Inclinations of my own Heart without hearkening to a thousand Reasons that are contradictory to my Satisfaction I don't presume so far Sir  answer'd the Earl  as to engage your Majesty into what I propose in good earnest Madam  Elizabeth Lucy  is not deserving enough for you to offer any Violence to your Inclinations General  Talbot  has acted a very unwise Part to give way to such a Passion and as for the Countess of  Devonshire  I would advise your Majesty to make Love to her with Trumpets sounding tho' she was to be poison'd within a Quarter of an Hour after Whilst he was talking thus the King remain'd in a ruminating Posture without answering a Word and soon after return'd to his Palace  Immediately after Dinner he went to pay a Visit to his Mistress whom he presented with a very rich Jewel it was an Excellent Piece of Engraving upon a large Ruby of a most exquisite Lustre besides which there was a fine Diamond cut in the Shape of a Heart the whole Devise represented a Moon in a vast Sea with this Inscription  She causes my Calms and my Tempests  He told her at the same time a thousand engaging things conjuring her for the future not to load him with Reproaches he deserved not The Marchioness receiv'd it with equal Demonstrations of Joy and Acknowledgment She was overjy'd to find the Devise apply'd to her notwithstanding which with Tears in her Eyes she made some few gentle Reflections upon the King And he thinking he had done enough for one  Day would not urge her at that time to discover to him the Persons who had given her information of these things tho' at the same time he continu'd in his Resolution of finding it out It was so late before all the Articles of Peace were well regulated that they Supp'd together When the Earl came to pay his Respects to the King and found himself at full Liberty to speak his Sentiments My thinks  said he to the King  I see in your Eyes the Conquest of Madam  Elizabeth Lucy  and the Defeat of my Lady  Devonshire  No  reply'd he  you are mistaken in your Sight There is still remaining in my Heart a very agreeable Idea I am not able to efface so soon as I would But Sir  said the Earl  dare I take the Liberty to ask your Majesty if really you could wish it so The King after pausing a while  reply'd  I don't very well know what I could wish for I imagine to my self an absolute Felicity in pleasing the Countess but on the other Hand am dissatisfy'd with her and fear lest Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  should die for Vexation unless she has the Preference before the other What then intend you to do Sir  said the Earl  I am resolved to talk with my Lady  Devonshire added the King  This being the very thing the Earl dreaded most either for fear of the Noise such a Visit would make in the World or the Jealousy the Duke of  Devonshire  might conceive thereat or out of a just Apprehension lest the Countess might be overtaken with the Deserts and Grandure of this young Monarch But on which side soever he consider'd it it appear'd very dangerous to him Sir  said he  you may write to the Countess to let her know that unless she will find out some Opportunity for you to see her you know how to pitch upon a Time your self let the Consequence to her prove what it will By this Means you will oblige  her to act with all possible Diligence and to surmount all Obstacles You may see her without making a Noise in the World and you may save both your Mistresses The King lik'd his Advice being well pleas'd not to give any real Occasion of Pain to one whilst he sought to please the other  The Earl was no sooner return'd home but he writ to his charming Countess every thing a Heart full of Love is able to inspire into a Man especially when he flatters himself not to be hated by the Party belov'd he being a Person of an uncommon Vivacity of Thoughts and most refin'd Wit his Expressions were so Nice Natural and Noble that his Wit prov'd as great a Charm to the Countess as his Person Being ready to die with Impatience he desir'd Permission to see her again but things were to be done with so much Circumspection that they durst not so soon venture at another Nocturnal Rendezvous which might prove of very ill Consequence  However they having found means to get the print of the Key of the LittleGardengate before it was return'd to the Countess of  Anglesey Albine  sent it to the Earl who charging  Berincour  to have one made immediately after the same Pattern he spoke about it to a LockSmith who after a great many Exceptions to enhaunce the Price of his Labour at last made one according to the Mould  The Earl being extreamly glad to see himself Master of a Key that could give him Entrance into the Garden now expected with the utmost Impatience the next favourable Opportunity to make use of it when the King sent him a Messenger before Day break to order him to come to Court He made all the haste he could and found the King already in his Closet much disturbed  at the News he had received that King  Henry  his Rival had obtain'd a certain Number of Troops from the Queen of  Scots  besides  French  Auxiliaries sent him by that King at the Intercession of  Renault d' Anjou  King of  Sicily  his Fatherinlaw with the Queen that  Amazon  of our Age at the Head of them They have by this time join'd all their Forces  said he to the Earl  and are preparing to march against ours Go then and with all possible speed join your Brother in order to make a powerful Opposition against the Efforts of the Enemy The Earl used always to shew a great deal of Satisfaction whenever he was to leave  London  on account of appearing in Arms for the King but upon this Occasion he was too sensible how much the Goddess of Love prevailed over the God of War The King much surprized at his Silence and heavy Countenance What is the matter  said he  you are so much alter'd that I scarce know you it seems as if you were troubled at the Choice I have made No Sir  said he  I am very sensible of your Goodness and am resolv'd to acquit my self so well of my Duty that you shall have no Reason to repent of having preferr'd my Services to the rest Ah  said the King  I find how it is you are in Love You have found nothing Sir  reply'd the Earl with a Smile  I am preparing to obey your Orders He went straightways home but full of Trouble and Vexation He sent  Berincour  to speak with  Albine  and to promise her any thing she could desire in the World provided she would find out but a few favourable Moments wherein he might bid Adieu to his Fair Mistress She left no Stone unturn'd to do it but in spite of all her Care and Industry no Opportunity did offer and my Lady  Devonshire  would not give a helping Hand to procure one He writ her a Letter as  full of Passion as Respect unto which after some Irresolution she return'd an Answer wishing him a Happy Journey and a Fortunate Campaign  Of this she was even ready to repent as soon as it was done and told  Albine  What would become of me should this Billet be intercepted 'Tis not enough for one to be Innocent but one ought to act so as not to appear blameable to any Madam  reply'd the old Governess  you torment your self with things at a great Distance Don't you know that you have always reason enough to be sati  fy'd within your self if you have acted nothing that is really blameable But Good God  Albine continu'd the Countess  How can I be so Was it fitting for me to write to my Lord of  Warwick  In short could I wish the Earl of  Devonshire  now to be my Confident This and such like Discourse pass'd betwixt them whilst her Letter was deliver'd to the Earl who was so delighted therewith that for a time he could read nothing else but that  However in spite of all his Endeavours not being able to compass an Interview he saw himself under a Necessity of going for the Army and having join'd the Marquess of  Montague  his Brother a Battle was fought near  Exham  wherein King  Henry  having the Misfortune to be routed was forc'd to seek for his Safety in his Flight leaving most of his Faithful Friends to the Mercy of his Victorious Enemies whereupon  Henry  Duke of  Sommerset Robert  Earl of  Hungerford  and  Thomas Rosse  had their Heads cut off by King  Edward  's Order  Whilst the unfortunate King  Henry  was endeavouring to save himself by Flight Queen  Margeret  his Spouse who had during the Battel outbraved all Dangers seeing all lost thought now  of nothing so much as the Preservation of the Prince of  Wales  This young Infant being now to her the Dearest thing she had left in the World she took him before her on Horseback and making the best of her Way to a spacious Forest lay conceal'd there for several Days never stirring forward but in the dark of the Night But what should they do for Sustenance the Forest afforded nothing but some wild Fruits and the Child not being able to resist much longer the Want of wholesome Nourishment and the great Fatigues it had endured the disconsolate Mother sent up her most servent Prayers to Heaven and imagining that nothing could be superadded to her present Misery in travelling forward fell in among a Gang of Highwaymen who at first appear'd not a little surpriz'd at their meeting with a Lady of so Majestick an Air and in so magnificent an Attire in so solitary a Place notwithstanding which they stripp'd her to her very Peticoat but a Contest arising betwixt them about the sharing of the Rich Jewels they had taken from her whilst they were preparing to fight for the Booty she laid hold of this favourable Opportunity to make her Escape So taking her Son in her Arms she run notwithstanding this Burthen which Love render'd light to her into an adjacent Wood Here wandring about till all her Strength fail'd her she was forc'd to lay down upon the Ground  'Tis in this Place my Dear Child  said she to the Prince bathing him with her Tears and squeezing him betwixt her Arms  'Tis here the Queen of  England  and the Heir to the Crown must end their Lives  She had scarce spoken these Words when one of the Highwaymen passing by the Place alone where this Princess utter'd her Lamentations she took Courage and told him  Take my Friend  ake this Child  said she presenting to him the  rince  save the King's Son  This Man touch'd with Compassion and Respect received with much Satisfaction this dear Pledge from this Princesses Hands who being supported by him made shift to get to a River where she embark'd aboard a Vessel which carry'd her to  luyce  from whence she went to  Bruges  leaving her Son behind her in that Place for fear he should not be able to undergo the Fatigues of a long Journey she intended to take to solicit fresh Succours of Men and Money As for the unfortunate King  Henry  he retreated into a remote Place of  Wales  but finding he could not time enough reassemble his Friends and broken Forces went away in disguise but was immediately after discovered taken and carry'd to  London  King  Edward  shut him up in the Tower where he endured a long Captivity  The Earl of  Warwick  having left the Command of the Army to his Brother to disperse the broken Remnants of the Enemy's Forces upon his return to Court could not reap the full Fruits of his Victories by reason of his Passion for the Countess of  Devonshire  though King  Edward  received him with a thousand Demonstrations of Friendship and Esteem and bestow'd uncommon Praises upon his Conduct and Bravery The Countess of  Devonshire  her self taking no small share in his Glory and safe return was not averse in her self of seeing him but there being certain Impossibilities which made the Earl Languish to a very high degree he wrote such engaging Letters to this lovely Lady as served to remove all further Indifferency from her Heart  Thus Matters stood when the King going to a hunting Match in  Oxfordshire  happened to pass  by so near a certain Country Seat then inhabited by the Dutchess  Dowager  of the late Duke of  Bedford  Regent in  France  under  Henry  IVth King of  England  his Uncle that he had a Curiosity of paying a Visit to her The Name of this Lady was  Jacueline  of  Luxenburgh  eldest Daughter to  Peter  of  Luxenburgh  Count of  S Pol  who notwithstanding the great Lustre of her Family had bin by the irresistible Power of Love constrained to condescend to the marrying of a private Gentleman named  Richard Rivers  and that at a time when the most illustrious Families both in  France  and  England  sought for her Alliance She had by this Gentleman several Children and among the rest  Elizabeth Rivers  a Ladv endow  d with all the advantages of Mind and Body that render a Person of her Age most Accomplish'd Her Parents being not Masters of an Estate sufficient to make her appear at Court marry'd her to one Mr  John Grey  a Person no wise Superiour to her self and of an indifferent Estate but being Naturally inclined to Jealousy constantly lived at his own Country House and when he was obliged to be at his Post in the Army used to leave his Wife with the Dutchess of  Bedford  He happening to be Slain in an Engagement whilst she was yet very Young she continued with her Mother so that this Family enjoy  d the innocent Pleasures of the Country in a most perfect Union though her present Station appear'd very different from that high Rank the Dutchess of  Bedford  was once placed in in the World for besides her Lords and her own Estate she had a yearly pension of Crowns a prodigious Summ in those days  The King had taken a fancy to hunt in one of the fittest days for that purpose the Air being  Gloomy no Wind stirring and without being incommoded by the Dust or Heat He was then attended only by the Duke of  Gloucester  his Brother and the Earl of  Warwick  the rest being left in an adjacent Wood to expect his return thither Madam  Grey  happened to be walking in a long Walk with  Thomas  and  Richard  her two Sons in each of her Hands being both so Young and Beautiful that they resembled the  Amours  that are said to be of  Venus  her Attendance She was in a plain but very neat Dress and her Person appear'd all over extreamly engaging Having never seen the King nor any of those that were along with him the first thing she did was to pull a large Vail over her Face after which she saluted them but without stopping in the least or casting so much as one Look at them The King equally taken with her Modesty and Beauty notwithstanding he knew her no more than she did him alighted and accosted her with that Polite and Noble Air which distinguishes those that are Masters of it from the common Rank of Men After having saluted her he ask'd with a Gallant Air whether being alone she fear'd not some  Paris  or other should act over again his Part with the fair  Helen She told him  that these Adventures were suitable only to the Age of  Homer  and that in this solitary Place they had neither a  Paris  nor a  Helen  The longer the King heard her speak the more he delighted in hearing her and asking after the Dutchess of  Bedford  understood beyond Expectation that Madam  Grey  was her Daughter  As they came nearer to the House the Dutchess who look'd out of a Window of her Closet was not a little surprized to see her Daughter betwixt the King the Duke of  Gloucester  and the Earl of  Warwick  She went out to meet them and to pay her Respects to the young King which Madam  Grey  perceiving was under no small Confusion considering she had not paid him the Respect due to his Person He who took Notice of every thing she did soon guessing at her Thoughts told her a thousand Engaging and Gallant things upon that Head and that with so much Vivacity of Wit that she never had met with any thing Comparable to it in all her Life But this so agreeable a Conversation lasted not long the King turning on a sudden very pensive in spite of all his Endeavours against it However he took up the two young Sons of the young Window and bestow'd his Carasses upon them whilst his Looks were very attentively fix'd upon the Mother The Earl of  Warwick  not so much prepossess'd as the King talk'd with the Dutchess of  Bedford  and at the same time took particular Notice of his growing Passion He conjured the two Ladies to come to  London  I assure you  said he to the Dutchess of  Bedford That the Dutchess of  York  will be overjoy'd to see you again you having pass'd the best of your days together it is but reasonable you should both recal those times to your Memory and that now I am King I may do that for your Children that I was not in a Condition to do whilst I was yet Earl of  Marche  Madam  Bedford  and  Grey  return'd their Thanks with all the Marks of Acknowledgments and the King fearing lest Notice might be taken of the Satisfaction he took in the Company of these Ladies he took leave though with much Reluctancy but could not forbear to speak a thousand times of the fair Widow as an entire Piece of Perfection  Some few days after he told the Earl of  Warwick  she had made so lively an Impression upon him that he could not live unless he saw her again and yet he feared to displease her if he should come thither again so soon desiring him therefore to consider of some way or other to bring them to Court The Earl who had a very piercing Wit told the King that the whole Family having no considerable Estate the only way would be to bestow some Preferments upon the Father and Brother of Madam  Grey  and a Pension upon her Children to be bred at Court and a Place upon the Dutchess of  Bedford  under the Dutchess of  York  And that Madam  Grey  engaged by all these Favours done to her Family would easily quit her Solitude to enjoy the Pleasures of the World The King relishing the Earl's Advice in a little time heap'd Favours upon Favours upon that Family The Dutchess of  Bedford  with her Husband and Children came to  London  but the young Widow who was the Person most desired there remain'd in the Country The King vex'd to the Heart at her Absence went on purpose to fetch her He made her a thousand Reproaches on account of her Indifferency but at the same time omitted nothing that might engage her to come to Court You are too dangerous Sir  said she to him with a gay and most charming Air  Hitherto my Vertue was never put to the Tryal living alone at my own Home at the Bottom of a Village intent upon nothing but how to please my Husband and to lament his loss I have seen nothing hitherto that gave me the least Occasion of Fear But I am very sensible Sir should I see you often I should have great Occasion to dread you I am also no less sensible that my Virtue will never stoop so low  as to be your Mistress and that my Fortune is not exalted enough to aspire to a Throne I disclose  continued she  to your Majesty at once what another perhaps would not have told you till after some years But I shall at least have this Satisfaction not to give you any Cause of Vexation by entertaining you with vain Hopes  The King who was not used to be so frankly dealt withal having paused a little upon the Matter  told her  She might expect every thing from her Deserts That he could never be Happy without her That he would give his Promise to marry her but that it must be kept secret and not to be disclosed upon any account whatever since he had as yet many Enemies who would not fail to improve his Marriage with her to his Disadvantage That therefore he Conjured her to put Confidence in the Word of a Prince who adored her and that unless she came to  London  he was resolved to find her out every day in the Country The Lady look'd upon this Condescension in the King  not rejecting her Proposition of engaging in so unequal a Match as so signal a Favour that she had no longer Power to refuse to come to Court where she came to live with the Dutchess of  Bedford  her Mother The several Visits the King had made to this fair Widow the satisfaction he express'd at her coming to  London  together with the Care he took in fitting up her Lodgings occasioned an extream Jealousy in Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  On the other Hand Madam  Grey  who had no less her own Interest in view judged it very requisite to engage the Earl of  Warwick  on her side which she effected by giving him peculiar Marks of her Esteem and Confidence in him such as she was sensible he could do no otherwise than repay  with Acknowledgment She Conjured him to cultivate for ever a strict Friendship with her and to give her some insight concerning those Persons she ought to fear most  The Earl overjoy'd at this Proposition represented to her the Countess of  Devonshire  as the Person for whom the King had the most passionate Inclination He desired her to keep this as an absolute Secret promising to advertise her from time to time of whatever was likely to impair her Interest So that as often as he observed in the King some Relapses of his Tenderness for this Countess he gave Notice thereof either by Word of Mouth or by Letters to Madam  Grey  who made use of Tears and sometimes of Threats that she would retire into the Country All this was done so seasonably that the King took all imaginable Care to conceal from her the Frailty of his Heart though at the same time he let slip no Opportunity of obliging the Countess of  Devonshire  He would write to her by the Assistance of  Albine  sometimes in the Language of a Lover sometimes of a Soveraign Master but always like a King full of Passion But the Deserts of my Lord of  Warwick  had made so lively an Impression upon her Heart that in spire of all her Endeavours to banish him thence he was always there present this being the only thing she now took any satisfaction in and all the rest proving indifferent to her She would not take the Trouble of Dressing herself nay she would blame her self to appear in any set Dress since it was not done to please him Neither was there any Conversation she so much delighted in as in that of  Albine  because it was to her alone she could speak concerning the Person she had already loved too much for the Tranquility of her Life  The Countess of  Anglesey  who narrowly observed all the Actions of her Daughter did not impart to any body Living the Surprize she was in to find so strange an Alteration in her Daughter but resolved to discourse her upon that Point believing that considering her tender Age and most excellent Education she would not fail to make an ingenuous Confession So without insisting upon any further Preliminaries in the Matter she took her Daughter one day into the Garden at an Hour when it was yet too Hot to take much Diversion in walking for any considerable time and leaning upon her went into the Grotto under Pretence of being scorched by the Heat of the Sun and of having a Mind to rest a little there but in effect to talk to her in that Place with the more freedom 'Tis impossible for me  said my Lady  Anglesey  as soon as they were seated  to see you any longer in the Condition you are in without asking the reason of it I don't do this out of Curiosity or Severity to make you stand in awe of me no my Dear Daughter my Intention is not either to chide or to reproach you 'Tis an easie Matter for one of your Age to commit a Fault that is perhaps not well understood I aim at nothing else than to provide you with Arms to encounter it I would be acquainted with your Pain with an intention to ease it Believe me Daughter that in laying open your Heart to me you run not the least hazard but in shutting it up against me you are in great Danger Give me Entrance there and be not afraid lest if I should meet there with a Stranger I little look for it should either surprize or raise me into a Passion I will mingle my Tears with yours I will be to you instead of a Shield to protect you against the most dangerous Darts  of an Enemy whom perhaps you alone are too weak to resist  Whilst she was a talking the young Countess was Ruminating what answer to give her and what was best to be done in so pressing a Case as this She knew very well her Mother to be a Woman of great Sense and Penetration she knew her to be  aughty positive in her Opinion and one who would not be removed from what she had once conceived to be true let her say what she would But to Sacrifice the Earl of  Warwick  was such an affliction her Heart could not in the least consent to since this Confession must for ever Rob her of the Pleasures of seeing him After all her Mother's Discourse drawing to a Conclusion an answer must be given unless she would make her self appear Guilty by her Silence She took immediately a Resolution what to do and throwing herself at her Mothers Feet Madam  said she to her  I own my self Guilty of a great Crime in not having immediately revealed to you a Thing wherein I ought to have had Recourse to your Conduct 'Tis that alone I blame my self for being for the rest sufficiently Proof against any Impressions contrary to my Duty I will then confess to you in all sincerity That which puts me into so Melancholy a Humour of late is that I am so closepursued by the King You will discover in this Letter his Sentiments for me and mine for his Person You will be sensible of his Design of noising the Matter abroad I tremble at the Misfortune of my Father and Husband I lived in Hopes to tire him out by my Rigorous Proceedings without provoking his Anger But Madam see see how angry he is With these Words She put the King's last Letter into her Mother's Hands which was delivered to her by  Albine  who having Perused it burst out into Tears for Joy and embracing her Daughter My Dear Child  said she to her  don't fear any Man living we are too Happy in so Vertuous a Daughter How few are there that would not be puff'd up with the Passion of son Amiable a King But how dangerous it is to trust him You see his unfaithfulness to the Fair  Elizabeth Lucy  and the lovely Madam  Grey  both which he loved so Passionately being Charm'd with their Beauties Rest satisfy'd That you would not be in a Condition to fix him as well they because they have much more Cunning and understand the Affairs of the World much better than you Let let the King alone tho' at the Peril of all our Lives The good Mother spoke these Words with a great deal of Passion and affording a free Course to her Tears the young Countess could not refrain to do the same She remain'd all this while at her Feet and were laying over the Matter with a great deal of Vehemency when the Earls of  Anglesey  and  Devonshire  entred the  Grotto  They were surprized to find them in this Posture the Countess of  Anglesey  perceived it and judging rightly that nothing could prove more prejudicial to her Daughter than if the Earl of  Devonshire  should get it into his Head that she had bin reprimanding her Daughter concerning her ill Conduct especially since she knew him to have conceived some Jealousy already at the Accidental meeting of her Daughter with the King in the Forrest and that he had told some hard and reflecting Words to her upon that account She desired the Earls of  Angiesey  and  Devonshire  to give attention to what she was a going to discover to them You will I don't doubt  continued she  Commend the Countess  of  Devonshire  for her firmness and sincerity Look here upon this Letter from the King she Communicated to me full of Threats in case she continues to treat him with Indifferency The Earl of  Devonshire  took the Letter a Colour rising in his Face which sufficiently discover'd his Uneasiness and being well acquainted with the Character of his Master had the satisfaction of being an Eye Witness of his Complaints He told my Lady  Anglesey  he never questioned his Wives Conduct knowing the Sincerity and good Inclinations of her Heart and that it was an Action worthy herself to prefer her Duty to all the Airy Ideas of Greatness The Earl of  Anglesey  on his side was not able to express his satisfaction The young Countess said little but at that Juncture secretly blamed herself for not Sacrificing the Earl of  Warwick  in the same manner as she had done the King  Their Conversation being over she retired into her Apartment to tell  Albine  every thing that happened She fail'd not to give immediate Notice thereof to the Earl of  Warwick  who judged not without great reason that the Countess and her Family would now not stay longer in  London  since every thing would appear suspicious there and that he must prepare for a most Cruel Separation What he had foreseen came soon to pass The Earl of  Devonshire  told his Fatherinlaw That since the King would not be easily repulsed the best means to make him to think no more of the Countess would be to let her Mother carry her along with her to  Twittenham  and his Advice being fully approved by the Earl of  Anglesey  every thing necessary for their Departure was got ready with great secrecy In the mean while the King continuing  to labour under no small uneasiness would fain have Visited my Lady  Devonshire  nor would he have delay'd the Matter had it not bin on account of Madam  Grey  for whom his Passion gathered new strength every day and the Earl of  Warwick  left nothing undone on his side to persuade the King that nothing could be more Beautiful nor more fit to be Beloved than her every Word of hers he Represented to the utmost advantage and made the nicest Remarks upon what she never said nay what she perhaps never thought of  The Countess of  Devonshire  being told by her Mother that they intended to carry her into the Country was most sensibly afflicted at this piece of News She disclosed her Pain to  Albine  but forbid her at the same time to let the Earl of  Warwick  know of it But the Treacherous old Governess having but little regard to her Mistresses Orders not only discovered the Matter to him but also gave him to understand that her Mistress would not be able to bid him Farewell unless some unforeseen Opportunity should offer it self The Earl was ready to run distracted at this piece of News and walking very fast up and down the Room when the General came in abruptly looking very heavy and melancholy Ah my Lord  said he  I have heard something that much disturbs my Mind My Lady  Devonshire  is to go along with my Lady  Anglesey  to  Twittenham  I have it under her own Hand but what is worst of all is that there is a suspicion of an Interview betwixt us So that being the occasion of her Lord's jealousy and of the severity of her Mother I am resolved to see her no more What a Change of Fortune is this for a Man who was so very Happy but lately I Compassionate you  reply'd the Earl  but after all you are fully assured  of being Beloved That is but a slender Comfort  reply'd the General  Perhaps it will not be long before she returns  said the Earl  and imagine how acceptable that will prove to you Rather imagine  cry'd he  what I am to suffer during her absence I am to see her to Morrow to take my leave of her and this faithful Limner has bin forced to take a great deal of Pains to procure me that happy Moment The Earl Congratulated him and his Head being too full to permit him to detain the General by insignificant questions He only told him That he was as much concerned at this Mishap as if it were his own and that he hoped that he would do him so much justice as to believe that he was as sensibly touch'd with it as himself co  ld be  So soon as he was at Liberty he made use of all his Wit and Charms which he knew how to make appear in their utmost Lustre when he resolved to do it to persuade the Countess That if she departed without permitting him to see her he should infallibly die of Grief She being most sensibly touch'd with the tender and submissive Expressions of this Letter would perhaps have bin inclinable enough to afford him this Favour but knew not how to hazard a thing of that Consequence in a House which then contained so numerous a Family She consulted about the Matter the same Evening with  Albine  The old Governess had scarce Patience enough to hear the Countess putting her in Mind of the Jealousy and Courage of the Earl of  Devonshire  and that in case the Earl of  Warwick  should be discovered he would be but scurvily used  Albine  I say having a greater share of Avarice than Prudence  reply'd  Let the worst come to the worst the Earl might pretend he was sent thither by the King and so he need not fear any ill usage since that would be  the way to provoke the King to the highest degree The Countess did not give her Consent without a great deal of Reluctancy having observed for several days last past that they were more jealous of her than formerly and knowing that upon the least suspicion the whole Family would take the Alarm But how easie is it to overcome a young Woman prepossess'd in the Favour of him she likes  Albine  promised to remove all obstacles adding That the Earl of  Warwick  would infallibly die for Grief if he should be made sensible of her positiveness in this point And there needed no more to convince the Countess that she might see him without much danger  You will easily imagine he would not miss the Assignation for though that was to be late at Night he fail'd not to rise very early in the Morning and such was his impatience that he thought the day would never be at an end What did not he say to the Sun Every thing a Lover was capable of in his Amorous Frenzies He call'd Night a Thousand times to his Aid and no sooner had the Sky covered it self with its Black Vail but wrapt up in a Cloak and attended only by his faithful  Berincour  he comes to the little Garden Gate not questioning but that his new Key which he had never try'd before would open it without Trouble But all this Care and Pains proved fruitless for the Key broke in the Lock What was now to be done after such a mishap Nothing else but to get over the Wall or else to return from whence he came But as he would rather have chosen to die in attempting the first than to free himself from all danger by the last so without hesitating upon the Matter he Clambred up to the top as he had done once before and was just upon the point  of leaping into the Garden when he saw abundance of People with Flambeaux who appear'd as if they were searching after something In effect my Lady  Anglesey  having lost the Pourtraiture of the Dutchess of  York  she constantly wore on her Arm had not perceived it till after it was Dark and having caused but in vain to search all the Apartments she ordered all the Walks of the Garden to be narrowly view'd for fear the weight of the Gold and Diamonds might make it sink into the Sand  As all the Domesticks were not equally intent upon the Matter some who happened to look upwards perceived the Earl of  Warwick  just ready to leap into the Garden and not doubting but that he was a Thief cry'd out as fast as they could The Earl seeing there was no better way to choose than to retire in all haste But his Gentleman being at some distance as not imagining he would return so soon he was forced to get down without his Assistance so that by a Fall he Wounded his Arm in so much that he thought it had bin broken But though it proved excessive Painful he made all the haste he could to get away from that fatal Place where he had flattred himself to get Sight of his so dearly Beloved Lady He walk'd very fast and sometimes looking behind him would ask his Gentleman whether they were pursued by any body This being overheard by a certain Person that pass'd by accidentally and he believing them to be Thieves gave Notice thereof to the Watch who fell upon and surrounded them before they could make use of their Swords to defend themselves The Leader of the Watch being a Brutish Fellow and Drunk ask'd the Earl who he was from whence he came and where he intended to go It was thought fit to return him no answer  partly out of disdain partly out of necessity not to make a Noise they being as yet but at a little distance from the Garden and they supposed as actually it happened that the Earls of  Anglesey  and  Devonshire  knew by this time there had bin some body seen upon the Wall Besides some going to take a view of the little Gate of the Garden and finding a Key broken within the Lock this caused no small uneasiness in the Family and the Matter being canvass'd over and over the Earl of  Devonshire  discovered somewhat of a Secret Jealousy The poor Countess saw her Projects vanish into Smoak and the necessity of departing rendred her almost inconsolable Besides she durst not discover her Trouble so that though she conceal'd it as much as she could yet there appear'd in her Eyes a certain Emotion which might easily have bin observed  But to return to the Earl of  Warwick  who finding himself surrounded by the Watch thought it his best way to get rid of them by bestowing a good Handful of Money upon the Leader not questioning but that so he might be dismiss'd without being put to the trouble of discovering his Name He had fill'd his Pockets with Gold Pieces he intended for  Albine  but missing of her offer'd them to the Leader of the Watch But his Profusedness proved mischievous to him for this Man now judging they had committed some great Robbery and perceiving him to be Wounded in the Arm and to be very careful in hiding his Face was resolved to detain him it being a Custom here to stop and keep in Custody all such as will not discover themselves if they are met by the Watch in the Night time There are certain Benches fastned on every Corner of  London  Streets to the Walls of the Houses whereon such as are taken upon Suspicion  are to sit with their Legs put thro' certain Holes made in two Boards fitted and joyn'd one above the other a Diversion not very well agreeing with those who are used to more convenient Seats The Earl perceiving what Quarters were prepared for him once more took the Head of the Watch aside and told him That if he would not put him into that Place but let him go he would entrust him with his Name and that he was the Earl of  Warwick  Upon this the Head Officer who did not take Notice of his Garter nor of the Embroidered Star the Knights of that Order always wear upon their Coats not doubting but that he was an Imposture Go  said he  did not I suspect thee before to be a Rogue Thy Impudence to assume the Name of so Great a Man fully convinces me of it And so without hearkning any further to his Discourse he put his Legs into the Stocks with a Resolution to carry both him and his Gentleman to my Lord  Warwick  as soon as it should be daylight  I give you leave to guess at the Confusion he was in upon so odd an Accident Did ever since the beginning of the World  said he to Berincour  happen any Adventure like this I would be tolerably well contented had I but taken my Leave of the Countess but now am so unfortunate as not to be able to see her before she is carry'd into the Country Besides that the Wound I have in my Arm will require some time to be cured so that all the unlucky Accidents seems now to center in mine I defy thee Capricious Fortune  cry'd he  to treat me worse than thou hast done However after some short Reflections  added he  Who is it in all  England  that would not choose to be in my Place and be at this very time where I am now seated upon a  Bench at the Corner of a Street with my Legs put through so many Holes and lock'd close within the Boards And this is the Station those who would wish themselves in my Place must be in in spite of themselves For I can assure you I am here contrary to my Inclinations My Lord  said his Gentleman  this will be over by Daylight and he that could be my Lord  Warwick  upon this Condition would have no ill Bargain of it for the remainder of his Life I know not what you may think of it  said he  as for my Part I would rather choose to be a Porter for he Works all Day and at Night relishes the Pleasures of a sweet Tranquillity more than a General after the gaining of a Battel he has no Master and consequently is under no constraint of pleasing him has he a Mistress he goes to see her without controul he enjoys Health and is never without a good Appetite if his Wife's obstroperous he beats her into good Manners he dreads neither the Great Ones nor the Thieves his Fortune is always in the same Station his Prince knows not whether there be such a Man upon Earth and that Place is the best to him where he can live best Now what Comparison is there betwixt such a Man and a Courtier such as I am Such as you are my Lord  cry'd  Berincour was ever a Man born under a more Fortunate Planet The King stands indebted to you for his Crown and all what he can do for you is below what you have done for him I am nevertheless to be pity'd at this time  reply'd the Earl  and I can't but admire the Capriciousness of Fortune it seems to me as if Caprice and Chance play against one another for us Mortals and that they decide our Fate at their own Pleasure They were thus talking together to divert their Spleen when they heard not far from thence some Body cry out  Murder Watch Help The Watch Gang being not far off run immediately that way and in a moment after brought hither a Man who appear'd to be very refractory  The Earl and his Gentleman not being over curious to see him turn'd away their Faces because they were unwilling to be seen themselves but the Head of the Watch who brought him along told him laughing You will have no reason to be dissatisfy'd with your Company General  Talbot  for here is the Earl of  Warwick  and another Lord who will be glad of your Conversation so you may discourse together of the Court till Day break when I shall have the Honour of seeing you again At these Words he lock'd his Leggs into the Stocks and took his Leave of the Three Prisoners  Whoever thou art  said the Earl of  Warwick  to him  that hast occasion to try the same Fate with mine pray tell me how did'st thou fancy to get out of the Hands of these Myrmidons By telling them you were the General  Talbot  And thou who art so curious and importunate  returns he  what makes thee ask so unseasonable a Question since thou had'st Confidence enough thy self to assume the Name of the Earl of  Warwick  The Earl was so well pleas'd with this Answer that he could not refrain from laughing and his Laughter having something in it that was peculiar and easie to be distinguish'd I now am sensible  continued the Person that spoke before  why thou did'st make Use of his Name because thou laughest very like him Thou art in the right on't  said my Lord Warwick  I have bin often flattered that I was like him and at a Pinch one lays hold of every thing But  continu'd he  tho' thou did'st act by the same Motives as I did pray tell me What made thee imagine thou could'st get  off by taking upon thee the Name of General  Talbot  because there was not the least Probability in this Pretence▪ I made use of the first Name that came into my Head  reply'd the other  I am sorry  said the Earl  you did not pitch upon that of the Earl of  Warwick  as well as my self that we might have seen who had the best Title to it The other Prisoner made no further Answer and the Earl only said with a low Voice to his Gentleman That when the Watch came by the next time they would try once more whether they could get out of this troublesome Place  Whilst they were Discoursing together their Brotherinaffection who having bin overheated and now had had time enough to cool himself began to Cough most violently The Earl heard him not without some Surprize If I have the Laughter of the Earl of  Warwick said he  I am sure thou hast General  Talbot  's Cough Doest thou know him well enough to be a Judge of that reply'd the Man with the Cough▪ No Man that has bin a Soldier can be mistaken in that point  said the Earl  They were thus talking together when the Watch passing by they call'd to them to desire to be conducted to their respective Places of abode You are a Company of Rogues  said their Leader  you are likely to stay here till Daylight but fearing lest something should be defective in the Lock of the Boards wherein their Leggs were enclosed he view'd it narrowly with his Lanthorn At this instant the Prisoners casting their Eyes about knew one another to their utmost surprize on both sides  The Watch being gone they both gave a great Cry at the same time and taking each other by the Hand How Is it you How Is it you  said they  What happened to me  added the General  is past all belief were we alone I would ease my  self in telling you my Adventure You may rest assured  said the Earl  that the third Person here is both Deaf and Dumb when ever I think fit and that is enough to secure you against any thing from him I am so impatient to relate it to you  reply'd the General  that upon your Word I am a going to tell you the whole Story  'You are not unacquainted with that Passion I have bin entangled in for some time pass'd I I say who had kept my self free from it all my Life time before I was not sensible of the Effects it would produce in my Heart and consequently so little feared the Consequences thereof that I cherish'd it as my greatest Happiness 'Tis true the Obstacles I met with to see the Countess of  Devonshire  appear'd to me so full of Difficulty and Trouble that I was resolv'd to cure and despise my Frailty But this unfortunate Painter having in some measure dived into my true Sentiments and found by Experience that a Person of my Temper was the fittest Object of encreasing his Fortune came to me to facilitate as he said every thing for an Interview betwixt the Countess and my self I accepted his Offer and it was agreed he should come in a Coach to my Backgate I went into it without any Attendance being asham'd my Domesticks should have the least Suspicion of my Extravagancy He Conducted me into a Beautiful Garden and thence into a  Grotto  where I saw the Countess of  Devonshire  so full of Tenderness Frankness and Modesty that being seized with the most profound Respect for her Person I thought my self only too Happy She would afford me no other Favours than the Satisfaction of Seeing and Sighing for her and I insisted upon no more for I despise all Women that suffer themselves to be  withdrawn from their Duty And not withstanding that heighth of Passion I had conceived for her I should have shewn nothing but Aversion to her It having at all times bin my Opinion that Vertue and Modesty are the Essential Parts of a Good Woman She questionless had bin acquainted with my Temper and therefore always kept herself within such strict Bounds that she would never allow me the Liberty of touching as much as her Hand unless when I put some Rings with Precious Stones upon her Fingers When I spoke to my Limner concerning her Reservedness he told me in his Country the Ladies were much more Cruel and to speak of an  Italian  Woman and of a Tyger was the same thing I was not good Natur'd enough to be like him but gave him the hearing But to be short my Lord you know I told you this Morning that I was to take my leave of her to Night accordingly I went to the  Grotto  attended by by my old Guide where I found the Countess but in a Moment after saw come in an antient Man follow'd by Four lusty Young Men well Arm'd The Father without taking any Notice of me turning to his Daughter Unfortunate Woman  said he  What could engage thee to Dishonour our Family by thy ill Conduct Art not thou Treated both by thy Mother and my self with all the Tenderness thou couldst expect under thy Circumstances Thy Life shall Pay for the Shame thou hast made us undergo with this drawing his Dagger gave her a Stab before I could put it by though I had my Sword drawn but I Wounded one of the young Fellows who Assaulted me I saw my self immediately Surrounded by the Father and the other three so that I found my self engag'd at great odds  and for whom I give you leave to Guess to wit for an inconsiderable Jilt who so nearly resembled the Countess of  Devonshire  that to find out the real difference betwixt them one must be undeceived in the same manner as I was I thought it therefore my best way to think of Retreating and I can't tell whether they knew me or not But certain it is they were not very pressing upon me to hinder my Retreat Thus I had come off well enough had it not bin for two Old Women who being brought thither by the Noise pursued me so closely with their outcries that the Watch heard it I happened to meet them at the Corner of a Street which I cross'd with much haste tho' I knew not where I was For my Roguish  Italian  who stood Centry for me was run away and in all probability will never appear no more in  London  after the Game he has play'd me But be that as it will I soon saw my self beset on all sides by the Watch and having not much time to consider how to answer those questions they commonly put to those they meet in the Night time I thought it the shortest way to be plain with them  I am such a one  What a cry did they not set up at my Name I know the time when to ingratiate themselves with General  Talbot  they wou'd almost press me to Death and you may now see that in the Place where I am they have almost done so in good earnest'  The Earl would have bin much more Surpriz'd than now he was at this Recital had he not known beforehand that this Woman being a Supposititious Countess of  Devonshire  the unravelling of this Intrigue was not likely to happen without Noise So that being actually prepared against any Surprize he pretended nevertheless  he was and acted his Part to the greatest nicety If you will follow my Advice  said he  I would have you endeavour to cure your self of a Passion which has served hitherto only to torment you and to impair that Great Character unto which you were born 'Tis certain  said the General  I was not made for these sorts of Amusements I am so much asham'd of it that should any Body else but your self my Lord be acquainted with my Frailties I should not be able to endure it You may therefore believe that I shall not seek to nourish those Flames I so much despise As good fortune will have it the true Countess is a going into the Country I am sure I will not go to meet her by the Way And it shall not be my fault if ever I see her again But  continued he  What Chance drew you into this Ambush I need not tell you  reply'd the Earl  you may be sure it was an Assignation Well at least  added the General  I hope you saw the Party you look'd for No  said he  and am besides that much Wounded in the Arm So we have both sufficient cause of Dissatisfaction  reply'd the General  But I wish I was so far a Conjurer as to guess at the Subject and to tell in what Place we now are As to what relates to my self  reply'd the Earl  there needs no Conjurer who deals with Hell or the Devil 'Tis known to every Body long ago that I am much addicted to Adventures Don't you remember what happened to the King and my self whilst he was yet Earl of  Marche  One sweet Night above all the rest being taken up by the Watch we were forc'd to tell our Names but they had too much ill Nature to believe us so they would needs carry us to the very Lodgings of the Dutchess of  York  who tho' she was asleep these Beasts would needs speak with her Here  Madam  said they  take your Son and keep him at home for if we meet him again we shall not bring him hither I remember the thing  said the General  and know this is not your Noviate tho' I confess it is altogether a Novelty to me and should be sorry to the Heart if a Burlesque Account should be given of a thing which is sufficiently ridiculous in it self and in which I have bin engaged in good earnest Let this matter happen as it will  said the Earl  it will do you no harm  Whilst they were thus talking the time away DayLight began to disperce the Darkness of the Night and this increasing their impatience of seeing themselves reliev'd from so ill a Post they were ready to break their Leggs in trying how to get them out The Watch happen'd to come just in the nick of time under the same Leader but attended by another set of Watchmen being upon the point of parting Among these there happen'd to be two who knowing both the General and the Earl very well were ready to drop down for fear having scarce strength enough left to let the Head of the Watch know the fault he had committed The fellow turn'd Pale like one that had receiv'd Sentence of Death and threw himself at their Feet The two Earls seeing him almost desperate told him He should be satisfy'd and take care to open the Lock of the Boards that kept in their Legs and that without any loss of time The poor Fellow was so much frightned that he neither understood them nor remember'd what he had done with the Key at last it was found and that in the very nick of time since otherwise they had bin catch'd in that Place by the Earl of  Devonshire  This Lord more disturb'd by his Jealousy than eas'd by sleep had not bin in Bed all that Night  under pretence of giving the necessary Orders for their Journey Thus he pass'd the greatest part of the Night in a very Ill Humour and rais'd his Motherinlaw and Wife so early out of their Beds that they pass'd through the same Street where the General and the Earl had had their Quarters within a few Minutes after they were dismiss'd The Head of the Watch was still sitting upon the same Bench tearing his Hair like a Madman The Countess of  Anglesey  compassionating his Condition stopp'd the Coach and call'd to him but he refusing to come near them she desir'd the Earl of  Devonshire  who was on Horseback along with them to speak to him since she thought she knew him for he kept the Watch not far from their House Having a little recover'd himself he related to the Earl of  Devonshire  what Misfortune had befall'n him  saying  He look  d upon himself as lost for ever and that he was resolv'd to go out of  England  The Earl could not give Credit to so strange an Adventure and what render'd it quite incredible to him was that General  Talbot  was mention'd in it whom he believ'd to be much wiser than to ramble in the Streets in the Night with the Earl of  Warwick  so that he look'd upon the Fellow as Frenzical He told his Opinion to the Countess of  Anglesey  who thought the same but the young Countess of  Devonshire  knew too well how the matter lay Her Grief encreas'd to a high degree when she understood what had happen'd to the Earl and especially his being Wounded in the Arm She endeavour'd but in vain to conceal it but you might have read in her Eyes the Secret Thoughts of her Heart Her Mother ask'd her what was the matter She told her she was very ill and she being suppos'd to be then with Child there was no further enquiry made at that time  The Earl of  Warwick  had much ado to get home his Leggs were much crampt and his Arm full of Pain but his worst Distemper lay in the Head and Mind He much fear'd that some of the Watchmen would talk of this Accident and that thus the whole Mistery might be unfolded which it was his utmost interest to keep conceal'd The General  Talbot  had a thousand  Chimera  's to struggle withal and being resolv'd not to make any one the Confident of his Troubles he kept the whole closed up within his own Breast However he saw himself freed from the Fetters of the Countess and this Passion had bin sufficiently tormenting to him not to relish the sweet of this new Tranquility In the mean while the Earl of  Warwick  took the departure of the Countess of  Devonshire  so far to Heart that he was forc'd to keep his Bed But what prov'd a great Addition to his Grief was that putting his Hand into his Pocket to feel for a Jewel he had he found it not he guess'd he must either have lost it or else it was stoln out of his Pocket but however it happen'd he was almost desperate about it he order'd  Berincour  to leave no Stone unturn'd to find it out and in the mean while continu'd to be almost beyond himself  The King was no sooner risen but he ask'd for the Earl of  Warwick  so they went to fetch him but being told he had a Feaver the King who lov'd him extreamly was not long before he gave him a Visit in his Lodgings He had already bin inform'd of the departure of the Countess of  Devonshire  by  Albine  whereat being most sensibly afflicted he wanted to talk with the Earl about it At last  said he  they have carry'd away the Countess I am surpriz'd at my self I should relent her Loss after the Usage I have receiv'd from  her and therefore am apt to believe 'tis not her Person so much as the satisfaction of revenging my self which I regret at present Forget her Sir  said the Earl in a Languishing Tone  she is unworthy of your Tenderness and I am sensible she will be sufficiently punish'd in the Country for her Inconstancy in  London  That does not satisfy me  added the King  I will know what it was that made her use me at that rate You had better stay for her return  reply'd the Earl  your Majesty knows then what to do best This delay not suiting the King's impatient Temper and Anger he was sometimes for making her to come back again in a Moment after for going to see her and after all he was for sending his Favourite thither but soon changing his Mind again he was struggling with these different Thoughts for several Days Madam  Grey  was not insensible of this Distraction of his Mind and she was sufficiently inclin'd to make her Complaints to him but was afraid of checking the King's Passion and that being us'd to see her in Tears so often he might not regard them for the future she was of Opinion that nothing could be of more dangerous Consequence to a Mistress and that an unfaithful Lover who takes care to conceal his Infidelity is more likely to return to his former Passion than one who quite breaks off upon that Score Besides that the Earl who had all along animated her Anger was not now so pressing upon that Point For he fear'd no more the King's Progress in this Passion since the departure of my Lady  Devonshire  and now employ'd all his care in settling his own  What Disturbances did he not meet with in his Heart when he consider'd she was not to come back in a considerable time and that there was not the least Opportunity of seeing her but  what must prove very dangerous as well to her as to himself and that they must fear every thing from the Countess of  Anglesey  whose strict Vertue could not permit her to dispence with the most insignificant Frailty in so Dear and Beautiful a Daughter He would often shut himself up in his Closet to abandon himself intirely to the  e melancholy Refections his Grief encreas'd every Day  Albine  writ to him no more he was for trying every thing to see the Countess or at least to send to her his Gentleman whom he knew to want neither Courage nor Conduct but his fear of meeting with some Sinister Accident stop'd his Designs and betwixt these various Irresolutions his Evil rather increas'd than decreas'd  After the Earl of  Devonshire  had left the HeadWatchman before mention  d he travell'd immediately forward to a Wood through which they must pass to  Twittenham  here alighting from his Horse he gave it to a little Page that attended him whilst he walk'd along the great Road with a slow Pace ruminating upon the Thief that had bin seen upon the Wall the broken Key in the Little Gardengate and at last upon the Fancy of the HeadWatchman who believ'd he had taken up the Earls of  Warwick  and  S  op  If he had mention'd only the first  said he  I would not in the least question it but the last of these two has more Wit than to be catch'd in so odd an Adventure As he was frequently looking about to see whether his Motherinlaw's Coach follow'd him he observ'd something that cast a more than ordinary Lustre in his Page's Hands Drawing nearer to him he saw it was a large Jewel of Gold set all over with precious Stones a Piece he had often seen in the Earl of  Warwick  's Hands He enquir'd not without some disturbance from the Page where he had it He told him frankly  That he being one of the first who got into the Street after the Thief had bin seen upon the Wall the Lustre of this Piece made of Gold and cover'd with Diamonds had made him look that way and perceiving what it was he thought he might take and keep it The Earl took it and looking upon it for a considerable time it at last seem'd to him of that thickness as to contain a double Bottom he try'd to open it with a sort of uneasiness whereof he already began to suspect the cause and being gone at some distance from the Page at last open'd and found enclos'd within it the Picture of his Lady with these Words Engraven round about it  She is much better in my Heart  At this fatal Sight he turn'd Pale he shiver'd his Soul was expos'd a Prey to the most cruel Reflections that could be He lov'd my Lady  Devonshire  he was sometimes inclin'd to justify her but could not accomplish it For  said he  the Master of this Jewel must doubtless be the same Person who having got a Key to the LittleGate of the Garden was endeavouring to open it but finding it broken in the Lock scaladed the Wall and afterwards run away and the Jewel more than sufficiently shews it must be the Earl of  Warwick  What could he think after so many convincing Proofs especially since the Picture of his Lady fell into his Hands by so extraordinary an Accident He was a going to abandon himself quite to Despair when hearing the Noise of my Lady  Anglesey  's Coach he Remounted his Horse and spoke only a few Words as they pass'd by him being resolv'd to hide his Grief till he had Discours'd her about the Matter The little Page vex'd to the Heart that his Master had kept the Jewel could not forbear to speak of it to  Albine  whose Kinsman he was and he extoll'd to such a  degree the Value thereof that the old Covetous Governess was heartily vex'd thereat since she would fain have bin Mistress of it her self let the Consequences have prov'd never so dangerous So soon as she had an Opportunity of speaking to her Mistress she told her of this unfortunate Accident and never were so many prevailing Circumstances join'd together to discover any Man as there were here against the Earl of  Warwick  Am I not to be pity'd  said she to  Albine that my Compliance with thy Advice should cost me all the Tranquillity of my Life What was it that mov'd me to consent that the Earl should take his Leave of me Heavens are my Witness that notwithstanding my Inclinations for him I would not save his Life by one Criminal Sigh and ever since that fatal Moment when I saw him first I have left nothing unattempted to put him out of my Mind but finding my self not in a Condition to encompass that I have always stood upon my Guard to observe my self being sensible that my Heart was only too much inclin'd to him  Albine  What hast thou done when thou did'st persuade me to entertain him This so Charming and at the same time so Dangerous Sight made such an Impression upon my Soul as encreas'd all my Pains I suffer'd before upon his Account Was not I unfortunate enough unless you had taken so much pains to speak to me concerning him Why did'st thou find out an Opportunity to bring him into the House His Jewel being now in my Husband's Hands is there any room for him to doubt but that what the HeadWatchman told him is actually true He will for the future look upon me only with Scorn and the secret Reproaches I shall load my self withal will serve only to make him discover the Confusion I  am in You must not Madam  said  Albine  to her  torment your self at that rate it will be no hard Task for you to persuade your whole Family that if the Earl had attempted to come into the Garden it must be by the King's Command and without the least Knowledge of yours and that the Ingenious Confession you have made concerning his Majesty's Sentiments ought to be a convincing Proof that you had not the least share in all that had happen'd No  cry'd the Countess  I can't maintain a Lye with the same Confidence as I did the Truth my Mother will read in my Eyes all what is within me Alas could she as well discover there my Innocence and Misfortunes What is it I need then to fear Whilst the young Countess was thus afflicting her self the Earl of  Devonshire  full of Impatience to impart the Secret to my Lord and my Lady  Anglesey  took them into a remote Walk and having discover'd to them what real cause of Suspicion he had of his Wife he shew'd them her Picture within the Jewel of the Earl of  Warwick  The Sight thereof overwhelm'd them with Grief they found it very difficult to speak in her Justification but after all my Lady  Anglesey  could not resolve to condemn her without being hear'd so she desir'd her Soninlaw not to take the least notice of it to her till she had Discours'd the Point with her which was to be done the next following Day  My Lady  Devonshire  soon perceiv'd that when my Lady  Anglesey  lock'd her self up with her in a Room this was the time she was to undergo the Tryal of a most severe Inquisition She trembled and the Paleness of her Face was an undeniable Token of her disturb'd Thoughts After having patiently endur'd a thousand Reproaches without in the least interrupting the Countess When she  saw her Picture within the Jewel she could no longer hear with patience her Mother upbraiding her with having presented it to the Earl she fell out into such a Passion and spoke upon that Head with so much vehemency tho' without losing the respect due to her Mother that she began to be fully convinc'd of her Innocence My Lady  Anglesey  now fully satisfy'd of the Truth of what her Daughter had told her promis'd to omit nothing that might conduce to make the Earl of  Devonshire  to have a favourable Opinion of her The Countess begg'd with Tears in her Eyes to do her what service she could with her Lord she was several times in a Mind to desire the favour of her to dismiss  Albine  but fearing lest this malicious old Creature might still more exasperate the Earl of  Devonshire  against her by putting into his Head certain Malicious Constructions concerning her Easiness in consenting to an Interview with him during her Father's and Husband's Journey to  York  and consequently make the Breach wider this prov'd the only Motive that made her keep near her a Monster which could not be kept at too great a distance  My Lady  Angelsey  not only urg'd the matter home and with extraodinary strength of Reason to her Sonin law but also engag'd her Word for his Wives Innocence all the Fault being laid upon the King And it was true in effect that my Lady  Devonshire  knew nothing of the Mistery of this Jewelcase and that no Body could have shew'd more Dissatisfaction than she did at the Earl of  Warwick  upon that Point For she would often say to  Albine  What must the Limner think who drew this Picture he will certainly believe this Favour was obtain'd with my Consent O Unfortunate I  cry'd she  what was I a doing when I had so much Complaisance as to hearken to the  Earl How dearly am I likely to pay for it I shall lose my Husband's Esteem he will from hence forward be always inclin'd to Jealousy which all my Precaution and good Conduct will not be able to remove Oh What signifies it to you Madam if he is jealous  said  Albine provided you have nothing wherewith to reproach your self If you have committed an Error in something or other you may give a free course to your Tears But supposing the Earl of  Warwick  had your Picture there is nothing blameable in your regard in the Case Are not the Pictures of Soveraigns seen every where And don't they even make Presents of them without being blam'd for it These general Instances have no relation to my particular Case  reply'd she  a Queen may do abundance of things which are innocent in her would be interpreted as Criminal in me I am neither so Blind nor so Foolhardy as to regulate my self by such like Examples Then you have now conceiv'd a Hatred against the Earl  said  Albine Were I come to that Point of Hating him  reply'd she  I should not be disturb'd to that degree as I am but there is still a certain Remembrance and that so dear to me that it follows me every where I feel still within me a Frailty not to hate him and am in vain upon my Guard against my own Heart nothing but Time and Absence can cure me  My Lady  Devonshire  understood by the Countess of  Anglesey  all what had pass'd betwixt her and her Soninlaw Your Conduct for the future  said she to her  must make good every thing I have engag'd for For my Dear Child I had rather see you dead than to find you bewitch'd to the best Man in the World As I am of the same Opinion with you  reply'd she  the greatest favour you can do me is to let me live in the Country I will  avoid the King I will fly the World and I will avoid every thing that may robb me of this Happy Tranquillity and may make me to displease you My Lady  Anglesey  embracing her with a great deal of Tenderness  told her  she highly approv'd her Resolution That it would be necessary to keep at a distance from Court for some time and that the King would certainly forget her But  added she  has the Earl of  Warwick  no share in the Intrigue Is it possible he should so far expose himself as to get on the top of the Gardenwall to suffer himself to be seiz'd by the Watch and run the Hazard of so many ill Consequences that attended it barely to be serviceable to his Master He who a long time ago was always us'd to follow his own Inclinations and not to obey the King's Commands any further than he found them suitable to his own satisfaction Add to this your Picture in his Jewelcase if it was the King's what made him keep it 'Tis possible Madam  reply'd the Countess not without some Confusion seeing her Mother's Head so full of Jealousy  'tis possible the King might stand in fear of his Mistresses Curiosity to avoid which he gave it to his Favourite The old Countess seem'd well enough satisfy'd with this Reason and going out of her Chamber left the Daughter in her Closet entangled in a thousand Vexations  Ought it not have bin sufficient for me  said she to her Confident  to obey with submission without going about to give Counsel against my own Tranquillity I desire to live in the Country all the remainder of my Life to be watch'd and to be debarr'd from all manner of Liberty If they do accordingly How can I complain And if it be done Why should I live That cruel Dart that has Wounded me still sticks in the very innermost part of my Heart and I shall see no more  him whom I am not able to forget  Albine  how unfortunate am I She cry'd for a considerable time and her Governess who long'd for nothing more than to be always managing an Intrigue whereby she might make her Advantage did not fail to make Use of this Critical Juncture to propose to her to give an Account in a Letter to the Earl in what a Condition she was in The Countess not only rejected her Proposition but also forbid her ever to recall to her Mind an Idea she intended to efface out of her Remembrance  The Departure of the Countess of  Devonshire  had at first rais'd the King's Anger but hearing her scarce ever spoken of and believing himself not well us'd he made all his Addresses to Madam  Grey  who became so intoxicated and haughty at this unexpected return of the King's Passion that without the least Regard to her best Friends she sacrific'd every thing to her own Humour and Interest as among the rest it happen'd to the Earl of  Warwick  The Head of the Watchmen who had made the Earl to pass his time so scurvily in the late Nocturnal Adventure dreaded the Consequence thereof might turn to his utter Ruin unless he could counterballance the Earl's Authority by some powerful Protection at Court His Sister happening to live with Madam  Grey  he told her the whole Story and what Apprehensions he was under And this young Woman fearing no less than the Ruin of her Brother by the great Power of the General and the Earl threw her self at her Mistresses Feet conjuring her to take Compassion of her Family and to interceed with the King in behalf of what had happen'd to her Brother out of Ignorance Madam  Grey  was too well pleas'd with this Story not to impart it to  the young King and to represent the whole under such Circumstances of her own Invention as prov'd very diverting to him After having laugh'd very heartily for some time he was very curious to know from whence the General and the Earl came at that time of Night and as he knew the first to be a Person of downright Honesty he judg'd he might with much less Difficulty unfold the Mistery by him than by the Earl of  Warwick  who would be sure not to discover his Intrigue to him  So soon as the King saw the General he took him into his Closet and told him with a very obliging Air That he was somewhat dissatisfy'd with him because he should keep him in Ignorance of what was known to all the World besides  viz  his Quarrel with the Watch If you have a mind to make your Peace with me  continued he  you must deal frankly and let me know at least from whence you came at that time Sir  reply'd the General  your Majesty would have put me to the greatest Nonplus that can be had you ask'd me such a Question as this sometime ago but at this time now I have broken those Chains that prov'd too weighty for me and am freed from a Tyrannical Passion so little suitable to my Natural Inclinations I am free to own that the most surprizing Beauty of the young Countess of  Devonshire  did rob me of the true Use of all my Reason He then like a blunt truebred Soldier laid open before the King his whole Passion for that Lady his Inquietudes and how he had bin manag'd by the Limner but dissembled his Knowledge of the King's being his Rival judging that in point of Policy he ought not to touch upon that String The King interrupting him told him with a Smile Oh my Lord you forget to remember me in this Love  Concern The General was somewhat surpriz'd but soon recollecting himself Your Majesty  says he  knows so well how to conceal the Secrets of your Heart that I could never be acquainted with what share your Majesty had in this Intrigue We will ask  Rosamond  's Picture  continu'd the King Smiling  perhaps she will be more sincere than we are The General being not a little netled Blush'd Sir  said he  the sincere Confession I have made without concealing the least thing from you I hop'd would not have bin recompenc'd with such Reproaches from your Majesty I am much asham'd of it and you will actually save me a great deal of Trouble if you will be pleas'd to believe That that time whilst I was sighing for my Lady  Devonshire  is to me now like a Dream the Idea whereof vanishes as soon as you are well awake as I don't remember what is pass'd so I might easily forget to mention some Circumstances without the least design That this must be attributed rather to the Defect of my Memory than to any want of Inclination to give entire Satisfaction to your Majesty concerning what you are desirous to know Well let that be as it will  reply'd the King  tell me whether the Earl of  Warwick  was along with you at this charming Assignation No Sir  said the General  we were both equally surpriz'd to meet one another at this pretty Seat nay we talk'd together for some Moments without knowing one another and I could with all the eagerness I shew'd not get out of him a Reciprocal Confidence to tell me from whence he came  The King who listen'd to him with much Attention began to conceive some Jealousy at the Earl of  Warwick  but would not give way to it for fear of giving to himself some real occasion of Trouble His Tenderness for the Earl did  suppress his Jealousy and he would even have bin dissatisfy'd with being inform'd of the real Truth thereof so that his mind fluctuating betwixt uncertain Hope and Fear he did not in the least alter his obliging manner of Correspondence with this Favorite But the Earl whose Passion encreas'd in Proportion to the Multitude of Obstacles that obstructed his Happiness could think of nothing else than how to encompass another Interview with the Countess of  Devonshire  and as he took but little notice of those that came to make their Court to him so the King found him much different in his Temper from that Pleasant Charming and Engaging Humour which render'd him so agreeable to all the World He observ'd not without Vexation that not only his Deportment but also his Person was much chang'd That his Spirits seem'd suppress'd That his Health was but in an indifferent State and in short That his Pensiveness and Distractions carry'd him beyond himself sometimes past all recovery He was heartily disturb'd thereat and it came more than once into his Thoughts that perhaps the Earl might have bin wanting in the Respect and Fidelity due to him in respect of my Lady  Devonshire  and that he secretly lov'd her But as I told you before he would check these Considerations and continue to give him such Demonstrations of his Tenderness as would have made him esteem himself infinitely Happy had his Heart not bin engag'd so far as it was  One Day when the King had bin Talking to him a long while concerning a Matter that acquir'd a great deal of Attention being the Subject upon which he was to make a Speech to the Parliament the better to help his Memory he  thought fit to dictate it to the Earl for him to write it but happening to stop at certain Intervals the better to think upon what he was to dictate upon that Head the Earl who was so far from thinking upon what the King said that he minded nothing else but his own Affairs meaning the Countess was on a sudden seiz'd with some Splenetick Thoughts which nearly affecting his Soul he without considering that the Paper he had in his Hand must be perus'd by the King himself writ these following Words Hymen  has reduc'd you under the Laws of a Husband your Heart is his and 'tis not in your Power to lo  e a Lover  He had questionless gone on had not the King begun afresh so that the Earl making a new Article writ what was dictated to  and stopping again for a while to ruminate upon the Matter and to render his Speech the more persuasive and insinuating the Earl who was quite taken up with the Countess writ again these Lines  Love not a Husband whose dreadful Power does snatch from thee thy Heart in spite of thy self and who without consulting thy Heart offers Violence to thy Inclinations  The King concluded the Speech which the Earl writ without considering it was upon the same Paper where he had set down these Verses and it being late his Majesty folding it up without reading it and putting it up in his Pocket went to pay a Visit to the Dutchess of  York  his Mother The Earl of  Warwick  went home at the same time from whence he sent immediately a Messenger to the Dutchess of  Norsolk  Sister to the Countess of  Devonshire  He knew that this Lady was then enquiring for a Compleat Gardener for the Countess of  Anglesey  who now wholly applying her self to the Diversions of the Country had a mind to have their Gardens quite alter'd The  Earl of  Warwick  having then a House or rather to speak more properly a Palace at  Chelsey  near  London  adorn'd with all the Beauties of Art and Nature especially by its most Delightful Situation upon the very Bank of the  Thames  he spar'd no Cost nor Care to make it one of the most Charming Places in the World It was for this Purpose he had obtain'd out of  France  the Designs and Scheme of that celebrated Gardener who had the Management of those Famous Gardens of  Agnes Lorez  Mistress to King  Charles  VII of  France  appertaining to a fine Country Seat near  Vincennes  Two Gardeners being likewise sent him out of  France  to be employ'd in the Designing of his Gardens he sent one of them to the Dutchess of  Norsolk  to shew her the Draughts they had brought along with them The Gardener being a sensible Fellow so well discharg'd himself of his Commission according to the Earl's Instructions that my Lord  Norfolk  soon agreed with him to be sent to my Lady  Anglesey  and the Gardener desiring to have a Fellow allow'd him to assist him she willingly consented to his Request This Employment being design'd for  Berincour  a Native of  France  his Language perfectly suited with his Master's Intention but it was not the same with his Habit for being very well known at Court where he us'd frequently to attend the Earl and of a Gentile Make it was not an easie matter to manage his Disguise so as to be past all hazard of being discover'd However this Point being encompass'd almost to a Wonder away he goes along with the Gardener to execute his Master's Commission and to deliver a Letter to the Countess of  Devonshire  full of those most Respectful and Passionate Expressions that were due to a Lady of her Merit and Birth and  suitable to represent his Passion in the most lively Terms that could be invented  The King staid not long with the Dutchess his Mother but soon having engag'd her at Play wherein he went Halves with her soon left the Apartment and straightways went to that of Madam  Grey  who gave him a slender Check for staying so long Don't be out of Humour  said he to her  I have bin busie in very serious Matters and I staid but a very little while with the Dutchess of  York  because I would be here so soon as possible I could I will read to you the Speech I intend to make at the opening of the next Parliament because I have had no time to peruse and revise it as yet I hope Sir  said she Caressing him  you will read it aloud which the King did but coming to that Passage where the Earl had witten his Verses he was surpriz'd beyond Expression What do you think of this  said he to his Mistress  Is it by chance or done on purpose Who is it he speaks of and who is it he is so much in love with Madam  Grey  read them with the utmost Attention and without consulting a Conjurer soon guess'd at the true meaning thereof Oh Traytor  cry'd she  he intended to make me his Bubble The King was touch'd to the quick with these Words for knowing Madam  Grey  to be one of the most  able Persons in the World he suspected an Intrigue betwixt her and the Earl so that at last his Passion for the Countess of  Devonshire  was reviv'd Quite overwhelm'd with these Thoughts he with a fierce Countenance look'd upon the Fair Widow without sparing all the Reproaches his Rage could inspire him with or affording her any time for her Justification and so arising on a sudden from his Seat was a going to leave her she then throwing  her self at his Feet and Embracing him with Tears in her Eyes  I am resolv'd  said she  not to live unless your Majesty will hear me Sir I am not Guilty The Words which I let drop without considering the matter concerning the Earl of  Warwick  have not the least relation to me but only to his Treachery to you  At these Words the King's Anger seem'd to be somewhat appeas'd the Beautiful Eyes of Madam  Grey  all overflown with Tears had touch'd him to the quick and he now blam'd himself for being the Occasion thereof so he sat down again and Madam  Grey  laying hold of this favourable Disposition with tender Looks intermix'd with Sighs told him I was unacquainted Sir with your Passion for the Countess of  Devonshire  and I might have bin so for a great while longer had not the Earl of  Warwick  taken so much Pains to inform me of it by many of his Letters I am a going to shew to your Majesty it was he also that told me you intended to fetch her from  Twittenham  and thus I acted in concert with him in order to thwart your Design 'Twas he that plagu'd me to load you with Reproaches and without him I should have shew'd much more Tenderness and Respect but when he told me I was upon the point of losing you I like a desperate Woman was soon persuaded that he had so much respect for me as to be altogether in my Interest and that this was the only Motive that made him hazard every thing in trusting me with a Secret the Discovery whereof would in all probability make him forfeit all your Favours I would have conceal'd it within my Breast were it not that now I am convinc'd what was it that engag'd him to make me his Confident wherein Affection had not the least Share 'Tis so far from it Sir that he should have a Passion for me that he loves the Countess of  Devonshire  he is your  Rival and I his Shield to be interpos'd betwixt you and her in order to Cure your old Passion by a new one Don't disdain to call to mind his Conduct when you laid open your Heart to him look into these Letters reflect upon these Verses  Hymen  has reduc'd you under the Laws of a Husband your Heart is his and 'tis not in your Power to love a Lover  You see Sir  said she  how every thing agrees to what I tell you He thinks the Countess loves her Husband That he fears he shall never obtain her That this touches him to the Heart and That thereupon he has scarce any regard to what your Majesty dictated to him but overcome by his Passion he writes those very things he had much better have kept secret and that upon the same Paper you have now in your Hands nay you see him carry'd to such a Pitch of Extravagancy that he goes on and Writes these Lines  Love not a Husband whose dreadful Power does snatch from thee thy Heart in spite of thy self and who without consulting thy Heart offers Violence to thy Inclinations  This doubtless is said in relation to the Countess's sudden Departure he knowing her to be dissatisfy'd upon that Point like a Man of Sense makes Use of this as an Argument to cool her Affection for her Husband Now your Majesty sees  continu'd she  how little I deserv'd these Reproaches you loaded me with to so high a Degree and how small a Share of Affection the Earl bore to me She might have held on Talking thus till Night without being minded by  the King who soon perceiving that his Jealousy was illgrounded and this his Jealousy changing to a most furious Anger continu'd all this while  a deep study Madam  Grey  being too well acquainted with the cause thereof to interrupt him in his Thoughts kept silence for a while till the King broke out on a sudden as if he was speaking to the Earl  O Perfidious Man Is this the Return thou makest me for all the Kindness I have shown thee for the entire Confidence I have put in thee for the Riches and other Favours I have heap'd upon thee What a Piece of Treachery is this He has snatch'd from me a young Mistress whom I lov'd and unto whom I was not altogether indifferent He has left no Stone unturn'd Madam to rob me likewise of your Heart Could any Letters be more cunningly devis'd than these he has written to you How Miserable is the Condition of Princes being either hated out of Fear or else despis'd when they enter into a Familiarity with their Subjects so that they scarce ever taste the true Relish of thinking themselves really belov'd  He paus'd at these Words a little and his Melancholly Reflections encreasing with the Considerations of what Favours he had bestow'd upon the Earl and how ill he had bin rewarded by him he Sigh'd much dissatisfy'd within himself for retaining still some Kindness for a Person that deserv'd it so little At last turning his Eyes with a tender Look upon Madam  Grey  he begg'd of her not to remember what he had told her during the first Motions of his Jealousy she appear'd satisfy'd thereat but was not a little discompos'd at the King's Melancholly which she endeavour'd to disperse by her pleasant and engaging Conversation which at any other time but this would have bin very diverting to him but now had but little if not a contrary Effect upon him for he  took his Leave of her not without some dissatisfaction because she had laid open to him the ill Conduct of his Favourite  The Earl of  Warwick  appear'd not at Court that Night being wholly taken up with making the necessary Dispositions for  Berincour  's Journey he open'd no less than three times the Letter he was to deliver to the Countess of  Devonshire  making every time certain Additions and so many superfluous Repetitions as took away a great part of its first Beauty He also sent a Letter to  Albine  and a Jewel of a good Value and yet after all was not contented with what he had either written or done fearing less some sinister Accident or other should disconcert all his Precautions or that the Countess of  Devonshire  might be exasperated at his Proceeding  The King pass'd that Night under a thousand Inquietudes which would not suffer him so much as to think of sleeping the Beauty Grace and Engaging Air of the Countess of  Devonshire  coming a fresh into his Mind tormented his Soul with an irresistable Power He understood by the Verses of the Earl's that he had not as yet made any sufficient Progress there to make him Happy and on the other Hand reflecting upon his late Conduct he had all the reason to fear he should not be more Happy himself Entangled in these different Considerations his Passion at last gave place to his Anger on account of the Earl of  Warwick  He took a Resolution to Banish him into the most  Northern Parts  of  Scotland  among those dreadful Mountains where the Inhabitants at that time were distinguishable only from Savage Beasts by their Human Shape  Here it is  said he  where he shall entertain the Rocks with his Passion here he shall send forth his Sighs to the Sea whilst I will remain Deaf to all his Complaints till I have  made him to do a long Penance for his Infidelity  But after all considering the many Obligations he ow'd him this oblig'd him to alter his Opinion and to make him acknowledge only and repent of his Fault However whilst he continu'd struggling betwixt Gratitude and Anger for fear the last should again get the upper hand against a Person whom he was inclin'd to Pardon if he would in the least render himself worthy of it he resolv'd rather than to speak to him himself to engage some Body else to do it in his behalf  He pitch'd upon the Earl of  Pembroke  to undertake this Task He was also the King's Favourite a Man not inferior in Point of Magnificence and Gallantry to any Person at Court he was Witty of a Charming Conversation Young Handsome and who spar'd nothing to render himself agreeable to the Fair Sex and that with good Success The King having order'd him to be call'd to Court early in the Morning he was yet in Bed but made all the haste he could being impatient to know what the King had to command him He was no sooner admitted into his Bed Chamber but he told him Your best Friend has betray'd me The Earl of  Warwick  never merited the Tenderness I shew'd him I made him a Partaker in my Heart but my Favours were very ill bestow'd The Earl of  Pembroke  hearken'd to the King with a great deal of Trouble because he entirely lov'd the Earl of  Warwick  What is it you tell me Sir  cry'd he  Is it possible he should be wanting in what is owing to so Great a King Certainly he was not engag'd in restoring King  Henry  and Queen  Margarete  to the Throne Ah I don't doubt but that some body or other envious of his Good Fortune has insinuated something to your Majesty to procure his Ruin Believe your own Eyes  reply'd the King  giving him  the Billets he had written to Madam  Grey  and his Speech with the before mention'd Verses The Earl stood surpriz'd to the highest Degree with his Eyes fix'd to the Ground without uttering one Word I am well pleas'd  said the King  to see you so much concern'd there being but few Favourites so generous as to share the Misfortunes of those whom they think powerful enough to do them a Mischief but since you are so much concern'd for him Go and advise him to merit his Pardon by an Ingenuous Confession of his Intrigue with the young Countess of  Devonshire  this being the only Means to appease my Anger I am a going to conduct him hither at your Majesty's Feet  answer'd the Earl  No  cry'd the King  let him shew never so much Repentance I will not speak to him and I could find in my Heart never to see him again but rather to send him into some dreadful Solitude where he might at his own leisure reflect upon his Fault but that some Remnants of Tenderness plead within me for his better Treatment In short let him be sincere and he may be sav'd  The Earl of  Pembroke  went immediately to the Earl of  Warwick  but so much overwhelm'd with Grief as is scarce to be express'd To give the Reader the better Idea of the true Occasion thereof I shall be oblig'd to give an Account of the Whole Adventure from its first Original  'The Earl of  Pembroke  after his Return from  Rome  where he had spent some Months into  England  receiv'd the Visits of many Persons of Note and among the rest of my Lord  Stanley  Brother to the Countess of  Devonshire  This Lord took notice in the Earl's Apartment of a certain most curious Picture representing  Psyche  in a  most magnificent Palace said to be Built for her by  Cupid  adorn'd with all the Embellishments that could be invented nothing could appear more lovely than this young Princess her self in short she was such as might inspire Love to love it self My Lord  Stanley  was so much taken with the Picture that not being able to keep his Eyes from it he shorten'd his Visit and return'd home with a full Resolution to have the Picture cost what it would tho' he could not well devise how to encompass it they being Rivals and consequently not overcomplaisant for one another They both made love to a very Charming Actress named  Lelia  who having always shewn more Inclination for my Lord  Stanley  than for my Lord  Pembrook  occasion'd this Jealousy betwixt them My Lord  Stanley  rightly judg'd that  Lelia  might easily get the Picture from a Person who had always distinguish'd himself by his Generosity and who would not refuse her such a thing even tho' he had not bin in Love with her My Lord was not backward in caressing and telling his Mistress every thing he could think of in case she could get the Picture so both mov'd by joint Interest and Inclination Mrs  Lelia  had the Picture from the Earl as soon as she ask'd for it She scarce gave her self leisure to cast her Eyes upon it being highly impatient to satisfy my Lord  Stanley  's Curiosity with all possible Diligence in which she had succeeded to her Desire had it not bin for a sinister Accident that interven'd'  'My Lord  Pembrook  happening to return my Lord  Stanley  's Visit happen'd just to be in the Room when Mrs  Lelia  's Messenger came in with the Picture being eager to deliver it in hopes of a good Present so that tho' my Lord made him a Sign of going back with it as soon guessing it was the Picture of the Beautiful  Psyche  the Fellow  open'd the Coverture and expos'd it to the Earl of  Pembrook  's Sight who appear'd not a little nettled thereat They both Blush'd together my Lord appear'd surpriz'd and the Earl smil'd with a malicious Air I should have bin vex'd  said he  if I should have seen my Picture in another Place but I think it but reasonable that  Lelia  should amuse you by such like small Presents when I have reason to believe that she bestows upon me other Favours of much more Value than yours I am not surpriz'd at what you tell me  reply'd my Lord  I always thought you more Happy than my self and even your Absence has not bin able to procure to me the least Advantage with her The Earl who knew very well how the Matter stood soon put an End to the Conversation wherein he could take but small delight and going straightways to  Lelia  overloaded her with a thousand Reproaches according to her Deserts to all which she answer'd with Indifferency she having conceiv'd a certain Opinion That if any thing could fix that erring Star or Planet of my Lord  Stanley  's it would be this Sacrifice she had offer'd to him'  'About that time all the Discourse in  London  was concerning that Stupendious Structure the Earl of  Warwick  was a Building at  Chelsey  Every one found out some new Embellishments and Beauties in it every Day and there were very few but what would go to take a View of it before he had Lodg'd there some of his Beautiful Mistresses and consequently render'd it inaccessible He had a great Number of Workmen there but at the same time seldom came there himself being obliged constantly to attend the King'  'The Earl of  Pembrook  vex'd to the Heart at  Lelia  without being able to Cure himself of his Passion for her resolv'd to make this a retiring  Place to indulge his Grief After having walk'd for a considerable time he seated himself on the Bank of a Rivulet which flowing through the Green Fields over a Sandy Bottom and being curiously planted with many large Trees near the edge made this Place both very Shady and Refreshing in the hot Season looking upon this Place as very suitable to his present Circumstances he past some time in a very pensive Condition till at last he writ certain Verses in his  Tablebook  he happening then to hear the Voices of divers Persons coming that Way he got up and being resolv'd not to be seen by them mov'd from them with so much haste that none of them could perceive him near hand tho' they guess'd by his Habit that he must be a Person of Quality These prov'd a Company of Ladies who soon saw themselves not mistaken in their Guess when the Countess of  Devonshire  who walk'd a few Paces before the rest saw upon the Ground a  Tablebook  the outside whereof was Plated with and Engraven in Gold set at the Edges with Diamonds of a considerable Value'  'The Countess of  Anglesey  committed her Daughter to the Care of the Countess of  Oxford  to take her along with her to  Chelsey  in Company of the Countess of  Bath  Mrs  Howard  and my Lord  Stanley  they being all satisfy'd that the Earl of  Warwick  was gone abroad a Hunting with the King The Countess of  Devonshire  shew'd them the fine  Tablebook  but finding it fastned with a very small Lock and no Key in it there was no possibility of opening it unless they would break it all to Pieces They were all inclin'd to do it except my Lord  Stanley  who oppos'd it alledging That without doubt he that own'd and had lost it would soon come to enquire after it so the Countess of  Devonshire  kept it After  they had taken several turns my Lord  Stanley  told his Sister and Mrs  Howard  with a low Voice That they would turn into another Walk and no sooner had they done so but he ask'd for the  Tablebook  I have  added he  a small Key which I believe will open it I would not discover the thing to the rest of the Ladies because if I am not mistaken I have some Share in the Secret But I will remain Mistress of it  said his Sister with a Smile  and therefore can do no more for your satisfaction than to make Use of it and as I take a singular Delight in unfolding of Misteries so I should be much pleas'd to meet with a Diverting Secret When they open'd it they found the following Lines upon the first Leaf'  The Object of my Love is offensive to me I was not able to engage her I will be for Change 'tis a Pleasure to Revenge ones self by a happy Indifference  'Our Unknown is dissatisfy'd with his Condition  said the Countess of  Devonshire  laughing  but he takes his own Way and I suppose he is happy in his Liberty by this time Ah Madam  reply'd Mrs  Howard that is no sure Rule I have heard People talk upon that Head who have found themselves more than once in their Life time put to such Tryals they were free to own that the Wounds of the Heart are far different from others and prove very hard to be cur'd I conjure you Brother  said the Countess of  Devonshire  turning to my Lord  Stanley tell us in good earnest your Thoughts upon this Point I am afraid I shall speak against the Fair Sex and thus you intend to expose me to the Indignation of the most Aimable Person in the  World  said he  looking upon Mrs  Howard  You can't say nothing amiss in what you are a going to tell my Lord  said she  I have already conceiv'd such an Opinion of you as with all the Art you have you will not be able to alter I will tell you then  continu'd he  you are under a great Mistake if you imagine that People fix their Love now for any considerable time they tell us indeed That in former Ages People were absolutely True and Faithful That let their Fetters be never so heavy they worship'd them whether well or ill treated it was no matter they lov'd many Years successively without being able to make their Reason so far to get the upper hand of their Passion as to incline to a Change But at present we take quite contrary Methods to those and such as prove much more Commodious commonly the Person that Changes first is scarce a few Moments beforehand with the other he has lov'd we now love our Mistresses as Butterflies do Flowers If a loving Couple now part without falling quite to Pieces and exposing themselves to the Publick they say they have done the finest thing they could do and that they ought not to be dissatisfy'd with one another'  'If I had the least Inclination for an Intrigue  said Mrs  Howard this Discription of yours would cure me of it for all my Life time There is no General without an Exception  reply'd my Lord  and I my self Madam dare undertake to be one of the first who can give you an Instance that there are even now those who know how to love at another rate than what I just now spoke of I can't tell whether you can or not  added she  but this I am sure of I shall make no Tryal thereof Look here  said the Countess interrupting her  some more Verses let us see  whether they are of the same Stamp with the preceeding ones'  Lelia  is Prodigal of her Charms in the Arms of a Triumphant Rival Ah Let us take revenge let us hasten to sacrifice her before his Eyes But alas how many Tears will this Fury of mine cost me by delivering up what I love to my most Cruel Despair But no matter let us revenge our selves since this Inhumane Creature has not as much as vouchsafed to make one Step to allay my Pain and Despair  'The Countess being not ignorant that her Brother was in Love with  Lelia  she told him with a kind of a Malicious Smile you were in the right to concern your self so far as you did in what might be contain'd in this  Tablebook  you see it complains of your Mistress But is it you that is the Occasion of it or is your Condition no better than that of this Unfortunate Lover You reveal my Secrets without my Consent  reply'd he  And what would Mrs  Howard  think of me if I should say I had reason to be contented She would interpret it perhaps as a Piece of Vanity The Person you speak of my Lord is not so very valuable for her Conduct  reply'd she  from thence to inferr the least Disadvantagious Consequence in boasting of your Happiness Tis true  said he  People have conceiv'd some Prejudice against her Conduct but notwithstanding this what she does for me deserves Acknowledgment For she prefers me to the Earl of  Pembrook  who you know has generally the Preference before most of the other Courtiers He then told them what had happen'd concerning the Picture of  Psyche  Truly Brother  said the Countess  I begin to fear the Consequence of this Affair he seems to me most furiously  angry and as doubtless he will come this way to look for his  Tablebook  so if he finds you here it will prove an additional Trouble to him I conjure you by our Friendship to leave us and I will go back to the Countess of  Oxford  and desire her not to tell him who I am And do you think he does not know you  said Mrs  Howard No  added the Countess  I come so seldom to Court that if he has seen me at all I dare say he does not remember me My Lord  Stanley  desir'd his Sister to be satisfy'd which she promis'd she would provided he would stay no longer with them He was no sooner gone but she told Mrs  Howard  I think I did not amiss in not suffering the Earl of  Pembrook  to have the Dissatisfaction of meeting with a Happy Rival who is the Subject of his Complaints in these Verses Mrs  Howard  commended her Prudence telling her That she should have bin afraid of a Quarrel betwixt them'  'In the mean while the said Earl having not without much Inquietude discover'd the Loss of his  Tablebook  he hasten'd back to the Place from whence he came and where he made Use of it but not finding it there and not questioning but that the Ladies whom he endeavour'd to avoid had found it he made up to a Walk where he saw them they prov'd to be the Countess of  Oxford  and the Countess of  Bath  who expected the Return of the Countess of  Devonshire  He accosted them and after having signify'd his Satisfaction at their Happy Meeting begg'd them to restore to him his  Tablebook  We found it  said the Countess of  Oxford without knowing that it belonged to you my Lord We were so far Mistresses of our own Curiosity that if you have any Secrets in  it be assur'd we are ignorant of them I don't pretend Madam  reply'd he  to deserve the trouble you could give you of the least Concerns in my Affairs so I am not in the least surpriz'd at your Indifferency upon that Account We are not so indifferent as you imagine  reply'd the Countess of  Bath we were actually for breaking it rather than not have it open'd but my Lord  Stanley  oppos'd it'  'At these Words the Earl chang'd Colour and had these Ladies bin in the least acquainted with both their Concerns they might soon have discover'd both in his Eyes and Countenance the Discomposure of his Mind But as they knew nothing of the Adventure of the Picture they told him it was the Countess of  Devonshire  who had found and kept it she is Walking in the next Wood  said they  with Mrs  Howard  and my Lord  Stanley  where you may ask for it He parted from them with a most profound Reverence but not without some Vexation considering my Lord  Stanley  was with the Countess of  Devonshire  and fearing lest he might have open'd the  Tablebook  and read his Complaints against  Lelia  in order to divert himself with her at his cost'  'Distracted with these Considerations he came to a Shady Walk which my Lord  Stanley  happening to cross at the same time but so as to endeavour to avoid being seen by they Earl and this creating in him a Suspicion that he had the  Tablebook  and intended to keep it for his Diversion he follow'd him apace crying after him Stay stay my Lord and so advancing in a threatening Posture with his Hand upon his Sword demanded the  Tablebook  of him My Lord reply'd fiercely he had none of his  Tablebook  and so likewise laying his Hand to his  Sword they without further ado Drew upon one another and Attack'd one another with such Resolution that in all Probability had prov'd Fatal to them had not the Countess of  Devonshire  and Mrs  Howard  who were not far off run to them and with most violent Outcries for Help thrown themselves most courageously betwixt their Swords to part these Two Rivals'  'My Lord  Stanley  had no great reason to be dissatisfy'd as having the Preference before his Rival with Mrs  Lelia  And as for the Earl of  Pembrook  he had no sooner cast his Eyes upon the Fair Countess of  Devonshire  but struck with Admiration at her Beauty this so entirely raz'd out of his Mind all the Remembrance of  Lelia  as if his Heart had never sigh'd after any thing but the Countess who now stood before him and whom he had seen several times before without being struck with her Perfections whether it were that he did not then take so much notice of her as now or whether the Fatal Hour of surrendering his Heart were not then come we will not determine But now taking the Point of his Sword in his Hand he presented it with a most Gallant and Respectful Air to the Lady and with one Knee bent to the Ground I am vanquish'd Madam  said he  I begg at your Hands a Life I could wish to sacrifice in your Service I did not intend to disarm your Person  said she  but only to allay your Indignation intreating him to rise from the Ground But my Lord since you have given me Encouragment to desire a Favour of you grant my Request and be Friends immediately with my Brother I am satisfy'd it will not be his Fault if you are not so and the Subject of your Quarrel being so inconsiderable I should be much asham'd to have  undertaken this Reconciliation without succeeding in it You are capable of doing every thing  reply'd the Earl  you are absolute Mistress of my Destiny At these Words advancing some Steps towards my Lord  Stanley  he did the same towards him and so without enlarging further upon the Matter they embrac'd and talk'd together like very good Friends when the Countesses of  Oxford  and  Bath  somewhat surpriz'd at their long stay came to look after them Being soon inform'd concerning the Quarrel betwixt the Earl and my Lord they oblig'd them once more to embrace one another and engaged their Honour for their being good Friends for the future the Earl of  Pembrook  being very forwards in making the first Step because he flatter'd himself that by going along with my Lord  Stanley  he might find an easie Access into the Earl of  Devonshire's  House'  'The Countess of  Oxford  had a Magnificent Supper ready for her Guests in the best Appartment of the House adorn'd with many fine Statues and Pictures and among the rest a most excellent Piece of  Psyche  The Earl of  Pembrook  looking very attentively upon it I am afraid  said the Countess of  Devonshire least this Picture should revive in you certain Motions of spite against my Brother Ah Madam  said he  I am far from reflecting at this time upon the Subject of our Quarrel no I have no more Passion for  Lelia  I don't regret the Loss of my  Psyche  but the Felicity of  Love  Madam since I could wish my self to be in her Place I would Wound a certain Female Mortal which appears to me to be so far plac'd above the rest of her Sex that nothing less than an Immortal ought to presume to please her Your Thoughts soar very high my Lord  reply'd the Countess  But  this must be attributed to your high Deserts She gave him no further Leisure to continue his Discourse his Eyes sufficiently betray'd his Sentiments and whatever Care he took all the remaining part of the Evening to come near her she was so dexterous in shunning all Opportunities tho' without the least shew of Affectation that he could never meet with her but in the Company of other Ladies He was not insensible of it Love makes Use of Perspectiveglasses which discover at a distance such things as indifferent Persons would scarce take notice of He was not much acquainted with this kind of Reservedness his great Qualifications join'd to the Charms of his Wit most commonly sheltred him against such like disagreeable Accidents and his Passion being as yet in its beginning he flatter'd himself with Success if he could apply himself in good earnest in the pursuit of his expected Happiness'  'He manag'd Matters so well with my Lord  Stanley  that he conducted him to the Countess his Sister but found it a much more easie Task to oblige my Lord  Devonshire  for whom he had no more than a general Complaisence in point of Policy than to please her whom he Ador'd Her Deportment towards him was kept in so exact a Ballance betwixt a handsome Decorum and an exact Reservedness that he had not the least occasion either to complain or to flatter himself at the same time there was nothing that could have prov'd a greater Affliction to him considering it was impossible for him to quit these flattering Hopes that supported his Passion He wanted Patience to hearken to her Discourse with Complaisance because he even wanted Resolution to discover his Passion having miss'd a thousand Opportunities that fell in his Way for  fear of displeasing this Beautiful Person Thus smothering his Secret in the very innermost Recess of his Heart the only Comfort he had to allay his Pain was that he flatter'd himself her Indifferency to be the same to all the World That time might afford him some unlook'd for Assistance and that at least he should have the Pleasure of seeing of her very often But notwithstanding his Silence the Countess was sensible of his tender Sentiments for her which perhaps might have made some Impressions upon her had not the Merits of the Earl of  Warwick  so far touch'd her Heart as to put it beyond all Capacity of taking notice of the Earl of  Pembrook  's Passion'  This was the State of Affairs at Court when the King told the Earl of  Pembrook  That he was in Love with the Countess of  Devonshire  as well as the Earl of  Warwick  and order'd him as I told you before to go to the said Earl and to engage him to make such an Ingenious Confession as might merit his Pardon It was then the Earl of  Pembrook  began to call to mind how often he had observ'd the Countess of  Devonshire  in a Pensive Condition how often he had heard certain Sighs that seem'd to escape her unawares what unseasonable Answers she us'd to give and with what Satisfaction she us'd to hear them talk of the Earl of  Warwick  As he was ignorant that she knew him so he little suspected of suffering any thing upon his Account on that side but at this very Moment he began to be fully convinc'd of his approaching Misfortunes since he met with a Rival in the Person of his best Friend and such a one whose inevitable Destruction was at hand if the King's Indignation were but never so little heighten'd against him He stood in need of all  his Generosity to espouse at this Conjuncture the Interest of the Earl of  Warwick  which perhaps he would not have done had not his Master's Passion for the Countess threaten'd him with the same Dangers so that considering how blameable it would appear to his own Heart if he should be instrumental in adding to his Disgrace which so sensibly afflicted him already he resolv'd to sacrifice Love to Friendship and be serviceable to his Rival as long as he continu'd to be unfortunate but to break with him as soon as he should cease to be so  He understood that the Earl of  Warwick  had not bin gone to Bed till within two Hours before having spent the rest of the Night in giving Instructions to his Gentleman concerning what he was to say to the Countess of  Devonshire  and to  Albine  He was so very careful not to forget any thing that he repeated the same thing a thousand times and now after his Departure thinking to take some rest was soon disturb'd by the Earl of  Pembrook  After having given him an Account of the whole matter Don't think  added he  of justifying your self by disowning the thing for the King has order'd me to produce before your Face the Witnesses of your Passion for the Countess and of your Breach of Faith to him he is resolv'd to be well inform'd of the whole even to the meanest Circumstance and then he will consider whether to do you Justice or afford you his Pardon The Earl of  Warwick  enrag'd at the sight of the Letters he writ to Madam  Grey  That Perfidious Woman  cry'd he  has made me a Sacrifice She was in the right on't to imagine that it was not on account of her own Person I should scarce have taken so much Pains for her but time will come when I shall make her sensible of my Indignation 'Tis now no Time to think  of Revenge  said the Earl  you must find a way to appease the King And how is that to be done  reply'd the Earl of  Warwick He knows already that I love my Lady  Devonshire  and how can I then make it known to him And as for my renouncing this Passion all the joint Powers upon Earth shall never compel me to do it The King wants to know whether you are belov'd  said the Earl of  Pembrook Belov'd  reply'd the Earl of  Warwick I know nothing of that but if I am not I don't despair of being so The Earl of  Pembrook  found himself touch  d to the quick at these Words However he so well dissembled the Torments of his Mind that he discover'd nothing of it at that time Questionless  added he  you are enter'd into a very pleasing Correspondence with this Fair Lady 'Tis true  said the Earl  I have writ to her and she has somtimes sent me an Answer And that full of Tenderness  said my Lord  Pembrook No  answer'd he  she acts with a great deal of Circumspection and Mistrust How can this be consistent  reply'd he  with the Liberty that was given you to have an Interview with her in the Night time How I  cry'd the Earl  Yes you  reply'd he  the King knows the whole Intrigue Alas What then would he have more of me  reply'd my Lord  Warwick  with an impatient Countenance  He would have  said the Earl  an exact account of all the Transactions belonging thereto from the greatest to the meanest Circumstance  The Earl of  Warwick  pausing a while upon the Matter and afterwards turning his Eyes towards him with a settled Assurance My Lord  said he  I respect the King as my Soveraign and as my Master and I may say it without Vanity That without me he had perhaps bin neither one nor the other But I love him besides all this as the  best of my Friends I begg of him to take Pity of the Frailties of my Heart which not always consults Reason before it surrenders it self I fell in Love with the Countess of  Devonshire  before I knew any thing of his Majesty's Passion for her When he did me the Honour to make me his Confident therein it was too late for me to hope for a Cure I rather cherish'd my Fetters and conceal'd them with all possible Care not so much out of fear to disoblige the King as out of a desire of pleasing the Person I Ador'd At last her Departure threw me into so deep a Melancholly Vexation and Extravagancy that I discover'd my self in Writing certain Verses instead of the Speech the King dictated to me Madam  Grey  has taken this Opportunity to contrive my Ruin by shewing my Letters but after all What is it they can do to me As long as I am prepossess'd with the same Passion as I now am nothing but what has a relation to that will have any Effect upon me All the rest whether good or bad whether Rewards or Chastisements all this I say will not affect me And this is perhaps the only Thing in this Intrigue the King is not acquainted with as yet and this being all I can tell him pray let him know it from me The Earl of  Pembrook  who was his real Friend desir'd him to alter his Resolutions and by an account without reserve to appease his Majesty He told him He could say no more That he was not Happy but that if his Fortune should prove more favourable all the most Cruel Torments should not force from his Mouth as much as one Word that might prove injurious to the Honour of a Lady that was so dear to him and that it could not but vex him to the Heart to find the King to have so ill an Opinion of him as to think him capable of betraying the Favours of a Lady The Earl of  Pembrook  represented to him the ill Consequences of his Obstanacy But he told him He would expect the Stroak with Tranquillity having this secret Satisfaction That he knew nothing wherewith to reproach himself  These Ambiguous Answers made the Earl of  Pembrook  's Thoughts fluctuate betwixt Hope and Fear sometimes he thought the Earl no more Happy than himself and at other times he did not doubt but that he liv'd in certain Hopes of being belov'd but as all this remain'd in an incertitude so the more he abandon'd himself to these Reflections the more matter of Trouble he encounter'd with in unfolding the Mistery Alas  said he  I have not had Courage enough to speak nay not so much as to suffer my Eyes to make known my present Condition and the Earl has writ to this Countess nay has had an Interview with her in the midst of a dark Night For tho' he did not absolutely confess it who can doubt it after what has happen'd when he was taken up by the Watch See how I pay for my Timidity my respectful Silence is punish'd as if it were a Crime Thus Comfortless he goes back to the Court with so dejected a Countenance as if he had bin very Sick The King was surpriz'd at the sight thereof and could not for bear to shew him some peculiar Marks of good Will for being so perfect a Friend When he gave an account to his Majesty of what had pass'd betwixt the Earl and him he left nothing unattempted to allay the King's Indignation and wrought so effectually upon the King that he resolv'd not to Banish so far off as he at first intended Nay he begg'd the King to send him only to  Chelsey  but the King being too well acquainted with that Seat as not to know what Pleasures he might enjoy there he pitch'd upon  Caerleon  for a Place of his Banishment This had bin in former Ages a considerable City in  SouthWales  seated upon the River  Ʋsque  but whereof nothing being left now but Ruins and Miserable Remnants of Antiquity this prov'd not a very convenient Place for the Entertainment of a Person so much accustom'd as he was to Pleasure and Magnificence  The King now exasperated to a high degree order'd the Earl of  Pembrook  to return immediately to the Earl of  Warwick  and to tell him from him That within two Hours he must depart for  Caerleon  He was somewhat doubtful whether he had best accept of this Commission or whether he should desire the King to employ some body else in it but at last fearing lest his Friend might not receive this Command with so much Submission as he ought to do and that the same might be afterwards ill represented to the King in hopes of consummating the Ruin of a Disgrac'd Favourite most frequently practis'd among Courtiers he was contented to undertake this Order the better to take care of his Friends Interest He thought it but requisite to bring in by way of Introduction certain things commonly made Use of to prepare People's Minds against an ill Piece of News To what purpose serve all these Precautions my Lord  cry'd he  when I told you this Morning that nothing could actually afflict me unless it related to my Lady  Devonshire  if nothing that is amiss has befaln her speak without fear for I am prepar'd against all Events You are to be sent out of the way  said the Earl of  Pembrook  embracing him  I am overjoy'd at it  reply'd he  And has the King done me the Favour to pitch upon a Place remote from all Conversation with the World A Desart where I may employ my Thoughts Day and Night where I  may send forth my Sighs and Complaints for not seeing the Countess and where at last I may not come near that dangerous SheFavourite of his the Presence whereof will be always odious to me Your Wishes are accomplish'd  said the Earl of  Pembrook  Caerleon  is the Place design'd by the King for your Banishment and it is his Pleasure you should depart within two Hours The time is very short  said the Earl  but no Matter I shall be pleas'd once more with the Sight of the River  Ʋsque  Pray tell the King That within two Hours I will be no more in  London  and that I shall be very well pleas'd with my Place of Abode They did bid one another Farewel with all the Tenderness imaginable for the Earl not knowing my Lord of  Pembrook  to be his Rival there was nothing that interfer'd with their Friendship on his side He left  London  with so much Precipitation that he would not so much as take his Leave of the Archbishop of  York  and the Marquess of  Montague  his Brothers For he fear'd that they being incens'd at his ill Treatment might urge him to go over to  Calas  whereof he was then Governour and by putting himself under the Protection of the  French  King revenge himself of King  Edward  The Earl of  Warwick  's Gentleman coming to  Twittenham  with Letters from the Dutchess of  Norfolk  to my Lady  Anglesey  thought not fit to deliver them himself for fear of being known but gave them to the  French  Gardener his pretended Master to give them to that Lady whilst he kept at a distance in one of the darkest Corners of the Room The Countess of  Anglesey  much pleas'd with the Draughts this Gardener shew'd her pitch'd upon one for her Garden ordering him to begin it the next Day The Fellow was very well pleas'd with it being born and train'd  up in this kind of Work but agreed but very indifferently with  Berincour  he being but little us'd to Hardship especially since the Countess being very eager to have it brought to Perfection and there being abundance of Weeds to be cut up and other matters to be done he that was to Survey the Work us'd often to check him after a very rough manner His best Comfort was That he saw the Countess of  Devonshire  taking a Walk every Day in a Shady Wilderness at the End of the Place where they were at Work but in so Melancholly a Condition and accompany'd by so many Surveyers that he durst not speak to her for fear of being discover'd As for  Albine  she did not appear for a considerable time being detain'd in Bed by an  Ague  so that the poor Earl who impatiently long'd for some News in his Solitude could not hear of any a good while that might be pleasing to him  Berincour  knew that  Albine  was Sick at last took an Opportunity to let her know by a young Woman with whom he dined some times That if she pleas'd he could Cure her provided she would let him apply certain Herbs to her Wrests which would produce an almost stupendious Effect So she sent for him and he after some superstitious Ceremonies apply'd the Herbs to her Wrests but at the same time did not forget to revive her Eyesight with the Lustre of the Jewel his Master had sent her by him which he held in his Hand so as to be seen by no body but her self The old  Albine  dazled with the Brightness thereof soon got out of Bed into the Garden where she call'd for the Gardener's Man under pretence that he should assist her in supporting her to Walk whilst they might talk of the most stupendious Operations and Cure perform'd by his Herbs  So soon as he had an Opportunity of speaking to her he told her That the Earl had no other Hopes left but what he expected from her Assistance having sent him on purpose to acquaint her with every thing that pass'd That he was afflicted to the Heart because he heard no News from my Lady  Devonshire  since she had left  London  and therefore had given him a large Letter directed to my Lady and a Jewel for her Things have faln out so unexpectedly  answer'd Albine  and the young Countess has so possitively forbid me to entertain any further Correspondence with the Earl that this join'd to the Impossibility of Writing without being discover'd by so many  Argus  's as we have about us I saw my self constrain'd to be quiet when I wish'd I could have done otherwise She then told him what had happen'd with the Watch the unfortunate Accident of the Jewel and Picture the Jealousy of the Earl and the Vexation of the Countess of  Devonshire  and how she had bin reprimanded by her Mother What must we do my dear  Albine said Berincour  My Master can't live if your Mistress perseveres in her Rigour I conjure you by all that is good to procure me a Moment to speak with her or at least take my Letter and let me have an Answer I can promise you nothing  said Albine  you may be assur'd of my Zeal for your Service For fear their Conversation should have created some Suspicion if it had continu'd longer  Albine  went out of the Garden but fail'd not to come again every Day and would talk with  Berincour  under some favourable pretence or other  I told you before he was a Handsome Fellow so that notwithstanding the Sun had made him as Tawny as a  TawnyMoor  and his being much harrass'd with continual Labour the old Gentlewoman  took a great Fansie to him She suppos'd nothing could be more proper than to make a Match betwixt the He and She Confidents of two Rich Lovers That the Earl being in a Condition to make his Gentleman's Fortune my Lady would shew no less Liberality and Goodness for her To be short she had got the Match so far in her Head that she took but little concern in the Affair of the Earl of  Warwick  and whenever she found her self urg'd by  Berincour  she would tell him she was forc'd to act with a great deal of Precaution What makes you  said he  detain me thus here You know what Danger I am in if I am discover'd I am oblig'd to Work from Daybreak till Night I am ready to die for Vexation and am convinc'd you don't intend to do any further Service to my Master How impatient are you  reply'd she  and how little concern you shew and the Trouble I take of coming so frequently to talk with you Alas were your Heart as inclinable to gratitude as mine is you would not be so eager for going but would make the best Use of the present Opportunity At these Words  Berincour  was ready to burst out a laughing but having forborn it with much ado he told her That all this time his Thoughts were taken up with his Master's Affairs but that for the future she might be sure of all his Applications and that she should be satisfy'd how passionately he lov'd her  Albine  being uncertain whether she had best believe him or not And how can I be assur'd  reply'd she  that you will Love me if you don't Love me already I should much suspect a Passion that is so much at your Command He told her That his seeing and loving her were of the same Date That if she would dispatch him quickly he would soon return on purpose to Court her This Promise  set the old Gentlewoman to Work for the same Evening she told my Lady  Devonshire  That neither her Silence nor her Coldness being able to check the Earls P  ssion he had left no Stone unturn'd to hear some News of her and that his Gentleman was there in Disguise to deliver her a Letter which she had undertaken to give to her  The Countess's Colour changed at these Words Will you Ruin me  Albine said she  have you already forgot how much I have suffered only for having acted with less Reservedness than I should have done And though I have nothing that is Material to upbraid my self withal 'tis nevertheless too much to give the World real Cause of Suspicion Don't speak to me any more of the Earl of  Warwick  my Stubborn Heart is too apt to do it without you How Madam  said  Albine  to her  will you refuse to accept his Letter Yes I will refuse it  reply'd she  Give it back to him who brought it to you and order him from me to be gone  Albine  not a little surprized at this resolute Answer You will then prove the Cause of his Death  said she  or perhaps he will commit such a Piece of Extravagancy as you will have occasion to repent of as long as you live And how long is it  reply'd the Countess with an angry look  since Men have that Liberty of Persecuting a Woman that is inclined to adhere strictly to her Duty Leave me at rest  Albine  the Force I put upon my Inclinations is ready to put an end to my Life but what matter is it  added she with a very Melancholy Air  since I have nothing that should render Life more desireable to me At these Words the Tears beginning to stand in her Eyes  Albine  look'd upon it as a favourable Minute to engage her to open the Earl's Pacquet  Madam  said she  throwing her self at her Feet don't you refuse to Read this Letter my Lord  Warwick  will otherwise think you slight him and how do you think a Man of his Haughty Temper can digest such a usage as this Perhaps his Love may turn into Hatred Oh let him Hate me  cry'd she  'tis all I desire him to do But all this while her Heart not being strong enough to retain her Sighs within her Breast and  Albine  watching narrowly every one of her Motions did not fail to tell her a Thousand Reasons to engage her to open the Pacquet But seeing the Countess would not do it she did Read it aloud before her The Countess had weakness enough to hear it Read but cou'd not be prevail'd upon to return an Answer  Albine  having given a full account of all that had pass'd to  Berincour  he found such an agreeable Mixture of Tenderness and Vertue in this Proceeding of my Lady  Devonshire  that he could not forbear to Compassionate her Condition and to wish that his Master would desist from pursuing the Matter any further Notwithstanding which he fail'd not to entreat the old Gentlewoman to renew her Temptations to obtain a few Lines from her Hands and she was not sparing either of her Arguments nor Prayers but the Countess tired with her importunity threatning to acquaint her Lord with it She found now there was nothing to be done for  Berincour  but to return to his Master and to give some Colour to his Departure The Head Gardener pretended he had occasion to send him to  London  to Buy some things he stood in need of  Berincour  knew nothing of his Masters Exilement but being inform'd thereof at  London  he  went straightways to  Caerleon  coming thither he understood he was walking on the Banks of the River  Ʋsque  And the Gentleman as he went in search for him found on several Trees Engrave  the Cyphers of the Countess and divers Verses he had composed upon her The Earl no sooner espy'd him but full of impatience ran to meet him asking what Answer he brought from the Countess of  Devonshire  Whereupon  Berincour  desired him to have Patience to hearken to what he had to say The Account he receiv'd from him serving only to make him think himself more unhappy than really he was threw him into a very deep Melancholly and he now began to fansy that  Albine  out of a Motive of self Interest had flattered him with all those Tender Relations She said she had understood in Conversing with his Mistress and that it was too true that she had no more than a bare Indifferency for him because she would not Write to him This Opinion being back'd by many Circumstances threw him into a most violent Anguish Thus he spent Three days under the greatest Incertitude what to do till at last he resolv'd to send back  Berincour  to the Countess and to fill his Letters with such urging Complaints and Declarations of Respect that she should not remain insensible thereat His Gentleman who not very well liked his Errand represented to him but in vain how little likelihood there was for better Success in this Second than in his First Journey But he upbraiding him with Want of Affection he departed in the old Disguise of a Gardener the better to conceal himself from every body  During his Absence my Lady  Devonshire  who was with Child narrowly escaped being kill'd by a Fall So that upon his Arrival  there he was told by  Albine  that it would be very difficult for her Mistress to find a favourable Opportunity of speaking to him because she was very seldom left alone But  added she  What happens very Fortunate is that I shall often see you so we must talk concerning our Marriage and if we can't accomplish the Earl of  Warwick  and the Countesses Business at least we will take care of our own Make not the least account upon that  said he to her with an angry look  my Fortune depends on the Success of this Negotiation and unless my Master be satisfy'd I will never think of Marriage These Words having added new Life and Vigour to the Old Gentlewoman's Desires she immediately acquainted her Mistress with the News of the return of the Earl's Gentleman which proved a fresh occasion of Trouble to her She Commanded her positively not to take his Letters and that if he did not withdraw from the House forthwith she would make him repent of it The Old Confident seeing her so Resolute could do no otherwise than tell  Berincour  that he had best to depart with the first opportunity and that all the Earl would be able to do for the future would be in vain because the Countess had taken this opportunity of his absence to hearken to her Reason That she made every day more and more Progress in recalling her Inclinations from him and therefore was resolv'd not to Read any of his Letters lest his Passionate Expressions should revive in her Heart an Idea she had found too Dear and too Dangerous for her Repose  Berincour  had nothing to object against what he was told by  Albine  But being too well acquainted with his Master's Temper to venture at his Return without some more Comfortable  Answer he told her That since his so sudden Departure would be infallibly attended with some remarkable ill Consequences he only desired some time to do it at his own leasure and when he saw a fit opportunity to do it and  Albine  managed the Matter so far with my Lady  Devonshire  that she gave Ear to this Proposition The Countess had done all that possibly could be done when she refus'd with so firm a Resolution to read the Letters of the Earl of  Warwick  but notwithstanding her real desire of Remembring him no more nay even of Hating him 'tis certain that not a Day pass'd but she felt within her self certain strong Inclinations for him No  said she  to her Confident I would never forgive my self for these Sentiments I still preserve for him were it not that by the Violences I daily impose upon my self I were sufficiently convinc'd that one is not Mistress of ones own Inclinations a certain fatal Constellation has made me see the Earl and since that unhappy Moment neither all the Reflections I can make in respect of my self nor the Motives of my Duty nor the Advantage of his Absence have bin able to raze him out of my Thoughts  Albine  being a Person who preferr'd her own Interest before all other Considerations was so far from urging her Mistress to keep stedfast to her Resolution that she excus'd her Frailty alledging many Instances of that Nature which instead of perfecting the Cure might serve rather to encrease her Distemper  This was the Condition of this Fair Lady when she just had got strength enough to take the Air in the Garden the very Place where  Berincour  watch'd all her Motions being resolv'd to take the first favourable Opportunity of speaking to  her He happen'd to meet with one one Day when he saw the Countess Reading in an Arbour her Woman being at a good distance from her to gather a Nosegay He at the same time run immediately to the Place where he knew the choicest Flowers were took care to gather such of them as he judg'd by their odoriferous Scent and various Colours might be most agreeable to her these he presented to her in a Basket and she casting her Eyes first upon the Flowers and afterwards upon the Gardener was soon convinc'd he was the Earl's Gentleman She Blush'd at the Sight of him and was a going into the next Walk but besides that she had not recover'd as yet her full Strength the suddenness of so surprizing a Sight had so far impair'd the Use of her Limbs that she saw her self oblig'd to sit down again in the same Place Madam  said  Berincour  to her  you know very well who I am and what it is I hope for from your Goodness What is it you would have with me  said she with a trembling Voice  Has not  Albine  spoke to you concerning me But I can't believe  added he  what she tells me since I can't Imagine Madam the Earl of  Warwick  to have given you sufficient occasion to hate him to such a degree as to procure his Death in refusing to Read his Letter and giving me an Answer No  reply'd she abruptly  I will have no manner of Correspondence with him What is it I have done to him that he should thus persecute me in a Solitude which ought to shelter me against the Danger of his Remembrance Let him be Happy at Court but leave me in Repose You don't know then Madam  reply'd he  how much he deserves your Compassion The King has Banish'd him into a kind of a Desart where he would live contented would you but take the least share in his Pain The Countess stood surpriz'd  for tho' this Piece of News was well known in the Family they had conceal'd it from her because they would not mention the Earl's Name Alas all her preceeding Resolutions of Indifferency could not stand the brunt of this Surprize the Air of her Face nay her Voice began to change into a milder Disposition she took the Letters  Berincour  deliver'd to her and having hid them carefully immediately left the Arbour and Garden being very impatient to see what the Earl had writ to her The whole Packet contain'd no less than Six Letters but it will be sufficient to insert one which may save as a Pattern to give a Judgment of all the rest  WHen you hear the News of my Banishment you will doubtless pity me Madam and will believe that I look upon it as a Disgrace but I have not so much Sense left as to be sensible of it The Sentiments I preserve for you make me indifferent to every thing that does not concern you and I am so far from being alone in this Dismal Solitude that I am in better Company than ever I was at Court Yes Divine Countess I am entirely possess'd with your Idea I carry it every where about me and it is my constant Entertainment neither could I wish for any thing in the World that would please me better since I am depriv'd of seeing you any more so that I dare affirm That if I am unhappy 'tis owing only to your Indifferency Alas Madam What Crime have I committed against you to cause me so much Pain I Love you and that is my Crime But don't we also Love the Gods and they are not offended at it And tho' I pay you the same Respect as we do to them you treat me more rigorously than they would do Afford a few Lines of your own Hand Writing to the Violence and Purity of my Passion  this being the only Remedy I desire to allay all the Evils you make me suffer  My Lady  Devonshire  had no sooner read the Earl of  Warwick  's Letter but she call'd  Albine  into her Closet who seeing her Mistress all in Tears could not conceive what fresh Occasion of Grief was befaln her Don't be surpriz'd  said she  these Tears I shed are too reasonable to be stopt I am afflicted to see my self still guilty of so much Weakness the Earl's Exilement touches me to the Heart His Exilement Madam  reply'd  Albine  Berincour  has not said one Word of it to me I wish  continu'd the Countess  this Secret had bin kept from me as well as it has bin from you I should then have no occasion of reproaching my self with having read a Letter from a Person whose Correspondence occasions so much Trouble to the Earl of  Devonshire Albine  then made use of all her  Rhetorick  to persuade her Mistress that she could not without much Injustice refuse her Pity to an unfortunate Man she extoll'd the Earl's Merits above the Skies and this dangerous Confident so continually tormented and disturb'd her with her Arguments and Entreaties that in spite of all her former Resolutions not to write to the Earl she could not forbear to send him an Answer in these Words  IF that Esteem which I have hitherto preserved for you deserves an Acknowledgment Don't remember my Lord that you ever saw me and permit me to enjoy a Tranquillity I am not Mistress of now I can't imagine why you shou'd persist in persecuting of me for so I must call those Demonstrations of a Passion which is offensive to me and which had before this produc'd my Hatred against you were I in a Condition of hating you However the Impossibility I  am under of loving you because I ought not and of hating you because I cannot deserves all the Compassion you are capable off Assist me then in finding out such a Disposition to Indifferency as may prove the Glory and Repose of my Life  She left off in all probability sooner than she intended because her Tears stopt the Course of her Pen her Heart checking her Hand for an Action so opposite to the Promise she had made to her Mother and Husband She told  Albine  she would tear the Letter for fear of some sinister Consequences and she was actually going to do it when  Albine  clapping her Hand upon it took and hid it in her Bossom No Madam  said she  I must not give it you again there is no reason you should so suddenly alter your Resolution in behalf of a Person who has done nothing to displease you You forbid him to Love you he ought to have it under your own Hand and then he will have no reason to flatter himself and I am almost certain this is the Way to Cure him Do'st thou believe so  Albine reply'd the Countess much concern'd  then I will not send the Letter But soon recollecting her self What is it I say  continu'd she  What did I say What are my Intentions Would I suffer my self to be belov'd by any other Person but the Earl of  Devonshire  Whilst the Countess was thus fixing her Resolution to break off all Correspondence with the Earl and to begin with the burning of the Letter she had writ just before  Albine  considering she could do no greater piece of Service to  Berincour  than to give it him in order to deliver it to his Master slipt out of the Closet unperceiv'd by her Mistress and running straight into the Garden put the Letter into the Gentleman's Hands  During  Berincour  's late Journey to  Caerleon  the beforemention'd  French  Gardener was faln in Love with a Handsome young  English  Damsel and as it is a hard Task to keep any thing from what one loves this Gardener was not altogether so much taken up with his Courtship but that he would sometimes Talk of his Companion and this young Woman taking particular notice of this Gentleman in Disguise began to like him so well that she thought if she were born a Gentlewoman she could be much better satisfy'd with him than with a Country Fellow At last she could not forbear to speak concerning him to her Mother and it would have bin Death to the old Woman not to tell the Secret to her Husband So the Gardener perceiving the thing to have taken Vent thought it his safest way to declare the whole Truth thereof himself to the Earl of  Devonshire  He was touch'd to the quick at this News not knowing what to resolve upon sometimes he was for cutting  Berincour  's Throat before his Lady's Face and then to carry things to the utmost Extremity Soon after he was speaking to the Earl of  Anglesey  to desire satisfaction of him on account of his Daughter Love Jealousy Honour Tenderness and Hatred enter'd into a most Cruel Combat within his Breast Distracted with these various Agitations of his Mind the Chevalier  d' Hereford  his Kinsman and one of his most intimate Friends comes to  Twittenham  to spend Two or Three Days with the Earl who looking upon his Arrival as one of the most seasonable things that could have happen'd desir'd him to take a Walk upon the Side of the River  Thames  They were no sooner come at some Distance from those that attended them but after a few Moments silence You see the most unfortunate of Mankind  said he to the Chevalier  I  came to this River with no other Intention than to throw my self to the Bottom of it to put an end to those Misfortunes I was not Born to  Hereford  looking upon him like a Man amaz'd What has happen'd to you my Lord  said he  You know I am absolutely yours let me be a Sharer in your Discontents perhaps I may help you to support them with the more Patience Oh  said the Earl  my Pain owes its Original to a Cause which exceeds all ordinary Pains That Excess of Friendship I always had for my Lady  Devonshire  is now the deadly Cause of my Grief How  cry'd the Chevalier  You don't complain of her I can't imagine what Reason you should have for it Hear me  said the Earl interrupting him  and I will leave it to your own Judgment He then gave him an ample account of the whole Matter intermixing his Relation with Tender Reproaches and Violent Threats no otherwise than if he had bin talking to his Lady whence it was easie to guess that it would prove very difficult to moderate his Anger However the Chevalier having a fix'd and singular Esteem for the Countess was resolv'd to undertake the Task  You are not in a Condition to act in your own Person  said he to the Earl  because the Point in Question too nearly concerns you Your Senses are impair'd and you will see your Lady's Innocence even when you would not see it Well supposing the Earl of  Warwick  's Gentleman to be in your House Disguis'd like a Gardener doubtless his Master sent him either to assist him in coming hither Incognito or to receive his Letters and to deliver his Answers it will be no hard matter for you to find out the true reason thereof give him but a little  Opium  and having got his Papers into your Hands you may take the best Measures you can without the least Noise  If the Earl of  Warwick reply'd the Earl  keeps him here to favour his coming privately into the House there is no way to find it out unless by the Confession of this Gentleman No Matter  reply'd the Chevalier  let us begin with my Proposal and we will end as you shall think fit The Chevalier prevailing with the Earl to follow his Advice it was agreed to mix some  Opium  in the Gentleman's Drink by the Assistance of one of their Faithful Domesticks who met with no great Difficulty to perform his Promise  Berincour  who had work'd very hard all that Day in the Garden being much tired at Night and eager for his Supper to go to Bed in good time because he was to rise next Morning before Daybreak in order to depart with the so much desir'd Answer of the Countess's he was to deliver to the Earl  The  Chevalier de Hereford  desir'd the Earl of  Devonshire  to leave the whole Management of this Affair to his Conduct so that entring the pretended Gardener's Chamber in Company of that Person only who had procur'd the  Opium  he found a very large Pacquet about him what had increas'd its Bulk was That the Countess being resolv'd not to keep the Earl of  Warwick  's Letters and having not Resolution enough to burn them she sent them back along with her own Letter The Chevalier much surpriz'd at the Sight of the Pacquet was at a stand whether to give it to the Earl or not being ignorant of the Contents thereof which he fear'd might turn to my Lady  Devonshire  's Ruin It was then he made a thousand Melancholly Reflections upon the Misfortunes unto which too often the Imprudence of young People exposes them and had he thought himself sure of his Opinion he would certainly have avoided to give new cause of Trouble to his Kinsman  But the worst was that besides that the Domestick who went along with him had seen the Pacquet the Earl of  Devonshire  would not be satisfy'd at an easie rate And it prov'd so on the sequel for he waited for him in a long Gallery where disturb'd with his Inquietudes he walk'd up and down apace and no sooner saw the Chevalier but laying his Hand to his Sword not knowing very well what he did or what he would have ask'd him abruptly for the Letters I am a coming to give them to you  said the Chevalier  and then delivering them to the Earl he tore the Covert and Signets and soon knew the first the Earl's and then his Lady's Hand writing at the last of which he stood very much surpriz'd whilst the Chevalier was highly pleas'd thereat  You see my Lord  said he  the Countess is not guilty the Earl of  Warwick  Persecutes her he sends his Gentleman without her knowledge she forbids him to Love her she is angry with him she will not so much as keep his Letters which would appear pleasing to any other Woman but her self What further Satisfaction can you desire You represent to me  reply'd he  my Wife's Conduct on the fairest Side but let us take the thing as really it is What can you say for a young Lady who suffers a Gentleman of so dangerous a Person as the Earl of  Warwick  is to stay in her Family Who lets him abide there in Disguise Who keeps his Secret Who receives his Letters And who in effect tells him that she Loves him in telling him  That she can't hate him  In what Country besides this would such kind of Freedom be allow'd of with Patience The Chevalier let him go on in his Discourse without the least Contradiction for fear of exasperating him the more in case he should endeavour to convince him by strength of Reason  which seldom takes place with Persons infected with Jealousy but only conjur'd him not to disturb the Repose of his whole Family by noising the Thing abroad At last he put him in mind that the Countess had acquir'd the general good Opinion of all the World as a Person who in all respects answer'd the Character of that Education she had by the Care of my Lady her Mother but that if he suffer'd this matter in the least to take Vent the Publick Rumour which always makes a Monster of a Fly would also upon this occasion not be spairing to aggrandize the Story That if he would follow his Advice he ought to manage the Point with the utmost Address and Nicety and to contrive how to make a Breach betwixt her and the Earl For since it was evident by her Letter that she preferr'd her Duty before all other Considerations it would be no diffiult Task to secure her in that Opinion Accordingly it was agreed betwixt the Earl of  Devonshire  and the  Chevalier  to keep the whole Secret from the knowledge of the Countess and to write these few Words in a Woman's Character to the Earl of  Warwick  Let me be at rest I will never hear you as much as to be spoken of  They folded the Paper and having made up the Pacquet just as it was before seal'd it with just such another Seal as that of the Countess's the Earl who had given it to her happening to have the fellow of it Every thing being thus contriv'd they put it again into  Berincour  's Pocket unperceiv'd to him And so according as he had propos'd the Night before he went away to satisfy his Master who expected his Return with the utmost Impatience  I give you leave to guess at his Surprize and Resentment at the reading of so rough and harsh a Farewel How Barbarous Woman  cry'd he  do I undergo this Cruel Exilement for your sake I have lost the King's Favour I was willing to sacrifice my Repose and my whole Fortune to the Satisfaction of pleasing you you are not ignorant of it my Letters and Addresses have sufficiently told it you and you repay me with nothing but Disdain No no don't imagine me to be not able to forget you I break your Chains and nothing shall be remaining of them but the shame of wearing them He added a thousand Reproaches to these Words appearing for several Days like a Man in a Frenzy who was combating nothing but Airy Phantasms sometimes Discomfited sometimes Victorious not knowing what Resolution to take He would spend whole Nights near the River  Ʋsque  addressing himself to the Trees and Rocks without being sensible for the most part of what he said  At last this Distemper the most dangerous of all sorts of Fevers began to abate by Degrees his Reason which had lain conceal'd for a great while began on a sudden to take its proper Station and display its Charms 'Twas now he began to compassionate his Destiny and be sensible of its Hardship The same Desart which so lately had appear'd to him the most delightful Place in the World was now turn'd to the most disagreeable of all others Hitherto the Days seem'd too short for him to ruminate upon his Passion but now they were insupportable to him and if now and then he thought of the Countess it was in spite of himself and to find out her Defects He did not think fit to ask the Intercession of his Brothers with the King in his behalf but pitch'd upon another Method He sent  Berincour  to such Friends as he knew could be serviceable to him but more especially to the Earl of  Pembrook  to desire him to acquaint the King that he was ready to make a sincere Confession at his Feet of every thing he had a mind to know concerning this Intrigue and that he would promise his Majesty never to love the Countess of  Devonshire  any more This News caused no small Satisfaction to the Earl of  Pembrook  who saw himself thus freed from a most dangerous Rival without which he had but little hopes of meeting with a favourable Reception from the Countess This engag'd him to make his Application to the King with the utmost of his Zeal However that Prince did not think fit to grant a Request made so late but would have his Penance bear some Proportion to his Fault and that he should purchase his Pardon by his reiterated Prayers which he refus'd to hearken to at present  The Chevalier having engag'd the Earl of  Devonshire  upon his Honour not to shew the least Indifferency or Anger to his Lady and every thing being agreed betwixt them in relation to the further Management of this Affair he went to  London  but came back into the Country soon after 'Twas about the same time that the Earl of  Warwick  being recall'd from his Exilement those that were the most intimate Friends of the Earl of  Devonshire  were the first who gave notice thereof to the said Earl they further told him That the Earl had never appear'd more Gay in all his Life time and that he was faln in Love with one of the Maids of Honour of the Dutchess of  York  a Beautiful young Lady and of a very good Family The Earl of  Devonshire  was very ready to read these Letters before his Lady who at that time diverting  her self with making some Silk Embroderywork was put into such a Confusion by this unexpected Piece of News that she made some Roses she was then working at of a Blue Colour and  Jessamins  and  Jonquilles  Green without being sensible of her Mistake The Earl perceiv'd it to his singular regret and would questionless have discover'd the most violent Marks of his Resentment had not the Chevalier come into the Room at that very Juncture of time His Presence checking the Effects of his Indignation he gave him an account of what he had observ'd No  said he  there is no room for flattering my self any longer That ingrateful Creature Loves him She has too much betray'd the Inclinations of her Heart I will be Reveng'd But the Chevalier so far prevail'd upon him by his most earnest Intreaties that he was appeas'd for that time  Within two Days after the  Chevalier de Hereford  as he was Walking with the Countess in the Garden look'd upon this as a favourable Opportunity to manage his Design He told her He was sorry he should prove the Occasion of giving her some Disquiet but that he could not without blaming himself forbear to acquaint her with the Actions of the Earl of  Warwick  who had so little regard to her Favours as to shew her Letters abroad That one of them being by good Fortune faln into his Hands he had kept it and was now come on purpose to restore it to her The Countess judging no otherwise than that he had bin set on by the Earl of  Devonshire  to feel her Pulse was a going to check his Boldness but soon perceiving her own Hand writing she turn'd as Pale as Ashes but soon after a sudden redness overspreading her Face and Bosom were  sufficient Demonstrations of her Confusion and Indignation My Intentions were too sincere and unblemish'd  said she to the Chevalier  in writing this Billet to have the least occasion of disowning it and I dare promise my self that every thing being duly consider'd it will turn rather to my Honour than Disgrace at the same time it makes me sensible of the Baseness of the Earl of  Warwick  against whom I from this time vow an implacable Hatred He must certainly be one of the basest Men living to play me such a Game but I will assure him it shall never be said he contriv'd my Ruin for his own Diversion since I will make him feel the Effects of my Resentment Madam  reply'd the Chevalier  if you will give me leave to advise you stifle this Matter for fear it should come to my Lord  Devonshire  's Ears you know him to be a Man too nice in certain Points and the last time we came hither he told me some part of his Affliction upon the Road Believe me Madam the securest way a Lady of your Age and Birth can take is not to give any occasion of her being much talk'd of in Publick since there are not wanting every where such as will put the worst Interpretation upon the most Innocent Actions that can be You live in a numerous Family and the best way to obtain their Commendation is not to make your self a publick Discourse at Court and that it may not be said the Countess of  Devonshire  has bin quarreling such a Day and such a Day with the Earl of  Warwick  because he shew'd a Letter she had written to him  Whilst he was talking to her she kept her Eyes immoveably fix'd on the Ground and then bursting out into Tears she thank'd him for  his Advice assuring him that she would follow it being resolv'd not to appear any more at Court but to pass all the remainder of her Days in the Country The Chevalier told her it would not be for her good thus to resolve upon such an Extream since she could not refuse to go along with the Family if they went to  London  She answer'd She was resolv'd not to go thither unless the Earl her Spouse should oblige her to it which she suppos'd he would not for  Twittenham  being not above Eight or Nine Miles from  London  he might go and come at pleasure without the least Inconveniency The Chevalier finding her so resolute thought it more convenient to seem to approve of her Design than to contest any longer in vain especially since he knew the Earl of  Devonshire  intended to keep her in the Country for a considerable time  She was no sooner gone but the Chevalier returning to the Earl of  Devonshire  's Apartment gave him an Account of their whole Conversation and they were both extreamly well satisfy'd both with this first good Success and with the Resolution they had taken of breaking off the Correspondence with the Earl of  Warwick  by furnishing them with occasion of mutual Complaints whereas if they had made a Noise of the matter it might have serv'd rather to cement their Affections and  Chevalier de Hereford  being apprehensive that his Kinsman might make some false Steps contrary to what had bin agreed on betwixt them seldom left him alone taking all Opportunities of allaying his Anger  My Lady  Devonshire  returning into her Closet and throwing her self upon a Couch without saying one Word to  Albine  and she perceiving  some remarkable alterations in her looks begg'd her to impart to her the reason of her Grief Oh Unhappy Woman  said the Countess with a surious look  'Tis thou that art the Cause of my Grief Thou hast plagued me to receive the Earl of  Warwick  's Letters and it was thou who didst engage me in spite of all my Foresight to return an answer to them This Perfidious Man has Sacrific'd my Letter to his Mistress which would have bin handed about every where had not the Chevalier  de Hereford  so far concern'd himself in my Honour and Quiet as to put a stop to it perhaps it might by this time have bin in my Husbands Hands I am so highly exasperated at so Notorious an Injury that I will never either forget or forgive it whilst I live  Albine  appear'd like Thunderstruck without being able to utter one Word and her Eyes being shut she appear'd like one petrify'd or struck with Death whilst my Lady  Devonshire  quite overcome with her own Grief little troubled her self with her Confident At last Madam  said she  and has the Earl of  Warwick  Treated you thus unworthily 'Twas then upon that account only he sent his Gentleman hither to get one of your Letters into his Hands to boast of your Favours I protest to you I will not as much as mention him any more unless it be to conjure you to continue and encrease your Hatred to him There is no need for thy intermedling any further in the Matter  said the Countess  thy Business is not so much as to remember his Name in my Presence Leave the rest to my Care and I will acquit my self in such a manner that no blame shall be laid at my Door  If it were possible  reply'd  Albine  after having paused a while  to doubt of what one sees with  ones own Eyes I must confess to you Madam I should scarce so absolutely Condemn the Earl of  Warwick  without being heard None but such mean and selfinteressed Souls as thine  said the Countess  can be Guilty of thus imposing upon themselves As to my self who give Thanks to God have nothing in me that Resembles thee have fix'd my Resolutions to Hate him for ever and not to see him again whilst I live You will meet with no small difficulties to keep either of these Resolutions  reply'd  Albine 'Tis not an easie Matter to hate what one loves I love him  cry'd the Countess with some impatience  'Tis true I have admitted of his importunities and this is the only thing I have to accuse my self of and to reproach you How unfortunate are Persons of my Age  continued she  if they happen to have Women of so much Complaisance as yours Hadst thou given me a foresight of the Precipice I was going to I had stop'd in time to avoid the Danger and had not had any occasion now of finding my self betray'd But instead of giving me wholesome Advice thou madest it thy Business to make me sensible of the Merits and Passion of my Enemy  These various Reflections caused in her a Thousand Melancholly Thoughts which afflicted her to such a degree that not being in a condition to appear in any strange Conpany she went to Bed and  Albine  told the Family that having a most violent  Headach  she requir'd some Rest Her Husband who did not question but that it was an effect of her dissatisfaction was not very forward to see her being highly exasperated against her and had it not bin for the Chevalier  de Hereford  it would have come to a Rupture betwixt them  The Earl of  Pembrook  who bore a share in every thing that related to the Countess soon got Notice of her being ill of a  Consumptive Fever  attended with such Symptoms of Melancholly as seem'd to be past all hopes of a Cure and not doubting but that it was that Change of the Earl of  Warwick  that was the real Cause of it What an odd Story is here  cry'd he  She Writes to him a Rigorous Letter that she will not as much as hear any body Name him His good Fortune is such as to take the right Course and to Cure his Passion She no sooner knows it but is ready to run distracted But perhaps  continued he  this sudden Fire which Burns now with such violence in her Heart for the Earl of  Warwick  may be much abated if she meets with a Lover who's Passion is limited within the Bounds of Vertue such as she has always profess'd and 'tis possible that the Earl being too forward forced that rigorous answer from her As for my Part I fear nothing of that kind for as I love without hopes so I shall be well pleased provided she will not be displeased with me  There being a great Intimacy betwixt him and the Earl of  Devonshire  he took often the freedom of paying him a Visit at  Twittenham  which being a Village but a few Miles from  London  He ask'd leave of the King to go thither for some small time You will then see the Countess of  Devonshire said the King to him  I would have her come to Court again because I find her Beauty is much out of Order I know her Eyes are grown very hollow her Complexion and Lips Pale and that she is so Lean as scarce to be known to be the same Person Thus I see my self sufficiently Reveng'd upon her and to compleat it pray tell her that I intend privately  to Marry Madam  Grey  that I heap Favours upon Favours upon her that I love her most Tenderly and that if she had used me well she might Triumph'd at Court at Pleasure whereas now her Husband keeps her shut up in the Country  Your Majesty charges me with a Commission  said the Earl  which would easily break off my small Journey For how is it possible for me to put such hardships upon her If you are resolved to go thither  added the King  it must be to serve me as an Interview to her The Earl told him He would do it in the most Gentle way he could and so leaving the King's Apartment met with the Earl of  Warwick  as he was passing through the GuardChamber Having a mind to sound his Inclinations concerning his former Passion for the Countess I am a going  said he with a low Voice  to lye at the Lady  Anglesey  's this Night Have you any Commission to entrust me with The Earl being somewhat Surprized did not answer immediately but soon after told him he was a going to see a Fair  LittleLyrness  and that he envy'd not his Fortune You are angry my Lord  reply'd the Earl of  Pembrook and I find there is more of Passion than of Indifferency in that you say of the Countess of  Devonshire  You know but little  return'd the Earl coldly  if this is your real Sentiment Don't you know that I am all of a Piece and know not what Dissembling is The Earl of  Pembrook  having a mind to pry further into his Inclinations told him You think your self Cured when you are still very Sick I am not such a Novice  reply'd he  not to know my own Condition I read over her obliging Farewell every day and it is there I meet with what is sufficient to support my Reason  and to augment my Scorn Then you still stand in need of a Counterpoison  cry'd the Earl of  Pembrook you are not quite clear say what you will This is to insult over me  return'd the Earl with a serious look  Sure you take me for a mean Spirited Fellow I assure you I don't so much as think any more of her I knew she was Ill and I heard it not without some Satisfaction which sufficiently convinces me that Thanks to Heaven she has no farther Power over me It were happy for me  added he  could I be Cured now as well of my Hatred as I have bin of Love I should then have but little occasion to dispute with the King as I now do about Madam  Grey  and tho' he Adores her I don't question but to be Reveng'd of her first or last according as a favourable opportunity offers How  said the Earl of  Pembrook and do you still keep in remembrance what she did against you I shall never forgive her  said the Earl  till she has well suffer'd for it and till then I will give my self the Satisfaction of being the most Cruel of all her Enemies  By this time several Persons coming in to interrupt their Discourse the Earls of  Warwick  and  Pembrook  parted the last being extreamly well Satisfy'd at what he had heard his Rival say But scarce was got down the Stairs when hearing himself call'd by some body found it was the Earl of  Warwick  I Conjure you  said he to him  not to miss of this Opportunity of telling her how far I am bewitch'd to my new Mistress for I would have Madam  Devonshire  know that her Fetters are not everlasting that I had Power enough to change them nay that I am almost inconsolable to have ever worn them That is enough for me  said my Lord  Pembrook to tell her what will please her much And why  please her  said the Earl of  Warwick That is the least of my intention I am Satisfy'd  said the Earl of  Pembrook  with a Malicious Smile  She will be overjoy'd to hear you think of her no more The Earl of  Warwick  not being able to contain himself told him with a deep Sigh Alas my Lord how happy are you not to be in Love with this Cruel Woman I wou'd I never knew her or at least never lov'd her at the Price of half my Life But Farewell I must leave you the Recital of my weakness would prove to my Confusion  Having said these Words he went up to the King whilst the Earl of  Pembrook  remain'd immoveable leaning against the Wall quite confounded at the last Words of the Earl of  Warwick  not questioning but that he had flattered himself in vain 'Tis certain  said he to himself  he is still affected with the same Passion and 'tis nothing but selflove that makes him despise her who despises him For how is it possible that so Ardent a Passion should be quite extinguish'd at once Perhaps when the Countess Writ what she did it was not without the greatest violence to her self how can I tell whither not some indispensible Reasons obliged her to it O God What Torments do I endure What Obstacles am I likely to encounter What difficulties am I not to Surmount Whether am I a going My Fetters being already so weighty if I see the Countess and declare my Passion to her and she should be offended thereat should I not then be much more unfortunate than I am now  A Thousand objections came into his Head against the intended Journey to  Twittenham  but at last let my Treatment be what it will I shall have at least the Satisfaction of having declared my Passion to her so that if I suffer she'll know 'tis for  her I suffer and of all the Misfortunes this is greatest to Love and to Conceal it Whilst he was taking this Resolution he espy'd my Lord  Stanley  and ask'd him whether they should not go together to  Twittenham  He embraced the offer and they were received with singular kindness by the Earl of  Devonshire  who was very glad of good Company to divert his Spleen which most afflicted him when he was alone  The Earl of  Pembrook  did not see the Countess that Night because she did not stir out of her Chamber and if without being Guilty of ill Manners she could have refused the Visits of those that came to her Father's House she would have bin extreamly glad of it The Earl of  Pembrook  ask'd how she did and told my Lord  Stanley  to perswade her not to use so much Reservedness to him as she did to others Put her in mind  said he smiling  that it was upon her Command I left you in the quiet possession of the Fair  Lelia  and don't you think it not reasonable she should shew some particular Regard to me My Lord said she ought and promis'd to introduce him to his Sister's Apartment the next Morning so soon as she should be awake  To perform his Promise he went to a little Wood where the Earl had bin passing his time ever since daybreak near a Cool Spring where the Countess used often to divert her self He saw  Aurora  dissipating by degrees the darkness of the Night whilst the Sweet Singing Birds seem'd to revive Nature it self during the Coldness of the Morning when the Sun Beams being as yet feeble rather delighted than offended the Eyes The Earl address'd himself to the Stars and told them his Pain and Perplexity He would have thought his Condition sufficiently happy to find himself in the same place where  his admir'd Countess had her Habitation had she bin more sensible for him or less for another but this Reflection was like to kill him upon the spot had it not bin that he remembred those few cruel Words she writ to the Earl of  Warwick  This being the only Foundation whereon he built the hopes of his Success in the intended Declaration of his Love  My Lord  Stanley  finding him among a Set or kind of Arbour of Trees near a  Cascade  in a very pensive Posture told him I am sorry my Lord if I disturb your Thoughts because I am sensible your Mind is taken up with something that touches you very near The Earl of  Pembrook  sigh'd and without answering his Question only told him with a forc'd Smile That Indifferency was the happiest thing in the World I easily guess at your meaning  return'd my Lord  Stanley you are in Love and have reason of Complaint The Earl fearing he might dive too far into his Sentiments thought fit to divert him by making him his pretended Confident and relating to him an old Adventure of his as if it were one of a very late Date  I must own to you  said he  That to forget the ingrateful  Lelia  I resolv'd to enter into an Amorous Engagement in good earnest with a Lady who might really deserve it 'Twas not long before I got acquainted with a Widow a most Charming Creature who tho' she was pass'd the first Flower of her Youth yet still retain'd a thousand Beauties whose Lustre was encreas'd by her lively Wit and most engaging Conversation She gave me great Demonstrations of her Esteem tho' she pretended to a most severe Virtue but in hopes that time would produce more favourable Sentiments  in her I Courted her with all the Ardour and Application that could be But one Day happening to come to her House when she did not expect me I enter'd the Door and in a great Lookinglass that hung in her Bedchamber and faced the Entry I espy'd a certain young Pedaut who being lately come out of some UniversityColledge she had made a Tutor to her Son if you had but seen his lank greesy Hair you must have own'd he would make but a very lothsome Bedfellow for so Nice a Lady besides that his Face was so ugly as was enough to frighten me So away I went immediately but did not forget to write her every thing that Anger could inspire me with and to give her to understand the reason of it and my constant Aversion to such pretended Virtuous Ladies She touch'd to the quick and thinking it less Disadvantagious to make me her Confident than to let me have a sinister Opinion of her Virtue sent to me one of her Relations being the only Person that was Privy to her Marriage with this Fellow who gave me a full Account of it I protest to you that I was more surpriz'd at this than at the first but you may believe I made the best use of it  was to Cure my self of my Passion it being contrary to my Inclinations to love what I can't esteem However I am forced to offer constant Violences to my Heart and have taken a positive Resolution to avoid all Lady's as the Bane of our Tranquillity and whenever I feel but the least Inclination for any one I am sure I will never see her again whilst I live  You threaten the Fair Sex very hard and I believe more than you are able to perform  reply'd my Lord  Stanley I think we may both defie them  said the Earl abruptly  My Sister  will give you a favourable Reception  reply'd my Lord  if she be but acquainted with your Resolution How  return'd the Earl  Would she not have one Love that which is lovely No  added my Lord  she is such an Enemy of all manner of Gallantry that nothing can be more terrible than she to a Lover Come then let us go to see her and do you make her sensible of your rare Resolution Had my Lord bin sensible what Affections these Words caus'd in his Friend he would have acted with more Caution and he might soon have discover'd the Symptoms thereof in his very Eyes had he but look'd at him but little guessing at his Intentions he thought no further on the matter  Whilst the Earl of  Pembrook  was going towards the Countess's Apartment he was oppress'd with such a Confusion of Thoughts as is scarce to be express'd Are not my Chains already weighty enough  said he to himself  Must I go to see her to augment my Passion And can I flatter my self that the Earl of  Warwick  is absolutely indifferent to her 'Tis true she has writ to him in harsh Terms but alass this may be the effect of Anger Jealousy or some Error committed by him these things are soon pass'd by when a Person truly loves so that the Resolution I have taken of disclosing to her my Passion may prove perhaps the most fatal Action of my Life He was a thousand times upon the point of changing his dangerous Resolution but the Pleasure he propos'd to himself got the better over all the Considerations of Danger and thus as he was entring the Countess's BedChamber he had much ado to forbear running straightways to the Fair Lady's Bedside where she appear'd in a negligent Dress attired with nothing but her own Charms with somewhat a  Pale Countenance enough to discover her Grief but in the midst of her Languishment there appear'd still such a Lustre in her Eyes as prov'd dangerous in effect to all that beheld them  The Earl of  Pembrook  is come to tell you something that will charm you  said my Lord  Stanley  as he was entring her Chamber  He hates Love and flies all Opportunities relating to it he is got away from Court to seek for shelter here I am afraid I have not chosen my Ground very well to Fight in  reply'd the Earl interrupting him  But Madam my Lord talks at random he ought to tell you the Reasons that engag'd me into these Resolutions which I intend to justify to you alone Keep to your Resolution  reply'd the Countess  to love no more don't alter your Design and if my Brother would follow my Advice I would have him do so too I don't desire to Engage you whilst you have such a Second  said my Lord  Stanley  to his Sister  Adieu I am a going a Hunting and if I meet with some Solitary Place it may be I may bestow the Day there upon my Thoughts So he went out of the Room leaving the Earl at full Liberty to entertain the Countess 'Tis certain 'twas the only thing in the World the Earl was desirous of yet found himself at a stand for tho' he knew very well what he intended to say he knew not whether she would mind it so their Conversation was at first upon indifferent matters  By your Absence Madam  said he  the Court is robb'd of its chiefest Ornament every thing looks very Melancholly there since you have left it I used to appear there so seldom  reply'd she  that I can scarce be miss'd 'Tis far Madam from what you guess at  said he  the  King often speaks of you and the Earl of  Warwick  cannot forget you What is it you tell me my Lord  said she with a Blush  The King saw me by chance at a Seat near  Windsor  where he was receiv'd with that Respect as was due to his Person and has never look'd after me since The Earl came along with General  Talbot  to pay a Visit to my Lord  Devonshire  and I never saw him above twice or thrice in my Life I can't but conclude from what you say  added the Earl  that you have quite raz'd him out of your Memory and rejoice at it as at a Piece of good News  At these Words the Countess not questioning but that the same Letter which was restor'd to her by the  Chevalier de Hereford  was also faln into the Hands of the Earl of  Pembrook  she was so afflicted thereat as to break forth into Tears Oh  cry'd the Earl kneeling before her Bedside  What is it I see you are in Tears my Divine Countess you Weep This Happy Mortal has cost you many a Sigh Don't misconstrue my just Indignation by false Appearances  said she to him  and believe me that I hate the Earl of  Warwick  as he deserves You hate him Madam Yes I hate him  said she  the very Remembrance of him is insupportable to me He is still happier than I  reply'd the Earl sighing  you don't hate him till after having honour'd him with your particular Esteem whilst you look upon me with so indifferent an Eye as if I was not worth your Hatred But Madam  continu'd he  since he has bin so bold as to Love you and you have known it without being offended at it May not I be permitted to say that I feel for you all that Admiration the most passionate Respect and a most sincere Passion are able to inspire a Man with I don't propose to raise my  Fortune upon the Ruins of his or to deserve any thing at your Hands at the Price of his Destruction tho' he be a very dangerous Rival I have within me a certain Generosity that does not in the least agree with such Actions But give me leave to declare to you my real Sentiments they being such as will not wound your Virtue and the Flame of that great Light which affords us the satisfaction of the Day is not compos'd of a purer Matter than that which burns in my Heart My Lord  said the Countess interrupting him  you have taken too much the Advantage of the Confusion and Trouble you saw me in you have told me what highly displeases me and what convinces me more and more in my Opinion that there is not a more unfortunate Person upon Earth than my self Were the Earl of  Warwick  of a more honourable Temper than he is he would not have forgotten to tell you when he spoke of our Conversation that I never gave him any occasion of bragging of his good Fortune and that I omitted nothing to deliver my self from his Persecutions But that fatal Star which bestow'd upon me something of Beauty did it doubtless to my Destruction it would be more happy for me to be hated by all the World than to be belov'd after the same manner I am now But be it as it will my Lord I have too high an Esteem for you to quarrel with you I will forget every thing you told me provided you promise not to see me any more What an odd sort of Pardon is this Madam  reply'd he abruptly  What to promise to avoid seeing you No no I am not any more thus far Master of my own Actions as to engage my Word for a thing of such a nature Alas what is it I have not endur'd since I saw you in the Wood near  Chelsea  in the utmost Lustre of your Beauty You may talk what you please  answer'd the Countess  were I not in Bed I would leave you but my Mind is taken up with such variety of things that it is an easie matter for me not to hear you  This Indifferency or rather Slight more nearly affected the Earl than if she had broken out into violent Expressions Oh Madam  cry'd he  I am too sensible that you pursue your own Resolutions you can't persuade me that you hate Love but you may convince me with ease that you hate me 'Tis time to dye  continu'd he  I must dye and so bowing his Head to the Ground remain'd immoveable like a Man without his Senses The Countess fearing he might be surpriz'd upon his Knees near her Bedside desir'd him to take his Seat I am so unfortunate  said she to him  that even the most innocent things become criminal if they have any relation to me and I hope you will not augment my Pain by adding new ones to it The Earl took his Seat but spoke not one Word more so that this dumb Conversation beginning to prove tedious he arose on a sudden made a profound Reverence and so left her Chamber and immediately after the House finding himself not in a Condition to carry on matters there without danger of being discover'd by some of the Family in his Intentions  He came not to  London  till it was late that he might the better keep conceal'd for some Days in his own House which time he spent in endeavouring to calm the Tempest in his Mind After that he came to Court where he met with a favourable Reception from the King who ask'd him whether he had acquitted himself of the Commission he had charg'd him with The  Earl told him That he could find no Opportunity of speaking to her alone and that it seem'd as if she knew his Errand by her being so cautious in avoiding it She was not much in the wrong of it  said the King smiling  but you can't but own that she is much alter'd and so I am reveng'd of her The Earl of  Pembrook  who had reason enough to wish that his Master might think of her no more  reply'd  She was scarce to be known and that it seem'd almost not natural for so Handsome a Person to grow so Ugly Her extravagant Love for the Earl of  Warwick  is the cause of it  said the King  But do you imagine that she still loves him Sir  reply'd he  I had sight of her but one Moment she seem'd to be full of Grief but spoke not a Word of the Earl of  Warwick  He will not be concern'd at it  added the King  he loves her no more his predominant Passion is to plague Madam  Grey  he hates her mortally and would always persuade me that she is Unfaithful but I am too well acquainted with the cause of his Hatred to believe him I would have you tell him that I don't like it that every thing he says upon that Head appears suspicious to me and that if he will oblige me he shall make his Court to her  The Earl of  Pembrook  being very well inclin'd to execute the King's Command went immediately to the Earl of  Warwick  who receiv'd him with all the Marks of a tender Friendship What News do you bring me  said the Earl  from Madam  Devonshire  Is she still in the same Humour against me She is in so languishing a Condition  reply'd the Earl of  Pembrook that I believe she has not strength enough left to love or hate any thing and I never saw her but in Company where there was no Opportunity of talking of you I am overjoy'd you have no News to tell me from her  continu'd the Earl of  Warwick which might have stopt my Progress in what I have advanc'd within these few Days 'tis true my Lord I have almost quite forgot her I congratulate you  answer'd the Earl of  Pembrook  coldly  but can scarce believe you I have since made many serious Reflections upon every particular relating to that Affair  added the Earl of  Warwick and find nothing but matter of Trouble and Vexation in it You know what I have told you before upon that Head I never enjoy'd one Day with Content I was forc'd to hazard every thing to get sight of her but for one Moment and that even against her Consent I was surrounded by the King and the General on one side and by her Husband and Madam  Grey  on the other Judge what a sort of Entertainment this was for one not acquainted with Disappointments However I lov'd her too well to be check'd by these Difficulties none but her self could have alter'd my Resolution you know how she managed the matter and what a most gracious Farewel she bestow'd upon me whilst I suffer'd such a harsh Banishment upon her account All these Reasons have had such an Influence upon me that I begin to relish the Sweets of a real Indifferency add to this my Engagement with a lovely Person who treats me as well as the Countess did ill you can't but agree with me That I could not do better than to take a fix'd Resolution of consulting my own Repose  The Earl of  Pembrook  hearken'd to his Words with a great deal of Pleasure Oh  said he to himself  and why should the Fair Countess not be acquainted with the Earl of  Warwick  's Indifferency for her 'Tis possible a Noble and Generous Anger may plead in my behalf Then remembering the King's Command Believe me  said he  my Lord you should give a Visit to Madam  Grey  and if you can't prevail so far upon your self as to forgive her in good earnest do it at least in outward appearance 'tis no small Trouble to the King to see his Favourite and his Mistress always at open War and you talk of her to him in so disobliging a manner that instead of making your Court you displease him I am sensible of it as much as your self  reply'd the Earl  and know my self in the wrong to take so much pains to Cure him of a Passion which will carry him too far for his Glory I am also willing to own to you that I should scarce be so Zealous in the matter were it not to revenge my self for what she has done to me so tht as the Case stands I can do no otherwise than to be her declar'd Enemy After your return from  Caerleon reply'd the Earl of  Pembrook you gave your Word to the King That you would live in a good Correspondence with her And so I would  said he  did she use me well But is it not an odd thing that he is dissatisfy'd with me because I am sensible of her immensurable ambitious Designs You are prevented by Passion  reply'd the Earl of  Pembrook 'Tis hard to imagine that her Designs reach so high she being the Widow only of a private Gentleman No matter for that  said the Earl of  Warwick she to well knows her own strength So they parted The Earl of  Pembrook  being highly rejoic'd at what he had heard the Earl of  Warwick  confess during this Conversation so that thinking himself freed of a Dangerous Rival he made his Court to the King but did not neglect to infuse into the King such Sentiments concerning Madam  Grey  as might make him be upon his Guard  Whilst every thing was in Tranquillity at Court fresh matter of Vexation arose at  Twittenham  The Chevalier  de Hereford  we have had occasion to mention before being of the same Family with the Earl of  Devonshire  a mutual Confidence and Friendship had bin contracted betwixt them But to render this durable the Chevalier must either never have seen the Countess of  Devonshire  or prov'd less sensible of her Charms He look'd upon the first beginning of his Passion only as an Effect of Compassion for her knowing that a Woman of so haughty a Temper as she must needs resent highly the unjust Jealousies of a Husband When he saw the Letter she writ to the Earl of  Warwick  this augmented his Esteem seeing she intended to check his Passion and that if she had a particular Value for him before others her Heart nevertheless had kept it self within the strictest Rules of her Duty These confus'd Thoughts by degrees being met in good Order he look'd upon the Countess as the most Beautiful Person in the World who being shut up in the Country might by little and little be accustom'd to hearken to his Passion  'Twas this that made him so anxious in taking that occasion of setting her at Variance with the Earl of  Warwick  for a Secret Lover has gain'd a good Step if he can remove the Person belov'd by his Mistress Every thing succeeded according to his desire my Lady  Devonshire  misled by the Honourable deportment of the Chevalier conceiv'd a Hatred against the Earl of  Warwick  she detested his Perfidiousness as on the other Hand she thought her self oblig'd to the Chevalier for having restor'd her Letter to her This Obligation join'd to the Confidence her Lord put in him induc'd her to see him frequently and even to talk to him with an absolute sincerity  Several Months pass'd thus the Chevalier being not as yet fully acquainted with his own Sentiments I told you before he thought it was only Esteem and Compassion that engag'd him in her Interest to inveigh against the Earl of  Warwick  and make her raze him out of her Remembrance But Love is an Evil that will not lye conceal'd he began to be sensible that he was catch'd in the Snare himself he did all he could to Cure his Passion but it prov'd too late On the other Hand the Countess shewing him a Thousand innocent Marks of her Friendship to acquire his each of these prov'd a Snare wherein the Chevalier saw himself entangled past all Hopes of getting out For upon his return  London  where he intended to stay for some time every thing prov'd as irksome to him as if he had bin in a strange Country his only satisfaction in the World now being to see the Countess  All this while he loaded himself with a Thousand Reproaches to abuse thus the Friendship of the Earl of  Devonshire  his Dear Kinsman who had open'd his very Bosom to him No would he cry sometimes I will see her no more I will choose a voluntary Banishment from that House where my Reception is such as to disturb all my Repose He staid for some time at  London  and thought to divert himself with appearing constantly at Court but all this was unpleasing to him he was forced in spite of himself to return to my Lord  Devonshire  's Whilst he was thus struggling with the most violent Passions that ever a Man did he fell most dangerously ill at  Twittenham  the Countess being just then upon her Recovery and of a very grateful Temper being sensible also that to take Care of the Chevalier  was in effect to oblige her Husband would sit whole Days together by his Bedside which piece of Goodness was so far from accelerating his Cure that as often as she came into the Chamber his Fever encreas'd At last his Condition became so dangerous that the Physitians advis'd him to be carry'd to  London  The Countess of  Devonshire  being the first who told him of the Physitians Advice she perceiv'd him to be highly concern'd thereat What is it makes your Countenance change thus  says she  Madam  reply'd he  I am very ready to obey you and to disclose to you the cause which has reduc'd me to this Condition you see me in 'Tis the Pain I feel of being remov'd out of your Sight without any Hopes of ever returning hither again Don't tell me a thing that must needs afflict me  reply'd she  your Health is not in so desperate a State we shall see one another again Chevalier and I shall be overjoy'd at it I should dye too Happy  said he  durst I flatter my self with this Hope but you will soon Hate me Madam when I have declar'd to you That I Love you Yes  added he  I Love you to such a degree that the Violence I have offer'd to my self not to disclose it is that which has reduc'd me to that State you see me in If you have any Remnants of Compassion to plead in my behalf conceal from me your Resentment or rather don't conceive a Hatred Divine Countess against one whose Death will be a suffering Revenge to you  He said no more after having utter'd these few Words his Eyes seeming as if he look'd for Mercy in Madam  Devonshire  's Face and she actually look'd upon him with more Compassion than Anger I have some Obligations to you Chevalier  said she  I can't forget in spite of the Displeasure you give me at this time but he assur'd I never receiv'd any that affected me more Alas I consider'd you as a faithful Friend in whose Conversation I might find some Relief against those Vexations which have so sensibly afflicted me for some time past and now I must lose you Oh that unfortune Beauty which to another would prove an Object of Satisfaction is to me a constant Source of Pain which are renew'd every Day to me The abundance of Tears that fell from her Fair Eyes intermix'd with Sobs and Sighs would not give her leave to say more But the Chevalier taking the Word What is it I see  cry'd he  Madam you Cry and I am in some measure the occasion of it Will my Death be a sufficient Expiation of my Crime I don't wish for your Death  reply'd she  but for your Cure and so perfect a Cure that you may never speak to me again in the same manner as you did just now I have not power enough to make you such a Promise  said he  it will be much easier for me to avoid the Sight of you than to stifle a Passion I shall be forc'd to cherish in spite of all your Rigour Why was not I made the Earl of  Warwick  Is it possible  said the Countess not without some Symptoms of Indignation  that if you have those Sentiments for me you just now discover'd Is it possible I say you should envy the Fortune of him who is the most Cruel Enemy I have in the World Alas Madam  said he to her  you deceive your self if you believe you hate my Lord  Warwick  that Secret Concern I had in diving into your real Sentiments has often made me speak of him without any Diffidence or Dissimulation I have bin too sensible that he is still very dear to you and it has often brought me to the Brink of Despair  but Madam the Esteem I bore you made me keep Silence I durst not make you sensible of your own Sentiments my fear of discomposing or displeasing you was such an untrespassable Law to me as to fain that I did not perceive the ascendant he got over your Heart and tho' I was very assiduous in removing those Jealousies which so much afflicted the Earl of  Devonshire  I talk'd to him against my own Knowledge but I spoke to him Madam for your Repose being ready at the same time to sacrifice all mine to yours  Tho' you are very much mistaken in your Guess  said the Countess interrupting him  I think my self nevertheless oblig'd to your Conduct both in respect of my Husband and my self but I can assure you were you less prejudic'd than you are or better acquainted with my present Inclinations you would not accuse me as you do of so much Weakness to return any favourable Sentiments for the most dishonourable Person in the World Nay I would sooner have pardon'd him for having contriv'd my Death than for having endeavour'd to stain my Reputation in the World Then you don't love him  reply'd the Chevalier sighing  I hate him pass'd all recovery  said she  If it be so  continu'd he  May I hope for nothing from your Compassion You may be assur'd  answer'd she  that I will forget every thing you told me to Day provided you give me no reason of Complaint for the future I rather will choose a voluntary Exile  said he  I am not in a Condition to keep my Word upon that point as you require I must then Madam forbear seeing you and the Earl of  Devonshire  will perhaps not be in a better Humour for I have often calm'd his Rage and no other but my self would have known how to  merit something from you upon that score But  said she interrupting him  Is it possible you should bare so little respect to him as to talk to me at the rate you do I protest to you I can scarce believe it and that of all Mankind who are subject to such Frailties you were the last one I suspected in that kind I can't justify my Conduct  said he  if it is a Crime Madam I suppose I shall soon expiate it by the Loss of a Life that has bin for a long time odious to me He had scarce utter'd these last Words when falling into a Swoon all his Senses left him and the Countess divided betwixt Compassion and Resentment call'd for Help but at the same time left the Room and retir'd to her own Chamber where she found  Albine  who then had not as yet forfeited all her Credit with her  Alas  Albine said she to her full of Trouble  what a strange Scene has bin acted here my Misfortunes instead of diminishing encrease every Moment The  Chevalier de Hereford  has made to me such a Declaration as puts me quite beyond my self him I look'd upon as my best Friend but he proves as indiscreet as the Earl of  Pembrook  besides I am under a great Dilemma how to deal with him for if I use him roughly he will perhaps be revengeful and you know my Lord hearkens to and believes every thing he says if I shew him some Complaisance What Construction will he make of my Indulgence and what is it I must not fear hereafter This will render my Condition but worse and after all Am I Mistress of my own Heart Of that Heart I say so often revolts against all the Dictates of my Reason Which is so very frail as to make me to this Day discover some Merit in my most Mortal Enemy Yes  Albine  'Tis not is my power to hate the Earl of  Warwick  How Happy am I in not seeing  him How much am I in Love with this Solitude 'Tis true I suffer here but no matter as long as I preserve here my Innocency  Hitherto  Albine  durst not speak in behalf of the Earl of  Warwick  for her Mistress seeming so highly exasperated against him she did not believe he had retain'd so good a Place in her Heart as she found he did so she would not neglect this Opportunity Perhaps  said she  Madam the Earl is not so guilty as he has bin represented to you Remember now it was the Chevalier  de Hereford  who render'd him thus Criminal in your Eyes and is it not very probable that at that very time he might have his Secret Designs of ruining him in your Opinion No no  cry'd the Countess  I remain unalterable in respect to the Earl of  Warwick  his Behaviour has bin such that I must be Blinder than any Woman in the World to be deceiv'd in it Neither do I deceive my self  continu'd she  I only deplore the Excess of my Misfortunes that I should meet with so many Enemies amongst those very Persons who owe me the most Respect She then kept Silence in a pensive Posture without giving the least Attention or Answer to what  Albine  further told her  Immediately after the Earl of  Devonshire  coming into the Chamber and seeing the dangerous State of his Kinsman was much afflicted thereat and being the only Person whom he had made the Confident of his Jealousy he resolv'd to go along with him to  London  and to stay there till his full Recovery He told the Countess that he intended to go to  London  because he should not enjoy himself in the Country if he should let him go alone and that if his Distemper should prove of any long Continuance he desir'd Madam  Anglesey  and her to come to Town likewise She answer'd coldly that he might have dispens'd himself from going by committing him to the Care of some trusty Person But that he was his own Master and that her Credit was so inconsiderable with him that she durst not attempt to engage him to stay at  Twittenham  He gave her a surly Look and without speaking one Word went out of the Room Soon after hearing a Noise in the Court she found it was the Chevalier  de Hereford  and the Earl of  Devonshire  both upon their Departure for  London  the first in a HorseLitter and the other in his Coach They were no sooner arriv'd there but the Earls of  Warwick  and  Pembrook  being the first that got Notice thereof this serv'd to revive their Passions For the Earl of  Warwick  could not flatter himself to speak to the Countess as long as her Husband  Argus  like watch'd her himself and the Earl of  Pembrook  imagin'd that being now at Liberty she would enjoy the Advantage thereof and afford him a more favourable Reception  He was so far from making the least Mistery of his intended Journey to  Twittenham  that he visited the Earl of  Devonshire  upon that account who gave him some Letters to his Lady However he conceal'd it from the Earl of  Warwick  whom he still look'd upon as his Rival notwithstanding the Hatred he bore to Madam  Grey  and the Pains he took to encompass her Ruin seem'd to divert his Passion a contrary way As she was not ignorant of all the Steps he took for that end and on her side repay'd him in the same Coin the King was constantly troubled with the Complaints of his Favourite against his Mistress and with hers against him He was engag'd in the same Interest with Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  a Lady of Quality and  of extraordinary Beauty The King whilst he was yet Earl of  Marche  enter'd into an Amorous Intrigue with her which was not interrupted by the Lustre of his Crown but the Charms both of Mind and Body join'd in the Person of Madam  Grey  did not a little dazzle and prevail over those of the young Mrs  Lucy  She resented the matter like an injur'd Mistress and would frequently engage the Earl of  Warwick  to give the King an account of the sinister Conduct of Madam  Grey  But this coming from a suspected Hand whom he knew to be her Enemy the King would say This lovely Widow is faithful to me Why would you have me check my Passion for her And who can you think of should be the Person she would prefer before me If Love and Reason did always go Hand in Hand  reply'd the Earl  your Majesty might rest assur'd that Madam  Grey  was sensible of her Good Fortune and that what I say against her was not consonant to Truth but Sir Love is Blind put her to the Trial and to such a one as may put it beyond all Doubt that you are in full Possession of her Heart or at least that may justify her Conduct The King tir'd out with these repeated Accusations told him one Day That he ow'd him no Obligation for the Trouble he gave himself I desire no Reward from your Majesty  reply'd he with a great deal of Frankness  but I shall at least have the satisfaction of having done my Duty Oh  said the King  your Zeal is very troublesome you may shew it upon other Occasions and not disturb me any further in Matters relating to my Mistress But all this did not check the Earl of  Warwick  's Resolution he often told the King many things of her which prov'd most generally false but at the same time furnish'd no small matter of Vexation to the Fair Widow  and what most of all afflicted her was that he was ready upon all Occasions to extol the Merits of Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  who she fear'd might one time or other alienate the King's Inclinations from her so that she was at open Enmity with the Earl  Thus matters went at Court when the Earl of  Devonshire  and the Chevalier  de Hereford  came to  London  The Earl of  Warwick  who still retain'd in his mind the Charms of the Countess of  Devonshire  and who most passionately desired to speak with her to reproach her Rigour and to recover his Credit with her if it were not entirely lost would certainly have given her a visit at  Twittenham  had it not bin that he look'd upon the destruction of Madam  Grey  as the most essential point on which depended both his Repose and Grandure He had already made such steps towards her removal from the King's Favour as would have proved infallible with any other Person except the King quite prepossessed with an high Opinion of her but being dayly in hopes of finding out something that might tend to the disadvantage of his Enemy he delay'd his Journey to  Twittenham  for some time  The Earl of  Pembrook  had also not laid aside his design being desirous to dive into those of the Earl of  Warwick  entred into discourse with him concerning my Lady  Devonshire  and the Earl not in the least imagining that he talk'd to his Rival told him without the least reserve that were it not for some business of the greatest Consequence he had at Court he would endeavour to see the fair Countess in Disguise  Pembrook  overjoy'd to find the Earl employ'd otherwise resolved not to lose a moment to accomplish the design he had  laid of carrying away the Countess to one of his Seats where he intended to keep her secretly as long as possibly he could without hearkening to or valuing the Danger which his Reason laid before him For he was in Love and that is all as can be said in his Justification  To encompass his end he had caused a kind of a Barge to be built finely Painted and Guilded after the same manner as they were said to be used in the  Indies  that so having nothing of the  European  Modal in it the Ladies might be surprized with its Novelty as well as with the Habit of him who was the pretended Master thereof who represented both in his Garb Actions and Looks an  English Indian  Merchant lately come from those Parts The Disguised Earl was no sooner got up the River with his Barge as far as  Twittenham  but he sent his Interpreter to invite the Countesses of  Anglesey  and  Devonshire  aboard her to take a view of what Rarities he had to dispose of Accordingly they came aboard her the next Day where their Eyes being glutted with great variety of Rich  Indian  Stuffs and other Rarities the Merchant told the young Countess That if She would come without her Mother the next day he would shew and sell her the Richest Silks that ever she saw in her Life And why would not you have my Mother come along with me  said she  Because  reply'd he  at my departure from the  Indies  I made a Vow to our Gods not to dispose of any of these richest Stuffs but to young Persons The Countess laugh'd at the Merchant's Fancy and did not come again the next following day so her Curiosity brought her thither the Day after attended only by some few of her Women  Whilst she was busie in viewing and picking out what she lik'd best they had Hoisted Sail and the Barge went forward apace before she perceiv'd it but dreaming of nothing ask'd the  Indian  Merchant Whether they were a going To the  Indies  Madam  reply'd he  The Emperor my Master sent me on purpose to carry you to him The Countess laugh'd at it taking it for a Jest but perceiving they went on as fast as they could she began to be frighten'd in good Earnest Don't think to carry me any further if you do I will kill my self The Earl of  Pembrook  seeing her so resolute told her Madam don't fear 'tis the Earl of  Warwick  who has sent me he must either see you or dye and he has order'd me to convey you to some delicious Place where you will see him more Amorous and more Faithful than ever  The Countess more enrag'd than before told him She would not see him while she liv'd and that before they could bring her to the Place where the Earl of  Warwick  was she would either Drown or Kill her self with her own Hands The Excess of her Despair discover'd it self both in her Countenance and Actions 'tis true she did not Cry but casting most furious Looks to the Water shew'd that she aim'd at the River The Earl of  Pembrook  lay at her Feet not daring to discover himself for fear of encreasing her Fury but did all he could to appease it telling her He would carry her back to  Twittenham  if she was positively bent upon it She vouchsafed him not one Word but on a sudden threw her self into the  Thames  Good God What a surprize was this to her Passionate Lover He little thought she would have taken so fatal a Resolution and now despising his own Life leap'd in after her Being a  good Swimmer he soon got hold of her Gown as she was rising in the Water but not withstanding this they had both bin drown'd together had not some of their Watermen come timely to their assistance  The Women of her Attendence seeing their Mistress without Sense or Motion sent forth most doleful Cries to Heaven And the Earl of  Pembrook  seeing that since the Plot would not take under the Name of the Earl of  Warwick  there was but little Hopes for him resolv'd without discovering himself to set the Countess down where he had taken her up Madam  said he to her after she was come to her self again  you need not have thus hazarded your Life by throwing your self into the River to force me to turn back to  Twittenham  our Intention was to make you Happy but since you're against it there is no reason we should incur your Hatred when our Business was to deserve your Goodwill Live Madam Live for a Jealous Husband fly your truest Friend 'tis your ill Star that Rules you and you will have occasion enough to repent of it hereafter Away away Impostor  said she  go and try your Skill upon some less Virtuous or more Credulous Person than my self and thank Heavens I am of the weaker Sex or else I would make you feel the Effects of my just Resentment for the Game you were going to play me Whilst they were talking thus they were got so near the Bank of the River that by the help of a long Plank the Countess and her Women could get conveniently out of the Barge the Earl of  Pembrook  having chang'd his  Indian  Habit for that of an  European  did the same not long after on the opposite Side and Night approaching gave them an Opportunity of unloading the Cargo and  having set Fire to the Vessel they all got to  London  without which they might have soon bin discover'd and taken by the Country People  In effect the Countess of  Devonshire  her self immediately prepar'd her self against the ill Consequences which she foresaw would attend this Attempt For some of the Inhabitants of  Twittenham  had seen her go into the Barge which immediately made the best of her Way down the River others had seen her plunge her self into the River and the  Indian  Merchant after her all which causing no small surprize the News thereof was soon carry'd to the Earl of  Anglesey  The old Countess uneasie to know what was become of her Daughter run to the Riverside where she found her Wet all over just after she was scarce well got out of the Boat and ask'd her very abruptly What a fine Walk she had taken The young Countess appear'd much discompos'd which creating a Suspicion in her Mother she told her without staying for her Answer She had play'd some Trick of Youth wherein Love had a greater Share than Reason I protest to you Madam  reply'd the Countess of  Devonshire you do me the greatest piece of Injustice in the World you have taken a Prejudice against me were it not so you would believe what I am a going to relate to you concerning this Adventure but I am almost assured you will not give credit to what I say You ought not to be Judge of my Thoughts  answer'd my Lady  Anglesey speak only and I shall soon guess whether you are sincere or not In the Condition I am now in  added she  it will not be proper to give the whole Recital thereof immediately but I will justify my self when we  come to your Apartment So they got into the Coach the young Countess being in such a Confusion as if she had bin actually Guilty tho' every thing consider'd especially her attempting to drown her self there was but little cause of suspecting her to have had a Hand in the Plot  She was no sooner got Home but she went to Bed where she felt her Mind distracted with a Thousand Reflections concerning the Earl of  Warwick  the attempt he had made appearing to her unpardonable according to the Rules of  Virtue  and  Good Manners  To carry away a marry'd Lady of her Quality and Conduct appear'd to be so Presumptuous an Action as could not take rise but from a Love without Bounds She fancy'd she saw him at her Feet vowing an Eternal Respect to her and to excuse himself on account of his Love to have bin wanting in it Notwithstanding which she remain'd much exasperated against him How to carry me away by force  said she to the old  Albine what an Opinion must he have of me And if he has How can he Love me But if he thinks well of me Which way could he suppose I would remain as much as one Moment in his Power Alas  continu'd she  all what has happen'd will be laid at my Door and at that very time I endeavour to forget the Earl of  Warwick  and even deny my self the Pleasure of thinking of him they will imagine that I was willing to follow him to some solitary Place How Happy had I bin  added she  had I not bin sav'd from the Danger I underwent this very Day it would have sav'd me a World of disgrace during the whole Course of my Miserable Life Having spoken  these Words she cry'd most bitterly  Albine  then taking the Liberty to interrupt her 'Twould be unjust  said she  to charge you with a thing you have no share in No Madam don't disturb your self your Innocence will confound your Enemies and if the Earl of  Warwick  be never so much irritated against you he can't but admire and publish your Vertue Lovers in their Anger give an but indifferent Character of their Mistresses besides whatever he can say of me will be look'd upon as suspicious But  Albine  What will the Earl of  Devonshire  What will my Mother think of it I am sure they will judge me guilty Oh fatal Day to my Repose Oh cursed Attempt What is it I have committed to draw this Misfortune upon me  Whilst she was in this Agony the Countess of  Anglesey  came into the Room the Confusion she observ'd in her at first meeting near the Riverside had made her resolve to go to the utmost extremity with her Daughter but upon further Considerations thought it best to shut her self up for some time in her Chamber to restore to her Mind that Tranquillity she thought absolutely requisite in an Affair of this Nature The young Countess perceiving her to be pretty Calm her fear was chang'd into a reasonable Confidence so kissing her Mother's Hand several times she gave her a sincere Account of the whole Transaction and notwithstanding her Inclinations for the Earl of  Warwick  did not forget to tell her that he was the Author of it believ'd it was sufficient to speak the Truth to perswade her Mother that she did so but the old Countess recalling to her Mind the Picture dropt out of the Earl's Pocket with many other  Circumstances which made her then suspect a Correspondence betwixt them now thought she was fully convinc'd that her Daughter had the Misfortune of being in Love and to be belov'd Her austere Temper could not suffer the foresight of the Dangers she suppos'd her Daughter would be expos'd to so that instead of Condoling her she broke out into Reproaches She told her The Confession she had made her seem'd to her an affect only of Constraint since she had told her nothing but what must be divulg'd a course But that she could very easily see through that affected Air of Simplicity and Ingenuity That she might rest assur'd she would always side with my Lord  Devonshire  to keep her under seeing she had bin so unfortunate as to suffer her self to be led away by such Sentiments as must make her Blush The young Countess remain'd so highly afflicted at the Construction her Mother upon put her sincere Confession that she was not able to speak one Word more in her own behalf Her Silence serving only to accomplish her Mother's suspicions against her she left her convinc'd as she thought that the Earl of  Warwick  had not made this Attempt without her Consent After all this tho' the Countess of  Anglesey  judg'd her Daughter guilty of this Error she was too Wise a Woman not to take all possible Precautions to conceal it from the Earl of  Devonshire  she was willing to reduce her Daughter within Bounds without being accessary to her Ruin  In the mean while the Earl of  Devonshire  had scarce ever bin at  Twittenham  the Illness of the Chevalier his Friendship for him and his Indifferency for his Wife kept him constantly in  London  He attended constantly at Court and had he not bin sensible that the Countess was the most Lovely Person in the World he might perhaps have look'd out for another Engagement but there are certain Charms the Characters whereof are indelible Thus he might perhaps never have heard of the Attempt made upon his Wife had not the Earl of  Pembrook  after his return to  London  distracted with Spleen and Malice resolv'd to find out the Cure of his Passion in his Continual Application of making his Fortune For tho' the King had a peculiar regard to him he might have bin much more in his Favour had he taken the true Course for it But his LovePassion for the Countess being to him instead of every thing he took more Pleasure to employ his Thoughts upon her in his Closet than to pursue his Advantage by attending constantly at Court  He now began to relent at the time he had lost and the desire he had of being reveng'd of the Earl of  Warwick  who stood betwixt him and the King's absolute Favour made him enter into a strict Friendship with  Edward Woodwill  Earl of  Rivers  a Person more remarkable for his high Deserts than for his being the Brother of the  Fair Widow  For the rest his Fortune being not very considerable and the Earl of  Pembrook  who was one of the Richest Lords in the Kingdom making him a sharer in his whole Fortune this Act of Generosity so far affected Madam  Grey  that she thought the Earl wanted nothing to make him Compleat in her Eyes than to have an extream Aversion to the Earl of  Warwick  The Earl also had given her to understand that had he met with a less Rival in his Way than the King he should have made his Addresses to her and as  she was for nothing less than a Match she could have wish'd he had bin her Spouse he being a Person well shap'd magnificent and engaging in Conversation so that every thing concurr'd to settle a good Correspondence betwixt them  The Earl of  Pembrook  knew very well what subject of Complaint Madam  Grey  had against the Earl of  Warwick  and endeavour'd to hate him as much as she did having perhaps as pressing Reasons for it as she Among other things he took delight to relate to her as if it had bin a true Story the Attempt that Earl had made for carrying Madam  Devonshire  away without her Consent he would give her a Description of the Boat with some other Circumstances that attended this Enterprize as he pretended  viz  How by Mischance she fell into the River which broke all their Measures Madam  Grey  was surpriz'd to understand that so unaccountable an Action perform'd within Eight or Nine Miles of  London  should have made not the least Noise and that the Earl of  Devonshire  who was the Person most concern'd therein should be so little acquainted with it as to continue at Court she was no less surpriz'd at the Earl of  Warwick  He had in all Appearance made all his Applications to his new Mistress he had fix'd his Business and Pleasures in the same Place his whole Deportment and Air appear'd altogether compos'd Is it possible  said she  a Man should be so perfect a Master in the Art of Dissimulation Who could have suspected him whilst he Feasts all the Ladies at Court and is scarce ever out of their Company he should contrive how to carry away one In short it being agreed betwixt her and the Earl of  Pembrook  to divulge  the thing he gave her a full Account of all the Particulars relating to it And who could better do it than himself Nothing was omitted as she was a declar'd Enemy of the Earl of  Warwick  's She told the King of it who shew'd a greater Concern thereat than she desired Is it possible  said he  that a Person of his Capacity and Extraction should thus far bid Farewel to Reason as to seek thus his own Destruction for ever If she had once taken a Resolution to allow her self full Liberty Why did not she pitch upon my Heart before that of so indiscreet and inconstant a Man These Words being not very pleasing to the  Fair Widow  she Blush'd more than once but thought it best to say nothing  The King was so full of this News that the first time he saw the Earl of  Warwick  he spoke to him of it and the Earl being much surpriz'd thereat the King thought it had bin fain'd to avoid to come to a sincere Confession so that there wanted but little of his being in a great Passion and as the Earl of  Warwick  could not devise how such an Adventure wherein he had not the least share should be laid to his Charge he was so taken up with his Thoughts thereupon that not observing the King was in Earnest he turn'd the whole Story into Ridicule tho' at the same time he resolv'd to find out the bottom of the Design On the other Hand Madam  Grey  's Hatred to the Countess of  Devonshire  was such as not to suffer her to let slip so fair an Opportunity of revenging her Quarrel She took effectual Care to make the Earl of  Devonshire  acquainted with what had happen'd at  Twittenham  and as he was very apt to believe his own Misfortune he communicated it to the  Chevalier  de Heresord  who bore his full share in his Afflictions whilst the Earl of  Pembrook  kept the Key of the whole Secret in his own Hands 'Twas he that had the satisfaction of seeing so many Persons concern'd in the Interest of my Lady  Devonshire  reduc'd almost to Despair and himself thus reveng'd for her Cruel Treatment Tho' it is certain he would scarce have carry'd the Matter so far had it not bin to oblige Madam  Grey  for whom he began already to have a most singular Esteem  The Earl of  Warwick  once more felt the true Symptoms of Jealousy He thought himself cur'd of his Passion he amused himself with another not without some satisfaction but now found himself more afflicted and more unfortunate than ever For supposing no otherwise than that he had bin slighted by the Countess because she was engag'd with another Lover he had a Thousand Chimera's in his Head upon that account which continually tormented him What Projects of Vengeance did he not contrive Sometimes he was for advising the Earl of  Devonshire  how to deal with his Wife sometimes for finding out his Rival to Stab him before the Countess's Face and at last concluded that this Attempt had in it something so bold and irregular that he ought to reproach himself for retaining the least Esteem in regard of a Person who could expose her self to such an Adventure The Earl of  Pembrook  ambitious to triumph over his Rival went to give him a Visit and the Earl of  Warwick  impatient to see and tell him of the Attempt made upon the Countess of  Devonshire  and how it was laid at his door scarce would give him time to shut the Door of the Closet 'Tis true  said the Earl of  Pembrook you are charg'd with it and  truly it seems not very extraordinary if such a  Paris  as you should Ravish such a  Hellena  as she is If even I lov'd her still I should be too much concern'd for her Reputation to expose her thus but as I don't Love her any more it seems Extravagant to lay a thing to my Charge an Action of so nice a Nature What then can it be  added the Earl of  Pembrook that could raise this Suspicion of the thing being transacted by your Orders 'Tis that what I am ignorant of and what I will endeavour to find out  said the Earl  and you must assist me in it since I hope that in confessing your self a Friend to Madam  Grey  to such a Degree as you do you may nevertheless continue in the same Tye of Friendship with me as before The Earl of  Pembrook  told him that he would sooner renounce her than his Friendship that he must own that when he first heard the Relation of what had happen'd at  Twittenham  he had believ'd it as all the rest did but that since he desir'd it he would endeavour to find it out Thus they parted like the best Friends in the World  The End of the First Part  MEMOIRS OF THE Earl of  WARWICK  PART II  IN the mean while the  Chevalier de Hereford  being sooner recovered of his Illness than of his Passion for the Countess of  Devonshire  and not able to resist this Despair occasion'd by the news of the Attempt made upon the said Countess thought of nothing more than how to satisfie his own Revenge under the pretence of espousing the Earl of  Devonshire  's Quarrel Don't love any things cruel Woman's Love nothing would he say often by himself the misfortune of my Rivals will he an allaying to my sufferings but don't fancy you are at liberty to make so unfair a Choice for I will never suffer the E of  Warwick  to enjoy alone the Felicity of pleasing you What projects did not he frame upon that account Alas unfortunate Countess whose Vertue and Innocence were not sufficient to protect her against the furious assaults  of her Husband and her Adversary The more she was beloved the more she was reputed gui  y and the more they set their Engines at work against her The Earl of  Devonshire  and the  Chevalier de Hereford  going together to  Twhittenham  upon their Approach to that Seat where the Countess was were seized with so furious a Resentment that to calm their spirits they thought it necessary to stop for some time in a little Wood It being after Sun set and pretty cool they alighted and seated themselves under the Trees after a few minutes silence the Earl addressed himself thus to the Chevalier  I hope you will now no more oppose my just resentment and vengeance I hope I may now without injustice Cloister up for ever this unfaithful Woman and treat her in such a manner as the affront she has put upon me deserves I should not be well pleased my Lord  reply'd the Chevalier  to see you otherwise disposed than now you are There is no Den dark enough for your Wife you must chain her like a little Lioness and make her taste the sowre sawce I am afraid of her Mother's tenderness for her  added the Earl  'Tis not likely she will suffer her House to be made a Prison for her Daughter My Lord  Stanley  will take his Sister's part and it will be but ill becoming my quality to aim at such a thing without being able to go thro' with it What you say is very judiciously considered  reply'd the Chevalier  but you must bring them over to your side What can they say against it when you tell them that you are inform'd of her ill conduct that this late attempt makes a great noise at Court that you are scoff'd at by the Earl of  Warwick  and that your Enemies triumph over your Misfortunes 'Tis an easie matter to find excuses to make up a breach in a Family but believe me since it has  once made so much noise we will not be over cautious we will carry away in our turn and we will be too nimble for her Friends  The Chevalier highly approved his Resolution and it was pretty late before they left off talking The Countess of  Devonshire  used almost every day to walk the same Wood there to condole her disgrace and to give vent to her Grief Darkness and Silence seeming to afford her some Comfort in her present Circumstances Tho' her Mother had restrained her within very narrow bounds she had nevertheless allow'd her the liberty of withdrawing at some distance from those that attended her and to tarry by her self as long as she thought convenient The same chance that had directed the Earl of  Devonshire  and his Kinsman very near to the place where she was seated would have it so that they should not see her and that she at the same time should hear every thing they discoursed together for tho' they talk'd not very loud yet being separated from them only by a number of thick Hedges or Shrubs or single Trees they might have easily seen her It was scarce to be determined which was the greatest her despair or surprize she found her misfortunes to augment by a thousand additional circumstances one after another she now found to her cost that it was not enough to be innocent to avoid being accused or persecuted she was sensible she should furnish matter sufficient to the world to censure her Conduct and she was convinced above all that her Husband was going to take violent resolutions against her and that the Chevalier  de Hereford  being exasperated against her took this opportunity of being revenged for the indifferency she had shewn him she at last was forced to see that the Earl of  Warwick  who had  drawn upon her so many misfortunes and who was acquainted better than any other Man in the Court with what she had been capable of doing rather than fall into his hands remain'd an idle Spectator on the injustices offered to her  These various reflections crouding in upon her Spirits she was so confounded that at last she resolved to abide the thunderbolt that was striking at her head and to suffer her self to be carry'd whither the Earl of  Devonshire  should think convenient  What matters it  said she  whether I die in a Tower or in a Den whether I am made away by Dagger or Poyson Let me be carry'd where I will let my Death or Destiny what it will my comfort will be in a good conscience I shall be satisfy'd I have nothing to upbraid my self with and that I suffer undeservedly these misfortunes that befall me Is not all this sufficient to depart this life without regret  But soon after considering with her self that her Reputation lay at stake unless she could justifie her self and that she ought not to neglect any means to maintain her Innocence she took a firm resolution so to do looking upon it as a thing altogether worthy her care  'No said she I can't resolve to put Arms into my Enemy's hands If I make them Masters of my Destiny I shall never be in a condition to efface those suspicions the world has conceived against me is it not therefore much better to fly them and to conceal my self in some place or other Does not Heaven who thought fit I should overhear the Discourse betwixt my Husband and his Kinsman seem to ordain me to make the best use of it Every moment is now very precious to me having lost too many already But which way shall I secure my self how shall I  get out of the Wood without being perceived Good God what am I a going to do to get out of one Labyrinth I intangle my self in another'  She arose trembling all over not daring to stir from her place but her Husband and his Kinsman being altogether taken up in Discourse and the Wind making such a noise among the Leaves as not to permit them to hear what pass'd at a small distance from them She at last resolved to go and so moving gently from the place where she was made all the haste she could towards  Twittenham  but was under no small perplexity whether she was to take the conveniency of that River or to shelter her self in one of the adjacent Cottages but notwithstanding this irresolution and the foresight she had of what danger she intended to avoid and what hazard she was likely to run she made all the haste thence that possibly she could A Lady of her quality so young and so handsome as she to become a fugitive to fly like a Criminal to avoid the rage of her Husband could not but imagine that such a resolution would meet with a favourable construction in the World but the dread of a Prison was such to her that she thought nothing too much to avoid it  At the same time she heard some noise and looking about her found them to be two Horses without their Riders and not doubting but that they belonged to the Earl of  Devonshire  and the  Chevalier de Hereford  they proved actually the same and being got loose were going back towards  London  She got upon one of them as slipping the Bridle of the other for fear of being pursued she gallop'd away like lightning to lose no time being in a deadly fear and frightned at every thing she saw being a good Horsewoman  made a shirt to get to  London  sometime before day breaking and alighting from her Horse which she let loose went to one that had been her Nurse but was now a rich Citizen in  London  one whom she knew to be very faithful and absolutely devoted to her service However for fear of being discovered she got her immediately to buy a Suit of Mens Clothes which she wore and hid her long hair under a Cap Perriwigs being not in use in those days She appear'd so very handsome and well shaped that every body that saw her was struck with admiration for she carry'd much of Majesty in her whole Body in her Deportment appear'd a certain mixture of Haughtiness and sweetness and in her Eyes an uncommon lustre and vivacity of Spirit and this Disguise seem'd to be so natural in her that all the World might have been deceived in it Notwithstanding all this fearing least this might not prove a sufficient security against the vigilance of the Earl of  Devonshire  she told her Nurse what apprehensions she lay under and the whole cause thereof hereupon it was agreed betwixt them she should write to one Madam  Digby  her friend who lived in the Country to let her know she intended to send her Son to her House because he had been engaged in a Quarrel desiring she would give him a kind reception till the matter could be made up She having never seen this Son it was an easie matter to impose another upon her in his stead so my Lady  Devonshire  left  London  for fear of being seen by some Persons from whom she would carefully hide her self for that end she took no body along with her except an old trusty Servant of her Nurse's who having brought her to Madam  Digby  's House and so returned to  London  but before we speak of her reception we must return to  Thwittenham  My Lady  Devonshire  being accustomed to pass many hours together near a Brook which run cross the Wood 'twas very late before her family began to wonder at her stay so that nothing but the fear they conceived of her being seized with a sudden illness made them go in search after her they were not a little surprized when they met there with the Earl of  Devonshire  and his Kinsman who ask'd them whether they had not seen their Horses and commanded them to look after them whilst some obeyed their orders the rest run through all the places of the Wood whether the Countess used to retire most frequently but in vain she was gone as I told you just now and the Horse whom she had left behind finding himself without a Bridle was run away The Earl of  Devonshire  knew nothing of his Wife's having bin that Evening in the Wood so that when he was told that she was not to be found and that no body knew what was become of the Horses he was surprized to the highest degree and it came immediately into his head that the thing was not an effect of Chance but of her own choice and that she was more concern'd in it than any body else He discovered his Sentiments to the Chevalier who was not of his opinion but said She might perhaps be gone back alone to the House that their best way was to go thither since if they had a mind to pursue her they had no Horses so that he judged they could do no better than to go thither to be better inform'd concerning the whole matter  This being the first time the Earl of  Devonshire  and the  Chevalier  came to  Thwittenham  after what had happened upon the River every thing  look'd but with an indifferent aspect there my Lady  Anglesey  dreading her Husband's Anger in behalf of her Daughter sent her one of her Women to advise her not to stir out of her Chamber till she had sounded the Disposition of the Earl But the Person she had sent soon return'd and whispered her in the Ear that she was not there nor to be found any where having bin in the same Wood at the same time the Earl was there  This News proved the cause of fresh inquietudes and dreading all the sinister Events for her Daughter she could think of she changed colour several times and what pains she took to conceal the disturbance of her mind served only to discover it The Earl of  Devonshire  and the Chevalier  de Hereford  went not without their share in these troubles The last ask'd how the Countess did and whether she might be seen without incommoding her At these words my Lady  Anglesey  no longer able to keep silence  'Oh my Lord said she to her Son in law you know better than any body else what is become of your Wife I am not ignorant that you met with her because she comes not again what dreadful things have you told her you see she is not come back you don't do justice either to her Vertue or Merits'  The Earl turning coldly towards her told her only in a few words  'That had he met with the Countess they should have come home together that he was very uneasie at her absence and that he beg'd of her to let her be looked after and that he might go away with the rest'  So leaving the Room he gave orders to hasten to the Wood with lighted  Flambeaux  This happened very well for the Countess of  Devonshire  who whilst they spent their time in searching for her in the  Wood had leisure given her to secure her self After a long search at last word was brought to the Earl of  Devonshire  that certain fresh prints of a Horse's Hoof being traced in the more unfrequented parts of the Wood it was likely the Countess had taken that way in her flight The Earl and the Chevalier approving their opinions resolved to follow her themselves being unwilling to entrust any other  The Tract they follow'd brought them to a steep Hill where seeing no more signs of a Horse's Hoof and it being now daybreak they alighted and seated themselves near a Rivulet soon after they espied the Chavalier  de Hereford  's Horse running along full speed without Saddle or Bridle so that the Chevalier who had not shaken off his passion for the fair Countess thought he should have dy'd for her  ''Tis no otherwise my Lord cry'd he your Lady has laid violent hands upon her self on this Hill I just now have found out the whole mystery of it she did overhear our Discourse in the Wood and dreading your Revenge took the opportunity of saving her self upon my Horse Doubtless she let him run where he would for all her aim being to secure her self by flight she did not care whither Alas he has carried her into this Desart and thrown her out of the Saddle down one of the Precipices you see not far from hence'  Tho' you might have read grief in his Face the Earl was so intent upon what he said that he little minded it All Circumstances seem to concur to perswade me what you say to be true reply'd he but there are certain things that must not be divulged without an absolute  'certainty this is one of that kind If I should tell them my Wife lost her Life in such a  manner as you tell me I know not but that the World may have malice enough to suspect me to be the Author of it And if your Conjectures should prove false if she is alive and appears again I shall be ridiculed beyond what a man is able to bear 'Tis therefore my advice that after we have try'd all means to find her out to retire to a certain old Seat I have in the midst of a Wood 'till we hear further how matters go'  The  Chevalier  approving of this Proposition they continued to search in all the adjacent places but finding all their Endeavours to prove in vain went to a Village beyond the Hills when coming to a little House with those that attended them they dispatch'd some to  London  and to several other places to go in quest of the Countess  This done the Earl and the Chevalier remounted their Horses and as they were going along spoke not so much as one word to one another their hearts being so full that they did not know where to begin The Earl feared if you will believe him that his Wife had kill'd her self and the Chevalier dreaded it unto such a degree he had all the reason in the world to be convinced that he was not cured of his Passion as he had flattered himself he was Jealousy and Hatred had possessed the Earls mind Love and Fear were the predominant Passions in that of the Chevalier  'Is it possible said he you should lose the most amiable person in the world that you should know she is dead and should carry it off with so much Tranquility Who told you reply'd the Earl that I have lost her and that I enjoy so much Tranquillity I am the main Person in this Scene the part I am to act in it is so melancholy that it is not to be done indifferently  This is one of those kind of Afflictions which ought to be closed up within the inmost recesses of our Heart without exposing them to publick view'  'You might give me a share in your Misfortunes said the Chevalier our Friendship is such as not to allow of such a Reserve and I can't but be offended thereat I know not what your Opinion is reply'd the Earl coldly but this I know that you are disposed to accuse me unjustly'  He little dream't that the Chevalier cou'd have given him sufficient Reasons why he was more nearly concern'd in the Matter than himself but this had more consideration than to make him his Confidant in this Case his business being at this time to conceal from him the true Condition of his Heart  At last they came to the Earls House in the Wood a House built in the most unaccessible place of a Forest so that they wanted a Guide to conduct them thither the Earl having been there but once before in all his lifetime The Situation and Appearance of this old House was such that it seem'd to be chosen on purpose for a Seat and Nursery of Melancholy  Whilst they spent their time in this dismal Place the Earl of  Anglesey  and his Lady were ready to run Distracted at  Twittenham  at the uncertainty they lay under of what was become of their Daughter and the more they loved her the more ingenious were they to torment themselves The Earl of  Devonshire  whose Return they expected not without good Reason had taken another way with his Friend whence they conjectured that his Conscience accused him of some ill action done by him to his Wife and that therefore he would not abide the sight of them They caused search to be made for her in  all Corners and my Lady  Anglesey  finding herself every where uneasie left the Country and went to  London  but cou'd not leave her anxious Thoughts behind her  'Twas next to an impossibility that an Accident wherein so many Persons of the first Quality were concern'd shou'd not be known at Court The King was soon acquainted that the Countess cou'd not be found and that her Husband lay under a suspicion of having play'd her some ill Game He compassionated heartily the Misfortune of so lovely a Person and the Earl of  Warwick  happening to come into his Closet at that very moment whilst he was reflecting upon this odd Accident he told him My Lord  What have you not to answer for on account of my Lady  Devonshire  'tis believ'd she is Dead and that your extravagant Attempt to carry her away has been the occasion of it  The Earl was so surpriz'd thereat as not to be able to give an Answer for some time all the Merits and Charms of the Countess appear'd again so fresh in their utmost lustre to his Mind that the same Fires which was thought to have extinguish'd was rekindled at once  Don't imagine Sir  said he  that the Change you observe in my Face or the Confusion you see me in is owing to any thing I have to reproach myself on account of what your Majesty told me I never in my Life made the least attempt of carrying away the Countess  nay  I resented to the very Heart the weakness I found she was guilty of upon this Occasion for another Person but myself and I actually flattered myself that this consideration cured me of my Passion for her  but Sir  I am sensible of all the effects of her Charms by that direful Fear I am in never to see her again 'tis this that puts me into the most deplorable Condition in the World  His Eyes then were  covered with Tears which the King observing told him Warwick  you cry  No Sir reply'd the Earl  I am not guilty of so much weakness  Oh  cry on cry on  said he  'tis no Crime in a Lover that is cherish'd by his Mistress to bewail her I never had any occasion to consider her upon that Point  continued the Earl  for she always slighted or at least shew'd an indifferency for me which made me engage in another Amour and thought I had almost razed her out of my Heart but I must confess to your Majesty that the uncertainty of her Destiny puts me into such a degree of Despair I am not able to overcome Be it as it will  answer'd the King  whether you did intend to carry her away or whether you have been otherwise the cause of her Ruin I am concern'd for you and the best thing you can do is to wean yourself of your Passion  The Earl answered only with a deep Reverence I knowing it to be a thing he shou'd find very difficult to encompass and his Heart being quite overcome with Grief took his leave as soon as possibly he cou'd  As he was passing thro' the Privy Garden next adjacent to the Court he meets the Earl of  Pembrock  in a shady dark Walk and hoping to find some Consolation in discoursing his Friend upon this Subject matter he accosted him with so melancholy an Air that the other immediately perceived he had something of ill News to bring that very near concern'd him Alas My Lord said the Earl of  Warwick I shall see her no more Whom do you speak of  reply'd the Earl of  Pembrock  interrupting him  I can speak of no body but of her  continu'd the Earl of  Warwick could there have been any Misfortune like that of losing her  The Earl of  Pembrock  not apprehending what Person he meant to make him unfold the riddle told him  I understand you your young Mistress  is a going to leave the Court in order to be marry'd and you are afflicted at this Separation Would it please Heaven  cry'd my Lord  I had no other occasion of Grief you shou'd see me bear that with a great deal of courage but the Case is quite different in respect of the Countess of  Devonshire  'tis she 'tis she whose Destiny I lament her Husband having carry'd her away from her Father's House no body knows whether it being the general opinion that he has made her a sacrifice to his Jealousie and what is more I must bear the Blame as if I had been the occasion of it but 'tis not the publick Rumour but the loss of her Person in particular that affects me Don't you recal to Mind my Lord  continued he  that Majestick Air that noble and engaging Deportment those Charms which made her to be admired and respected by all the World with all these Perfections in the midst of her Native Country nay of her own Family there is no body appears in behalf of this poor Lady This Bugbear like me of a Husband keeps all her Friends in awe and his Cruelties gain a dreadful Respect among them Well I will be then the Man who by myself will venture at her Protection but I will do it to such a purpose that the Earl of  Devonshire  and all his adherents shall have occasion to remember me  He had scarce said these Words but quite transported with Choler and not remembring that he intended to consult with the Earl of  Pembroke  upon the Matter he did fly away like Lightning The Earl of  Pembroke  was not dissatisfy'd thereat since it saved him the trouble of counterfeiting and restraining his true Thoughts before him  As soon as the Earl of  Warwick  was got out of fight he lay down under a Tree to indulge his melancholy Thoughts 'Tis true he had  sufficient cause of Affliction since it was his too violent and indiscreet Passion that had proved the Cause of the loss of the Repose if not the Life of the Countess He fetch'd very deep sighs and shutting his Eyes remain'd immoveable like one struck with Death His new Friendship with Madam  Gray  received such a check by the remembrance of the high Deserts of the Countess of  Devonshire  by the high esteem he had of her Person and by that Compassion he felt within himself for her Misfortunes that he wish'd a thousand times that the Period of his Life was at hand to justifie by a solemn and sincere declaration the Innocence of the opprest Lady  Yes  said he  I will publish to the World the Extravagancies I have comitted I will expose myself to the fury of her Husband to the King's Indignation to the Violence of his Mistress and the Revenge of the Earl of  Warwick  I wou'd be hated by all the World lose all my Friends and Fortune and after all this I own myself not sufficently punish'd  He was tormenting himself in this manner heaping Reproaches upon Reproaches when he found himself interrupted by Madam  Gray  The King had told her with what trouble the Earl of  Warwick  had receiv'd the News of the loss of my Lady  Devonshire  which she embraced with an excess of Joy that she was scarce able to contain her self She took a solitary Walk the better to enjoy the pleasure of seeing herself revenged and she fancied she saw her mortal Enemy in this miserable Condition before her Eyes when espying the Earl of  Pembroke  the Instrument of her Vengeance against the Earl of  Warwick  she made up towards him with a gay Countenance  We are at last Victorious my Lord  cry'd she  You will say the Earl of  Warwick  is  likely to pay very dear for the Evils he intended against me when I tell you with what trouble and vexation of Mind he received the News of the Countess of  Devonshire's  Absence from the King and that it was suppos'd her Husband had offer'd some violence to her you may judge of my Satisfaction  The Earl of  Pembrock  opening his Eyes and hearing her Discourse with the utmost impatience  May I presume to tell you Madam  reply'd he  you are too full of Revenge alas what Crime has she committed against me How  return'd she  is it not a Crime to have been belov'd by the King And is it not another to love the Earl of  Warwick  This perfidious Man who ow'd me so many Obligations not only in regard of his constant Profession of Kindness to the House of  Lunenburgh  from which my Mother is descended but also of the many good Offices I have endeavoured to do him has contrived my Ruin You know too well what ridiculous Stories he has told of me to the King these are unpardonable Things and I profess to you that all he suffers and whatever may happen to the Countess is too little to satisfie my Revenge Well  cry'd the Earl of  Pembrock if you want another Victim to allay your Anger make use of me Madam I desire Death at your Hands as the only good that can befal me don't think me less guilty than the Earl of  Warwick  I love the Countess of  Devonshire  better than the Earl of  Warwick  and yet have condescended to be the Instrument of your Hatred both against her and my Rival what horrour don't I feel within my Breast for having been guilty of such a Crime which I committed without the least Reluctancy my Resentment caused by her indifferency towards me Jealousie which tormented me and in short the power of her Charms are the  cause of my present Misfortune If my Grief does not rob me suddenly of my Life I intend to make known all over the World how the whole Matter was concerted  Madam  Gray  hearkned to the Earl of  Pembrook  's Discourse with so much surprize that she cou'd scarce imagine what she heard to be real she was a considerable time before she cou'd speak a Word but at last broke out into most violent Reproaches and Threats He heard her patiently without being in the least moved thereat without making the least Excuse or telling her any thing to induce her to forget what he had said Quite overcome with Spite and Rage she was a going to leave him but considering with herself that if he shou'd disclose the Matter to the Earl of  Warwick  she might be brought in for her share in raising the Report about the Attempt made upon the Countess of  Devonshire  and tho' she judg'd herself so well fix'd in the King's Affection that it wou'd prove a hard task for any body to make him conceive the least Prejudice against her yet knowing what an Influence the Earl of  Warwick  had upon his Majesty she thought it the safest way not to put it to a hazard So assuming a more gentle Air she desir'd the Earl of  Pembrook  to conceal the Matter at least for some Days longer  You run no hazard in so doing  said she  and I shall be obliged to you you will have time enough to speak in behalf of your so much admired Countess  He soon found she was touch  d to the quick since notwithstanding her resentment and haughtiness she could condescend so far as to make a Request to him He to  d her  that in the Condition he now was in he was so far from being capable of concealing it that he would rather chuse to withdraw into the Country than make  her a Promise he might be apt to break and that if she wou'd get but the King's leave he wou'd go to retire from all the World at one of his Country Seats  Madam  Gray  well satisfy'd with this Expedient engaged to speak to the King about it which she did accordingly but found him not much disposed to grant it  You see  said he  unto what a melancholy state the Earl of  Warwick  is reduced the Report of my Lady  Devonshire's  Death having almost bereaved him of his Senses he is not in a Condition to attend me often and I hoped that the Earl of  Pembrook  wou'd supply his Place till his Recovery  Madam  Gray  told him  she had perceived the Earl of  Pembrook  to be out of order for several Days last past that the change of the Air would much contribute to the Recovery of his Health and consequently to his sudden return to Court  In short she being resolv'd it shou'd be so the King at last granted her Desire The young Widow was very diligent in dispatching the Earl for the Country and told him at parting she wou'd not have him come back till his Head was quite clear of his Chimeras and that she in the mean time wou'd take care of his Fortune  Act in that as you please Madam  said he coldly  I am so far from any ambitious Designs that I desire nothing but Death and I shou'd think myself much more obliged to you if you wou'd hasten it than let me linger away in the most unhappy Life upon Earth Am I the occasion of it  reply'd she with some Impatience  but I will pardon you in spite of yourself I look upon you as one that having lost his Senses is not Master of his own Affections go fetch them where you left them and return in such a Condition as may engage me to pardon what is past  The Earl of  Pembrook  took his leave without answering one  word not being able to forgive her what she had made him do against the poor Countess of  Devonshire  He was no sooner gone but Madam  Gray  began to be sensible at least more than ever she had been before that the Earl was not indifferent to her she was afraid that instead of shaking off his Spleen in the Country he might rather contract such a Habit as might endanger his Health  He is going  said she  to some place or other remote from all the World to bury himself in his Thoughts of the Countess of  Devonshire  'twill be a hard matter to get her out of his Head and so he will fall into some Distemper nay for what I know it may cost him his Life alas perhaps he may die  These Reflexions caused no small Symptoms of Pain and Grief in her being surprized to feel within herself such tender Inclinations for the Earl and she wou'd have reproach'd herself upon that Head had not the consideration of making her Fortunes over ballanc'd the rest for the Widow of a private Gentleman to be married to a Person of  high a Rank in the Kingdom  Disturbed with these Reflexions she sends for her Brother the Earl  Rivers  one of the most accomplish'd Lords at Court and in great favour with the King As he began to be considered already as one of the King's growing Favourites who had bestow'd great Favours upon him this occasioned such a jealousie in the Earl of  Warwick  that they were upon the point once of deciding their Quarrel by a Duel had they not been prevented by the King's Authority who to stop their Rage had prescribed them certain Rules which neither of them was to Transgress on pain of his Displeasure notwithstanding which there  remain'd a certain Grudge betwixt them which being carefully maintain'd by Madam  Gray  they were become irreconcilable Enemies 'Twas upon this consideration she judged she could not put the Earl of  Pembrook  into surer hands than his to make him avoid all manner of Correspondence with the Earl of  Warwick  So soon as he was come into her Chamber she told him she intended to give him an opportunity of putting an Obligation upon her  That the Earl of  Pembrook  being seized with a very deep Melancholy was a going to retire to some solitary place where instead of diminishing he wou'd encrease his Spleen that she being his Friend desired him to carry the Earl to his fine Seat call'd  Grafton  and to stay with him there for some time You will perhaps tell me  continu'd she  you can't be absent from Court without great Prejudice to yourself since in so doing you will leave the Earl of  Warwick  as it were absolute Master of the Field of Battel but rely upon my Words Brother I will talk of you so frequently to the King that upon your return out of the Country you shall find your Affairs in a better conditi than when you left them  There needed no more to engage the Earl  Rivers  to act as Madam  Gray  had desired He told her this opportunity of obliging her he look'd upon as too precious not to embrace it that he wou'd go immediately to the Earl of  Pembrook  and certainly persuade him rather to chuse  Grafton House  than any other for his Place of Retirement  Accordingly he went to him when he was just upon his Departure They being very intimate Friends and the Earl  Rivers  pretending he knew nothing of his intended Journey told him he came to take his leave of him because he  intended to go the next day to  Grafton  House Are you engaged reply'd the Earl of  Pembroke  in some Horsematch or other to be run there No said he I go only to rest my self of the fatigues of the Court If you have so much friendship as to go along with me thither I will think my self obliged to you as long as I live I am a going reply'd the Earl with a melancholy Air a great way further off I have some pressing reasons which make me fly that which would prove a great dissatisfaction to me The Earl  Rivers  appearing as if he were surprized at his Resolution urged the matter so successfully to him that he agreed to go along with him so they went out of  London  the next day  They needed not have taken so much precaution there being but little probability of the Earl of  Pembroke  's meeting with the Earl of  Warwick  for each of them had Clostred themselves up to lament the Death or at least the loss of the Countess of  Devonshire  She as I told you before was gone to Madam  Digby  's where she was entertain'd with all imaginable Civility 'Tis true under the Disguise she had taken she pass'd there but for a person of an indifferent condition but notwithstanding this her Air and Deportment gain'd her much respect from all that beheld her She had assumed the name of  Jamy  the better to conceal her Sex and Madam  Digby  had two Sons and a very handsome Niece a Woman of a great deal of sense sweet in Conversation very serious and something addicted to Melancholy Her name was  Leonore  and Madam  Digby  being resolved to make a match betwixt her and her Eldest Son who was a short ill favour'd and illtemper'd Piece used to keep  Leonore  from all Conversation for fear lest  Leonore  in case she should see others  more amiable than her Son she might take an aversion both to his Person and the intended Match  Leonore  thus spent the best of her days within the walls of her Aunts House when my Lady  Devonshire  came thither who in this Disguise appear'd so Graceful as if it had bin natural to her so that  Leonore  from the first moment she saw her was captivated to such a degree that her eyes who were not acquainted with any thing else but the sight of her ugly Cousins were now continually employ'd upon  Jamy  and she being a Woman of great Vivacity of Wit her Conversation with  Jamy  was so pleasant as by degrees inspired her with that tenderness she did neither foresee nor was able to overcome  For besides that they were both of the same Sex the Countess of  Devonshire  had such weighty reasons to have an abhorrence for Love that even the most pleasing Diversions that had the least relation to that Passion could not be acceptable to her She was quite overwhelm'd with her misfortunes under the greatest uncertainty how to manage her self for the future exasperated against the Earl of  Warwick  irreconcilable to her Spouse and the  Chevalier de Hereford  very uneasie on account of the suspicions her Family might conceive against her and the Reports that were likely to be spread abroad upon her account All these were matters of such consequence as to employ all her thoughts which would make her spend some times a whole night in one of the most solitary places of the Park belonging to the House The only thing she took some delight in to divert her Melancholy was to be instructed in the Exercise of Arms wherein she improved so well that she would match the best Man in shooting and  Madam  Digby  keeping a Fencing Master in the House to teach her two Sons  Jamy  by his Instructions in a little time became as formidable for his Arm as for his Eyes  Leonore  was surprized at the progress  Jamy  had made in this sort of Exercise and whereas before she was never known to have taken any notice of her Cousin when he was at this Exercise because he made so miserable a figure now since the arrival of  Jamy  she took so much delight in being there that young  Digby  could not but take some notice of it 'Tis true he did not know unto what to attribute this Alteration but after having seriously reflected upon the matter apply'd the reason thereof to his own advantage Flush'd with these hopes he desires  Jamy  to compose a Song or two in praise of his fair Cousin but  James  excusing himself with some carelesness  Digby  was so vex'd thereat that he got  Jamy  by the Throat  Leonore  hearing the noise came in to see what was the matter and without hesitating upon the point pulls her Cousin by the Hair till he was glad to let  Jamy  alone Ingrateful Woman cry'd the little Cousin did you know the occasion of our Quarrel you would be as much vex'd at it as I am I desir'd him to compose me some Verses I intended to present you with but he told me with a scornful look he could not make Verses at command unless it were for himself  Leonore  casting a scornful look upon her Counsin went away without saying one word to the Park in that solitary place to bewail her misfortune  Certain it is that since the arrival of  Jamy  she had had but little Repose At the first beginning she imbraced this growing tenderness only as a means to counterpoise her aversion to that Monster they had design'd her for a Husband  but it was not long before she was convinced to her cost that Love is no less pernicious than hatred she then began to open her eyes and duly reflecting upon her present Circumstances found Love so dreadful a Guest as made her sigh and condole her self without intermission  She was no sooner got to the further end of a thick and dark Wood but seating her self near a little Brook she ruminated a considerable time upon her present condition at last What dost thou mean unfortunate  Leonore  said she to her self is it possible thou should'st be so far an Enemy to thy self as to have a particular regard to a young man so much below thee what is it thou proposest since he can't be thy Husband But why continued she I have Riches enough and not Ambition there is no place upon Earth where I could not live happily with him and no doubt but he will think it the greatest good fortune that could befall him to marry me She framed a thousand other pleasing Projects which vanishing as soon as they came and she thus remaining in suspence betwixt hope and fear served only to augment her affliction when she heard on a sudden a noise near her For fear of being over heard by her Aunt or young  Digby  she arose immediately and casting her Eyes on all sides found it was  Jamy  who was going at a further distance as soon as he saw her  She thought it was out of Respect but being no more Mistress of her own heart she call'd and made a sign to him to draw nearer  'Tis but reasonable  said she smilingly  I should chide you for having refused to oblige my Cousin with a few Verses intended for me I should have made but a very ill piece of work of it  reply'd he  my thoughts are too much taken up to be employ'd in a  thing of this nature Say rather  added she  you are so deeply engaged in a secret passion as not to permit you to think of any other Object but what you love  He did not return an Answer immediately and the impatient  Leonore  continued her Discourse  Your silence  said she  is easie to be understood Oh  Jamy  you are in Love I suppose it is with the same person for which you fought a Duel in  London  'tis she that has given us the opportunity of seeing you here what a Fatality is this Jamy  having recovered himself told her  Were you acquainted with the reasons I have of complaining of my misfortunes you would not believe me to be capable of a Passion to which I was always a stranger The very name of  Love  is terrible to me How is it possible  reply'd she  you should hate to so excessive a degree what you don't know 'tis certain you have bin in Love but are dissatisfied But supposing you have proved unfortunate at one time that ought not to check you for ever I have something of skill in Physiognomy and Astronomy I foresee every thing will prove successful to you  Love and you shall be beloved  Jamy  much surprized at what he heard  Fair  Leonore said he  I am not capable of following your counsel I must employ all my thoughts upon my present condition which is deplorable and my temper is such that I can't submit to it I must either die or see my Destiny changed I find  said she  you still resent the ill Treatment you received of my Cousin but you must excuse him considering he has sufficient reason to be jealous of you Of me  reply'd  Jamy alas for what reason He has observed  continued she not without some confusion  that I always look at you with pleasure that I can't forbear to speak in your praise and he perceives perhaps that my  thoughts in respect to you even exceed my words  Alas  Jamy  and have not you perceived that as well as he I understand a Jest  answered he  you intend to make your self merry at my cost but provided it be the least satisfaction to you I am very willing to take it however don't think my complaisance is unlimited for it is no less true that were it possible to suppose you could stoop so low as to intend to marry me my present condition is such that I should not enjoy the fruits of your Goodness How  cry'd  Leonore  with much impatience  and would you not marry me Would you refuse to marry your Fortune I should but ill repay to Madam  Digby  the Civilities I receive in her House  reply  d hee  But you wou'd he at least revenged of her Sex  said she  But that way is not suitable to my present Station  continued he  I am resolved first to resettle my mind before I entertain any thoughts of Marriage But I will make you for ever  said she  I have a great Fortune at my Command and am willing to share it with you Your Relations will be very angry at it  reply'd he  I won't see the face of any of them  return'd she  We will go and live in the most Delight some Place of all  Europe  we will set up a kind of a Hermitage in some delicious Valley where the clearest Springs slide gently along among the Trees we will have Books we will have Musical Instruments good Gardens few Domesticks and plain but clean and near Furniture thus remote from the noise of the World our best days will pass away like a Dream All what you tell me is no more than such  answered  Jamy  with a smile  and I little thought that so amiable a young Lady as you had the Gift of building Castles in the air Oh cease cruel man  return'd she  to turn into ridicule a tender Passion  you ought to embrace with respect you are too sensible of the Sentiments and Frailties of my tender Heart tho' I have this to say for myself that I have omitted nothing that might conduce to check my Passion that all this has served only to encrease my Sufferings and your Idea which is never absent from my Mind has always got the upper hand over my most firm and most serious Resolutions I am not sensible of what I have done  said he  whatever it was it was against my Will I must tell you once more  Leonora  you and I were not made for one another  This poor young Lady quite overwhelm'd with Grief and Shame fell upon the Ground without Sense or Motion which as it caused no less the trouble than pity of  Jamy  he did all he cou'd to bring her to herself again Alas said he  What unfortunate Planet was I born under see love will not cease to persecute me I hoped to have sheltered myself against its Force in this Solitude and Fate will have it so that this charming young Lady shou'd have too tender Sentiments for me and that I shou'd innocently be accessary to her Misfortuues  The Water which  Jamy  threw into  Leonore's  Face being taken out of a very cool Spring she soon recover'd her Senses Her Eyes which were scarce half open discovered the tenderness and Languishment of her Heart she had leant her Head upon  Jamy  's Knees they were both very pensive and mutually bemoaning their Fate when alarm'd by the sound of the Huntinghorns and noise of the Dogs they saw a Stag pursu'd by the Hunters thro' an opening of the Park running directly to them where he was soon after run down by the Dogs The Hounds belonged to the Earl  Rivers  who had a Seat not above  a few Miles from Madam  Digby's  but they kept no correspondence together there being a great difference betwixt their Ages and way of living  The Earl was not a little surprized to see so fair a Lady as  Leonore  was in this retired place alone with one of the hand somest and best shap'd Men in the World and leaning her head upon him  Leonore  got up as fast as she could but the Earl  Rivers  who observed every Motion of hers follow'd and accosted her with an Air which discover'd a certain mixture of Fear and Confidence  I have given you some disturbance Madam  said he to her  and that perhaps at the very nick of time when you were going to take a Sleep pray bear me no ill will upon that account for you are reveng'd already and if I have robb'd you of your Rest for a few moments I fear I have lost mine for ever Leonore  knew the Earl no more than he did her but judged him to be a Person of Quality and upon that score wou'd have receiv'd his Addresses without much Reluctancy had not  Jamy  got already the sole Ascendant over her Heart So looking upon him said coldly  If you complain no more of me than I do of you  my Lord  you will have no great occasion to repent of our meeting here but not to obstruct your freedom I am going to leave you  She made the best of her way towards their House which was not far off but the Earl endeavouring to stop her a little  An Impression made by such a one as you  said he to her  is not easily to be razed out Alas I ought not to have look'd at you but now it is too late the Venom is taken and your Absence will augment its Strength Leonore  scarce minded what he said but went home and the Earl fearing lest he shou'd disoblige her in following her any farther came back to his Company but in  so ill a Humour as is scarce to be imagined He went to the Place where he left  Jamy  with an  tention to ask him who  Leonore  was and to  form himself if possibly he cou'd concerning  is own Condition but he lost his Labour for  Jamy  was very uneasie at the sight of him and  ho' it seem'd not very probable that the Coun  ess of  Devonshire  shou'd be discover'd under such a Disguise nevertheless she thought it her safest way not to run the risque of it The Earl  Rivers  looking about him on all sides in hopes to see one or other that might tell him what he wanted to know at last espy'd young  Digby  He made up to him as fast as he cou'd and ask'd him who the young Lady was  Her Name is Leonore  said he to the Earl  she is my Cousin and will be my Wife before we are a Month older  The Earl  Rivers  was so far from looking upon him as a formidable Rival that he pity'd the poor Lady who was to be marry'd to so illfavour'd a Man  So home he went where finding the Earl of  Pembrook  in his melancholy posture he blam'd him for his not going along with him a Hunting and then told him what had happen'd in relation especially to  Leonore Jamy  and  Digby  The Earl of  Pembrook  told him he knew the Mother of young  Digby  that he lodged there one time when the King was at  GraftonHouse  that her Niece might perhaps then not live with her or that they kept her out of his sight  'Prudence requires  said the Earl  Rivers to keep her out of the sight of so accomplish'd a Person as you are and after all I saw a young Gentleman with her whom I look upon as a dangerous Companion and if Madam  Digby  intends to keep her Nieces Heart entire for her Son she had better be without such Guests  Perhaps  continu'd the Earl of  Pembrook it was one of her Sons I can't tell that  reply'd the Earl  but am sure she look'd not with an indifferent eye at him her Head rested upon his Knees and she had not power to turn her eyes any other way but upon him Oh what wou'd I not give to know the bottom of this whole Intrigue And what good wou'd it do you my Lord  said the Earl of  Pembrook  coldly  Rather say  cry'd the Earl of  Rivers what good wou'd it not do me Is it possible we shou'd talk a whole hour upon this Subject and you not perceive all this while how far my Interest is concern'd in it'  My Lord  Pembrook  thought it not worth his while to return an Answer being quite buried in his own melancholy Thoughts  The Earl  Rivers  liv'd in hopes that if he could forbear seeing  Leonore  for some few Days her Idea wou'd wear out by degrees but whenever he went abroad he cou'd not forbear going within sight of her House tho' he had no opportunity or pretence of going in The Earl of  Pembrook  not shewing himself so complaisant to the reiterated requests of his Friend as to go along with him thither  Am not I sufficiently plagued with my own Passion  said he  must I be also tormented with yours Let me go to  London  or don't you Love at  Grafton The E could not forbear smiling at my Lord's abrupt Expressions but the Idea of  Leonore  had made too deep an Impression upon his Mind to be able to shake it off at so easie a rate  This fair Lady in the mean time most narrowly watch'd every step  Jamy  had made and as this served only to convince her of his Indifferency so it furnish'd her every day with fresh Matter of Grief and Vexation  What a shame is  it  said she  to be in love with a Man so inferiour in Birth to me nay to see my self slighted by him after having declared my Passion to him  All these dismal reflections enough to humble the most couragious person in the World at last threw her into a most excessive melancholy Young  Digby  tho' very dull of apprehension did not fail to observe it and prompted by his Jealousy resolved to make  Jamy  pay for his Mistress's ill humour 'twas upon that account he would seek frequent quarrels with him but wanting courage to encounter him himself he look'd out for a good and trusty hand that might dispatch him After having well weigh'd the matter for some time he pitch'd upon his Fencing Master as the most proper person to second his sinister intentions against  Jamy  But he happened to be mistaken in his choice the Fencing Master was an honest man and one who had as much kindness for  Jamy  as if he had been his Son He did indeed pretend to accept of the Proposition but it was because it should not be done by another hand and so he discovered the whole Plot to  Jamy  Alas cry'd he full of Grief what matters it my Life is not worthy taking care of tho' I must confess I should be very sorry to find you my Enemy Let  Digby  but entrust another with this Murther and he shall find I will not oppose him This is the strangest piece of Indifferency that ever I heard of reply'd the Fencing Master 'tis impossible for me to see it I beg you therefore by all that is good to think of leaving this House for fear any misfortune should befall you here  Jamy  return'd thanks for his kindness and care for him but nevertheless shew'd so much indisterency in regard to his own person that the Fencing Master saw himself under a necessity of speaking to  Leonore  about it  having observed for some time past that she shew'd a particular esteem for him and that probably it was upon that account young  Digby  had framed his design against  Jamy  's Life He gave her a full account of the matter whereat she was alarm'd to the highest degree and tho' she had put the utmost violences upon her self to avoid him and shew him all possible marks of indifferency this news was sufficient to engage her to confer with him upon that Subject  She chose for this purpose the same Wood where she had discovered her Passion and address'd her self to him with an air that shew'd at least as much confusion and grief as in her first Discovery  'Your Deportment towards me for some time past said she might easily dispense me from concerning my self for your Interest could I dispense with my self But the same Fatality that has made me sensible of your Deserts will not allow me to be acquainted with the danger you are in without trembling at the very thoughts thereof Yes  Jamy  your Life is dear to me in spite of all your Ingratitude therefore take heed secure y  our self against the Attempts of the Pe  fidious  Digby  This Monster thinks it not sufficient to importune me with his nauseous Passion but also intends to make you a Sacrifice if possible to his Jealousy which prompts him to imagin that you have a real Passion for me I don't merit that obliging care you take for me fair  Leonore  reply'd  Jamy  you must consider me as an unfortunate Person who is not in a condition to return your Obligations and therefore you ought to see me perish without afflicting your self And why to see you perish  Jamy  said  she Is it impossible for you to embrace the Offer I made you Fly from this House but permit me to be a sharer in your Flight Are not your Enemies mine also Let us therefore retire to some Country or other such as you like best I shall be always contented as long as I am with you'  Jamy  seeing himself thus put to it beyond whatever he had been before told her with a deep sigh  'You don't know me well enough fair  Leonore  to declare your self thus favourably in my behalf said he I am engaged by such strict tyes that nothing in the world can break them How then are you marry'd cry'd she then I have nothing to hope for why would not you let me know the Secret you disclose now some time ago perhaps the consideration of the impossibility of attaining to what I desired might have proved a good Remedy to accelerate my Cure'  Then loading him with a thousand Reproaches took from that instant a Resolution of procuring her own death a thing not very uncommon among the  English▪  However she did not think fit to kill her self with her own hands for fear the cause of so desperate a resolution might be enquired into and discovered to the World but she took a Dose of a lingring Poyson the first effects whereof tho' they reduced her to a languishing state yet made no considerable diminution in her Charms  All this while the Countess of  Devonshire  expected with much impatience some alteration in her affairs being weary of living thus in disguise at Madam  Digby  's under the Name of  Jamy  Her Nurse gave her from time to time an account of what pass'd in relation to her self what noise her absence made at  London  and what pains the Earl of  Devonshire  took to find her  out For tho' he did come no more to Court he had so vast an acquaintance that he knew every thing that pass'd and not only this he had sent Spies also into all the Counties of the Kingdom to find her out so that she had all the reason in the world to be upon her Guard This reason alone was sufficient to make her continue in a place where  Leonore  's Love and Mr  Digby  's hatred were equally troublesome to her tho' to speak the truth there was another Cause besides this of her present affliction  viz  the remembrance of the Earl of  Warwick  whene'er she took a walk in the shady Wood she fancied she saw and heard him in his whole shape mien nay even the sound of his Voice his engaging Air and that Grandeur wherein he surpassed all others All these imaginations served only to raise new impressions which were supported and nourished by the Solitude of the Place She would spend whole days in some of the darkest Walks to reproach him with his Ingratitude just as if he had bin near enough to hear her a convincing proof to her self that she retained so strong an inclination for him as she was not able to Master which served only to add to her Torments and to turn her Anger at last against her self  The Earl  Rivers  's condition was no less unfortunate for the obstacles he met with of seeing  Leonore  rendring her more precious in his Eyes he was talking day and night of her to the Earl of  Pembroke  who instead of giving him the least answer to that point extoll'd the Merits and Innocence of the Countess of  Devonshire  and as nothing could be more disagreeable to him he did all he could to divert him from that Discourse and when his Passion would not suffer him any longer to pursue that  method he kept a long and profound silence to the no small vexation of the Earl of  Pembroke  I should be glad to know said he with some impatience what your Design was in bringing me hither Did you imagine I came to this place to be your Confident in your fantastical Intrigues when at the same time you will not give me leave to make my Complaints in hopes of meeting with some Comfort in my Friend Truly answered the Earl  Rivers  mine is no  Chimera Leonore  is no Spectre to frighten one and considering every thing I have more reason on my side than you have for my Lady  Devonshire  loves no Body or if she does 'tis certain it is the Earl of  Warwick  such a Rival as he is not so soon to be thrown out of the Saddle you lose both your time and your labour and is not this next door to a madness In this manner they used often times to pass away the time together but at last the Earl  Rivers  knowing that he should stand in need of the Earl of  Pembroke  's assistance began to condole his Passion and at the same time forgot not to conjure him to carry him to Madam  Digby  's that he might speak to  Leonore  and inform himself concerning  Jamy  whom he look'd upon as a dangerous Rival  His Importunities and Complaisance at last engaged the Earl of  Pembroke  to conduct him to Madam  Digby  's in hopes to meet with an opportunity of entertaining  Leonore  in private The Earl  Rivers  desirous to know how matters stood with his Mistress before he went thither himself appointed a place at a small distance thence in a Wood where to wait for his return At parting he told him Am not I a patient Lover the Repose of my Life depends on the success of your Conversation If I meet with a repulse  I am lost for ever  'This is a violent Passion indeed answered the Earl of  Pembroke  considering how little hopes you have Why will you talk at that rate said the Earl of  Rivers  Are not you sufficiently convinced by your own experience that one may love without hopes and may not I flatter my self with more hopes than you in regard to my Lady  Devonshire  she treats you with the utmost rigour she is a marry'd Lady and you know she prefers the Earl of  Warwick  to you'  He was so far touch'd to the quick by what he heard his Friend say that he had almost taken a resolution of not stirring any further for that time I think said he you make it your sport to seek my destruction What have I done you should revive in my head these melancholy Considerations He was running on thus till the Earl  Rivers  put a stop to his Complaints by entreating him without intermission to go to Madam  Digby  's He was no sooner entred the House but found the old Lady in the greatest confusion imaginable by reason of the miserable state  Leonore  was reduced to for the Poyson she had taken answered its operation so effectually that her Life was despaired of Seeing the whole House in tears he ask'd Madam  Digby  the cause of it she told him she believed her Niece would not live two hours longer because she would not take the least thing to forward the Cure of her Disease and that none of the ablest Physicians could guess at the true cause of it  The Earl of  Pembroke  touch'd with compassion for the young Lady ask'd leave to be admitted into her Chamber whither being conducted by Madam  Digby  he found  Leonore  sitting in an Elbow Chair with a slight loose NightGown about her only tho' the Weather was not then  very warm but she had a fire burning within her which none but  Jamy  could extinguish and therefore would suffer no body to hold up her head but him Her Eyes were constantly fix'd upon him and the want of their usual lustre and her pale Countenance sufficiently discovered the anguish of her Soul I am at the point of Death would she cry frequently and will you let me die These being the only words she was heard to say for a good while Poor  Jamy  reduced almost to Despair to see this young Lady in so miserable a Condition did nothing but sigh and his sighs being in outward appearance offensive to her she wou'd look at him with some Marks of Anger and continu'd saying  I am a dying will you let me die  The Earl finding this young Lady under such a deadly Languishment and seeming to ask the Preservation of her Life made her a Compliment which was answered by her only by a Nod but continu'd in the same tone  Will you let me die  with so melancholy an Air and Voice as drew Tears from all that beheld her  At last the Earl of  Pembrook  casting his eyes upon  Jamy  discerned so great a resemblance betwixt him and the Countess of  Devonshire  that it is impossible to describe the Confusion it caused in his Mind She knew him as soon as he enter'd the Room which as it occasion'd no small disturbance in her so the various Alterations in her Face were undeniable Symptoms of her Uneasiness and she wou'd not have staid long in the Chamber had not  Leonore  who wou'd not be without  Jamy  kept her So being oblig'd to see herself expos'd to the Curiosity of the Earl of  Pembrook  he told her  You are very constant in attending this poor dying Lady My Lord  answer'd  Jamy  with a low voice for fear of being discover'd by the sound thereof  I am willing to do her all the petty Services I can Perhaps  added the Earl  you are one of her Relations I have not the honour of being so  reply'd he  And what brought you hither  continu'd my Lord  a young Gentleman so well accomplish'd as you might fix in a more advantageous place for his Fortune than to spend his time in the Country  Instead of answering his Question  Jamy  told him  My Lord our Patient is disturbed at our Discourse so near her  The Earl hereupon seated himself in a Chair where he might more narrowly observe and take a view of  Jamy  and the more he look'd at him the more he discover'd of the Air and Deportment of the Countess of  Devonshire Is she then really escaped her Husband's Fury  said he to himself  and is it in this Place she has sought for shelter under this Disguise  Whilst he was sitting very pensive for some time the Countess of  Devonshire  who observed all his Motions began to be convinc'd that if he was not already very certain of it it wou'd not be long before he wou'd discover her Disguise Never was any poor Lady brought to such an extremity not knowing what Course to take for her Safety However she took the first opportunity of getting out of the Room but being as yet unresolved what to do went into the Wood there to reflect upon the present Necessity she was reduced to of leaving the Place  O matchless Frailty  cry'd she  will my hard Fortune never cease to Persecute me Which way I turn myself I meet those that will persecute me some out of an implacable Hatred conspire against my Life Others hurried on by Passion I can't submit to add to my Torments let us therefore fly let us retire to some Desart or other where I may spend the remnants of my miserable Days in quietness  She was upon the point of putting in execution her Resolution when she was met by the Earl of  Pembroke  just as she was going out of the Park He having taken particular notice of  Jamy  when he went out of the Room and this proving an additional reason to augment his former Suspicions sought only an opportunity to follow him  Leonore  soon after perceiving he was gone and asking with much earnestness where he was my Lord pretending to be concern'd for the Sick Lady went to look after him and found him coming out of the Park Leonore  wants you  said he to  Jamy but I can't also be without you I must have one Moments Conversation with you My Lord  reply'd she  I want Sense to entertain you besides you are sensible in the Condition this poor sick Lady is in I can't stay long from her  She had scarce said these Words but she was a going away as fast as she cou'd All these things serving only to confirm the Earl in his former Opinion and unwilling to lose so precious an Opportunity this made him transgress the Rules of Decency for he run after  Jamy  and not without some Violence stop'd him  No no  said he  I shall not suffer you to leave me thus  and then taking him by the hand pull'd him against his Will into the Wood  It was here the Earl once more look'd stedfastly at him for some time and then breaking silence  Are not you sensible  said he  I am convinced of what you wou'd make a Mystery to me Most adoreable Countess don't refuse to make me your Confident How many Tears have I sacrificed to your Death I perfectly know you 'tis impossible such a thing as this shou'd escape my penetration let me stand indebted to you for a Secret I am Master of already The Respect I bear you My Lord  answered  Jamy  modestly  makes me  imagine that you have a mind to divert yourself with me rather than that you shou'd really mistake my Person but will you give me leave to ask you upon what ground it is you give me the Title of a Countess Oh cruel Woman  teply'd he  do you think it possible I shou'd be mistaken How shou'd that very Heart which adores you not know you Should the same Eyes that have shed so many Tears sor you mistake when they see you and is not your Cruelty alone sufficient to convince me that you are still the same I can't tell my Lord  said  Jamy  with an angry Air  whom you take me for but I think you had better not detain me when you know  Leonore  wants me Whom I take you for Madam  continu'd the Earl  Oh I take you for the most cruel Person in the Universe nobody has admittance to you but the Earl of  Warwick  this happy Mortal maintains his ground in your Heart in spite of all your Adorers and you delight in treating me thus cruelly on purpose to oblige him How your Eyes sparkle with Disdain and Anger Alas why will you make the most respectful the most tender and most Unfortunate of all Lovers the Object of your Hatred  The Countess seeing him so sensibly afflicted cou'd not forbear to feel some share in his Pain she stood with her Arms across and her Eyes fixt on the ground immoveable not knowing what Resolution to take whether to discover or continue to conceal her Name The Earl who was not insensible of what pass'd in her Heart wou'd willingly at her Feet have conjured her to put an entire Confidence in him but that he fear'd to be overseen by somebody or another but he forgot not to represent to her in the most lively Expressions that cou'd be invented the signal Obligation he shou'd owe her if she wou'd make him a sharer in the Secret After various  Reflexions she resolved not to comply with his Request and told him  'she thought it very hard to be thus persecuted by a Person she had nothing to do withal and so away she went'  so overwhelm'd with Grief that she scarce knew what she did or whither she was going The Earl was no less troubl'd than herself not knowing what he had best to do He follow'd her at a good distance with his Eyes but his Respect to her Person wou'd not permit him to go after her After a few moments stay his impatience of seeing her again made him hasten out of the Wood to  Leonore's  Chamber but was much surprized not to meet with her there  Leonore  ask'd very earnestly after  Jamy  'I am at the point of Death  said she  I want to talk with him about a Matter of the utmost Consequence both to me and him'  Search being made after him in every Corner at last word was brought that he had been met on Horseback riding as fast as he cou'd from the House At this unexpected News  Leonere  and the Earl being equally afflicted the first fetch'd a deep Sigh and desired the Earl to draw nearer  'You will doubtless be surprized my Lord  said she to him  that not having the honour to know you I shou'd chuse you rather than any one of my own Family the Executor of my last Will and Testament but it being my desire to have it executed accordingly without any regard to young  Digby  or his Mother I promise myself from your Generosity that you will see  Jamy  put into the quiet Possession of what I now bequeath to him which is of my whole Estate and every thing I am Mistress of in the World I don't question but he will wonder at this Action and perhaps I am in the wrong thus to reward his Ingratitude but  my Heart is as full of Tenderness towards him as his is full of Aversion to me To be short my Lord we are not at all times Masters of the Sentiments of our Hearts 'twas that made me desire the same share in his as he had in mine and notwithstanding the inequality that is betwixt us offer'd to marry him if he thought fit but his indifferency soon decided the Matter against my Request 'Tis therefore time to die this is the only Satisfaction I can have without him'  At these Words the Tears trickl'd down her Cheeks and the Earl who was not a little dispos'd to melancholy bore so considerable a share in her Affliction that she soon perceiv'd it and returning hearty Thanks told him  'I shou'd die with some Satisfaction cou'd I have seen in  Jamy  something resembling the same Sentiments you are pleas'd to express No body but himself would have denied me so reasonable a Satisfaction but were you acquainted with his Heart you wou'd be surprized at his Cruelty'  'Alas Madam  said the Earl to her  I know it too well If he has proved the Cause of your Misfortunes he has no less been the occasion of mine What do you say my Lord  reply'd Leonore  Do you take me right I spoke of  Jamy  that young Gentleman you saw in this Chamber Yes  Leonore answer'd he  I understand you very well and that you may be sensible I did know that the Person unto whom you have made your addresses under the Name of  Jamy  is a Lady whom you might still see here at this moment had it not been for my coming hither 'twas my fatal Presence she could not endure 'tis that made her fly we shall see her no more However keep my Secret as Religiously as I will keep yours'  Leonore  full of Amazement  and Confusion at what was told her was not able to utter one Word she could scarce believe what the Earl said tho' at the same time she wish'd it might be true for she began to be sensible that the Repose of her Life depended thereon which made her ask him a thousand Questions At last she ingaged him by repeated Oaths to confirm the Truth to her which made her recal to mind several things she had seen  Jamy  do which were much more usual among Women than Men and which might easily have created a suspicion in her had she not been blinded by Passion  After having well weigh'd the present Circumstances of her Life Death began to appear to her in its most terrible shape she had flatter'd her self that her Generosity to  Jamy  express'd in her last Will and Testament and the Declaration she intended to make him of having taken some Poyson would produce more tender effects than all her Discourses had been able to do and move his heart to Love or at least to Compassion but this Design being rendred abortive by his Absence and by what she had heard from the Earl she told him after some moments silence  The Confession I have made to you is so very disagreeable to a Woman of my temper that whatever you will hear me say further will be overcome by me without much difficulty I tell you this my Lord  said she  in reference to the condition you now see me in what I have done was the effect of my Despair I have poysoned my self  The Earl stood amazed at the strangeness of the thing  Is it possible  Leonore cry'd he  that you had courage enough to make an attempt upon your own life Oh 'tis time to assist you 'tis time to get proper Remedies to save you I should not be against it  reply'd she  if it could be done without  the knowledge of my Friends who else will certainly reproach me with it and my Aunt will force me to marry her Son 'Twas in some measure the Aversion I had to that match which made me fix my Love upon  Jamy The Earl perceiving  Leonore  willing enough to live provided her Vanity might be thus far satisfy'd as to keep her design of making her self away by Poyson from her Friends told her he would himself bring her proper Antidotes and if his affairs should call him to  London  the Earl  Rivers  was to do it in his stead that he being his intimate Friend he could promise in his behalf that he would concern himself in so particular a manner in her welfare that she might without the least fear put an intire confidence in him  He left her with this assurance making all the haste he could to the Wood to acquaint his Friend with what had happened who in the mean while had pass'd his time under a thousand Inquietudes thinking that his Friend had forgot him but 'tis impossible to express his Affliction when he heard the Earl of  Pembroke  particularize to him what had pass'd at Madam  Digby  's House in reference to  Leonore  'Twas not alone the danger he understood she was in that troubled his mind but also the dread of a beautiful Rival but when he was told she had taken Poyson he remain'd like one that was Thunderstruck So soon as he had recovered himself a little he was for taking Post immediately for  London  to provide such Remedies as should be judged proper under her present Circumstances But the Earl of  Pembroke  disliking his Resolution  'If you go to  London  said he and come back without paying your Respect to the King and Madam  Gray  they will perhaps take it amiss and if you do it will take you  up more time than can be allow'd of Take my advice stay you at  Grafton  and let me go let me follow my cruel Destiny Alas was there ever such thing as this I met my Lady  Devonshire  by the oddest Chance in the world Love seem'd as if she intended to bestow some of her favours upon me but when I thought I might flatter my self with hopes she proves as cruel to me as ever Why then should you make any further Attempt'  said the Earl  Rivers  to him  'Reason and Despair ought to have bin my Physicians reply'd he but hitherto they have not bin able to compass the Cure'  They were thus discoursing till they came to the House where whilst the Horses were getting ready the Earl of  Pembroke  took a little nourishment and the Earl  Rivers  took this opportunity of asking him a thousand Questions concerning  Leonore  'Do you think said he she will quit her Passion for  Jamy  perhaps since she resolved to poyson her self she may also be still inclined to die for him No matters stand with her otherwise now than they did before reply'd my Lord  Pembroke  I have made her sensible of her error Death begins to appear frightful to her and you must endeavour to perswade her that the best way to forget  Jamy  is to put you in his Place'  ''Tis true reply'd the Earl that if I could convince her of that Point I might flatter my self with some hopes of success but perhaps her opinion and mine are very different Alas added he 'tis time enought to think of means to oblige her my Lord let's endeavour first her Preservation I conjure you to send me a powerful Antidote and pray Heavens grant it may prove effectual'  They embraced at parting and the E of  Pembroke  was all the while he was upon the Road to  London  ruminating upon what measures he was to take whether to go in search of the Countess and to do her all the service that possibly he could or whether he had better not to look after her for fear of incurring her Displeasure nay he wish'd it might be concealed from all the world that she was still alive His first motive had a peculiar relation to the Countess's Repose fearing lest the Earl of  Devonshire  might deal very roughly with her nor was his mind less disturbed with the Earl of  Warwick  's Passion The condition he had seen that Lord reduced to upon the News of the Death of the Countess of  Devonshire  was a convincing proof to him that he loved her still so he fear'd that in case he should find her out his Passion and Constancy might make a favourable Impression upon her  'How difficult it is said he to be always Rival to a man who is beloved and deserves to be beloved But if I may hope for a favourable Change of my Destiny I must find out the Countess and perswade her to shelter her self in some agreeable Solitude without making any body a Partner in the Secret but my self and I would not fail to assist her to the utmost in her concealment'  All his thoughts were taken up with such like Notions for several days however this made him not neglect to send proper Medicines to  Leonore  which produced this happy effect that she soon recovered of her Distemper This done he employ'd all his diligence in finding out the Countess with all imaginable secrecy and meeting with the Larl of  Warwick  was very cautious in mentioning the least thing to him of what had happened at Madam  Digby  's and the extream  affliction he observed in the Earl at the loss of my Lady  Devonshire  was so far from moving him to compassion that he told him she was certainly dead as often as he saw him  purpose to encrease the vexation of his Rival At last the Court becoming insupportable to the Earl of  Warwick  he desired leave of the King to retire for some time to  Sionhill  a Seat of his about or Miles from  London  in the way to  Windsor  seated upon the Bank of the River  Thames  The Earl of  Pembroke  's return to  London  whom Madam  Gray  esteem'd as much as she hated the E of  Warwick  facilitated his Request for she looking upon it as a Piece of Policy to remove her Enemy at a further distance soon impetrated the King's Leave for his Departure wherewith the Earl was exceedingly satisfy'd seeing himself now at full liberty to abandon himself entirely to the highest degree of Grief that ever any mortal man was capable of He left his Family at  London  taking along with him only  Berincour  and some few others to attend him Thus left to his thoughts he had this sad comfort to condole himself without being overheard and to recall to his mind all the Circumstances of an Amorous Engagement he pursued without the least hopes of Success  In this Extremity he resolves to go to  France  intending to stay some time at  Calais  whereof he was Governour for tho' one  Vauelain  a Gentleman of  Gascony  in whom he put more than ordinary confidence was his DeputyGovernour there that Post was of such vast consequence and so honourable that nothing less than a Passion like his for the Countess of  Devonshire  could retain a Man in  England  'To what a condition am I reduced to said he to  Berincour  I am for leaving the Court  Chelsey  and  Sionhill  I am for leaving the Kingdom because every thing revives in my heart the Remembrance of the Countess But my Lord reply'd the Gentleman do you imagin that this so dear a Remembrance will not follow you where ever you go have you forgot those melancholy days at  Caerleon  There is a vast difference cry'd he betwixt that time and this I had reason to believe that the Countess did not hate me and I knew she was safe in her own Family but the Case is quite different now she has writ a slighting Letter to me and has suffered her self to be carry'd away by another Good God what a Contrivance was this for a Person of her Merits What had I committed against her and why would not she rather bestow this Favour upon me than another Lover Does she think 'tis possible he should love her more violently than I did and notwithstanding this she thought she could not offer a more pleasing Sacrifice to him than to break off with me But added he All these things are now remembred to no purpose since I can't any ways doubt of her Death This cruel Husband of hers has Sacrificed her to his Jealousy and I am too fully revenged All my thoughts of her shall for the future be employed in believing her not so much in the wrong in respect to my self as I did imagin I will think her faithful to regret her loss for all the Remainder of my Life'  The Earl would often talk to  Berincour  after this manner and when he did not it was to indulge himself with less Interruption in his Remembrance of my Lady  Devonshire  this being the only thing he thought a fit object of his care for he was grown so regardless of his fortune that every thing that Madam  Gray  could  do to supplant him was indifferent to him On the other hand the Earls of  Pembroke  and  Rivers  had the best opportunity in the World of improving his Absence to their advantage had they been in a condition to do it But the first seeing himself more intangled in Love than ever thought of nothing else but how to find out my Lady  Devonshire  without making the least noise for fear it might otherwise be attended with ill Consequences As for the other he dream'd of nothing but  Leonore  The Antidote was taken without Repugnancy This young Lady having changed her mind was not for dying since she knew that  Jamy  was a Woman she was asham'd of her frailty and all her thoughts were now taken up in checking a Passion which had but too much tormented her You may imagin that the Earl  Rivers  neglected nothing to dispose her in his favour and lest his Assiduity should afford Cause of suspicion to Madam  Digby  he insinuated to her with much dexterity that he could not intrust any body but himself with the true method and management of this Remedy that therefore he should be obliged to serve its Operation every day and that for a considerable time All the Family shew'd abundance of Respect and Gratitude to him in consideration of the Pains he took to preserve  Leonore  's Life as well as all her Acquaintance so that there needed not much trouble for him to get a free Access  In the mean time  Jamy  's  ight made no small noise amongst them One of  Leonore  's Attendants had over heard several things that were spoken betwixt her and the Earl of  Pembroke  and this join'd to some other Circumstances she had taken notice of made her believe that  Jamy  was no Man but came there is Disguise She  could not conceal her thoughts from some of her Friends and these tatling it to others the thing was not only divulged by degrees but also encreased by certain additional Circumstances The Earl of  Devonshire  who had his Spies in every Place was soon inform'd of what had happened at Madam  Digby  's and the news thereof soon reaching the King's Ear tho related under different Circumstances he and Madam  Gray  ask'd the Earl of  Pembroke  a thousand Questions about it which put him to no small Confusion fearing lest the Countess of  Devonshire  should suspect him of having betray'd her Secret  Yes  cry'd he  'tis my misfortune she will infallibly impute the Discovery of this whole Adventure to my Indiscretion I say to me who is the most faithful of all her friends and who would rather die than to make her uneasie upon any account whatever notwithstanding all this I am certain she will entertain quite another Opinion of me  The Marquess of  Montague  who was one of the most honourable and most amiable Persons in  England  had so tender a Friendship for the Earl of  Warwick  his Brother that he never let slip the least opportunity of obliging him He no sooner heard what was rumour'd abroad concerning the Countess of  Devonshire  but to  Sionhill  he went to tell him that it was believed she was still living knowing that he could not put any greater Obligation upon him than this Coming thither he was told by  Berincour  that the Earl would see no body that he was come thither from  London  to avoid all manner of Conversation that in case he should give him admittance before the rest of his Friends they would be apt to take exception at it and that therefore he desired him to acquiesce in what he had told him  My Brother knows me  answered the Marquess  to be the best of his Friends and I should have reason to be much dissatisfy'd if he should use me not as such upon this Occasion However tell him that if he will not admit of a Visit of the Marquess's of  Montague  he may receive me as a Messenger who brings him some News concerning the Countess of  Devonshire  At these words  Berincour  went to his Master's Apartment unto whom he told what he had heard the Marquess say touching the Countess of  Devonshire  The very name of the Countess being alone sufficient to charm the Earl he run out straightways to meet his Brother and embracing him tenderly conjured him that if he had any News of the Countess to let him know it immediately  But my dear Brother  added he  don't flatter me let not your Desire of allaying my Pain ingage you to feed me up with false hopes I am not so far assured of what I am to tell you  reply'd the Marquess  as to engage my word for it but the Circumstances are such as make the thing very probable  He then gave him a full account of what was said at Court in relation to it whereat the Earl was extremely satisfy'd being glad to meet with some matter of Consolation tho 'twere only for a few moments He told the Marquess he durst scarce promise to himself so much happiness nevertheless he began to be much better composed in his mind 'Twas this that made him detain the Marquess who intended to return immediately to  London    Stay stay here  said he to him  let us act in concert to deceive me perswade me that the Countess is yet alive But alas  cry'd he  did ever I really believe her to be dead and was able to outlive her I must own to you Brother she has had something of a foresight of what you now confirm to me  The Marquess neglecting nothing which  he judged might strengthen him in this opinion they pass'd that Evening in a very agreeable Conversation  The next and several succeeding Days the Marquess stay'd with the Earl they spent much of their time in Hunting Fishing and Walking▪ At last the Earl desirous to be sometimes alone to ruminate with the more freedom upon the Ad+venture of the Countess of  Devonshire  one day as they were walking near the  Thames  side told the Marquess  Dear Brother I conjure you to permit me to take a Walk without you walk you one way I will chuse another and let us meet again at  Sionhill  Why my Lord  said the Marquess smiling  is my Conversation so tiresom that you can no longer bear with it Alas  cry'd the Earl  I am not able to bear my self  The Marquess heartily compassionating his condition left him alone without saying one word  The Earl of  Warwick  then turning into a Walk upon the very brink of the River seated himself under a Tree where he could not be easily discovered Here he was pondring with himself whether he had best go to  London  in search of the Countess or to write to the Earl of  Pembroke  to be inform'd concerning what had happened at Madam  Digby  's but he was soon check'd in this resolution when he reflected that the Earl had kept it as a Secret from him I told you before that they had seen one another since his return from  Graftonhouse  when he was so far from mentioning any thing of the matter that on the contrary he assured the Earl of  Warwick  that my Lady  Devonshire  was actually dead This made him begin to consider the Earl of  Pembroke  as a Creature of Madam  Gray  and knowing that he had been in the Country with the Earl  Rivers  this Lady's Brother and his  Enemy these Reflections could not but create in him a jealousy against the Earl of  Pembroke  He resolved at last to send  Berincour  to Madam  Digby  's to inform himself of all she knew of that Affair but feared that if my Lady  Devonshire  was really concerned in this Adventure this Curiosity of his might turn to her disadvantage  Whilst he was remaining under this uncertainty he happened to see at some distance upon the River a small Boat and in it a single Gentleman with a Bonnet pull'd over his face row'd only by one Water man He saw them Land near that very place which he had chosen for his Retirement He heard the Gentleman say to the Waterman Go to  Sionhill  and enquire whether the Earl of  Warwick  will not admit of a Visit whether there is no means of delivering a Letter to him and which way he takes his walks when he goes abroad Don't forget any thing I tell you I will stay for your coming back here  The Earl being so near as to understand every word the Stranger spoke had the Curiosity as soon as the Waterman was at some distance from them to know who it was that wanted him so arising from his place  I belong  said he  to the  Earl of  Warwick if you think fit to intrust me with a Letter for him I will infallibly bring you an Answer I know you too well  reply'd the Gentleman surprized to meet him in this place  to mistake your Person I am come here to have your Life or to lose mine  And then drawing his Sword advanced to the Earl  No Quarter No Quarter  cry'd he  defend your self or I will kill you  'Tis easie to be supposed that my Lord  Warwick  who was one of the bravest Men upon Earth would not have have suffered himself to be thus urged by this unknown Person had he  not soon known his voice not doubting therefore but that she was the Countess and that what the Marquess of  Montague  had told him was really true he was overjoy'd to see himself assured by the person her self of her Life but on the other hand being vex'd to the heart to find her so far enraged at him as that no less than his blood would satisfie her he remain'd immoveable like a Statue At last he resolved instead of retreating to meet her  You desire my Life Divine Countess  said he  strike the stroke this is perhaps the only minute I have been able to oblige you  and so was rushing upon her Sword for it was actually she But how soon is a person prepossess'd with a most tender esteem disarm'd by so entire a Submission as this The fair Lady was so surprized to be discovered and so uncertain what to do that she was scarce able to hold her Sword and had it not been for a Tree that supported her she had drop'd down upon the Ground being seized with a most violent trembling She saw the Earl at her Feet embracing her Knees bathing his hands in his Tears and his voice intercepted by a thousand sighs could scarce express the Sentiments of his heart  Rise rise my Lord  said she  I can't suffer to see you at my Feet Oh Madam  reply'd he  Either give me leave to die or restore me to your favours 'Tis so long a time  return'd she  you have laboured to ferfeit them that I know not by what misfortune it is I should not hate you more than I do Have I laboured  said the Earl  to remove my self from your heart alas what way must a man take then to come nearer to it Have not I served you with the same Veneration as they do the Gods No no my Lord  said she  you have made all the ill use you could of a Letter I sent you by  Berincour  How  cry'd he  Do you  mean those two cruel lines you sent to me during my Exilement which alone afflicted me more than all my Disgraces together  'Twas now that they began to unfold their mistake to one another and the Attempt of carrying off the Countess in the Bark whereof she accused the Earl of  Warwick  and whereof he justify'd himself to her satisfaction occasioned no small surprize in them At last she fairly told him she believed the Earl of  Pembroke  or else the  Chevalier de Hereford  were the Persons that did it because they had both made their Declarations of Love to her The Earl now began to be sensible he had been bubbled by the very Person whom he thought his most intimate and now recalling to his mind a thousand passages that happened betwixt them all this served to confirm him in his suspicion  But Madam  said he to the Countess of  Devonshire what is it that could move you to come to kill me What is it I have been guilty of If  to adore you I shall always be so and why will you delay to put in execution a thing that will tend to your satisfaction I will ingenuously confess to you my Lord  reply'd the  had I been acquainted with your real Sentiments I was too much concerned therein to put such a punishment upon you But don't you remember that it was every body's opinion that it was you that made this Attempt and that it was done with my consent How did I know as the case stood whether it was the effect of an excessive Passion whereof we are not Masters at all times or rather of your malice to ruin my Reputation as well in my Family as in the World 'Twas this opinion that made me resolve to purchase my Justification at the expence of your Life I fancied it would prove the truest reparation of my Honour when the  World should be made sensible what Despair had made me do upon that account and I look'd upon it as the only means left me to recover my Repose Well well Madam  said he  don't delay any longe I am ready to sacrifice my self with pleasure for your satisfaction you will at least be convinced what I was capable of doing for you That design drop'd that very moment you were for supporting it tho' I apply'd my self to Fencing whilst I was at Madam  Digby  's on purpose to make the surer work of it but after all I was very sensible that to put it in Execution I should find it a harder task to vanquish my self than you Oh Madam did you not know your self to be at all times the Mistress of my Life  reply'd the Earl  what occasion was there for a Sword or other Arms to take away my Life If you are still of opinion that it may conduce to your Glory never spare an unfortunate Person whom you have made suffer so much Oh my Lord  reply'd she  there is something that protects you against all my anger At least don't insult for the future over my fraity If I must speak it to my shame I can assure you it will afford you no matter of Triumph What is it I have committed  added he  you should deal so rigorously with me Are you afraid I should he apt to flatter my self too much I don't very well know what I fear  said she  but it seems as if I ought to have a secret mistrust of my self in regard to you  The Earl not able to contain himself for Joy was going to throw himself at the fair Countess's Feet when the Waterman returning from  Sionhill  gave an account of his success in his Errand She bid him go and stay for her coming at some distance thence  What will you resolve to do Madam  said the Earl to her  can you imagine I should suffer you to expose your self alone  to new dangers Pray stay for a little time at  Sionhill  we will take care for every thing there  I  will engage never to see you but at such hours as you shall think fit and no body in the world shall know any thing of your being here Alas but  I  shall know it my Lord  cry'd the Countess  and that is enough for me to refuse it Let me undergo what dangers  I  must  I  can't resolve to avoid them by exposing my Reputation by such an Action How will you be gone then cruel person  cry'd the Earl  is it resolved then that the desire you have of avoiding me must make you fall into the hands of a terrible Husband  I  must hide my self  reply'd she  but there is no occasion for you to be concern'd in taking care thereof  I  will go to my Nurse and  I  will take the first Opportunity of going over into  France  Oh Madam  said the Earl  you contrive your own Ruin You may be satisfy'd the Earl of  Devonshire  is inform'd of all that pass'd at Madam  Digby  's He knows  Jamy  was sent thither by your Nurse all the Circumstances that attended this adventure leave no room to doubt but that it was you If you are so nice in this point as not to be satisfy'd in my stay at  Sionhill I  will go to  London  and am ready to depart at that very minute you command it  The Countess after some further Reflections being fully convinced of the danger laid before her eyes by the Earl at last gave way to his reasons but would not let him go to  London  the Night being come insensibly upon them besides that they had a great many things to say to one another before they could well break off their Conversation  The Waterman being sent away the fair Countess in her Man's Apparel went along with the Earl towards  Sionhill  This being the first  time in all his Life he had a full opportunity of Discoursing her with some freedom he was so far transported with joy that he would frequently stop her and begin to rehearse the same thing he had but just said before How happy did he think himself what satisfaction did he not feel within his Breast He feared not long ago that he was hated he dreaded the Death of the Countess but now all his Inquietudes were dissipated at once he had sight of his Countess again and found her not dissatisfied at her not having kill'd him  The Marquess of  Mountague  in the mean while was not a little disturbed at this long stay of his Brother and knowing both his Despair and the multitude of his Enemies feared some ill accident might have befaln him The King's Favour had procured him abundance of them but especially the Earl of  Devonshire  his Family and Friends bore him a moral hatred looking upon him as the cause of their Misfortunes The  Chevalier de Hereford  whose unhappy Passion for the Countess encreased every day considered the Earl of  Warwick  as his most cruel Enemy and Madam  Gray  's Creatures shew'd no less Animosity against him so that the Marquess of  Mountague  no longer able to be at quiet under such a terrible incertitude went out and search'd all those solitary Places whither the Earl used to retire to utter his Complaints and Sighs Making the best of his way he could towards the same Walk whither he had seen him go before he left him that day he espy'd him walking along in Company of a Gentleman who seeming surprized at the sight of him was going to turn another way till the Earl told him  'Fear nothing I will be answerable for my Brother and you are I hope satisfy'd  I will take care not to impose upon you'  Then going forward to kneel and embrace him most tenderly I  can't  said he  but make you a Partner in my Satisfaction this Gentleman is come to bring me some News from the Countess of  Devonshire  if you love me keep the Secret to your self and when we come to  Sionhill  let it be given out he is come to pay you a Visit whereby to amuse and disappoint the inquisitiveness of the Family  The Marquess was overjoy'd at the Confidence the Earl put in him he saluted the Gentleman but taking a narrow View of him found him so beautiful handsom and well made that he was struck with Admiration The oftner he look'd at him the more he was confirm'd in his Suspicion that it was the Countess of  Devonshire  who came to shelter her self at the Earl's House Many other Circumstances such as her Voice the sweetness of her Eyes her modest Deportment and in short her graceful Air were all such things as he thought cou'd not be centred in any other Person but her self  The Earl the Marquess and the Lady supp'd together or to speak more truly sat down at Table for they eat nothing the Earl being quite transported with Joy and the Marquess strucken with Admiration and taken up wholly in viewing the Countess As for her part tho' she was well enough pleas'd with the Earl's Justification and her having found him again she was not without certain Reflections which disturbing her Mind you might have read her Melancholy in her Face The Earl who narrowly observ'd her soon guessing in some measure at her thoughts as soon as he had an Opportunity of speaking to her alone conjur'd her to be at ease  What is it you fear  Madam said he  my Life my Fortune and all my Interests are  at your disposal I will die before I see the least Disgrace befal you Oh my Lord  cry'd she with Tears in her Eyes  The so generous Offers you make me can't satisfy my own Nicety Can you suppose I can see my self at  Sion hill  disguis'd in Man's Habit alone left and abandon'd by my Family reproach'd by every body without conceiving an horrour against my self Don't tell me of my Innocence and the Satisfaction I ought to take in knowing my self not guilty of the least thing that might make me blush neither am I certain whether I may flatter my self of continuing to be such since I know you and as the Saying of  Caesar  in respect to his Wife was always in my Thoughts so I apply the same to my self being more nice of my Reputation than can well be imagin'd What will become of me thus toss'd under these Circumstances If I stay here am I not lost for ever If I go from hence I must expose my self to great Dangers Judge then of my Inquietude 'Tis I  Madam reply'd the Earl  that will go from hence I have already consider'd of the Matter and intend to leave my Brother here He is a sensible and discreet Person I can entirely confide in him whilst I go to  London  to hear how things go whereof I will give you from time to time an exact Account and receive your further Commands  The Countess who approv'd of his Departure cou'd nevertheless not forbear sighing when she understood that he was to be gone the next day She thank'd him for his Complaisance and told him That nothing but such an Accident as this cou'd have engag'd her to see him quit his own House but that the Tranquillity of her Mind in some measure depended thereon  The Countess being inclin'd to go to Bed the Earl left the Room and throwing himself afterwards  upon a Bed with his Brother the Marquess of  Montague  they spent the remainder of the Night in talking of the Countess The Earl did not now in the least regret all his pass'd Sufferings and tho' he foresaw many Difficulties and Obstacles he was likely to meet with in his way every thing appear'd pleasing to him if he cou'd but please the Countess  You make me the Confident of your Love  said the Marquess to him  and tho' this ought to make me proof against her Charms I have Eyes I am not without a Heart I desire you  my Lord  not to expose me to the greatest Danger you cou'd think of It wou'd be an odd Story  reply'd the Earl  that you who have always had an Indifferency for the Fair Sex shou'd now begin with loving the same Person I love No no I know you better than you do your self Don't be frightned with nothing but take care to preserve me a Treasure that is dearer to me than my own Life  The next Morning at Daybreak the Countess got out of Bed and receiv'd the Earl and the Marquess in a most magnificent loose NightGown her Hairs hanging in Buckles upon her Shoulders with a red Bonnet lin'd and edg'd with black Velvet on her Head The Earl was so much delighted to see her in this Dress that for a few Minutes he was not able to utter one word Then kneeling at her Feet  I am agoing to  London Madam said he  my Brother who knows the whole Secret is to stay here to keep you Company to speak of me sometimes to you and to send me frequent Tidings concerning you You put the Marquess  said she  to a needless trouble I desire only some few Books and a solitary Closet where I may be at liberty to entertain my self with my own Thoughts  The Marquess said nothing because he began already to feel the  effects of some Sparks of that Fire he intended to stifle within his Breast But the Earl who minded it not desir'd him to stay behind and then told the Countess every thing that must be imagined to proceed from the most lively tender and respectful Passion in the World and as it was death to him to leave her so he cou'd not forbear to conjure her to let him stay but one Day longer at  Sionhill  Were she to have consulted her own Heart only his Request wou'd scarce have met with a Refusal but she being very uneasy at her being there  Such is my Misfortune  said she  that I must deny my self every thing that may tend to my Satisfaction You know  My Lord  this is a Maxim I have prescrib'd to my self long ago perhaps another Person wou'd not insist upon every punctilio but such is my hard Fate that whatever I do is taken in the wrong sense  At these Words the Tears stood in her Eyes which being perceiv'd by the Earl furnish'd him fresh matter of Grief  Alas  Madam said he  must I carry along with me the Idea of so melancholy a Sight Must I see you cry and is it I that is the occasion of it I I say who love you with so much Tenderness and Respect Is it my Passion that causes you these Sufferings  The Countess return'd no Answer but with her Eyes lifted up towards Heaven remain'd in a pensive posture at last nodding to the Earl  Go go my Lord  said she to him  fly from me I conjure you to do it but never rob me of your Heart  He took leave immediately but with no less Violence to himself than if he were to have taken a Voyage round the World As his unexpected Return to Court supriz'd everybody so the Tranquillity that appear'd in all his Actions was a matter of such a nature as put Madam  Gray  and the Earl of  Pembroke  upon the Rack to know the Cause thereof whilst the King was highly satisfy'd to see his Favourite in the same pleasant Humour wherein he so much delighted and the Earl's Friends took no small share in this Appearance of his Satisfaction  In the mean while the Earl of  Devonshire  and the  Chevalier de Hereford  were come back to  London  to pursue the intended Discovery for having now sufficient Reason to believe that the Countess was alive they were resolv'd to find her out at any rate for which reason they spar'd neither Labour nor Cost and had their Spies in every Corner It had been observ'd that the Earl of  Warwick  attended the King every Night till his going to Bed and then went to  Sionhill  they knew also that the Marquess of  Montague  continu'd here and that the Earl had hired a Famous  Italian  Picture drawer at an excessive rate because he shou'd work for nobody but for him In effect he had sent this Painter to  Sion hill  to draw the Countess's Picture in her Disguise since he look'd upon it as a singular Satisfaction to have her Picture in a Place where he might look upon it as often as he thought fit But she refus'd at first to have her Picture drawn and it cost them several Days before she wou'd be persuaded to consent to it during which time the Painter coming frequently to take a View of her suspected her to be a Woman but had more Wit than to say the least word of it on the contrary he avoided every thing that might render him suspected of having discover'd the truth  The Marquess of  Montague  faithfully discharg'd the Trust he attended the Countess with much assiduity and neglected nothing that might divert her Spleen being carefully seconded by the Earl himself who came thither every other  Day and wou'd have come oftner had not some weighty Reason kept him back He gave an account to my Lady  Devonshire  of every thing he heard and sometimes wou'd add some thing that might frighten and detain her where she was since the Earl's chief Felicity at this time was centred in her being at  Sion hill  As for the Marquess of  Montague  he found to his Cost that all the Resolutions he had taken of continuing indifferent whilst he remain'd with the Countess prov'd too weak by far to resist the force of her Beauty and Merits  My Brother has no real cause of complaint against me  said he to himself  I suffer without seeking for Ease Alas what had I done to him to make me his Confident What if I never was in love before and must he therefore suppose me to be insensible in regard to what is the most amiable thing in the World He has prepar'd such Torments for me as must prove fatal to my Repose  Whilst he was making these Reflections the Earl of  Warwick  as he was a going to  Sion hill  espy'd him sitting at the foot of a rocky Hill near the River side Seeing him so pensive he cou'd not forbear to enquire the reason thereof  I am ready to confess the truth  reply'd the Marquess  'tis because I am in love with my Lady  Devonshire  her Eyes exert their Power no less over me than over you I have hitherto kept a most profound silence tho' I was a thousand times in a mind to break it I don't tell you this to cause in you the least symptom of Pain I am not a Rival dangerous enough to you but can't forgive my self I should make so ill a use of your Confidence in me You wou'd have me my Lord speak to her only of you and I can say scare any thing but for my self You wou'd have me serve you and I am vex'd to the Soul I must do you a Disservice After having made you this Declaration  I  desire you wou'd let me return to  London  whither my Duty calls me and where I shall commit nothing that may occasion any Displeasure in you  The Earl look'd upon him for some time at last embracing him said  Ask me for whatever I am master of in the World I will freely give it you but dear Brother as to your Passion 'tis not in my power to ease you I am very well satisfy'd with your Resolution of returning to Court for I am sensible a small matter more wou'd make me jealous We will go thither together  said the Marquess  and wou'd to God I had never come hither  The Earl return'd no Answer for tho' he lov'd his Brother dearly his Tenderness for the Countess surpass'd all the rest and he cou'd scarce forgive himself to have been so shortsighted as to leave a Person of so much Merit and endow'd with such great Qualifications to entertain the Countess  They went both together to pay their Respects to her and found her very melancholy on account of the insurmountable Difficulties she met with every day which hinder'd her Departure and the Earl did not neglect any opportunity of representing them more dangerous than they really were and afterwards to flatter her with hopes sometimes of the King's Protection sometimes of a Reconciliation betwixt her and the Countess of  Anglesey  her Mother Nay he told her he wou'd if all fail'd carry her into  France  desiring only she wou'd have a little patience so that by these Infinuations he insensibly detain'd her in a place where he had frequently the Satisfaction of being with her As to the Marquess of  Montague  he told her that he finding himself not in a capacity to do her any Service here he wou'd return to  London  to serve her more effectually there She return'd for Answer She was  sorry for his Departure from  Sionhill  that his witty and complaisant Conversation had not a little allay'd the bitterness of her Discontent and that she wou'd not have consented to his going from  Sionhill  but that she hoped her stay there wou'd not be very long He answer'd all her obliging Expressions only with a respectful Silence more intelligible to the Earl than to her who now judging it too hazardous to leave his Brother behind him with the Countess they went together to  London  this being the first time after the Coming of the Countess thither the Earl shew'd any Inclination of going to Town  The  Italian  Picturedrawer gain'd by the pressing Instances of the Marquess of  Montague  had painted for him a Copy of my Lady  Devonshire  's Picture after the Original he had drawn at  Sionhill  An indifferent Satisfaction to a Person so much in Love as he was but he consider'd it as the only thing that might be permitted him without being injurious to his Brother As for the Painter he found the Country so dull that he cou'd not resolve to stay there for any long time but soon fell in Love with a young Woman who was a great Artist in Enamelling However he took effectual care to conceal every thing that pass'd at  Sionhill  Notwithstanding these Precautions the Earl of  Devonshire  having got Intelligence how Matters stood there engag'd the young Female Painter in his Interest The Prospect she had to make her Fortune at once got the better of her Passion for the  Italian  Painter besides she consider'd that by discovering the Countess of  Devonshire  she shou'd not sacrifice her Lover and if the worst came to the worst she did not much fear the Consequences She being resolved so soon as she had got the Mony to go into  Italy  and to settle there 'Twas upon these  Considerations that she engag'd to use all her Endeavours to find out the Countess and her Lover being much more dextrous in his Hands than in his Head she told him she wou'd not believe he had been so long at  Sionhill  that he had made this Story only to serve for a Pretence to get abroad from her and to settle his Love in another place and finding her Lover touch'd with these Reproa  hes she gave him to understand That she should not cease to be jealous till he had fully justify'd himself The poor Picturedrawer overcome by Passion reveals his Master's Secret  The Earl of  Warwick said he  has sent me thither to draw the Picture of a young Lady I know not and whom he is so careful to conceal from my Knowledge that she never appears but in Man's Apparel I have painted her in an  African  Dress I drew her in his presence for he would not stir from us all the while but in spite of all his Precautions I have drawn a Copy of it for the Marquess of  Montague  besides dress'd like a Woman which I will shew you for I must confess she appears more amiable in a Woman's Dress than under her Disguise  The young Woman charm'd with the Countess's Picture conjur'd the Picturedrawer to lend it her because she wou'd take a Copy of it in Enamelwork and he who knew nothing of her Design was willing enough to let her have it and thus the Earl of  Devonshire  was let into a Mystery which they had taken so much care to conceal from him but whereof he had entertain'd some time before a shrewd Suspicion  'Tis easy to be imagin'd he lost not one moment to take effectual Measures to snatch his Wife out of the Earl of  Warwick  's hands being seconded by the  Chevalier de Hereford  both as his Friend and Kinsman and a despis'd Lover They got together all their Friends and in spite  of all the Earl of  Warwick  's Grandeur and being the King's Favourite resolv'd to take such a publick Satisfaction as should appear suitable to the Affront put upon them What injurious Suspicion did they not entertain against the Countess's Reputation 'Tis true in all appearance they had sufficient Reason for it besides that in the utmost transport of their Fury they cou'd have been sorry to find her Innocent  Sion hill  is a very fine Seat without any manner of Defence adapted only to Pleasure as having the Conveniency of beautiful Walks good Hunting and commodious Fishing so that they needed no vast Prepartions to carry away the Countess especially at a time when she thought her self in absolute Security her coming thither being as she thought kept secure They were well inform'd that her Apartment look'd into a Terraswalk and that they needed only to beat out a few Windows to get into it with ease They knew very well that the Earl of  Warwick  whose Courage might have check'd their Design was not to be there that Night so they got into the Garden without the least noise and dividing themselves into several small Parties upon a Signal given all met about the Countess's Lodging Room so that it was impossible she shou'd escape their hands The Business was soon over for they having pitch'd upon that time of the Night when the whole Family was asleep they soon got into the Room where finding somebody in Bed put a Handkerchief into her Mouth soon put her into a Horse Litter which being narrowly watch'd by the Earl of  Devonshire  and the  Chevalier de Hereford  they rid on by the sides of it attended by their Friends conducted it to a Country Seat of the Earl's in the Road to  Windsor  being no great distance from  Sionhill  No sooner were  they come thither and all the Doors order'd to be shut carefully than the Earl of  Devonshire  who had been very silent all this while began to break out into most dreadful Reproaches whilst the poor Captive was brought out of the Litter but instead of seeing the Fair Countess come out all in Tears enough as was suppos'd to move all the Beholders to Compassion they found a young but very ugly ill shap'd Lad half dead with fear Never was a more surprizing  Metamorphosis  seen for many Ages so they went abroad again to hunt out the poor Countess and the Earl of  Devonshire  cou'd scarce forbear to shew his Resentment against him whom he had mistaken for his Lady  The thing happen'd thus which secured the Countess for that time  Berincour  whom the Earl of  Warwick  had appointed to attend her seeing her much out of Humour propos'd to her to take the Diversion of going in a Boat upon the River and himself acting the part of the Waterman he being very shy to trust anybody they were insensibly carry'd down by the Stream at a good distance from the House They were soon after surpris'd by a most violent Storm and  Berincour  mistrusting his Skill in managing the Boat in such  of weather they made the best they cou'd to the next Shore Night approaching and the Tempest continuing they thought it more safe to take up and pass the Night in some adjacent Fishermens  than to return to  Sionhill  which they did accordingly being regaled by these poor Country People with what Beds and other Conveniences their Cottages afforded  In the mean while the Steward and the other Domesticks belonging  g to the Earl of  Warwick  's Family at  Sion  House no sooner heard the noise on  the Terras but they ran thither and found every thing in great disorder the Windows broken the Doors beaten to pieces and all the rich Moveables of the Room destroy'd and not able to guess at the meaning thereof took Horse immediately to notify what had happened to the E of  Warwick  He was then asleep but so soon as he could be spoken with they told him what had pass'd last night at  Sion hill  Alas who is able to express his Confusion at this News Such was his Distraction that he mistook the Lad instead of the Countess not doubting in the least it was she and without giving himself to ask any further Questions sent for the Marquess of  Montague  When he saw him he ran and embraced him  O dear Brother  said he  let us die let us die I could not keep that Treasure wherewith Fortune had entrusted me  and so related to him the whole matter The Marquess no less discompos'd than himself was not in a condition to afford him the least Consolation so they mutually condol'd this Loss and then resolv'd to go straitways to  Sion hill  Never was a small Journey attended with more grievous Symptoms of Melancholy The Earl did nothing but contrive the most violent Resolutions that cou'd be thought of against the E of  Devonshire  tho' to look upon the thing with an unbyass'd Eye 'twas certain he had the least occasion of Complaint but being the King's Favourite 'twas grown into a Custom with him to think he cou'd not be in the wrong When they came in sight of  Sionhill  this seem'd to revive and add new strength to his Fury  See here  said he  the faithless House which cou'd not keep for me what I lov'd so tenderly I will set it on fire I will not leave one Stone upon another and I will proportion my Vengeance to my Despair  The Marquess told him He would assist him with  the utmost Ardour tho' one wou'd have thought it shou'd have been less terrible to him to see his Mistress with her Husband than with a Rival who adored her and whose Merit was so much superior to his  Whilst they were thus riding along the Bank of the River they saw a Boat drawing near the Shoar they knew immediately the Countess and  Berincour  and tho' they cou'd scarce believe their Eyes they leap'd with their Horses into the Water without considering that by the last Nights Rains the River was much swoll'n The Earl's Horse soon getting beyond his depth was carry'd away by the violence of the Current which put him in the utmost danger of being drown'd 'Twas at this very moment the Countess was convinc'd within herself how much more beloved he was by her than ever she had imagined before she set forth most lamentable cries which the Earl had the satisfaction to hear and when soon after she lost sight of him and actually believed him to be lost she drop'd down half dead in the Boat without the least signs of Sense or Motion  Bernicour  not being in a condition to assist her because he and the Waterman they had taken along with them row'd with all their strength to save the Earl's Life which they did most fortunately For the Earl finding his Horse to fall him disentangled his Feet out of the Stirrops and lighting upon a Barge lately sunk there he lays hold of the Mast which stood above the Water till  Bernicour  came to his Aid and took him into the Boat  My Lady  Devonshire  being not as yet come to her self again the Earl threw water in her Face calling her by her Name holding her upright under her Arms and giving her all the assistance that possibly he could she was no sooner recovered  a little but the first Object she cast her eyes upon was the Earl whom she believed to be drown'd  Oh my Lord  said she  what a fright have you put me in How glad I am to see you But Madam  said he  what unexpected good fortune brought you hither when I thought you to be faln into the hands of the Earl of  Devonshire  And how did you make your escape  The Countess appear'd much surprized and discomposed at what might have happened in her Absence She related to the Earl by what Accident she had been prevented from coming to  Sionhill  that Night so that the Earl now remembred it must be his Steward's Son whom they had carry'd off in lieu of the Countess he being used to sleep constantly in the Lower Room to take the better care of its precious Furniture However the Earl and the Countess were both convinced that their Secret had taken vent that the Earl of  Devonshire  was every where in search for her and that she was likely to meet but with a slender Entertainment at his hands  MEMOIRS OF THE Earl of  WARWICK  PART III  THE Earl of  Warwick  and the Countess of  Devonshire  were considering betwixt themselves what an Issue was likely to attend so violent a Beginning and he having taken a resolution to carry her to his fine Seat at  Chelsea  'Nobody in the world shall know the least thing of it said he to her If you come there reply'd she there needs no more to make it known No no Madam I put the greatest hardships in the world upon my self to secure you against your Enemies I am too sensible of the pain the very apprehension of your being seized occasioned in me not to take all possible precautions against such a danger another time which would infallibly cost me my Life Were you sensible of my Sufferings upon that account you would have all the reason in the world to be convinced that there  was never a Passion so perfect as mine'  She being a Lady of uncommon Prudence did not think fit to return a suitable Answer on the contrary being vex'd he had been an eye witness of her falling into a Swoon she imputed the cause thereof before him rather to her surprize than her tenderness for she could have wish'd heartily to conceal from him her Inclinations and how amiable he appear'd in her eyes After some further Conversation they agreed to separate the Earl was set ashore but the Countess stay'd in the Boat to go to  Chelsea  by Water which tho' not the shortest yet was thought the safest way The Earl taking his leave of her with as much tenderness as if it had been for all his Lifetime went on straight to  Sionhill  where he met with his Brother to their mutual satisfaction being glad he had escaped a danger which they expected would have pro+ved fatal to him Being wet to the Skin he changed his Clothes and took a few hours repose  In the mean time the Marquess was got into the Earl's Closet there to afford full liberty to his thoughts  'How hard is my Fate said he I am become a Rival to a Brother who has been always very dear to me I still tremble at the fear I was in of losing him and after all this 'tis he that proves the Cause of all the misfortunes of my Life'  The Earl happening to come in and finding him in this melancholy condition told him  'Don't complain alone Dear Brother I suffer as much as any man can do because I have not resolution enough to resign to you that slender share of advantage I have above you in the fair Countess but believe me all my efforts are fruitless Oh my Lord reply'd the Earl what  is it you tell me Is it possible you should have so much tenderness for me The very intention of breaking your Chains is an unpardonable Crime in you in respect to the Countess If it is my Fate to wear them as well as your self let not my misfortunes interrupt you Pleasures I am sensible I shall pay for it with my Life but is it not reasonable I should do so since I have been so imprudent as to stay with her imagining I could be proof against falling in Love with her I knew unto what a condition you had been reduced and yet was so fool hardy as not to fear the same in my self You have not had sufficient leisure answered the Earl to reflect seriously upon the whole matter It seem'd to me as if her very first Glances did pierce your Heart and if I took not immediate notice of it it was because I believed no body could see her without being struck with Admiration'  The Marquess told him with a deep sigh He durst not ask whither she was gone because notwithstanding all his resolution to shun her he should certainly endeavour to see her  'If this is the case said the Earl of  Warwick  I will not intrust you with the Secret Alas Brother added he is it possible Love should check the Career of our entire Friendship What prejudice have you conceived against me my Lord reply'd the Marquess Am I not sufficiently afflicted don't add to my Pain'  So they run with open arms and embracing one another most tenderly  'Let us Love let us Love cry'd they Let nothing in the world change our mutual tenderness'  It was not long before the Rumour of the Earl of  Warwick  being Drown'd was spread all over  London  and the News thereof was as it happens  commonly in such like cases related with such Circumstances as every one thought most suitable to his opinion the King himself was deceived by so many appearances of Truth that Madam  Gray  with whom he happened to be at that time had the Mortification of seeing him give all the Demonstrations that possibly could be of an excessive Grief He went instantly to  Sionhill  and understood upon the Road what had happened there how the Earl of  Devonshire  thinking to find his Lady there had beaten down the Doors and Windows and carry'd off the Steward's Son  The Earl of  Warwick  in his return to  London  met the King upon the Road who by this giving him such sensible proofs of his Affection he received them with all possible acknowledgment tho' this was not the first time he had known the effects of this Monarch's Goodness The King having told him a thousand obliging things concerning the trouble he had been in upon his account made him come into his Coach and ask'd him Whether it were actually true that the Countess of  Devonshire  had sought for Refuge at  Sion hill  The Earl was put to the greatest  Nonplus  that could be Had it been to the King only he was to impart the Secret of the Countess he would not have hesitated long in the matter especally since the King d  red an ingenuous Confession but knowing that it would soon come to Madam  Gray  's Ears he was too sensible it could not be put into the hands of a worse person who would improve it to do her mischief Upon this Consideration he told the King smiling That he begg'd he would put himself in his place and then tell him whether he wou'd reveal a Secret of a Lady who had put her whole Confidence in him That it was certain  the Earl of  Devonshire  had been deceived by some false Intelligence but that if such a thing should happen that the Countess should have so much Confidence in him as to come to his House he would rather die upon the spot than discover it The King found it would be in vain to ask any more Questions but was not a little dissatisfy'd that his Favourite unto whom he bore so great an Affection should refuse to lay open his heart to him  'Twas an easie matter for the Earl of  Devonshire  to make the Lad whom he had seized confess that  Jamy  had been at  Sionhill  but was not come home that Night and that in all appearance he had changed his Quarters His fury being raised to such a pitch as not to be able to contain it within any reasonable bounds he resolved to pick a Quarrel with the Earl of  Warwick  and accordingly attended by some of his Friends went to  London  where he appear'd the next day in the Playhouse knowing that the Earl of  Warwick  was there before  The noise of what had happened at  Sionhill  being already spead over the Town and these two having not been seen together in one place for some time past every one was more intent upon them than the Play wherein they soon acted a considerable Part For no sooner was the first Act over but the Earl of  Devonshire  advancing with a fierce Countenance towards the Earl of  Warwick  struck him with his Glove in the Face 'Tis easie to guess whether the Earl who was as fierce as he was brave resented such an affront He drew his Sword as the Earl of  Devonshire  had done before and so they made the Stage serve them instead of a field of Battel till those that were there throwing themselves betwixt them patted them at last in spite of  all their endeavours to decide the Quarrel upon the spot They went away but with such furious Looks as sufficiently shew'd they were resolved to fulfil their Revenge and the time and place of the Duel being mutually agreed on they got out of the Court for fear the King to prevent the Combat should put them under Confinement The King actually gave Orders to shut up all the Gates and to go in search for them in all places where probably they might be found shewing himself extreamly uneasie on account of this Quarrel which was not likely to be ended without a fatal Catastrophe Madam  Gray  who knew the Earl of  Devonshire  to be one of the bravest Men in the World and consequently most proper to rid her of an Enemy told the King he ought not to prevent their fighting together that according to all outward appearance the Earl of  Warwick  was Instrumental in concealing the Countess a thing not easie to be digested by an Husband that on the other hand the Earl of  Warwick  having received so signal an Affront could not avoid taking safaction for it  'I understand you Madam reply'd the King with much impatience you are overjoy'd to see your own Quarrel revenged and provided the Earl of  Warwick  have his Throat cut you will easily be prevail'd upon to make his Funeral Oration But I who look upon this matter with quite another eye than you do am sensible I must be a loser let the Event be what it will If the Earl of  Warwick  is kill'd I shall be inconsolable if the Earl of  Devonshire  comes to the worst I lose a Man of Merit so I am resolved to compose the difference let it cost what it will'  In the mean time the two Earls had appointed the Place of their meeting at  BarnElms  a most  delicious Walk upon the River  Thames  about six Miles from  London  Each brought his Second along with him  viz  the Earl of  Warwick  the Marquess of  Montague  and the Earl of  Devonshire  the  Chevalier de Hereford  These two engaged one another not as Seconds usually do out of Complaisance to their Friends but a secret aversion whereof they knew not the cause made them fight most furiously In short they were Rivals and so the Combat did not end till with the Death of the  Chevalier de Hereford  and the Marquess being dangerously wounded fell for dead upon the Ground The Earls of  Warwick  and  Devonshire  fought like two Lions till the last was run through and kill'd and the first received a Wound in the Arm this was the Conclusion of this fatal Combat  The Earl of  Warwick  touch'd to the heart to see the Marquess  Montague  so dangerously wounded and imagining that his Passion for the Countess and the little hopes he had of being beloved had made him careless of his Life began to blame himself for having chosen him his Second  'Alas said he 'tis I that have drawn my Brother into a Quarrel which I ought to have maintain'd alone Was not I very unfortunate when I left him at  Sionhill  with the Countess I knew the force of her Charms was irresistible was it not an imprudent action in me to leave him in so dangerous a place I must die continued he if he dies and if he out lives it I ought to resign to him what he loves being more worthy of her than my self'  All this while he did not neglect to give all possible assistance to the Marquess when he found abundance of Blood trickle down his Arm from a Wound he had not perceived by reason of the heat of the Combat But finding that there was  no long staying for them in this place he got into a Boat with his Brother upon the  Thames  and so to  London  where he kept him concealed till he knew how this matter would be relish'd by the King this done he himself went alone privately to  Chelsea  where he entred his House through a Back door of the Garden whereof he had the Key  Having lost abundance of Blood he look'd out for a place where to take a little rest and making up towards an Arbor which was not as yet covered with Green because it was early in the Spring he espy'd a Woman there and approaching gently found her to be the Countess of  Devonshire  The sight of her caus'd such an Emotion in him as is easie to be guess'd at for the Part he was to act was of such a nature that was to decide of so many things that he did not know how to speak nor how to keep silence At last the same inclination that naturally engages us to follow what we love got the Ascendant over all other Considerations due to the Widow of the Earl of  Devonshire  He drew near with a fearful Look and at once throwing himself at her feet presented his Sword to her  If you believe I deserve your Anger Madam  said he  punish me this is the same Sword which has revenged you upon the Earl of  Devonshire  He is no more among the Living Will you pierce a Heart that adores you  Whilst he was thus addressing himself to the Countess she stood amazed not knowing to what all this tended till she understood that the Man who was the most dear to her in the World had kill'd her Husband She set forth a most lamentable cry and groan'd as if she were giving up the Ghost her eyes open and her body without motion and speech as if she had been turn'd into stone The Earl who knew  too well the Agony of her Soul durst not say one word to her but such was the Emotion of his Spirits as made the blood run afresh from his Wound down his Arm upon the Ground  I am a going to die Madam  said he  if you would have it so I will make no Complaints against my Destiny Yes cruel Man  said she  I desire to see the end of your Life I owe it as a Sacrifice to the memory of the Earl of  Devonshire  you are his Murtherer alas why did you not rather commit this Murther upon me I would pardon you my Death but 'tis not in my power to forgive you his Every thing obliges me to hate you I must declare an implacable war against you and omit nothing to take revenge of you One stroke more  said he to her  you need not look out for any other Arms but your Aversion You see unto what a condition I am reduced I am only afraid my Blood will not run fast enough to satisfie your anger pray make use of my Sword and don't refuse me this melancholy satisfaction of dying by your hands Oh is it in my power Barbarous Man  cry'd she  as if you were ignorant of that fatal Ascendent you have got over my heart Alas you are only too sensible of it you insult over me in that you dare come to present your self before me and still more when you desire your Death at my hands Let me lament at my own leisure the excess of my misfortunes This last Catastrophe has cast me into an unconceivable Despair for I see in your person the Enemy of my Husband of my Children and of my Family and nevertheless suffer you in my presence and don't find within my self those motions of that implacable hatred I ought to bear you Punish me Madam I am at your feet ready to submit to any thing  reply'd the Earl with a low and feeble voice and then his strength failing he lay stretch'd out upon the  Ground covered all over with Blood Speechless and in a cold Sweat  The surprize this Accident caused in the fair Countess is scarce to be conceived At that very instant leaving her Revenge to the Law and the King's disposal and looking upon it as a base Action to fight against a vanquish'd Enemy all her care was bent upon his Relief  Berincour  who had got notice of his Master's arrival and who was in search after him happened to come that way at that very juncture of time and seeing him in Company with the Countess was going back out of Respect She call'd him to her and shewing the Earl whose Head she held with her Hands said  Come to our assistance we are both a going to die Berincour  frighted to the heart to see his Master in such a Condition begg'd the Countess to assist him and then bound up the Wound in his Arm so dextrously that the Blood was stop'd immediately He then went to fetch some Water which he sprinkled into his Face and this with certain Cordial Drops he gave him immediately brought him to himself out of the Swoon that had been occasion'd by the loss of Blood and Spirits and the Emotion he felt at the Reproaches of the Countess of  Devonshire  Overjoy'd to see her so near him  Alas Madam  said he  Is it you Am I worthy of your Pity wou'd you have me live or do you reserve me with an intention to make me a more publick Example of your Revenge  She answer'd not a word but cry'd without intermission The Earl of  Warwick  went slowly to the House supported by  Berincour  But the Countess remain'd in the Arbour to abandon herself to her Grief which being somewhat check'd by the Earl's Presence when she now saw herself alone Good God what melancholy  Reflexions did not she make upon the odness of her Destiny She was Mistress of too great a share of Sense not to foresee the Consequences of so tragical an Accident how the blame of the Earl of  Devonshire  's Death was to be laid at her Door since at the same time she lay concealed at the Earl o  Warwick  's  What other interpretation can this admit of  said she  and who will be able to discern my Innocence involved in so many dark Ridles  She considered herself like a Woman banish'd the World abandon'd by her Relations and Friends Where should she seek for Refuge now How be able to appear at Court How to live a Vagabondlife and lie under a suspicion of a Love Intrigue Her Grief prevail'd so far over Spirits that she was ready to drop down dead when  Berincour  coming very seasonably to her Relief conjured her to give a Visit to his Master in his Chamber  I will never see him more  said she all in Tears  he has robb'd me of my Reputation he has disturb'd the Repose of my Life I am resolved to leave this place let the Event be what it will  Had it been upon another Occasion  Berincour  would have been much surprized at these Expressions but knowing what just cause she had to be thus afflicted he did all that lay in his Power to give her some Consolation At the same time he made such pressing Instances to engage her to see the Earl to consult about their Affairs representing to her that else he wou'd certainly come out to see her that at last she consented to his Requrst  Madam  said the Earl to her  I am too cautious in every thing relating to you to suffer with Patience you should he charged of having too much indulgence for me I would willingly please you 'tis the only Desire and Business of my Life  'tis the only happiness I know of but rather than this Happiness the greatest of all others to me should fall to my Lot at the expence of your Honour I shou'd have Resolution enough to resign it Judge by this whether I make serious Reflexions upon what course you ought to take upon this Occasion Nay I dare go farther and advise you to go immediately to throw yourself at the King's feet and demand my Head for having fought your Husband and kill'd him contrary to the Laws of the Land and without his Majesties Permission But considering that the Earl and Countess of  Anglesey  may not be so soon reconciled to you and that your Husband's Executors out of Prejudice taken against you may be backwards in supplying you with what is necessary to make your appearance at Court I desire you to accept of these Jewels which being of a considerable value will enable you to prosecute me to Death  Are these the Arms you put into my Hands wherewith to fight you O the most generous Enemy that ever was or ever will be  cry'd the Countess  How wou'd you have me make use of your Obligations to Persecute you and to declare myself your Enemy when you heap Favours upon me Leave me my Lord to my own entire liberty to hate you The Road you cut out to come to my Heart is too offensive to me I desire nothing of yours because I would not be charged with Ingratitude when I must act against you  The Earl employ'd all his Rhetorick to persuade her but in vain she had a Soul too noble to burthen herself with such an Obligation After having said many things more or rather all what the nature of so odd an Adventure would admit of  How can I  added she  ask the King to give me Satisfaction proportionable to the Evil you have done me when I owe you already such signal Obligations  And after all tho' the World is not acquainted with the true reason thereof every body has taken such a prejudice against me already that they will believe the whole to be only a Droll No matter for that Madam  reply'd the Earl  it ought to be your Care to have nothing to reproach to yourself let Time and Chance take care for the rest Is it possible  said she  you can imagine I should for the future be your most cruel Enemy And is it possible Madam  said he  you should be so I have always presero'd such pure and respectful Sentiments for you I have had so slender a share in that unfortunate Accident which renders you inconsolable I received so gross an Affront from the Earl of  Devonshire  before I so much as thought of Revenge that if you will examine my whole Conduct you will agree with me that I deserve only Compassion  They continued their Discourse for a considerable time till at last the Earl saw the Countess take her final Leave and that with such an Affliction on his side that he never felt the like before at any time of their Separation  Berincour  attended her to  London  and the Earl went in his Barge the same way accompanying the Boat wherein his adorable Countess was with his Eyes as far as he could and would rather have chosen to follow her to the Worlds end than to have been King of  England  Scarce was the Duel betwixt the Earls of  Devonshire  and  Warwick  over but the dismal News thereof came to the King's Ears and the whole Court Every body run to  BarnElms  some out of Friendship others out of Curiosity but nothing was to be seen there the dead Bodies were removed and the living gone The King was extreamly uneasie at this Accident not knowing as yet the Event or on which side the  Scale had turn'd but was sensible it must needs fall very hard upon the Earl of  Warwick  and the Countess of  Devonshire  for whom he still retain'd some favourable Inclinations notwithstanding his former Grudge to see himself so indifferently treated by her  The Earl of  Warwick  durst not venture to go to Court but writ a Letter full of Respect and Submission to the King begging his Protection against the Widow and Relations of the Earl of  Devonshire  He represented that the Affront given him at the Play House was of such a nature as not to be wiped off but by the Death of his Rival and that he durst not presume to throw himself at his Majesties Feet without his Permission  His Letter met with a favourable reception from the King but nevertheless order'd him to keep himself concealed for some time for fear that if he shou'd immediately appear at his Lodgings at Court the whole Family of the Earl of  Devonshire  would unanimously complain of his partiality to see him in the same degree of Favour as before  The Countess of  Devonshire  upon her arrival in  London  went to her Nurses the only place where she could hope for a kind reception What a strange turn of Fortune for the handsomest Lady in the Kingdom born to so great an Estate and related to all the Great Men of the Court What an odd Change I say for a Lady of her Age who had sacrifie'd her Inclination to her Vertue and who had nothing that was material to reproach her self with 'Tis true her Innocence was her only Comfort and had she been otherwise her Guilt would have much increased her Misfortunes She writ Letters to all her Family she spoke to the Earl's Executors to  act with her in concert to prosecute the Earl of  Warwick  But these were so far from doing so that they treated her very harshly and told her they would bring an Indictment against her and that she had best to look to herself since she would find it one of the hardest peices of work she had ever met with in all her Life A reception so different from what she had promised to herself both surprized and afflicted her to the highest degree She then endeavoured a Reconciliation with the Earl and Countess of  Anglesey  and their Affection for their Daughter was not so far extinguish'd but that it might have been rekindled again had the good effects thereof not been prevented by those that did her a thousand ill Offices with them  All these Misfortunes were not able to subdue her Courage She had taken a Resolution the most difficult of all to demand Justice against the Earl of  Warwick  and all the Obstacles she met in her way was not comparable to that She threw herself at the King's Feet in her Widows Robes and tho' her Eyes were drowned in Tears they had not lost their force The King thought her now a thousand times more handsome than when she first made him her Conquest and the Earl of  Warwick  appear'd a thousand times more guilty to him to have known how to get so far the Ascendant over so charming a Person which had made him kill the Earl of  Devonshire  He promised the Countess to treat her Enemy according to the utmost rigour of the Law being very much pleased to have an opportunity of tormenting her in a way she durst not complain of for whatever precaution she took not to betray her Sentiments by her Looks the young Monarch soon discovered her uneasiness Thus they revenged themselves upon one another  the King by Threatning the Person beloved by the Countess and she in discovering her favourable Inclinations for his Rival  Soon after she found that her Name was inserted also in the Bill presented against the Earl of  Warwick  and that they were for securing her Person to call her to account where she had absconded herself during her Absence from her Family This new Disgrace obliged her to have recourse to the King's Protection which she did one Evening when she knew he had not been very well that Day and that notwithstanding this orders had been given by his Majesty that she should be admitted into his Closer She had a long Veil over her Face and as she was passing in a Chair along a dark Gallery a Gentleman wrap'd up in his Cloak stopping the Chairmen  Whither are you going Madam  said he  Have you forgot the King's Passion and what Praises he has bestowed upon you but lately Oh cruel Woman you intend to make me a Sacrifice to this dangerous Rival you will rekindle the old Flame  The Countess by these Words knowing him to be the Earl of  Warwick Alas don't you know  said she  what a Condition I am reduced to wou'd you have me destroy'd by my Enemies And are not you of the same opinion with me that the King is so deeply enamour'd with Madam  Gray  that he thinks no more of me I cannot rest satisfy'd upon that Point  reply'd the Earl  I am sensible that the Impressions you make are too lively to be soon defaced If the King sees you once more he will certainly fall in Love with you I came just now from him and it was he that told me he expected your coming he waits for you with the utmost impatience but Madam for God's sake don't go thither secure me against a Misfortune I foresee will befal me  You make me afraid of myself my Lord  said he  I don't desire to be beloved by the King speak to him in my behalf and get an order from him for me to be admitted into a Nunnery for since I can't see you without being Criminal contrive it so that I may see nobody in the World  The Earl overjoy'd at this extraordinary piece of Complaisance of the Countess return'd her a thousand thanks assuring her he would omit nothing to obtain the Order she desired from the King However when he began to intimate to the King the resolution the Countess had taken of retiring into a Nunnery this Prince told him he would never consent to it and that since she had no such Thoughts when he saw her last this must be the product of his Counsels to her The Earl being not a little surprized at the King's Answer was now fully convinc'd that neither Time nor all the Charms of Madam  Gray  had been powerful enough to rase out of the King's Mind the Impressions made there by the Countess of  Devonshire  and that therefore it was high time for him to persuade her to conceal herself  Tho' the Earl of  Warwick  's Authority was very great at that time in  England  yet out of a Decorum in respect of the Death of the Earl of  Devonshire  he saw none but his intimate Friends The Marquess of  Montague  did the same his Wounds proving so dangerous that his Life was more than once despair'd of because the little care he took of it proved a great hinderance to his Cure The Earl of  Warwick  wou'd fain have been constantly with him but his Passion for the Countess of  Devonshire  call'd him to other Places where he might do her the most effectual Service  This fair Widow as soon as she understood the King's refusal to let her go into a Nunnery was contriving a place of Retirement where she might remain unknown to all the World She stood in need of the Earl of  Warwick  's assistance without which she found it would be very difficult for her to compass her Designs He caused to be purchased a House privately which made but a slender appearance on the out side but so magnificently adorn'd within that the Palace of  Psyche  built by Love itself could not be more pleasant or more agreeable The Countess was very willing to accept of this Retirement pr  ided the Earl of  Warwick  wou'd not come there to see her being persuaded that she could not without Guilt continue a strict Correspondence with a Man who had kill'd her Husband And the Earl fearing lest she shou'd be discovered in her Lodgings unless she went thither with all possible speed promised to do every thing she desired The Earl of  Warwick  sent  Berincour  to attend her at her new House whilst he stay'd at  London  with the Marquess of  Montague  He had been in no small danger from his Enemies could the King have been prevail'd upon to leave him to their Mercy but the Friendship he bore him put a stop to their Designs so that tho' they without intermission reiterated their Instances for the King to leave him to the ordinary course of the Law he always found means to put them off by ambiguous Answers till they were convinced that all their Sollicitations were likely to be in vain The Countess on the other hand now began to flatter herself that living in this place of Retirement without the least noise or lustre she wou'd soon be forgot by all the World when the Earl of  Pembroke  now deeper in Love with her than ever he had been before  found out her House and left no stone unturn'd to get admittance there 'Tis true this was no casie task to be compass'd but in  England  as in most other Countries there are few things which may not be purchased by Money  The Earl found means to engage one of the Countess's Waiting women into his Interest she opened to him a little Back gate by which he entred into a most curious Flowergarden where her Mistress used to walk every Night He lay concealed betwixt a Hedge of Trees when he saw her coming along negligently dress'd in Mourning and more beautiful than the Mother of Love her self The sight of her put him into an unspeakable confusion for if he loved her beyond all the World he respected her no less and feared to disoblige her if he accosted her She will doubtless says he be offended at the liberty I take All the imprecations I can make will not clear me from the suspicion she has conceived of my being one of the most intimate Friends of Madam  Gray  Nay perhaps she may fancy I am in Love with her but she will scarce think it worth her while to reflect thus far the happy Earl of  Warwick  takes up all her thoughts and she little concerns her self about me The Countess had already taken several Turns in the Garden before he durst venture to come out from behind the Hedge but at last he did throwing himself immediately at her feet She frightned to the heart run away and the Earl thinking she knew him and that what she did was out of an aversion to him resolved to make her sensible of the Torments he suffered for her  No Madam  said he keeping her back  No I don't come here to deplore at your feet these unconceivable Evils you make me suffer I come here to load you with  reproaches as being the most cruel of all Women living I come I say to complain of that unjust Preference you give to the Earl of  Warwick  to the Man who has kill'd your Husband to him who is the Enemy of your Family 'tis him you have chosen your Confident your Protector and the dearest of your Friends whilst I lead a lingring unfortunate Life which it is impossile for me to hold without pleasing you and which I intend to sacrifice to you if you don't think it worthy your care There is so little reason in what you say  reply'd the Countess moved at his Reproaches  that a Man must be very presumptuous to come to a place where I will be seen by no body to upbraid me with my misfortunes once for all my Lord I forbid you to come here any more  The same moment the Earl of  Pembroke  espy'd the Earl of  Warwick  what a surprizing sight for an amorous and jealous Person He did not question but that they had an Interview every Night in that Garden and that there was a very strict Correspondence betwixt them as the Earl of  Warwick  on the other hand was not a little exasperated at the sight of him in that place  How is it you my Lord  cry'd the Earl of  Warwick is it possible your Curiosity should lead you so far beyond its bounds as to forget what is owing to a person of that Quality and Merit as my Lady  Devonshire  is And you my Lord your self  reply'd the Earl fiercely  don't you set me a good Example Have not I as much zeal and respect for her as you have I not an extream ambition to serve her And in a word have I been accessary to her misfortune All this signifies nothing  answered the Earl of  Warwick  briskly  there is no comparison betwixt your Passion and mine but this is not a place fit to dispute this matter in  The Earl of  Warwick  carrying his Arm still in a Scarf  Scarf the Earl of  Pembroke  was ready to burst  madness because he had for a considerable  me past been very desirous to fight him and whilst they were discoursing together the Coun  ess took this opportunity of absenting her self  eing vex'd to the Soul to see her self discover  d in her Retirement this being her chief Consolation at that time to hope to remain conceal'd from all the world  As for the Earl of  Pembroke  he used frequently to commit such Errors in his Passion as he heartily repented of afterwards and so it happened in this case He run away like a Madman to Madam  Gray  and told her what he had seen in relation to their common Enemies She pleased to the heart to have found so fair an opportunity of revenging her self of them without more ado told it to all the World that the Countess of  Devonshire  not satisfy'd to have drawn so many misfortunes upon her Family liv'd near  London  in a House belonging to the Earl of  Warwick  This piece of hers so nearly touch'd the whole Family of this Lady that it is not to be express'd how many ill effects it produced to her and the Executors of the late Earl obtain'd an Act laying a Fine of one hundred Marks of Gold upon the Earl of  Warwick  to be paid by him as often as he should go to see her  The Earl was little concern'd thereat as on the other hand it proved some satisfaction to the Countess  I shall now  said she  be freed from the hazard of receiving his Visits which must have always been attended with a thousand troublesome Consequences A long Absence is sometimes requisite to perform a Cure  But after some further reflections  Dare I  added she  flatter my self with the enjoyment of any Tranquility Have not I  found by experience that ever since that fatal Day I first saw the Earl it has not been in my power to forget him what attempts have I not carry'd on against my own heart I can't upbraid my self with having been too indulgent to him Would it please Heaven the world was as well convinced of the uprightness of my Sentiments as I am  Being fully resolved to lead a reserved life the King's endeavours to see her proved all in vain she was not for furnishing new matter of Discourse upon her own account and therefore rejected all his offers with as much resolution as respect The King laid the fault thereof upon the Earl of  Warwick  How far she is prepossess'd in his behalf said he speaking of her and how he tries my patience to the utmost to dare to love where I love These Reflections began by degrees to make him rase out of his Memory the Remembrance of the Services and the Acknowledgments he ow'd to the Earl he forgot it was he who had put the Crown on his head or if he remembred it it was to be sorry he ow'd him such an Obligation 'Tis certain that any man less in love or less generous than the Earl of  Warwick  would have been very cautious to incur a Fine of an hundred Marks of Gold but he slighted it and if he took any precaution at all when he went to the Countess it was only not to expose her to the Discourse of others  His Impatience of seeing her carrying him above all other Considerations he used no other disguise than a Cloak so alone he went very late at Night Her surprize when she saw him come into her Room was such that nothing can be compared to it  Do you consider my Lord  said she  what you do you furnish our common Enemies with Weapons to fight us and how dearly will you pay for this useless Visit you give me Provided  it is not displeasing to you  reply'd he  I  ave considered of all the rest Madam I don't  hink this satisfaction too dearly bought tho' I  ay one hundred Marks of Gold for every time I have the honour of seeing you and I should never be much concerned about the Fine if you would but give me leave to run the hazard of paying it oftner There is but little reason for what you tell me  added she  but my Lord you ought not only to have a regard to your own satisfaction in this Business but also to my Reputation which ought to be a thousand times dearer to you Reflect upon what the World will think of me if you come to visit me I am still the Widow of the Earl of  Devonshire  Oh Madam you are still the most cruel Woman to me in the world  replies the Earl  My Passion my Constancy my Respect nothing is able to open my way to your heart you always continue to be rigorous to me  The Countess return'd no answer to these reproaches but lifting up her eyes to Heaven fetch'd a deep sigh  He stay'd as long as she would give him leave but the Visit was soon discovered for they had their Spies who observed every body that went in and out at my Lady  Devonshire  's so the Earl being Convicted was forced to pay the Fine which he did with so noble a freedom as tended more to the confusion of his Enemies than caused the least dissatisfaction to him The King could not forbear to speak to him about it  Is it possible  said he  you should go about to be your own ruin and that you should not have Conduct enough to forbear Visiting my Lady  Devonshire  Did your Majesty but know how far my Extravagancy exceeds all bounds you would not speak to me thus For Sir to confess the truth hitherto I can say I have not seen one minute which might flatter me to be beloved I come to her against  her Consent I submit to all the harsh rebukes she imposes upon me and to make up the matter they make me pay an hundred Marks of Gold I can scarce believe you  said the King Laughing  certainly at that rate you are fit for a dark Room with nothing but straw in it  The Countess understood with the greatest vexation that could be how the Earl of  Warwick  had paid the Fine and that this last accident was enough to set even those who had entertain'd a good opinion of her hitherto against her Her affliction was so excessive that she cry'd for many days together The Earl who received constant News from her could not be at rest till he gave her another Visit in hopes to afford her some Consolation but being no more cautious than before he was discovered a second time and was forced once more to pay the same Fine The King threatned him with his Disgrace unless he could alter his measures and the Countess of  Oxford  was so far exasperated against the Countess of  Devonshire  that she join'd her Interest with Madam  Gray  and all the rest of her Enemies to tear her quite to pieces  This Aversion had its rise from a most furious Jealousie she had conceived against her because they had always been Rivals in point of Beauty and the Countess of  Oxford  who was infinitely fond of her Husband had taken a fancy that he sighed for my Lady  Devonshire  perhaps she was not in the wrong of it but if he did his Destiny was the same with all the rest of those that loved her Notwithstanding all this this Lady having conceived a hatred against her took upon her to make a most desperate noise about the Earl of  Warwick  's Extravagancies He was heartily vex'd at it but to no purpose he left off visiting her but this served only to exasperate her the more  which made her spread abroad abundance of Fa  lous Stories which pass'd for true ones Ac  ording to he course of the World it is enough  at the Darts of a slanderous Tongue thrown  gainst a handsome Lady are back'd by a multi  de to make them exert their full force espe  ially if she be under the Clouds and her Beau  y and Charms attract more Envy than Compas  on  The Earl of  Warwick  almost reduced to de  pair to see so many obstacles in his way contri  ed a certain Subterraneous Vaulted passage  eaching to the Countess of  Devonshire  's House  this Passage were several spacious Apartments adapted to the two Seasons of the Year those for the Summer being crusted over with fine Marble and other costly Stones those for the Winter were Wainscoted with the finest Wood He laid out besides this above  l  erling  in rich Moveables such as Brass Sta  ues Gold Silver and Crystal Vessels Brocad  d Beds and such like so that those of his in  imate friends whom he admitted to the sight  hereof thought they had been brought into an  nchanted Palace These Apartments being fi  ish'd with all possible expedition he writ to the Countess the most respectful and the most engaging Letter that could be conjuring her to make  is the place of her Retirement from whence he would open a door into her Garden if she would be pleased to give her Consent But she  hew'd so invincible an aversion to it and reject  d his Proposition with so much haughtiness  hat he had but little hopes of seeing her setled  here  This put him under an extraordinary perplexity for several days which the Marquess of  Montague  who was then with him taking notice  of  'I can't without some regret said he enquire after your Secret because you will perhaps imagine my curiosity to proceed rather from my own than your Interest But my Lord let your opinion be what it will upon that head I can't forbear to take my share in your Grief and look upon it as if it were my own Oh Brother you need not fear to be suspected by me cry'd the Earl My affairs are reduced to so lamentable a condition scarce any body will go about to cross me The Countess of  Devonshire  forbids me to see her and I know not what to think of so rigorous a Sentence The King loves her still How cry'd he shall the lustre of his Crown deface the Merits of my Passion Does she know that if I would have consulted my own advantage only I might sit in the same Throne whereof I put him in Possession So generous an Action as this is it not worthy of the highest Esteem I can scarce believe said the Marquess she should prefer the King to you and would it please Heaven her heart were prepossess'd by no other but him But my LordI understand you Brother said the Earl you love her still but the Consideration you have for me makes you not embark upon this fatal Ocean you don't know as yet how terrible it will prove to you but don't take my word for it don't check your Passion longer upon my account if it is my Destiny to meet with Rivals you will be instrumental in helping me to vanquish them and if Fate will not afford me the satisfaction of being beloved by her make your self to be beloved it will afford me some sort of Consolation'  The Marquess transported with joy at what he told him embraced him most tenderly  'And how My Lord said he do you give your Consent for me to serve your Divine Countess What you just now spoke to me does it proceed from some sudden motion or is it owing to your more serious Considerations Don't trouble your self reply'd the Earl about the reason that made me say so but make the best of it if you can'  The Marquess of  Montague  did not think fit to push the matter any further for that time and he was so taken up already with the flattering Idea of pleasing the Countess or at least of endeavouring it or to die at her feet if she would not suffer him to live for her that he could think of nothing else than how to put his Design in execution This proved no easie task for she had taken such precautions to avoid the Visits of the King and of the Earls of  Warwick  and  Pembroke  that her House was as narrowly guarded as a Fort Notwithstanding all this the Marquess got in she was surprized to hear his name and hesitated for a while whether she should give him admittance he being Brother to the Earl of  Warwick  who had been his Second in the late Duel but it was not in her power to rob her self of the pleasure of hearing some news or other from him and as she expected he brought her some she had not strength enough to refuse him The Marquess accosted her with such symptoms of fear in his Face as much surprized her I  am come Madam  said he  to justifie my Conduct perhaps you have been told I knew before hand of their Quarrel which occasioned the Duel doubtless I should have been acquainted with it had I been in  London  but happening to go out of Town that very day when they quarrelled in the Playhouse I came to  London  again at that very time when my Brother had occasion for me He only desired me to meet him at such a place which I did but give you leave to guess what surprize I was in when  I  saw there the Earl of  Devonshire  and the  Chevalier de Hereford  This last attack'd the first and I need not tell you the rest you being fully inform'd of it  Alas my Lord  said she  don't recal to my Mind such dreadful Misfortunes however it affords me some Consolation to see you take so much pains to justifie yourself  She fetch'd a deep sigh and the Marquess highly perplex'd whether he had best to speak or no threw himself at her Feet like one out of his Senses Never was a surprize comparable to hers for she immediately discovered the Secret Symptoms of an amorous Heart which hitherto had concealed its Fire  You see here Madam  said he with a trembling voice  a most miserable Victim offered to satisfie your Anger and if to worship you as we do the Sun that gives us Light is the way to incur your Displeasure I am the most Guilty among all your Adorers 'Tis the Fate of your Family  cry'd the Countess  to disgrace mine What is it I have done to you to cause me so much dissatisfaction Rather say Madam  reply'd the Marquess  What Crime have I committed to be thus exposed to your Indifferency You don't so much as think me worthy your Anger Oh Madam I am a thousand times more unfortunate than I thought myself to be Does the Earl of  Warwick  know  added she  of your coming hither Yes he knew of it  reply'd the Marquess  he made his Complaints to me and believed questionless by woful Experience that my Destiny would be no better than his But Madam since decency permits you not to chuse him for your Spouse the same  reason does not hold I think in respect to me I  in a condition to protect you against the violent  ddresses of the King and the Animosity of your  nemies I dare assure you there are certain  amilies that will not see themselves tamely op  ress'd and my Brother will see my Happiness with satisfaction Is it possible what you tell me  ould be true  reply'd the Countess interrupting him  If it be so 'tis time to die Good God what is it I hear  said the Marquess  I had flatter'd myself too much  Whilst he remain'd overwhelm'd in a deep Study the Countess full of melancholy Thoughts fram'd a thousand confused projects which all tended towards her leaving  England  But the King having taken effectual care to stop her Passage in all the SeaPorts twas in vain to make an attempt of that Nature  The Marquess took his leave of my Lady  Devonshire  more amorous and more afflicted than any Man upon Earth for he had flattered himself she would not be averse to change her Name for his The Grandeur of his Family the King's Favour the Applause of the People but above all his personal Merit seem'd to plead so far for him as that he needed scarce fear a refusal But tho' my Lady  Devonshire  was yet very young she had such cruel experiences of the Inconstancy of Humane Affairs she had seen so many melancholy Days and Hours that all her aim now tended to nothing else than how to spend her Days in Tranquillity by concealing that fatal Beauty which no body could look upon with Indifferency  The King continued his Visits to Madam  Gray  with the utmost Application and at the same time left no stone unturn'd to do the Earl of  Warwick  all the ill Offices he could with  Lady  Devonshire  Besides that he was no less assiduous to persuade Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  that he loved none but her such variety of Gallantries as it could not make him really happy so it could not be pleasing to his Mistresses Madam  Gray  being a Lady of the nicest Vertue had got an absolute ascendant over the King which she could not have maintain'd long had she not been one of the most cunning Women of her Age she began to be weary to see herself put off from time to time in her Marriage with the King  You know Sir  said she  upon what Condition you engaged me to change my Solitude for the Court I don't think it reasonable that the desire of keeping your Promise should engage you into a business of ill Consequence but it is also less reasonable I should continue any longer in a place where I may be justly suspected of shewing some criminal Complaisance you have promised me every thing I ask you for nothing Sir except your permission to avoid you Consider a little the present state of my Affairs  cry'd the King  I am scarce settled in the Throne and which is still in contest betwixt me and those of  Lancastor  They have still a Party who will not fail to make use of the least suspicion of our Marriage to create a jealousie in the  English  Nation and you will see the Earl of  Warwick  whose Power is only too great at the Head of them you know the enmity he bears you If therefore you will but afford me a little time I will endeavour to the utmost of my Power to give you entire Satisfaction Your Majesty deceives yourself when you talk to me in this manner Sir  added Madam  Gray I am too well acquainted with this kind of Language to be much mistaken in it I am not ignorant Sir of your Passion for the Countess of  Devonshire  I know your Sentiments  for Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  I don't intend to be any longer an obstacle in their way I have a kind of Pride within me which tells me a divided Heart is not worthy of mine  The King answered to the fair Widows Reproaches in the Stile of a Passionate Lover tho' at the same time he took no farther care to discharge his Promise to her all his Thoughts being quite taken up with my Lady  Devonshire  he was resolved to see her but knew not how because she had changed her Habitation and kept the Secret from every body except a very few Persons whom she knew to be trusty and silent He was continually tormented with these Desires and believing the Earl of  Warwick  the only happy Person the Obligations he ow'd his Rival caused no small vexation in his Mind As the Earl of  Pembroke  had always had a considerable share in his Favour and that he had observed of late much coldness betwixt him and the Earl of  Warwick  he pitch'd upon him for his Confident  'I never ceas'd  said he to him  to love the Countess of  Devonshire  her Deportment vexes me to the Heart my Honour seems now to be concern'd in it she avoids me she hides her self  Warwick  is the Man who has all the Preference I wou'd make her love me to revenge myself both of her and him endeavour to find her out and I will make it my business to please her'  The Earl of  Pembroke  accepted this Commission with great Satisfaction because he was absolutely at Variance with the Earl of  Warwick  who had loaded him with bloody Reproaches calling him an ungrateful faithless Man and  Pembrook  not accustomed to take such Language had return'd him a suitable Answer so that since  that time they never saw one another but in the King's Presence His Passion for the Countess was turn'd into a kind of Madness and he felt all the rage of a most direful Jealousie and such a Despair as is almost inseparable from an unfortunate Lover It came into his Head to advise the King to send out of the way the Earl of  Warwick  he proposed it to his Majesty accordingly who highly approving his Conceit they had nothing more to do than to find out a fair Pretence  I told you before there was an implacable hatred betwixt Madam  Gray  and the Earl of  Warwick  the Earl knew she had sacrificed him to the King and that in some measure she had been the occasion of the Disgrace of my Lady  Devonshire  and Madam  Gray  on the other hand believed it was him who had hitherto dissuaded the King from marrying her So the Earl of  Pembroke  judged her a proper Subject to enter into their Consultation of removing this Favourite from the King His Age and Circumstances requiring he should think of a Spouse three Parties had been proposed  viz Margaret  Princess Royal of  Scotland Isabella  Heiress of  Castile  marry'd afterwards to the King of  Aragon  and  Bomua  Princess of  Savoy  Sister to  Charloite  Spouse to  Lewis  XI King of  France  The King pretended to pitch upon the last and spoke to the Earl of  Warwick  about it no otherwise than if he had really intended the Match and the Earl who always feared he might Marry Madam  Gray  took this opportunity to represent to him all the Advantages he was likely to reap of this March He told him that  Margaret  of  Anjou  whose Courage was as great as her Misfortunes was continually solliciting for Troops for  Lewis  XI to conduct them  into  England  and endeavour the Reestablishment of  Henry  in the Throne but that he having once marry'd that King's Wife's Sister she could not expect any Succours there And in short omitted noching he thought requisite to convince the King of the necessity of pursuing that Design  The King then told him that this being a Negotitation of such Consequence he could not cast his Eyes upon any body who was likely to acquit himself better of so great a Trust than himself and that therefore he wish'd he would without losing Time in the preparing or staying for his Equipage go directly to the  French  Court  The Marquess of  Montague  stay'd for his return from Court at his own House  'Dear Brother  said the Earl to him  I am going into  France  upon the King's Service and for the Countesses Tranquillity I hope that such a Princess as  Bonna  of  Savoy  will fix him so that we may not see him in Love with every handsome Woman he meets that Madam  Gray  may be removed from Court and that at last he may be mindful of what we have done for him I must see my Lady  Devonshire  I must give her an account how Matters go and receive from her Mouth the Rules of my future Conduct'  'Go go my Lord  answered the Marquess full of Grief  you will meet with a good Reception 'tis not you she intends to avoid 'tis the King 'tis the Earl of  Pembroke  'tis my Lord of  Oxford  and alas 'tis myself Pray Heav'ns it prove so  cry'd the Earl  but 'tis only too true that my Destiny is the same she listens to her Duty before her Inclination she has banish'd me since I fought her Husband and you may guess at it by the Care she has  taken to conceal herself more from me than from you however Brother tho' she hates me I recommend her to you as that which is most dear to me in the World you are of yourself sufficently disposed to serve her so that it is less needful to urge it to you but I shall think my self as much indebted to you as if you did it with reluctancy Alas my Lord  reply'd the Marquess  how shall I be able to answer your Desire You are acquainted with my Passion I have chosen you for my only Confident and notwithstanding this I check my Passion so far as not to be jealous of your good Fortune I will then serve her in your Name as if it were for myself What can you ask more from the most unfortunate Man upon Earth'  He said no more nor did the Earl return any Answer but taking the first opportunity of getting away unperceiv'd by any went to the Countess She had chang'd both her Name and Habitation The Earl who was inform'd of every thing took nobody along with him for fear of being discovered and carry'd with him a Billet he had writ before which he delivered to the Person that let him in without desiring to be admitted into the House  The Countess read the Billet with an extream Emotion She was surprized at the Earl's Departure and under a great uncertainty what to resolve upon How was it possible she should let him go into  France  without seeing him and how was it possible to see him without exposing herself to the hazard of a thousand Misfortunes However her Inclinations got the better of her Prudence and she admitted the Earl into her Closet  'Is it possible my Lord  said she  you shou'd find me out every where Is it not high time you shou'd let me die in Tranquillity  You know what Apprehensions I live under from those who hate me'  'Don't reproach me with my Passion Madam  reply'd the Earl  I have acted beyond my strength in checking my Inclinations to see you but could you be so rigorous as to command me to go out of the Kingdom without giving me leave to conjure you to go along with me I will find out a way to get you safely aboard must I leave you at  London  whilst I am a going to  Paris  And is it in my Power to follow you my Lord  cry'd the Countess  Under what Colour can I take such a Resolution Pray consider my real Interest and then tell me whether it is possible for me to do it'  'Were the Danger you are likely to be exposed to less than it is  answered the Earl  I should perhaps not urge you so far as I do to avoid it but Madam take my word for it the King's Thoughts are not so much taken up with Madam  Gray  nor with Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  nor with his intended Marriage with the Princess of  Savoy  but that he thinks of gaining your Heart The difficulty he meets with in the Conquest thereof serves only to enflame his Desire his Glory and Pleasure To be short Madam he is a King he is amiable handsome and witty what is it I have not to fear Nothing at all my Lord I assure you  said she  Nothing at all 'tis true you are not a King but it was your own fault you were not one for the rest you yourself know that the King has not gain'd the least advantage upon my Heart would it please Heaven I could treat you with the same Indifferency as I do him Then come into  France added the Earl throwing himself at her Feet  Come divine Countess hasten to appear in a Court where you may expect to meet with a  reception suitable to your Merits let us remove from this I am very sensible that the King has conceived a secret Aversion against me a considerable time ago notwithstanding all his precaution to conceal it from me and if you cou'd once leave  England  you shou'd soon see me leave it also'  'My Lord  said the Countess with a melancholy and most serious Air  Your Passion touches me too nearly to repay it with Indifferency in spite of all the Rules of Decency which prescribes me to have quite other Sentiments for you I am not so far Mistress of myself as to follow them If this Confession may afford you any Consolation taste the full Sweets of it But after all this my Lord neither wish nor ask for any more I shall avoid you all the Days of my Life and am convinced that since I can't see you I shall fly from all the World Yes my Resolution is fix'd we are both Unfortunate neither is it possible we should condole our Misfortunes together every thing is against us we can't even have that miserable Comfort of intermixing our Tears and Sighs'  'Who has prescribed you such severe Laws'  reply'd the Amorous Earl  and what is it that renders me so odious don't flatter me with any particular Respect I see the utmost extent of my Disgrace for unless you did hate me how could you take such Resolutions as you do The Countess persisting in the same Sentiments Don't imagine  added she  that when I say I won't go along with you into  France  I don't intend to go thither but I will take my own time to go privately and I must tell you I will do all I can to conceal it from you I dread you more than any other Person because I have a high esteem for you The  Motive is highly obliging but the Consequence favours of Cruelty'  reply'd the Earl with something of Anger in his Countenance and having paused a while  'Well Madam since I can expect nothing from you don't refuse my Brother he adores you he is a Person of Merit do him Justice make him your Husband his Happiness will be my Comfort and your Vertue will sufficiently secure him against the suspicion he might conceive in regard to the King'  'Oh my Lord  cry'd my Lady  Devonshire I can't pardon you this great Error in point of Nicety No the Marquess of  Montague  shall never have my Hand no nor the greatest Monarch of the Universe That fatality which hinders me from joining yours with mine shall not enforce me to accept of your Brother's but once more is it possible you shou'd be contented I should become your Sister in Law'  Alas Madam  reply'd the Earl kissing her Hand against her Will  'I know not what I would have when you take away all hopes from me I lose my Reason and fall into such a degree of Despair as wou'd move Compassion in any other Person but you The Countess all in Tears gave him some tender Looks and both their Hearts were so far overcome with Grief that they could not utter one Word for some time'  It was at last agreed betwixt them she should reassume her Disguise the better to conceal herself and suffer herself to be conducted in a Man's Apparel by the Marquess of  Montague  to that beforementioned stupendious subterraneous Palace the Earl of  Warwick  had built on purpose for her The Earl did take his leave but with the utmost Grief he saw very well he might flatter himself to be beloved tho'  he purchased this Happiness at a very excessive rate  The Earl of  Pembroke  could think of no better way to find out the Countess of  Devonshire  's Retirement than to have the Earl of  Warwick  dogg'd where ever he went not questioning but that he would see her before he went into  France  His faithful and dextrous Spies had been so watchful in their Employment that about Midnight they came to tell him that the Earl was gone into one of the most remote corners of the City and that questionless 'twas thereabouts the Countess had fix'd her habitation In the mean while the Earl of  Warwick  having taken his leave of the King Embark'd for  Calais  of which place he was Governour having before hand given directions to the Marquess of  Montague  what was to be done in his absence and he might well rest assured of all his love as long as the Interest of the Countess was concerned  Accordingly the same Night he conducted her with two Waiting women disguised all three in Mens habit to this stupendious Vault which for its beauty might challenge a preference to the most Magnificent Palace The Countess was so much surprized thereat that notwithstanding the trouble she was then under she could not forhear to admire the Rarities of the Marbles and Wainscotting tho' all the precious Moveables were taken out before There were several Closets or Retiring places the Doors whereof were so artificially contrived that no body but who was very well acquainted with it could open them The Marquess shew'd the secret openings thereof to my Lady  Devonshire  and fearing least she should forbid him to come to see her if he continued to entertain her with his Passion he chose  rather to do so much violence to himself as to speak to her only with his Eyes She had too great an Esteem for him to shew her self insensible to so rare and noble a Deportment she defired him to be assured of her Esteem and to visit her now and then to comfort her in her Misfortunes  At the same time the Earl of  Pembroke  persisting in his Resolution of giving the King an account of the Countess had placed himself in Disguise also not far from the before said Subterraneous place when he saw the Marquess of  Montague  coming along with the Countess of  Devonshire  whom he knew notwithstanding the darkness of the Night and her Disguise having seen her in the same Habit at Madam  Digby  's but had she appear'd in another Dress how was it possible for him to mistake her That fatal Arrow which pierced his heart when he met her at  Chelsea  with the Countess of  Oxford  I say that same Arrow remain'd still in his heart with this difference only that now he felt himself tormented only with the most cruel Jealousie that could be that he lived without hopes and that he acted like a Man who cared not what he did He run straight to the King and told him where my Lady  Devonshire  was lodged and this Monarch seeing himself now freed from that respect he preserved for the Earl of  Warwick  thought of nothing else than how to surprize an unhappy person destitute of all Protection and oppress'd by her Enemies For this purpose he pitch'd upon a very dark Night and took no body along with him except the Earl of  Pembroke  and the  Chevalier de Herbert  his Brother Coming to the Entrance of the Vault which they found not without much difficulty they soon broke the Door The noise thereof put the Countess and  her Two Waitingwomen to the utmost Consternation and tho' they were all three shut up in one of these abstruse Closets the Doors whereof were undiscoverable yet they might easily understand all what was said the Countess knowing both the King's and the Earl of  Pembroke  's voice Having narrowly search'd all the Corners of the Place they concluded she was gone from thence to another  'Why would I delay coming hither cry'd the King I had certainly met with her here where must I look for her now The Earl of  Pembroke  told him He should leave every thing to his care Perhaps said he she is gone to try whether she can get beyond Sea and when she finds she cannot she will certainly come hither again But reply'd the King when she finds the Doors broken she will not think her self safe here and will come to this place no more All shall be repair'd before Daybreak continued  Pembroke  your Majesty may confide in my care'  The King would not go away without making a second Search through the whole Vault and passing by a Looking glass fixed within the Marble he writ with his Diamond Ring the following words  Had I found her  Warwick  should have seen her no more  And seeing his stay would be useless in that place he went away sorely vex'd to see himself thus disappointed in an attempt of this nature The poor Countess was under no small Disturbance what resolution to take she found the King was gone but heard the Earl of  Pembroke  's voice who said to one that was with him  So soon as Day appears you must fetch some Workmen to have the Doors mended for my part I will stay here till I have placed all my Spies in  their proper Stations  The Countess of  Devonshire  seeing that if the Marquess of  Montague  should come thither she should be found out by the Earl's Spies or that if he should meet the Earl of  Pembroke  there they would come to the utmost Extremities took a resolution proceeding partly from Despair partly from her natural Courage this was to sally forth with her two Waitingwomen with Swords drawn and Pistols in hand to open their way if the Earl of  Pembroke  should offer to stop them They no sooner appear'd but  Pembroke  and his Brother seeing their Swords glister and not knowing who they were advanced fiercely against the Countess but she being careless of her life threw her self so furiously upon the Earl that she put his Life in danger She wounded him with her Sword and was going to second the blow had she not perceived that he began to retreat without offering to fight any longer In effect he then knew her and his Passion triumphing over all his other Resolutions he would not fight nor stop her and when the  Chevalier Herbert  drew near to revenge his Brother's Quarrel he held him by the Arm Thus the fair Countess opening her self a passage through her Enemies left her Subterraneous dwelling place and went to another where she was assured of the Fidelity of her Friends  'Twas next to an Impossibility the Earl of  Pembroke  should be Wounded and the thing not be soon known at Court The King being inform'd of all that pass'd by the  Chevalier Herbert  was vex'd to the Soul to have miss'd of the Place where the Countess of  Devonshire  lay concealed and he could not forbear to be dissatisfy'd with the Earl of  Pembroke  and his Brother because they did detain him no longer On the other hand Madam  Gray  was disturbed by a  thousand suspicious thoughts on the King's account which she found very hard to be convinced of tho' she knew that the young Countess had still a considerable place in his heart yet when she considered the Earl of  Pembroke  's Passion for her this served to check the motion she had conceived of the King's being concern'd in this Nocturnal Adventure There was not a word said at Court of the King no more than of the Countess of  Devonshire  the whole News run upon a Rencounter betwixt some Men so that the matter seem'd plain enough to every body but to her who notwithstanding all these probable Appearances could not get it out of her thoughts but that this Adventure concern'd chiefly the King and the Countess The Marquess of  Montague  was in a worse condition than all the rest he came to see his dear Countess but found her not What an Agony was he in when he saw a long tract of Blood some of the Moveables and the Doors broken to pieces He could think no otherwise than that she had been carry'd away by force he accused all the World with it sometimes the King or  Pembroke  sometimes the Countess's Enemies his pain was unspeakable till he understood that the Earl of  Pembroke  had been Wounded After all this piece of News gave occasion to more Reflections He that had Wounded him must needs be the same person that came thither to persecute the Countess and considering that he would be foolhardy enough to venture upon such an Attempt were it only in regard of the Earl of  Warwick  the more he thought of the matter the more he was confirm'd in his opinion that the King was at the head of the Party but what means was there to unfold this Riddle it being uncertain whether my Lady  Devonshire  was at liberty or not  The King needed to have acted with much more circumspection than actually he did in an Affair of so peculiar a nature to keep it from the knowledge of Madam  Gray  who had many Creatures of her own who made their Court to her at the expence of King  Edward  She would lose no time to be further satisfy'd in the matter but taking a Chair attended by a few only went to the Place where she found the Doors broke open and entring with much precipitation found the Marquess of  Montague  there still busied in searching every corner of the place They were equally surprized to meet one another here for the Aversion that was betwixt Madam  Gray  and the Earl of  Warwick  having engaged the Marquess to adhere to his Brother's Interest he never came to visit her However the high Extraction of  Jaqueline  of  Lunenburgh  her Mother and her Personal Vertues as they challenged respect from every Body so the Marquess fearing he might disturb her was going to withdraw when she desired him to stay  'You may easily guess my Lord said she there were certain strong motives that brought me hither 'tis possible you may if you please satisfie me at once in what I desire to know The whole question I have to ask is Whether the Countess of  Devonshire  has been here Yes Madam return'd the Marquess 'tis most certain that she was here Oh cry'd she I need doubt no more of what I suspected before The King is unfaithful'  She had scarce spoken these words but happening to cast her eyes upon the LookingGlass where the King had written the following Line  Had I found her  Warwick  should have seen her no more  she knew the Character to be the King's At the same time it fell into her thoughts that the King had written these  words only to amuse the Curious and to make them believe his design had miscarry'd which served only to perswade her that the Countess was in his power  I have seen enough  said she  to set my heart at rest I came  added she  to Court with much reluctancy and I shall leave it without pain My Curiosity is satisfy'd my Lord I wish yours were so too  Having spoken these words she went out of this Subterraneous Vault leav  ng the Marquess in the greatest confusion of thoughts that could be For there being no room to doubt but that it was the King who had forced open the Doors he saw no hopes how the Countess could escape his Violences So that let him look upon the thing from what side he would he found nothing but what furnish'd him with sufficient matter of Affliction even beyond what can be imagined My Lady  Devonshire  was not so little concern'd for his satisfaction as to suffer him to remain under these dreadful Apprehensions but whom could she trust upon so nice a point and not doubting but that she was betray'd before she dreaded the same Fate a second time  As for Madam  Gray  she having taken a resolution not to dispute the matter any further with the King but to avoid seeing him order'd her Chair to turn straightways towards her Seat of  Graston  with a resolution not to come near the Court a place she look'd upon now as too dangerous for the Enjoyment of her Repose The King coming to her Lodging was surprized to find her to be gone abroad but his surprize was much greater when within a few hours after he was told she was met upon the Road making all the haste she could from  London  His Passion for the Countess of  Devonshire  at that time was forced to give way to that for the fair Widow He sent for the Earl  Rivers  her Brother  'You  may serve me better upon this occasion than any other person  said he to him  very obligingly because you being in love your self are best able to judge what inquietudes I labour under on account of the departure of Madam  Gray  I know not any reason she  thus to leave me Go Earl go find her out bring her back and rest assured that if you do me this good Office I will give my Consent to what I  refused you Oh Sir  cry'd the Earl  Rivers  throwing himself at his feet  is it possible your Majesty will give me permission to marry my dear  Leonore  I dare scarce flatter my self so far but Sir don't lessen the honour I shall have of obeying you by a Reward to it I shall think my self happy enough if I can only Go immediately  continued the King  assure her of the entire possession of my heart and that I am extreamly sensible of the indifferency she shews for me  The Earl  Rivers  transported with Joy at the King's promise in favour of his beloved  Leonore  who outlived the Poyson she had taken mounted on Horseback immediately and coming near to a spacious Wood he saw in an adjacent Valley a good number of Horsemen riding so hard that tho' he follow'd them at full speed he could not possibly overtake them but coming to Madam  Gray  's was soon inform'd 'twas the King who thought he ought not to entrust any body but himself to perswade his Mistress to return And to speak the truth he was endued with all the qualifications requisite to engage a heart His Wit was not inferiour to his Person He never spoke but what was attended with some peculiar Graces and being both exceeding fair and sprightly he far surpass'd all the rest at Court except it were the Earl of  Warwick  who had some advantages above him He  reproach'd Madam  Gray  but with a thousand tender Expressions  Can you imagine  said he to her I  will break my word with you after  I  have made such a step of sending away the Earl of  Warwick  under no less pretence than to treat of a Marriage betwixt the Princess of  Savoy  and me Frun the hazard of disobliging King  Lewis XI  who being daily sollicited by  Henry  and  Margaret  of  Anjou  to assist them with some Troops in order to make War against me will doubtless soon hearken to their Proposals after I have given him such an essential Cause of Complaint as this will prove Notwithstanding all this tho'  I  foresee the Consequences nothing touches me but the satisfaction of seeing you in my Possession and at that very Jancture I am preparing for that happy day you leave me Madam and that without any cause  I  will not Sir  reply'd she  justifie my Conduct either by Tears or a deep Melancholy Your Majesty has made me hope for an Honour I thought so far above me that  I  never would give my self leave to desire it looking upon it as a thing impossible But at last when  I  saw the Earl of  Warwick  sent out of the way  I  began to be more credulous and should perhaps be in the same error still were  I  not certain that your Majesty continues to be in love with the Countess of  Devonshire  'Tis her you would snatch away from the Earl of  Warwick  and not me Sir whom you intend to place on the Throne  I  judged that upon so weighty an occasion  I  could do nothing more becoming the respect  I  owe you and that Vertue  I  always profess'd than to retreat to my Solitude and there to lead if possible an agreeable and easie Life without either pleasure or pain  The King's Passion acquired new strength by the seeming reluctancy of the fair Widow She was a Lady of a great share of Wit Gracefulness  and Conduct she knew the weak side of  Edward  and being resolved to make her Lover her Spouse she carry'd the Point so far as to make him abjure the Countess of  Devonshire  Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  and all the rest he ever had any Passion for This done he brought her back triumphantly to  London  and publickly declared his intention of marrying her  Whatever had been told to the Dutchess of  York  the King's Mother upon this head had made but very little impression upon her and this made her look upon it as so odd a piece of News when she first heard it that she was resolved to be satisfied in it from the King's own mouth when the King told her His resolution was fix'd and that nothing in the world should alter it the Dutchess could not forbear bursting out into Tears and into sharp expressions As she was a very tender Mother she foresaw with grief the ill consequences of so unequal a Match and especially in what a heinous manner the King of  France  would resent the affront put upon his Sister in law▪ Who was it Sir said she  Who could perswade you to such an action as the Earl of  Warwick  is now upon by your Order I had a mind to send him out of the way  reply'd the King  and unless I did bestow an honourable Commission upon him he would always have found som pretence or other to plague me here  The Dutchess lifted up her eyes to Heaven like a person afflicted in the most sensible part of her Soul  The King was no sooner gone but she sent word to Mrs  Elizabeth Lucy  to thwart the Match with all her Power assuring her of her Protection This young Lady being descended from an Illustrious House the King fell in Love with her whilst he was as yet Earl of  March  and as nothing could be more dreadful to her than the loss of a Prince who was so dear to her she went to the Bishop of  London  to intreat him not to marry  Edward  because he had promised to marry her and the Dutchess of  York  having notice thereof declared that her Son could not in point of Conscience marry Madam  Groy  But the King dissatisfy'd with Mrs  Lucy  challenged her to make good her words and she at last either out of respect to the King or because it was really so confess'd she had loved that Prince without any prospect of being his Queen But added she as she was throwing her self at his feet and bathing them with her Tears  If my passion for your Glory Sir did check me from wishing for any thing that might sully its lustre at this time now you are become so regardless of it your self as to intend to marry Madam  Gray  will you not permit me to ask you to be preferr'd to her I am inferiour to her in nothing she is the Widow of a private Gentleman upon whom her Heart had been bestow d before so that your Majesty will have it at second hand but as to my own I gave it you without any other consideration than because I loved you You are the only person who has been Master of all my tenderness take pity Sir of a young Woman whom you are going to render the most unfortunate person in the World I request no more of you than not to suffer me to see my Rival upon the Throne if you will place the Princess of  Savoy  there I will submit to my Destiny without murmuring  The King heard her without interrupting her and then fetching a deep sigh  'I am not of an ungrateful Temper my dear  Betty said he  I will preserve an esteem for you as long as I live and will give you most solid Proofs of it  but nothing in the world is able to alter the resolution I have taken of espousing Madam  Gray  '  'Well let us say no more of it then cry'd Mrs  Lucy  you will never see me again Sir I bid you farewell for ever'  She had no sooner said these Words but she went away and retired into a Nunnery there to conceal herself under a Religious Habit Just as she was alighting out of her Chair she was not a little surprized to see my Lord  Stanley  who offer'd his Hand to her he being just then coming back from visiting his Sister the Countess of  Devonshire  who pursuant to her Mother the Countess of  Anglesey's  Command was gone into the same Nunnery My Lord had no sooner seen Mrs  Lucy's  Livery but he went out to meet her  'Well Madam  said he  are you to be our Queen no body in the World deserves it better than yourself Oh my Lord  cry'd she  I am quire inconsolable the King is become ungrateful to me I am resolved to keep myself concealed from the World for the remainder of my Life and come here to find a safe retreat'  'Before you enter into the Nunnery  said he  I beg a moment or two to discourse with you'  so going into a spacious Diningroom where there was no other Company near them  'The Passion I have for you  said he  has render'd me hitherto the most unfortunate of all Men living Knowing the King's Sentiments for you and yours for him I had nothing else to do but to suffer and say nothing but loved you nevertheless Madam pray remember the Danger I exposed my self to to preserve your Life when one day being a Hunting a terrible Stag after having made several Persons Victims of his Fury was making directly at  you I should scarce have given myself the trouble to save  Edward's  Mistress had it not been my own particular Concern 'Twas in vain for me to consider you were under strict Engagements with him and upon that score to call all my Reason to my Aid my Heart would always let you triumph over it and without your Knowledge I have often pleaded in your behalf against myself At this time now the Scene is quite altered and that you are resolved to bury yourself in this House only out of Spite and Chagrin methinks I may make you sensible of the Danger into which you are going to precipitate yourself for to live at ones ease in a Retirement we ought to have other Motives to bring us hither than what proceeds from Spleen and Anger as soon as these are over you will regret the Loss of the World you will be tired you will dislike it and you will grow Desperate I dare propose to you a much better Conveniency let us unite Madam our Destinies by an undissolvable Knot I have a high esteem for you'  Oh My Lord  cry'd she interrupting him  durst I flatter myself with such Hopes you shou'd have my Hand together with my entire Inclinations but I believe I had better pass away the remainder of my Days in a Nunnery than to run the hazard of being slighted  To be short my Lord gave her all the Promises and confirm'd them by all the Oaths he could think of and Mrs  Lucy  resolved rather to take his Word than turn Nun so she return'd to  London  and was marry'd to my Lord  Stanley  against the consent of the Earl of  Anglesey  who nevertheless soon after pardon'd his Son and took them both into his House where Mrs  Lucy  by her modest Deportment  soon blotted out the remembrance of  former Frailty for the King  The Dutchess of  York  who had flatter'd her  lf hitherto that this young Mistress might re  ve the King's Passion for her and that in the  ean time the Earl of  Warwick  might have an  pportunity of obtaining a positive Answer from  e King of  France  was highly afflicted to see his Project miscarry this made her willingly second the Petition of the Lord Mayor of  Lon  on  wherein he attended by a great Number of Persons of Quality humbly represented to the King the Inconveniencies that were likely to  ttend so unequal a Match to the great Detrimnent of his Glory But  Edward  was offended  hereat and told them  That an amiable and vir  uous Woman ought to be preferr'd to one of a higher Rank  However this engaged him to write to the Earl of  Charolois  Son of the Duke of  Burgundy  to desire him to send over into  England  some of the nearest Relations of Madam  Gray  in hopes that their appearance might imprint a Respect in the  English  for her Person according to her Demerits The Earl of  Charolois  overjoy'd to see his Marriage with the Princess of  Savoy  come to nothing which hitherto had made him not a little uneasie by reason of the Alliance to be contracted betwixt King  Lewis  XI a mortal Enemy to the House of  Burgundy  and  Edward  did not fail to send  James  of  Luxenburgh  Earl of  S Pol  and Uncle to the fair Widow attended by a great Number of great Lords and a hundred Knights most magnificently equipp'd to assist at the solemnity of the Nuptials The Fame of their Names and the richness and beauty of their Equipage served to stop the Mouths of all that had exclaim'd against the Match before so that the King  espoused Madam  Gray  in publick under the joyful Acclamations of the People who were much taken with the Sumptuous Preparations and Appearance of the Feast contrived so on purpose by the King's Orders The Earl of St  Pol  being upon his D  parture for his own Country was presented by the King with a Chain valued at three Hundred Nobles and each of the Knights of his Company with one of Fifty Nobles He desired him to assure the Earl of  Charolois  of his entire Friendship and as a token thereof made him a Knight of the Garter sending the Collar to him by the said Earl of  S Pol  and engaging his Word to send him some of his best Troops  The Earl  Rivers  was too sensibly  with the Merits and Beauty of  Leonore  to neglect this opportunity of desiring the Kings consent to Marry her  You have been pleas'd to flatter me Sir  said he  that your Majesty would not oppose my Happiness and I hope that after the Honour you have done us of placing my Sister upon the Throne I may without being presumptuous desire  favour at your Hands Were it for your advantage  reply'd the King  I should be overjoy'd  But do you consider that by marrying  Leonore  you will neither improve your Estate nor  What occasion have I for it Sir  return'd the Earl  having the Honour to be ally'd to you it seems to me I ought to look for nothing more than how to satisfie my Passion and I know no greater Satisfaction in the world than to have a Wife worthy of being beloved But all this without a good Fortune  added the King  makes us often lead but an indifferent Life for how often happens it that Love ceases and then you will find an Estate much more convenient than Love I  am too much in Love Sir  said the Earl  to ima  ne I shall ever repent of having espoused  Leo  re  on the contrary in having her I believe I  ill have every thing and without her I shall not be sensible of any Enjoyments Yes Sir I shall be always rich if she is my Wife and always poor if she be not Well then  said the King  pursue the Motions of so tender a Passion I should be unjust to disturb it at the same time when I sacrifice every thing to my own  The Earl  Rivers  transported with joy threw himself at the King's feet returning him hearty Thanks in such terms as he thought most proper to make this Monarch sensible of his Acknowledgement begging of him to obtain also the Queens consent which being done by King  Edward  's Intercession she told her Brother the next Day she should be well pleased to see his dear  Leonore  that her only aim was to render him Happy and that had he left it to her D  sposal she would have taken care to make him so but that after all she would constrain him to nothing The Earl told her That if he were Master of the Universe he should be less pleased with it than in the possession of his Mistress and that his Fortune could not he ill as long as he shared it with so amiable a Person  He now lost no time to go to Madam  Digby's  his Equipage being very Sumptuous according to the Rank he bore at Court  Leonore  who had heard nothing as yet of the King's Marriage with Madam  Gray  could not imagine from whence proceeded so great an Alteration but her surprize was much greater when he presented to her the Jewels and rich Apparel sent her by the new Queen He gave her an account of the whole Affair and told her he was come  to conjure her to abandon this melancholy Solitude to justifie his Choice at  London  The whole Family and even herself at first thought he had been Frenzical they could not comprehend immediately so surprizing a change of Fortune to see a young Country Gentlewoman born and bred in the Country at one stroak of Fortune to become SisterinLaw to the King of  England  and to be transplanted into one of the finest Courts of  Europe  However  Leonore  being a young Lady of a considerable share of natural Wit and Sense there needed no great trouble to teach her her Lesson She heartily loved the Earl  Rivers  and was very sensible of what he had done for her So he conducted her to Court where the Nuptials were celebrated with no less Magnificency than if she had been a Princess  Whilst these things were transacting at  London  where the Marquess of  Montague  did not appear at any of these publick Feasts the Earl of  Warwick  who had brought the Negotiation of the Marriage betwixt King  Edward  and  Bona  Princess of  Savoy  to a good issue in  France  had notice sent him several times by his Brothers of what pass'd at Court but would give no Credit to it For the King's Conduct in this Affair being so irregular and he having a much better opinion of his Understanding he chose rather to call in question the sincerity of his Friends who sent him the News than the King's Conduct till he was convinced of the Truth thereof by the King of  France  's own Mouth This Prince being one of the greatest Politicians in the World conceal'd his Resentment and coldly told the Earl There were certain Faults by which those that committed them were more effectually punish'd than those against whom  they were committed  Had the King your Ma  er  added he  chosen another Princess before my  ister in Law I should have shewn my Resentment  pon such an account but now the whole Questi  is concerning a private Gentlewoman who  ad been his Subject who has nothing to give him  ut to satisfie his Passion I assure you my Lord  mbassador I am very well satisfy'd Oh Sir  y'd the Earl  I beg of your Majesty not to give  e the Title of an Ambassador I will never  erve a King in that station who breaks his Word  He found that if he should go on he  hould be apt to discover too far his Resentment  y he said no more for fear the King who was  ne of the most refined Princes in the World if  e should dive into his real Sentiments should  mprove it to his own Advantage  He was no sooner come out of the Audience Chamber but the Queen sent word she desired to  peak with him He found her in Company with the Princess of  Savoy  both transported with Anger  Tell your Master  said the Queen  e shall send us the Picture of my Sister he is  nworthy both of the Original and of the Copy  The Princess looking stedfastly upon the Ambassador  You bear  said she  a share in the Affront  ut upon me as well as myself perhaps I should not have put the least Confidence in what has been proposed to me had it come from any other but the Earl of  Warwick  I should have made due reflection upon the fickle temper of the King of  England  but my Lord 'twas your Name that made me put my confidence in the Proposals made to us then remember in what manner they treat us and if you have any Power make use of it to revenge our Wrong Madam  reply'd the Earl  after this I dare promise you nothing but time will convince  you whether I know how to resent an Injury done to your Highness and myself  His impatience to return to  London  was too great and the part he had acted in  Paris  too disagreeable to stay there any longer He left that City altogether taken up with the Thoughts of what had happened in  England  to Madam  Gray  There being a mutual Aversion betwixt them he could not promise himself for the future ary considerable share in the King's Favour and the Honour he had done him in putting him upon the Negotiation of a Marriage he intended not to perform seem'd so cruel an Affront to him that he thought no Revenge beyond his Resentment He being not as yet acquainted with what had happened to my Lady  Devonshire  he hoped to find her in her subtenaneous Lodgings and if there was any thing that could allay his dissatisfaction it was the pleasure he proposed to himself of seeing again the only Person he lov'd best in the World As he came nearer to  London  he understood that the publick Rejoicings continu'd that  Anthony  Sirnamed the  Bastard  had pass'd the Sea so strongly guarded that two Privateers who pretended to take him were taken with a great Booty and the rest forced to sheer off This being one of the most brave and gallant Knights of his Age  Charles  Earl of  Charolois  highly satisfy'd with those Marks of his Friendship  Edward  had transmitted to him by the Earl of  S Pol  and judging if of the greatest Consequence to enter into a more strict Correspondence with this Monarch to withdraw him from the League proposed to him by King  Lewis  XI against the Duke of  Burgundy  his Father charged his Natural Brother with a Commission to sound King  Edward  's Inclinations concerning a Marriage with  Margaret  of  York  his  Sister He could not have entrusted so weighty  Affair into better Hands for upon his Arrival the Tournaments and other such like Exercises were renew'd The Lord  Descalles  Brother  Law to the new Queen was to engage him a Day being appointed for that purpose  The Earl of  Warwick  being inform'd of all this upon the Road went not directly to  London  but took the way to  Sionhill  with so much secrecy that even the Marquess of  Montague  knew nothing of it The Earl of  Warwick  order'd  Berincour  to get him a black Armour and to cause to be painted on his Shield an Arm extended striking a Thunderbolt at a Crown with this Inscription  Thus the Gods revenge themselves  his Plume Scarf and the Trappings of his Horse were of a light red to signifie his Anger and to make the World believe he was still upon the Road he had it given out he was fal'n ill by the way  He left  Sionhill  attended only by  Berincour  both with the Vizors of their Helmets down and as they were riding with an easie Pace towards  London  saw a Knight cross the Road whose Armour being very like the Earl's they had the Curiosity of taking particular notice of him and casting their Eyes upon his Borialer found these Words there  Never did Eyes behold so fair a Lady  This Inscription seem'd too nearly to reflect upon the Countess of  Devonshire's  Charms for the Earl of  Warwick  to let him pass by without opposition  Knight  said he to the unknown  whoever you are you give your Opinion with too much Presumption for the Lady you think so handsom and I can assure you I know one that's beyond her It seems to me as if you judged with more rashness than I  reply'd the Knight  but I am so well satisfy'd in my assertion  that I am sure you will be of the same Opinion so soon as you have seen her Picture if you can deny it after that look here  said he pointing to his Sword  this shall make you own it to be so Thy Threats don't frighten me  reply'd the Earl with a Smile  let us see this Picture and at the same time prepare for Fighting  The unknown without returning an Answer drew out a long Chain of Gold on which was fastned a magnificent Case richly set with Diamonds and in it the Picture of the Countess of  Devonshire  The Earl of  Warwick  's surprize at the sight thereof was beyond what can be imagined he fetch'd a deep lamentable sigh and for some time remained like a Man bereaved of his Senses but on a sudden recovering himself  No  said he  I don't dispute the Beauty of this Lady to be surpassing all others but I will maintain that you are unworthy of so precious a pledge of her Friendship  Having spoken these Words he was going to take a Launce  Berincour  held in his Hand whilst the unknown affronted at these Words was preparing to attack him But  Berincour  who observed every thing in cool Blood happening to know the Case wherein was the Countesses Picture because he had been employ'd in having it made did not question but that this Knight was the Marquess of  Mon+tague  Oh my Lord  said he to his Master keeping the Launce back  'tis my Lord your Brother look upon him with attention and you will know him as well as I do  The Earl of  Warwick  finding it was him beckned him with his Hand▪ that before they began the Combat he would speak to him  And why Brother  said he  shoul  we turn our Weapons against one another which ought to be employ'd against our common Enemies▪  and so he lifted up his Vizor The Marquess almost distracted at what had happened threw himself from his Horse and the Earl alighting likewise went to meet him with open Arms  And are you here my Lord  cry'd the Marquess  and would not let me know it What have I done to you Don't charge me with Indifferency  reply'd the Earl  you know how dearly I love you But understanding that there are to be certain Courses and Tournaments wherein the Queens Knights are to make their appearance I had a desire to be there  incognito  to maintain the Beauty of the Countess of  Devonshire  surpasses hers in hopes to draw the King into the Quarrel to give him a proof of the strength of my Arm I thought it not fit to bring you in for a share because I would not interrupt your Application to serve the Countess  The Marquess lifting up his Eyes to Heaven  Oh my Lord  said he  you know but one part of what occasion of Complaint  Edward  has given us  They seated themselves under some Trees where seeing themselves at full liberty to entertain one another the Marquess related to his Brother the carrying away by force of the Countess with all the Circumstances relating to this unhappy Accident  You see  continued he  this black Armour it relates to the Countess I went with the same Design as you do to break a La  nce with the King and the worthless  Pembroke  if his Wounds he received there are cured truly I expected your coming with much impatience in order to act in concert against our common Enemies for our mutual Satisfaction  Whilst the Marquess was talking the Earl had a thousand direful Projects in his Head which gave him no liberty  o speak at last recovering himself he began  o call Heaven and Earth to witness that he would revenge himself in such a manner as never  any Subject was known to have done before  Can he be thus ungrateful  cry'd he  unto whom he is bebolden for the Crown of  England  I did not only put it upon his Head but also have kept it steddy there In return whereof he puts two such Bloody Affronts upon me such as he ought not to have put upon an Enemy Let us go Brother to the Tournament if he appears in the List let's join our strength to attack him and provided we die not unrevenged never let us regret our Destiny  'No my Lord  said the Marquess  let us not run the hazard of so much odds against us we may maintain against the Queens Knights so that she cannot challenge the Prize of being the greatest Beauty and if the King appears among them we will spare him no more than the rest 'tis requisite great Designs should not be undertaken without long and most serious Considerations'  The Earl being well satisfy'd with his Brother's Advice they both mounted on Horseback and appear'd at the List just as the Queen attended by a numerous Court was placing herself in a Balcony covered with rich Tapestry and gold brocaded Stuffs whilst the Earl of  Warwick  and the Marquess of  Montague  casting their Eyes upon her found such an Emotion within themselves as they were scarce able to keep within due bounds  The Earl  Rivers  my Lord  Hastings  Duke of  Exeter  my Lord High Chamberlain my Lord  Descalles  the Queens Brother in Law  John  Earl of  Oxford John de Moubray  Duke of  Norfolk  and  Humphrey  Duke of  Buckingham  had taken their Stations along the Barriers expecting the coming of the Bastard of  Burgundy  with his young Nobility But whilst they stay'd for their  Company the Earl of  Warwick  and his Brother sent a Herauld to bid defiance to my Lord  Descalles  and the Earl  Rivers  offering they were ready to maintain that the Queens Beauty and all the Ladies at Court was not comparable to that of the Lady they serv'd So disobliging a Defiance surprized the Herald no less than all the Knights I mention'd before and the News thereof being soon brought to the King and Queen they blush'd for spite saying  'They must be very impolite Persons who would affront so many Ladies'  However the right of freedom being inviolable especially at such like publick Feasts it was not judged proper to make use of any violent means against these Knights besides that there appeared a certain Grandeur in all their Actions as caused a Respect in all those that beheld them The Queen order'd the Earl  Rivers  to be call'd  'Brother  said shewith a great deal of Modesty  were I alone concern'd in this Defiance I would not advise you to espouse so bad a Cause but your own Wife and so many other fair and charming Persons having their share in the Challenge you ought to undertake it with Resolution and Courage as for the Conditions I leave them to your own Discretion'  'Madam  said the King interrupting her  No body is better able to do it than myself I will espouse the Quarrel of that Beauty I adore the Earl  Rivers  shall be my second'  'No Sir  cry'd the Queen endeavouring to keep him back  I beg of you by all that is good to remain only a Spectator and let it fall out as it will I shall be well satisfied with the Honour your Majesty intended to do me'  The King had not patience enough to mind what she said but taking his Armourentred  the List So soon as he appear'd the Barriers were opened under the Sound of Trumpets and other Warlike Instruments which resounded from all Parts and the King having not as yet mounted his Horse the Earl of  Warwick  and the Marquess of  Montague  alighted from their Horses likewise and drawing nearer  'Knights  said the King  you come to my Court to maintain the Beauty of an unknown Lady against that of the Queen and her Ladies 'Tis possible that either out of Complaisance or to do the Lady Justice the point might be granted you if one could see her but who is able to decide it'  'You yourself Sir  said the Earl of  Warwick  casting such  oks at him as were more piercing than Lightning itself  I am apt to believe you have not forgot her and then shew'd him the Countess of  Devonshire's  Pi+cture The King was so surprized and cha  d at the sight thereof that he remain'd doub  for some time whether he should continue to defend the Queens Beauty or join with the Knights on the Countesses side Sometimes he look'd upon the Picture sometimes upon  two unknown and considering the whole he could not but guess the Earl of  Warwick  to have a hand in the Game so bold an Action as this could not be well attributed to any other Person but himself  'I doubt  said he  whether the Lady whose Picture you shew would own you for her Knights if she know what use you made of it she bears too much Respect to the Queen and is too polite a Person to insult her and all other Ladies Beauty I have said nothing in her Name Sir  reply'd the Earl fier  ly  but I come to ask whether you will declare against her I should be very vnwilling to do so were it upon any other Occasion but this  said the King  but as the Case stands I am resolved I will prepare for your Defence we will break each of us three Launces and he that gets the Honour of the Combat shall carry off the Picture of the vanquish'd Lady This is not sufficient for us Sir  reply'd the Earl of Warwick  we must carry off more than one Picture to the Lady whose Knights we are and therefore humbly desire your Majesty that all those that appear in Arms there at the Barriers may enagage against us if they are vanquish'd they are to give us the Pictures of their Ladies if we are we will give them that of ours'  The King beckned them to draw near being unwilling to answer for them before he had spoke to them but they were all ready to accept the offer Every one had a Picture about him some of their Wives some of their Mistresses The King was the first who put the Queens Picture upon a Triumphal Arch erected in one of the Corners of the Barrier The Earl  Rivers  also set up that of his  Leonore Digby  and all the rest produced their Pictures in golden Cases  The first Tryal of Skill was made betwixt the King and the Earl of  Warwick  and betwixt the Marquess of  Montague  and the Earl  Rivers  under a thousand joyful Acclamations of the Spectators who were surprized at the goodly Mien and the Skill those four Combatants shew'd on Horseback But it was not long before the Scene was altered for in spite of all the King's Dexterity the Earl of  Warwick  animated with Revenge soon got the better of him  The Queen and all her Ladies could not see this ill Success but with the utmost Dissatisfaction and had it been in their Power to play an ill Game they would perhaps not have been spaing  in it at this Juncture To be short the Earl and his Brother gained all the honour of the Combat but would not take the Queen's Picture which by most was supposed to be done out of respect without considering it might be out of an Aversion to her person As for her own part she knew very well the reason of it she had discovered her particular Enemy in the person of the Kninht with the Black Armour and the Device painted on his Shield served her for an Interpreter of his Actions The King and the Earl  Rivers  went out of the List much vex'd at their ill Success tho' the rest who engaged with the Earl of  Warwick  and the Marquess of  Montague  met with no better fortune  They lost every one his Picture but the Victorious Knights would not take all the advantage they might have done they return'd to the Knights their Pictures without so much as opening the Cases to look upon them except those belonging to the Duke of  Exeter  and the Earl of  Oxford  their Brothersinlaw whose Pictures they carry'd away In the mean time the Bastard of  Burgundy  being advanced to the Barriers had been a Spectator of the Dexterity of the two brave unknown to his great admiration this made him ask permission of the Princess of  York  to maintain her Beauty against them but she refused to consent to it finding by what she had seen already that her Picture would meet with the same Fate as all the rest had done She told him with a great deal of modesty She was not ambitious and desired him to remember that he being her Knight was to engage with my Lord  Descalles  These few words being received by the  Burgundian  with the utmost respect he broke several Launces in honour of the Princess and his Knights shew'd their utmost Dexterity  against the  English  but nothing was per  rm'd on either side that could come in compe  tion with the Atchievements of the Earl of  Warwick  He had taken the first Opportunity to get away with his Brother with so much diligence that the King had no time to send some body to follow them and the Queen was in so ill an humour that under pretence of finding her self not very well she left the Company to give vent to her spite and rage It being not long before the King came to see her  Oh Sir  said she  you need not doubt but that that Presumptuous Person who engaged with you was the Earl of  Warwick I  know him better by his design of affronting me than by his Air and Device Madam  reply'd the King  he is disgusted at his late Journey into  France  and 'tis possible if he had those who would second him he would endeavour to cause me some trouble but  Henry  's Party is reduced to so low an Ebb that it is almost doubtful now whether there ever were such a thing as the House of  Lancaster  in the World  The Earl of  Warwick  and his Brother went back to  Sion hill  from whence they first dispatch'd  Berincour  to old  Albine  to find out and talk with her in private For as she still lived with the Countess of  Anglesey  so he hoped by her means to hear some News of the Countess of  Devonshire  So soon as he was gone the Earl and the Marquess opened the two PictureCases they had carry'd off as Victors great was their surprize when they found the Countess of  Devonshire  's Picture in that of the Earl of  Oxford  's  I must needs own to you  said the Earl shewing the Picture to the Marquess of  Montague that I did not approve of my Sisters  Jealousie against her Husband but now find she was not in the wrong How is it possible my Lady  Devonshire  should have so much regard to the Earl of  Oxford  as to bestow such a Pledge upon him How unfortunate am I  answered the Marquess of  Montague I will do her more justice than you Questionless the Earl of  Oxford  has got this Picture without her knowledge in the same manner as I obtained mine which was likely to have occasioned a Duel betwixt us Oh Brother what comfort you give me I must now confess to you that never any thing went more near me than the sight of her Picture in your hands I would not be inquisitive for fear of discomposing you by my Curiosity but I can't forbear to tell you I have been very jealous upon that account Alas My Lord what need you fear  reply'd the Marquess with a melancholy Air  don't you know you are beloved  He said no more but remained very pensive  Do you look upon my present Condition  said the Earl  as to be envy'd by any don't you know what treatment I meet with All my hopes are vanish'd by my having fought and kill'd her Husband Had he kill'd me I had been much happier than I am now for there is no torment comparable to mine  The Marquess lifted up his Eyes towards Heaven as if he would say He had more cause of Complaint than he After a few moments silence the Earl ask'd the Marquess's advice  How he had best to carry on matters at Court I advise you  said he to him  to make your Appearance there to remove all manner of suspicion which will enable you the better to take your own measures I shall regulate my Conduct  reply'd my Lord  Warwick in a great measure according to what News I shall receive of your dear Countess and therefore will stay  two days longer at  Sionhill  before I go to  London which the Marquess approved of  He expected with the utmost impatience the return of  Berincour  when he happened to come back and delivered to him a Letter from my Lady  Devonshire  He received it with an unexpressible satisfaction and opening it read the following words  I value your Esteem at too high a rate to hazard the loss of it by a silence which might make you imagine that the King has carry'd me away and that I am in his hands You will understand what it was that saved me by the same person who is intrusted to give you an account of my present condition she is to desire you from me not to think of seeing me any more it being absolutely requisite it should be so for my Glory and Repose  The Earl of  Warwick  gave the Billet to the Marquess to peruse it who told him  I must confess to you my Lord I was in a most terrible fear since almost nothing less than a miracle could secure the Countess from the danger she was in Relate to us the Particulars  continued the Marquess addressing himself to  Berincour My Lord  said the Gentleman  I saw  Albine  she made at first a thousand difficulties to speak with any freedom concerning the Countess of  Devonshire  but knowing her Mercenary Temper I  her that I had a very fine Ring made for her on purpose in  France  which I intended to present her with This revived her former Confidence Could I suppose  said she to him  you would marry me and that this Ring was to be the Pledge of your Faith I would accept it with pleasure but I am sure you have been so taken up with your  Master's Business that you have thought but little of me and when I see my self thus used I have no more to say to you I promised every thing she would have me to do  continued  Berincour and understood that my Lady  Devonshire  was in one of the most abstruse Closets in the Vault when the King and the Earl of  Pembroke  came thither They put her into a most terrible fright whilst they were searching for her till the King being gone and the Earl of  Pembroke  staying behind she moved by Despair unexpectedly sallied out in her Man's habit and with Sword and Pistol in hand having opened her self a passage went to an old Friend of their Family There reflecting upon the danger she had so lately escaped she took a Resolution of seeing her Brother and by his means  endeavour to find a safe Refuge in her own Family  My Lord  Stanley  dearly loved his Sister and had been much concern'd at her misfortune and if the Earl and Countess of  Anglesey  should continue in their Anger against their Daughter they must needs expect to see her exposed to most hazardous Accidents My Lord  Stanley  knew how to represent this Point to them in such tender and pressing terms that at last they agreed to receive and protect her against all her Enemies provided she would for the future follow their advice never see the Earl of  Warwick  again and retire into a Religious House as long as they should think convenient My Lord  Stanley  was so desirous to see his Sister at rest that he accepted of all the Conditions imposed upon her by the Countess of  Anglesey  And the Countess of  Devonshire  willing to comply with them threw her self at her Mother's feet and regain'd that tenderness which she had lost by her misfortunes She is continued  Albine  in an Abbey where I can't let  you see her but I will speak to her to morrow concerning the Earl of  Warwick  Accordingly she brought me the Billet to my Lord I just now delivered to you and told me that my Lady  Devonshire  conjures you not to take the least step in order to come near her there being nothing in the World more opposite to her intention Well then  cry'd the Earl interrupting  Berincour    the Countess had at last the good fortune to escape the King's and his worthless Favourites hands I bebegin to breath a little for I must own to you Brother I was very ingenious in tormenting my self A secret Jealousie I was not able to master did gnaw my heart and cast me into an Abyss of Melancholy thoughts My sufferings are beyond yours my Lord  reply'd the Marquess  for I was so dextrous in fancying something so cruel in this Adventure as rendred me quite inconsolaable  The Earl return'd no answer to his Brother but after a few minutes Silence it was agreed betwixt them that they would go to Court the next day  The Earl of  Warwick  was not a little put to it to conceal his Resentment from the King by him he was received with much coldness For the Queen vex'd to the heart at what had happened at the Tournament and not questioning but that these two unknown were the Earl of  Warwick  and the Marquess of  Montague  had been continually exasperating the King against them  'Twas done Sir said she to him in defyance to you and to expose your Choice when they set up the Beauty of the Countess of  Devonshire  against me The King most tenderly lo+ved the Queen and was not well pleased with the Earl of  Warwick  's having got so much the better of him at the Tournament so that instead of endeavouring a favourable Reception to make  him forget the affront he had put upon him in preferring  Isabella Woodville  to the Princess of  Savoy  that the furnish'd fresh matter of Complaint to the Earl who now took a resolution to revenge himself by the utter destruction of the same Monrach he had placed on the Throne The better to encompass this design he entred into a strict Friendship with the Duke of  Clarence  one of the King's Brothers who marry'd one of his Daughters who was very young but the richest Heiress in  England  The Marriage was consummated at  Calais  whilst the Archbishop of  York  and the Marquess of  Montague  did their utmost efforts to strengthen their Party in  England  The Earl of  Warwick  after his return from  Calais  raised a good Army directing his March straight to  London  with a design to Depose  Edward  and place  Henry  on the Throne again  Edward  was not a little surprized at this unexpected News for tho' he was one of the b  +vest Princes in the World he was apt to indulge himself too much in the enjoyment of his Pleasures trusting to his good Fortune which hitherto had made him Triumph over all his Enemies But now finding the danger at hand he ordered the Earl of  Pembroke  to draw together with all possible speed what Troops he could and to march against the rebels The Earl was very well pleased with this Commission for he could not forgive the Earl of  Warwick  to have a better share in the Countess of  Devonshire  's heart than himself he made  Richard Herbert  his Brother General under him and when the Earl of  Warwick  understood he was to fight against them this serv'd only to augment his Hatred and Emulation a thousand brave Actions pass'd betwixt them recorded in History till at last  a Battel was fought near  Bambridge  wherein the Earl of  Warwick  's Forces were upon the point of turning their backs when  John Clapam  an old brave Souldier and faithful Servant to that Family putting himself at the head of or  Northampton  Men carrying a white Bear being the Earl's Arms in their Banners returning to the Charge with a loud Huzza crying Long live  Warwick  put the King's Army into such a Consternation that they betook themselves to flight The Earl of  Pembroke  and his Brother unwilling to survive this Disgrace fought it out to the last Man and were both taken Prisoners by the Victorious Enemy The same misfortune attended the Earl  Rivers  The Countess  Rivers  who had an infinite deal both of tenderness and and acknowledgment for him could not be at ease all the time of his absence dreading the various Chances of War but when she heard he was taken Prisoner she was upon the point of running distracted King  Edward  had used his Prisoners so rigorously and the Execution of  Henry  Duke of  Somerset  was as yet in so fresh a remembrance that she did not question but that her Husband would be sacrificed to what they call  Reason of State  and to the Personal Aversion betwixt the Queen and the Earl she could think of no better expedient to shelter her self against this impending Storm than to have recourse to the Authority of the Countess of  Devonshire  She went to her in the Nunnery where she then was  'Alas Madam said she to her you see here before you the unfortunate  Leonore  who is come to implore your Compassion in behalf of the Earl  Rivers  He is in the hands of the Earl of  Warwick  and 'tis fear'd he will accept of no Ransome for his Prisoners Judge what a condition I am  in I conjure you to use your Intercession for the preservation of a person who is guilty of no other Crime than of having served his King and being the Queen's Brother Secure his Life against that dreadful stroke that threatens it and in asking you his I ask you my own Life Madam won't you make use of your Interest Have you forgot that had it not been for me  Jamy  had been sacrificed to the jealousie of that ill favoured  Digby  I am sensible Madam reply'd the Countess how much I am indebted to you and embracing her tenderly you need not said she urge such motives of Gratitude to engage me to do all that is in my power Let us not lose one moment Madam for in such like cases every minute is precious'  She then writ a Letter to the Earl of  Warwick  the most engaging she ever sent to him and giving it to the Countess of  Rivers  advised her not to lose one moment  The Countess sent the swiftest Courier she could find out but by the highest of misfortune he arrived at that very moment when the Earl's Head was just lopp'd off My Lady  Devonshire  's Request having the force of an irresistible Command with the Earl of  Warwick  he run straight to the Tent where this Illustrious Prisoner was kept under a Guard  'You are obliged for every thing my Lord to the Countess of  Devonshire  said the Earl as he was just upon entring the Tent she orders me to give you your Liberty enjoy the good Fortune she has bestow'd upon you'  The Earl not appearing and those that heard him speak fearing they had been too hasty in his Execution no body durst say one word but they judged by their silence that it was too late He was grieved to the heart this being the only favour the Countess of  Devonshire  ever ask'd him and which was in his power to grant lifting up his eyes towards Heaven  'How unfortunate am I cry'd he All the unhappy Accidents centre in me O Barbarous Laws of an irreconcilable War which makes us forget the very Notions of Humanity what excess don't you constrain me to commit'  His heart being full of affliction he writ a Letter to the Countess of  Devonshire  in his justification in not having been able to obey her Commands  In the mean while the Countess  Rivers  impatient to see her dear Spouse follow'd the Express as fast as she could when she met him upon the Road coming back like a Man struck dumb with consternation neither had she any great occasion to ask him concerning the fatal Catastrophe of her Husband a certain Heartach with a thousand other Melancholy thoughts foretold her what she feared to hear she made such doleful cries and lamentations as would have touch'd the very Rocks that were near her she talk'd of nothing but of precipitating her self from the top to the bottom and those that attended her had much ado to divert her from that Resolution  'Why should you said she hinder me from following him who loved me to so high a degree and whom I loved so dearly He would not live without me and should I be so ungrateful as to live without him And if I would alas is it in my power so to do'  Her Attendants took care to carry her to an Abbey at no great distance from the place where they then were which she would never leave afterwards looking upon this as the most proper place that might afford her the doleful consolation of bewailing what she had so tenderly loved for the remainder of her life  The Earl of  Pembroke  and his Brother  Richard Herbert  both the Earl of  Warwick  's Prisoners being also condemned by him to lose their Heads the Earl of  Pembroke  desired to speak with him  ''Tis not said he to him to ask you my life I wanted to see you I should be vex'd to owe you so great an Obligation and thereby to diminish in the least the hatred I bear you but my Lord what is it my Brother had done Has he been the cause of our being Rivals His Youth his Courage his Birth every thing intercedes with you in his behalf Am not I a Victim sufficient to allay your revenge I shall have nothing to reproach to you as you will not have any thing to reproach to me and thus far we shall be even with one another The condition you are reduced to my Lord reply'd the Earl of  Warwick  would soon engage me to forget your treacherous dealings with me were my own particular Interest concern'd only but I can't pardon you without acting contrary to the Laws of this War Had I faln into your hands you would certainly have treated me as I am going now to treat you Yes my Lord reply'd the Earl of  Pembroke  fiercely I should have taken all possible care to rid my hands of you But pray examine without partiality your case and mine you were always my Rival you were always beloved whereas I always met with an ill treatment alas what sufferings have I not undergone upon that account You are the only cause of them whereas you can have no other reason on your side than the eagerness you have of sacrificing an unfortunate person who cherish'd the same thing that you did but in taking away my Life you do me a kindness against your own will 'Tis so long ago since it is become odious to  me that I desire nothing else than death and I desire you to order them to dispatch with all speed But the case is quite different with my Brother Alas what has he committed against you He served his King his Benefactor without knowing any thing of our Personal Quarrel and my Sentiments for the Countess Would not you have fought under the same Banners had not you a particular cause of complaint against  Edward  And did not you place him on the same Throne from whence you now intend to pull him again My Lord said the Earl of  Warwick  interrupting him upon this occasion my private Animosity has not the least share in what I am going about to do but 'tis reason of State that forbids me to grant your Request I must be forced to leave you for I find it impossible to resist any longer your Intreaties'  So away he went fearing lest compassion should so far prevail upon him as to prevent him from Sacrificing to the Countess of  Devonshire  a person who endeavoured her Ruin  Thus the brave Earl of  Pembroke  and his Brother finish'd their days King  Edward  was more afflicted thereat than at the loss of the Battel  'Alas said he my Friendship always proves fatal to my faithful Subjects who can supply the place these two brave Men held in my Affection'  King  Edward  highly sensible of his late Disgrace gathered the scattered remnants of his Troops unto which he join'd some new Levies but notwithstanding this finding himself too weak to cope with his Enemy he proposed an Accommodation and living in hopes of a good issue little care was taken in his Camp to keep the Souldiers to their Duty The Earl advertised thereof took the advantage of a dark Night  kill'd all he found in Arms and seeing himself soon Master of the Camp advanced directly to the King's Tent and found him fast asleep I give you leave to guess at this Monarch's Surprize when by the Light of the Flambeaux he saw the Earl of  Warwick  compleatly arm'd with his Sword drawn who threw open his Curtains with a bold Countenance and with Eyes sparkling with fire and anger The King soon perceiving it was too late to make any Resistance  'You are Victorious said he to him with a firm and steady look I am your Prisoner but hope my Lord you will make no ill use of your good Fortune I know what Respect I owe you Sir reply'd the Earl modestly would to God your Majesty had also known what you ow'd to such a Servant as I was Earl my misfortunes are too grievous said the King don't upbraid me you have no real cause of Complaint against me unless it be on account of my Marriage and I think no Man in the Universe ought to be a better Judge of the Power of a Love passion than your self But to convince you what a good opinion I still have of you I conjure you that if the Queen happens to fall into your hands you will treat her according to her Rank and Virtue Sir reply'd the Earl the high Station unto which your Majesty has exalted her and her Sex are such strict Engagements to me as she shall never want my Respect'  Edward  fetch'd a deep sigh said not a word more and with a profound melancholy in his face follow'd his Conqueror who confined him in the Castle of  Warwick  but upon further consideration not thinking him sufficiently secured there he desired the Archbishop of  York  to receive and keep him in the Castle  of  Medelan  and so he made all the haste he could to  London  His whole Heart and Mind being always with the Countess of  Devonshire  and knowing the Nunnery she had chosen for her Retirement he went thither to ask for her There had been so great a Change of Affairs since she saw him last that she judged she ought not to refuse him an Interview  I appear here before you Madam  said he  notwithstanding your Orders to the contrary but it was absolutely necessary I should consult you upon the Destiny of two Great Kings as also upon yours and mine You will easily believe Madam I was never ambitious of the  English  Crown because when it was in my power to put it upon my own head I gave it to  Edward  But it being now once more at my disposal I could not resist the satisfaction of making an Offer of it to you I am come therefore to lay the Crown of  England  at your feet If you will allow me to aid you in ascending the Throne and will afford me a Place there I shall think my self a thousand times more indebted to you than you can be to me  Henry  is still in the Tower  Edward  in the Castle of  Medelan  and I am a much closer Prisoner than these two Princes Consider with attention of what I propose to you time is precious you may render me happy without fearing the least opposition  'My Lord  said the Countess  I need not consider long of the Answer I am to give you concerning the offer you make me 'Tis not the Lustre of a Crown that cou'd entice me I never thought you would have been in a condition to give it but to do all the Justice I can to your Merit my Lord I will not enlarge any farther upon that Subject for fear of discovering to you the utmost extent of my  Misfortunes when I am forced by my Duty and out of Decency to refuse a Spouse who would be the only Happiness of my Life Oh Madam  cry'd the Earl fetching a deep Sigh  don't sweeten by such obliging Expressions the bitterness of your cruel refusal you would find out Reasons enough to persuade you to give me your Hand were not mine odious to you and so you will rather refuse the Kingdom I offer than reign along with me After all this Madam I have nothing else to do but to think of dying I will be as forward in courting all opportunities to lose my Life as I would have been careful to avoid them had your Sentiments proved more favourable to me'  'Go on my Lord make sure Work to overwhelm me with Reproaches  reply'd the Countess  call my Words in question doubt since you force me to tell it doubt of the Possession of my Heart doubt whether I love you beyond any thing living'  'Alas  answered the Earl interrupting her  how shall I be convinced of it you have so much goodness as not to dispatch me at once you reserve me for a languishing Martyrdom but I am not able to resist long the Torments of your Refusal I shall certainly pay for them with my Life'  Their whole Conversation run upon Prayers and Reproaches assurances of Friendship and Justifications At last they parted equally overcharg'd with Grief the Countess being seiz'd with the most violent Inquietude that could be for her dear Earl the Part he was to act was of such vast Consequence as was likely to expose him to so many Dangers that the fair Lady could not but be greatly allarm'd thereat  The Earl of  Warwick  now despairing of success in persuading Madam  Devonshire  to accept of the Crown at his Hands and being not inclin'd to wear it himself except for her sake he directed his Journey to  London  with an intention to have  Henry  out of the  Tower  where he was kept Prisoner by  Edward  and to set up this King against the other but was met upon the Road by the Duke of  Clarence  his SoninLaw and the Marquess of  Montague  who told him that  Edward  having desired the Archbishop of  York  to let him go sometimes out of the Castle to divert himself with Hunting and that Prelate who foresaw not the Design judging he ought not to refuse so small a Favour to the King he took the opportunity of making his escape with the assistance of  William Stanley  and  Thomas Borrough  his faithful Servants  This piece of News changed the whole face of Affairs so that instead of going to  London  they were forced to take another Road because  Edward  was got thither before them being received by the great Acclamations of the People So they went to  Lincoln  and the King having raised another Army engaged the Earl's Forces under the Command of Sir  Robert Wells  near  Stafford  But the Earl's Army was routed and the Commander in Chief taken Prisoner who had his Head cut off by the King's orders So sudden and so unexpected a change of Fortune wou'd have dismay'd any Person of a less firm and noble Resolution than himself He was sensible there was no staying for him in  England  his only affliction was to be forced to leave the Countess of  Devonshire  behind him being extreamly apprehensive of some ill Consequences in reference to the Love or hatred of King  Edward  The Civil Wars having raised so many different Parties in the Kingdom that the Countess saw herself obliged to change sometimes her Retirement she found an opportunity of discoursing  Berincour  he told her the Disgrace that had befal'n the Earl's Army that he was going to  Calais  with the Duke and Dutchess of  Clarence  and that he conjured her to come thither where they needed not fear any thing from their common Enemies and that if he could see her there he should enjoy that Tranquillity of Mind he stood so much in need of to avoid a thousand other Mishaps  The Countess shew'd a great deal of regret at the Misfortune of her Lover and much regard to his Tenderness for her Person but could not resolve to go beyond Sea  No mention would be made  said she  of what I had to fear from  Edward  in  England  but they would be sure not to forget to report that I was gone to  France  to see the Earl of  Warwick  However I don't intend to outbrave all Dangers I will keep myself concealed  She writ a Consolatory Letter to the Earl but quite over whelm'd with Grief was forced to leave  Berincour  and to shut herself up in her Closet to afford a free course to her Tears for certainly never any Lady loved a Man so dearly as she did this Illustrious Earl from the very first minute she saw him and she could not reproach him with one minutes Neglect in those Days the Heroes remain'd faithful to their Mistresses without being Happy but in our Times things are quite otherwise  The Earl of  Warwick  expected with much impatience the return of  Berincour  The Countesses Letter was so positive that finding no Hopes to flatter himself that she would come to  Calais  he found his Safety to depend on his  dispatch of going thither without her So he  eft the Coast of  England  condoling the Countess of  Devonshire  's Condition and sometimes reproaching her want of Resolution Soon after he came in sight of the Harbour of  Calais  where instead of being admitted into the Place he had occasion to make trial of those ill chances of Fortune which are the ordinary attendants of unfortunate Persons He had made one  Vauclere  a Gentleman of  Gascony  Governour of the Place in his Absence This Man understanding the Disgrace of his Benefactor was so far from opening the Gates to him that he play'd his Cannon upon the Ships of the Earl of  Warwick  which he had infallibly sunk had they not immediately made off to Sea  You may guess at the Inquietude and Indignation such an Action as this raised in the brave  Warwick  But to increase his Misfortune the Dutchess of  Clarence  his Daughter frightned at the Danger she saw herself exposed to was brought to Bed of a Son at a time when they wanted even Necessaries for his subsistence The Earl of  Warwick  seeing them in so deplorable a state thought sit to make his Resentment give way to the love he bore to his Daughter He sent to  Vauclere  to desire him to permit the new born Duke of  Clarence  to be Baptized in the Town and to send some Refreshment for the Dutchess who was ready to die for want of them  Vauclere  comply'd with both and the Duke and Earl seeing there was no hopes of being admitted into that place set sail for  Diep  where they met with a good Reception  Having spent some time to refresh themselves and the Dutchess of  Clarence  finding herself strong enough to undertake in Company with her Father her Husband and Sister a Journey to  Amboise  where King  Lewis  XI then kept his Court they met with so favourable a Reception from that Monarch that they had all the reason in the World to hope for his Protection for the King did not in the least doubt but that the Earl being sensible of the Affront put upon him in the Negotiation of the Match of the Princess of  Savoy  as well as upon that illustrious Lady had upon that score revolted from  England  and the Earl soon had intelligence that  Charles  Duke of  Burgundy  had been so bold as to threaten King  Lewis  with a bloody War if he supported them But that Prince thinking his Honour concerned in this Quarrel resolved to espouse it publickly  Margaret  of  Anjou  Spouse to that unfortunate King who was kept Prisoner by King  Edward  led a melancholy Life in  France  this being the only place from whence she hoped to retain some succours to recover the Throne She was not unacquainted with the Earl of  Warwick  's Design to serve her Spouse so that to shew her acknowledgement she came in Person to visit and return him Thanks The Dutchess of  Clarence  being still much out of order by reason of the Fatigues of her late Journey the Queen would also pay her a Visit accompany'd by her Son This young Prince's Stature was already much beyond his Age and his Beauty and noble Air were infallible Signs of his high Birth The Queen and the Dutchess of  Clarence  shed abundance of Tears so that the remembrance of their Misfortunes for a considerable time would not permit them to think or to talk of any thing else But so soon as the Queen was a little at leisure and cast her Eyes upon  Ann Nevil  Daughter to the Earl of  Warwick  and younger Sister to the Dutchess she stood amazed at her  most ravishing Beauty and the Prince of  Wales  Son felt the effects thereof as soon as he  w her and tho' he was otherwise Master of  refin'd and pleasing Wit yet he could do no  ing at this time but confine himself to a bare  dmiration without being able to entertain her  he could have wish'd to do  The Queen join'd all her Interest with the Earl for  Henry  against  Edward  desiring he would make use of all his Credit with  Lewis  XI to get some Troops from him For notwithstanding she was related to him and had urged him for a long time upon that point he had always found means to evade the Matter under some pretence or other but so soon as the Earl claim'd his share in the Obligation the King granted them every thing they desired  The hopes of their speedy return into  England  at the Head of a good Army afforded a secret satisfaction as well to the Queen as to the Earl The better to cement their Union they visited one another every Day and made private Feasts in which the Prince of  Wales  made all his Application to my Lady  Anne  whom he often regaled with Flowers and Garlands with an Air sufficently discovering his Fear and Confusion and as she receiv'd them not without some Emotion so they talk'd but little when they were together but were both uneasie when asunder The Prince of  Wales  hast flattered himself that my Lady  Anne  would go along with the Queen his Mother who intended to go into  England  but understanding the Earl of  Warwick  did not think it convenient they should leave the  French  Court he was ready to die with Grief The first Motions of a Passion are stronger and more respectful than all the rest He would tremble when he sat down by her and how desirous soever he was to speak to her he durst not venture  at it His Inquietudes and the continual Scruples that afflicted his Mind produced such a change in him that he was scarce to be known The Queen of  England  was frightned thereat and the whole Court took notice of it  The Dutchess of  Clarence  frequently keeping her Chamber my Lady  Anne  was commonly with her so that when the Queen came to see and talk with her the Prince of  Wales  at last took the boldness to entertain his Lady  Madam  said he one Day to her  notwithstanding my being reduced to a languishing Condition I am sprightly enough not to neglect any thing that relates to you I have been very careful to send to Madam  the Dutchess of  Orleans    for your Case That is to say  reply'd my Lady  that her Lottery is drawn I must own I should be exceeding glad to have a Prize because I should look upon it as a good Omen to our Affairs There are in this Lottery so many different Prizes  said the Prince  that perhaps that which falls to our Lot may not be pleasing to you Nay 'tis true  said she with a low Voice  that if there be any extraordinary Jewel to be had Madam will endeavour it shall fall to the Count of  Beanjeut's  share And have you taken notice  continued the Prince  that she  some particular Sentiments for him Truly  said she  one need not be a Witch to guess at her Sentiments in that regard besides that I hear my Father talking so often with my Sister upon that Point that I dare not challenge the honour of this Discovery But  Signieur added she  satisfie my Curiosity and let me open the Case So fair a Hand as yours  said he  can't miss of crawing a good PrizeTicket  And so he presented to her a neat Case or Box on the top whereof was Engraven the God of Silence  Guess  said my Lady  Anne  to him smiling  what means this  Hieroglyphe It means that if we get nothing we  ll say nothing for in this World there is no  hing like hiding ones own Disgrace But I Madam  cry'd he  should explain it after a quite different manner this God of Silence signifies that People who are Contented should not divulge nor boast of their good Fortune Then you will never talk of yours  said she  No  continu'd he  Madam I will never speak of it no if I do it shall be to nobody but to you  In the mean while my Lady opening the Box and pulling out a small Ticket or Billet  Ah Prince  cry'd she with a joyful Air  I have got something  and then read these following Words  The Prince of  Wales  's Heart for my Lady  Anne  She was considering of what had happened when the Prince laying hold of this opportunity  Chance has determin'd my Lot Madam  said he  and give me leave to improve this happy juncture to make to you a Confession full of Respect and Sincerity which will perhaps meet with Disdain at your Hands tho' at the same time it makes you sensible of the force of your Char  s and of my Passion Why  Signieur  should you imagine I should hear you with so much indifferency Alas Madam I am very willing to do myself Justice  continu'd he  I am an unfortunate Prince without a Crown and without a Kingdom you deserve one▪ and I am not in a Condition to offer it to you but I have a tender and faithful Heart that adores you  He said no more not daring to look my Lady in the Face but as she had never seen any thing in her Life she thought more amiable than that young Prince she told him with much Modesty and a graceful Air  Can you imagine  Signieur  I should not remember that you are the Son of a great King and that such another Revolution as has took you from the Throne may  place you there again with more lustre than ever 'Tis true Madam  added the Prince  what you say is not altogether impossible but Madam supposing I shou'd always continue unfortunate wou'd you not permit me to adore you  My Lady blush'd and told him with a smile  she used not to answer such unnecessary Questions  About the same time the Queen of  France  being brought to Bed of a  Dauphin  afterwards call'd  Charles  VIII the whole Court was infinitely rejoiced thereat and the King would needs have the Prince of  Wales  to stand Godfather  The Ceremony was perform'd with much Magnificence and the young Prince going to return his Thanks to the King for the Honour he had done him found him alone in his Closet and in an exceeding good Humour upon the Birth of his Son he had the goodness to tell the Prince  I intend to make you Happy  who thereupon throwing himself at his Feet and embracing his Knees  Sir  said he  'tis in your Power to render me Happy as long as I live 'tis neither your Treasure I covet nor your Troops my Ambition reaches much higher What is it you desire then Nephew  reply'd the King somewhat surprized at the young Prince's Words  Sir  continu'd he  since your Majesty gives me leave to tell it all my Desire is centred in my Lady  Anne  let her be my Spouse let Fortune prove never so averse to me otherwise I shall live always contented with her  The King told him he would think of it and upon farther consideration judging it for their common Interest to unite the Houses of  Lancaster  and  Warwick  and by this means to make the young Prince Brotherin Law to the Duke of  Clarence  he proposed the match to the Queen of  England  who approving of it the Nuptials were celebrated with much Magnificence and to  the most sensible Joy and Satisfaction of the new  arried Gouple  Those of the Earl's party in  England  had not  eased to labour under hand without intermission  he Reestablishment of their Affairs and tho' the Earl's two Brothers espoused in outward appear  nce the King's Cause it was only to be inform'd  he better of all his Transactions Whilst the King thinking his Enemy to be past all recovery thought of nothing but Feasting Hunting and Plays wherein the fair Sex had their full share the Duke of  Burgundy  his Brotherinlaw not so much addicted to Gallantry but far surpassing him in point of Prudence did not cease to give him notice from time to time that before long he would have work enought to combat a  Hydra  whose Heads he'd find a hard task to cut off if he gave it time to grow to its full strength But these advices remained unregarded  The Earl of  Warwick  was continually sollicited to come over into  England  where as they told him every thing was ready they only wanting his Presence He fail'd not to give an account thereof to the King of  France  and the Queen of  England  and the Troops which King  Lewis  intended as Auxiliaries to Queen  Margaret  not being as yet ready to embark it was agreed the Earl should go into  England  first to encourage his Party by his Presence  There was one obstacle in the way  viz  a strong Squadron of Ships of the Duke of  Burgundy  's which were Cruizing on the  English  Coast to prevent the Transportation of any Troops out of  France  thither The Enterprize was hazardous and the Earl of  Warwick  had all the reason to dread the falling into the hands of the Duke of  Burgundy  his mortal Enemy He was sensible of the danger but not so far as to think it sufficient not to venture at it the sole consideration  of coming once more near to his Countess being sufficient to make him hasten his Departure Providence seem'd to take peculiar care of him at that Juncture the Fleet of the Duke of  Burgundy  being dispersed by a Tempest just when the Earl was got aboard his Ship he arrived safely with all that attended him without any opposition at  Dartmouth  He fail'd not to give notice of his Arrival to all his Friends and publish'd a Proclamation requiring every Man able to bear Arms from Sixteen to Sixty years should come to join him to aid him in the Reestablishment of  Henry  who had been unjustly Dethroned by the Duke of  York  so that he soon gat himself at the head of an Army of Sixty thousand Men Upon this unexpected News  Edward  was awakened out of his  Lethargy  wherein Love and Pleasure had involved him His Courage was such as to be able to undergo a much severer shock of Fortune than this He drew together his Troops but those being but few in number he thought it most expedient to Encamp near the Seaside the better to take precaution against all Events  This foresight stood him in no small stead for at the sollicitation of the Marquess of  Montague  in whom he confided and who made but an ill use of his Trust upon this occasion being deserted by his little Army he was forced to think of saving himself by Sea He was then at the Castle of  Lynn  and hearing them cry every where Long live  Henry  he ordred them to defend the Bridge till such time he and the Duke of  Gloucester  his Brother could get aboard a Ship to seek for Refuge among their Neighbours He steer'd his Course for  Flanders  very ill provided and attended wanting even Necessaries for sustenance having carry'd nothing along with  him but his Arms wherewith to defend himself or to die like a Man of Courage  What a strange Revolution  said he to the Duke of  Gloucester we are here swimming upon the Sea without Money without Friends and without knowing where to seek for Refuge who would ever put his Confidence in Fortune All my hopes is in the Duke of  Clarence  Why Sir  said the Duke of  Gloucester is my Brother so happy as to be reconciled to you Has your Majesty forgiven him his I reason 'Tis a Secret I dare to intrust you with  reply'd the King  I have sent back into  France  one of the Dutchess of  Clarence's  Women a person of so much Sense and Conduct that I have left it to her management to negotiate with her Master concerning what I have proposed to him She has made him sensible that nothing can be more derogatory to the Grandeur of our House than to be serviceable to that of  Lancaster  that his true Interest and that of the Earl of  Warwick  are quite opposite and that if he will repent heartily I am ready to pardon him He has actually done so  added  Edward but it is not time yet to declare himself However 'tis this that flatters my thoughts my soul fluctuating betwixt hopes and fear promises it self a possibility of a happy return I am fully perswaded as well as your Majesty  said the Duke of  Gloucester we shall still see another favourable Revolution which will recover you that Throne you have lost  Thus these two Princes endeavoured to afford one another the best Comfort they could under their present Circumstances  So soon as the Marquess of  Montague  was come into his Brother's Camp they shut themselves up together and every body judged no otherwise than that this was done in order to take the best measures they could to improve and  pursue so happy a beginning But they were much out in their guess The two Brothers after having embraced one another talk'd of nothing but the Countess of  Devonshire  The Earl ask'd what News he had of her with the utmost impatience and the Marquess told him that the King having discovered the Place of her Retirement went thither and conjured her to let him speak with her and that for fear of exasperating him and dreading some ill usuage if she did not she had at last resolved to see him  'Oh Brother what is it you tell me cry'd the Earl He is a Prince worthy to be beloved how I dread this Conversation I must confess reply'd the Marquess I was as much concern'd at it as you are and would have given my Life to have been able to interrupt it but the King was no sooner come away but he call'd and told me I can't forbear to esteem the Countess tho' she treats me with so much haughtiness and indifferency She has so great a share of Vertue that tho' I lose all hopes of being beloved by her I can't cease to love This relation said the Marquess proved a comfort to me to such a degree as you may imagine I desired the King to banish from his heart a person who return'd him nothing but Ingratitude and finding he intended to see her again I writ her a Letter telling her That if my advice were not suspected by her I thought she would not do amiss to retire at some greater distance from  London  to avoid further inconveniences She thank'd me for my care and immediately after went away with my Lord  Stanley  and his Lady to  Nittingham  How cry'd the Earl is she so near us Go go let us find her out I can't live without seeing her'  Had the Earl of  Warwick  been less intangled in his Passion for the Countess of  Devonshire  he had bestowed his time in the pursuit of the King and might in all probability have overtaken him but he sacrificed all his Interest to his Love he desired his Brother to remain in the Camp whilst he went to find out the Countess being resolved once more to make her an Offer of a Crown Fortune had put into her hands and which was now at his disposal A thousand different thoughts came into his head some tending to flatter his hopes others to drive him to despair sometimes he hoped she would accept of the Crown and soon after he feared she would not But to  Nottingham  he went with the utmost speed but was no sooner arrived there when he was told that my Lord  Stanley  was gone from thence with all his Family towards  London  being frightned at the approach of the Armies and that the Countess of  Devonshire  was preparing to retreat to some solitary place where it would be very hard to find her out The Earl was once in a mind to follow her but at last considering what danger he was likely to expose himself to if he should be met by some of King  Edward  's Parties he thought it best to dispatch  Berincour  to the Countess unto whom he writ the following Letter  That same heart Madam that adores you comes to offer you the Crown of  England  dispose of the heart dispose of the Crown make me happy to accept of both  'Perswade my Lady  Devonshire  said the Earl that if she refuses my Offer with the same obstinacy as she did the last time I saw her I shall in losing all hopes of possessing her become  quite careless of my Life and only strives to put an end to it by a sudden death'  Berincour  overtook the Countess at some miles distance from  London  where she staid for a little time when she faw him she changed colour being sensible of all the motions that are commonly felt when one expects some immediate News from what ones loves  'My Lord is once more Victorious said she drawing nearer to the Gentleman and you may easily imagine I am more rejoyc'd thereat than any other person living It is your own fault Madam reply'd  Berincour  if you will not convince him of that truth for hitherto you have given him occasion to doubt of it'  The Countess answered only with a deep figh and taking the Letter he presented to her she read it over and over and at last repeated the same things to  Berincour  she had told his Master before  'I have much more Tenderness than Ambition added she I am sensible of the infinite Deserts of the Earl of  Warwick  I have reason to believe he loves me I preserve a most sincere acknowledgment for him I am certain also I shall never be happy without either his Person or his Tenderness but after this frank confession what can he ask more of me Is not he the Man who fought my Husband is it not he that kill'd him How is it in my Power to marry him and if I could give my consent to it I am certain I should forfeit his Esteem'  All what  Berincour  was able to alledge to inspire other Sentiments into her proving fruitless he saw himself obliged to leave her extreamly dissatisfy'd at this ill Success She writ to the Earl to thank him for the Honour he did her and to tell him how much afflicted she was because her present Circumstances would  not permit her to accept of his Offer So  Berincour  left her under a greater affliction than ever she had been sensible of before in all her life time  The Earl of  Warwick  expected with the utmost impatience the Return of  Berincour  who when he came brought him such an answer from my Lady  Devonshire  as served only to render him more unfortunate He shut himself up in his Closet the better to afford a free course to his Complaints he cry'd he call'd a thousand times for death and then considering within himself how to dispose of one of the best Crowns in the World he took a sudden resolution and putting himself at the head of his Army that was ready to march cry'd  Long live King  Henry  Heavens preserve him may his Reign prove auspicious  The Officers and Souldiers set up a loud Huzzah and so march'd forward to  London  The Earl of  Warwick  went immediately to the  Tower  and delivered  Henry  from a long Captivity King  Edward  had made him undergo You may guess at the surprize and joy of this unfortunate King and what he said to his Deliverer at a time when he little dream'd of the Recovery of his Liberty and Crown The Earl received his Competitor with a most profound Respect and when he assured him of his Acknowledgment he begg'd to consider him as his most humble Subject who thought himself too happy in having been Instrumental to restore him to the Throne and then conducted him in great State to the Cathedral  In the mean while the unfortunate Queen  Isabella  who had not been able to follow King  Edward  in his flight understanding the News of this strange Revolution and of the Earl of  Warwick  's approach to  London  she sought for Refuge  in the Church of  Westminster  against her Victorious but mortal Enemy where she was delivered of the Eldest Son she bore to King  Edward  who as he bore his Father's Name so he was no loss unfortunate in his Reign The Earl understanding what a condition she was reduced to sent  Berincour  to her to let her know with his utmost Respect that she needed fear nothing in a place where he had some Authority But the Queen return'd no answer but by Sobs Sighs and Tears  Berincour  told the Earl the Queen was in a most miserable condition and stood in need of every thing He moved with Compassion sent him back immediately to offer her a considerable Sum of Money in a very rich Box  Whatever my Right may be to this Mony  said she  'tis enough it comes from the Earl of  Warwick  for me to refuse it The most lamentable state I am reduced to can't make me be so forgetful as not to remember him to be our most mortal Enemy Return him his Present he is used to be liberal with what is none of his own witness the Crown of  Edward  he is going to put upon  Henry's  Head Madam  said  Berincour may I be so bold as to represent to your Majesty that at all  one must not  en to ones resentment  accept of my Master's Present it may perhaps prove a means to reconcile him to your Interest No  said she  I hope for nothing from a revo  ed Subject In the condition the Royal Family is now reduced to we can hope for no assistance but only from Heaven  Thus this Magnanimous Princess would not accept of the Earl's Present and remain'd in  Westminster  Church to shelter her self against the Violences she dreaded from the House of  Lancaster  So soon as the Earl had in the King's Name given the Necessary Orders  according to the present exigency of Affairs and had dispatch'd several Expresses to  Lewis  the Eleventh and Queen  Margaret  to inform them of his good Success he now began to inform himself exactly concerning what Course  Edward  had steer'd after his Departure out of  England  He was inform'd that he being pursued in the open Sea by Eight Privateers whom he was not able to engage was in the utmost danger of being taken by them had not a fair Wind sprung up and carry'd him to  Alemar  in the Province of  Holland  The  Signior Grutze  Governour of the place was as good fortune would have it for King  Edward  just then present there who upon the first notice of his Arrival went aboard himself offering him every thing that was in his Power  My condition is deplorable  said  Edward  to him  but you receive me with so much kindness as will make me almost insensible of my misfortune  Then turning him to the Master of the Ship who had brought him over he presented him with his Coat lined with Martin Sables  I give you but a slender Reward  said he  but 'tis all I have left  The Captain kissing his hand upon his knees  I am too well rewarded Sir  reply'd he  in having the honour of being serviceable to your Majesty  King  Edward  being supply'd by the said Governour with Clothes Money and other Necessaries went to the  Hague  where the Duke of  Burgundy  then kept his Court That Duke seeing him in so miserable a condition did not fail to furnish  Edward  his Brother in law and those that came along with him with all manner of Neeessaries but as to the Succours he desired to enable him to return into  England  that Affair met with some difficulties  The Earl of  Warwick  less taken up with the weight of his publick Affairs than with his Passion thought scarce of any thing else but the Countess He had been in search for her every where and now despairing to find her  Alas  said he to the Marquess of  Montague because you persist in loving her marry her Brother in seeing you happy I shall find some matter of comfort to my self and it will serve me as an undeniable reason to cure me of all the hopes I had conceived of becoming her Husband You see her rigour towards me she shuns me I can't as much as see her She treats me as harshly as your self  reply'd the Marquess  but with this difference that she loves you but only looks upon mine as an importunate Passion  They discoursed for some time longer concerning their mutual misfortunes this being the only comfort they had in the Countess s absence At last the Earl quite oppress'd with Grief frankly confess'd to his Brother That he heartily wish'd to be delivered by Death of those most cruel pains that continually tormented him  King  Henry  having constituted the Duke of  Clarence  and the Earl of  Warwick  Governours of the Kingdom the last was very vigilant in taking all possible precautions against any sudden surprize But being obliged to march with a good Body of Troops into the North of  England  to secure King  Henry  's Interest there  Edward  tool this opportunity to Land with Men without any opposition from those who were intrusted with the Defence of the Coasts on that side Besides which the Duke of  Clarence  who under pretence of being highly exasperated against his Brother  Edward  had got a great Ascendant over King  Henry  and the Earl deserted their Party and join'd his Forces with  Edward  They march'd directly to  London  which City seldom constant to its Choice opened its Gates without the least resistance in spite of all what  Henry  could do or say to the contrary and he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Victorious Enemy this being the fourth time he was taken a Prisoner The Earl of  Warwick  upon this no less doleful than surprizing News drew together what Troops he could directing his March towards  London  in hopes of surprizing King  Edward  but this Prince no less vigilant upon any occasion of moment than he was careless in matters of no great consequence was already got into the Field and marching directly against him The Earl animated at the presence of a Monarch who had so ill rewarded his Services and fearing that the King's Party might encrease whilst his was likely to diminish did not think fit to expect the  French  Auxiliaries Queen  Margaret  was to bring to his assistance  You are for fighting  said the Marquess of  Montague  to him  and so am I but this day must decide the Fate of our Lives If we are worsted let us have this comfort at least to die in the Field of Battel without carrying away our Disgrace and Misfortune along with us We will  reply'd the Earl  bereave our selves of the very means thereof  And so alighting from his Horse the Marquess did the like and they sent their Horses without the Camp  Berincour  was also dispatch'd by his Master to the Countess of  Devonshire  to assure her that if he dy'd in the Battle he should not regret so much his Life as that he had not been able to merit her heart and her hand  Soon after was fought the famous Battle of  Barnet  the great Actions perform'd there by  Edward  by the Earl and Marquess surpass'd those of all the rest But at last Fortune declared  for the King the Earl's Troops at first forced those of  Edward  to give way but these returning to the Charge put the Earl's Army to flight Ten thousand Men were slain in the Field of Battle the Earl of  Warwick  and the Marquess of  Montague  did all they could to rally their Forces but in vain and King  Edward  being in every place where his Presence was necessary animated his Troops by his Example and Words and espying the Earl ran towards him with his Sword drawn to decide their personal Quarrel upon this Occasion But whilst they were engaging a whole Troop of  Edward  's Soldiers fell upon the Earl and mortally wou  ded him the Marquess of  Montague  endeavouri  g to rescue his Brother underwent the same fate Thus fell these two great Men who were always formidable to their Enemies The Earl of  Warwick  had obtain'd the Sirname of the  Achilles  of  England  being the darling of the People and the Terrour of his Enemies they were universally lamented King  Edward  being the only Gainer in this Universal Loss  Scarce was the Noise of this Victory spread over the Kingdom but King  Henry  's Party left destitute of all hopes  Edward  had now no more Enemies to encounter but Queen  Margaret  and the Prince of  Wales  lately landed in  England  with a good body of  French  and looking upon the Victory he had obtain'd against the Earl of  Warwick  as a happy presage of his future Success against the Queen he engaged them near  Tewksbury  This most couragious Princess fighting at the head of her Troops like an  Amazon  saw the Prince of  Wales  drop dead near her having receiv'd many Wounds she threw herself upon his Body endeavouring to secure him against a vast number of Swords directed against his Body but in vain  her only Son was gone which she perceiving fought like a desperate Woman who was willing to lose her Life upon the spot However she was taken Prisoner and the Duke of  Somerset  of the Royal Blood of the House of  Lancaster  along with her the last had his Head cut off the next Day by King  Edward  Thus  England  stain'd with the Blood of its Princes sacrificed its Subjects to the Fury of an Intestine War  The victorious King carry'd  Henry  and  Margaret  two most deplorable Instances of the Frailty of humane Affairs along with him in his March and near their Litters you might see the two Bodies of the Earl of  Warwick  and his Brother the Marquess of  Montague  in an open Chariot all uncovered  Edward  being willing to expose them to every Bodies sight for fear somebody or other should make use of their Names to head a new Party In this manner he made his entrance in  London  and he shut up  Henry  in the  Tower  where he a few Days after was Murdered by the Duke of  Gloucester  but Queen  Margaret  was ransomed by her Father the King of  Sicily  for thirty Thousand Crowns  The Countess of  Devonshire  led so retired a Life ever since the last refusal of espousing the Earl of  Warwick  and this refusal went so near her Heart that she would not be seen even by those of her own Family she had bought a little House in one of the most solitary places of  London  which she took some delight in fitting up she caused all her Adventures to be drawn in a Closet where the Earl's Picture was drawn in a thousand Places She diverted herself with Books Birds a fine FlowerGarden and had three Women among her Attendance who sung and play'd most charmingly upon several Musical  Instruments This Solitude she judged might serve instead of a Nunnery for she received no Visits and was always employ'd in sending forth her Prayers and Vows to Heaven to bless the Army of the Earl of  Warwick  The Danger she knew he must after be exposed to would not suffer her to live in Tranquillity for sometimes she fancied she saw him in the midst of an Army rais'd in haste who might easily quit his Party and go over to King  Edward  and after all supposing no such thing might happen she dreaded the Event of a decisive Battle or some other fatal Accident  Her Mind was taken up with these Reflections when  Berincour  came he told her his Master had sent him away that very time when he was preparing to give Battle to  Edward  that all the weighty Affairs that lay upon his Shoulders had not in the least diminish'd his Passion unto which he seem'd to postpone every thing else that tho' her Absence had been almost insupportable to him he had continued never the less faithful and that the Heroe in his Person had never got the precedency before the Lover  'I am sensible of every thing I owe to the Earl his Idea is always in my Mind  reply'd the Countess  I pray incessantly for his Preservation were it even at the expence of my Life and his Glory whereby he gains an immortal Crown sometimes gives me some Notions of Vanity which is not altogether free from SelfInterest but  Berincour  how dearly do I pay for these pleasing Minutes for soon after I am overwhelm'd with a world of melancholy Thoughts which make me dread some ill  Fate for what I so dearly love A happy Indifferency is worthy of the Envy of all the World'  Her Eyes being fill'd with Tears  'You see  continu'd she  you see me cry and I am not able to stop my Tears I am disturb'd all Night with terrible Dreams O good God  cry'd she  Would it be possible for me to outlive my Illustrious Friend Go return to him make him sensible of my Frailties recommend to him from me to be careful of a Life whereon depends the Preservation of my own Let him come back let him come back'  'But Madam  said  Berincour you give me no promise of your Marriage So long as you refuse to unite your Destiny with his believe me he will take no Care of himself if he dies Madam won't you have a great deal to reproach to yourself'  'You confound me  continu'd she  but I assure you I am sufficiently unhappy already don't add to my Misfortune'  So  Berincour  saw himself obliged to depart without being able to obtain any thing in Favour of his Master  The Countess as I told you having taken a resolution not to be seen by any body she used to go to Church early every Morning and that in a Chair She was covered with a Veil in the Earl of  Warwick  's Chappel when the Earl's Body and that of the Marquess of  Montague  were exposed to publick View in St  Paul  's Church by King  Edward  's particular Command They were covered all over with Blood their Wounds conspicuous in many Parts and Death appear'd in its natural colour in their Faces  I will not pretend to represent here the Pain the Countess  Devonshire  felt at that time She had been beloved both by the Earl and by the Marquess with so lively constant and respectful a Passion that they had never given her the least occasion of Complaint against them 'Twas also no less true that she had never seen any Man whose Deserts could challenge a Preference before those of the Earl of  Warwick  who was Master of a vast share of Wit Valour and all the other Qualifications which made him the most accomplish'd Heroe in the Universe  'Till this fatal Moment she had had Power enough over herself to conceal the infinite tenderness she had for him but now all these Passions contain'd hitherto within the bounds of the Empire of Reason broke forth with so much impetuosity that with a thousand Cries and Lamentations she threw herself upon the dead and bloody Corps of her faithful Lover Here she shed a torrent of Tears which was not stop'd but with the loss both of her Sight and Voice her Eyes remain'd fix'd without the least Motions upon him Her delicious red and white Complexion changed into a deadly paleness They endeavoured to draw her away by force but she squeezing the Earl's Hand close to her Bosom fetch'd a very deep sigh and so expired in the Arms of her Woman before they were able to remove her from the place or give her any real Assistance happy in her Misfortunes because her Grief would not suffer her to outlive what she loved  The Extraction of the Countess was such and her Beauty so extraordinary and so much celebrated  that there were few People in  England  that did not hear and lament her Destiny My Lord  Stanley  her Brother who loved her tenderly being almost inconsolable desired the King she might be buried in the same Tomb with the Earl of  Warwick  King  Edward  consented being unwilling to separate such precious Ashes and being highly afflicted at the  Exit  of so wonderful a Person whom he had loved with so much tenderness But he having still a great many Enemies to contend with he was not altogether so sensible as he would have been at another time of the Countess of  Devonshire  's Death  FINIS  BOOKS Sold by  J Morphew  and  James Woodward  near

Account of the Change of that Court from Gallantry to Devotion or from open  Irreligion  to  Hypocrisy  HELA  my  pauvre  Sister saw you but the Austerities of  Versailles  and St  Germains  you would no longer be of Opinion that the Court of  England  was so inferior to 'em in Splendor and Delights I look upon my self no better than a banish'd Man and one grown old in Exile from his Native Country his Friends and Family 'Tis true my Duty obliges me to be here but alas how severe a Pleasure is that reckon'd with what I can now but barely reflect on Ev'n thou my Sister art little better than a Name to me I left thee so young that 'tis impossible to have any Idea of thee not but Nature or Impulse or what you please gives me an unaccountable Fondness for a Person I am wholly a stranger to since my Dear you can no longer pretend to be that beautiful little Creature of four Years old whose Image with all her pretty Prattle I still retain yes I say thou art now another She Thy Person and Understanding at its growth and I do not question but that they equally deserve our Admiration The last I can read in thy inimitable Letters Therefore wanting  the beautiful Substance of the other let me at least possess the lovely Shadow You have promised me your Picture pray do not delay it for that in any desired Blessing is a sort of a Refusal I leave it to your own choice whether in great or little 'tis equal to me whether I'm oblig'd to  Cross  or  Kneller  for the knowledge of my Sister or any other Artist that may perhaps have since outstript them in Reputation tho' when I was so happy to be in  England  they were deservedly esteem'd the best  I find Nature to be the same in all Countries and that whilst there be Women they will have Curiosities What is the News of our World to yours Would you have me write Novels instead of Letters I am told in your last that the first thing you do in receiving mine is in considering the quantity from thence to set a Price or Value upon the whole ah my dear Sister Truth and Kindness are not always the most voluminous We may say the dearest tenderest Things in a little room can any thing be more expressive than these words  I love  All other Terms of Passion are but derived from thence and yet how little Paper do they imploy 'Tis not then the Friendship in mine that you regard 'tis the News it affords and in this my dear Sister I am afraid you shew your self little better than a plain Gossip but because I'm not well enough acquainted with you to chide it shall be a happiness to me that any way I can make a banish'd Brother's Remembrance acceptable to you  But to begin with the Court at  Versailles  it has an Air of nothing but Devotion 'Tis no longer there that Gallantry appears barefaced  Lewis  XIV seems to have outliv'd himself and  the gay Customs of the former part of his Reign That universal Spirit of  Love  and  Pleasure  that sway'd every Heart with absolute Power is now no more Those noble Assemblies are dissolved where Love was permitted to shew it self without disguise Then without wonder two  Lovers  inspired by the same desire might enjoy their mutual Pleasures for Scandal was lost where all were guilty Nor could the wellmanner'd Persons of either Sex make their Court more  adroitly  to their Monarch than by sorting themselves to his Inclination Whence proceeds so dismal a Change Is it because his Age has varied the Season Be it so but 'tis not generous to forbid  Love  to others because he has outliv'd the force of it himself can any thing be more envious Were it in his power I believe the whole World should be of one Age and Taste and not a Mortal appear at Court under Sixty odd Then Beads and Reliques might be in season tho' nothing else is now to be seen there with dull  seeminglyReligious  Faces Nor Discourses to be heard but of  Saints Days  and their  Vigils Hypocrisy  has dispossess'd  Love  from its lawful and beautiful Throne and like most absolute usurping Tyranny reigns uneasily and not without pain reduces his Subjects to submit to its unbounded Power Oh were it possible to look into the King's Breast to see if his  Devotion  be true and how it comes to pass that he should have Remorse for no other Sin but that which he is no longer in danger of committing  Love  which perhaps has been the least Criminal of all his Actions How is it he still remains unwearied with Persecution and Power that he knows not how to permit any other Monarch in  Europe  to be at ease unless  they be in effect his Creatures Can this be real  Piety  Can this be true  Devotion  Oh no  Religion  is always equal and consistent in all things and no more indulges  Sin  with than against Inclinations His Vices then have only shifted the scene  Tired with Love and surfeited with Joy  He hunts with Pleasure the unwearied Round of  Ambition Ambition  which has this of admirable in it is that still as one Hope is defeated 'tis recruited with another and of all the Passions 'tis the latest cloy'd  Ambition  that exorbitant Desire which is never sufficiently gratify'd but still encreases with Possession and which has so entirely fill'd the Soul of  Lewis  XIV that all his Actions are subservient to it Hence it is that with such an austere Air he assumes Devotion as an unquestion'd Veil to all his Tyranny nay 'tis so severely practis'd that a poor young Lady if she be but suspected to have a  Lover  has a Letter of  Lachet  sent her to withdraw as too Libertine an Ornament for a  Holy Court  These Severities my dear Sister pass not without Complaint among those Persons whom  Youth  and  Beauty  have fitted for other Diversions The Ladies I believe would not be displeas'd to see a younger Prince upon the Throne who has three Sons all disposed to gay and softer Inclinations so that we may justly say The whole Nation groans under  Lewis  's Tyranny And that if he oppresses the Men with  Taxes Persecution  and  War  he no less constrains the Women by  Devotion  I was sitting at my ease behind a Fountain in the Garden at  Versailles  the other Evening when two Court Ladies came to repose themselves near me I  was hid from 'em by a Myrtle hedge thus they discours'd  Ah ma belle Comtess  crys one of 'em of what value is Youth and Beauty in such a Court as this We either are not admired or they must not discover it to us that we are Will not old  Age  or ill Faces serve well enough to follow the old insensible Monarch to  Marli  or Madam  Maintenon  to St  Cyr  Thank God I do not want Devotion but I would not altogether forget I am young and surely born to taste other Joys than what arise from Cant and Prayer nay they teach our very Husbands to believe that the Delights of Marriage should have something severe in 'em and that Excess in all things but Religion is to be condemn'd But their Opinions I could easier forgive than those Severities that forbid to us the innocent Pleasure of  Admiration  which let a Woman be never so honest she cannot miss without Inquietudes Oh the satisfaction of seeing one's self admired by a Crowd of Adorers all eager to oblige watching every Glance Catching at every turn of my Eyes or graceful Nod Pressing to do me service praising as I pass my Face my Shape my Manner This Air all languishing the next moment more gay all pleasing Let me tell you 'tis insufferable Tyranny inverting the Order of Nature a Tax upon our Youth and Beauty so exorbitant that Age and Ugliness is of as great an use and value and we might have as well been born  old  as live  young  to so little purpose as we do  I may venture my dear Sister to affirm that in this Lady's I send you the general Opinion and present State of the Feminine Court see then if it can possibly afford those sort of Adventures which you so passionately beg to hear I suppose 'tis otherwise with you  the Sun seems to rise on the Successes of that Court as it is declining or setting here all things appear to us like faded Glories we droop we languish as Persons without Hope We fear all Accidents since none of late have happened to our Advantage My dear Sister adieu and believe I passionately love and embrace you once more Adieu  LETTER II  To the same from the same being an Account of the salacious Amours of Madam  Montespan  one of the French King's Mistresses with Lords Gentlemen Players  c  I Imagine my dear Sister that you who are so full of Curiosity cannot but have read some of the many  Memoirs  that have been translated and printed in  English  concerning Madam  de Montespan  a former and beautiful Mistress of  Lewis  XIV You must therein have found how he took her from her Husband the late Marquis  de Montespan  who retired extreamly dissatisfied from Court at the Prerogative his Royal Master usurp'd of taking from Husbands their Wives whenever they appear'd Charming to him Madam  de Fontange  succeeded her in the King's Favour for alas what Love is there that remains always the same What Ardours are there which Time does not abate What Enjoyment that long deserves to be called such What Transports that do not fade ev'n before the Beauty that inspires 'em  Madam  Montespan  who had never any great Passion for the Person of the King saw his Change with less concern than any other wou'd have done and endeavour'd to comfort her self for his Loss in the Arms of a Thousand others In short she has made her self so great a Slave to Sensual Love enriching Worthless People to her own Ruin that we see her at this day the most despis'd from the most admir'd of her Age And whereas another in losing the King's Affections for the Honour of those Children she has had by him wou'd have endeavour'd to retrieve her Reputation and improv'd the great Estate the King's lavish Love had bestow'd upon her She has run counter to all discretion and very often seen her self without a Jewel the smallest piece of Plate or perhaps one Pistole Undone between  Cards  and  Lovers  she has scarce left her self a bare Subsistence and had not the King wisely foreseen the prodigality of her Temper and settled eighteen Thousand Crowns a Year to be paid her weekly I dare affirm that long ere this she had not had wherewith to eat but nothing made her so despicable as her calling that ugly fellow but excellent Comedian  Labrunne  from the  Stage  to her Service and  Bed  where as  Gentleman of the Horse  he rul'd both his Lady and Family for some years till being detected as a Traytor the King sent him to languish out the remainder of his Life at  Pignerol  Madam  Montespan  who had none of those Romantick Weaknesses call'd Constancy soon found wherewith to comfort her for the Comedian's absence for many Fellows more worthless if possible soon succeeded to her Favour in their Turns among whom the same Folly pursuing her to her Old Age she receiv'd one who had 'tis true been handsome in the Eye of the whole Town but so long since that every  body had forgot it but himself he still retain'd the Name and was vulgarly call'd  Handsom Du Prez  tho he wou'd admit of no other Title but  Monsieur le Comte du Prez Count  of the  Sacred Roman Empire  and in spight of what the Heraulds cou'd do he gave the  Roman Eagles  and bore 'em upon his Equipage  c  They at first laugh'd at and afterwards slighted him as a Madman and so left him to his  Imaginary Grandure  His Oeconomy as to his Affairs can have no better a Parallel than his Courage for if one was little t'other was less and he was no better than a Beggar when he apply'd himself in his Address to Madam  Montespan  Her Lord had bin dead about six Months when she marry'd this  Imaginary Count  and I have heard several fay that she wanted but this last Act of Indiscretion or rather Height of Folly to crown or close her foregoing Life and to make her descend to the Grave as she had liv'd the most deservedly despis'd and scorn'd of any Woman living  From so old so fantastical and so ill yet wellpair'd a Couple what cou'd be expected but a new Scene of Follies They were the Theme for Laughter of the whole Kingdom and wou'd have still better diverted had they not bin so far despis'd as to be neglected and many of their Follies safe from being repeated as too worthless for Conversation This ridiculous Garb extravagant Equipage and great Expence with his  Parade  through  Paris  in Diamond Buttons and other fantastical Calls to the Multitude were the common Theme amongst the  Vulgar  For People of Condition had left to speak of 'em yet thus safely might he have flourish'd if he had not joyn'd  Ingratitude  to the rest of his  Moral Virtues  and ill us'd that Lady from whence he drew his support She had call'd to her Family a Granddaughter of  hers nam'd Madam  Briancon  a Lady full of Youth and Fire with more Beauty than Discretion She was parted from her Husband for her criminal Conduct or at least the Appearance of it Madam  Montespan  receiv'd her with open Arms and as she is passionately fond of new Favourites of what Sex soever nothing was well done but what Madam  Briancon  order'd The Old Amorous Count of the  Sacred Empire  was soon cloy'd with his Bride's antiquated Charms nay if you will believe Scandal she was no new thing to him having several Years before when  Du Prez  was in his Beauty receiv'd him to her Arms But however it were he cou'd not every day see so much Youth and Agreeableness as Madam  Briancon  was Mistriss of without offering her his Heart There is certainly a  Lex Talionis  a Law of Retaliation in this World as well as the next and Madam  Montespan  who was her self consummate in Ingratitude and scarce ever bestow'd a Favour upon the  Deserving  now tasted the Return from her own  Grandchild  and  Husband  Madam  Briancon  accepted his odious Love because it came well accompany'd with Money and Presents of whatever he cou'd give her of her Grandmother's that was most valuable and so often were they in their Amours that the Old Lady quickly complain'd of being defrauded That she had indeed bought a Husband but another had the greatest and best Property in him Her Tongue had ever bin too shrill and bitter not to be a Nuisance to all that heard it and if upon her Friends her Intimates and Servants where she had no occasion she us'd loudly to exert her  of scurrilous Railing what think you became of her where she was so nearly concern'd She tore she roar'd and dry and old as she was she squeez'd out briny baleful Tears  which like drops from Yewtrees wou'd have scalded the most Verdant Grass But this little avail'd her the  Count  's Vanity was gratify'd by her violent Passions and Madam  Briancon  too charming and too kind must not be forsaken for her Grandmother The Fool thought himself Young again tho it was but an Old  Beldame  that contended for him and grew nauseously fond of his  Mistress  and intollerably slighting of his  Wife  the good jealous Marchioness no longer able to endure the daily Insults of her younger Charms dismiss'd Madam  Briancon  with a Million of Reproaches the Consequence of which was that the  Sacred Count  took a House for her and furnishing of it with what was most precious from the Marchioness he was Ten times more there than at home nay so far he carry'd his Ingratitude that he threatned his Lady with the Loss of her Life unless she wou'd consent to give him all that was in her Power Turn'd off her People put new Ones about her who were only Spies and Tormenters to her and refus'd to bring her what was necessary even to Eating and Drinking that no longer able to endure his Tyranny she left her House and fled for safety to her Sons the Duke  de Mayne  From whence she complain'd to the Parliament of  Paris  which takes cognizance of such Affairs and whilst the Process was depending far beyond her Hopes or Deserts it was discover'd that the  Roman Count  was some time before his Nuptials with Madam  Montespan  marry'd to a Woman who had been impos'd upon him by a pleasant Cheat for a Fortune The Tryal before the Council of State was very diverting and his Letters produc'd to his first Wife whilst he yet believ'd her a great Lady wherein he stil'd her  Countess of the Sacred Empire  with the Depositions of the Priest whom he first  ask'd to marry 'em where he gave him an Account of the Good Fortune that was happ'ning to him tho indeed she was not handsome but the more like a Woman of Quality The Case was clearly demonstrated the Marchioness was reliev'd from her ungrateful Husband and he adjudg'd to his first Wife whom he had barbarously us'd and left to starve and sentenc'd as the Law requires to undergo the Punishment due to him who shall remarry during the Life of his Wife But Madam  Briancon  by her Charms procur'd him the Protection of the Envoy of  Savoy  who receiv'd him into his House and shortly two of the first Dukes and Peers of the Realm who had Bail'd him when he stood committed upon the Marchionesses first Complaint got him the Royal Pardon not out of Kindness or Esteem for him he was not worth it but Hatred to Madam  Montespan  who when formerly in Power had made those two mighty Men her Enemies Therefore let none think to confer Injuries unforgotten or unreveng'd since there are none how despicable soever but in the Turn of a life may have opportunity to return the mischief  Thus my dear Sister I have in short giv'n you the Detail of Madam  Montespan  's Adventure while yet  Du Prez  's first Marriage was undiscover'd he carry'd it with the utmost Insolence against the  Marchioness  and in all Companies ridicul'd her and her Old fond Amours to all the height imaginable wrote or procur'd to be wrote Numbers of the most scandalous Verses or Ballads that ever your  Grubstreet  afforded and these he dispers'd with his own hand to all Comers and in all publick Places Tho' all condemn'd her  her ill Life and Marriage yet none took part with him unless it were some  whose Contempt of her surmounted their Contempt of him  Madam  Briancon  flourishes with the Addresses of the  Envoy  at whose House she is seen too often not but her Beauty has attracted another Lover and her kind Nature receiv'd him into the Number of the Happy and surely he deserves the Good Fortune of a Virginheart and one who shall sigh for him alone 'Tis the Young Count of  C  new return'd from Travel and who to all his other Accomplishments has this not inconsiderable One of near Fourscore Thousand Crowns Annual Rent  Will not this long Letter and of Adventures too oblige my dear Sister certainly to conclude that she may Command all things within the Power of her passionately Tender and most affectionate Brother and Servant  LETTER III  Being a Secret History of the Intrigues Amours  c  of the Frince of  Hesse  in  England  and  Spain  'TIS very true Madam your Ladyship's Memory is most exact but I think you lay too great a stress upon Accident for I can term it no other and you must certainly be mistaken in giving foreknowledge to an Old poor woman in a dirty Chimneycorner because she hapned to tell the Prince of  Hesse Darmstadt  that once in two Years he shou'd narrowly escape Death if he did escape it Having a near Relation  to Colonel  Nugent  who was Gentleman of the Horse to His Highness I often had the Honour of Conversing with the Prince and am glad 'tis in my Power to oblige you with some Memoirs of the Life of that brave Man he was second Son to the Younger House of  Hesse  call'd  Darmstadt  to distinguish it from  HesseCassel  the Elder his Name was  George  and according to the Custom of the Younger Princes of  Germany  he was made a Souldier of Fortune he had distinguish'd himself in several Campaigns and particularly in the  Irish  War where King  William  gave him a Regiment and favour'd our Hero with his Esteem After his Return to  Germany  the King of the  Romans  caress'd and bestow'd on him the Honour of his Friendship The Queen of  Spain  was then Contracted and Wedded by Proxy to  Charles  of  Spain  she was near related to our Prince And when the King of the  Romans  sent him to her Father's Court to have the Honour of attending her to her Husband at that time the Prince of  Hesse  was very handsom and tho' afterwards at the Age of Two and thirty years when we saw him in  England  he appear'd to us like a Man of Forty Weatherbeaten and fatigu'd yet was he well made of a good Mien and Height his Eyes black and unusually sweet the Goodness of his Temper was visible in his Countenance he had a large Soul generous to Profuseness believ'd well of all he convers'd with and wou'd be but with Pain undeceiv'd when he found that they answer'd not the Opinion he had of 'em The Queen's Interest procur'd him the Viceroyship of  Catalonia  and he held his Court at  Barcelona  with extreme Splendor When the King's Death and the Turn of Affairs call'd him to Court Cardinal  Fortocarero  did all that a cunning Politician cou'd to draw him into  the  French  Interest but with a Faith unshaken to the House of  Austria  he rather chose to resign his Government and return to  Germany  On his Highness's Arrival in  Spain  with the new Queen he found at Court the Princess Dowager of  she was a young Widow extreamly charming and as sensible of the Pains of Love as of giving them She could not see the graceful Person of the Prince which visibly confess'd the Hero and observe the good Qualities of his Mind by Conversation without some secret Wishes that she might not be indifferent to him nor could the Prince behold so uncommon a Beauty without Ardent Desires that she could look on him with a favourable Eye There was such a Sympathy betwixt the sweet Tempers of the Queen and this Princess that on the death of the King she retir'd to  Toledo  with her Majesty The Prince as firm as his Desires were and as much as he ask'd the Love of the Princess made Love give way to Business and Ambition went to his Government without informing the Princess with his Passion fearing the Declaration would oblige a longer Attendance than his Affairs or the Service of the King would permit And on the Death of  Charles  the Second he was forced to repair to  Madrid  in order to quit a Command he could not preserve without a breach of that Honour which he always profess'd but before he left  Spain  he went to take his leave of the Queen with this satisfaction that he should there see the charming Object of his Desires And tho' he could hope little from the short Time of his stay yet the Pleasure of seeing her would not permit him to think of the Pain it might cost him He has often told me in Confidence that the most glorious Evening of his Life was that when he  went to take his leave of the Princess at  Toledo  where the Cardinal had order'd the Queen to retire After the usual Compliments he told her Majesty the Business of his Audience was to receive her Commands for  Germany  The Princess waited his return from the Queen and gave occasion for a Passion as agreeable as tormenting but before he retir'd she desir'd his Company to her Closet for she had some Business with him which ought to be private He gave her his hand to conduct her and found her in an unusual Trembling and Disorder When she was seated and had paus'd some Moments with an enchanting Blush which cover'd her beauteous Face with Vermillion she cast her languishing and sparkling Eyes upon him and thus sweetly enquir'd  My Lord have not Women of such high Quality as mine do you think some Prerogative above other Women or else what does Title signify But alas we have the same Weaknesses with the rest of our Sex are sensible of the same Passions can hate as cruelly and love as violently but with this difference that we are seldom beloved at least the first time we are sure to be made Victims to our Quality and the Civil Laws of  Spain  oblige Widows of my Rank to retire to a Monastery What hope is there then for me What Expectation should the God of Love or the bright Queen his Mother touch my Heart with that Passion as to those Charming softnesses they so well know how to inspire And yet it is too true that I understand but too well the Laws of Tenderness I am in pain I almost love but know not how to assure my self of being belov'd That alone restrains me from going into those Heights which Love requires from usLadies of your beauteous Form  answer'd the Prince  without the advantage of great Titles are sure to have all the Returns that so great a Blessing  as being belov'd by you can really deserve But how  said the Princess  if I should cast mine on a Heart already engag'd Must I either make a Traytor or be unhappy my self I may boldly say  return'd the Prince  that before your Highness all Beauties are forgotten nay the very Memory is defaced of all preceding Tendernesses And if we have not been insensible before it is only to show the mighty difference betwixt those Languors another can inspire and those Passions your HighnessI'm then understood by you my Lord  reply'd the Princess hastily  this moment retire from me or I shall sink with Confusion But go no farther than  Madrid  take care not to leave our Kingdom till I have determin'd what to do with you  Whether his Highness obey'd I durst not so nicely enquire but I think from that time he became faithless to the Duke  d' Albuquerque  's Daughter He shew'd me the Princesses Picture done upon Vellum which he always carried about him without either Case or Frame in his Pocketbook Her Hair was flaxen her Eyes black and full of the natural Sweetness usual to that Colour He had it besides in Great hung up in his Closet and when the Prince would indulge himself it was in writing Letters to her of a prodigious length I cannot say fine for they seem'd to want it there were Attempts of Passion in them but nothing answerable to those of the Princess which made me conclude hers truly the effect of Love his only of Gratitude In the freedom I had with his Highness I found means unknown to him to Copy four of her Letters which I send you that you may judge how Nature would act in Ladies did not Custom restrain them But I dare not assure you that they do not suffer extremely in the Translation In their Originals  they have much more Softness and yet more Force and Fire yet such as I have made them I present to you  The Princess of  Letters to the Prince of  Hesse Darmstadt  LETTER I  Expressing her Ʋneasiness at the News of his Resolution of leaving  Spain  and desires before he goes to hear from him  THE Queen and Court wait for my Presence but Love ever uppermost in my soft Soul will be hearkned to though Affairs of the greatest moment were forced to be at a stand and wait till you are dispatch'd I hear you are preparing to leave  Spain  had your Soul lov'd with that Ardout it ought this Separation had not been Love ingenious to its own Satisfaction would have prevented its own Misfortunes Had it been my Province I could have found out a thousand ways to have prevented this Evil You stupid as you are fear to advance one step but by Rule Know you not that after my confessing Love I had no more to do The rest was yours What Courage is this when you only dare to wish and are afraid of acting What a Soul is that who declines his Fortune when with swelling Sails and prosperous Gales 'tis more than offer'd him Do you imagine that every day will present you a  Heart like mineGo by this Coldness you are unworthy of what I would have done for you Did I not bid you boldly askWhat should not that have taught you What Explanation had that but my self No Rest no Sleep should have been yours till at my Feet you had thank'd me as you ought for a Favour so inestimable How am I thus by a soft Resentment betray'd to make Reproaches foreign to the Manners and Character of a Woman of Honour Yet surely if ever they are to be pass'd over 'tis in favour of a Lover belov'd Come to me to Morrow but write to me to Night and write your true Thoughts mine are notwithstanding this petty Anger all yours  Adieu  You beg me to think of you some times I every Night see you in my Dreams judge then whether it is in my power not to think of you  LETTER II  Desiring to hear from him  WHoever would have told me that I could have felt in favour of any Person living what I feel for you I should have answered 'Twas impossible Write to me by this Courier but write as I do to you sincerely without Art or without design but of pleasing And if any part of that dangerous Poison has touch'd your Heart with which mine is fill'd if you can in the least feel any Stings of that Tenderness with which mine abounds I shall quickly shew that Fortune had not forgot you when she made me yours  LETTER III  YOur Letter was my Bedfellow last Night I laid it upon my Breast where my Heart beat it a Thousand welcomes Tell me what Almighty Power is there in liking how can it be in Nature that I have insensibly pass'd the Addresses of all the Great Men of my own Country yet am wounded by a Stranger without your ever designing it Not one Advance on your side to excuse that in me which you may cruelly call Levity whilst I feel and know 'tis Fate 'tis irresistible 'tis what I can't conquer and must indulge Beware of sacrificing me to your happy Mistress I will not name her least you should find a Pleasure in it and I would ingross all yours You deny to return my Letters and plead Discretion 'twould have been a better Argument if you had said you lov'd and could not restore 'em how pleas'd should I be if I thought you true when you write me that you behold my Rival with much more indifferency since I have honoured you with my Concern But I forget you are eternally ingag'd and I do ill to thrust rudely between two Hearts where Love seems to intend an Ʋnion nay perhaps I am impertinent in writing tedious Letters to a Man in Business whose Soul is fill'd with something less soft than Love or if fill'd 'tis for another and not for me Do not enquire too nicely what a Woman of Honour can mean by owning a Passion for a Man engaged I dare not yet consult my own Heart upon the Point all I know is that my Virtue is what it ought to be I love without other design but of making you in love with me that effected Fate must rule our Destiny and be answerable for the Event  I will not be so rigid as to impose answering my Letters by every Courier your Leisure and softer Moments be for me take my Example I write unartfully without Method or perhaps Coherence my Thoughts naturally as they arise in my Mind fall from my Pen not polish'd by Art nor better'd by Study if in Love any Study be of use therefore make not a Judgment of my Ʋnderstanding from the disguise my Passion has put it in or if you must judge judge truly that 'tis thus unfeignedly they love who thus unartfully do write  Could I be sure that it were agreeable to you I would repeat a thousand times over that you are more then dear more than precious to me the Paper does not blush though I do but that you see not nor that inborn Modesty so hard to be dispens'd with which were you even here before me would make me a ve  Woman and deny all I have this way said to you nay th  Night I last saw you in my Closet when I and my Passion both strove to rid our selves of it when I was upon the Point of losing you for ever without a Sally on my side to favour your Presumption and dying at that Loss yet could I make nothing of it though by the kind Encouragement of my Eyes you ventured at what you guess'd a pleasing Kiss with pleasure I could have clasp'd you to my Bosom by a dear Embrace to have imprinted our cruel parting in your Memory Yet left I you almost where I found you though I once had resolved before you went to tell you insinuately and indirectly but so as any Man not stupid might have known that 'twas you alone could make all my Happiness  LETTER IV  I'VE so lately seen you and my Thoughts are so fill'd with that dear Image that I can't forbear telling you though at this distance That Fancy has brought you near nay so very near as to my Bosom there this Morning I dream'd you were and the Imagination was so strong that starting out of my sleep I left my Dream imperfect my Senses had their Concern been less had not so soon roused themselves to find whether the Object were a real or imaginary Happiness And I perhaps had longer seen you nay I more than saw you forgive the Pleasure I take in writing freely and let me instruct you in the Laws of Love which say There can be no Indecency in vertuous Love 'tis Generosity 'tis Kindness and unless you love not me I can't offend Be my Letters the Test of your Passion if they are acceptable I must be so nor think I should dislike you for your Inconstancy to another I've already told you you can only offend by indifferency Should I not cherish that Inconstancy Should I not be proud of the Exchange I am and of your Kindness which I hope real because I deserve it should be so You seem to doubt of the continuance of mine and think it burns too fierce to last It would indeed be the greatest Happiness for me for sure a hopeless distant Passion is of all things the most miserable State My whole Endeavours strove Reason Pride Modesty in short all the Powers of haughty Womankind inflam'd to the height with an Opinion of her own Worth not to have let you seen when here the Disorder you had made but in vain I would too have forbid my self the Ease of complaining upon Paper but the Rack was too exquisite Selflove carried it above all other Considerations  and I push'd my Fortune in hopes of succeeding How then do you think I should now do less when I have the pleasing Prospect of a mutual Passion Do not believe me weary of the Pursuit at least till I arrive at that charming Intelligence of Heart which leaves us nothing farther to desire than indeed they say we may be suspected to decline because Human Nature is in it self restless and loves alteration But being yet at a vast distance from the Cause alarm not your self in fear of the Effects especially where there is not the least Symptoms of such a Change Therefore if you can love me boldly love me without Fears of my Inconstancy or any Dispondency of your own Merit Talk no more at that displeasing Distance let me not find you think your self undeserving of the worthiest Heart for that seems a secret upbraiding of my Choice If you must fear fear only that Fortune may for a long time delay our mutual Pleasure of seeing each other if ever I am so happy I'll infuse into your Soul so vast a Profusion of Tenderness that your self shall own could be only inspired by me then you will say your whole Life has pass'd insipidly without the greatest most transporting and most valuable Gift of Nature and no where to be found but in Hearts mutually loving and knowing how to be belov'd yet  granting a mighty difference in the understanding of the Persons the more sensible the Love doubtless 'tis the most capable of those Delights whose description is too big for words and which only the Lover's Fancy can do justice to  I am sorry I can give you no more Particulars of this Amour for I durst not press the Prince to declare whether he were marry'd or only promis'd I believe the former However he did not long enjoy her Beauty but returning to  Germany  was sent to treat upon Secrets of  State with the King of  England  whose Death succeeding soon after broke for some time the Prince of  Hesse  's Measures so he retir'd to  Greenwich  to pass over  incognito  the Grief he really took for his Loss 'Twas there that I first had the Honour of his Acquaintance my ill Health obliging me to take the Air in hopes of my Recovery I had not then ever seen his Highness nor in some years my Cousin  Nugent  The ViceRoys of  Catalonia  have it in their Power to create whom they please Noble The Prince had had the Goodness to make him a Count during his Residence in  Spain  I met 'em both in the  Park  and did not fail to congratulate and welcom my Cousin into  England  I ask'd him who that Foreigner was that I saw with him Not imagining it to be the Prince because they had not one Attendant and  Nugent  wore his Hat and treated him but as his Equal he invited me to their little Lodging at  Greenwich  which indeed was very small nor had they any more than one Servant that waited without a Livery I speak most of the Modern Languages and the Prince did me the Honour to be pleas'd with my Conversation nay so far as to discover himself to me and I persuaded him back to Court to apply himself to the Ministers who probably would pursue the Method the King had before his Death resolv'd upon for the next Campaign the Queen graciously receiv'd him and in consultation with Count  Wratislaw  the  Emperor  's  Envoy  it was resolv'd according to King  William  's Intentions that the Prince of  Hesse  should be sent to  Portugal  to endeavour to draw that King from his Neutrality into the Alliance Before things could be fix'd for his Departure the Prince met with several Interruptions travers'd by the Pensioners  of  France  for there are but few Negotiations secret in the Court of  England  the Delays were so uneasy that it put him upon a superstitious piece of Weakness and which indeed was his blind side of hearing what  Astrologers  and  Fortunetellers  would tell him  Nugent  had procur'd him several among which one ignorant dirty Creature in  White friars  a Month before his Departure told him that he should not go till the next Month that he should receive his Dispatch the Sixteenth depart the Seventeenth but if he could stay till the Eighteenth his Voyage would have success but withal said he should never come to  England  again I must believe that  Nugent  had a hand in her Intelligence for according to what she said the Prince receiv'd his Orders on the Sixteenth and went the Seventeenth the Joy and Eagerness he had to have surmounted all those Difficulties that had retarded his Voyage got the better of his Superstition and would not let him wait for the Eighteenth which he afterwards repented when he failed of what he had proposed for the King of  Portugal  gave him his  Congee  without hearkning to any of his Proposals or the Reasons he offer'd to draw him into the Alliance The Prince refus'd the Presents that the King sent after him on board his Ship and departed with all the Chagrin of a disappointed Courtier whose own Interest as surely it was his to serve  Spain  was equally defeated he join'd the Squadron where the Duke of  Ormond  was They resolved upon a Descent at  Barcelona  the Prince depending upon his Intelligence with the Citizens and the great Love the People had for him since his being ViceRoy in  Catalonia  but their Designs were discovered and for that time disappointed They afterwards fell in at  Vigo  with all that Success which it will be superfluous to repeat to you Here he found means to receive new Proofs of the Princess's Kindness with a passionate Letter too long for me to Copy full of smiling Hopes that Fortune would shortly unite their Persons as it had done their Hearts  He return'd to  England  with the Duke of  Ormond  and was very well receiv'd at Court notwithstanding the Disappointments he had met with and the Mortification he had not long after of seeing one of the Queen's Servants succeed in what he had fail'd the King of  Portugal  was drawn into the Alliance and the Prince's Hopes were still fairer than before he still maintain'd his Intelligence with the  Catalonians  and the Court believ'd so well of it as to resolve to send a Fleet and Army to attend him under the Command of the Earl of  Peterborough  Notwithstanding the Prince's Glorious Affair with the Princess of  he found it not amiss at his leisure hours to unbend himself with the fair English Ladies his Soul was Passionate his Temper Amorous and Sweet he pretended not to be one of those Hero's of  Romance  that can subsist upon the bare Imagination of an absent Mistress and who think it a Crime deserving Death should they bestow the least Glance upon another The Prince's Person and Goodwill was at the Service of any fair Lady he liv'd in Splendor lavish'd away his Money for his generous Temper like Mareschal  Turenne  consider'd not the value of it this gave him Choice enough among the Ladies that were to be purchas'd with whom he amus'd himself tho' his Inclinations were all devoted to my Lord  W  's Lady but want of Leisure and believing her already engaged hinder'd his Application  tho' he made his Court Regularly to her as indeed all the Foreigners do Her living so long in the Court of  France  and being Daughter to a King has given her Conversation that easy turn and Freedom as makes it very entertaining to all that love the Honour of Conversing with her  You must have heard of his known Amour with a reputed Daughter of the Duke of  Monmouth  a Lady who has had the Honour of Pleasing the first and then the greatest Elector of the Empire he had also an intrigue with the  Miss  of a Gentleman of your Acquaintance who is since dead The Prince had been lost for two or three Nights an affair of Consequence happning I was upon the necessary hunt to impart it to him and was directed to a little blind Lodging in  Soho  where I was told his Highness was incognito with  Ph  ts  Mistress The Woman of the House happned to be of my Acquaintance and whilst the Prince was rising Entertain'd me below in her Parlour with the good Fortune and Honour she receiv'd by his Consummating his Nuptials at her worthless House I ask'd her how his Quality came to be discover'd she conjur'd me to Secresy and told me her  Hoyness  had her self trusted her with it and that she was sure it must be so For she as well as the Prince wore the Order of the Golden Fleece about her Neck and had promis'd she shou'd attend her  Hoyness  into  Germany  in Quality of first Lady of her BedChamber be her Lady  Malborough  That she was a vast Fortune and one of the Coheiresses of the late Earl of  Gainsborough  I laught heartily at the Woman  s Relation of the Quality of her  Hoyness  and told her as a Friend that I doubted she wou  d not get much Honour by keeping such a  Hoyness  in her  House that to my Knowledge she was no other than a poor PawnBroker's Daughter up two pair of Stairs in  StanhopeStreet  till  Ph  t  Debauch'd or at least took her for she had been amongst  Rich  's Players before since when her Mother was remov'd into  LeicesterFields  and kept a House of fair Reception for who pleas'd to lodge there My good Acquaintance who was really an honest Woman flew out into extream Bitterness against me How not a Princess Impossible she came home last Night from sitting for her Picture drest like a Shepherdess and her fine Diamond Necklace broke as she was running up Stairs and she cry'd out every Diamond was worth above an Hundred Pound Oh 'tis an inestimable Necklace the  Prince  had plunder'd it from  Vigo  I bid her take care of what she said against the Princes Honour in that Particular 'twas enough how Innocent soever to bring him before the Council who sat upon the Examination of what was plunder'd that I was sure he had a Soul too Great to be guilty of any such thing She still urg'd the Necklace and as matter of fact produc'd one of the Diamonds that had bin found that Morning as they clean'd the House I presently saw how it was for indeed she had borrow'd it with a Crook Scrip Hat and other Shepherd's Accoutrements from the PlayHouse This undeceiv'd my Friend and made her confess that before she thought her  Hoyness  very wild and very vain and now she found her very bragging  That  I told her was as natural to her as lying For when  Ph  t  had her first she past at their Lodging for Sr  Guilford Medcalfs  's Daughter deceas'd LordMayor of  York  and a Fortune of Twenty Thousand Pounds that 'twas usual for her to entertain one Man with the Account of how many others  had caress'd her and if by chance she happned into the Acquaintance of any Woman civiler than her self she wou'd asperse them to her Fellows for having debauch'd and put her to Bed to this Lord and that Duke and of mixing Brandy in her Wine and intoxicating her so that she did not know what she did Oh she'll drink like a Fish answer'd the good Landlady she had several strong rich Waters for her Mornings Draught has slept her self Sober three times in a day in my House and her excuse is that her  Hoyness  is going into a cold Country and must use her self to it or else she shall be laughed at where all perpetually drink and never are disorder'd with it Here the Prince came to us and I found him a little out of Countenance at my seeing him there we went away together I gave him the Character of his Mistress He confess'd he was tir'd of her Vanity and Folly and which was worse began to fear some disorder in his Health but I fansie it no ill Scene to see my Friend dismissing her  Hoyness  from her Lodging and reproaching her for the Scandal she had brought upon her House I have dwelt too long upon these Fooleries and yet I took 'em but as an introduction to a Greater What the Fortunetelling Woman in  WhiteFriars  had told the Prince of his Mistress carrying on the Affair he was then going about confirm'd him in the Opinion that they had a supernatural Knowledge tho' she had fail'd in that particular of his coming to  England  again Somebody that he was repeating it too told him that there was one Mrs  Mason  in  WhiteChappel  that was a perfect Witch he presently ask'd 'em if they had ever seen her They said no nor did not intend it for tho' the silly vulgar reputed her a Witch they did not believe God  had given that Power to any The Prince perswaded two of 'em to go incognito with him and at least hear what she cou'd say They yielded to oblige him and in a Hackney Coach to  HarrowAlley  away they go The Prince was a Man that seldom made an Appearance as to Dress and that day was as plain as possible They came to the blind Alley on that side that goes into  GoodmansFields  where they left the Coach and walkt into the Alley till they came to a little AleHouse where upon a Board it was written that Mrs  Mason  the FortuneTeller liv'd there up two pair of Stairs They were carried into a dirty dining Room enjoyning themselves Silence least they shou'd be overheard and their own Words repeated to 'em as Prophesy after half an Hours waiting they were shown into a Closet where Mrs  Mason  sat to attend 'em 'twas so small the Prince repos'd himself upon a dirty pair of Stairs that went up thence into a Garret Her manner is to ask no Questions but taking the Persons two Hands together looks carefully in 'em and then falls to telling as fast as she can the past the present and the future this I'm sure off she cou'd have no Intelligence of who the Prince was nor his Design for themselves knew it not but just as they went about it After she had dispatch'd the Ladies the Prince took the Chair and sat before the Witch when she had look'd into his Hands she told him she did not know what to say to him He ask'd her why She answer'd because he shou'd be something greater than ever she had seen they laugh'd at her mistake she proceeded to tell him there was a certain great and very fair Lady that wou'd make his Fortune if he liv'd but two Years longer and that he shou'd be easy for the rest of his Days  die old and in his Bed but that an Eminent Danger threaten'd him either by Fire or Water In two Years the malevolence of his evil Destiny wou'd be past that he had already escaped several hazards one with a Sword in his Thigh another with a shot in his Head and once Drowning  c  The Prince in returning from the Witch was very Melancholy and told the Ladies that it was true he had actually receiv'd two such Wounds pull'd back his Perriwig and shew'd where the Musketball went into his Head and worked out at his Neck They laugh'd at the Prediction yet one of 'em was so far inclin'd to believe that she resolved to try her again and taking a Friend with her that never had heard of Mrs  Mason  they chang'd Cloaths with their Chamber Maids and went to her she apply'd her self to the Servants of the Mistresses and told 'em Fortunes accordingly and to the Lady who had been there before whom she did not know again quite contrary to what she had said when she was there with the Prince which inevitably shows us that she has no other Inspiration but a random Guess which sometimes hits but a thousand times oftner misses unless it were that Heav'n who takes more than a common Care of Hero's put into this ignorant Woman's Mouth Words proper for the Subject and by Superstition fitting him to believe gave him warning to be wary how for two Years he continu'd to expose himself But Love and Glory calling him he hearkn'd not to any presages of his evil Destiny tho' almost a Miracle was shown for I reckon it a remote one that Mrs  Mason  shou'd happen upon the right Places where he was wounded nay tho' he believ'd all that she said as he has often assur'd me and that his Blood was adust and  melancholy with that belief yet negligent of the Warning he had receiv'd in hopes of being for ever Happy in the Arms of his Beauteous Queen he rush'd thro' Clouds of Fire and Smoke at the Siege of  Barcelona  to the fatal Assault where he was laid dead by the Shot of a thousand Muskets and all his hopes of Ambition and Love buried in that glorious Ruin Yet shall his Memory survive amongst the Mourning  Catalonians  who unfeignedly lamented his Death it was indeed a Blow to  Charles  the Third of  Austria  he lost a Man of considerable Interest in that part of  Spain  and one whom the Dowagers favour render'd considerable at Court for however all things were manag'd by the  French  Faction there were several of the Grandees continu'd faithful to the House of  Austria  by the wise Management of that charming Queen It is only permitted us to guess at the Princess's Sorrow or rather Despair at the Death of her  Hero  she who so diligently had lov'd and caus'd to be brought to  Plymouth  a little before his departure a Present to the value of Forty thousand Pound in Money Plate and Jewels for his use without doubt she is inconsolable I am sorry for your sake that I have no means of being inform'd of what so great a Queen said and acted at the loss of her Lover possibly one day I may oblige you with some particulars if Prince  Henry  of  Hesse D'armstadt  Prince  George  's Brother who went to  Barcelona  with him ever return to  England  We may hence comfort our selves at our Misfortunes when little Miseries befall us to think the Great and Glorious are no more exempt than the meanest Mortal Human Vicissitudes are as natural as to Breath and seldom does Happiness settle in a point but varying as the Compass with only Snatches and sudden  Gusts visits her greatest Favourites but by Moments whilst Miseries slow and solemn take State and where they once appear will not be dispossest with Ease This Prince was by Nature perfectly Great and Good he shou'd have wore a Crown for an Example of Generosity and Vertue to reigning Kings There wanted but six Weeks when he was kill'd of the Prediction of two Years being elapsed I can dwell no longer on this mournful Subject but beg leave to assure you however abruptly I may end that I am most devoutly  Madam  Your most obedient and most humble Servant  I forgot to tell you Mrs  Mason  is very Rich but as she had her Rise in that dirty Alehouse she foresees by her Art that the Spirit of Divination will depart from her when ever she forsakes it so that the Inspiration lies in the place  c  LETTER IV  Being an Account of an Amour of a young Widow of the Town and two Gallants Mr  C  of  D  and Mr  S  J    I Have no Entertainment for you Dear Sir  James  that can quit the Trouble of Reading my Letters were they properly my own Therefore I seek supply from a richer Fountain rather than leave you undiverted The Fair little Widow that cou'd charm you in her Cypress a Dress ominous to a Lover less daring has shew'd us that she was to be taken tho' not by your Battery For yours was not the murd'ring Cannon that nowadays does all the execution Vows and Oaths going for little The powerfull'st God is glittering Gold which our Friend Mr  C  very well understands and therefore apply'd himself that way to our Widow and by whispering false Hopes to the Governour got possession of the Town as I understand the Story he had given in to her Proposals Money to carry on her LawSuit But whether her Charms did not answer his Expectations or that he be of Sir  Charles Sidley  's Opinion in his  Bellamira  That  'tis no Sin to cousin Them that cousin the World  he did not fail to baulk the Lady's Expectations and Heroically to stand the brunt of an amorous Dun The Letters hapning by a secret way to fall into my hands I have transcrib'd 'em for you to read in your LimeTreeWalk when you are barren of a better Entertainment I can assure you that they are Matter of Fact and literally true  Her First LETTER to Mr  C  To desire the Loan of some Money on the Promise of which he had been happy  IN your Arms I forgot all my Misfortunes and the Business of our Acquaintance but am awaked by approaching Ruin from that pleasing Dream My Lawyer is such an Infidel that nothing but  Miracles  can convince him and  Money  is such to me at this time In short I lose the Term without it and have no prospect but starving out the rest of my life after The Writ is ready all but Sealing yet he won't suffer it to be done till his Bill be discharged Think if I am worth that Generosity and spare me the Confusion of speaking which 'tis much easier for me to want than do If I pass  Wednesday  Morning the whole Term is lost to me and I may then be counted amongst those things that were and are no more  Mr  C  lov'd his Money too well to admit of either Compassion for the Fair or Justice to his own Promise he thought fit to leave this Letter unanswer'd But over a Glass of Wine when the Linen was taken away after Dinner at  Mr S J  's House he did not fail to divert him with the Adventure shew'd him the Letter and ingeniously prided himself in deceiving her Mr  S  J  ask'd him If he wou'd not take it ill if he endeavour'd to succeed him in the Lady's favour Mr  C  gave him Liberty of Conscience to say and write what he thought fit By this means the Widow became acquainted with her Misfortune and how cruelly Mr  C  had exposed her and her Letter She thereupon thought fit to send him this second Epistle with an intent to have made him asham'd of his telling her Secret  Her Second LETTER to the same  To thank him for a Bill of Two hundred Pounds but sent by another  YOƲ have found the handsomest way in the World to oblige me for however you disguised the Hand the Directions that came to me this Morning by the PenyPost with a  BankBill  of Two hundred Guineas must come from you for I had ask'd nor obliged no body else or  re Mr  S  J  was not so Gallant If you did not oblige me your self I desire you will ask him if he did But why shou'd I be so vain to think of a person that had not receiv'd the least Civility from me No it must be you and I am all on fire to thank you in the best manner it has I hope sav'd my Cause I'm sure paid my Lawyers and may give me Four hundred Pound a year judge then of the Obligation I have to you if ever I live to recover my Estate you shall certainly be paid in kind for that is the least I can do to my Benefactor In the mean time send me word when we shall meet at Mrs  T  's 'Tis a long while methinks since  Sunday  Night I shall now see you with double pleasure that is to say with Gratitude as well as Love  His LETTER to the fair Widow  Assuring her he sent her no Bill nor ever was so expensive in his Pleasures  HAD not my Hopes of being my own Ambassadour rather than this Paper made me defer it from Hour to Hour I had e're now Madam congratulated with you upon the  unusual  Goodness of the World and at the same time approv'd my self not so  vain as to accept of Praises not at all my due I am by Nature a  Sceptick  and doubtful of all things  past  and to  come  and therefore shou'd have been as uncertain in this as all other things But naming the Sum I quickly found it cannot be I who have not the Tenth part of that to spare nor wou'd the  Indies  supply me if the Mite I offer to every Inclination were of such a piece of Paper How extraordinary a thing is it to receive unknown Obligations in this World Therefore sure it cannot be but the Magnificent will follow the present and some Rich  Sultan Banker  has declared you his Favorite and espoused you his  Sultana  And methinks I see you already Triumphant in the midst of your Slaves where the most unworthy is even my Envy So far does Love exceed all else in Dignity as well as Power that whilst the greatest Monarchs most favorite Slaves look vile to every impartial Eye the Chains of Love add Honour to all that wear 'em Therefore I make it my Petition and 'tis all my Ambition to bear a Link or two of your Chains amongst the  many  For tho' there may be more deserving there can be none more faithful  Her Third LETTER  A Banter upon Mr  C  for his exposing her Necessities  THis is prodigious Modesty in you to deny all pretence to an Obligation which I'm convinc'd if not immediately yet collaterally proceeds from you Nor let me forget to congratulate that  unbounded  Inclination of yours to which I owe such  substantial  Joys as are beyond the Power of Fate to recall and which you all  Sceptick  as you are cannot so far overact your part as to doubt of what you've felt is past nay the present Things are beyond dispute For when with extream Gratitude and Honour you had to your  Friends condol'd the Incapacity of that little  Indies  of yours which had been so profusely lavisht to every Inclination that scarce the Tenth part remain'd to oblige a  fond young believing undone  Woman who had thrown her self upon your Generosity trusting to your Promises and Offers The Rumour catch'd from your kind aloud complaining Voice run from one to another where you had taken care to spread it till at length it rested in the Breast of an Old  Magnifico  whose Heart is large as his Possessions tho' his Years exceeding both He first appear'd to me in the shape of a  BankBill  and as you guessed quickly after in his own you may imagin prepossess'd as my Heart was with your  faithful Image  which was the most welcom tho' from him I receiv'd the Obligation yet to you I owe it since had you not tho' your self unable to relieve with small seven thousand Pound a year complain'd to others of my wants I still had been a silent sufferer How worthily can I think you my noble Benefactor How enough to the World shall I proclaim your Generosity and Honour How reward so Magnificent a Bounty What  Vandike  shall I employ to tell with his admirable Pencil succeeding Ages how generous you how grateful I Let me high on a Throne be drawn with all that glittering Wealth about me you have so well described whilst you rais'd equal to me in Vanity in Pride and Pleasures free from the least Link of that Chain you speak of shall employ all my Thoughts with Eyes languishing and Hands pointing to that shining Store about us shall seem to say all this I owe to you For had you not in kind compassion told my secret I had not thus been bless'd  Fame Honour Discretion Secrecy  and a thousand other ridiculous Vertues shall disappear before us Luxurious Love shall tell all our Hours to us whilst in pleasure our five Senses shall be improved to fifty▪ Thus may you ever flourish thus ever live and your Years prove immortal as your Merits  Thus my dear Baronet have I endeavour'd to divert you with two Letters that are I'm sure in their kinds Originals I'll leave you to make  what Reflections you please upon the Wit and Sincerity of either the last admits of no dispute in me when it pretends to the Title of Sir  Your most faithful and most humble Servant  LETTER V  From a Lady to a Lady being an Account of her own Adventures and Loss of her Lovers  YES my Dear my Evervalu'd Friend you shall here know all that my poor tortur'd Soul has suffer'd in these long cruel three Years separation Have I one spark of Joy remaining in my Soul Your Letter brought it forth and tho' dead to Hope and lost to Happiness or ev'n wish of Happiness I find still a pleasure in being esteem'd by you Oh  Clorinda  in other Loves there is no Constancy even Friendship to me is but insipid fit only to amuse a Soul unfeeling a more exalted Heat Had our Sex been different I fear my Dear by this we had forgot to Love or perhaps have learnt to Hate Tho' that's a Passion so Foreign to my Mind that as yet I am ignorant of what it means My Soul rebounds not at an Injury engross'd by softer Passions it has no room to entertain so rough a Guest  You ask me the meaning of that melancholy Strain that runs through all my Letters and conjure me to explain my self with Friendship You well remember me that when we parted I was envy'd by most and by all thought happy 'Tis true I had not suffer'd Shipwrack then but since Oh what have I not endur'd Will you have patience to hear a three years Anguish 'Tis all dark a melancholy Gloom my gayer Genius is fled and lost in its Shades I'm the Reverse of what I was no more the Pleasure of the World the Delight of Conversation no more  belov'd  yet still  loving  Is there a Misery beyond this Is there a Rack in Nature I have not felt May I not well complain But to give you in particular my Misfortunes You left me in the possession of a Heart worthy mine but the World and Interest divided us An Eminent LawSuit ruin'd my Lover's Fortune in which part of mine was involv'd and left him no hopes of repairing it but by a Wife more Rich than I cou'd be The coming  Term  was to take him in Execution for a Sum too mighty for him to struggle with This was kept a Secret from me for fear of my Disquiets At length finding him excessive melancholy and dejected beyond what I cou'd ever have suspected from his Fortitude of Soul he told me his Misfortunes That he was undone but his own Sorrows were inconsiderable to him in comparison of mine He was indeed by Promise by Vows and Inclination my Husband But shou  d I call him to the performance we both were lost and must expect to languish out the rest of his life in Prison oppress'd with Misery and Wants That such a Lady had been offer'd him for a Wife considerable in her Fortune and so destitute of Charms that it could not give me the least Suspicion that Inconstancy had any part in what was his only Refuge the last Pla  k that could preserve him from Shipwreck I took Time to weigh and examine the Truth of what he said but was soon convinced of his ill Circumstances and could not suffer my Heart to hesitate a moment on what it should do to save him the Thoughts were death to me that for my sake he should live poor contemn'd and wretched I concluded that tho' like other Men he might prove ungrateful 'twas a more tolerable Evil than having him through my means unfortunate Let all who have not generous  Souls as I suppose they will condemn me for what they may call Weakness But sure  Clorinda  does better know how to value so unpresidented a Sacrifice I gave up all my Happiness to his Interest and by Permission saw him three Weeks after marry'd Indeed Misfortunes in prospect are only guess'd at they are not to be describ'd till felt tho' I had prepar'd my self for all that could be expected of Sufferings yet when once I began to feel the real Load I sunk under 'em since he was safe and happy no matter what became of me neither Honour nor Policy would permit his Visits for his Engagements with me had been no secret his Lady would soon have heard of 'em and consequently have had her own and his Pleasure poison'd that way Besides I was resolved to put an end to a Flame that could not now burn with Innocence I gave my self up to the Diversions of the World Visits Cards Plays all that ought to divert the Mind  my Love was to suffer a violent Death since it would not resign to a natural but in vain it withstood the Essorts of Reason Diversions Duty it mock'd all my Endeavours and augmenting by Resistance threw me into a violent Illness out of which I did not but after much danger recover the Pain was at my Heart which the Physicians had no Cure for Then it was my  Clorinda  that with the rest of the World you heard the Report of my death and truly I was so near it that it was the work of ten Months before I could stand alone or under my own hand give you to know I was not yet so happy as to be Nothing They remov'd me into the Country to try their last Experiment the change of Air By the Time of my return back to  London  almost two Years had pass'd since that  fatal Marriage My Heart still engag'd still tortur'd by a Love which I could not perswade my self to be Criminal because I once had a Right and Title to his Love though when I consider'd my self had releas'd all Pretences I doubly blamed my Heart for persevering but Love is a Power too mighty for us to controul I saw my Murderer and my old Wounds bleed afresh at the fatal Sight he complained of his own want of Happiness and secretly pleas'd my Heart by finding if his Grief were less his Satisfaction was not more How insignificant a Relief is this How is it that a Power so mighty as Love can be serv'd and find its account in Trifles He complain'd that Marriage had not answer'd his End for though it sav'd him from impending Ruin in his LawSuit and discharg'd his Execution yet many other of his Debts being unpaid gave him much uneasiness That his Lady like a right Widow had secur'd the greatest part of her Fortune to her own use their Humours were extreamly different and he had little Hopes of prevailing on hers because he wanted the first Principles that should give his their agrecable Motion she lov'd Flattery as most Ladies do and he was not Master of it he had almost said of Kindness too In short he was too dangerous for my Conversation his Eyes had still the same Beauty his Words their usual Softness and I think a certain melancholy Air heightned all his Charms should I dwell on every Circumstance the Conversation must tire you in a word I tore my self from these Enchantments and forbid my Heart such Criminal Delights Yet my Torment pursu'd me wheresoever I fled I had once more recourse to the Country and went by Recommendation  to Board in  Bristol  at a Gentleman's House who with his Family were all Strangers to me A Chronick Distemper which my Melancholy had contracted could only expect its Cure from change of Air The Family I was receiv'd into consisted of an old wellnatur'd Gentleman govern'd by his spleenetick Wife who had as much Cunning as Nature alone could give her and had her Education been good her Wit might have been more considerable They had formerly merchandiz'd but being pretty easy in the World had lately left off A Brother of hers liv'd in the Family who had been bred up with them in their Way he appear'd to me as a Person well made and handsome but perfectly unfashion'd having had no Conversation but Business who declin'd Women's Company and rarely ever spoke among the Men he seldom  at home and I believe I was near seven Months in the House with him before we had any Conversation tho' you know me easy of Access and pleas'd with Company my business was to s  ck Diversion which my ill Health had made perfectly necessary to me An ugly unmarried Maid of Thirty a Sister of theirs brought up the Rear of this goodly Family and here in reading and conversing with some of the Town who visited Mrs  Woudbe  which you must know is my Landlady's Name I pass'd a considerable Time the Poison still at my Heart daily wasting by a consuming hopeless Fire what would I not have done for my Cure How was I alone of all human kind plagn'd with a never dying Passion I had read indeed that Inconstancy was counted the greatest Weakness of the weakest Sex but here I imagin'd it would have been meritorious for there can be no Appeal  from Marriage that certainly ought to destroy all precedent Inclinations and they must be unpardonable who preserve theirs after it  At length another Brother the 'Squire of Mrs  Woudbe  's Family came upon a Visit to  Bristol  he dress'd at the Ladies had seen some of the World was half bred as to Gallantry and about that pitch in Understanding but good Natur'd and a very honest Gentleman what his Brother wanted in Tongue he supply'd and 'twas not his fault if Conversation languish'd his kind Endeavours would relieve it though sometimes at the Expence of his Reputation as to Wit For 'tis very hard for great Talkers always to escape Impertinence Mr  Peregrine Worthy  was his Name he quickly told me that his Heart had been mortgag'd above these two Years to a young Lady passionately fond of him but he was one whom her Father would not permit her to marry because his Estate did not answer the Fortune he could give her He was not so young as his Brother by six Years nor so well shaped but much more polish'd and it came into my Head by a malicious Diversion to make him in Love with me notwithstanding his Engagement It seem'd  erable that any other Woman should be qui  Possessor of the Heart she lov'd whilst I was so unhappy to be depriv'd of what I had adored The general ill Opinion I had of all Mens Constancy made me conclude I should have no great trouble in conquering  Peregrine  's I look'd not at the Consequence nor had debated with my self what to do with that Toy his Heart or that Lumber his Person were they once made an Offering to me What I wanted was present Amusement for as Poisons are said to expel Poisons I would with all my Heart have lov'd any Thing to put  out of my mind the Phantom that haunted me But this was not the Diamond that was to cut mine for tho' we enter'd into a Commerce of Gallantry and after his departure writ Letters as mutually tender as if we had been really touch'd I suppose we both remain'd unwounded by each other All I know of my side is that my former Passion found not the least abatement and therefore 'tis easy to conclude a new one did not succeed At length young  Worthy  fell so ill that his Life was for some time in danger Mrs  Woudbe  had Business call'd her to  London  after she was gone I debated with my self whether I should be so illnatur'd to let a Brother of the Family where I was die and never give him a Visit I knew he did not love Company and least of all Ladies but my good Manners and good Nature overruling I resolved to do my Duty though it should prove unacceptable I came to his Bedside and had a much civiller Reception than I expected the heighth of his Distemper as I then supposed had master'd his Native Roughness I found him in a violent Fever and having too lately had an expensive Experience of what Physicians could do I was able to advise him in many things proper for the Recovery of his Health Had Mrs  Woudbe  been there I should not have attempted it for she has that Quality peculiar to her self to believe none besides her self knowing in any thing and that she is ignorant of nothing Mrs  Abigal  the Surly her Sister of Thirty dull and heavy in make as well as Understanding was his chief Nurse I had Compassion for him in the ill hands he was in and therefore failed not to be often with him which he seem'd to receive very civilly his Fever abated but his Temper being melancholy  the Distemper had so seiz'd his Spirits that I found it must be a powerful Diversion of the Mind that could be able to throw it thence but whence it should proceed I could not guess to a Man wholly free from Vice or Passions I found his Understanding very good what he did speak proper and well imagin'd and I doubted not but he would shew us he had Wit enough could he once dispence with Custom and Modesty that had hitherto kept him silent We read to him Books of Wit and Gallantry I found he had a true Taste of things and could commend in the right place thus a sort of Satisfaction succeeded Compassion and I felt my self better pleased in his Company than I imagin'd I could have been We grew acquainted his Conversation became free and genteel we chanced to talk of  Love  he protested he never knew what the least Spark of it meant and my Judgment was he never would not considering that Nature makes nothing in vain however a defect of Constitution might happen I talk'd of the  Language of the Eyes  he innocently protested he knew not what I meant by that neither could he imagine Nay was more and more confounded when I told him  Lovers Eyes could talk  he assured me he never minded the difference of Glances he thought all Eyes had the same Looks tho' not the same Colour This was wonderful I thought from one who had himself the finest I ever saw and a very bad encouragement for me if I had had the least design upon his Heart tho' in jest as before with his Brother He liked my Company or my Library or both so well that after he was up and dress'd he never was from us I suted him with the gay part of reading being properest to remove his Melancholy We  chanced one day to light upon  Brown  's Translation of  Fontenel  's and  Aristaenetus  's Letters he seem'd mightily pleas'd with 'em there was one from a Lady who permits a Lover all but the last Favour and gives him leave to touch her Breast to kiss her Eyes her Mouth and squeeze her with her Stays off he could not imagine what Pleasure could be taken in that Not long after we were returning with Mistress  Abigal  late from a Visit out of Town where we had been merrily entertain'd and had all three contrary to Custom drank enough to elevate us  Bacchus  is counted a Friend to Love after putting me into the Coach young  Worthy  staid not for Compliments with Mrs  Abigal  but threw himself with a Gaiety wholly new to him on the Seat by me 'twas dark and tho' the surly Maid was our Opposite in the Humour we were all in it pass'd for Raillery He pretended to make the Lady's Experiment of squeezing since he found I had only a MorningWastcoat on thence he attempted to kiss my Cheek then my Lips and if I'm not mistaken could no longer wonder where the Pleasure was of  That  After we came home we continued the Frolick sitting upon Mrs  Abigal  's Bed he sighed after every Kiss no ill Omen of a Heart touch'd with Pleasure I may truly protest to you that for Nine successive Years that I had been tormented with an unintermitting Passion this was the only Moment that I first found it suspended I confess I was then lost to any Thoughts but the present there his Eyes first gave and knew the distinction of Looks he could no longer boast of Ignorance they had a Softness wholly new so full of sparkling Fire so Tender nay so Passionate that I catched the Distemper into mine and look'd on his with  an uncommon Pleasure you may perhaps too nicely blame me for giving into those Delights but I was suddenly betray'd by one from whom I never expected any danger and therefore could not arm my self against it I was also charm'd with thinking my self the first that gave him Wishes that gave him Desire and Joy that Heart that formerly insensible Heart seem'd no longer so to me I was pleas'd to encourage a Pleasure that destroy'd my former Pain and I found young  Worthy  had in an hour done more towards my Cure than all my own whole two Years endeavour Mrs  Abigal  thought our Conversation something too Tender the Wine working out in ill Nature with her as in Kindness with us she was impertinent enough to have offended us had she been worth it After this when he found me alone he would sometimes pretend to the Pleasure of a Kiss but never declar'd himself so that I believed my self mistaken when I reckon'd upon my Conquest He took occasion to be always with me we read we walk'd we eat together but still not a word of Love he became unimaginably improv'd like  Cymon  for  Iphigenia  in the Fable he dress'd he discours'd he no longer avoided the Ladies Company All the World wonder'd at the Change he became genteel as any Body and appear'd with as good an Air I told you at first that he was perfectly wellshap'd to me they attributed these Improvements calling him my Scholar my Pain was inverted from  London  to the Country I would have given all the World to hear his Mouth confirm what his Eyes so often told me What Laws What Manners What Customs have our Sex How must we be Tantaliz'd How Tortur'd Why was it not permitted to search his Heart Why  not to ask him if yet he knew whether there was a Deity call'd  Love  Our perpetual Opportunities our long Converse might have well excus'd it but Modesty overrul'd even Curiosity and Vanity I was forced to suffer in Uncertainty and Silence Thus a whole Year run on since that Moment he first began to make an Impression upon my Heart At length amidst the pleasing Liberty of unnumber'd Kisses he brought out with doubting Modesty that transporting word  I love you  I could have swore that till that minute I never knew what Joy what Pleasure was I could not stay for Reflection I could not speak I more than spoke I hug'd him in an extatick manner more Charming more Intelligible than a Thousand words You have known my dear  Clorinda  the Force of Love wonder not then that thus in me he exerted his Tyrannick Sway or think the Person I've describ'd because lower than my self in Rank unworthy of my Heart his was by inclination Noble and  Dryden  who so well knew the Passions tells us  Love either finds Equality or makes it  Like Death he knows no difference in degrees  But plains and levels all  After that he would perhaps have no longer scrupled to speak his Passion but our Opportunities of being alone were few what was now no Secret to me was long since by his Actions suspected by the Family Mrs  Woudbe  and Mrs  Abigal  were our perpetual Companions nay we had an additional Spy a Friend of Mrs  Woudbe  's that was received there upon some Misfortunes of her Husband This was a Damsel that pretended to Airs and Charms would ogle my Lover and whether  by their desires or her own Inclinations attempted to have made a diversion of his Kindness She offer'd at so many Advances that my jealous Eyes called 'em unpardonable However her Charms were no way dangerous and I believe I need have given my self no pain that way This Creature won upon my easy Nature by her Assiduities and she us'd often to rally at Mrs  Woudbe  's fears for her Brother Thus were we interrupted in the full Course of our Amour and 'twas impossible to speak without being overheard one or both of the Sisters were perpetually upon the hearken It was not so when any other Company was with me for I had a ridiculous Pretender or two out of the Town which had not my Heart been engag'd might perhaps have serv'd me to laugh at But I was ever uneasy as well as  Worthy  out of each others Company and tho' we could only steal a Glance or sometimes the Touch of the hand Fancy improv'd our Pleasures and made them greater than any other Satisfaction out of our selves My first Fires were in their full force the Object only changed by an invisible Transmutation I lov'd to the heighth of all my former disorder but it was with a more pleasing Pain a secret Satisfaction in having made a Conquest over that hitherto inexorable Virgin Heart  I conceive their Fears were least young  Worthy  should marry me I was a Widow with an incumber'd Jointure and his Affairs requir'd a Wife with a Fortune in ready Money However our Intelligence had proceeded no farther than the word  Love  and it seems to me that he had not form'd no more than my self any designs towards the possession of what he lov'd  Mrs  Woudbe  and Mrs  Marwoud  the Name of the other Lady were invited to an Entertaniment in the Town that was like to hold till late Mrs  Abigal  was diverted another way so that I was left alone the old Husband being abroad upon his Occasions Young  Worthy  Ignorant of their Designs for they kept it from us was likewise from Home The Weather was hot I undrest my self to a loose NightGown and  Marseilles  Petticoat and laid me down after Dinner upon the Bed to sleep Young  Worthy  return'd by instinct or the Whispers of his good Genius as he calls it and hearing all were gone out came as usual to my Chamber I cast my Eyes to the Door as it open'd and saw him with so elevated a joy that scarce gave him time to shut it after him For running to me as I lay he threw himself upon my Mouth and Eyes and so transportedly kiss'd me that I cou'd no longer doubt but his Modesty was giving place to his Desires when hearing some body come up the Stairs which answer'd exactly to my Chamber I broke from his Arms and opening the Door was ready to swoon at the Sight of Mrs  Woudbe  return'd wery ill or pretendedly so She wou'd have gone in but I shut it after me and directed her into the DiningRoom She askt me who I had with me I told her in utmost Confusion a Gentleman She said why don't you then Madam go to him So I must answer'd I And returning shut the Door after me but the Key was left on the outside Young  Worthy  saw my Disorder and the guilty Air which yet I cou'd not recover I told him tho' we were never so Innocent all Appearances were against us My undress the  Dishabilie  of the Bed the Door shut upon us and my refusal to let her enter So that happen what wou'd  for his Sake I was resolved his Sister shou'd not see him who most diligently kept Centry in the DiningRoom to watch who shou'd come out I ran the Hazard and Scandal of being suspected with any other rather than being confirm'd with him She goes down to the Servants to enquire who was with me they tell her none but her Brother who was come in two Moments before her She return'd again to her post in the DiningRoom having not so far lost her respect to attempt my Chamber Door tho' as I told you the Key was on the outside I I was at my wits end for Invention and wou'd have him get out of my DressingroomWindow upon the Leads that answer'd to a Window in another part of the House and which by chance was then open from whence he might descend the back Stairs and possibly get off unseen He objected some Men that were working in the next Neighbours Yard I told him in a Case like that something must be hazarded And therefore removing with Expedition the Glass and Toylet that was spread upon a Table under that Window he shot in a Moment from one to the other and good Fortune favouring him got down the Stairs and through the House without any of their People seeing him This was a Lucky Conveyance successful Legerdemain And I recovering my Fright cou'd not chose but laugh at the sick Lady upon Duty she stir'd not from her Post I wonder how her Patience cou'd hold from interrupting us till after three Hours I calling for Candles She ask'd the Servant who brought 'em who was with me And she answering no body You must imagine what she cou'd think She had set one Centry at the Street Door which how they escaped seeing  Worthy  go out I can't  imagine her self had been upon the watch above I had told her there was a Gentleman in the Chamber with me one Maid says 'tis her Brother and soon after another tells her there was no body there My apparent Confusion and Dishabily All these were what confounded even her cunning I believe till that Minute she suspected not that her Brother had discover'd to me his Love but the Appearances were now Strong and she imagin'd us to be really Criminal Why shou'd I of a sudden be so undrest Why shut up alone with her Brother where she was refused enterance Why so confus'd These were indeed circumstantial Evidences But what cou'd I have said had she enter'd and found us as at first It wou'd have certainly condemn'd us and getting him off so was all that was left for us to do as making the best of a bad Market 'Twas at worst a moot point whether he was with me or no Politick Mrs  Woudbe  said nothing to her Brother or me but kept close as well as  Abigal  to their watch We had not time to speak together for above a Week after One Night he put a paper into my Hand which I have transcrib'd because your Curiosity may be oblig'd by reading a first LoveLetter without Art or Ornament the Effects only of what that Passion cou'd dictate for it seem'd to me 'twas to get the better of his Modesty that cou'd not had we had Opportunity so freely permit him to explain himself  The First LETTER  Expressing the Desire of a young Lover under Constraint  TELL me my Dear Inspiring Mistress how shall I express the Tender Passion of my Love Instruct your willing Scholar and give Directions by what means I may obtain an uncontroul'd access to your Dear Person without the Apprehension of disspiriting Fear The Genius's that haunt your Chamber prevent the Pleasure of your private Conversation and puts me into insupportable Pain to suppress the Appearance of the glowing Flames of Love raging in my Breast  If you wou'd preserve my Life you must suddenly find out some way how uninterrupted I may freely taste the sweets of Love 'Tis not in the Power of humane Nature unprov'd to conceive the inestimable Pleasures of powerful Love a Pleasure so great and so transporting that 'tis inexpressible My Thoughts too eagerly press upon one another and strive which shall tell you first how much I Love To describe your Bright Charms is too great an Attempt for my weak Genius I dare only say I feel the Effect in Extacy and Rapture I doubt not but your Goodness will excuse and pardon all defects of Nature especially when you've my Heart a Sacrifice for all  Oh Inconstancy but why that thought What need have I to fear Have not I receiv'd marks of special Favour But 'tis a Woman Yet the best of all her Sex all Truth and Goodness Ay but humane Nature in all things Loves change the highest Tides produce the lowest Ebbs Remember  Fair One  who taught me first to Love who brought me into this Labyrinth Will you now desert me Will you now  leave me to be lost inevitably tell me truly Or if I'm lost tell me not at all I'm past recovery 'tis not in the power of Time the coolest Thoughts of Reason nothing less than Death can unfix my Love grounded upon so firm an Esteem rivetted immoveable within my Heart I faintgive me Life Let me live and live to love you  To tell you the Pleasure this Letter gave me wou'd too much confirm you in the Opinion of my Weakness The next day being  Sunday  Mrs  Marwoud  went with me to Church as I was kneeling I cou'd not forbear taking out the Paper to read it I thought her at her Devotions and never minded her squint over my Shoulders Whence she gain'd the first part of the Letter which confirm'd her Opinion from the Sight of the Character whence it came My Lover for a Night or two after staid in my Chamber later by half an Hour than the rest the Door was open and we cou'd not speak so low but we were overheard Those precious Moments those delightful Embraces those piercing Kisses never to be recall'd all was at the Mercy of Mrs  Woudbe  who by hearkning gave her self a Confirmation to her Fears And the Second Night met him at his own ChamberDoor as he came from me with millions of Reproaches I knew nothing of what was past till the next Night he put this Second Letter into my Hand  The Second LETTER  Excusing himself from being any more alone  'TIS impossible to express the Concern with which I write to you upon this unpleasant Subject We were overheard if not seen last Night by my married Sister she receiv'd me at the head of the Stairs shut my ChamberDoor and began to open  I was not so much surpris'd as I thought I shou'd have bin upon such an Occasion she said she cou'd not believe what she had been told had not her own Ears convinc'd her as to the Truth of it she recounted to me many particular Passages especially that when you in so much Confusion thrust her out of the Room when you had only a NightGown on and I in the Chamber with you  I answer'd That she had given her self a great deal of Trouble to little purpose I did not suppose but she'd a truer Opinion of Both that indeed I lik'd to be with you because you were improving and delightful Company but no further and that a  ealous Listner hearing imperfectly some Words and not others turn'd all to the Subject they were apprehensive of or suspected If the talk was never so remote nothing more uncertain when the sound of Words cannot be distinguish'd I urg'd my own Innocence so we parted and appeas'd her pretty well upon the promise never to be alone with you again since it gave her so much uneasiness Lest you shou'd be ignorant of what has past I thought it proper this way to acquaint you with it that you might not judge untruly of my Neglect The hazard is at present too great for me to break my Promise therefore if you have and I can't think otherwise a real value for me  you won't desire it Believe me I shall ever have a sincere Love and Esteem for you who are the same or more to me than ever Tell me your Thoughts in a Letter and suddenly for I'm impatient till I hear from you  Pride and Indignation seiz'd me at the reading of this in a Stile so different from the former What his Dependance upon his Sister in point of Interest was I cou'd not tell but I thought be it never so great he made too large a Sacrifice to it and such as Love could never forgive him that I was discover'd and my Honour wrongfully suspected was not half my Concern Tho' that must needs sensibly affect a Soul haughty like mine and who wou'd rather meet Death than Shame I gave him my answer next Morning wherein I complain'd of the weakness of that Love which cou'd not stand one Assault the rest you may conclude by his Reply  The Third LETER  In Vindication of his doubted Love  WHAT have I wrote that you interpret so much to my Disadvantage I am surpris'd at your Answer You take my meaning quite contrary to my Intentions don't believe I can renounce and forsake you in whom I have first my chiefest Happiness I can't express the Tenderness of my Affection  for you believe me you shall never find the Fervency of my Love turn'd into Coolness or my Sincerity into Flattery nor my Soul guilty of any Ingratitude▪ If you have any Love for me don't perplex you  self for that gives me great Ʋneasiness nor imagin  I can have one unkind Thought for you I love you most dearly well indeed Time will produce it and  convince you of the Truth of all I say when Oppor  unity permits me to show how much how unalterably I am yours  I shou'd not have given you these Letters at  ength but only to beg your Judgment of my Lover's Sincerity he was some time before this about departing from us upon his own business with stupid Mrs  Abigal  for his Housekeeper I conceive Mrs  Woudbe  was of use to him she governing her Husband in point of Stock or Partnership that made him so cautious of disobliging her She Closeted him the next day employing three Hours in railing at me with the most prodigious absurd Abuses that Envy or Malice or the Devil himself cou'd invent Who does not know the power of an ill Tongue upon weak Minds He ought to have consider'd it that Interest and Revenge dictated to them and have with Fortitude and Justice withstood any Impression they wou'd have made upon him I believe indeed he was proof to a great part of it till industriously Mrs  Marwoud  owing me a good Turn for preventing her a Conquest she had a desire to told him I was a Lady only seeking my Diversions and in whom  Vanity  so much prevail'd as to expose his Letter to her and then repeated part of what she had cunningly read over my Shoulder He persisted in his denial that he had never writ to me any but when next we met I found his Eyes declin'd me and no longer animated by those bewitching softning Glances that sweetned all the Cruelties of Fortune and which Love of me first taught I pursu'd 'em but they were lost to me I found time to ask the Cause of the Change He answer'd I had expos'd his Letter 'twas what he cou'd not account to himself for and therefore must begin  to practise a difficult Care upon his Heart since I did but laugh at him I had not leisure to answer but upon Paper endeavour'd to convince him how the Matter hapned This gave me more pain than I can express If they cou'd succeed in such common Arts of making a misunderstanding between us 'twas in vain for me to expect the prospect of any happiness I suffer'd more real anguish by his false displeasure than I can describe My Letter wrought so far upon him that at the next Meeting I found the kindling Fire returning to his Eyes and when upon the first opportunity he caught me in his Arms to kiss me I felt the same Ease the same Release from Pain as a Writch took from the Rack or from that more exquisite Torture the Rack of Nature the Ease a Woman feels releas'd from  Motherpains  He said he had in vain strove for his Cure the more he strove the harder it was to conquer But my  Clorinda  I found how dear I was like to pay for that Letter which had so transported me Oh  Why must the Extremity of Pleasure produce the Extremity of Pain  I found his Mind daily shaken ev'n from its Foundation He never wou'd believe but that I had exposed his Letter And all that cou'd be said was That he endeavour'd to forgive it me But 'twas a Weakness he did not think I cou'd have been guilty of And if on the Side of Love I lost no ground with him I suffer'd much and wrongfully in his Esteem besides the Pain I had been in taught him the Power he had over me and which upon all occasions he too much exerted perplexing me as he pleas'd taking delight in the Alternate pains and pleasure that  cou'd raise in me and which I can't forgive him for this was all done by Snatches for since the first discovery I never had so much  as one quarter of an hours time to talk the matter over with him Thus stands the present State of our Amour he is gone to his own House distant from ours These three long tedious Days and Nights I have liv'd and liv'd without one Sight of him Tell me sincerely my  Clorinda  thou infallible Judge of Hearts What dost thou believe of his Cou'd I but find my self in earnest slighted Pride and Disdain in my haughty Soul must cure me For tho' I so long against my Will persisted constant to my first Engagements it was because our Separation was the work of cruel  Fortune  in which  Ʋnkindness  had not any part 'Twill be vain to expect my Cure from  Reason  for that points to  Mutual Love  as the greatest Good I am not my  Clorinda  born to Happiness when young betray'd and married where I cou'd never affect You know the next how my first dear Inclinations were cross'd see if I have any better hopes of this  Fortune  cruelly is against me I can't hope not to be happy Oh restore me then by your wise Counsels to that bless'd State of  Indifferency  Extinguish in me if it be possible these eternal Sparks of  Love  or teach me to transfer it to a brighter a more worthy Object improve this humane to a Love Divine Let me there only fix my  Eternal  Hopes of unfading Joys of Pleasures unknowing a decay where without Reproach it will be meritorious to excell in Fondness there only where excess of Passion gives without Remorse excess of Pleasure free from those allays attending Transitory Joys Oh aid me here to fix my Hopes my Happiness without End and without Change as I am yours  LETTER VII  A Renunciation of  Chymistry  TIS to me since my late Reflections and self Discourses a plain Illusion of some evil Spirit that any Body of sense believes in Chymistry nor can I otherwise imagine how your Scrub should be yet Venerable I am heartily glad I am cur'd of all those Hopes and prefer Jealousy of my Mistress to the Torment of a Philosophick Doubt and think that a less fantastick Affliction than this How can you let Scrub still mislead you How can the Devil delude in his own Shape If I come to Town time enough and may be admitted of your Politick Council we will contrive a part in a Play for  Roxana  were she drawn affecting and unfit for those very Airs she would be thought in reallity to have it would methinks be miraculously surprising to turn all her natural Faults to stupid Deformities and make the awkard Woman a skilful Actress I long to see Dr  Garth  's nine days Wonder of that date I think you say was the Edition You tell me you long to see what I have done when you do you'll find it like all other strong Desires end in disappointment for there is neither Love Gallantry or Poetry in it but what to me surpasses at present the Charms of 'em all downright Religion which all you Wits laugh at but indeed laugh at for want of Reflection for if you'd allow it your Consideration you'd all be Votaries it has so much of your only good Pleasure I assure you I am going to my Prayers which profusion of  Delight is imbitter'd only by the Thought that you and all my Friends will not share in it  LETTER VIII  A Letter of Friendship  THE first Visit I should have made in Town had been to you but that I have some Vexations to remove before I can be at Rest and Liberty Besides Mrs  P  s  now my greatest Terror has prevented my venturing to you Be pleas'd to send me a Billet wherein I may know I am in your Favour and that you'll assist me with your usual seasonable and habile Friendship on this occasion and you will extreamly oblige  Madam  Your most obedient Servant  R  St  le  LETTER IX  Consisting of various Heads  Dear Madam  YOurs of  Saturday  Night I just now receiv'd and am oblig'd to you for your Condolance of my lost Mistress but you make up the misfortune on the account of your Recovery tho you tell me my other is also vanish'd 'Tis very generous of the Princess to forgive me so far as to send me her Service as much  Roxana  as she is on the Stage she is  Statira  elsewhere I would methinks write Panegyrick on so great an Heroine as a Woman that can forgive an Injury an Injury done to her Beauty be pleas'd Madam to preserve yours with your Health and stay as long as you can before you are Immortal which your Genius has ensur'd you I heartily pray for you and have while I invoke your Happiness a reason for Devotion out of which you cannot rally me I am  Madam  Your most obedient and most humble Servant  R  St  le  I shall be reliev'd here I think to morrow and be commanded to  Greenwich  LETTER X  A Congratulation on the Encrease of the Lady's Riches  'TIS an hour I would say an Age since my last to you and I find that Joy has something in it as troublesome as Grief can bring Your Accession of Wealth you'll be apt to think the occasion of my repeated Impertinence 'Tis methinks an injury to me that you are so rich since your Fortune may lessen the sincerity of my professing an Admiration for you But Madam a Truth in the search of Nature could be found only by your Industry who are your self the best Pattern of what she can do all I can say to you is may you ever live in the till now imagin'd Riches of Chymistry and adorn'd with all the Panegyrick of Poetry if any thing in the latter can add to the Author of so excellent Pieces as your own Nothing but the News in yours could inspire me to so much calmness of Mind as to be able to tell you I am  Madam  Your most obedient humble Servant  R  St  le  LETTER XI  An Answer to a Lady that had desired to make him a Visit in the Country  FATE would have exerted its utmost Severity had it loaded me with your Unkindness after a Misfortune which nothing but that can equal I mean the death of an Uncle who was to me instead of a Father I have been with him during part of his Illness and staid to see him interr'd which was the occasion of my having but just now found your Letter in which I can never sufficiently admire the Generosity of your Temper who though you had seemingly a real Cause to be angry could yet bestow new Favours when the Balance was already so much on your side I could with Transport accept the Offer you make were it not for some Relations we have with us and some other Reasons I could tell you which make it at present not so convenient but will I hope shortly be otherwise Though my Absence prevented me from hearing of you it should not however have made me thus forgetful of writing had my Thoughts not been disturb'd with so sad an Object as render'd them unfit for Love and You who producing only the most pleasing Ideas should  Halcyon  like brood upon a Calm Pray think of me as one who has the greatest Esteem in the World for you and who assures you of it without Art but with a great deal of Sincerity I am  Henry Blount  LETTER XII  Two Letters of Love by the Late  D  of  D  RAvish'd with reflecting on past Delights and more with Expectation of those to come for some time after I left you I found no room for any Thoughts but Joy At last your going out of Town like a black sullen Storm dasht all my pleasing Hopes and struck me worse than Thunder If this cruel Journey cannot be put off let me at least live in hopes of seeing you in the Country and that it may be suddenly else I shall wish I had never tasted of Joys which serve only to make me the more unhappy by losing them as soon as I know how much they are to be valu'd  LETTER XIII  THE News your Letter brought me and which I did not receive till MidNight made me fall into a Distemper as much worse than the Former as the pains of the Mind exceed those of the Body since we are come to that cruel point of Time that separates me from the only Pleasure I wou'd live to taste Give me your Permission and as I told you in my last I will find a means to come down in some disguise  I here send you my Picture there was another doing which wou'd have been better Now I will burn it and at the same time curse my hard Fate for depriving me of so many happy Moments which my Dear nothing but your return can restore  FINIS  THE CONTENTS  LETTER I From an
