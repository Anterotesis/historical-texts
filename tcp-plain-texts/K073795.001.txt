OF GEORGE CAWTHORN BRITISH LIBRARY STRAND    TO HIS GRACE  THE DUKE OF LEEDS  A FRUIT a Flower a Feather have been accepted by persons of superior station when tendered as tributes of affection and respect as such only can the following trifles hope to be accepted and that they are truly such is the only apology the Author can make for having wished to address them to  him  whose qualities ennoble rank and adorn both public and private lifeThat this is not the  style  of  Dedication  but the  language  of  Truth  the world can attest or the Writer would blush to use it He is  equally sensible of and grateful for the honour of being permitted to subscribe himself  His Grace's highly obliged and very obedient humble servant THOMAS HULL  PREFACE  THE following little Compositions which I have dignified with the title of  Moral Tales  have been the employment of several leisure hours at different periods of time Some of them have been written many years as the respective dates specify but none of them printed till now except the last in the second volume of which further mention shall be made in its proper place  Mr ADDISON describes himself as always being possessed of a disposition to examine such old prints and ballads as he saw pasted upon the walls of cottages c I have not only discovered the same turn in myself and I would I could find something else  more similar to that excellent writer but I have ever even from childhood felt my attention peculiarly engaged by stories related in company which have contained in them any thing of the marvellous and supernatural Hence it is probably that I have so long retained many of the singular events whereon the ensuing compositions are founded  I have been I can say it with great truth repeatedly urged to publish them by friends who have seen the manuscriptsThe Reader perhaps will call them very  partial  friends it may be so And I am ready to acknowledge that after a careful revisal they are much better calculated to elicit the approbation of a kind heart than to obtain the commendation of a critical judgment  HENRY  OR VIRTUE ITS OWN REWARD  ADDRESSED TO  JOHN BEARD ESQ    MUSA NEC IMMEMORES NOS SINIT ESSE TUI  From an Inscription in the Cloysters in Westminster Abbey  ADDRESS TO  JOHN BEARD ESQ  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR  The event whereon this Tale is founded occurred at Margate in Kent in the year It was related to the Author by his worthy friend Mr BEARD immediately on his return from that place The singularity of the occurrence induced the author to attempt giving it a poetical dress and dedicate it to his friend  THE Tale from thee receiv'd to thee I send  With all the warmest wishes of a friend  That thro' life's stream thy private skiff may sail  With easy current and with quiet gale  Now calmly moor'd where beauteous  Hampton  sees  Thames' silver current dimpling with the breeze  Where genuine GARRICK in his fair retreat  To our lov'd Bard  erects the hallow'd seat  O ne'er may Sorrow's envious cloud annoy  Thy private comfort or convivial joy  But soft content protect thy chosen haunt  Till thou no more can'st wish or  Time  no more can grant  VIRTUE ITS OWN REWARD  TALE I  I  Lo to the North dark scouls the rising storm  It swells it bursts with wideresounding roar  Quickgathering clouds the face of day deform  And the big wave incessant beats the shore  II  Now all the caves that hold the winds unbarr'd  Each deathdenouncing blast at once outflies  Tremendous sounds on ev'ry side are heard  One universal gloom obscures the skies  III  One universal and unvarying gloom  Save where with momentary cleave it breaks  To give the flashing lightning's terror room  While bellowing thunder air earth ocean shakes  IV  The shudd'ring peasant from yon distant cot  Views with astonishment th' upturned main  ThanksHeav'n which granted him a tranquil lot  And shields him in his homely thatch again  V  Ah sad ELIZA what was then thy pain  What anguish did thy gentle bosom tear  Didst thou not tortures in each sound sustain  And all Death's horrors in each object fear  VI  Didst thou not frequent turn thy woestruck eye  Where the drench'd casement pointed to the main  Reprove implore the unrelenting sky  With sobs that heav'd and tears that stream'd in vain  VII  Didst thou not thus th' unpitying storm upbraid  "Why now your cruel terrors send abroad  "Why with destructive fires the port invade  "Where HENRY's vessel seeks a quiet road  VIII  "Where HENRY seeks his traffick and his toil  "To crown with homefelt bliss and soft repose  "Yet ye unkind his honest hopes beguile  "And bid ELIZA's bosom teem with woes  IX  "Perhaps ye ruthless messengers of Fate  "Ye mean my HENRY shall no more return  "Ye mean that here our loves shall close their date  "The child a sire the wise a husband mourn  X  Her blooming boy whom now ten suns had cheer'd  Pitying the first sad sigh his mother heav'd  Forth to the beach impetuous had repair'd  Nor felt the blast nor at the thunder griev'd  XI  Still the relentless storm dealt forth its wrath  Still the swoll'n sky its streaming torrents pour'd  Still the blue lightning menac'd frequent death  Louder and louder still vex'd Ocean roar'd  XII  And was it HENRY in that ruthless hour  Thy beating vessel sought the port to gain  By ev'ry dang'rous gust at random tore  In that dread conflict 'twixt the heav'ns and main  XIII  It wasAh hapless man thy skill is vain  The Pilot's hand no more the helm obeys  The sails are rent the mainmast splits in twain  Heartpiercing yells thewretched suff'rers raise  XIV  But Heav'n regardful of thy virtuous love  Thy genuine truth and honest industry  Bade the disabled hulk selfguided move  And make her harbour thro' the per'lous sea  XV  'Tis donethy native cliffs appear in view  The lightnings pause the thunders cease to roar  Down to the boat descend the eager crew  And thro' tumultuous billows seek the shore  XVI  Joy rapture gratitude devotionall  That goodness feels our HENRY's heart possess'd  He sigh'd he wept he wonder'd he ador'd  Unutterable transport swell'd his breast  XVII  Near and more near the plying oars advance  HENRY devours the land with eager eye  Now thinks with forward haste the surges dance  Now thinks with loit'ring pace they backward hye  XVIII  When from the Pier before his startled look  A Child falls headlong in the foaming wave  HENRY's prompt heart with instant anguish struck  Bleeds for the hapless boy and yearns to save  XIX  While he pervades the place with eye intent  Where the dividing flood the child receiv'd  Th' upturning waves the struggling form present  Again with mighty woe his bosom heav'd  XX  All that humanest Pity could persuade  All that instinctive Piety enjoin  In one great thought his glowing mind invade  And swift he plunges in the foaming brine  XXI  He plunges and he graspsone arm upheaves  A  ove the waters the declining head  While with the other combating the waves  He ploughs his passage thro' the surfy bed  XXII  His toil is o'erhis prize he brings to land  His prize no victim yet to hungry Death  With softest care he lays him on the strand  Chafes the chill form to soothe back wand'ring breath  XXIII  Clear'd from the dripping locks th' unclosing eyes  With languid sweetness now on HENRY shine  When with wild look and voice suppress'd he cries  "It isOh gracious Godthe  Boy  is  mine  XVIV  The landed crew the  Man of Virtue  hail  The  Man of Virtue  gath'ring crowds proclaim  Each to his neighbour gives the wond'rous tale  And panting rumour labours with his fame  XXV  The buzzing train attend with eager pace  As HENRY speeds to chase ELIZA's tears  Close to his bosom lock'd in fond embrace  His rescued treasure to her arms he bears  XXVI  The speechless joys of their encount'ring loves  What skill can paint what language can record  Replete with bliss the  Man of Virtue  proves  THAT DEEDS OF VIRTUE ARE THEIR OWN REWARD

*  SPRUNG from an antient noble line  Wherein illustrious heroes shine  Why by unworthy deeds debase  The honours of that splendid race  Endow'd with Fortune's boundless store  Whence this absurd desire for more  Beyond what Av'rice could desire  Or wild Ambition's thirst inspire  Is pour'd around in lavish waste  To please thine eye and tempt thy taste  Why honourable equals shun  And to inglorious circles run  Thy time and talents to prophane  With unremitting search of gain  Proud parks inclose thee manors fair  Prolific meads and waters clear  And shalt thou negligent of fame  From Tenants hard exactions claim  Industrious Peasantry oppress  And make their little po  its less  Young Miser ceaseaspire to know  The godlike pleasureto bestow  Seek not for wealth by wealth's abuse  But place it to its noblest use  Search where the lab'ring poor abide  Unshelter'd by thy forestside  Relieve their wants their spirits cheer  And bid them bless the coming year  When hov'ring mildews rot the soil  And cheat the Farmer's honest toil  Or when th' Engrosser's churlish door  Withholds the portion of the poor  Then thy full garners wide expand  And fill the needy Rustic's hand  Or seek

OLD ENGLISH BALLAD  IN TWO PARTS  PART I  I  WHILE France her character maintain'd  For elegance and arts  What time a lineal Monarch reign'd  Within his people's hearts  II  Ere yet the servile foot had learn'd  On Nobles' necks to tread  Or Anarchy a blinded land  With lawless fury sway'd  III  Ere yet a foul Iscariotband  Prophanely had imbru'd  Their impious sacrilegious hands  In their mild master's blood  Alluding to the Massacre of LOUIS XVI King of France on Monday January  IV  FOSCUE on LANGUEDOC'S fair plain  In avarice grown old  Whose only zeal was thirst of gain  Whose only God was Gold  V  FOSCUE on LANGUEDOC'S fair plain  Full long abode had held  And there by many a cruel deed  His sordid bags had fill'd  VI  For his the usage was to farm  The Province from the State  This man FOSCUE was one of the FarmersGeneral The event whereon this Tale is founded happened about the year  And to himself from lab'ring hinds  Foul profit to create  VII  And his the usage to exact  Whate'er might ravag'd be  To the extent of hardearn'd gains  From honest industry  VIII  Yet many a meadow fair and wide  And many a fertile field  Had wont to Tenant as to Lord  An ample tribute yield  IX  And many a thrifty family  Beneath their humble shed  By daily culture of the soil  In peace and comfort fed  X  Till FOSCUE's avaricious hand  Oppress'd the toiling poor  Nor heeded he what they endur'd  So he increas'd his store  XI  VALMONT to better prospects born  Than lab'ring for his bread  Thro' strange misfortune here was doom'd  To hide his drooping head  XII  Where Patience the enduring child  Of calm Philosophy  Had taught him to abide his lot  Whate'er that lot might be  XIII  Three Children and a virtuous Wife  His age's only store  He daily toil'd to keep from want  Nor did he covet more  XIV  Protector lab'rer tutor all  Yet grudg'd he not the toil  So by his little fire at eve  He could but see them smile  XV  Ah woe the whilea sudden blight  Spread desolation round  And VALMONT's labours were bereft  The harvest of his ground  XVI  FOSCUE the season's dues demands  Demands with speech severe  Nor him the kneeling children move  Nor him the mother's tear  XVII  Their humble furniture he seiz'd  Their vestments and their bed  Nor left them wherewithal to buy  The wretched morrow's bread  XVIII  "Hast thou no pity" VALMONT says  "Thy end fell fiend beware  "Lest thou in turn should'st wail and cry  "Where none thy cries shall hear"  XIX  The door rapacious FOSCUE clos'd  Withdrew nor look'd behind  But left the suppliants to endure  The coming winter's wind  PART II  I  NOT many months were gone and past  When Statenecessities  Thro' ev'ry Province in the land  Exacted large supplies  II  Strait the penurious FOSCUE hears  And trembles for his store  He veils his av'rice with a lye  And pleads that he is poor  III  Pleads "How should he alas have means  "The public wants to aid  "How scrape together more than serves  "To purchase daily bread"  IV  Such were the mean evasions sent  To the State Deputies  In hope from him they would not claim  A share of the supplies  V  Yet lest a gen'ral search be made  He frames a secret hold  Wherein he craftily conceals  His heap of treasur'd gold  VI  Some few short days elaps'd they come  To FOSCUE's they repair  Suspecting much some mean deceit  But FOSCUE is not there  VII  They search the dwelling high and low  They search the land around  But vain their search enquiry vain  No FOSCUE can be found  VIII  Some few days more are now elaps'd  When FOSCUE's house and lands  Together with the post he fill'd  Are giv'n to other hands  IX  Lo now the antient edifice  Repair immediate asks  And the new substitute himself  O'erlooks the workman's tasks  X  As the foundation dang'rous grown  With caution they explore  Within the cellar's depth they find  A closeconcealed door  XI  A key within its fixture plac'd  Then challenges amaze  Which turning in a sliding lock  The weighty door they raise  XII  Descending by the taper's light  Astounded they behold  Old FOSCUE's famish'd carcase stretch'd  Amid his hoarded gold  XIII  There hoping to conceal his pelf  The pond'rous selflock'd door  In vengeance o'er his head had clos'd  To ope for him no more  XIV  Debarr'd at once all hope to view  The light of Heav'n again  What dreadful complicated pangs  Did FOSCUE not sustain  XV  Might not prophetic VALMONT's words  Return upon his ear  While there condemn'd to "wail and cry  "Where none his cries could hear"  XVI  The Miser's lacerated limbs  Disgusted they survey  The flesh from either shrivell'd arm  Thro' hunger gnaw'd away  XVII  Thus selfdevoted FOSCUE dy'd  Most strange but righteous doom  Since all his hoarded illgot wealth  But serv'd to build his tomb  TALE THE THIRD  ELDRED  OR THE JUSTICE OF RETALIATION  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR  ADDRESSED TO  MISS M * * * * * * * *  With whatsoever measure ye mete it shall be measured to ye again  ST MATT chap vii v    Christ's Sermon on the Mount  ADDRESS  TO MISS M * * * * * * * *  I KNOW my fair thy early breast  With love of virtue is possess'd  Be then a steady zeal for  Truth  The system of thy rising youth  If duty to that Providence  Who gave thee being strength and sense  Within thy heart retain its seat  Truth  will not quit the dear retreat  An unremitting  love of God  Is thy best guide through life's dim road  To gild reflection with delight  As time advances in his flight  Let duty to thy parent sway  The conduct of each rising day  On the soft tablet of thy breast  Be this dear precept deep imprest  Observe it chief when age or care  Shall silver o'er her ebon hair  If testy pain unkindly speak  Thy swelling temper duteous check  Ah do not thou augment that pain  She  may  but thou  may'st not  complain  Oh curs'd above all others he  Who harden'd in impiety  Transgresses duty's holy bound  And dares a parent's bosom wound  Oh let him tremble lest he want  That comfort he refus'd to grant  List list my child with awful ear  And shudder at the tale you hear  THE TALE OF  ELDRED  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR  I  WELLnigh consum'd with malady and years  Now totters ELDRED on life's latest stage  Down his pale cheek distill incessant tears  And want and sorrow wear his failing age  II  Deep in its hollow cell now fades the eye  Which once on life's gay prospect brightly shone  In his shrunk veins the loit'ring pulses die  Their active course impair'd their vigour flown  III  Where's now the glowing heart that wont to beat  At rapture's call and warm th' expanding breast  Chill is the glowing heart the vital heat  And life's repairing sources near suppress'd  IV  Who but would melt as they behold those hairs  Which erst with burnish'd auburn wont to glow  Now chang'd by grief and soulcorroding cares  All whiten'd o'er like winter's drizzled snow  V  A beauteous consort bless'd his noon of life  Who in that noon of life was snatch'd away  When most he knew to prize he lost the wife  To their first pledge of love an early prey  VI  Yet Heav'n ordain'd the infant pledge to live  O what a soothing to a father's breast  His loss to lighten and his woe relieve  Were filial duty on his soul impress'd  VII  But ELDRED's shameless son in early youth  Gave tokens of a thwart disnatur'd mind  To froward malice sullenness untruth  And ev'ry opposite to good inclin'd  VIII  In manhood's prime now flies he far astray  From filial duty gratitude and love  Leaves a sick sire to pain and want a prey  In lawless pleasures impious paths to rove  IX  Wealth jewels leases each paternal right  His plund'ring hand from his sad father drain'd  The mansion once so goodly to the sight  Disfurnish'd unrepair'd alone remains  X  Bedrid and restless hark the parent cries  From morn to eve makes unavailing moan  Round the bare chamber casts his hopeless eyes  Where cold winds pierce and echo groan for groan  XI  Ah miserable man and are there yet  Severer ills in hard Affliction's store  Can a son's hand yet greater crimes commit  Can  he  inflict and must  thou  suffer more  XII  Yes miserable man there yet remain  Severer ills in hard Affliction's store  From a son's hand thou yet must more sustain  He can inflict and thou must suffer more  XIII  For now returning with distemper'd soul  From loose associates of his luxury  Intoxicated with the madd'ning bowl  And beggar'd by the false bewitching dye  XIV  With rage inflam'd he seeks his father's bed  That bed which he himself had robb'd of rest  There with wild looks that scatter'd horrid dread  He thus unfolds his unrelenting breast  XV  "My gold is goneHast thou no more old sire  "Hast thou no precious gems no hidden store  "Be quick to gratify my keen desire"  The parent sighs "My son I have no more  XVI  "Yet cast not such unduteous looks on me  "Let not displeasure on a father frown  "While I had wealth I gave that wealth to thee  "All  my  possessions were they not  thine own  XVII  "In times less wretched than the present hour  "Did not a sparing meal  my  board supply  "While  thou  in wanton riot didst devour  "My lavish'd gold in wasteful luxury  XVIII  "In all the sickness all the griefs I bore  "When almost fainting in the arms of death  "Thou ne'er wast nigh my spirits to restore  "Or raise my lab'ring breast when scant of breath  XIX  "Leave leave me now my son to sigh my last  "To dye aloneI perish now thro' want  "No more thy prodigality can waste  "Thou hast no more to seek nor I to grant'  XX  "Yes thou hast more this mansion yet is left  "This mansion which by heritage is mine"  "Let me not yet my son of this be 'reft  "Some few short  strugglings  more and  this  is thine  XXI  "While painful life remains O do not tear  "This only cov'ring from my wretched head  "No no my son I must  will  perish here  "Then patient wait till thou shalt see me dead  XXII  "The awful moments may yet remain  "I would employ in peace and pious pray'r  "That my sad soul some mercy may obtain  "For O my son guilt guilt sits heavy there  XXIII  "Then from thy brow those frowns and scoulings chase  "And leave me not with anger in thine eye  "With one kind glance thank me for what I  was  "So may thy father bless thee ere he die"  XXIV  "Peace dotard peace rejoins th' unnat'ral son  "Thy counsel I despise thy age I scorn  "Too long old ELDRED's wretched date hath run  "And wretched I because of ELDRED born"  XXV  This said the fiend with fury unrestrain'd  Twists round his grasp his father's silver hairs  And drags him pleading with out stretched hand  Far as the passage op'ning to the stairs  XXVI  When thus the sire's heartrending screams implore  "In pity cease enough thy hand has done  "Drag not  thy  father past this guilty floor  "Thus far and but thus far I dragg'd my own"  XXVII  Th' astonish'd wretch foregoes his impious hold  The storm of rage is in an instant still  With cruelty and wine no longer bold  Quickdarting horrors all his senses chill  XXVIII  While thus the sire with falt'ring voice pursues  "Behold my son thy father stretch'd in dust  "Thus Vengeance claims from me its righteous dues  "I own I own my punishment is just  XXIX  "Thus did I on  my  father's sorrows scoul  "Thus to the ground  his  hallow'd person cast  "But Heav'n so deal with my distracted soul  "As here I pardon thee" He sigh'd his last  XXX  By reason wak'd the culprit lives to woe  The mansion now his sick'ning eyes detest  O'er his foul hands unceasing torrents flow  And unremitting tortures gnaw his breast  TALE THE FOURTH  THE EXCELLENCE OF SELFDENIAL  EXEMPLIFIED IN  SIR PHILIP SIDNEY  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR  ADDRESS TO THE  HON WILLIAM KEPPEL  ON HIS RETURN FROM THE CONQUEST OF THE HAVANNAH IN  OH thou whose bosom glows with love of arms  Whom patriot zeal and patriot glory charms  Who kindling courage lov'st yet lov'st to see  That courage temper'd by humanity  Whose eye relenting views the crimson'dblade  And mourns the slaughter thine own arm has made  Whose feeling bosom can the chain beguile  Of half its weight and bid the captive smile  Relieve the needy give the wounded rest  And share the anguish of the meanest breast  To noble SIDNEY's Tale incline thine ear  And praise the  British Worthy  with a tear  THE TALE OF  SIR PHILIP SIDNEY  Now front to front th' embattled legions stand  And chide the loit'ring trumpet's slowcommand  Thy turrets ZUTPHEN  Zutphen  a City of the County of Zutphen in the Province of Gelderland situated on the River Yssel  the dread scene beheld  Each toil each horror of the desp'rate field  When his stout bands to hardy dangers bred  Before thy walls courageous DUDLEY  ROBERT DUDLEY Earl of Leicester Uncle to Sir PHILIP SIDNEY  led  To vindicate against imperious SPAIN  The power and honour of ELIZA's reign  There fell the pride of fair BRITANNIA's host  The scholar's poet's soldier's statesman's boast  There SIDNEY fell while BERGEL's  The River  Bergel  which crosses the Province of Munster runs through the centre of the City of Zutphen and falls into the Yssel  rolling flood  Dy'd Yssel's copious stream with noble blood  There SIDNEY fell whom Cam's and Isis' shore  Heard their learn'd sons in plaintive verse deplore  Him PENSHURST still laments thro' all her groves  And all her Graces mourn and all her Loves  And ev'ry shepherd burthen'd with the tale  With sighs of sorrow fills the passing gale  Arcadia still through all her beauties moans  The lawns still sigh and still the forest groans  In murmurs soft the streams lament him still  Each fount laments and ev'ry rippling rill  Each plant each shrub and ev'ryop'ning flow'r  And ev'ry infant bud that decks the bow'r  The very genius of the place complains  For him their first their last their best of swains  Say Muse when panting for the battle's heat  First in each danger and each glorious feat  What palm was left for SIDNEY then to claim  To shine superior in the lists of fame  What wondrous mark was left what sacred sign  To prove his soul of origin divine  At length the trumpet gives the dread command  Forth rush the leaders of each adverse band  Nearer and nearer now the troops advance  Sword clashes sword and lance engages lance  And side by side o'er Zutphen's bloody plains  Big horror strides and death despotic reigns  Keen hope of glory flashing from his eyes  Forth to the hottest press brave SIDNEY flies  The fiery steed by the great chief bestrode  Neighs proudly conscious of his noble load  Ah what avails his strength his martial strain  His crested beauty and wideflowing mane  The whirring bullet gives the deadly wound  The proud beast falls and shakes the echoing ground  A second steed the rising hero tries  A second steed in welt'ring slaughter lies  A third is broughtbut while with active bound  Th' undaunted warrior vaulting spurns the ground  The thund'ring cannon deals its fellest stroke  His thigh is torn the strongknit bone is broke  Life's gushing stream its bursting cells forsakes  The shatter'd splinters jar the nerves relax  The furious steed perceives the sclacken'd rein  And wildly prances o'er the crimson plain  Torn from his station'd rank great SIDNEY's heart  Yet pants for fame he scorns his body's smart  Clings to his seat fit bier to hold the brave  And bear their relicts to the laurel'd grave  His streaming wound at length bold DUDLEY spies  And mourns his SIDNEY's fate with gushing eyes  His sinking body the surrounding bands  Receive obedient to their Lord's commands  Faint with a waste of blood on earth they lay  Their noble load and mournful duty pay  Friends weep aloud and ev'n the pausing foe  Regrets the stroke which laid that hero low  The suff'rer thus"O thou ally'd in worth  "As join'd in blood to him that gave me birth  "The blow is dealt the fatal ball has sped  "Which numbers SIDNEY with the hallow'd dead  "For England's weal my life is nobly spent  "For England's weal my latest pray'r is sent  "Be she victorious and I die content  "One slender service I alone in treat  "I faint I sicken with excess of heat  "A burning fever rages thro' my veins  "And scorching thirst each vital moisture drains  "One cooling drop to my parch'd lips extend  "The last sad kindness thou can'st shew thy friend"  A scanty portion the nighwasted spring  Alone supplies the cask with speed they bring  He sees and blesses the approaching band  And eager seizes it with trembling hand  When straight before his view sad soldiers bear  A dying comrade from the ranks of war  Who struggling in  extremest  torment lies  And views the sparkling draught with earnest eyes  SIDNEY beholds the wretch and inly grieves  Th' untasted fluid from his lips he gives  And thus"The draught I willingly resign  "Take it  thy wants  are greater still than  mine"  Ye who luxuriate in unbounded store  On penury unbounded comforts pour  And ye possess'd but of a  slender  share  Of Fortune's gifts yet heed the poor man's pray'r  From you more meritorious comes the dole  Than from their hands who in abundance roll  From out your scanty cup one drop bestow  On him who sinks in poverty and woe  And say like SIDNEY with a soul benign  "Take it thy wants are greater still than mine"  TALE THE FIFTH  THE UNCONSCIOUS AVENGER OR THE  TALE OF ALLEYNE  IN THE ANTIENT BALLAD STYLE  IN TWO PARTS  Raro antecedentem scelestum  Deseruit pede poena claudo  HORAT  INTRODUCTION  AND do ye not the story know  Of ALLEYNE the  good Boy  Who work'd the murd'rer mickle woe  And liv'd his mother's joy  I'll tell ye thenin Cestrian Plains  The tale full well is known  Deliver'd down for many a year  From parent to the son  I learn'd it from a  mother's  tongue  Who  "strok'd my youthful head"  While on her honey'd words I hung  Yet heard with silent dread  A mother whose maternal care  Few mothers could surpass  And she was graceful good and fair  And kind as fair she was  And as the due her virtues claim  These filial thanks I pay  And with her  everhonour'd name  Thus  dignify  my lay  THE TALE OF  ALLEYNE  PART I  I  THE noontide sun with fervid beams  Now gilded ev'ry hill  When MARIAN sought the willow shade  Beside the ripling rill  II  There as she ply'd the needle's task  Her bosom throbb'd with woe  And down her faded cheek full oft  Tears trickled soft and slow  III  And often as she rais'd her eyes  Athwart the distant mead  And mark'd the entrance of the wood  Her heart with anguish bled  IV  For there she trac'd her WILLIAM's steps  As he pursu'd his way  Full lightly to the neighb'ring town  By morning's ruddy ray  V  To sell the produce of his land  Of grain a plenteous store  She saw him enter in the wood  But never saw him more  VI  Now five afflicting years had past  Since she began to mourn  The father of her ALLEYNE dear  Who never did return  VII  ALLEYNE who knew his mother's wont  When morn's hard toil was o'er  Would duly to appease her grief  Her pensive haunts explore  VIII  Full fifteen years had crown'd the youth  His form of promise rare  And comely was he to the view  And dutiful as fair  IX  Daily he grew in the esteem  Of Pastor Knight and Squire  And oft a casual dole obtain'd  To mend his scanty hire  X  Soon as beneath the willow's shade  His mother he descries  And views her pond'ring o'er the stream  With swoll'n and wat'ry eyes  XI  He seats him gently by her side  And thus he soothes her woe  "Must then this trickling tide of grief  "For ever ever flow  XII  "And never will the hand of Time  "Abate my mother's pain  "Ne'er shall the smiles she us'd to wear  "On ALLEYNE shine again"  XIII  "Ah can'st thou marvel" MARIAN cries  "That thus my sorrows flow  "Too well thou know'st my dearest son  "My cause for constant woe  XIV  "Just such a bright and fervid sun  "As this enrich'd the plain  "When WILLIAM left thy mother's side  "But ne'er return'd again  XV  "With him we lost the richest crop  "That e'er our glebe bestow'd  "Since when thou know'st bleak indigence  "Hath made with us abode"  XVI  "Too well I know" the boy replies  "Why thus thy sorrows flow  "Young as I am I sore regret  "And I partake thy woe  XVII  "Yet these continual streaming tears  "My mother's health consume  "And lillies sit upon that cheek  "Where once the rose did bloom  XVIII  "Assuage thy grief nor let despair  "Thy gentle heart invade  "Since God doth give me daily strength  "To lend my mother aid  XIX  "And late and early will I toil  "So thou may'st peace enjoy"  Through tears she smil'd and close embrac'd  Her ALLEYNE her  good Boy  XX  Smiles were the only answer made  She had not power to speak  But in complacent silence wip'd  The drops from off her cheek  XXI  And duteous ALLEYNE kept his word  He early toll'd and late  And God bestow'd him daily strength  To mend their poor estate  XXII  His toils were bless'd each harvest home  Increas'd their little store  And in

ALCON  THE morn was calm a gentle gale  Scarce fill'd the boatman's scanty sail  The sky its brightest splendour gave  In various beauties to the wave  While in the breeze the dancing spray  Like liquid lightning seem'd to play  Long on the beach had HOWEL stood  Contemplating the placid flood  At length the melancholy man  In plaintive accents thus began  "O hadst thou treacherous Ocean worn  "A look thus mild on that sad morn  "When I endeavour'd all in vain  "To land secure my hardearn'd gain  "I should not now from day to day  "Upon thy naked confines stray  "And thus recal with wat'ry eye  "The date of my calamity  "What ardour did my mind inflame  "When near you haven's mouth we came  "What hope within my bosom grew  "When yonder point arose to view  "With premature belief elate  "I fondly thought indulgent Fate  "Would spare the produce of my toil  "To make my homely dwelling smile  "Presumptuous thoughtI could not save  "The scantiest pittance from the wave  "Afresh I feel each throb each fear  "Each horror of the former year  "Again I see the day o'ercast  "Again I hear the hollow blast  "Again I hear the billows roar  "Again they burst upon the shore  "Again I see my vessel lost  "And all my earthly wishes crost  "All that should be the means of life  "Of comfort to a faithful wife  "All that an infant race should save  "Deep buried in a wat'ry grave  "Yet conscious rectitude of heart  "Can marvellous relief impart  "To the endurings of that breast  "Where guilt was never known a guest  "And innocence precludes despair  "Tho' woe a while may harbour there  "O had I but the means again  "To 'tempt the fortune of the main  "Hope whispers still I could remove  "The sorrows of the hearts I love"  "And know'st thou not" old EDMUND cried  Who had his pensive course descried  And oft had listen'd to the tale  Which HOWEL squander'd in the gale  "Hast thou not heard to whom pertain  "The acres of that rich domain  "Which o'er yon fertile summit spreads  "And wide commands th' adjacent meads  "There daily charities proclaim  "To all around good ALCON's name  "When have the friendless or the poor  "Pass'd unreliev'd from ALCON's door  "When did the orphan's piteous cry  "Or plaining age in vain apply  "Freely to each afflicted soul  "He deals a charitable dole  "But chief o'er industry opprest  "He pours the fullness of his breast  "Pleas'd the laborious to sustain  "Whose honest hands have toil'd in vain  "To set the active spirit free  "From scorn that curse of penury  "And bid the wellintending mind  "Regain its rank among mankind  "His bounteous deeds I often hear  "His name and virtues I revere  "But ev'n a stranger to his eye  "How can a wretch like me apply  "My lineage and the name I own  "Alike to ALCON are unknown  "And why should ALCON condescend  "An aliensuff'rer to befriend  "While hundreds near him daily stand  "Who claim the blessings of his hand  "Whose toil hath dress'd his pastures fair  "Or made his herds their duteous care  "While life's advent'rous scene was new  "And golden prospects round me grew  "What numbers did my friendship court  "What numbers proffer me support  "But now the flatt'ring dream is o'er  "Now means and prospects are no more  "Nor have I should thy Lord extend  "His bounteous help one single friend  "Who would my guarantee become  "Should I return successless home  "No GOD and GOD alone must be  "The  needy  man's  security"  Within his eyes big sorrow's tide  Swell'd high and further speech deny'd  Old EDMUND of his woe partook  And left the beach with grieved look  But ere the fall of evening shade  In sorrow to his Lord convey'd  Afflicted HOWEL's fallen state  His various strokes of adverse fate  Which ALCON ponder'd in his breast  While darkness lull'd the world to rest  Soon as the sun with gladsome ray  Illumines the ensuing day  ALCON obscur'd in mean disguise  With EDMUND to the seabeach hies  Poor HOWEL as was wont they find  Sighing his sorrows to the wind  EDMUND his pensive steps pursues  And the preceding theme renews  While ALCON slowly loit'ring near  Partakes it with attentive ear  "Why wilt thou not" old EDMUND cries  "Pursue the measure I advise  "To ALCON thy distress reveal  "He may repair for he can feel"  Again poor HOWEL's doubts outweigh  His hopes as on the former day  He lays anew each sorrow bare  His diffidence and his despair  And as before his plainings end  "I must not to thy words attend  "Not having now one single friend  "Who would my guarantee become  "Lest I return successless home  "No GOD and GOD alone must be  "The  needy  man's  security"  "I  take  thy surety" ALCON cries  "Doffing in haste his rough disguise  "From me thou shalt have means again  "To try thy fortunes on the main  "And GOD and GOD alone shall be  "The  needy  man's  security"  Poor HOWEL tries in vain to speak  Convulsive sobs his utt'rance check  With bursting tears at length bedew'd  Tears only spoke his gratitude  When ALCON O how meek the mind  Thus by benevolence refin'd  The gen'rous ALCON turn'd aside  As tho' his grace he strove to hide  While such a joy dilates his heart  As goodness only can impart  Such joy as they alone can know  "Who feel the blessings they bestow"  Not only stores of merchandize  His large munificence supplies  But to console the advent'rer's mind  For his dear mourners left behind  He vows their guardian to become  Till HOWEL shall review his home  Their parting sigh their sad embrace  Allay'd by such transcendant grace  Once more the merchant rears the sail  Greeting with smiles the rising gale  And as he quits the less'ning shores  Repeated pray'rs for ALCON pours  Five tedious years have now gone o'er  And bless'd him with a wond'rous store  Beyond ev'n hope's extent his gains  Have recompens'd his anxious pains  Now his return his thought employs  Now he anticipates the joys  At honour'd ALCON's foot to lay  His bounteous loanto wipe away  The tears a sorrowing wife had shed  To raise her sad declining head  And with returning comfort cheer  His little ones now doubly dear  His newaccumulated hoard  Within one precious casket stor'd  With care he seals and on the case  That nothing might the mark efface  Not ev'n the brine of dashing waves  His benefactor's name  engraves  This done the crew with joy behold  The canvas to the wind unfold  Serenely placid is the air  The point for England fresh and fair  Smoothly the vessel cuts the seas  And HOWEL's mind is wrapp'd in ease  Thus gently sunk each closing day  Thus brightly beam'd each dawning ray  Till one sad mornWhen HOWEL scar'd  From slumber to the deck repair'd  And saw alas the twilight grey  Presage of rising storms betray  The struggling light in vain essays  T' advancethick clouds obstruct its rays  A second midnight seems to reign  The blast howls dire athwart the main  And in one mighty torrent tost  The vessel bulges on the coast  The wish'd for coast the precious bay  Where all his dearest comforts lay  Quick springs the leak it swells amain  And hope of human aid is vain  Lo HOWEL of his wealth possess'd  With dread of instant death oppress'd  Kneels and with supplicating eye  "Oh wonderworking Pow'r on high  "Grant this last pray'r this store command  "Secure to reach the blessed strand  "Where ALCON dwells" then frantic gave  The precious casket to the wave  When roaring floods with instant sweep  Whelm'd vesselallwithin the deep  Soon as the tempest's rage was o'er  And Ocean ceas'd his hideous roar  What time the yielding gloom made way  For the faint beams of op'ning day  ALCON whose sympathizing mind  Shar'd in the woes of all mankind  Had to the blust'ring seabeach hied  As wont his servants by his side  From sacrilegious hands to save  What wreckdeliver'd want might crave  Such objects straight the seas unfold  As wound his feelings to behold  For every newadvancing wave  Some added sight of horror gave  Here human bodies swoll'n in death  There gasping in their latest breath  Who sore their dimming eyeballs strain  Tow'rd land they ne'er must reach again  While ALCON with Compassion's eye  Roams o'er this scene of misery  The sculptur'd casket strikes the shore  Which held the shipwreck'd HOWEL's store  And as the ebbing waves retreat  The casket lies at ALCON's seet  With eager haste and wild surprize  Into the strange contents he pries  Scarce had he spied the mass within  And HOWEL's grateful tribute seen  When a newrising billow waft  That suff'rer  clinging to a raft  Rais'd and recover'd on the strand  He views his store in ALCON's hand  Equal amazement equal joy  Alternately their minds employ  When HOWEL thus with eyes uprear'd  "Was then my supplication  beard  "Involv'd in danger and despair  "I breath'd one short but fervent pray'r  "My  all  then trusted to the sea  "That all  the waves have brought to thee  "And rescued from the threat'ning main  "I bathe thy honour'd hand again  ALCON replies "Thy tears give o'er  "In silence wonder and adore  "Of this thy wealth I claim no part  "My payment is  thy greatful heart  "With whatsoe'er thou'rt here possess'd  "Go bless thy  dear ones  and be bless'd  "'T was not the wildlyrolling sea  "A HAND UNSEEN brought this to me  "HIS WHO WAS THY SECURITY"  TALE THE SEVENTH  WHAT IS IS BEST OR THE  TALE OF ALVAREZ  What can make a
