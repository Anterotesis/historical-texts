Letterwriting as any private Gentle∣man need be You see I confine myself to Privates for Statesmen and Secretaries methinks should be allowed some greater Degree of La∣titude for their Displeasures on this Head as being more perpetually tormented with it You'll find by my Date where my Quarters are I have been here about a Week just  Time enough to assist at the Recep∣tion of your Brother who arrived but a Day after me He was fol∣lowed on Tuesday last by two maiden Aunts of Sir  Thorobred  's who live together at  York  and were so obliging as to favour  Foxhall  with their Company 'till this Morning when they left us which I believe their ungracious Nephew is not very sorry for What a Tribe of Aunts he has Two at  York  two at  Woodstock  all Virgins and a fifth at last married and settled in  Essex  after having lived in fear of the Apes for above these twenty Years  I spent an incomparable Evening yesterday which perhaps you would not have suspected when you hear who were our Party It consisted of Miss  Rugg  her two Aunts afore∣said  your Brother strongly con∣trasted by  Tom Fetlock  who is now in Possession of the Living the Baronet and Myself Sir  Thorobred  having tired himself with Lunging a young Stonehorse in the Morn∣ing suffer'd the Conversation to turn upon general Topics and Newspaper Intelligences only re∣serving to himself the Liberty of putting in a Sentence now and then as he thought proper Having dis∣patched the common Business of Weather and remarked without Reflection that such a day had been excessive cold or intensely hot or wet or dry or neither without any Regard to the Matter of Fact which indeed was not necessary as the acquiescing Spirit of the Com∣pany entirely agreed in whatever  the first Person advanced however the Common Sense and Acceptation of Words might suffer by their Politeness we proceeded to touch a little upon  American  Matters and the Behaviour of a late Reverend Criminal at his Execution Alas poor Doctor cried Aunt  Dorothy  who for some Time had been nod∣ding over her SnuffBox whilst the Combination of Snivel and Rappee streamed its Chocolate Defluxions down her Handkerchief Poor Man Well they say he made a fine End Why my dear Madam cried Sir  Thorobred  yawning He entered at the Post didn't he and I'm told there was a dead Heat Tho' some indeed pretend that he was smuggled over to  France  which I don't believe a Word of Why  I was there says  Fetlock  who af∣fects to be a Cockfighter and I never in my Life saw any Man die better Game than he did aye and struck to the last To be sure he wheel'd at first a little but say what they will your wheeling Cocks always fight the best Battle What say you  Thorobred  Miss  Rugg  smiled the old Ladies sniffed and wiped their Noses and the Captain relaxing his Features agreeably took out his Toothpickcase and began playing with the Contents of it  I have told you that I arrived here about a Week ago but have not mentioned a Mistake I had nearly fallen into On getting out of my Chaise I saw a tall young Fellow standing in the Yard with  dark Hair cropt short a narrowbrimm'd RoundHat bound with black Ferret upon his Head and his  tout Ensemble  exactly corres∣ponding with my Ideas of a Groom or a Stableboy Not happening to think of  Fetlock  I was just me∣ditating a Salutation of "Holla my Lady" to ask his Assistance in bringing in my Luggage when he turned round and thereby saved me an Infinity of Confusion and Apo∣logies which I should otherwise Infallibly have intailed upon myself His Dress was a light Grey Coat with black Buttons an outer Waist∣coat of green and white striped Cotton under which as it was open at the Breast I could descry at least seven Flannel ones faced with as many Scraps of different coloured  Sattins a Pair of Fustian Breeches with a Profusion of String at the Kneebands white thread Stockings a coloured Silk Handkerchief round his Neck and an Hook'dStick in his Hand  Having suppressed my intended Exclamation I accosted him as a Gentleman and made some feeble Efforts towards entering into an equine Conversation which how∣ever I soon found my utter Incapa∣city of Supporting being in less than five Minutes so completely be∣wildered with a Variety of Cant Phrases and Technical Terms that I was obliged to change the Subject for one more generally Intelligible During this Time Sir  Thorobred  was at some Distance in a Field earnestly examining the Heel of one  of his Hunters which  Fetlock  told me was gorged a little and as he was upon his Hands and Knees with his Hair hanging loose about his Shoulders he exhibited methought no unapt Representation of King  Nebuchadnezzar  at Grass towards the End of his seven Years Meta∣morphosis Nor was the Similitude at all diminished by his nearer Ap∣proach to us For  his Dwelling had been with the Beasts of the Field and his Body was wet with the Dew of Heaven and his Beard was grown like Eagles Feathers and his Nails like Birds Claws  Upon his coming up to us I re∣ceived from him an honest hearty downright Welcome exemplified or rather expressed by a violent Blow  on the Shoulder and such a Shake by the Hand as exposed the Oeco∣nomy of my Bones and Cartilages to intolerable Jeopardy and which indeed nothing but the Extremity of Friendship would have induced me to submit to as his Paws were by no means exempt from the Nastiness attendant on Farriery Having however survived the Sa∣  tation without material Injury we all three adjourned to his Study as he has thought proper to denomi∣nate it And indeed upon Reflection I think he has much Reason on his Side tho' probably without being sensible of it  Cicero  if you remember defines Studium or Study to be the Attention and Ap∣plication of the Mind to some one particular Object And therefore  tho' the Name of a Study or Re∣pository for such Things as may assist us in this Pursuit usually conveys the Idea of a Room parti∣cularly devoted to Books and Lite∣rature inasmuch as the Studium of the generality of People tends that Way yet it is equally applicable to a Room equipp'd in any Manner whatsoever provided that Manner bears the same Affinity to the Stu∣dium of its Possessor Whether our Friend's did you shall be your own Judge The Size of the Room you know is small with two Win∣dows a Door and a Fireplace The literary Part of its Furniture consisted of a pretty considerable Quantity of old Newspapers Ma∣gazines Racing Calendars and Lists of Running Horses which  entirely occupied the Window Seats and invellop'd the greatest Part of the Floor On his Table was a  Bartlett  's Farriery garnished with Spurs Spurleathers and a Boot∣jack and the Remains of  Euclid  's Elements without a Cover which he informed me was going the Way of all its University Companions being constantly made Use of at his Cloacinean Sacrifices His Chimney was decorated with Jockey Whips perpendicularly suspended from their Thongs and every other Part of the Walls seemed loaded with an astonishing Variety of Curbs Snaffles Cavessons and Mar∣tingals with five thousand other Instruments of Equestrian Utility full as curious and entertaining to me as the Weapons of  New Zea∣land  or  Otaheite  or the old Bando∣leers and Shot Pouches in the Ar∣moury in the  Tower  As it wanted some Hours to Dinner we agreed that a Bottle of Strong Beer and some Slices of cold Ham would not be unseasonable These were procured and dispatched speedily after which I retired to Dress my∣self as did my two Companions to try a young Horse of  Fetlock  's at the Leaping Bar  Miss  Rugg  and your Brother seem to find each other exceedingly agree∣able and if I may presume to pro∣phesy will not be averse in due Time to a Junction of Forces The Captain's Method of Attack is not of the most vigorous Nature but I dare say is a very sure and judicious One He seems to enter∣tain  the same Idea of marrying a Wife that he would of purchasing an House or a Farm I don't mean Venally but he seems to consider it as a serious Bargain to be made which must be abided by and would therefore chuse as thorough an Ac∣quaintance with the Nature of his Purchase as possible This is all very right I dare say  Charles  but I cannot be so exceeding methodi∣cal upon the Occasion I cannot help admitting a little of the vola∣tilized Spirit of Love into my Com∣position whereas he conducts him∣self with a calm settled Resolution never suffering any Flames or Darts to enter his Head on the Occasion Not that I consider myself as a dying Strephon with Willows and Billows and Pillows to recline on  nor yet as a hot frantic Firebrand full of Jealousy and Madness com∣mitting Extravagancies one Minute on purpose to beg Pardon for them the next nor in short any way al∣tered in the usual Tenor of my Be∣haviour by the Fascination of Fe∣male Attractions At least I hope not for they say People in Love are blind to the Absurdities of their own Conduct Pray tell me there∣fore in Friendship if you discover any Thing in my Letters at all savouring of  Bedlam  or whether you should think it necessary to consult  Monro  or  Battie  upon the Occasion  Hei mihi quod nullis Amor est medicabilis Herbis  said  Apollo  the Head of the College of Physicians a good many Years ago  when he was desperately unsuccess∣ful in some Love Affair and rather desponding and low about it How∣ever he speaks only of the Vege∣table World so perhaps since the Introduction of Minerals into Me∣dicine a poor Lover's Case may not be quite so Immedicable In Ex∣pectation of your Opinion on this Head I remain my dear  Charles  Yours sincerely W EASY  Captain  MELMOTH  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq  Foxhall  July  My dear Brother  IT would perhaps be needless to say any thing about the Heat of the Weather to you did I not in∣tend to employ it as the Excuse for my epistolary Omissions Upon m  Honour it has been too intense for these last ten Days to attempt any thing particularly so laborious a Business as that of Letterwriting My Hours here pass on very smoothly calm and unruffled unless by the occasional Vocifera∣tion of my good Baronet who is eternally abusing me because I  sometimes read Italian and avow∣edly proclaim my Detestation of the Smell of Horsedung I guess you have heard how much I am deter∣mined upon marrying his Sister She is a very good Girl and I think may contribute to make me more comfortable than I am at present So I have been laying regular Siege to her Heart and Understanding ever since my Arrival and I believe with considerable Success Sir  Thorobred  approves of it in his Way as much as I can wish him I approve of it highly our Fortunes are sufficient to authorize the Step and in short nothing is wanted but her Consent absolute for I consider her tacit as given already and her Uncle's Approbation to conclude our Treaty What think you  Charles  Shall I do well  Ex nitido fieri Rusticus  To change my Red Coat with Lace for an unornamented Brown one and without becoming Savage or Grazier to endeavour at getting my Health in a quiet family Way and raising Children for the Defence of my Country in future instead of personally fighting for it at present I have told you already that my Time passes very smoothly but I will give you a Description of my daily Labours and let you judge for yourself I generally rise about Seven and stroll into the Garden with my constant Companion Lord  Chesterfield  Here we walk for about an Hour entertaining ourselves with each other's Conversation and every two or three Turns perhaps stopping to take a View of Sir  Thorobred  who is deeply engaged on the other Side of the Hedge in the elegant Occupation of breaking two young Horses for his Phaeton and haranguing his Friend  Fetlock  who attends with a long Whip in his Hand in all the Mode and Figure of Equestrian Vulgarity  Entre nous  this  Fetlock  is some∣times a most intolerable Fatigue to me The Baronet is at least a ra∣tional Savage and will sometimes divert and be entertaining even upon the Subject of his own Oddities but his Chaplain or Aid du Camp is insipid to the most distressing Degree Sir  Thorobred  often at∣tempts to better my Opinion of him by informing me what an honest goodnatured Fellow he is and far be it from me to say other∣wise  It would be cruel to detract from the Merits of a Person who can so very ill afford it 'twere like robbing a poor Beggar of his Halfpenny But still 'tis hard one must be condemned to suffer his Com∣pany He never commits even a laughable Absurdity unless by mere Accident The most ridiculous Anecdote I ever heard concerning him and that too by the Contri∣vance of Sir  Thorobred  was his fall∣ing asleep at  Foxhall  after a Drink∣ing Match on Saturday Afternoon and continuing in that Situation till the Monday Morning I believe it was not above a Week before my Arrival when he waked about Eight o'Clock perfectly Sober dressed himself breakfasted took his Horse out of the Stable and de∣parted  very quietly with his Sermon in his Pocket to officiate at his Parish Church which is about a Mile distant Upon his Arrival there however not finding any Ap∣pearance of a Congregation he rode twice round the Churchyard kicked stoutly at the Vestry Door damned his Clerk and Parishioners  parately and altogether for a Parcel of negligent Heathens and returned perfectly satisfied that  he  had at least performed  his  Duty and paid a due Reverence to the Sanctity of the Sabbath  Well after Breakfast Charles I attach myself to Miss  Rugg  ride or walk out with her and Discourse of my Exploits in  America  Of Battles Sieges Fortunes  Of moving Accidents by Flood and Field  Of hairbreadth 'Scapes i'th' imminent deadly Breach  and so on 'till like another  Des∣demona  she almost  Loves me for the Dangers I have past  And I love her that she does Pity them  For in Truth many of them were very worthy of Pity and such as I will not undergo again whilst the Enemy keep on their own Side the Atlantic Many Times  Charles  during our Confinement in  Boston  have I worn the same Shirt for three Days together lived invariably upon Rice and Salt Pork and when at length the Place was evacuated I was absolutely reduced to my last Pint of Lavender Water Some∣times these Conversations are bro∣ken  in upon by Sir  Thorobred  who enquires whether we could turn our Horses to Grass there and how much a Load I supposed our Hay might cost Government Apropos of Sir  Thorobred  He always wears his Hat in the House and has be∣sides an uncivilized Custom of throwing his Legs into the Seat of any Chair that happens to stand near him if empty or if occu∣pied he entangles his Boots and Spurs so effectually with the Bars of it as to expose the Stockings of his Neighbour to unavoidable Destruction and his Body to im∣minent Danger of a Fall I was sitting next to him yesterday Even∣ing when he entertained himself in this Manner Presently I rose from my Chair in which as I ex∣pected  his Legs immediately posted themselves Sir  Thorobred  said I that Chair I left for your Hat to lie in and  Apropes de Botes  ring∣ing the Bell I am now going to give Orders that the gouty Cradle may be brought to support your Legs which I should think a much properer Place for them He stared for half a Minute in my Face damn'd me for an odd Fellow flung his Hat into the Middle of the Room called for his Slippers and begging I would lend him my Pocketglass began digging his Jawbone with his Horsepicker as composedly as if it had been the Hoof of the Animal it appertained to  Alas poor Brute he is utterly incorrigible I believe I have seve∣ral  Times attempted persuading him to keep his Nails within some toler∣able Bounds of civilized Longitude for at present they are entirely in a State of unimproved Nature full as Extensive and infinitely less De∣licate than the Talóns of a Chinese Mandarin but I have not the Happiness of discovering the least Shadow of Improvement arising from it Ah  Thorobred  thou art a well meaning Fellow But  my Dear Baronet    Adieu  Charles  Yours  George Melmoth  CHARLES MELMOTH  to  WILLIAM EASY  Melmoth Place  July  My Dear Easy  I AM sorry to write on a Subject which I doubt not will sensibly afflict you Our poor Friend  Harry  is no more I received a Letter Yesterday from  Ned Freeman  who went Abroad with him informing me of his Decease  Wearied of Life says he before he had well entered into it with a Temper soured by Reflexion and a Consti∣tution ruined by Excess he died unknown and unregarded at  Lisbon  in the twentysecond Year of his Age Except Myself and his  Servant there was not a Soul in the Place that he could speak to We were with him in his last Moments and I declare to you that it was with the utmost diffi∣culty I supported myself through the Scene There is at all Times something inconceivably Awful in that last Agony of convulsed Nature But in the present In∣stance it was particularly so To see him Pale and Emaciated fall∣ing in the Prime of Youth a Sacrifice to his own Imprudence To see every Feature distorted every Nerve striving with its Dissolution and Nature by her strong repeated Struggles loud∣ly exclaiming that her Time was not yet come is a Spectacle too affecting to be looked upon with  Composure It was near three Hours before he breathed his last with his Eyes fixed stedfastly on me and his Hands firmly grasp∣ing one of mine Before you receive this I shall probably be on my Passage to  England  with our poor Friend's Body  Surely  Easy  this is a Mela∣choly History The Inattention of his Guardians and the certain Prospect of an immense Fortune immediately upon his coming of Age were the Cause of his Mis∣fortunes Happy had it been for him if his Father had lived a few Years longer It is amazing too how greatly his Manner of Life had altered his Disposition He had latterly lost all that Mirth that Ease and Gaiety of Heart which  rendered his Company so universal∣ly desireable and was become peev∣ish and dissatisfied with every thing I never shall forget what he said to me as we were sitting together in his DressingRoom but a few Weeks before he went Abroad I think it was the last Conversation we ever had together  Melmoth  says he I am Unhappy I am sick of my Follies and almost wearied of my Life I enter into Company without Enjoying it I frequent public Places but they are become Indifferent and Irk∣some to me Nothing amuses me I wish I had lived as you have  Melmoth  To quit a Subject so unpleasant let me enquire a little into your  Course of Employment at  Foxhall  For Instance how do you spend your Mornings do you ride or walk or sit at Home and read those curious Tracts which you say Sir  Thorobred  's Study abounds with I should think with a little Application under so excellent a Master you might soon acquire a very competent Stock of Theore∣tical Horsemanship I never pre∣sume to expect anything considera∣ble from you in the practical Parts A few Days ago I received Advices from  George  giving such satisfac∣tory Accounts of his amatorial Progresses that I expect every News∣paper to read Particulars of the Marriage I am heartily glad to find Matters in so fair a Train with him because I think he will do a  much wiser Thing in marrying an amiable Girl with a good Fortune than in returning to live upon SaltBeef and Honour in  America  I have a Wife  Easy  and I want to see all my Friends in the same Situ∣ation which believe me is a much more comfortable one than many silly People imagine With due Compliments to the Inhabitants of  Foxhall  in general and that Cen∣taur Sir  Thorobred  in particular I remain  Yours ever  Charles Melmoth  WILLIAM EASY  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Foxhall  July  Dear Melmoth  YOUR melancholy Account of our Friend's Decease gives me much Concern Poor  Harry  I am sincerely sorry for him Not that he is Dead for I do not think Death a Thing to be lamented nor yet that he died in the Prime of Life 'Tis not his End but the Causes and Manner of it the unhappy Course of Dissipation which occa∣sioned it and the Stain  that  may throw upon a Character in itself truly amiable which I grieve for But I will not trouble you with a  Detail of Reflexions on this Head as I have thrown them into a few elegiac Stanzas to disbuthen my Mind a little of a Subject which I could not help dwelling upon These I send to you in Confidence So far however from wishing tho' I have disposed them in the Man∣ner of an Epitaph that they should be inscribed on his Monument that I even would not chuse they should be seen by any Person except those few Friends who can drop a Tear of Pity when they chance to think of his Failings but will al∣ways honour his Memory for the Goodness and Excellence of his Heart  In Memoriam Infelicis Juvenis  Here sleeps a Martyr to illicit Love  The Breast that once each nobler Feeling fir'd  The Mind that Virtue's Self might well approve  Had Prudence check'd what amorous Youth in∣spir'd  Pure were his Thoughts and innocent his Joys  But early Wealth seduc'd his easy Soul  Soft Scenes of Pleasure seem'd to court his Choice  And Youth and Nature sicken'd at Controul  Each varied Luxury of Sense was there  That Art could form or Fancy's Pow'rs design  Fair laugh'd the Feast with mirthful Freedom fair  And Beauty crown'd th' imperfect Joys of Wine  Alas How soon th' illusive Pageant Flies  Dark Clouds of Death obscure his dawning Day  In a strange Land unknown unwept he Lies  A dreadful Warning to the Young and Gay  Unknown Unwept Save where the secret Tear  Steals in sad Silence from the Muse's Eyes  Lest wrinkled Age injuriously severe  Should wrong his Follies with the Name of Vice  But ye Wild Partners of my hapless Friend  Pass not unheedful by this sacred Stone  And when your heaving Breasts would mourn his End  Mourn for his Frailties and correct your own  Adieu my poor inconsiderate Friend  The earth that Bears Thee dead  Bears not alive so brave a Gentleman  Adieu and take thy Praise with thee to Heav'n  Thy Ignominy sleep with thee in the Grave  But not remember'd in thy Epitaph  And now  Melmoth  let me An∣swer your Questions concerning Myself and my Amusements In the first Place then all my odd HalfHours which are a good ma∣ny are devoted to the Study of  Tooke's Pantheon  and the  Nomina Propria  in  Ainsworth's  Dictionary Can you conceive any thing more  edifying But I read them to re∣fresh my Memory and prepare myself more fully for an heathenish Stile of Conversation with  Pedant  if he should happen to spend the Summer with us at  Hartley's  The Books lie upon the Floor in Sir  Thorobred's  Study from whence Drafts are made occasionally to be employed in the same Services as his  Euclid's  Elements and indeed I find their Pages suffer such con∣siderable Decrease that I am obliged to Study very vigorously in order to keep up with him in his Con∣sumption Then I sometimes ride after Breakfast but "Soberly" as Lady  Grace  says Not in the fran∣tic whip and cut Stile of a  Nimrod  nor with the more dignified Pom∣posity of the Manege like a King  William  the Third in old Tapestry And then if any Log or broken Hurdle or Furzebush should sprout up in my Way I never risque the whole Army at once but pass it in two Divisions  Videlicet  myself first as being of the great∣est Consequence and afterwards my Cavalry Or sometimes if the Passage should be very much ob∣structed I place my Horse in the Van as Pioneer or Forlorn Hope and bring up myself as the sustain∣ing Party You know which he is Sir  Thorobred's  old Grey Poney I can tell you we are very great Friends Age and Experience have cooled down all the little Tricks and Vanities which more youthful Qua∣drupeds are subject to and as each pays the most punctilious Regard to  his own particular Safety we are excessively cautious of Hazarding anything that might break the Bond of Union between us I fear how∣ever we shall be under the Neces∣sity of Parting in a Day or two as my Time of Furlow is nearly elaps∣ed and old  Hartley  will begin to be impatient for the Execution of his University Plans  Vale Charles  believe me  Yours W EASY  Miss  HARTLEY  to Miss  RUGG  HillStreet  July  WELL my cunning reserved little Madam I have heard of all your Coquetries to ensnare the poor  Melmoth  though you have not thought fit to write to me since his Arrival amongst you Indeed I think you might have found some spare half Hour to scribble in and acquaint me a little how Matters went on especially as you had declared your Intentions with such a pretty blushing Bashfulness in your last Letter Upon my Honour you deserve to be plagued a little  Should nothing Material prevent I shall probably spend great Part  of the Summer with my Brother as he seems to wish much for my Company  How very pretty and sisterlike that was of you wasn't it But then  We  are not without Hopes of seeing Captain  Melmoth  How that comes stealing in as if it thought to escape unobserved And presently it is  Somehow or other  I  wish he may come down to us  How we have changed by Degrees from the Plural to the Singular And then in the next Sentence  He is such an agree∣able Man and so ready to do as I please with  O you little Gipsey They may talk as they please but I'll be hanged if one such little Puritan as yourself won't cost a Lover more  Pains and Attendance and give him more Plague aye and play him more Tricks too than half a Dozen of us madheaded ones And then to put yourself to the Trouble of telling a naughty Story and denying it and afterwards running into the lovesick Strain so artfully as if you had forgot that you were writ∣ing about your Brother  Indeed I must in Charity believe that you did it all on Purpose or I shall never have any Mercy on you But you should really have written to me For my Part I have nothing but Scribbling to amuse me at present  Easy  as you may guess by the Time of his leaving  Foxhall  came here but  Tuesday  and this Morning he was packed up in a Postchaise with my Father  and transported to  Oxford  in pur∣suit of my Spouse and Tutor elect Poor Fellow I dare say he could have found a Better without the Expence of Travelling in search of him However he is gone and his poor disconsolate  Kitty  has no other Business but to  Wake and Weep  and read Novels by Lamplight all Night and to write Letters and accompany despairing Ditties with her Piano Forte all Day However I made him swear eternal Fidelity and so forth in the true Stile of Chivalry before his Departure to that Country of Ne∣cromancers and Inchanters whom he promises to destroy and spare not unless they acknowledge the incomparable Princess he worships to be the very Flower and Paragon  of Perfection nay he farther en∣gages that he will make them appear in due Form as Slaves be∣fore my Footstool saying  I am the profound Metaphysician and Logician Puzzlearius Governor of the College of A B who being vanquished by the superior Valour and Arguments c c  I fancy he will find this Task ra∣ther difficult for by the Specimen I have seen I believe the odd Things would rather forfeit all Pretensions to Chivalry and every Thing else than endure the Terror of passing five Minutes in a Woman's Com∣pany in which Time at farthest they must have emptied their whole Budget of Conversation To speak seriously though I have no Idea of  Pedant  's being prevailed upon  to return with them by any Argu∣ments whatsoever If he should not my Father's Plan of Operations for the present at least will be en∣tirely deranged and before he can form any new Ones  Easy  is to chop Logic quote Greek bring him into a good Humour after Dinner and then having recounted his numer∣ous Services and unparallel'd Dis∣interestedness ask my Hand of him in Form If on the Contrary the Pedantic Animal's Avarice or some other strange Infatuation should prompt him to hazard a long Vaca∣tion in  Dorsetshire  why he will be a delightful Subject to exercise one's ill Humours upon and after having stayed there 'till every Idea has been ridiculed out of him he may return Home to be the laugh∣ing  Stock of his Fellow Savages and leave  Easy  in peaceable Posses∣sion of the Victory and the Prize for I don't doubt my Father's Good∣ness if we can but once drive this nonsensical Chimera out of his Head  Oh I must tell you now tho' whilst I think of it what a Sacri∣fice  Easy  has made at my Shrine and what Incense he has been offer∣ing to that dear favourite Foible of ours Vanity He begged indeed an assuming Fellow That I would not communicate them to any body but we Women you know never can conceal these Matters from each other tho' I really do not think you deserve them after the sly Stile of Secrecy which you would have adopted towards me if your  Pen would have suffer'd you How∣ever if you will beg Pardon and be a good Girl I'll not keep you any longer in Suspence They are two languishing Epistles the Pro∣duce of an unalterable Passion which he sustained in his younger Days for a Lady whom he calls  Delia  and to whom he is distantly re∣lated  As  Delia  's Papa and Mama lived entirely in the Country the young People had not met since they were Children and  Colin  's Parents for so he calls himself having no very good Opinion of Miss  Delia  had often described her to him in a Manner not the most favourable One Summer however they re∣solved to pay old Mr  Delia  a Month's or six Weeks Visit and it  being Vacation Time with young Mr  Colin  who was then of the University he of course accom∣panied them And then it was that the superlative Excellence and Goodness of Miss  Delia  struck him through the Liver Poor Man he was in a sad Way about it for Miss Delia tho' she treated him very kindly was unluckily engaged already to a Man of very consider∣able Fortune and when after some Time he attempted to prefer his Suit she revealed to him the State of the Case and shewed him one or two Letters from her other Lover Mr  Corydon  which entirely drove poor  Colin  to Desperation Then it fortunately happened that instead of hanging or drowning himself as a downright ignorant  Fellow would have done in similar Circumstances Poetry came to his Aid and he presented her with the first Epistle  Soon▪ afterwards she became Mrs  Corydon  and within a Month more the inexorable Parcae cut down her Husband Upon this not hav∣ing Leisure to Versify lest any other Claimant would step in before him he had nothing for it but to admi∣nister Comfort as early as possible in plain Prose and endeavour to bring himself upon the  Tapis  again She however is utterly In∣consolable and after having got the Funeral over and taken a little time for Consideration absolutely determines upon a perpetual Retire∣ment and Seclusion from the World in General This you may ima∣gine  produces a second Piece of Poetry from her Inamorato longer than the first wherein after having said a great many fine Things and attack'd her with a Profusion of Morality and Sentiment he con∣siders himself as bound in common Politeness to imitate her illustrious Example pitches upon a very pretty Cave for the Place of his Retire∣ment and resolves to surrender his Body to Tears and Meditations whilst living and to Fleshflies and Jackdaws after he is dead without Benefit of Clergy or Christian Bu∣rial In consequence of these pious Determinations on both Sides she is married within a Twelvemonth to a Man old enough to be her Grandfather but with a very large Fortune and he having amused  himself for several Years amongst the Groves and Solitude of the  Temple  Gardens is at present just as I would have him be  I have inclosed the two Pieces of Poetry which he gave me the Prose I was only suffer'd to read before he burnt them  Adieu my dear  Rugg  Believe me your very affectionate CATHARINE HARTLEY  COLIN  to  DELIA  On her approaching Marriage with  CORYDON  READ or O say have present Joys effac'd  Each Thought each fond Remembrance of the past  Can that blest Rival censure one sad Sigh  One transient Tear to me and Misery  Read nor with cold Severity reprove  Th' unconquer'd Struggles of distracted Love  Grant one last Look of Comfort to my Grief  One sympathetic Strain of sad Relief  Then all my Woes in dark Oblivion drown  And yield thy Soul to Bliss and  Corydon  Curst be the HourNobe it ever blest  When first thy Beauty struck my'astonish'd Breast  The wild Luxuriance of thine auburn Hair  Thy Mien majestic Face divinely fair  Seem'd like th' ideal Phantom of a Dream  I saw I wonder'd but could not esteem  Vile Prejudice with bigotted Controul  Check'd every nobler Feeling of my Soul  Still in my Ear base Slander whisper'd Lies  Beheld Vivacity and nam'd it Vice  Did any dare applaud your Wit or Sense  'Twas sneering Satire all and Impudence  Gods how I err'd could I thus grossly Sin  Or think so fair a Form so foul within  Thus think of her whose Virtues now I see  And Honour almost to Idolatry  Yet how sincerely I bewail'd my Crimes  And curst th' unfeeling Malice of the Times  Curst my weak Heart that could so soon believe  Such Excellence was made but to deceive  Bear witness Heav'n and thou fair Maid forgive  For whom alone I can endure to live  Forgive this Error 'tis my last Request  Then welcome Solitude my Mind's at rest  Scarce had three Suns their daily Circuit ran  And the fourth Morn reveal'd its Light to Man  When with full Radiance on my dazzled Sense  Beam'd forth the Wonders of your Excellence  There veil'd in all the Sprightliness of Youth  Sat meekeyed Modesty and honest Truth  There calm Religion reign'd with sweet Controul  The Sanctity of Thought and Snow of Soul  Their heav'n descended Influence there combin'd  To prove thy Face less beauteous than thy Mind  Slander beheld and shudd'ring with Affright  Plung'd headlong 'midst the Shades of endless Night  Ah me whilst yet I breath my mournful Strain  Fresh Woes arise and aggravate my Pain  Fix'd in my tortur'd Mind's distracted Waste  Sits Memory 'tween the present and the past  Forming dire Parallels how erst among  The shadowing Grove's dark gloom we rov'd along  Then whilst my Soul dissolv'd in amorous Bliss  Plann'd idle Schemes of endless Happiness  Thy Voice soft soothing flatter'd my Desire  Rouz'd every Sense and fill'd my Breast with Fire  Thus rapt in Extacy my Moments past  Ah Extacy too wonderful to last  When one curst Hour one blasting Stroke of Fate  Down hurl'd me from my Pinnacle of State  Snatch'd every vain ideal Hope of Bliss  And whelm'd me deep in Woe's extreme Abyss  Unfeeling Maid by such harsh Means to prove  The boundless Influence of Almighty Love  Had those sad Papers been at first reveal'd  Or ever from my cheated Sight conceal'd  One last Farewell one heartbreaking Adieu  Had torn my struggling Soul from Love and you  Or still of happy Ignorance possest  I had enjoy'd a visionary Rest  Till shudd'ring with Astonishment and Fear  Loud nuptial Hymns had pierc'd my'affrighted Ear  And as with Lightning blasted my strange Doom  Had sunk me deep deep in the Grave's dark Womb  Think not I seek to interrupt your Joys  Upbraid your Conduct or condemn your Choice  My Happy Rival boasts far nobler Birth  Vows earlier plighted and superior Worth  Propitious Fortune bless'd his Natal Hour  And  Plutus  hail'd him in a golden Show'r  Ten thousand Heifers o'er his Pastures rove  My only Wealth was Competence and Love  NoCould you pitying as these Lines you see  Bid me still live to Happiness and Thee  Could you for me unmindful of your Vows  Burst from th' Embraces of your promis'd Spouse  For me in some lone Cot consent to dwell  And bid your Country and your Friends farewell  Wretch tho' I am the Prize I'd still forego  Nor wish such Joys e'en to my deadliest Foe  Live long and happy nor disturb your Bliss  With one sad Thought of  Colin  's Wretchedness  Or should soft Pity prompt you still to bear  The Memory of a Youth you once held dear  Still grant me your Esteem since Love must end  And tho' the Wife be lost remain the Friend  COLIN  to  DELIA  On the Death of  CORYDON  Written at the University  IF from these gloomy Walls these antique Tow'rs  Where meagre Study wastes the midnight Hours  Where Pedant Learning sits severe nor knows  The Anguish of an hopeless Lover's Woes  Yet  Delia  yet again 'tis giv'n to mourn  Vent all my Griefs nor be receiv'd with scorn▪  Accept these heartfelt Strains nor fear to join  The bitter Sorrows of thy Cup with mine  Mix Tear with Tear heave flow th' alternate Sigh  We may at least unite in Misery  This Step nor Friends nor Fortune Disallows  Nor the pale Phantom of thy shrouded Spouse  O  Corydon  in Life's aspiring bloo  Snatch'd from a Bride's Embraces to the Tomb  Methinks I see thy lingering Spirit fly  And scarce quit her for Heav'n without a Sigh  Methinks I see thee 'midst th' Angelic Choir  Strike the soft Warblings of thy pensive Lyre  With listless Eye th' Aetherial Mansions range  Look sadly down and half regret the Change▪  Rest virtuous Youth supremely blest in Heav'n  Nor scorn this Tribute by a Rival giv'n  No storied Urn no funeral Dirge you need  Vain empty Off'rings to the senseless Dead  Silent be Fame and hush'd be every Voice  Your Worth stands blazon'd by your  Delia  's Choice  Nor thou fair Maid esteem it feign'd that here  I breath sad Strains of Sorrow o'er his Bier  To see thee blest was all my Wish below  The first best Gift God's Bounty could bestow  Those Dreams are fled so cruel Fate decreed  And a long Train of thickening Ills succeed  Rest of your Lord no second you approve  But shrine your Soul in monumental Love  By the pale Tapers dimly glimm'ring Light  Count the long Moments of the tedious Night  Or with slow Step majestically sad  Seek the damp Aisle where his cold Corse is laid  Invoke his Shade to prove your Vow sincere  And bid the World farewell without a Tear  And canst thou  Delia  canst thou waste thy Bloom  In some dark solitudes sequester'd Gloom  Canst thou forget the Honours of thy Race  Say canst thou yield that fair that faultless Face  A Prey to Grief a voluntary Slave  So sweet a Flower to wither o'er a Grave  Noyet again in this World's Pleasures join  Again in all thy fatal Beauty shine  In social Mirth Life's transient Hours employ  Nor sour'd by Grief nor mad with thoughtless joy  On Reason's Rules let every Action move  What she prescribes Religion must approve  Let peevish Dotards bid the World adieu  And censure Joys they can no more pursue  Let Avarice barter Soul and Body's Health  To roll in Piles of solitary Wealth  Let Superstition big with righteous Pride  Pard'ning herself damn all the World beside  With pious Rancour 'gainst Mankind inveigh  And thank her God she is not made as they  Condemn the Blessings by his Mercy giv'n  To smooth this mortal Pilgrimage to Heav'n  'Tis thine to spend thy little Hour on Earth  In social Comforts and becoming Mirth  Catch the World's guiltless Pleasures as they fly  Thankful to live yet not afraid to die  Breath the soft Air of resignation's Gale  Thus speaks thy Friend and let his Voice prevail  And is that all must my Fierce Passions bend  To the cold Names of Monitor and Friend  Can those weak formal empty Titles prove  To what Excess of Misery I love  Ah fond aspiring interested Youth  In vain you preach up Righteousness and Truth  In vain with pious Fraud yourself deceive  And teach your willing Senses to believe  Pretend 'tis pure Religion's Flame you feel  And grace your Passion with the Name of Zeal▪  Nor Grace nor Zeal Love only Fires your Lays  'Tis the Heart dictates and the Hand obeys  Come then in all thy Pride of Beauty come  Pronounce my Sentence stamp my final Doom  ComeLet me clasp thee in my'enraptur'd Arms  Drink in thy matchless Luxury of Charms  With quivering Lips caressing and carest  Rouse the tumultuous Heavings of thy Breast  Then lost in Love and sick'ning with Desire  Sunk on thy Neck triumphantly Expire  Alas how wildly do my Senses rove  Yet who can hope consistency in Love  Is this the Preacher will my  Delia  cry  Is this the Youth of wondrous Piety  The Friend who late with righteous Fervor glow'd  And bade me learn Submission to my God  Taught me his Bounties were not giv'n in vain  To be neglected by desponding Man  And would he now my Peace of Mind destroy  'Midst the rude Transports of illicit Joy  Mar the fair Prospects of my future Life  And bid me stoop to be a Beggar's Wife  O rare Humility best Gift of Heav'n  Sure Means for all my Sins to be forgiv'n  Cease  Delia  cease nor with too hasty Tongue  Condemn the Wretch who never wish'd you wrong  O were the fierce conflicting Struggles known  'Twixt Grace and Love your Welfare and my own  Could you but feel what Seas of Passion roll  And pang with boist'rous Rage my tortur'd Soul  Your gentle Heart would pity not reprove  The hapless Youth whose only Crime was Love  Farewellfrom every Hope of Comfort driv'n  I here devote my future Hours to Heav'n  Far from the Noise and busy Hum of Men  My Soul hath form'd a melancholy Scene  An unfrequented Cave mossy and old  There save the Tinklings of some distant Fold  Or some small Brook high overgrown with Reeds  That Bubbling winds its Waters 'mongst the Weeds  Silence shall reignNo Trace of Man intrude  Upon the still sequester'd Solitude  Unless some hapless Wretch's Skeleton  Who long Time since like me by Love undone  Sought that sad Place out to despair and die  There mixt with his my scatter'd Bones shall lie  There mixt with his in dark Oblivion rot  Alike unwept unhonour'd and forgot  Or should strange Chance some wand'ring Shepherds lead  To these lone Mansions of th' unburied Dead  Shaking their pensive Heads they'll drop a Tear  Of generous Pity on our mossgrown Bier  Then sighing say as the sad Tale they tell  Alas These "Lov'd not wisely but too well"  Mr  HARTLEY  to Sir  ANTHONY ARTICHOKE  HillStreet  July  My dear Sir Anthony  I AM so overjoy'd I am the happiest Man alive All my Schemes have succeeded and I have been down to  Oxford  and have brought up Mr  Pedant  with me and we are as happy and as learned as the Day is long and we are all going down to  Dorsetshire  in a Day or two And now my old Friend since every thing has turned out so prosperously I will let you into the Secret which I talked of in my former Letters and inform you who  has been my Confidant and Assist∣ant in managing this Business I say since every thing has turned out so prosperously for else you know as well as I can tell you that "Least said is soonest mended" and  Bad News always comes fast enough  and the like His Name is  William Easy  a young Man about seven or eight and twenty His Father and I were old School∣fellows and Cronies at  Hackney  to∣gether Poor old  Easy  he used to be sadly troubled with the Gout latterly like myself and went to  Bath  once or twice in a Year con∣stantly And would you believe it the young Fellow his Son found me out when I was there last before I visited  Staples  you know aye and came to Breakfast with me too  and was as glad to see me the young Rogue was as if I had been of his own Age Let them say what they will of the Vices and Follies of the present Race of young Men I am glad to find they are not all so corrupt And he is clever too in the Bargain and has read a good Deal and has seen a good Deal of the World too I dare say which is no harm when it does not interfere with a Man's Learn∣ing Now what Person do you think could be so proper to assist in managing this Business of a Hus∣band for  Kitty  as he was For his Manner of Introducing himself at first to me shewed how disinte∣rested he was and that he came to see me purely because I was so well acquainted with his poor old Father  and what a Regard he had for me upon that Account So I com∣municated all my Intentions to him and he approved of them highly and accompanied me in my Journey to  Oxford  and talked to me about the  Prometheus  of  Aeschylus  and  Aristotle  's Treatise upon Rhetoric by the Hour together as we went along And I have engaged him to come down with me to  Dorset∣shire  to compleat the Affair So Mr  Pedant  and myself I wanted to have persuaded Mr  Pedant  to have gone down in the same Car∣riage with my Daughter by way of making a Beginning you know but he chose rather to go with me So Mr  Pedant  and myself will travel in my Chariot and four and I must make an Apology to  Easy  about going in an hired Chaise with my Daughter and they can keep on before and prepare Things at the Inns for us Do write to me soon and tell me what your Opi∣nion is of all this and believe me to be  Your most faithful Friend  Christopher Hartley  WILLIAM EASY  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Dorsetshire  August  Dear Charles  THAT I have for this Week past intended epistolizing  Melmoth Place  is as certain as that I have omitted doing it and you perhaps would now have been as well satisfied with goodnaturedly taking the Will for the Deed and compounding for my not writing at all However since the Pen is put to Paper you shall have no Reason to complain of my Brevity in Correspondence be your Passion for Letterreading ever so excessive It is now about three Weeks since  I made my Escape from  Oxford  from whence in Conjunction with old  Hartley  I have effected the Pe∣regrination of  Pedant  to this western World A Piece of Success as far beyond my Expectation as my Wishes Indeed I had not the smallest Idea that any thing could have induced him to such a despe∣rate Undertaking and should have been full as well pleased had he been inexorable to our Intreaties for by the frequent Consultations he has held with the old Gentle∣man for these last three or four Days and some other little Inci∣dents I suspect there is more in the Wind than I am aware of How∣ever as I don't feel myself disposed to stand greatly in Awe of their In∣tentions whatever they may be I  shall drop him for the present and commence the Journal or History of our University Expedition  About the Middle of  July  then within two Days after my Return from  Foxhall  to  HillStreet  I was put on board a Postchaise with old  Hartley  about eight o'Clock in the Morning and about Four in the Afternoon found myself with my Companion at the  Cross  Inn  Oxford  As it happened to be during the Time of the Public Act the Town was to∣lerably crouded So having deposited our Baggage in the best Room we could meet with we procured pro∣per Directions to Mr  Pedant  's Chambers and immediately sallied out in Pursuit of them Many and curious were the Figures we en∣countered  in our Way and of all Sizes and Dimensions Several of them I remember'd as my Contem∣poraries with whom in those Days I had been very well acquainted But the Devil or my evil Genius or some strange Circumstance that I was not apprized of had so trans∣formed and disfigured me since that Time that not a Man of them could I prevail upon to remain within Gunshot of me If I ran hollow'd or called them by their Names it served but to increase their Velocity in Retreating They scudded up their Staircases like black Rabbits in a Warren and I believe it was near ten Minutes before I could procure any Crea∣ture to assist me with farther In∣structions towards the Discovery of  Pedant  's Residence At last I had the good Fortune to meet  Tom Frankley  your Neighbour  Har∣borough  's Nephew who is a Gen∣tleman Commoner of the same College He conducted us imme∣diately to the Object of our Pur∣suit and begg'd if I was not already engaged I would call in the Evening and sup with him and bring old  Hartley  with me I told him that I feared Supper would not be in my Power but that I would certainly call upon him about Eight o'Clock though I could not pro∣mise farther So we parted and Mr  Hartley  and myself proceeded up the Staircase towards the Door of  Pedant  's Apartment Unluckily it happened that not thinking of the still Caution necessary in an  Attack of this Sort we advanced carelessly talking as our Vanguard approached the Outworks and thereby effectually excluded our∣selves from all possibility of enter∣ing For just as we turned round the last Landingplace the Vigi∣lance of the Enemy was alarmed the outer Door shut with a thun∣der Clap and all within was silent You may imagine that after this all the Knocking and Noise we could make would be of very little Service so we were obliged to content ourselves for the present with the Supposition that he pro∣bably was busied as old  Hartley  said in some metaphysical Investi∣gation but that he would go there by himself in the Evening and attempt him a second Time by  Surprize This Plan of Proceed∣ing I entirely applauded as it re∣leased me from all the purgatorial Discipline of such a Service and gave me the better Opportunity of Supping with  Frankley  whose Con∣versation tho' less abstruse would probably be more entertaining So having drank our Tea together quietly at the Coffeehouse I left my Companion planning the Mode of his Attack over a Newspaper and went immediately to fulfil my Engagement And most excellently entertained I was both with the Behaviour and Conversation of my Company So much so that with∣out any Apology I shall send you a minute Detail of the whole Bu∣siness which if you find yourself too stupid or lazy to read with due  Attention I desire you will forth∣with send back to me again with all proper Thanks and Acknow∣ledgements Carriage paid  Well to  Frankley  's I went then sat down and having got thro' the first necessary Business of Speechify∣ing and Enquiries was just verging towards a Discourse upon University Matters in general when on a sudden preceded however by an infinite Variety of Tallios Hoicks's hark to Venoms Vipers Vixens Vermins which we perceived gra∣dually increasing from the opposite Side of the Quadrangle the Door flew open and in rushed a Party of Gentlemen who it seems from their particular Attachment to that Species of Cur as well as from the exact Similarity of their Noises  are called the Terriers At the Head of this extraordinary Troop was a Mr  Jack Solecism  who first discover'd his Capability of Arti∣culation by a "Damn that villain∣ous Rascal  Euclid  to * * * * * I wish the Fellow * * * * * * * * and whatever else is usual on such Occasions  This curious Exclamation which having lasted for some Minutes terminated but with the Breath of the Utterer was accompa∣nied by a loud Amen in Cho∣rus from the Rest of the Com∣pany Presently several of them snatched Chairs and threw them∣selves into them for the Benefit of Conversation Well  Frankley  says  Solecism  to my Friend after all this College is a damn'd Place  Here am I now a Fellow allowedly clever preposterously so now and then a little Drunk to be sure why they puzzle and torture me at their Examinations worse than a rich Criminal in an Inquisition Strike me sober if I know whether their Examinations are most like an In∣quisition or a Bullbait And the Rascals are true bred Dogs too every one of them they run all at the Head 'till a Man's Brain be∣comes as confused as a Bankrupt's Account Books However I keep my Head up and then they can't pin me  An old Lord of the Council rated me the other Day in the Street but I marked him not and yet he talked very wisely and in the Street too  But I regarded him not I am unhurt in  the midst of them like  Daniel  in the Den of Lions Aye or in the fiery Furnace cried another at the same Instant catching his Chair from under him with a Velo∣city that tilted him Headforemost into the Grate O damn the Ex∣pence of a fiery Furnace cried a Third Expence is nothing Trou∣ble's all bellowed a Fourth Back him up fan him spilt dish'd all abroad wound up sha'n't be bad not of the two a few or so all abroad abroad abroad Here Articulation ended and was succeeded by their former Canine Conversation with which they quitted or to use their own Ex∣pression  dangled out of  the Room  As soon as they were gone  Frankley  began entering into some  Sort of Dissertation on the Cha∣racters of these Incomprehensibles explained to me their Stile of Life their Amusements the Rules of their Club with many other Arti∣cles infinitely curious and enter∣taining  Jack Solecism  says he is a Fellow of very excellent Abi∣lities but very rarely sober enough to employ them properly or to adopt his own Words is  Allow∣edly Clever preposterously so  but  Now and then a little Drunk to be sure  He is not at present a Member of the Terrier Society but has a very fair Prospect of being speedily admitted as he ex∣cels particularly in the Indian War Whoop and is allowed by several SeaCaptains who are good Judges to approach nearer the true Sound  than any European they had ever conversed with  I hope continued he that you find yourself pleased with the Com∣pany of these good Folks as the greater Part infallibly design doing themselves the Honour of Supping with me and it is an absolute Impos∣sibility to put them off or prevent them So you see what you are to expect In reply to this I could only say that it was the very Thing which I was most desirous of provided that he could insure my Carcase from all practical Wit and manual Pleasantry which I acknowledged myself too stupid to enter into the Spirit of and consequently to have any particular Taste for This he undertook to answer for provided I on the other Hand would do my  Part by retiring in Case of parti∣cular and extraordinary Combus∣tion to which Article I with equal readiness assented So Matters be∣ing stipulated between us we stretched ourselves upon a Sopha and with the Assistance of Sleep and ChitChat murdered our Interval of Time very handsomely and by and by after having enjoyed I be∣lieve about an Hour's respite our Friends the Terriers returned with  Jack Solecism  the first Fiddle as usual As he was still very tolera∣bly drunk and the Fumes of the Liquor remained in absolute Posses∣sion of his Capital we had hardly eaten three Mouthfulls I forgot to tell you we were at Supper when he was upon his Legs declaiming with all the Energy of Diction and  before we had well finished our Meal entered with an Oration so gloriously absurd and ridiculous that I could not help committing it to Paper as soon as I quitted them and now send it to you with abso∣lute Injunctions to be diverted as you value my Friendship or regard the Trouble I shall be subjected to both in transcribing that and relat∣ing the Consequences which at∣tended it  Gentlemen said he and as he spoke he hiccup'd and drank two Bumpers of Punch to assist his Arti∣culation I think Gentlemen when I had last the Happiness of Address∣ing you in this House when as I remember you did me the Honour of increasing and enforcing my Comparisons by absolute Contact  with the Fender the Marks where∣of my Forehead retains with a grateful Sense of their Utility unto this Hour I think I say I was then giving it as my Opinion that this College was a damn'd Place that is in other Words for I mean not to swear absolutely a Place to be condemned utterly and now my present Purpose is to make good my Assertions by a little incontro∣vertible Ratiocination  Now the seniors or graduate Members of a College may I think be divided into three Species or Classes The first and best and who as being best should conse∣quently be first mentioned had they no other Pretensions to Priority are those few fine old Fellows who being naturally and originally the  Children of Dulness have chose to enjoy their Birthright unimpaired uninterrupted uncontaminated by Science and in consequence have vegetated in the Spot Providence first planted them without imper∣tinent Interference or Prying into the Conduct and Behaviour of their Betters Peace be to all such Men To their great Grizzle Wigs and Apathy I bow with Reverence The Honorable Gentlemen may call them stupid I adore them for their Stupidity 'Tis perhaps a pleasant it is certainly an innocent Amusement It offends nobody Were they as stupid as many of them are corpulent which I allow cannot easily be the Case as stupid as a Sot before Dinner or an Al∣derman after it I pay them the  greater Reverence therefore But perhaps the Honorable Gentlemen may object to their Corpulence To their globose Rotundity of Paunch I would ask the Honor∣able Gentlemen whether they are the Contractors for Victualling it Do they provide Covering for its Convexity Is not the Owner at the sole Expence of continuing it in its usual State of Dilation Is not he at the sole Expence of cover∣ing its Nakedness which unless covered would doubtless be unseem∣ly with an extravagant Profusion of Broadcloth Is not that Broadcloth black too A Colour if indeed Black may be considered as a Colour which however my Philoso∣phy has not yet determined upon notoriously Expensive from the Rot∣tenness  of its Die At least was it not Black originally tho' now per∣haps its Tint may be more venera∣bly assimilated to the verd antique Marble of  Italy  But enough of these Gentlemen let us now turn our Attention to my second Species of Existences To a Set of Men originally endued with Abilities with Abilities destroyed and obnu∣bilated by Residence and Applica∣tion Does any one start at my Assertion The Honorable Gen∣tlemen are not to be taught I hope that Application is the Bane and Destruction of Abilities The hu∣man Mind Gentlemen pardon the Comparison is like a Leg of Mut∣ton The Meat is fine but re∣quires Roasting to make it eatable We place it before the Fire then  and it is suffer'd according to its Size to continue there for a longer or shorter Period We resume it and upon cutting it we find the natural Gravy remains there but matured and meliorated by Con∣coction So far it has been in a State of Improvement It is then at its Point Tropical its Solstice its Zenith of Perfection But would any Cook in Christendom replace it there in Expectation of farther Advantages Would she not know that any farther Torrefaction must be prejudicial That the natural Gravy would from that Time de∣crease and evaporate gradually A Gravy Gentlemen not to be supplied by all the adscititious Sauces of the most ingenious Arti∣ficer I presume no Gentleman  needs my Information that Learn∣ing is an elegant Accomplishment So is Snufftaking That the one strengthens the Ideas and clears the Head of its Votary So does the other But in either Case how dangerous are Excesses In the one it degenerates into Pedantry In the other to Bestiality and Nastiness I will conclude my Remarks on this Species with their Character as drawn by a late elegant Satyrist  Fellows who've soak'd away their Knowledge  In sleepy Residence at College  Whose Lives are like a stagnant Pool  Muddy and placid dull and cool  Mere drinking eating eating drinking  With no Impertinence of Thinking  Who lack no farther Erudition  Than just to set an Imposition  To cramp demolish and dispirit  Each truebegotten Child of Merit  Censors who in the Day's broad Light  Punish the Vice they act at Night  Whose Charity with self begins  Nor covers others venial Sins  But that their Feet may safely tread  Take up Hypocrisy instead  As knowing that must always hide  A Multitude of Sins beside  Whose rusty Wit is at a stand  Without a Freshman at their Hand  I am come now Gentlemen to my Third Division And here willingly would I be silent but Justice calls upon me to speak though my Feelings are wounded by the Description What shall I say then Shall I call them with Dr  Hurd  in one of his Dialogues a Set of "Bearded Boys"  And would you invite our liberal and noble Youth to resort hither Can you expect that their free Spirits will stoop to be lectured by these Or that their Minds  can ever be formed and tutored by such Pedants in a Way that fits them for the real Practice of the World and of Mankind  But let us chuse an Instance for Illustration Let one suffer for the Rest and be selected as a Subject for Dissection And can we want a Sub∣ject whilst  Euclid  is before us A Fellow whose only Pleasure and De∣light lies in plaguing every body of equal Genius but less Erudition than himself A Fellow whose very Instructions are Insults who forces Science upon you  Nolens volens  as an Apothecary does Physic thrusts Rhomboids Parallelograms and Parallelopipedons down your Throat like  Pistol  's Leek crams you with Pentagons Hexagons and Quindekagons till your Head is  as full of odd Shapes and Figures as a Chinese Manuscript or an Egyptian Necromancer's Talisman or the Hieroglyphics of a greasy Buttery Account Book A Fellow who claps a triangular Mathema∣tical Yoke or Collar round your Neck as they do round a Hog's to prevent your getting thro' the Parallels of a fivebarr'd Gate and feasting in the Turnip Field of Classical Knowledge on the other Side of it  Evil Communication says the old Copybook corrupts good Man∣ners and for my Part I declare honestly that I can hardly consider that Knowledge as respectable which I behold prostituted and contaminated by a Communication with the most despicable of Cha∣racters  I can't help connecting my Ideas of one with the other and then damn 'em I hate both And yet get them by themselves the Mathematics are good intelli∣gent Things enough And very useful too for a Land Surveyor or Builder of Bridges I'm sure I look up to them with Fear and Reverence as a Thief does to a Gibbet and only pray secretly that it may never be my Case  And then he is such an inveterate unchristian Rascal in his Resent∣ments  Letting the Sun go down upon his Wrath  An absolute  Polypheme  Nec visu Facilis nec Dictu Affabilis ulli  In short ten Times worse than  Pedant  or any of his Compeers in as much at least as a Person who behaves Ill  to every body is worse than him who has no Behaviour at all And yet they are all bad enough occasion∣ally even men who are liberal and well spoken of at any other Place as if they thought Illiberality a College Accomplishment and were afraid of appearing affected and singular if they did not give into it Or perhaps it may be Philo∣sophically accounted for by the Difference of the Medium in these Parts and that the very Atmosphere is mephitically im∣pregnated with a Sort of illiberal Vapour from the constant Res∣piration of such a Number of uncivilized Inhabitants  By the Time our  Cicero  had got thus far in his Oration which I have here endeavoured to give you  connectively omitting the frequent Remarks and Interruptions of his Companions the Quantity of Li∣quor which he had drank or ac∣cording to his own Philosophical Method of accounting for Things the Vinous Atmosphere he had been so long Breathing called off the Organs of Speech from Elocu∣tion to employ them in an Ope∣ration perhaps more natural and certainly better adapted to his pre∣sent Condition His Eyes fixed his Jaw fell down he dropt and to use the Words of an Irish Ac∣quaintance of mine when he was describing the Issue of one of his Duels  Never brought Life to the Ground with him  At least not intellectual Life Well in this State he lay for about five Minutes  formidably Nasty indeed Cascad∣ing like a Leaden RiverGod's Urn or the grotesque Human Water∣spouts of a gothic Cathedral Pre∣sently he began to kick a little and in a short Time after by the Ap∣plication of Salt hot Water and other Methods according to the Practice of the  Humane Society  which his Companions were very liberally observant of he started up at once on his Legs filled an halfpint Bumper of Punch and indis∣tinctly muttering an old Adage of his own that  the more came out the more Room to go in  drain∣ed it in an Instant This Act of Heroism with the sagacious Com∣ment that accompanied it excited a Burst of Universal Applause  "Well  Jack"  cried  Tom Riotous  who stood next him "Now you have settled your Internals I sup∣pose we shall have the Rest of your Oration Come come why damn ye you look as Meagre and as Melancholy as  Duns Scotus  of  Mer∣ton  in the last Page of the Bible Come your Oration"  "Oration Sir" exclaimed  Sole∣cism  who since his last half Pint of Lethe had been black in the Face with a Kind of hiccuping Convulsion and remained without the least Recollection of any pre∣vious Circumstances "Oration Sir what d'ye mean to Insult me Sir Oration Sir is of two Kinds  Demosthenes  and his Plumbstones Two Me∣thods of using the Hand    in Oration Sir First there is the Hand open employed in the milder Kind of Argument Then Sir damme I will not put up with an Insult there's the Hand closed commonly called the clinch'd Fist  d'ye observe me for more weighty Arguments Sir to evince convince The knockyedown Argument Sir which will hum∣ble the most highheaded Adver∣sary convert his perpendicular Arrogance into an horizontal Su∣pineness as I am now going to demonstrate upon your poor miser∣able Carcase" And as he spoke the last Word he made a Blow at  Riotous  which had it taken Place properly would most effectually have verified his Assertion by level∣ling the Object of it but through  want of Precision in the Director vented itself on an unhappy Plaister Figure of  Tully  that stood upon the Mantelpiece which it broke into a thousand Pieces  "Sir" cried  Riotous  enforcing his Exclamation with a most dig∣nified Profusion of Blasphemy which as the Wit will evaporate in Repetition I shall leave you to guess at "Do you strike me Sir Such Behaviour requires Satisfac∣tion I insist upon immediate Sa∣tisfaction" Pistols were produced instantly for it seems they are as necessary a Part of Furniture in an  Oxford  Apartment as a Corkscrew or an Horsewhip Seconds were chosen Ground measured and every thing prepared for Action In the same Moment  sans Ceremonie  or Compliment  Solecism  swore and fired but without any Effect Upon this  Riotous  advanced and applying the Muzzle of his Pistol to the Mouth of his unfortunate Antagonist who began now to re∣cover his Senses  "Solecism"  says he "you have broken the Rules of Honour And now by God Sir I'm sorry to tell you that you must die the Death for it So prepare yourself to drop like a Gentleman and here's at you Gentlemen fill Bumpers to  Solecism  's Voyage in the Ferryboat and raise a Subscription to pay for his Passage for I dare say he has not a Sixpence of his own to defray the Expences Have you  Jack"  Our poor Orator ran behind the Window Curtain and roared for Mercy As one depre∣cated  the other persisted till at last finding his Enemy inexorable he plucked up his scatter'd Resolution and being determined I suppose to die like a good Christian popp'd forth a Face the most ruefully ridi∣culous I ever beheld and begg'd but for a minute's Respite Then drawing it in again "O Lord" cried he "Thou seest the Situa∣tion I am in pity a  poor  miserable Sinner aye cried  Riotous  there you see he acknowledges his Poverty I told you he had not a Sixpence Come subscribe Gentlemen who is going to be blown out of Life in a Smoke by He was then silent for about a Minute but presently raising his Voice again Lord  Jesus  added he receive my Spirit and now Sir throw∣ing  aside the Curtain and stepping for∣ward with a calm assured Counte∣nance now Damn ye Fire away" 'Twas done as soon as spoke a Cloud of Smoke darken'd the Apartment and upon its dispersing no  Solecism  was to be found One would have imagined him carried off by some Inchanter like an  Arabian Night  Princess or abso∣lutely pulverized to an impalpable Powder by the Horrors of his Situ∣ation Well for above half an Hour I believe did we hunt after him in every Staircase in the Qua∣drangle Dogs and all till at last guided by a Degree of Scent which I verily believe led us to the Disco∣very we found him squeezed be∣hind the Door of a Cellar with his Eyes and Tongue rolling like  the Clockwork Drummer at the Waxwork and his Hands raised upwards like the Effigies of some brazen Saint in the Aisle or Vesti∣bule of a Cathedral And here unobserved by the Rest of the Com∣pany I took my Leave of  Frankley  and departed to my Inn And so ended the Operations of the first Day  And now  Charles  I may tell you lest you should suspect me of In∣chantment in good earnest that the Seconds had put no Lead into the Pistols which allowed  Solecism  the Capability of quitting the Room at the Instant  Riotous  fired  How  he effected it you must enquire of his Fears as it was with a more instantaneous Velocity than I have any Conception of  The next Morning old  Hartley  informed me that he had been suc∣cessful in his second Attack upon  Pedant  and that we were both en∣gaged to Breakfast there On our Arrival we found him seated in due Form and Order surrounded by Food mental and corporeal with a Companion on the other Side the Table whose Countenance had I met with it in a dark Lane or Alley would by no means have corres∣ponded with my Ideas of personal Safety Upon our Entrance they rose and bowed distantly and im∣mediately reseating themselves we followed their Example and took our Chairs in awful Silence As  Pedant  had not thought it necessary to effect a nominal Acquaintance of Parties by introducing us to this  Friend of his we could only en∣deavour to supply the Deficiency by surveying each other with that Kind of cautious Curiosity which you may have seen in two Dogs upon their first Meeting when they look half afraid and in Doubt whe∣ther they shall quarrel or not  Hartley  indeed soon struck up a Conversation with  Pedant  which I joined in occasionally but my Attention was chiefly occupied in forming a conjectural Judgment of his Comrade whose Lips were never opened unless once in five Minutes to give an abrupt Negative to what somebody else had been saying "No such ThingIt was not so"or "I don't believe a Word of it" and then he would take up a Book and begin Reading  again Faith  Charles  I believe  Pedant  never appeared to such Ad∣vantage before I began to suspect that he was determined to make the best of himself and so brought the other Animal by way of Foil For though neither of them could be accused of being overburthen'd with  Entregent  or Politeness yet the Reserve and Aukwardness which proceeded from  Mauvaise Honte  in  Pedant  seemed in the other to arise from a churlish Selfconceit and a predetermined Contempt for the Understanding of his Company Good God thought I this must be poor  Solecism  's Friend  Euclid  there cannot surely exist two such Wretches And  Euclid  indeed it was as I found presently after by  Pedant  's naming him in the Course  of Conversation I dare say now  Charles  from the little I saw of the Man that he is capable of going into the first Company com∣mitting every Incivility perpetrat∣ing every shocking Clumsiness he can think of and in short just doing every thing that he ought not to do without imagining it necessary to be ashamed of himself I fancy he is one of those  Ipse Dixit  infallible Gentlemen who either think they cannot do wrong or imagine themselves qualified to do it But I'll not attempt his Cha∣racter as I can send it to you drawn in a much more masterly Manner by somebody who knows him bet∣ter than I ever desire to do It was given me by  Frankley  whom I happened to meet in the Evening  at the Coffeehouse and upon mentioning the Company I had breakfasted with he took it out of his Pocket and told me that it was found about three or four Mornings since pasted upon the Door of  Euclid  's Chambers by way of Epitaph but that the Au∣thor was utterly unknown  EPITAPH  Here continueth to slumber  Whilst his Mind absorpt in Science  Dreams wildly of imaginary Propositions  The Body of DIAGRAM EUCLID  A Man who in Defiance of the Weaknesses  Unavoidably incident to his Nature  Preserved a Consistency of Conduct  And supported an Uniformity of Character  Which Malice never could Asperse  And Slander was unable to Vilify  As a Tutor and Governor of his College  Towards his Inferiors his Superiors and his Equals  Towards his Servants his Pupils and towards his Friends  If indeed he ever possessed one  He persevered in an unvaried Illiberality of Be∣haviour  That he might avoid the very Suspicion of being Partial  Politeness he considered as a Servility  Disgraceful to the Dignity of Learning  And as his Soul was incapable of the Comforts of Society  His Actions honestly expressed his dislike to it  By disgusting every Company he appeared in  With the Superciliousness of Cynical Contempt  That he might not be accidentally agreeable  He observed from his first Entrance at the Uni∣versity  An inflexible Moroseness of Countenance  Which characterized the Misanthrophy of his Heart  Nor was he ever seen to relax the Scowl of Severity  But when his Spleen and Illnature were gratified  In wounding the Feelings of the Ingenuous  Or covering the Face of the Diffident with the Blush of Confusion  To avoid being imposed upon by Appearances  His  Memory  never  forgot  an Affront  And his  Heart  was never weak enough to  forgive  one  For he considered Forgiveness as a Credulity  Which might expose him to the Repetition of Insult  When he was appointed Lecturer of his College  In his favourite Science of Mathematics  He confused the Understanding of his Auditors  By Expressions they were incapable of compre∣hending  And by a vain Ostentation of his own Erudition  Obscured what it was his Business to have illus∣trated to others  In his Opinions and Assertions he was dogmatical  Proud pedantic and perplexing  Nor did he ever scruple to reprobate  With all the Arrogance of conscious Superiority  The united Authorities of his Predecessors in Science  When they chanced to differ in their Sentiments  From his own infallible Standard of Perfection  Think not youthful Reader  From the Depravity of this Man's Character  That the Pursuit of Learning is to be neglected  He was but suffered as an Instance  That without  good Manners  it may be  Despised  Without  good Nature  it must ever be  Detested  Well  Charles  what think you of it Is it not a pretty good Pas∣quinade God help the poor Au∣thor if he should be discovered for I don't believe the Golgotha would have much mercy on him  To return to my Breakfast again which I hope you have not forgot was suspended from a Principle of pure digressive Politeness I must inform you that  Euclid  having left us as soon as it was finished old  Hartley  and  Pedant  sat down to an inveterate Tête á Tête together and having in the Course of about two Hours restored  Helen  to her Husband routed the  Persian  Army at the Plains of  Marathon  with divers other Atchievements equally difficult and celebrated it was pro∣posed formally on  Hartley's  Part and after due Hesitation as for∣mally consented to on  Pedant's  that he should accompany us to  Dorsetshire  And so here we are all at present living as comfortably as we can together Old  Hartley  and  Pedant  and  Pedant  and old  Hartley  to the End of the Chapter And then  Kitty  and  I  and  I  and  Kitty  in∣seperables Sometimes strolling in the Garden and admiring the  horizontal Verdure of her Father's clipt Hedges with fifty pretty little Similars full as indolently en∣tertaining Farewell  Melmoth  The Voice of my Charmer who at this Instant enters the Room cuts short my Tale and obliges me to con∣clude incontinently  W Easy  "From her Virgin Cheek a fresher Bloom  "Shoots less and less the live Carnation round  "Her Lips blush deeper Sweets she breaths of "Youth  "The shining Moisture swells into her Eyes  "In brighter flow her wishing Bosom heaves  "With Palpitations wild kind Tumults seize  "Her Veins and all her yielding Soul is Love"  Miss  RUGG  to Miss  HARTLEY  Foxhall  August  My Dear Kitty  I Received yours Upon my Honour you have treated my last Letter very unmercifully and po∣sitively accused me of Slyness and Secresy without considering the Confidence I placed in you by sending it at all Suppose I had thought proper to burn it and had given you a fair Copy revised and corrected And then after hav∣ing been as spiteful and malicious as you possibly could be and torn the poor thing Peicemeal Sen∣tence by Sentence you affect to  be wondrously merciful and 'tis your Charity forsooth that obliges you to believe that I did it all on Purpose Since you are so very ready at Belief and Supposition I shall not tell you whether I did or not perhaps I might But you know I can't retort or rally you which makes you so saucy How∣ever  I must in Charity believe that you did it all  by Accident  or I shall never have any Mercy on you  and as you have made some amends by sending me  Easy  's Poetical Secrets I will even go farther and give you a little authentic Information as to my Prospects with  Melmoth  And this I can do in a very few Sentences merely by way of Con∣tinuation to  Easy  's Intelligence Since his Departure from  Foxhall  then my Uncle has been applied to by Letter in consequence of which he arrived here about three Days ago He has given his Con∣sent and Approbation to our Mar∣riage  Melmoth  has determined to quit the Army and every thing will probably be concluded in the Course of this Month We expect my two Aunts from  York  on  Wed∣nesday  Is this Account plain and undisguised enough Or is there any sly Stile of Secresy to be com∣plained of As to expatiating upon my own Happiness and my Inamo∣rato's Extacy I shall leave your Sensations when you think of simi∣lar Prospects with  Easy  to supply the Omission You know I love him I own honestly that I do and I hope at least that he loves  me equally What can I say then but what your own Feelings will more forcibly speak for me Adieu  Kitty  write soon to me and be∣lieve my Sincerity when I wish to see you as Happy as she hopes to be who now probably for the last Time subscribes herself  Maria Rugg  Mr  HARTLEY  to Sir  ANTHONY ARTICHOKE  O Sir  Anthony  Sir  Anthony  My best Set of Plans and Schemes the best I ever contrived in my Life are all blown up and gone and come to nothing as one may say Here when I had got him into  Dorsetshire  and talked him over and persuaded him and had just brought Matters to bear and had got him into the right Humour for it and he had given his Consent to marry my Daughter and all was in a Manner settled except acquainting her with my Success then what does she go and do but runs away within two Hours after I told her of her Happiness and  takes  Easy  with her too and I sup∣pose they are gone to be married together O Never never was such an unlucky old Man in this World as I am And after you warned me so much against it too in your last Letter and told me you thought my Daughter had a Mind for a Husband that I did not in tend for her And truly I began latterly to suspect as much myself but then who would have thought of her going off and running away in this sudden Manner as one may call it or else I had prepared to counteract that Husband for her O I am the most unfortunate old Man in the World surely  "Dicique Beatus  "Aute obitum Nemo supremaque Funera debet"  Here I went to her after Breakfast this Morning and told her that next  Monday  was to be the happy Day and how happy I should be and the like and she put me into a Passion and when I came to en∣quire for her at Dinner Time no∣body could tell what was become of her and  Easy  was missing like∣wise So I was for going to the Inn and making Enquiries and following them immediately in the Heat of my Passion but Mr  Pedant  was luckily at Hand to prevent me and persuaded me that by staying till the next Morning we could send and investigate Matters at the Inn more minutely and should have more Time to consider what Steps should be taken and to pack up our Things and to prepare  every thing for pursuing them So here I am quite out of my Wits about it as I may say and my old Butler that has lived with me these four and twenty Years come  Mi∣chaelmas  is quite out of his Wits too and can hardly believe it and is gone to the  Fox  and  Goose  and the  CrookedBillet  with  John Dock∣tail  the Coachman to see if he can hear any Tidings of her and I told him to go to every Place in the Neighbourhood and to get a Man to cry her An obstinate perverse Hussy I'm sure she has no more Taste for the dead Lan∣guages than my Housemaid or she would never have ran away from such a Husband as Mr  Pedant  If she had but known how well the Ancients understood them and  could discourse in them And so often as I have talked to her about them but she never would listen to me And there I hear poor Mr  Pedant  now shut up in his Room reading Greek like one distracted Poor Man I believe he never would express himself in his native Language if he could help it But I am in the utmost Hurry and Confusion and must go and give Orders about fifty Things immediately which obliges me to conclude as that wise People the  Spartans  used to do upon urgent Occasions In great Haste  Yours Laconically  Christopher Hartley  Miss  HARTLEY  to Miss  RUGG  My dear Rugg  HOW shall I write to you and what Kind of round∣about Expression shall I adopt to acquaint you with my Situation The more I consider the more I feel myself at a Loss In three Words then be it known that my Fa∣ther has been opinionated and im∣perious I have been perhaps a little inconsiderate and am at pre∣sent almost before I know how to believe it on the Road to  Scotland  with  Easy  And now if you have had Time enough for your Wonderment and  Conjecture I'll let you into Parti∣culars You know my poor Papa amongst his other Qualifications had always that wise one of mak∣ing every thing a great Secret and keeping People as much in the Dark as possible whenever he had a Scheme in his Head by way of surprizing them all at once with its Excellence when the Wind did get to it So last  Thursday  after Breakfast he came up to my Room a Thing not very common with him and which indeed he seldom used but upon grand Occasions and seating himself in a great Chair and settling his Wig with both Hands by way of Preparation  "Kitty"  says he with a Face that told me some wondrous Matter was in Agitation  you remember  when I was in  London  that I in∣troduced my Friend Mr  Pedant  to you as a Man every Way qua∣lified to make you a good Hus∣band and to restrain that Levity and Giddiness which the younger Part of your Sex are too much guilty of though I must own I rather despaired of ever bringing him to consent to the Match He has now you know been here above a Month with me in the Country in which Time by Persuasions and Promises I have at last with Difficulty prevailed upon him to accept of my Pro∣posals and therefore lest upon Reconsideration he should be in∣duced to alter his Mind towards you in this Matter I have thought it better to Strike whilst the  Iron is hot and on  Monday  next have resolved that you shall be made happy In Regard to    My Dear  Rugg  I was Thunder∣struck for tho' I knew this was my Father's Intention in bringing  Pedant  to  Dorsetshire  with him yet I had no Idea that the ungain Animal would ever have consented to so dreadful a Ceremony with me after the many silly Looks I had helped him to put on since he had been there However I presently collected myself enough to cut my Father short in the Middle of his Sentence which I suppose was to have concluded with a Panegyric on his Bookworm by a  God forbid my Dear Sir that ever the Living and the Dead should be joined together Let the Dead  bury their Dead my Dear Father and his Books him say I for I'm sure he is as disagreeable and dead to the World as the Lan∣guages he cultivates  My Father looked at me wond∣rous petulant I could perceive O those confounded Languages that ever my ill Stars led me to men∣tion the Word for immediately and the Frenzy took him like Lightning "Peace Peace Girl" said he  the Greek Language though it  And here he was tumbling all at once into his Eulo∣gium upon its various Excellencies when I who had experienced the miserable  Ennui  of that self same Dissertation at least fifty Times in my Life and knew from the Be∣ginning that it might last from two  Hours to three or four could not help interrupting him by saying how much I was indebted for the Trouble he was going to give him∣self but as I had it perfectly fresh in my Memory since the Rehearsal of  Tuesday  Se'nnight I should be happy to postpone the Hearing till some future Opportunity when my Recollection might begin to fail me This put him into a desperate Passion which I really did not Design He snatch'd up his Stick to express the Vehemence of his Displeasure but Impatience begetting Inatten∣tion instead of the Floor which he intended should be the Sufferer he applied it to his own Gouty Shins with such a hearty Goodwill that I thought he would never have forgiven himself He was now  past all Patience so that grinning between his high Anger for my contemptuous Treatment of the  Grecians  and the actual Pain he suffered from the Vigour of his own Bastinado "By God" cried he  Kitty  I'll not be trifled with  Monday  is the Day on which your Happiness is determined and Happy you shall be rubbing his Leg all the Time in spite of yourself I know more of  Easy  Madam than you are aware of  And with these Words he hobbled out of the Room  What could I do my Dear I knew him to be exceeding obstinate particularly when Literature was in the Question besides I was ra∣ther piqued at the Positiveness and  Undutifulness of his Behaviour for I hold Undutifulness in a Pa∣rent to be the worst of all possible Offences And then too his last obscure Sentence in regard to  Easy  greatly perplexed me Just as I was in the Midst of all these Puzzles  Easy  came into the Room and discovering immediately by my Countenance that all was not Right enquired what was the Matter I as People in a Passion like Inva∣lids are always bursting to tell their Complaints related all that had happened and to cut my Story short what with Persuasion and Argument on one Side and Fear and Displeasure and an odd Taste for Novelty and Eclat on the other recollecting too that very just Saying of the Poet that  The  Woman who deliberates is lost  which  Easy  very forcibly urged upon me he made the best of his Opportunity and within two Hours I found myself in a Postchaise half willing half unwilling no∣thing with me but my RidingHabit and some Linen and indeed not quite certain whether I was there myself  So you see my Dear how great Consequences like great Folks generally owe their Greatness to small Causes and little Incidents▪ for had not that unfortunate Disser∣tation upon the Grecians come across us and had not my Father when he catched up his Stick in consequence of my thwarting him there made that unpropitious Ap∣plication to his own Shins instead  of the Ground which he intended we might probably have talked the Matter over coolly the Day of Marriage might have been post∣poned  Pedant  after several Pro∣tractions might in the End have been exploded or tired out and every Thing terminated as I could have wished for Whereas now my Father I dare say is raving like fifty Bedlamites and perhaps spout∣ing Greek too at such a Rate that all the Country will take him for a Necromancer whilst I like a poor inconsiderate giddybrain'd Girl am flourishing away and killing Posthorses with a Knight Errant on a Journey to the Land of Matri∣mony without so much as a new Gown or a Weddingring prepared for the Occasion  Well my Dear  Maria  of all the silly Things you feel yourself disposed to never make a Runaway Match of it Though I don't think you are in any great Danger with all your Reserve and Prudence about matrimonial Matters And yet how should I laugh to see you for once as great a Madcap as my∣self To meet you upon the Road now  going off  as they say with your Officer Some how or other I am monstrously frightened I did not think I should have been half such a Coward when I sat out or I'm sure he would never have per∣suaded me However I long anxi∣ously for your Opinion about it Do you think I have acted Rightly If yes let me know instantly But if no you may as well keep your  Pen and Censure to yourself for since what is done is done I am determined to be in the Right so I tell you beforehand And yet you can't write to me for I have no Place of Address and now only steal this Hour from Sleep to scrib∣ble to you as we are off again very early in the Morning However we purpose seeing you at  Foxhall  on our Return when we shall not be in such a desperate Hurry as we are at present Adieu and believe me whether single or married  Yours ever  Catharine Hartley  P S I received your last How different the Stile of our two Wed∣dings will be As different as our Dispositions  WILLIAM EASY  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Edinburgh  My Dear Charles  TO say that I am the happiest Creature existing will be only repeating what every vulgar Fool or Merchant's Clerk has said upon the same Occasion and yet how else can I express myself Miss  Hartley  Miss  Hartley  now no more is mine by all the Ties of Love and Honour Don't think me mad and raving now and throw down my Letter in a Passion We were married Yesterday The Place my Letter is dated from will give  you some Information as to the grand Outline of our Proceedings the Particulars I am now going to furnish you with  I believe I mentioned in my last that I was not entirely satisfied with some Parts of  Pedant  's Behaviour nor with the frequent Closetings and Conferences between him and old  Hartley  I cannot say that I paid any Attention to those Appearances at the Time but since they have turned out so consequential I must men∣tion one particular Circumstance as it occurs to me before I proceed any farther About a Fortnight ago I remember when old  Hartley  had retired as usual to take his Afternoon Nap and  Pedant  and myself were left in the Parlour to∣gether I stept out of the Room  for about ten Minutes to relieve myself from the Fatigue of his Taciturnity by a little Conversation with my  Kitty  above Stairs Upon my Return finding the Wretch exactly where I left him absorpt in Cogitation I was in some doubt at first whether I ought not to at∣tempt a Recovery from the Torpor he seemed to labour under by a salutary Tweak of the Nose when presently I observed the Forefinger of his Righthand placed cautiously and as if it was an Act of Delibe∣ration across the Palm of his Left and after a few unintelligible Mut∣terings he began Syllogizing as follows  The Man who marries Miss  Hartley  gets her Fortune  I marry Miss  Hartley  Ergo I get her Fortune  I could hold out no longer but instantly gave him the  Negatur  with a Voice that made him start as if he had seen the Ghosts of his Forefathers for he had not per∣ceived that I was in the Room He jump'd up and  Roll'd his Eyes that witnessed Huge Dis∣may  and turned out of the Room with a more meaning Con∣fusion in his Countenance than I ever before observed there Now this little Circumstance I say knowing the Man's Stile and Cha∣racter as well as several others had made me for some Time sus∣pect that the old Gentleman and  Pedant  had some silly Piece of Con∣trivance in their Head However as nothing very Material appeared I doubted not but that with the  Help of my Dear Divinity I should be able gradually to Counteract them before they brought any Thing to a Conclusion The Event however proved the Contrary and as the Suddenness of their Explo∣sion left me no Opportunity for Sap or Countermine in my Opera∣tions I was oblige to commit every Thing to the Hazard of a  Coup de Main  in which I happily succeeded Going a few Mornings since I be∣lieve it was  Thursday  into  Kitty's  Dressingroom "O  Easy"  says she and I thought she seemed net∣tled at something "I'm glad you are come to give me Joy  Monday  next is the Day fixed on for my being made happy that is you know in my Father's Dialect being mar∣ried to  Pedant" "Monday  next"  was my Reply "And more than that" continued she "He is so Paternal as to tell me that I  shall  be made happy then whether I like it or not If he thinks he can effect this I fancy he will be about as cunning as  Sancho  in his Govern∣ment when he sentenced a Crimi∣nal to  sleep  so many Nights in Prison But what is to be done  Easy  What Measures can we take to prevent all this For you know if one did feel an odd Fancy to accept of the Wretch one would chuse to take one's own Time about it" Was not this a fair Opening  Charles  Little Cupid who I suppose sat upon my Shoulder im∣mediately whisper'd  "Scotland  and a Postchaise and Four" and offer∣ed himself as first Postillion Faith  I thought the young Fellow advised very sensibly so as he had men∣tioned it in Confidence to me I could not do otherwise than com∣municate it between a Kiss and a Whisper to the Ear of my  Kitty  She look'd a little Queerly at the Proposal and hesitated and said nothing When a Woman does not absolutely start at the first In∣timation of a Thing of this Na∣ture you may make yourself sure of her Consenting within half an Hour if it is not your own Fault So having once broke the Ice I thought it better like old  Hartley  to "Strike whilst the Iron is hot" and urged my Proposal upon her with all the Rhetoric I was master of I exaggerated the inevitable Danger she exposed herself to by  delaying any longer expatiated upon the unhappy Obstinacy of her Father's Temper that as he had hitherto kept his Designs so secret as to the Time intended for her Marriage it was too probable that excited by his detestable Coad∣jutor he would adopt Measures for the effecting it which must ut∣terly Ruin all our Prospects That it was not to be doubted but that her Father though he might at first be highly displeased with the Step I proposed would soon upon Consideration see Things in a pro∣per Light and even be inclined to thank us for Counteracting him That all his Friends she very well knew had invariably condemned his strange Idea of sacrificing his Daughter to a Bookworm That  their Opinions would certainly have great Weight with him when the Delusion he at present laboured under was removed That as she knew how well he loved her his Displeasure would fall in some Part upon  Pedant  mutual Recri∣minations would ensue and the Animal would show himself in his proper Colours That at all Events her Father's strange Treat∣ment of her in this Business would entirely justify her Measures and that I could not say however highly I reverenced the Duty of Children towards their Parents that I thought it should be observed implicitly when so great a Stake as one's own Happiness or Misery was depend∣ing" Whilst I was haranguing thus finely I could perceive by five  hundred little Changes in her Countenance what an internal Contest she was engaged in For Instance there was Love I suppose and the Novelty of the Thing and a little Pique against her Fa∣ther all Volunteers on my Side the Question Then there was Prudence and Propriety and Punc∣tilio and a whole Musterroll of Presbyterian Virtues like a City Militia on the other And like a City Militia there they stood by each other all in Form no doubt and made a great Show of Resist∣ance but as soon as the other Party charged home upon them away they ran as if the Devil was at their Heels and not two were to be found together 'till all the Dan∣ger was over For guessing how  Matters stood with her I brought up to the Attack a Reinforcement of Arguments and at last as the Reward for all my Trouble drew from her Lips a dear Kind of half denying Affirmative which I took immediate Advantage of by run∣ning out of the Room whilst she remained in the right Humour and in short conducted every thing with so much Vigour that I be∣lieve within two Hours from the Time of our Consultation we found ourselves Cheek by Jole in a Postchaise together  And here we are now in  Scotland  as happy as any two new married People can be My dear Girl with all "the Bloom of young Desire and purple light of Love" glowing in her Cheeks is more winning  Soft more amiably Mild than all the Heathen Beauties I ever heard or read of if they were put toge∣ther with their Goddesses at the Head of them O  Charles  How she looked Yesterday as we returned from the Altar With such a dear  Demisaison April  Smile upon her Countenance moistened with a Tear And every now and then she is so prettily Pensive which I love her ten Times more for from the Novelty of the Thing O  Melmoth  how rejoiced I am on all Accounts at what has happened For if her Father had been less Precipitate and Peremptory and I had not taken her at the Instant when every Thing was favourable the little Gipsy might have played me on and off for this Twelvemonth  and teazed my very Soul out By the Bye I wonder why that odd Ur∣chin  Cupid  pitches upon  Scotland  as the Place of Rendezvous for all his mad Votaries unless he does it to caseharden their Hearts against all other Impressions by the Rigour of the Climate like hot Iron in cold Water Or perhaps he means to try whether their Passion will bear Change of Country and considers no Love as a true one which is not sufficient to keep a Man warm so many Degrees Northward and enable him to write Odes like a  Laplander  to his  Orra Moor  tho' he is Knee deep in Snow all the Time  Well  Charles  I think I have done very handsomely in absenting myself so long from my  Gentle  Kate  on purpose to send an Account of Matters to you And if you don't think so to though I believe you are still uxorious enough to allow my Plea pray put your∣self in my Situation for five Mi∣nutes and then if you are not amazed at my Abstinence I shall not scruple to call you the most unreasonable Fellow living when∣ever I meet you Adieu we are now going to station ourselves at Sir  Thorobred  's from whence Pe∣nitentials Mediatorials and Conci∣liatories will be dispatched to my queer Fatherinlaw with all due Ceremony and Expedition  Encore  Adieu Believe me tho' married as much as ever your  William Easy  Sir  THOROBRED RUGG  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq  Foxhall  DAmnation  Charles Melmoth  I believe every body is mad of our Acquaintance at least and are determined to make my House their Bedlam Here's your Brother  George  and  Maria  in the first Place they have been prating and preach∣ing and palavering one another over till they have both persuaded them∣selves they were in Love and so then my Uncle was to be wrote to and fetched to see their Folly and consent to  their  Running in Cou∣ples  By and by I hear a confounded Noise and Rattle at my Gate and who of all the Fools in the World should bolt out of a Postchaise but our poor silly Friend  Easy  with  Kitty Hartley  tack'd to his Tail by Way of Helpmate However they have had a long Run for it and good Sport I dare swear Let me see A damn'd silly Scheme of old  Hartley  's about one  Pedant  first unkennell'd them 'Twas at his House they broke cover And then took off strait an End to  Edin∣burgh  The old Fellow and  Pe∣dant  after them full cry A fine Burst by God Well at  Edin∣burgh  they headed back it seems and before old  Hartley  got there were both earth'd safe enough at  Foxhall  However the old Dog  stuck to the Scent and was here yesterday Morning by ten o'Clock to dig 'em out again As for  Pe∣dant  he lagg'd and was lost some how as soon as he lost Scent of Matrimony However I'm glad to see  Easy  has so much Bottom I never thought he'd have run half so well And the old Buck is in good Humour too now he finds Things can't be altered  So I have got a fine Housefull of 'em too and not a Creature ex∣cept your Brother knows which Side of a Horse to mount on like that poor stupid Rascal  Nineveh  that didn't know his Righthand from his left as King  Solomon  says I wish you and your Wife were here with all my Soul for the Lovers talk all of them so much  like Fools and  Hartley  so much like an old Schoolmaster that there's no bearing them and my Uncle you know is a devilish Slugg in Conversation at best So that at present I'm absolutely not Master of my own House and can hardly squeeze in a Word edgeways about  Surly  or my Chesnut Stonehorse Faith I begin to find it very true what my old Friend  Virgil  used to tell me when I was at School in his Art of Prophecy that it was impossible to couple a Horse's Neck to a Man's Head I believe he said People would laugh at you if you tried at it  Humano Capiti Risum tencatis Equinum  You remember what I mean And indeed he was pretty right there too for they generally do when I  begin and  Will Easy  in particular who knows no more of a Horse than I do of a Rhinoceros Poor ignorant Fellow And  George  too though he sometimes will ride with me yet he always pulls his Boots off and Dresses when he comes in and scents himself with all Manner of Nastiness for my Sister to smell to him He never goes by my Kennel but the Dogs give tongue and when he came down here was mistaken at two or three Inns for  Bailey  the great Perfumer in  Cock∣spurStreet  So I'm always obliged to carry a Fox's Pad in my Pocket to prevent being infected Love Love Love and Ottah of Roses from Morning till Night Damn it I'll go and coquet with my Horse

Sir  Thorobred  's two Aunts whom I had almost forgot to men∣tion A Couple of old Snuff∣boxes or Rolls of Pigtail To∣bacco  SCENE  Foxhall  Servants Horses Victuals and Drink Licences Settlements c  ACT st SCENE st  And here if you please we will drop our Theatrical Embellish∣ments  and give you a plain Histo∣rical Account of Things I men∣tioned in my last our Intention of stopping at Sir  Thorobred  's and dispatching our Penitentials from that Quarter But the old Gen∣tleman has saved us the Trouble For we had hardly been stationed here four and twenty Hours just Time enough to tell our Adven∣tures eat a comfortable Meal and enjoy a good Night's sleep upon it when the next Morning about half an Hour after Breakfast as I was sauntering in the Hall with the Baronet I heard a Carriage stop at the Gate and presently in stump'd old  Hartley  with his two Ivoryheaded Canes in one Hand and his Hat and Handkerchief in  the other You may guess I found myself in a little  Embarras  at his appearing so unexpectedly Sir  Thorobred  advanced to receive him  He begg'd Pardon he said for troubling him with this Visit but that it was needless to men∣tion the Occasion of it and that he should be glad of a little private Conversation with me  So in he went to Sir  Thorobred  's Study and I followed with as little Inclination as ever I did at  Eton  to receive a Flogging And faith I believe I look'd monstrous silly not unlike a condemned Schoolboy However as it has been always a Rule invariable with me whenever I am on the wrong Side of the Question to carry Matters  with an high Hand and behaving myself as the injured Person to astonish my Plaintiff into Silence by the unexpectedness of the Re∣tort I resolved not to be wanting to myself in the present Attack and had already prepared a tolera∣ble Volley of Recrimination to counterpoise my Antagonist when my Expectations were very agree∣ably disappointed So far from arraigning me with all the just Resentment of an injured Parent he only censured me mildly for the Precipitancy and Unkindness of my Conduct towards him and after sagaciously remarking which I suppose he had discovered in his Way from  Edinburgh  as well as ourselves that  What was done  could not be undone  and that  We should always make the best of a bad Bargain  with a few more pretty Proverbials of the same Sort he absolutely found me Guilty only of Petty Larceny and enquired kindly after his Daughter desiring to see her I need not tell you my Amazement at a Reception so entirely unhoped for nor of the many Vows and Protestations I gave him in return for it I ran up Stairs to  Kitty  whom I found with Miss  Rugg  at her Elbow in no small Consterna∣tion My Intelligence was Spirits of Hartshorn to her Down she came instantly not forgetting however to look as Melancholy and Repentant as possible and threw herself at  his Feet He immediately raised her up you know and so then after allowing a sufficient Quantity of Slobbering and Blessing and White Handkerchief Work all was well again I believe we are all apt to form Judgments of People in Pro∣portion to their good or bad Beha∣viour towards ourselves and in∣deed we should be sad Wretches if we did not shew some such Gra∣titude to our Benefactors but I really think I never knew old  Hartley  so agreeable or felt half so much regard for him as at present We all get our Health here as well as can be expected and both young and old are exceed∣ingly Convivial In about a Week your poor Brother's SlipKnot is  to be drawn tight and according to old  Hartley  I am likely to come in for a second Edition of Matri∣mony as he seems not at all satis∣fied with the Validity of any Thing on the other Side the  Tweed  So "in for a Penny in for a Pound" as they say I have nothing to do but submit myself And yet I don't know  Charles  a  Double Knot  is confoundedly difficult to be untied though one should have ever so great a Mind for it Well God help us poor Souls since we must  March Two and Two  Newgate  Fashion  as  Bardolph  says God help us say I and keep us all from Quarrelling and that we may not hate one another  is the sincere Wish and Prayer of  William Easy  the married Man  I had almost forgot to tell you that I could not rest till I had en∣deavoured to find out the Cause of  Hartley  's wonderful Acquiescence and where his Rarity of a Com∣panion had bestowed himself Upon enquiring of his Servant I found that his Master upon first missing us which was about two Hours after our Departure flew into a most violent Passion and would have prepared for an im∣mediate Pursuit now I did not imagine he would have pursued us at all but that upon  Pedant  's overpersuasion they delayed it till the next Morning That upon their Arrival at  Edinburgh  finding  the Turtles paired and flown the old Gentleman appeared very thoughtful and hearing some how or other of our Intention to visit  Foxhall  he determined to follow us thither and proposed it to his Companion who seemingly ac∣quiesced But that next Morning upon his enquiring after him at Breakfast no  Pedant  was to be found nor any body that could give the smallest Account of him Old  Hartley  was inconsolable and People were just beginning to pro∣pose a grand Searching of Horseponds Hogtubs and I suppose Necessaries had there been any when one of the Postilions or Bootcatchers recollected that he had seen a maddish looking Gentle∣man go out of their House very  early in the Morning to a StageCoach that was passing which he believed he went away with but could not tell whether it was in the Inside or the Basket So here all our Wonderments are unriddled and our Reception accounted for For the sneaking Animal you see finding all his Hopes at an End thinks proper to slink off and leave  Hartley  to make the best of it This piques the old Gentleman who begins at last to open his Eyes a little and perceive what a Fool he has been And so considering as he says that  What is done cannot be undone  he resolves to put the best Face upon Things and make up his Mind as well as he can about it before he sees us I wondered what the Deuce made  him so amazingly  Piano  upon the Occasion but this clears up the Mystery And as for  Pedant  he has shewn his Wisdom too For to be sure his Appearance at the Baronet's must have been rather a silly one circumstanced as he was like Squire  Gawkey  at the End of a Pantomime when he finds  Har∣lequin  in full Possession of his Mis∣tress So All's well that Ends well that I may conclude like my Fatherinlaw with a Proverb and I forthwith subscribe myself  Yours sincerely  W Easy  FINIS
