 THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  VOL I  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  'TIS SO PAT TO ALL THE TRIBE  EACH SWEARS THAT WAS LEVELLED AT ME  GAY  VOLUME I  LONDON  PRINTED FOR SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS NO OXFORDSTREET  PREFACE  EVERY man of determined inquiry who will ask without the dread of discovering more than he dares believe what is divinity what is law what is physic what is war and what is trade will have great reason to doubt at some times of the virtue and at others of the utility of each of these different employments What profession should a man of principle who is anxiously desirous to promote individual and general happiness chuse for his son The question has perplexed many parents and certainly deserves a serious examination Is a novel a good mode for discussing it or a  proper vehicle for moral truth Of this some perhaps will be inclined to doubt Others whose intellectual powers were indubitably of the first order have considered the art of novel writing as very essentially connected with moral instruction Of this opinion was the famous Turgot who we are told affirmed that more grand moral truths had been promulgated by novel writers than by any other class of men  But though I consider the choice of a profession as the interesting question agitated in the following work I have endeavoured to keep another important inquiry continually in view This inquiry is the growth of intellect Philosophers have lately paid much attention to the progress of mind the  subject is with good reason become a favourite with them and the more the individual and the general history of man is examined the more proofs do they discover in support of his perfectability Man is continually impelled by the vicissitudes of life to great vicissitudes of opinion and conduct He is a being necessarily subject to change and the inquiry of wisdom ought continually to be how may he change for the better From individual facts and from them alone can general knowledge be obtained  Two men of different opinions were once conversing The one scoffed at innate ideas instinctive principles and occult causes the other was a believer in natural gifts and an active fabricator of suppositions  Suggest but the slightest hint and he would erect a hypothesis which no argument at least none that he would listen to could overthrow So convinced was he of the force of intuitive powers and natural propensities as existing in himself that having proposed to write a treatise to prove that apple trees might bear oysters or something equally true and equally important he was determined he said to seek for no exterior aid or communication from books or things or men being convinced that the activity of his own mind would afford intuitive argument of more worth than all the adulterated and suspicious facts that experience could afford  To this his antagonist replied he knew but of one mode of obtaining  knowledge which was by the senses Whether this knowledge entered at the eye the ear the papillary nerves the olfactory or by that more general sense which we call feeling was he argued of little consequence but at some or all of these it must enter for he had never discovered any other inlet If however the system of his opponent were true he could only say that in all probability his intended treatise would have been written in the highest perfection had he begun and ended it before he had been born  If this reasoning be just I think we may conclude that the man of forty will be somewhat more informed than the infant who has but just seen the light Deductions of a like kind will teach us that the  collective knowledge of ages is superior to the rude dawning of the savage state and if this be so of which I find it difficult to doubt it surely is not absolutely impossible but that men may continue thus to collect knowledge and that ten thousand years hence if this good world should last so long they may possibly learn their alphabet in something less time than we do even now in these enlightened days  For these reasons I have occasionally called the attention of the reader to the lessons received by the principal character of the following work to the changes they produced in him and to the progress of his understanding I conclude with adding that in my opinion all well  written books that discuss the actions of men are in reality so many histories of the progress of mind and if what I now suppose be truth it is highly advantageous to the reader to be aware of this truth  THE ADVENTURES OF HUGH TREVOR  CHAP I  MY BIRTH FAMILY DIGNITY INSULTED RESENTMENT OF MY GRANDFATHER PARENTAL TRAITS OF CHARACTER  THERE are moments in which every man is apt to imagine that the history of his own life is the most important of all histories The gloom and sunshine with which my short existence has been chequered lead me to suppose that a narrative of these vicissitudes may be interesting to others as well as to myself  In the opinion of some people my misfortunes began before I was born The rector of * * * my grandfather  was as vain or his ancestry as a German baron and perhaps with no less reason being convinced that Adam himself was his great progenitor My mother not having the fear of her father before her eyes forgetful of the family dignity disgraced herself and contaminated the blood of her offspring by marrying a farmer's son Had she married a gentleman what that very different being which a gentleman doubtless must have generated might have been is more than I as I now am can pretend to divine As it is however low it may sink me in the reader's opinion truth obliges me to own I am but of a mongrel breed  The delinquency of my mother was aggravated by the daringness of her disobedience for the rector having a foresight of what was likely to happen had laid his express command on her never to see Hugh Trevor my father more on the very night that she eloped Add to  which she had the example of an elder sister to terrify her from such dereliction of duty who having married a rake had been left a widow poor desolate and helpless and obliged to live an unhappy dependent on her offended father 'I'll please my eye though I break my heart' said my mother  She kept her word Young Hugh was an athletic well proportioned handsome man of a sanguine temper prone to pleasure a frequenter of wakes and fairs and much addicted to speculate particularly in cards cocking and horseracing  Discarded by the rector who was obstinately irreconcileable my mother went with her husband to reside in the house of her fatherinlaw Folly visits all orders of men Farmers as well as lords and rectors can be proud of their families The match was considered as an acquisition of dignity to the house of  Trevor and my mother bringing such an addition of honour was most graciously received  Here she remained something more than a year and here ten months after the marriage I was born I had not openly assumed the form which the vanity of man has dignified with divine above a fortnight before my grandfather Trevor died He had been what is usually called a good father had lived in reputation and had brought up a large and expensive family But as good in this sense usually signifies indulgent not wise he had rather afforded his children the means and taught them the art of spending money than of saving His circumstances were suspected the creditors were hasty to prefer their claims and it soon appeared that he had died insolvent The family was consequently dispersed and I thus early was in danger of being turned a poor wailing imbecil  wanderer on a world in which the sacred rights of  meum  and  tuum  daily suffer thousands to perish  Fortunately considering the exigence of the moment my father who was enterprising adroit and loquacious prevailed on some friends to lend him money to stock the farm of the lease of which he was now in possession In this he succeeded the more easily because he had already acquired the character of an excellent judge of agricultural affairs He was known to be acute at driving bargains could value sheep heifers steers and bullocks better than a Leicestershire drover was an excellent judge of horse flesh and during his fathers's life had several times proved he knew the exact moment of striking earnest Had fate sent him to a minister's levee instead of a market for quadrupeds he would have been a great politician He would have bought and sold with as much dexterity  as any dealer in black cattle the kingdom can boast  At the first approach of misfortune my mother had felt great despondency but when she saw her young husband so active animated and fruitful in resource her hopes presently began to brighten The parish where the rector resided was four miles from Trevor farm and the desolate prospect that at first presented itself to the imagination of my mother had induced her to write with no little contrition and all the pathos she could collect to implore pardon for her offence But in vain Her humiliation intreaties and dread of want excited sensations of triumph and obduracy but not of compassion in the bosom of the man of God The rector was implacable his pride was wounded his prejudices insulted and his anger rouzed He had beside his own money in his own pocket and there he was willing it should remain Now we  all know that pride prejudice anger and avarice are four of the most perverse imps the  dramatis personae  of the passions can afford The irreparable wrong done to the family dignity and the proper vengeance it became parental authority to inflict on such presumption as my father had been guilty of and such derogatory meanness as that of my mother were inexhaustible themes  The severity of her father rendered the fortunate efforts of her husband tenfold delightful They mutually exulted in that futurity that should enable them to set the unkind rector at defiance and Hugh often boasted he would prove though but a farmer that the blood in his veins was as warm and perhaps as pure as that of any proud parson's in the kingdom  These were pleasant and flourishing but fleeting days My father when he went to the fair to purchase his team  happened to see a fine hunter on sale It was a beautiful beast Who could forbear to prefer him and his noble form high blood and spirited action to the slouching dull and clumsy carthorse Hugh Trevor was not a man so deficient in taste he therefore instead of a team of five brought home three horses for the plough and this high bred hunter for his pleasure My mother herself when she saw the animal and heard her husband's encomiums could not but admire nay she had even some inclination to approve especially when she listened to what follows  'My dear Jane' said my father to her after alighting from the back of his hunter which he had walked trotted and galloped to convince her how perfect he was in all his paces  My dear Jane we have an excellent farm the land is in good condition the fences sound and the soil rich no man in this county  understands seeding cropping and marketing better than I do we shall improve our stock and double our rent  it was a hundred and fifty pounds per annum  the first year I shall soon meet with a smart nag fit for the side saddle and shall easily make you a good horse woman and then when the seed is in the ground we may be allowed to take a little pleasure Perhaps we may ride by the rector's door and if he should not ask us in we will not break our hearts Who knows but in time we may have cause to be as purse proud as himself  My father as it appears was sanguine high spirited and not without resentment My mother though her fancy was not quite so active did not think his reasoning much amiss and recollected the jaunts they were to take between seed time and harvest with complacency  CHAP II  PROGRESS OF MY EDUCATION AND CONJECTURES ON ITS CONSEQUENCES  BOLD in his projects lucky in his bargains and fertile in resources every thing for a time which my father undertook seemed to prosper  In the interim I grew apace and according to the old phrase was my father's pride and my mother's joy His free humour and the delight she took in exhibiting her boy had occasioned me in early infancy to be handed from arm to arm and so familiarized to a variety of countenances as soon to be entirely exempted from the usual fears of childen My father's bargains and sales brought me continually acquainted with strange faces He was vain of me fond of having me with him and as he called it of casehardening me I became full of prattle inquisitive had an incessant flow of  spirits and often put interrogatories so whimsical or so uncommon as to make myself remarkably amusing  From inclination indeed and not from plan my father took some trouble in my education which I suspect was productive of unforeseen effects He played with me as a cat does with her kitten and taught me all the tricks of which he was master They were chiefly indeed of a bodily kind such as holding me over his head erect on the palm of his hand putting me into various postures making me tumble in as many ways as he could devise pitching me on the back of his hunter and accustoming me to sit on full trot with abundance of other antics at which he found me apt yet being accompanied with laughter and shouts and now and then a hard knock they tended or I am mistaken not only to give bodily activity but to awaken some of the powers of  mind among which one of the foremost is fortitude Insomuch that since I have had the honour to become a philosopher I have begun to doubt whether hereafter when the world shall be wiser the art of tumbling may not possibly supercede the art of dancing But this by the by  Nor was my mother on her part altogether deficient in activity Exclusive of providing me with a sister who from some accident or other was but a puling wrangling rickety young lady she initiated me in the mysteries and pleasures of the alphabet The rector had taken some trouble to make his daughters good English scholars and my mother though she had retained much of his solemn song could not only read currently and articulate clearly but made some attempts to understand what she read It must be acknowledged however that her efforts were but feeble  I know not how it happened that I very early became in love with this divine art but such was the fact I could spell boldly at two years and a half old and in less than six months more could read the collects epistles and gospels without being stopped by one word in twenty Soon afterward I attacked the Bible and in a few months the tenth chapter of Nehemiah himself could not terrify me My father bought me many tragical ditties such as Chevy Chace the Children in the Wood Death and the Lady and which were infinitely the richest gems in my library Robin Hood's Garland and the History of Jack the Giantkiller To render these treasures more captivating observing the delight it gave me he used sometimes to sing the adventures of Robin Hood with me whether to the right tunes or to music of his own composing is more than I know  By accidents of this and the like kind  I became so much my father's plaything and toy that his affairs then going on prosperously he put me in breeches before I was four years old bought me a pony which he christened Gray Bob buckled me to the saddle for safety and with a leading rein used frequently to take me with him to markets fairs and races  But before I proceed to relate more of my infantine adventures it will be necessary to introduce a kinsman of mine to the reader's acquaintance of whom though the alliance were now of some standing he has yet never heard  CHAP III  RATIONAL COURTSHIP AND PRUDENT VIEWS OF WIDOWED LOVERS A STRANGE DOUBT HINTED THE HUSBAND'S CODE LAWS ARE QUICKLY PRESCRIBED AND YES IS EASILY SAID  I HAVE already mentioned my aunt her imprudent first marriage the rector's  resentment who used to pronounce himself the most unfortunate of men in undutiful children and her irksome dependence on his bounty With this aunt Mr Elford a man of much worth considerable knowledge and great integrity of intention became acquainted and by a variety of motives was prompted to pay her his addresses  No people are so certain of the happiness of a state of wedlock as a couple courting Some difference however must be made between lovers who have never married and lovers who having made the experiment find it possible that a drop of gall may now and then embitter the cup of honey My aunt's first husband had been a man of an easy disposition and readily swayed to good or ill She had seldom suffered contradiction from him or heard reproach A kind of good humoured indolence had accustomed him rather to ward off accusation with banter  or to be silent under it than to contend His extravagance had obliged her to study the strictest economy she therefore was the ostensible person she regulated she corrected she complained She had a tincture of the rector in her composition and her husband's follies afforded sufficient opportunities for the exercise of her office  After his death which happened early the wrecks of his originally small fortune scarcely afforded her subistence for a year By many humble but grating concessions on her part and no less proud upbraidings on the part of her father she was first allowed a trifling annuity almost too scanty to afford the means of life and as it were in resentment to the unpardonable conduct of my mother was afterward permitted to return to the parsonage house  The state of subjection in which she was kept the dissatisfaction this evidently  created the gloom that was visible in her countenance and that seemed to oppress her heart added to a disconsolate and habitual taciturnity soon occasioned Mr Elford to consider her with compassion and the very questioncan I not afford her relief gave birth to ideas of a still more tender nature  These were seconded by a retrospect to his own situation He had lost a beloved wife who had left him an infant daughter in whose future felicity he was strongly interested He had often considered the subject of education and had become the determined enemy of boardingschools where every thing is taught and nothing understood where airs graces mouth primming shouldersetting and elbowholding are studied and affectation formality hypocrisy and pride are acquired and where children the most promising are presently transformed into vain pert misses who imagine  that to perk up their heads turn out their toes and exhibit the ostentatious opulence of their relations in a tawdry ball night dress is the summit of perfection  Determined that his child should be sent to no such academy he considered a second marriage as necessary Though an excellent economist he was utterly a stranger to avarice My aunt was neither rich nor handsome nor young being according to the rector's account on the debtor side of his books of an adust complection atrabilarious in look and temper thirtyfour and two years older than Mr Elford But he imagined he could make her happy or at least could relieve her from a state little less than miserable He likewise supposed that she was well fitted to promote plans which he held to be wise Errors in moral calculations frequently escape undetected even by the most accurate  But as he was very sincere and honest in his intentions he thought proper while paying his court to her to explain what his expectations were and the reasons on which they were grounded His system was there must be government and if government there must be governors This by the by I believe to be a radical mistake in politics though I likewise believe there is not one man in fifty thousand who would not scoff at me for the supposition Proceeding in his hypothesis he concluded that the strongest understanding had a prescriptive and inherent right to govern and with great candour thus laying down the law to my aunt he undisguisedly avowed a conviction that his understanding was the strongest and that to govern would be his inherent right  His words were so powerful his arguments so excellent his statement of them so clear and all his deductions  so indubitable that my aunt had not the least objection to offer "That must be allowedthat cannot be denied nothing can be more reasonable"were her continual answers  The consequence of all this was a marriage and my aunt having been noted for her prudence during the life of her first husband though not indeed in having made him her husband and Mr Elford's character for propriety rectitude and good intention being still more permanently established there was not the least doubt entertained especially by the parties but that this would be a happy match  Having thus brought the reader and Mr Elford together I must now proceed to relate the manner in which I myself and my good uncle first became acquainted  CHAP IV  MY CURIOSITY LEADS ME INTO DANGER BUT INTRODUCES ME TO A FRIEND WHO DISCOVERS THAT HE IS MY UNCLE  IN the month of August and the city of ***** a fair is annually held in which during those halcyon days of prosperity my father was an active trafficker Thither the neighbouring gentry yeomanry and dealers in general repaired as the best mart in the county at which to expend their money It was fifteen miles from Trevor farm  Curiosity is an incessant impulse to youth I intreated to go and my petition was favourably received When we were there in consequence of some bargain or sale it happened that my father had occasion to ride with a farmer to a place at some distance from the fair and in the interim to leave me in the care of  the barmaid of the inn at which we had put up  He had not been long gone before I eager to see what could be seen broke loose from my keeper who was too busy to pay much attention to me and strolled into the throng I wandered about without any suspicion of danger from place to place I know not how long to drink in all the knowledge that could enter at my eyes  How I came there I cannot tell but at last it appears I had rambled into a coffeehouse put questions to the guests who found amusement in the novelty of my undaunted air appearance and prattle and having taken up a newspaper and begun to display my talent was placed upon a table to read it aloud to the company  The astonished farmers could scarcely believe their ears so much was I a fouryearold child their superior in learning  Some of them were not certain that I was not an imp of Satan so utterly did my performance exceed credibility My beauty too at this age was uncommon my limbs were straight and strong my cheeks of the purest red and white and my full flaxen hair hung in short ringlets down my neck The mistress and barmaid kissed me the men gave me money and they all eagerly enquired who I was where I was going and how I had come there  In the height of this scene it happened that Mr Elford came in who though two years married to my aunt till that time had never seen me Though his understanding prevented any stupid wonder yet he felt uncommon emotion for a child unknown to every body yet happy and fearless and so attractive in manners form and intelligence He asked what was my name I answered little Hugh From whence did I come From home  Who brought me Gray BobWhere was I going To see the fair  In the midst of these interrogatories a beggar with a child at her back and another that she led came into the coffeeroom In one hand I had a cake given me by one of the company which I had begun to eat and in the other the money that the kindness and amazement of my auditors had forced upon me The woman intreated piteously for relief and the landlord angry that his guests should be disturbed advanced to turn her out She again intreated with great earnestness for charity That she inspired me with some share of pity seems certain for I held out my hand with the money to her and saidHere  Pleased with my promptness Mr Elford bade her take it and she obeyed The child at her back seeing my cake stretched out its arm I understood its language and was going to give it the  cake but checked myself and said No you must not have all your brother must have a bit and broke it between them Seized with one of those emotions to which some few people are subject Mr Elford snatched me in his arms kissed me and exclaimedMy good boy I prophecy thou wilt one day be a brave fellow  Just as this was passing the city bellman took his stand opposite the coffeehouse door and with his O  yes  gave notice that I was lost concluding with a description of my age dress name and place of abode  Mr Elford immediately conjectured his business went to listen was struck when he heard the particulars and hastily returned to ask me if my name was Hugh Trevor I answered yes little Hugh He instantly ran after the bellman told him the boy was found and I was conducted by Mr Elford and the  bellman with a crowd in their retinue back to my terrified father between whom and my uncle an acquaintance from this time commenced  CHAP V  BENEVOLENT STRATAGEM OF MY UNCLE DEFEATED BY THE UNLUCKY AND FOOLISH TRIUMPH OF MY FATHER THE ANGER AND OATH OF THE RECTOR  MR ELFORD cultivated a small estate of his own lying about ten miles from Trevor farm and beyond that village of which my grandfather was the spiritual guide The daughter for whose sake he had first been prompted to marry again was dead and this perhaps was one cause that strengthened his affection for me He frequently rode over to visit us made himself my playmate and favourite encouraged a greater degree of  intimacy between the sisters who were not too cordially inclined toward each other and soon obtained permission to take me home with him for a fortnight The disposition he shewed to aid my father and the possibility that I might one day be his heir readily induced my parents to comply  Mr Elford as his history will shew was perhaps liable to greater mistakes than might have been expected from a man of so much understanding ardour and goodness of intention but though like other men occasionally blind to his own errors he could not but feel pain at the obduracy of the rector's conduct toward my mother For this reason on my first visit to his house he concerted a plan by which he hoped to effect a reconciliation From the incidents that occurred I think it probable that he would have accomplished his purpose had it not been for a trick that my father  played by which this well meant scheme was rendered abortive  Squire Mowbray the lord of the manor in which lay the village where my grandfather lived kept his coach and his post chariot The rector who had a secret enmity to him or rather to that influence by which his own power was diminished kept his coach and his post chariot too lest he should openly avow inferiority and his dignity be called in question To add to these honours he was drawn by a pair of bays  It happened that one of these animals became unfit for service was sold and another was wanting as his successor A neighbouring horsebreeder had one that was a good match and for which the rector had bidden money but not enough My father in the mean time had purchased this and other horses of the owner and the rector when it was too late sent to offer the man his own price  The breeder made application to my father to have the horse again with an allowance of profit to which he consented till he was accidentally told for whom the horse was designed Flushed with temporary success and fallacious hopes Hugh was happy to find an opportunity of shewing that he could resent as well as the rector and exultingly swore he should not have the horse if he would purchase him at his weight in gold  The message with a due increase of insulting aggravation was conveyed to the divine who was so exasperated by this audacious act of insolence and gratuitous rebellion that he went down on his knees and took a solemn oath never to forget or forgive the injury  Whether this became an apostle of peace or whether divines are all and unexceptionably apostles of peace are questions which I do not here pretend to analyze  Ignorant of this event and glowing with the desire of affording me a grandfather's protection Mr Elford pursued his little plot The rector had always wished for a male heir the offspring of his own loins but in this he had not been indulged by those powers that regulate such matters A son of his own being therefore past hope Mr Elford imagined he might perhaps find consolation in the succedaneum of a grandson  Accordingly a few days after my arrival at his house where I was to stay a fortnight he invited the rector who had never yet seen me to dinner Without telling him who I was my uncle made me so diverting by the art with which he knew how to manage me that the old gentleman quite surprized declared I was a very extraordinary child  So fearless and free was my behaviour that the rector and I presently became  familiar I shook hands with him sat on his knee felt in his pocket gave him the history of Gray Bob and asked for a penny to buy me a whip My request being granted I wanted immediately to have a horse saddled that I might ride to market and make my purchase and the good humour with which I received the information that this was a favour not to be obtained further gained on the old theologian's heart I asked if he had a horse He answered yes he had many horses and that if I would go home with him he would let me ride them all Come let us go said I taking hold of his hand and pulling him  Mr Elford waiting for the proper moment and interrupting me asked my grandfatherIf you Sir had but such a little fellow of your own what would you do with himDo exclaimed the rector I would make a man of him Oh that he had been mine twenty years  agoAnd why not O that he were mine now answered Mr ElfordI could be well contented that he were As he said this the rector strange to tell sighedYour wishes then are gratified continued Mr Elford he is your own"How""Your grandson"  The reverend pastor was taken by surprise Certain associations had been set afloat and the desire of realizing the vision had for a moment obliterated the recollection of revenge Go Hugh said Mr Elford and kiss your grandfather Without asking any questions or shewing the least token of reluctance I went up to him as I was bidden to give the kiss but my goodhumoured face stretched out arms and projecting chin were presented in vain the words Hugh and grandfather had conjured up the fiend and the rector sat motionless  Not accustomed to meet and therefore not expecting repulse I climbed up  his chair stayed myself by the breast of his coat and sat down on his knee The recollection of his daughter's crime his contaminated blood and the insufferable insolence of my father came strongly upon him He scowled at me seized me by the arms flung me from him with something like violence and walked hastily out of the house  The tide of passion ran so high that he would not stay to dine but departed muttering anger at the conduct of Mr Elford and repeating asseverations of eternal resentment and maledictions against undutiful children  Mr Elford felt an emotion something stronger than grief to see a pastor of the flock of Christ thus cherish the spirit of persecution On me the scene made but little impression I had no apprehension that the day was coming when this inflexible guide of Christians would find his prayers effectual and his prophecies of  vengeance fulfilled How could I know that there was so hateful a vice as malignity The holy seer did not indeed indulge his wrath quite so far as Elisha at least not openly he did not curse me in the name of the Lord nor did shebears come out of the wood to devour me but I soon enough had my share of misfortune Preachers of peace it appears were always irritable but to do them justice I believe they are something less so now than they were of old  CHAP VI  MY DIFFERENT PRECEPTORS AND EARLY PROPENSITIES I RIDE TO HUNT WITH MY FATHER WHICH IS PRODUCTIVE OF A STRANGE AND TERRIBLE ADVENTURE  MY father's affairs still continued to wear the appearance of success and by the aid of Mr Elford he extended his speculations For some few years my  time passed merrily away Under the tuition of my father I gained health strength and intrepidity and was taught to sip ale eat hung beef ride like a hero climb trees run jump and swim that as he said I might face the world without fear I grew strong of muscle and my thews and sinews became alert and elastic in the execution of their office  To my uncle I was indebted for hints and notions of a more refined and elevated nature By familiar instances he endeavoured to make me distinguish between resisting wrongs and revenging them and to feel the pleasure not only of aiding the weak but of pardoning the vanquished  From the books which I found in his house I likewise early acquired a religious propensity which was encouraged by my aunt with all her power and seconded by my mother Their education  and the dogmas they had heard from the rector had given them very high notions of the dignity of the clerical character in the superior presence of which temporal things laymen and civil magistracy itself sunk into insignificance The perusal of Fox's Book of Martyrs of which I was so fond that I would sit with my aunt for hours before I was eight years old and read it to her aided their efforts and this childhood bias as will be seen greatly influenced my first pursuits in life We are all the creatures of the necessities under which we exist The history of man is but the history of these necessities and of the impulse emotion or mind by them begotten Of the incidents of my childhood that which made the deepest impression upon me I am now going to relate  The daring Hugh my father who feared no colours had long been accustomed whenever he could find time and  often indeed when he could not to follow the fox hounds and hunt with his landlord the Squire himself Among his other bargains he had lately bought one of the Squire's brood mares Bay Meg that had been sold because she had twice cast her foal On the eve of my ninth returning birthday being in a gay humour he was seldom sad he said to me I shall go out tomorrow morning with Squire Mowbray's hounds Hugh will you get up and go with me My heart bounded at the proposal Yes said I Lord husband exclaimed my mother would you break the child's neck There is no fear retorted I Well said Hugh continued my father you shall ride Bay Meg you are but a feather she will carry you with ease and will not run away with you Never fear that replied I stoutly My mother at first made some opposition but my father laughed and I coaxed intreated and  teazed till she complied for this was by no means the first scene of the kind  I went to bed with an overjoyed heart and a head so full of the morrow that I was up dressed and ready the first in the house The horses were brought out my father and I mounted we soon came up with the sportsmen and away we went in quest of a fox  We were at first unlucky and it was late in the day before Reynard was found but about noon the hounds opened he started in view and the sport began  The chace happened to be long heavy and continued for many miles My father was an eager sportsman He valued himself both upon his hunter and his horsemanship and who should be first in at the death was an honour that he would contend with the keenest sportsman in the kingdom though it were the Squire himself The running was so severe that Bay Meg became willing to lag  He looked behind called after me to push on and I obeyed and laid on her with whip and heel as lustily as I could My father anxious to keep sight of me yet not lose the hounds pulled in a little and the hunted animal in hopes of finding cover made toward a wood Being prevented from entering it he skirted along its sides and turning the corner the hindmost sportsmen followed by a short cut through the wood  Keeping my eye on my father I likewise struck into the wood but taking a wrong direction was presently entangled among the trees and brambles and entirely at a loss I afterward learned that my father having lost sight of me for some minutes stopped hoping I should come up and then rode back to seek me while I was spurring forward in a contrary line  After many efforts stoppages and windings I at last made my way through  the wood and came to the entrance of an extensive heath The hounds though at a great distance were still in hearing and Bay Meg accustomed to the sport erected her ears and listened after them with great attention For some time longer she obeyed the whip and increased her gallop evidently with a desire to come up with them but after a while finding they were out of hearing she grew sulky slackened her pace tired and at last fairly stood still I had been so much used to horses that perceiving her humour I had the sagacity to turn her head homeward and she then went on again though with a sullen and sluggish pace  On looking round however and considering my alarm began I was in the middle of an extensive heath or moor with no living creature house or object in sight except here and there a scattered shrub and a few sheep It was winter and the day was far advanced add to  this the wind had risen and when I turned about was in my face and blew a sharp sleet which then began to fall full in my eyes half blinded me and the mare and offended her nostrils so much that she once more wheeled about and refused to proceed either one way or the other  Not yet quite daunted while I was making every effort to bring her round a gust of wind blew off my hat Forgetting that Bay Meg was tall and I short and that there was neither gate nor mounting stone to be seen I alighted to recover my hat Being down to get up again was impossible my foot could not reach the stirrup  The lowering sky the approach of darkness and the utter desert in which I found myself at length conjured up the full distress of the scene which seized upon my imagination and I burst into tears  I continued sobbing crying and tugging  at Bay Meg till night had fairly overtaken us At last I found myself beside some white railing which was the boundary of a race course within the distance This at first seemed to promise me relief with great difficulty I coaxed Bay Meg up to it climbed upon the railing and hoped once more to mount But in vain the perverse animal set her face to me nor could any language I was master of prevail on her to approach sideways and if I lifted my whip she did but run backward and pull me down  This contest continued I know not how long till quite hopeless I gave it up and again proceeded to lead her not knowing where or in what direction I was going After a time the moon appeared and a very indifferent afternoon was succeeded by a fine night I continued sobbing but still proceeded as fast as I could prevail on Bay Meg to follow me till propitious fortune brought me to a road  where the wheels had cut deep ruts and the tread of horses had left the ridges high Here I once again essayed to mount and by the help of the stirrup succeeded  Still I knew not where I was nor what to do except that my only chance was to go on  I had not proceeded far before the traces of road began to diminish and I struck into another path that seemed more beaten This gradually disappeared and I soon found myself on the level greensward without any marks of footting for my guide To relieve this new distress I turned to the right hoping again to recover the track I had lost instead of which after riding on I know not how far I found the heath begin to grow marshy Again I turned but so unfortunately that every step the mare set sunk her deeper and deeper in a bog till at last she could not drag herself out My  danger was extreme but I rightly conjectured the bog would support me singly better than it would me and the mare I therefore jumped off kept hold of the bridle which I threw over her head and by shifting my ground prevented myself from sinking very deep while I continued my endeavours to relieve the mare She made a lucky plunge and I turning her head in a different direction as much as possible found myself in part released from this danger though I was obliged to proceed every step with the utmost precaution  Once more dismounted wearied and despairing I had no resource but to wander I knew not whither or lie down perishing with cold on a damp moor while a severe frost was setting in Great as my distress was I had too much courage to sink under it and I went on giving some relief to my affliction by sobs and tears  These various circumstances continued till the night began to be far advanced but after two or three hours of most tedious and weary wandering I again came to a rising ground by the help of which with great efforts I once more contrived to mount I was no sooner in the saddle than I thought I saw a light at a distance which sometimes seemed to glimmer and as often disappeared Toward this however I determined to direct my course and proceeded losing and recovering it till I could catch sight of it no more  Continuing in the same direction for some time I came to a barn Benumbed fatigued and ready as I was to drop from the saddle I entered it as joyfully as a shipwrecked sailor climbs a barren rock I scarcely could dismount and it was with great difficulty I could unbuckle and take off the bridle of Bay Meg but my hands were so frost bitten  and my perseverance so exhausted that the saddle was beyond my ability I therefore shut the door and left her to feed on what she could find while I went and laid myself down among some trusses of straw that were heaped on one side  The pain of my thawing hands would not immediately suffer me to go to sleep and just as it was beginning to decrease and I to slumber the door opened and a woman came in My fears were again alarmed for as I listened I heard her weep bitterly In no long time afterward a man leaned forward through the door and said"Mary Art thou there" To which she replied with a sob "Yea Tummas I be here"  My half frozen blood and my fears again afloat made me tremble through every limb and there was something in the grief of the woman and particularly in the voice of the man which had  no tendency to calm my agitation I could see distinctly for the moon shone full in at the door He entered the barn they sat down together and after some trifling questions I heard the following dialogue  "And so Mary thou say'st thou beest with child"  "Yea Tummas that I too surely be the more is my hard hap"  "And what dost thou mean to do"  "Nay Tummas what doon you mean to do"  "No matter for thatThou threatest me last night that thou wouldst swear thy bastard to me"  "For shame for shame Tummas to talk o'that'n If it mun be a bastard thou well knowest it is a bastard of thy own begetting"  "I know better"  "Oh Christ Tummas canst thou look in my face and tell me that"  "Yea I can"  "Thou art a base false man Tummas"  "Don't call names"  "Thou knowest thou art What canst thou hope for after swearing so wickedly as thou didst to be true to me and marry me but that the devil should come for thee alive"  "No matter for that If I must go to the devil it shall not be for nothing But mayhap thou hadst a better a kept a good tongue in thy head"  "Thou hadst a better a kept an honest one in thine Tummas"  "I'll make thee repent taunting me as thou hast done afore folks and  threaping  and  threating  to lay thy bastard at my door"  "Do thy worst Thou hast brought me to shame and misery and hast sworn thyself to the bottomless pit what canst thou do more"  "Thou shalt see"  As he said this he deliberately drew a  knife from his pocket and began to whet it upon his shoeI was breathless my hair stoodan endThe woman exclaimed  "Jesus God Tummas What dost thou mean"  "Say thy prayers"  "Merciful Saviour Why thou wilt not murder me Tummas"  "Thou shalt never go alive out of this place"  "Christ have mercy upon my sinful soul"  "I'll do thy business"  "For the gracious love of the merciful heaven Tummas bethink thyself"  "I'll teach thee to swear thy ugly bastard brat to me"  "I wunnot Tummas I wunnot For Christ Jesus sake bethink thyself Dunnot murder me Tummas Oh dunnot murder me I'll never trouble thee Tummas while I have breath I'll never trouble thee Indeed indeed I wunnot"  "I know thee better tomorrow thou would'st tell all this and all"  "Never Tummas as God shall pardon my sins never never never"  The poor creature screamed with agony while the determined fellow kept whetting his knife At last she made a sudden spring and endeavoured to seize his arm but missing her aim he immediately struck her with his fist and began to stab her  Unable to contain myself I shrieked with no less horror and vociferation than the poor mangled creature The mare herself took fright and sprang with the snorting of terror and clattering of hoofs with her shoulder against the door endeavouring to get out  This unexpected noise aiding his guilt inspired the murdering wretch with instantaneous dread and he immediately took to flight leaving the woman weltering in her blood groaning and as I supposed expiring  Impelled by my fears and the horror of the scene I had no longer any feeling of cold or sense of debility I ran to the door shut it and finding a fork that stood beside it made as good a cross barfastening as I was able I then resolutely set my own shoulder to it and there remained I know not how long in momentary dread the murderer would return The woman's groans seemed to diminish as if she were dying and I durst neither stir nor speak for I feared to do any thing but listen  The energy of my terror was so great that it was very very long before I was weary enough of my situation to be obliged to move Fatigue and a dead silence without at length however induced me first to change my position and after a time gradually and with great caution to open the door and look out Neither hearing nor seeing any thing I waited awhile and then ventured so far  as to walk round the barn though in the utmost trepidation and possessed by the most horrid fears which were increased by a great increase of darkness the moon being then either descending or hidden behind the clouds  Having made no discoveries except that every thing was quiet I once more entered the barn where all was still as death The woman had ceased to groan nor could I though I listened with the most solicitous attention hear her breathe Horror returned in all its force and I stood immoveable unknowing what to resolve on or what to attempt At length I took courage and exclaimed "In the name of God if you are alive speak"  The very sound of my own voice inspired unutterable terror which was augmented by a heavy and long confined groan proceeding from the woman She had retained her breath fearing the return of the assassin The answer that  followed her groan was "If you are a Christian soul get me some help" I told her I was lost benighted and did not know where to go for any She replied there was a town not half a mile distant at the back of the barn and named the very place at which my aunt and uncle Elford lived  As soon as surprise and joy would permit I asked if she knew Mr Elford Her answer was "I am his servant and this is his barn"  Various recollections immediately crouded upon me and the scene and the voice of poor Mary to which a moment before I had been so utter a stranger became familiar to me It is I Mary little Hugh said I Don't you know me A dismal Oh excited no doubt by the most painful associations was her answer I desired her to be quiet and patient while I ran for aid assuring her I would soon be back for that I now  knew where I was and was perfectly acquainted with the road  Accordingly away I ran with all the speed I had to my uncle's house where when I arrived I knocked at the door pelted the window and called as vociferously as I could for them to rise The housedog barked violently and my uncle was soon at the window with my aunt at his back demanding with surprise and dissatisfaction who I was and what I wanted I exclaimed "Come down uncle A man has been murdering your maid Mary She will be dead if you do not make haste" "Good God" cried my aunt pressing forward "Child Hugh Trevor Nephew Is it you" "Yes yes aunt" answered I "make haste and try to save the poor creature's life"  The astonishment excited by such a messenger bringing such a message and at such an hour may well be imagined  Master mistress and servants were immediately in motion and the doors opened Question succeeded question exclamations were incessant and my answers quickly communicated much of the terror I myself had felt  Regulating his proceedings according to my account Mr Elford dispatched a servant to the surgeon and having prepared a hurdle by way of litter went with me and two of his men to the barn  My aunt was very loath I should return but my spirits by the various incidents of the night were much too active to suffer me to feel either hunger weariness or want of sleep and Mr Elford recollected I might be useful in preventing the terrors of poor Mary at our approach for which reason he suffered me to run before and inform her that help was coming  When I came to the barn the moment I set my foot over the threshold  my terrors of murder and of her having expired all returned After a short pause I called with a trembling voice "Mary Are you alive" and my heart bounded with joy to hear her though dolefully answer "yea"  Mr Elford and his attendants soon came up and the remainder of the story of poor Mary was that being removed and put to bed her wounds though deep and dangerous were found not to be mortal that she recovered in a few weeks and by the influence of Mr Elford was retained in my aunt's service to the great scandal of the place where it was affirmed that such hussies and their bastards ought to be whipped from parish to parish and so as I suppose whipped out of the world that in two months time she was delivered of a fine boy whom when my uncle left the country she maintained by her own hard earnings and that in the extremity of her  distress when she thought herself at the point of death she obstinately refused to declare who was her intended murderer and though by his having been known to be her  sweetheart  and his flight from the country where he never more appeared people were sufficiently convinced who the man was yet her pertinacious theme was  she would never be his accuser if God could pardon him she could  CHAP VII  MISTAKES AND FAMILY QUARRELS OF MR AND MRS ELFORD HIS DEPARTURE AND EXILE WITH THE LETTERS HE WROTE  AND now the period approached when the pleasures of the days of childhood were to terminate and when I was to experience abundance of those rude disasters under which the poor the friendless and the fatherless groan  The first stroke which the malice of fortune aimed at me was the voluntary banishment of my uncle Though I have forborne to interrupt my narrative by a recapitulation of the unhappy bickerings that took place between Mr Elford and my aunt soon after their marriage yet these bickerings were very frequent very bitter and at last very fatal Instead of the happiness which they and every body had thought so certain they were completely wretched  My youth had not prevented me lately from remarking when at their house the steady and severe silence which Mr Elford endeavoured to preserve and the fixed dissatisfaction and gloom of my aunt Notwithstanding the efforts they made especially Mr Elford not to suffer their unhappiness to extend beyond themselves it became frequently painful even for me to be in their company He indeed was often in part successful  in these efforts but she seldom or never  Their mutual discontent was the more easily increased to misery because it happened between people who each had the character of prudent and whose partiality individually acquitted them of that disorder which the want of good temper alone had produced  In making an estimate of the probable conveniences and inconveniences agreements and disagreements that might happen between them they had reciprocally been deceived  Mr Elford had endeavoured to provide against this by a plain declaration of his sentiments and expectations which Mrs Elford had too inconsiderately concluded she should continue to think rational and just She imagined there was no fear of violent quarrels between a man of so much understanding as Mr Elford and a woman so disposed to listen to reason as herself She was ignorant of the  power of habit over her temper The rector had taught her pride marriage had taught her misfortune and pride and misfortune had made her fretful melancholy and moody She had suffered no opposition from her first husband her will had been his law and she knew not till she had made the trial how difficult it is to concede with a good grace The least thing that offended her threw her into tears The passions of Mr Elford and my aunt were mutually too much inflamed for either of them to draw equitable and wise conclusions and tears he held to be a false insulting and odious mode of proclaiming him a tyrant it was to say I dare not utter my complaints in words but my tears I cannot restrain Too angry to doubt of or examine his reasons convinced of his own humanity and his desire to see and make her happy such an accusation he considered so violently unjust as to be unpardonable  It must be owned she did not confine her grief to weeping she was often seized with fits of hysteric passion in which the most outrageous and false accusations were indulged To reply to them or attempt to disprove what he knew to be so absurd he thought derogatory to innocence and the world half suspected him to be the tyrant he had been painted This increased his sense of injury and consequently did not diminish the affliction of my aunt  Of the happiness indeed which was to result from this marriage she had conceived romantic ideas and when she found herself again involved in the cares of a family liable to the control of a man who expected the utmost propriety and order who looked with a strict eye over every department and whose opinion did not always coincide with her own she became constantly peevish and her former gloom grew ten fold more  gloomy She pined after that connubial affection which their reciprocal conduct was calculated to destroy and from the hasty decisions of passion convinced herself that no part of the blame was justly her own Mr Elford was no less obstinate in the contrary opinion Taking philosophy such as he found it he like his neighbours too hastily concluded there were duties and affairs for which men were fitted but of which women were incapable Blending much truth with some falsehood he thus argued  "The leading features in the character of an amiable and good woman are mildness complacency and equanimity of temper The man if he be a provident and worthy husband is immersed in a thousand cares his mind is agitated his memory loaded and his body fatigued He returns from the bustle of the world chagrined perhaps at disappointments angry at indolent or perfidious  people and terrified lest his unavoidable connections with such people should make him appear to be indolent or perfidious himself Is this a time for the wife of his bosom his dearest most intimate friend to add to his vexations and increase the fever of an overburthened mind by a contumelious tongue or a discontented brow Business in its most prosperous state is full of anxiety labour and turmoil Oh how dear to the memory of man is that wife who clothes her face in smiles who uses gentle expressions and who makes her lap soft to receive and hush his cares to rest There is not in all nature so fascinating an object as a faithful tender and affectionate wife"  Had he wished for a wife who instead of indulging the caprice of indolence would have awakened him to energy and have taught him to be just not captious his desires would have been more rational  but to a man who had formed a system of obedience to authority and not to reason the arguments he used were irrefragable To a woman who imagined that obedience in all cases was the badge of abject slavery they were absurd Thus opposite in principle and in practice their unhappy state of existence finally became so intolerable to one of them at least as to occasion the violent measure and the painful sensations described by Mr Elford in the following letter  TO MRS ELFORD  The bitterness of unjust reproach the invectives of an ungoverned tongue the rancorous accusations of a stubborn heart these wretched as they long have made me to me are now no more Forgetful man No more You I can forsake but where shall I fly to rid myself of them You have riveted them upon me and while I have life they can never die With you I have travelled through  the vale of tears you like misery personified have held the cup of sorrow have fed me with affliction strewed thorns beneath my feet by day and wound adders round my pillow by night Absence itself cannot afford a cure Yes reconcile it to your conscience how you may you have given my peace a mortal wound  You cannot forget when I first thought of you for a wife the plainness and sincerity with which I acted I carefully stated that my family was reputable but not rich and that I was a younger brother that my wealth was not great but that it was sufficient with industry and the character I had established to gratify the desires of people whose hearts were not vitiated and whose wants were bounded I conscientiously repeated my ideas concerning the regulations and economy of a well governed family and of the parts which it became the husband and the  wife to take That was the time in which you ought to have made your objections but then every thing was just every thing was rational and from your ready acquiescence to my proposals and the admiration with which you seemed to receive them I had no doubt of enjoying that serene that delightful state of connubial happiness so often desired and so seldom obtained  On such conditions and with such views I confidently entered with you into a partnership which unhappily cannot be dissolved The irrevocable contract was scarcely ratified before it was violated With a temper habitually gloomy and suspicious and a mind incapable of bending to those inevitable little anxieties and vexations which occur in the most quiet families you soon discovered your propensity to repel every thing that your jealous and fanciful temper deemed an infringement of your privileges  Let your own heart testify how long and how ardently I endeavoured by mildness and the most simple and convincing reasons to bring you back to your duty But in vain causes of disagreement became so frequent and injury succeeded injury so fast that I was obliged to proceed to those gentle severities which are all that a husband who preserves a proper respect for himself can inflict And gentle they certainly were when compared to the contumely by which they were provoked I forbore those tender and endearing epithets by which former affection should be continually revived I then avoided and indeed refused to converse with you except in the company of a third person or as far as necessity obliged me Sorry am I to say that instead of warning you to shun the rocks of mischief my efforts did but aggravate your folly  It is true you had your hours of contrition  in which with tears and prayers and unbounded acknowledgments of the absurdity of your conduct together with solemn assurances of reformation you have for a moment recalled my lost love and made me hope you would acquire some power over the discordant passions that devoured you But these promises were so often repeated and so continually forgotten that at length they afforded neither hope nor ease they had only been gleams of sunshine foreboding that the tempest would soon return with increasing violence Yes partial as I know you and blind to your own errors you cannot deny that at last you approached the fury rather than the woman  To a man like me of a delicate temper quick at discovering errors and eager to redress them even in cases where they do not personally affect myself but indefatigable where they do this eternal discord these quarrels and despicable  brawls are become insupportable I have endured the torture seven miserable years and surely that is no slight trial surely that is sufficient to prove I have not wanted patience or fortitude To be a good husband and a provident father and to protect those that depend on me from injury and want are qualities which I believe the whole world will allow me you alone excepted  You  upbraid me with faults  you  accuse me of crimes  you  proclaim me a tyrant When I am gone when your passions have subsided and when you feel the want of me you will be more just You will then lament that nothing short of this desperate proof could convince you of the criminality of your conduct  Where I shall seek where find or where endure existence or to what hospitable or inhospitable shore I shall wander I know not yet I only know that in England it cannot shall not be We have  lived long enough in misery which everlastingly to avoid seas or death shall everlastingly divide us  W ELFORD  This letter although it contained many marks of that impatience which had increased his family misfortunes could only have been written by a man of virtue whose very austerity had in it a preponderance of benevolent intention Such was my uncle whose memory though but a child I often had occasion to regret  By various plausible pretexts with the hope of forwarding a fortune that was to descend to me Mr Elford had been prevailed on to lend my father several sums of money to the amount of seven hundred pounds My uncle too had found other occasions for the exercise of his humanity His property had been hastily sold and therefore disadvantageously so  that the sum with which he went to seek his fortune on foreign shores was but small He was enough acquainted with my father's affairs to know that of the money lent to him there was little hope  To me he wrote a letter which will sufficiently shew how kind he would have been had he possessed the power It was inclosed in one to my father with directions to suffer me to read it now and that it should be preserved and given to me when age should have matured my undersanding The following were its contents  TO HUGH TREVOR  My dear boy young as you are I have conceived a friendship and affection for you which perhaps inflict as severe a pang at the present moment as any one of the distressing circumstances that occasion my flight Had I wealth to leave  I would endeavour to secure you from the baneful effects of poverty as it is accept all that I have to give my best wishes my dearest love and a little good advice Though your understanding is greatly above your years yet you cannot have experience and knowledge enough of sorrow to conceive what my feelings are but if hereafter you should remember me and if at that most serious moment when you enter on the marriage state you should wish for a friend like me to advise with let this letter supply my place The miseries I have endured by my mistakes on the subject are so strongly imprinted on my mind that I can think of nothing else and inapplicable as it may seem to your present course of thought I cannot persuade myself but that it is the most interesting of all topics upon which I could write to you  Of the wisdom of entering into the marriage state and of the virtue of the  institution I have lately begun to entertain the most serious doubts Whether they are well founded or are the consequences of my own mistakes of conduct I dare not at this moment determine but while the present forms of society exist should you arrive at manhood the probability is that you will marry If then you should ever think of marriage think of it as a duty and not merely as the means of self gratification or the indulgence of some childish and irrational passion which irrational people dignify with the name of love Let the affection you conceive for woman be founded on the qualities of her mind  But above all things first examine yourself whether you can endure opposition without anger and next put the woman you intend to marry to the same test for unless you are mutually unshaken in your resolutions on this head if you marry you are miserable The task of man and wife is reciprocally arduous  She should be mild goodhumoured cheerful and tender he cool rational and vigilant without acrimony devoid of captiousness and free from passion It is mutually their duty to inspect and to expostulate but to be  are how they reprove Where gentleness and equanimity of temper are wanting happiness never can be obtained Believe me my dear boy I have never stood so low in my own opinion as when I have caught myself betrayed into petulance and descending to passion The combats I have maintained to overcome this weakness are inconceivable  Whether it be constitutional in me or habitual I cannot determine Had Mr Elford been more a philosopher he would have known that frequent anger is merely a habitbut I suspect that to this I chiefly owe my present misfortunes as I am half persuaded there is no woman that may not be moulded into what form her husband  pleases provided he possess a superior understanding and an entire command of his temper But Oh how severe the task to preserve a perfect equality in despite of the ill humour caprice or injustice of a woman for whom you undergo a thousand difficulties encounter continual labours and undauntedly expose yourself to every fatigue and dangerI blush to think I have sunk beneath the trialBut we have both gone too far to recede we have mutually said and done what never can be forgotten  As good temper is the basis of connubial felicity means must be taken by which it may be cultivated and preserved From the first hour of marriage beware of too much familiarity and of encouraging or of taking liberties Be as circumspect in your behaviour as if a stranger were present and dread deviating from that respect which is due from man to woman and from woman to man in a single state This does not imply coldness or formality but the cheerful intercourse  of good sense Behave as you would to a person from whom you are happy to receive a visit and with whose company you are delighted Should you indulge those ebullitions of passionate fondness which lose sight of these limits it is impossible to foretell to what they may lead A caress neglected or supposed to be neglected a kiss not returned with the like warmth or a fond pressure not answered with equal ardour may poison a mind which applauds itself for the delicacy of its sensations  Do not expect to find your wife all perfection I know the romance of lovers they read descriptions in which the imagination has been exhausted to depict enamoured youth superior to every terrestrial being and they are convinced that above all others the object of their own particular choice has never yet been equalled Such fanciful and silly people when time and experience have something allayed their ardour will often find their dainty taste offended at discovering a  mole on the bosom or a yellow shade in the neck or any other trifling bodily blemish which was as visible before marriage as after had they looked with the same scrutinizing eyes Be resolute in repelling every emotion of anger or disgust Never permit a choleric or bitter expression to escape you for wedded love is but too often of a tender and perishable nature and such rude potions are its poison  I look back at what I have been writing and am astonished at the subject I have chosen But the torrent of my thoughts is irresistible they hurry me away and persuade me that though young it is yet possible you may hereafter remember me and at a time when perhaps you shall have arrived at the exercise of many of those noble virtues which are now only in the bud I have a great affection for you my dear nephew and should be glad that if you then cannot think kindly you should at least think  justly and that you should possess some faint picture of the present state of my feelings Could you but know all the emotions of my heart you would bear witness to its honesty and would own that its efforts have been strenuous unremitted and sincere though unfortunate  Years pass quickly away yet a little while and you will be an actor in this busy world of which at present your knowledge is small I am doomed never to see you more but while I have life and memory I shall never forget you  W ELFORD  CHAP VIII  MY FATHER BECOMES A BANKRUPT FLIES THE COUNTRY LISTS FOR AN EAST INDIA SOLDIER AND DIES ON SHIPBOARD DISTRESS OF MY MOTHER AND THE BEGINNING OF MY MISFORTUNES I AM BOUND APPRENTICE CHARACTERISTIC TRAITS OF MY MASTER THE DREADFUL SUFFERINGS I UNDERGO AND MY NARROW ESCAPES WITH LIFE  YOUNG as I was I perfectly remember that the strange departure of my uncle Elford produced a very sensible effect upon me It may well be imagined that when my understanding was more mature the perusal of this affectionate letter and the recollection of his kindness to me in my days of childhood excited no little emotion  As for my aunt prepared as she had been for some violent catastrophe to their quarrelling she was either so struck by the letter and the remembrance of past follies or so fearful of the comments and  scrutiny of the neighbourhood that within a month after he was missing she quitted the country and went to reside at the city of **** where in less than a year she died Her departure was private and the place of her retreat was not known till her last illness when intelligence was sent to the rector to whom she bequeathed such property as she possessed  The absence of my uncle contributed to hasten the approach of that cloudy reverse at which I have already hinted For some time the ruin of my father's affairs had been prevented by the sums which his eloquence had wrung from the wellmeaning Mr Elford Hugh was no contemptible orator on these occasions Hope seldom forsook him and he built so securely on what he hoped might come to pass as sometimes to assert the thing had already happened Such convenient mistakes are daily made If indeed the good graces of fortune would but  have kept pace with his expectations England would not have afforded a more flourishing or gallant yeoman But like monopolizers in general he was apt to speculate a little too deeply Eager to enjoy he was impatient to obtain the means of enjoyment So that at one time the turning up of the jack at all fours was to make his fortune but how provoking it happened to be the ten at another it depended on a duckwing cock which who could have foreseen so strange an accident disgraced the best feeder in the kingdom by running away and it more than once did not want half a neck's length of being realized by a favourite horse yet was lost contrary to the most accurate calculations which as the learned in these matters affirm had been made from Wheatherby's Racing Calendar  Thus to repeated disappointments in his bets and his bargains and to his neglect of his farming affairs it was owing that  in anno dominiwhen I was nine years and a half old after having expended the property with which he had been supplied and incurred debts to the amount of little less than a thousand pounds my father found it prudent to depart by night in the basket of the stage coach for London And prudent it certainly was for his effects had not only been seized in execution of a bond and judgment but the bailiffs from all quarters were at his heels  My mother at this time was pregnant the sister I have mentioned was dead but I had a fine healthy brother about three years old and it was agreed that we should follow to the great city as soon as he had found employment which according to his notions was the most easy thing imaginable  It so happened however that he had not been there a full month before the trifling sum he and my mother had collected for his immediate existence was  lost by the turn of a die contrary to his certain conviction that he had discovered at a hazard table the ready way to repair all past mistakes  To send for wife and children was now out of the question Destitute of support without the means of obtaining another shilling after fasting a day and a half his courage that is his appetite could hold out no longer and he enlisted for an EastIndia soldier having first convinced himself by the soundest arguments that he should immediately be made a serjeant which perhaps was no improbable calculation that he should then soon get a commission and that he should undoubtedly return a commanding officer or general in chief to the surprise of his friends and the utter confusion of the rector and all those whom he accounted his persecutors  That these great events might not actually have happened who shall pretend to say Miracles of old were plentiful  and even in these unbelieving days strange things have come to pass But all his unbounded hopes many of which he had stated in his last letter to my mother were unexpectedly subverted by an accident to which it appears men in general are subject He caught a fever while the ship in which he was to be a passenger lay waiting in the Downs for a wind and in spite of the surgeon and his whole chest of medicines died of all which events there was a circumstantial account transmitted by one of his comrades to my mother  The ruin of prospects so fair the desolation of a house and homeless woman with two orphan children and pregnant of a third and the loss of a husband who at the worst of times had always kept hope alive were sufficient causes of affliction to my mother Tears were plentifully shed and daily and nightly wailings were indulged  Every resource was soon exhausted  and immediate relief became necessary To whom could she apply To whom but the rector She wrote to him in terms the most moving the most humiliating and indeed the most abject that her imagination could suggest But in vain no prayers no tears no terrors of this world or of the next could move him The father and the divine were equally inexorable He pleaded his oath but he remembered his revenge After the first letter he would receive no more and when she wrote again and again with the direction in a different hand and using other little stratagems he returned no answer  From this extreme distress and from the intolerable disgrace as my mother supposed it to be of coming on the parish we were relieved to the best of her ability by a poor widow woman with four children who had formerly lived a servant in the Trevor family and who after her husband's death maintained herself and her orphans with incredible industry  and with no other aid but the produce of a cow that she fed chiefly on the common where her cottage stood The active good sense with which she did every thing that was entrusted to her was the cause that she never wanted employment and she exerted her utmost attention to make her children as they grew up as useful as herself  By this woman's advice and aid my mother applied herself to spinning and it was agreed that I should either drive the plough or be put apprentice as soon as I could find a master  For my own part all my sources of pleasure and improvement were at once retrenched That I had not horses to ride a father to play with and caress me and a kind uncle to instruct and delight me were among the least of my misfortunes Reading that great field of enjoyment which was daily opening more amply upon me was totally cut off My curiosity had been awakened my memory praised and my acuteness  admired in an instant as it were all these joys were vanished  Previous to my uncle's departure I had found another mode of obtaining knowledge and applause He was musical and a few persons of the like turn scattered through the neighbouring hamlets used occasionally to meet at his house where they exercised themselves in singing from the works of Croft Green Boyce Purcel Handel and such authors as they possessed One of them played the bassoon another the flute and a third the violin I had a quick ear was attracted by their harmony and began to join in their concerts A treble voice was a great acquisition I was apt and they encouraged me by frequent praise and admiration My uncle gave me Arnold's Psalmody in which I eagerly studied the rudiments of the science but this book with the rest was swept away in the general wreck and I after having had a glimpse of the enchanted land of knowledge  was cast back apparently to perish in the gloomy deserts of ignorance I had no source of information except my mother and her stores at the best were scanty at present labour left her but little leisure and the little she had was spent in complaint  The poor widow indeed willingly did me every kindness in her power but that alas was small With this honest hearted creature I remained eight months going out to a day's work whenever I could get one to weed drive the plough set potatoes or any thing else that they would put me to till at last a farmer finding me expert agreed to take me as an apprentice on condition that I should serve him till I was one and twenty The offer was joyfully accepted by my mother and I had spirit and understanding enough to be happy that I could thus provide for myself  I had soon reason to repent my master was the most passionate madman I  ever beheld and when in a passion the most mischievous His cattle his horses his servants his wife his children were each of them in turn the objects of his fury  The accidents that happened from his ungovernable choler were continual and his cruelty when in these fits was incredible though at other times strange to tell he was remarkably compassionate He one day beat out the eye of a calf because it would not instantly take the milk he offered Another time he pursued a goose that ran away from him when he flung it oats and was so enraged by the efforts it made to escape that he first tore off its wing and then twisted its neck round On a third occasion he bit off a pig's ear because it struggled and cried while he was ringing it One of his children was lamed and though nobody knew how it happened every body gave him credit for the accident Yet he had his paroxysms of fondness for his children and  for the lame boy in particular Indeed it was generally remarked that he was the most cruel to those for whom he had the greatest affection The perception of his own absurdity did but increase his rage till it was exhausted after which he has sometimes been seen to burst into tears at the recollection of his own madness and inhumanity  One habit arising from his excessive vivacity was that when he wanted any thing done he expected the person nearest to him should not only instantly obey but conceive what he meant from the pointing of his finger the turn of his head or the motion of his eye without speaking a word while the dread of his anger stupified and rendered the person against whom it was directed motionless  I continued for an unexampled length of time to be his favourite The family remarked at first with surprise and afterward either with a sense of injustice or of enmity the restraint he put upon himself  and the great partiality with which he treated me My superior quickness excited his admiration he held me up as an example and laid the flattering unction to his soul that he was no tyrant on the contrary when people had but common sense nobody was more kind  But old habits though they may suffer a temporary disguise are devils incarnate The tide of passion at length broke loose and with redoubled violence for having suffered constraint To add to the misfortune my thirst after knowledge was the cause or at least the pretext of this change It happened that an old book of arithmetic fell in my way and as this was at that time the sole treasure of instruction within my reach I made it my constant companion carried it in my bosom and pored over it whenever I could steal a moment to myself In the heinous act of reading this book I was twice detected by my moody master The first time he cautioned  me with fire in his eyes never to let him catch me idling my time in that manner again and the second he snatched hold of my ear and gave me so sudden and violent a pull that he brought me to the ground He did worse he took away my book and locked it up  Hostilities having thus commenced they soon grew hot and were pursued with bitterness tyranny and malignity Proceeding from bad to worse after a while every thing I did was wrong In proportion as his frenzy became hateful or rather terrible to his own imagination his cruelty increased He seemed in my instance to have the dread upon him of committing some injury so violent as perhaps to bring him to the gallows and several times in his chafing fits declared his fear  This idea haunted him so much that he adopted a new mode of conduct with me and instead of kicking me knocking me down or hurling the first thing that  came to hand at me gave himself time enough to take the horsewhip Yet he could not always be thus cautious and even when he was such infernal discipline though less dangerous was more intolerable  The scenes I went through with this man the sufferings I endured and the stupifying terrors that seized me if I saw but his shadow I can never forget Every thing I did was a motive for chastisement one day it was for having turned the horses out to graze and the very next for suffering them to stand in the stable The cattle of his neighbour for whom he had a mortal enmity broke into his field during the night and for this I was most unmercifully flogged the next morning The pretence was my not having told him that the fence was defective Rainy weather made him fret and then I was sure of a beating If it were fine he was all hurry anxiety and impatience and to escape the wicked itching of his fingers was impossible  One effect that he produced might be thought remarkable had we not the history of Sparta in its favour and did we not occasionally observe the like in other boys under tyrannical treatment The efforts I was obliged to make to endure the terrible punishment he inflicted and live at last rendered me to a certain degree insensible of pain They were powerfully aided indeed by the indignant detestation which I felt and by the something like defiance with which it enabled me to treat him  This on one occasion exasperated him so much that seeing me support the lash without a tear and as if disdaining complaint he franticly snatched up a pitchfork drove it at me and I luckily avoiding it struck the prongs into the barndoor with the exclamation "damn your soul I'll make you feel me" The moment after he was seized with a sense of his own lunacy turned as pale as death and stood aghast with  horror My supposed crime was that I had eaten some milk the last of which I myself had seen the dog lap Perceiving the terror of his mind I took courage and told him "Jowler eat the milk I saw him just as he had done I would not tell you because I knew if I had you would have hanged the poor dog" This short sentence had such an effect upon him that he dropped on his knees the tears rolling from his eyes and cried out in an undescribable agony "Lord have mercy upon my sinful soul I shall surely come to be hanged"  The terror of this lesson remained longer than those who knew him would have expected but it insensibly wore away  The efforts I made in the interval to conciliate and avoid wakening the fiend were strenuous but ineffectual I shrunk from no labour and the business with which he intrusted me shewed the confidence he placed in my activity and intelligence  At eleven years old I drove the loaded team to market or elsewhere without a superintendant I was sent in every direction across the country to bring home sheep deliver calves to the butcher fetch cattle cart coals or any thing else within my strength  Various were the distresses in which these duties and the distempered choler of my master involved me On one occasion a wicked boy set his dog at my sheep and drove them into a turnip field out of which I could not get them but with great difficulty and loss of time of which my master demanded a severe account A calf once broke from me and foolishly tumbled into a waterpit from which I delivered it at the hazard of my life Another time when the roads were heavy my waggon was set fast in a clay rut where I was detained above an hour two drivers refusing to give me a pull because they had both lived with my malicious master  and a third being only prevailed on for this master of mine was generally hated by my prayers and tears and the picture I drew of my own distress  At length the violence of his temper recovered its full elasticity which was a second time chiefly excited by my earnest longing after knowledge Notwithstanding that my book was taken from me my mind was often occupied with the arithmetic I had learned in better days which had been strongly revived by its contents At the employment this afforded me I was twice caught by my master once multiplying and dividing with a nail against the paling and the second time extracting the square root with chalk on the wall  These misdemeanours were aggravated by another incident I one morning happened to find by good luck as I thought a halfcrown piece that was lying on the high road The moment I was possessed of this treasure I began to consider  how it ought to be expended I was in great want of shoes stockings and other things but with those my master was bound to provide me and if I attempted to supply myself the probability was that he would beat me for not having given him the money  After pondering again and again on the necessaries I might obtain the luxuries in which I might indulge and what was infinitely more tempting the stores of learning with which such a sum would furnish me the recollection of my mother brother and sister for so the young one proved to be and their distress with that of the benevolent poor creature who afforded them a shelter seized me so strongly that I thought it would be wicked not to send my halfcrown where it was so much wanted But how to convey it thither That was the difficulty I had no means no messenger no soul in whom I durst confide I therefore resolved for the present to conceal  it by pinning it in the lining of my waistcoat and this was one of those unforeseen events that are generally called lucky chances  My master's devil was again let loose and a most uncontrolable devil he was I had overslept myself a very uncommon accident with me and had put him into one of his hateful humours At breakfast while eating his bread and cheese I was set to watch the milk that stood on the fire to boil By some accident I forgot my office he saw it rise in the pipkin looked toward me could not catch my eye and seized with one of his unaccountably hellish fits sprang forward just as the milk began to boil over and struck at me with a clasped knife that he held in his hand  Fortunately for me the point found resistance by the saving intervention of my halfcrown The clasp gave way with the violence of the blow and shutting made a deep gash in his own hand  Again he turned pale and as the blood smeared the floor knew not I believe whether it was mine or his own My dame trembling called out "Are you hurt Hugh" for she too saw the blood and knew not whose it was I answered "No" but with a tremulous voice being in dread of more blows They soon descended upon me after he had discovered his mistake and it was with difficulty that I escaped being thrown behind the fire  This was not the end of the history of my halfcrown I kept it above three months till I happened to be sent to the market town with a load of hay Here in passing through the street my eye as usual was attracted by the bookseller's window I had not forgotten how rich I was and could not resist I went in examined some of the stores the shop contained and with great difficulty restrained myself to the purchase of the Seven Champions of Christendom which  cost me a shilling The other eighteen pence I found an opportunity it being market day of sending by a neighbour to my mother with an injunction that sixpence of it should be given to her poor hostess  With what eagerness I read the valiant deeds of these valiant knights as I rode home in my empty cart I will leave the reader to divine but he will probably pity me when I inform him that I was so deeply engaged in my book as not to perceive the arrival of the cart at my master's yard gate and that he himself stood at the barn door contemplating me in the profound negligence of my studies  Riding in the cart neglecting the team having a new book and reading in it formed a catalogue of crimes too black to hope for pardon Not the horse but the cart whip was the instrument of vengeance and after having tired himself and left weals of a finger's breadth  on my body arms legs and thighs he completed his malice this time not by locking up but by burning my book  I had already lived a year and a half under the tortures of this demon till they became so intolerable that at last I determined to run away I was confirmed in this resolution by another dangerous incident which terrified me more even than any of the preceding and convinced me that if I stayed any longer with this villainous savage I could not escape death  I was one day driving the plough for him when a young horse not half broken in was the second in the team I used my utmost endeavours but could not manage him and the lunatic my master who was as strong as he was ferocious caught up a stone and aimed it at the colt at least so from his manner at the moment I supposed but struck me with it and knocked me down immediately in the furrow where the plough was  coming I saw the ploughshare that in an instant was to cut me in two but the madman with an incredible effort started it out of the earth and flung it fairly over me Unable however to recover his balance he trod upon my forehead with his hobnailed shoe and cut a deep gash just over my eye and another in my skull whether with the same foot or in what manner I do not know My eye was presently closed up and my hair steeped in the blood that flowed plentifully from both wounds  There I lay stunned for a moment while he was obliged to attend to the frightened colt which forced the other horses to run and was become wholly unmanageable When I recovered I heard him holloa and saw him struggling with the horses at the farther end of the field but the impression of the danger I had just escaped was so strong that my resolution of running away came upon me with irresistible force and perceiving  him so thoroughly engaged I immediately put it in execution  I imagine it was some time before he missed me and he then probably conjectured I was gone home Be it as it will I used my legs without molestation and committing myself to chance and the wide world made the best of my way  CHAP IX  MY FLIGHT DESPONDING THOUGHTS ADVENTURE WITH A STRANGER ON THE ROAD I AM PROMISED RELIEF BUT LEARN A FEARFUL SECRET THAT AGAIN PLUNGES ME IN DOUBT AND ANXIETY I REVEAL MYSELF TO A NEAR RELATION THE STRUGGLES OF PASSION  THE animation that fear gave me was so great that though I felt my shirt collar drenched in the blood that flowed from my wounds I continued to run for at least four miles and though my  pace at length slackened into a walk I still hurried eagerly forward The dread of again falling into his power after an attempt so audacious as this deprived me of any other sense of pain afforded me strength and made me forget the completely desolate state to which I had reduced myself I had no money no food no friend in the world I durst not return to my mother she was the first person of whom the tyrant would enquire after me To avoid him was the only plan I yet thought of and thus impelled I pursued my road  So long as I was acquainted with the country through which I travelled I went on without hesitation but as soon as I found myself entirely beyond my knowledge I began to look about me The questionsWhere am I Whither am I going What am I to doinspired a succession of rising fears which the joy of my deliverance could scarcely counterbalance I regretted the rash haste  with which I had parted with my halfcrown I had not a farthing on earth I had nothing to sell nothing to eat no soul to give me a morsel It was noon when I fled from the ploughed field I had been hard at work from three o'clock in the morning had since travelled at least twelve or fourteen miles wounded as I was and began to feel myself excessively weary stiff and craving after food Where I had got the notion whether from father mother aunt or uncle I know not but I had been taught that to beg was an indelible disgrace and to steal every body had told me was the road to Tyburn Starve or hang that is the law If I even asked for work who wanted my service Who would give me any Who would not enquire where I came from and to whom I belonged  These and many more tormenting ideas were forced upon me by the situation in which I found myself till at last I was  so overcome with fears and fatigue that I sat down to debate whether it were not best or rather whether I should not be absolutely forced to turn back  Still however when I came to reflect on the sufferings I had endured the dangers I had escaped and the horrible punishment that awaited me if I returned any expedient seemed better than that terrific project The distance too exhausted as I thought myself was an additional fear and for a moment I doubted whether I should not lie down and die  Young minds hold death in peculiar horror and the very thought inspired returning energy Among my cogitations I had not forgotten the rector he was obdurate hard hearted and even cruel But was he so cruel as the fiend from whom I had escaped From a latent and undefined kind of feeling I had made toward that side of the country where his village lay and was as I supposed within  four or five miles of it The resolution of making an effort to gain his protection came upon me and I rose with some alacrity to put it in practice He kept horses a coachman and a stableboy he had a garden he farmed a little for his amusement In any of these capacities I could be useful and if he would but give me bread I would do whatever he would put me to He could not surely be so stony hearted as to refuse I was inexperienced and knew not the force of rancour  I pursued my way ruminating on these hopes fears and disasters toward a village that I saw at a distance where I intended to inquire the road I meant to take Descending a hill I came to a bridge over a rivulet of some depth with a carriage way through the water  Just as I had passed it I met a postchariot that drove into the stream I was walking forward with my face toward the village till I suddenly heard a  cry of distress and looking behind me saw the carriage overturned in the water I ran with all speed back to the brook the body of the carriage was almost covered the horses were both down and the postillion entangled between them called aloud for help or his master would be drowned I plunged into the water without fear having as I have elsewhere noticed long ago learned to swim Perceiving the extreme danger of the person in the carriage I struck directly toward the door which I opened and relieved him or confined as he was he must have been almost instantly suffocated His terror was exceedingly great and as soon as he was fairly on his feet he exclaimed with prodigious eagerness "God for ever bless you my good boy you have saved my life"The pallidness of his countenance expressed very strongly the danger of perishing in which he had felt himself  We then both waded out of the water  he sat down on the side of the bridge and I called to some men in a neighbouring field to come and help the postillion I then returned to the gentleman who was shivering as if in an ague fit I asked if I should run and get him help for he seemed very ill "You are a compassionate brave little fellow" said he and looking more earnestly at me exclaimed "I hope you are not hurt how came you so bloody" I knew not what to say and returned no answer "You do not speak child" said he "Let me go and get you some help Sir" replied I"Nay nay but are you hurt ""Not more than I was before this accident""Where do you come from" I was silent"Who are you""A poor friendless boy""Have you not a father""No""A mother" "Yes but she is forsaken by her father and cannot get bread for herself ""How came you in this condition" "My master knocked me down and  trod on me""Knocked you down and trod on you""Yes he was very cruel to me""Cruel indeed Did he often treat you ill""I do not know what other poor boys suffer but he was so passionate that I was never safe" "And you have run away from him" "I was afraid he would murder me" "Poor creature Your eye is black your forehead cut and your hair quite clotted with blood""I have a bad gash in my head but I can bear it You shake worse and worse let me go and get you some help the village is not far off" "I feel I am not well""Shall I call one of the men""Do my good fellow"  I ran and the men came they had set the carriage on its wheels but it was entirely wet and not fit to ride in The gentleman therefore leaned on one of them walked slowly back to the village and desired me to follow I gladly obeyed the order He had pitied me I had saved his life  if I could not make a friend I was in danger of starving and I began to hope that I had now found one  The best accommodations that the only inn in the village afforded were quickly procured At first the gentleman ordered a postchaise to return home but he soon felt himself so ill that he desired a bed might be got ready and in the mean time sent to the nearest medical man both for himself and to examine my wounds What was still better he ordered the people of the house to give me whatever I chose to eat and drink and told them he had certainly been a dead man at that moment if it had not been for me But he would not forget me he would take care of me as long as he lived  This was joyful news indeed or rather something much more exquisite than joyful My heart melted when I heard him I burst into tears and replied "I would willingly die to serve him"  He then went to bed and as evening came  on the fever with which he was attacked increased The anxiety I felt was excessive and I was so earnest in my intreaties to sit and watch by him that he was prevailed on to grant my request From what I can now recollect I imagine the apothecary gave him the common remedy Dr James's powders When the medicine no longer operated he fell into a sound sleep about eleven o'clock and when he awoke the next morning found himself much refreshed and free from fever  In the interim my wounds had been dressed and to make the truth of my story evident I took care to shew the bruises and black and blue marks with which my body was plentifully covered Every favourable circumstance every precaution every effort was now indeed become necessary for late in the evening I accidentally learned a secret of the most important and hopeinspiring yet alarming nature My all was at stake my  very existence seemed to depend on the person who it is true had promised to be my protector but who perhaps when he should hear who I was might again become my persecutor The man to whom I had attached myself whose life I had saved and who had avowed a sense of the obligation was no other than my grandfather  The moment I heard this terrific intelligence it chilled and animated me alternately and as soon as I could recollect myself I determined not to quit his apartment all night No persuasions could prevail on me and when the chambermaid who sat up with him attempted to use force I was so violent in my resistance that she desisted and suffered me to remain in quiet  When he awoke in the morning I trembled at the sound of his voice I remembered the oath he had sworn which my mother had often affirmed he would never break He was totally changed  in my idea from the gentleman whose life I had saved the day before There had not indeed been any thing particularly winning in his aspect but then there was a strong sense of danger and of obligation to the instrument of his escape who interested him something the more by being unfortunate But an oath solemnly taken by a man of so sacred a character The thought was dreadful  His curtains were drawn and my trepidation increased "What my good boy" said he "are you up and here already" "He has never been in bed" answered the chambermaid "We could not get him out of the room" I replied in a faint voice such as my fears inspired "I hoped he was better" "Yes yes" said he "I have had a good sleep and feel as if I wanted my breakfast go my girl and let it be got ready"  The chambermaid obeyed his orders and he continued"Why did not you  go to bed child""It did not become me to leave you""How so" "I hope I know my duty better""Your duty" "Yes Sir""You seem to be an extraordinary boy you act with great spirit and talk with more good sense than I should expect from your poverty and education""So I ought to do Sir though I am desolate I have been brought up better than most poor boys" "Ay indeed"  The apothecary entered and after having paid all necessary attention to his patient informed him of the state in which he had found me talked of my wounds and bruises and the cruelty of the man that could inflict them repeated several of the anecdotes of his tyranny which I had told him and concluded with remarks on my good fortune in having found so kind a protector  "The boy has saved my life" said my grandfather "and he shall not want a friend" "Are you quite sure of that  Sir" answered I with emphatical anxiety "Never while I live" replied the rector "Nay but are you quite quite positive" "Do you doubt my word boy" "That is very wrong of you indeed child" said the apothecaryA thought suddenly struck me If he would but take an oath said I to myself The oath the oath that was what I dreaded An opposite oath seemed to be my only safeguard I continued"I swear Sir while I have life never to forsake you but to be dutiful and true to you" "Swear boy""Yes Sir most solemnly"I spoke with great fervor "You are an unaccountable boy" "Oh that  you  would never forsake  me"  "I tell you I will not""Oh that you never would""Won't you believe me""Oh that you never never would""The boy I believe wants me to swear too""Ay do Sir take an oath not to disown me and indeed indeed I'll die willingly to deserve your favour" "Disown you""Nay Sir but take an  oath You say I saved your life I would lay down my own again and again to save it Do not deny me do not turn me to starve or send me back to be murdered by my barbarous master""I tell you I will not""Nay but""Well then I swear boy I will not""Do you indeed duly and truly swear""Solemnly boy I take heaven to witness that if you are not guilty of something very wicked while I live I will provide for you"I fell on my knees caught hold of his hand burst into tears and exclaimed with sobs "God in heaven bless my dear clear good grandfather He has forgiven me He has forgiven me" "Grandfather" "I am Hugh Trevor"  Never did I behold so sudden a change in the human countenance The rector's eyes glared at me There was something ghastly in the sunken form of his features My shirt was still red and my coat spotted with blood the hair had been cut away from the wound on my head which was covered with a large  plaister My eye was black and swelled up and my forehead too was plaistered above the eyebrow My body he had been told was covered with bruises tears bathed my cheeks and my face was agitated with something like convulsive emotions This strange figure was suddenly changed into his grandson it was an apparition he knew not how to endure To be claimed by such a wretched creature to have been himself the author of his wretchedness to have had an oath extorted from him in direct violation of an opposite oath to feel this universal shock to his pride and his prejudices was a complication of jarring sensations that confounded him To resist was an effort beyond his strength For a moment he lost his voice at last he exclaimed with a hoarse scream"Take him away"My heart sunk within me The apothecary stood petrified with astonishment The rector again repeated with increasing  agony"Take him away Begone Never let me see him more"  The pang I felt was unutterable I rose with a feeling of despair that was annihilating and was going broken hearted out of the room At that instant the figure of my master started to recollection and with such terror as to subdue every other fear I turned back fell on my knees again and clasping my hands cried out "For God Almighty's sake do not send me back to my master I shall never escape with life He will murder me He will murder me I'll be your servant as long as I live I will go of your errands take care of your horses drive your plough weed your garden do any thing you bid me indeed indeed I willDo not send me back to be murdered"  The excess of my feelings had something of a calming effect on those of the rector He repeated "Go go boy go I feel myself very ill" The apothecary  recovered his tongue and added "Ay my good child you had better go"  The altered voice of the rector removed a part of the load that oppressed me and I left the room though with no little sensation of despondency In about half an hour the apothecary came down He had had a conversation with the rector who I found could not endure the sight of me again under my present forlorn or rather accusing form The remembrance however that I had saved his life was predominant How his casuistry settled the account between his two oaths I never heard on that subject he was eternally silent He was probably ashamed of having taken the first and of having been tricked out of the second His orders were that I should go home with the apothecary with whom he had arranged matters should be new clothed wait till my  wounds were healed and then if he possibly could he would prevail upon himself to see me  CHAP X  HOPES IN BEHALF OF MY MOTHER THE ARRIVAL OF THE HECTOR I GAIN HIS FAVOUR AM ADOPTED BY HIM AND EFFECT A FAMILY RECONCILIATION ANECDOTES OF A SCHOOLFELLOW AND HIS SISTER GRAMMATICAL AND MUSICAL STUDIES CAUSES OF DISCONTENT BETWEEN THE SQUIRE AND THE RECTOR TYTHES AND LAW PRODUCE QUARRELS THE TRAGICOMIC TALE OF THE RATS  SIX weeks had elapsed before my wounds bruises and black marks had totally disappeared and the scar above my eye still retained a red appearance The alteration of my person however aided as it was by dress was so remarkable as to excite surprise among my village friends The apothecary prided himself upon the  change persuading himself that the rector would thank him for the present of so fine a grandson His art and care had wrought miracles I was quite another creature the alteration was so prodigious since he had taken me that he was sure there was not so fine a boy in all England  In the mean time I had written to my mother whose cottage was about ten miles across the country from the village where the apothecary lived He would not permit me to go to her it might offend the rector but he agreed that if she should by chance come to me there could be no harm in my speaking to my mother He too understood casuistry She accordingly came to see me and was overjoyed at what had happened it might lead to a general reconciliation especially now that my brother and sister were both dead They had been carried off by the smallpox and she rightly enough conjectured that  the rector would not be the less prone to pardon her for being clear of further incumbrance She enjoined me to intercede in her behalf and I very sincerely promised to speak as soon as I dared  The day at last came on which the rector was to pay his visit and examine how far I was fit to be his grandson My terror by this time had considerably abated he having taken thus much notice of me I scarcely could believe myself in danger of being rejected I was not however without trepidation and when the well known post chariot drove up to the door my heart sunk within me  The apothecary had two sons one a year older and the other some months younger than I was The eldest was deformed and his brother squinted abominably Curiosity had brought them and the whole family into the parlour to be spectators of the interview My grandfather entered I was dressed as genteelly as every effort of the village  taylor could contrive an appearance so different from that of the beaten bruised and wounded poor elf he first had seen with clouted shoes torn stockings and coarse coating dripping with water and clotted with blood was so great as scarcely to be credible The ugliness of my companions did but enhance the superiority of my look he could not be mistaken in which was his grandson and the pleasure my preeminence inspired excited a smile of no little approbation For my part I had conceived an affection for him first I had saved his life then he had relieved me from distress and now was come to own me as his grandson The change of my present situation from that in which I had endured so much misery gave me ineffable pleasure The entrance of the rector who had been the cause of this change and the smile with which he regarded me went to my heart I kneeled my eyes flowing in tears and begged his blessing  He gave it bade me rise and thus made me one of the happiest creatures existing  The rector stayed some time to settle accounts with the apothecary after which the postillion was called leave was taken and I found myself seated beside my grandfather in that fortunate post chariot from which I had so happily extricated him  How extreme are the vicissitudes of life What a reverse of fortune was here From hard fare severe labour and a brutal tyrant to plenty ease and smiling felicity No longer chained in poverty and ignorance I now had free access to the precious mines of knowledge Far from being restrained I had every encouragement to pursue inquiry and the happiness of the change was at first so great as almost to be incredible But the youthful mind easily acquires new habits and my character varied with the accidents by which it was influenced Yet  to use my father's language the casehardening I had received tempered my future life and prepared me to endure those misfortunes with fortitude which might otherwise have broken my spirit  From the day that I arrived at the rectory I increased so fast in my grandfather's favour that he scarcely knew how to deny me a request I was soon bold enough to petition for my mother and though the pill at first was bitter my repeated importunities at length prevailed and the rector agreed that when his daughter should have sufficiently humbled herself in terms suited to his dignity and her degradation she should be permitted to kneel at his footstool for pardon instead of perishing like an outcast as she deserved  It was not to be expected that my mother should object to the conditions the alternative was very simple submit or  starve Beside she had been too much accustomed to the display of the collective authority accumulated in the person of the rector to think of contest His government was patriarchal and his powers plenipotentiary He was the head of his family the priest of the parish the justice of peace for the hundred and the greatest man of miles around He had no rival except the beforementioned Squire Mowbray whom if divines can hate I certainly think he hated  Of the claims of my late master over me as his apprentice I never heard more Perhaps there was no indenture for I do not recollect to have signed one but if there were he certainly was too conscious of his guilt to dare to enforce his right now that he found me acknowledged and protected by a man so powerful as my grandfather It is possible indeed that he should never have heard what became of me though I consider that as very improbable While I was at Oxford I  was informed that he died raving with a fever in the brain  I have mentioned the encouragement I received to pursue inquiry one of the first things the rector thought of was my education Now that he had owned I was indeed his grandson it was fitting that his grandson should be a gentleman In the parish committed to his pastoral guidance was a grammar school that had been endowed not indeed by Squire Mowbray or his ancestors but by the family that in times of yore had held the same estate The pious founder had vested the government not entirely in his own family and its representatives but in that family and the rector for the time being This circumstance and many others of a parochial nature conduced to a kind of partition of power well calculated to excite contempt in the wealthy Squire who was likewise lord of the manor and inflame jealousy in heaven's holy vicegerent whose very office on earth  is to govern and to detect reprove and rectify the wanderings of us silly sheep  To this school I was immediately sent and here among other competitors was the Squire's eldest son Hector Mowbray He was two years older than I and in the high exercise of that power to which he was the redoubted heir To insult the boys seize their marbles split their tops cuff them if they muttered kick them if they complained to the master get them flogged if they kicked and cuffed in return and tyrannize over them to the very stretch of his invention were practices in which he daily made himself more and more expert He was the young Squire and that was a receipt in full for all demands  I soon came to understand that he was the son of a great man a very great man indeed and that there was a prodigious difference between flesh and blood of a squire's propagating and that of ordinary  breed But I heard it so often repeated and saw it proved in such a variety of instances that I too was the grandson of a great man ay so great as openly to declare war against or at least bid defiance to the giant power of Magog Mowbray it was an epithet of my grandfather's giving I say I was so fully convinced that I myself was the son of somebody pshaw I mean the grandson that no sooner did young Hector begin to exercise his ingenuity upon me than I found myself exceedingly disposed to rebel I had been bred in a hardy school  At my first admission into this seminary I did not immediately and fully enter into the spirit and practice of the place though I soon became tolerably active At robbing orchards tying up latches lifting gates breaking down hedges and driving cattle astray I was by no means so great a proficient as Hector nor had I  any great affection for swimming hedgehogs hunting cats or setting dogs at boys and beggars but at climbing trees running leaping swimming and such like exercises I was among the most alert  My courage too was soon put to the proof and my opponents found that I entered on action with very tolerable alacrity so that not to mention sparrings and skirmishes from which having begun I was never the first to flinch I had not been a year at school before I had been declared the conqueror in three set battles The third was with a butcher's boy in defence of Hector who for once instead of giving had suffered insult but who though older and stronger than I was had not the courage to attack his hardy antagonist My victory was dearly earned for the boy was considerably my superior in age and strength and bred to the sport But this defence of  him and the fear of having me for a foe induced Hector to court my favour and often to invite me to Mowbray Hall  Nor did the whole of my fame end here the first day I entered the school I was allowed to be the best English scholar excepting one Turl a youth noted for his talents and who while he remained there continually kept his place in every class as head boy But this was no triumph over me for beside having been so long at school he had three or four years the advantage of me in point of age Neither did my thirst of inquiry abate and I had now not only books but instructors on the contrary my eagerness increased and my progress both in Latin and Greek was rapid The rector was astonished at it and was often embarrassed by the questions which my desire of learning impelled me to put  Among my other acquirements I became a practical musician The rector could strum the bass tolerably and his  friend the lawyer could play the violin in which however he was excelled by the clerk of the parish I retained some remembrance of what I had formerly studied and felt a great desire to learn the rector encouraged it and as the clerk is always the very humble servant and slave of the parson he was inducted my music master I loved the art so that in less than twelve months I had made a sufficient progress to join in Corelli's and even Handel's trios and thus to strengthen the parsonagehouse band  People who hate each other do yet visit and keep up an intercourse according to set forms purposely to conceal their hatred it being a hideous and degrading vice of which all men are more or less either ashamed or afraid To preserve these appearances or perhaps from the impulse of vanity the rector admitted of my excursions to Mowbray Hall For my own part I found a motive more alluring than the society of Hector that  frequently occasioned me to repeat these vists His sister Olivia two years younger than myself was usually one of our parlour playmates Born of the same mother living in the same family accustomed to the same manners it is difficult to account for the very opposite propensities of this brother and sister Every thing the reverse of what has been recited of Hector was visible in Olivia He was boisterous selfish and brutal she was compassionate generous and gentle his faculties were sluggish obtuse and confined hers were acute discriminating and capacious his want of feeling made him delight to inflict torture her extreme sensibility made her fly to administer relief The company of Olivia soon became very attractive and the rambles that I have sometimes taken with her hand in hand over Mowbray Park afforded no common delight She too was a musician and already famous for her fine voice and execution on the harpsichord  I accompanied her on the violin and sang duets with her so as to surprize and even charm the Squire and throw the visitors at Mowbray Hall into raptures  This sweet intercourse however was terminated by the bickerings backbitings and smothered jealousies between the Squire and my grandfather which at length burst into a slame The Squire had succeeded to his estate and manor by the death of a very distant relation and by this relation the rector had been presented to his living he therefore considered himself as under no kind of obligation to the Squire while the latter on the contrary the advowson being parcel and part of the manor held the manor and himself as owner of the manor to be the actual donor  To all this was added another very serious cause of discontent that of tythes a cause that disturbs half the villages in the kingdom and that frequently exhibits  the man who is sent to preach peace and afford an example of mild forbearance and christian humility as a litigious quarrelsome and odious tyrant much better qualified to herd with wolves than to be the shepherd of his meek master It is sufficiently certain that neither Christ nor his apostles ever took tythes and the esquires farmers and landholders of this christian kingdom would in general be better satisfied if their successors were to follow so disinterested and laudable an example  My grandfather had accepted his rectory at the same commutation that the former incumbent had enjoyed it and while the patron to whom he owed the presentation was living he contented himself with his bargain as well as he could but soon after the accession of Squire Mowbray considering that tie as no longer a clog to his conscience he began to inquire very seriously into the real value of his first fruits and tythes  personal predial and mixed that is his great tythes and his small The calculation inflamed his avarice and he purchased and read all the books on the subject of tythes he could collect Being fond of power and having discovered as he supposed that the man who knows the most quirks in law has the greatest quantity of power over his simple and ignorant neighbours he was a tolerably laborious and successful student of these quirks I say tolerably for it seldom happens that the rector is the most industrious person in the parish  It was thus that after having made the whole hundred tremble at his authority in the exercise of his office of justice of the peace he next hoped to conquer the Behemoth Magog Mowbray himself His own fears of being vanquished and the advice of his friends had indeed for years prevented him from proceeding to an open rupture with his parish and the Squire at its head but  his irritability had been gradually increasing ever since the departure of my uncle Elford The progress of his avarice at first was slow but it gained strength as it proceeded and there was now no one whose opinion had sufficient weight with him to keep it longer quiet His friend the lawyer it is true might have had some such influence over him but the lawyer had been duly articled to the most famous that is the most litigious attorney in the country and was himself his very famous successor a practitioner of the first repute  The Squire by a trick he thought proper to play contributed not a little to kindle the smothering embers My grandfather having announced his intention of demanding a commutation of nearly double the sum or of being paid his tythes in kindfirst his tythes  de jure  and next his tythes by custom enumerating them all and each corn hay hops and hemp fruits roots seeds and  weeds wool milk chickens ducklings and goslings or eggs corn rakings and pond drawings not forgetting agistment and  subbois  or  sylva caedua  with many many more of the sweets of our prolific mother earth which I would enumerate if I did but recollect them and for which men so often have been and still are impleaded in Court Christianthese particulars I say being recapitulated and set forth in terrible array by the rector excited in the whole parish so much dread of the rapacious vulture who was coming with such a swoop upon them that high and low young and old rich and poor all began to tremble  The Squire was the only man at first who durst bid defiance to the general ravager The rector's deviation from his original commutation agreement threw him into a rage and he panted for an opportunity of shewing the contempt in which he held my grandfather and his threats  Malicious chance favoured his wishes It happened while his passions were in full force that a ratcatcher arrived at Mowbray Hall which at that time was greatly infested by the large Norway rats The man had the art of taking them alive and was accordingly employed by the Squire While he was preparing to perform his business the gentle Olivia very innocently and without any foresight of consequences chanced to say "I do not think papa that our good rector who considers all things as tytheable would be much pleased to have his tythe of rats"The Squire no sooner heard this sentence uttered than he began to dance and halloo like a madman swearing most vociferously"By G wench he shall ha' um He shall ha' um He shall ha' um"  His boisterous joy at this rare thought which was indeed far beyond the discovery of his own brain could not be appeased nor could Olivia sorry for what  she had done prevent him from most resolutely determining to put it in practice The ratcatcher was immediately ordered to entrap as many of his best friends as he possibly could and a carpenter was set to work to make a covered box for the rector's tytherats with a lifting door Hector Mowbray was consulted on the whole progress and the fancies of father and son were tickled to excess by the happy prank they were about to play  The rats were caught the box was made and the ratcatcher commanded to select the finest fattest and largest of them and enclose them in their cage In order to heighten and secure their enjoyment the Squire and Hector chose four of the stoutest servants gave the cage into their custody and ordered the ratcatcher to attend Away they then went in turbulent procession They even wanted Olivia to go with them to see the sport and young Hector probably with malice prepense against me when  she refused was for using force but she was a favourite with the Squire and being very determined was suffered to remain at home  Arrived at the parsonagehouse they entered the hall The Squire loudly called for the rector The noise and vociferation of their approach had rouzed his attention and he was not long in coming The servants too were collected some without the door and others of more authority within it to hear and see what all this could mean I likewise was one of the company"Here here Mr Rector" bawled the Squire "we ha' brought you your due I'll warrant for once you sha'n't grumble that we do not pay you your tythes"  My grandfather hearing this address seeing the covered cage and remarking the malicious grins of the Squire and his whole posse knew not what to think and began to suspect there was mischief in the wind"By the waunds mister tythe taker" continued the Squire "but  you shall ha' your own Here lads lift up the cage put it on the table let his reverence see what we ha' brought'n Come raise the door"  The men with each a broad grin upon his countenance did as they were bidden they lifted up the box raised the door and out burst above twenty of the largest wildest rats the well stocked barns of Mowbray Hall could afford Their numbers their squealing their ferocity their attempts to escape and the bounds they gave from side to side struck the whole parsonage house community with a panic The women screamed the rector foamed the squire hallooed and the men seized bellows poker tongs and every other weapon or missile that was at hand The uproar was universal and the Squire never before or after felt himself so great a hero The death of the fox itself was unequal to it  This was but the first act of the farce the catastrophe of which had something  in it of a more tragical cast Servants partake of the prejudices of their masters and the whole parsonagehouse young and old male and female felt itself insulted No sooner therefore were the rats discomfited than the rector summoning all his magisterial and orthodox dignity commanded the Squire and his troop to depart Despising the mandate Magog Mowbray continued his exultations and coarse sarcasms and Oh frailty of human nature the man of God forgot the peaceful precepts of his divine mission and gave the signal for a general assault Nay he himself so unruly are the hands and feet even of a parson in a passion was one of the most eager combatants Age itself could not bind his arms  The battle raged fierce and dreadful for sometime in the hall but heroism soon found it wanted elbowroom and the two armies by mutual consent sallied forth Numbers were in our favour for the very  maids armed with mophandles broomsticks and rolling pins acted like Amazons I was far from idle for I had singled out my foe Hector whose courage example had enflamed to a very unruly height had even dared to begin the attack and I was no less alert in opposition But though he was Hector I as it happened was Achilles and bestowed my wrath upon him most unsparingly In fine valour victory and right were for once united and we very fairly put the Squire his heir his ratcatcher and his beefeaters to flight  The rector dreading a second attack from the enemy began to fortify his castle provide ammunition and arrange his troops I acted as his aid de camp burning to be myself commander in chief But the caution was superfluous the Squire like his son was rather revengeful than valorous and returned no more to the field  In the parish however the fortune of  the day might be said to wear a very different face for there was not a farmer who did not triumph at the tythe in kind which had been paid to the rector and it became a general threat to sweep the parish of moles weazles stoats polecats and vermin of every species and tenant the rectory with them if any thing more was heard on the subject of tythes Neither did detraction forget to remind the rector of his age and how shameful it was for a man with one foot in the grave to quarrel with and rob the poor farmers whom he was hired to guide console and love The poor farmers forgot that in the eye of the law the robbery was theirs and the rector forgot that in the eye of justice and common sense he had already more than enough The framers of the law too forgot that to hire a man to love a whole parish is but a blundering kind of a mode But such mistakes are daily made  CHAP XI  DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE BATTLE OLIVIA OFFENDED LEGAL DISTINCTIONS AND LAWSUITS COMMENCED  THE rumours of the village soon made it apparent that the history of the battle royal as given by the vanquished party like many other histories deviated in various particulars from the strict truth Thus the Squire asserted that he and his myrmidons quitted the field victoriously drums beating and colours flying after having driven the enemy back into their citadel and strong holds out of which they durst not peep and to the truth of what the Squire asserted his trusty adherents made it a case of conscience to swear  Encouraged by so good an example Hector vaunted loudly of his own high feats of arms and by his narration made it appear not only how much he had the  best of the battle with me but that it was by kicking him when up kneeing him when down striking him when rising and other such like cowardly foul and malicious acts that he brought home such a quantity of bruises of which with all his valour he bitterly complained together with a pair of black eyes  Knowing my partiality for his sister and suspecting that Olivia herself was not without her inclinations he did not fail to repeat these particulars when she was present carefully adding such other injurious accusations and epithets as might most effectually lower me in her esteem His efforts were successful Olivia was offended first that her brother should be so cruelly beaten by one of whom she had conceived so kindly and next that it should be by such base and dishonourable means Thus one of my chief pleasures that of visiting at Mowbray Hall admiring and sometimes mounting the Squire's hunters and straying  through the gardens and grounds with the gentle Olivia was cut off  Hector by this time had passed the age of sixteen and the wrath of the Squire rose so high that he would not suffer him any longer to go to the same school with me for which reason it being a part of his plan to send his heir to the university that he might not only be a Squire but a man of learning and thus become greater even than his father before him preparations and arrangements were made something sooner than had been intended and not long afterward he was entered a gentleman commoner of ****** college Oxford  It has been noticed that the farmers thought more of the vexation of their case than of the law but not so the rector he thought first of the law and the law told him that the vexation of the case relative to tythes was all in his favour Of the late affray with the Squire indeed he had his doubts As  for the entrance upon his premises though it might be pleaded it was for a lawful purpose namely that of paying tythes yet as rats were  ferae naturae  and therefore things not tythable it was very plain that this was a case of trespass  ab initio  and his action would lie for  a trespass vi et armis  But unfortunately passion had prevented him from waiting to bring his action and he had assumed the  vi et armis  to himself in the first instance not having patience to attend the slow and limping pace of the law He was not indeed quite certain that although he and his party gave the first blows an action of battery brought against Mowbray might not be justified for did he not come upon him in full force he the rector being in the peace of God and our Lord the King And did not he the Squire by shouting and oaths and blasphemous words put him the rector in bodily fear And was not the very act of turning ferocious animals  namely Norway rats loose in his hall to the danger of his face eyes and throat a very indubitable and sufficient assault Was it not likewise clearly in self defence that the rector and his faithful servants did  molliter manus imponere  on the Squire and his crewThe  molliter  it is true appeared rather doubtful but then it was a term of law and would bear that exact signification which the circumstances of the case required and lawyers so well know how to give  Thus with law in his head wrath in his heart and money in his pocket away went the rector to hold consultations with his now favourite friend the attorney who has before been mentioned as so thorough bred and far famed a practitioner the result of which was that an action of  trespass upon the case  as the safest mode of proceeding should be brought against the Squire and that public information should be given that tythes in kind would in six months be  demanded from the whole parish with a formal notice that as malicious threatenings had been uttered against the rector whom the laws civil common and ecclesiastical would protect if any such threatenings should be put in execution actions against the offenders would immediately be instituted  It was the spring of the year when these resolutions were taken and before the end of the following November the rector in consequence of squabbles insults and frauds had brought actions against more than half his parishioners by which the attornies counsellors and courts were in the end the only gainers while plaintiff and defendant most ardently concurred and rejoiced in the ruin of each other But so it is anger avarice and law are terrible things and malice and selfishness are indefatigable foes  CHAP XII  PROGRESS OF MY STUDIES MY PREDILECTION IN FAVOUR OF THEOLOGY THE DECAY OF THE RECTOR HIS TESTAMENT DEATH AND FUNERAL  THREE additional years passed away under the auspices of my grandfather during which he pursued his lawsuits and I my studies though with very different success he lost the dearest thing on earth to him his money and I gained the dearest thing on earth to me knowledge Among other superfluous appendages superfluous to him for he made but little use of it he had a good library Not of his own collecting he enjoyed it by descent This was my daily resort Its treasures were inexhaustible and my desire of information could not be satiated I spent many happy hours in it and it is still remembered by me  with that sweet pleasure which its contents were so well calculated to impart  I had another accidental advantage The usher of the school got preferment and his successor happened to be well read both in the dead and living languages This person whose name was Wilmot was not only a good scholar and an amiable man but an excellent poet He had an affection for me and I almost worshipped him He was assiduous to teach me every thing he knew and fortunately I was no less apt and eager to learn Having already made a tolerable proficiency in the learned languages the richness of the French in authors made me labour to acquire it with avidity The Italian poets were equally inviting so that by his aid I mastered the idioms and attained the spirit of both those languages The dialects of the Teutonic were likewise familiar to him and I made some progress in the German being desirous  from his recommendation to read among others the works of Lessing Klopstock Goethe and Schiller The acquirement of knowledge is an essential and therefore a pure pleasure and my time though laboriously spent glided swiftly and happily away  With respect to amusement the violin became my favourite My now dearest friend the usher among his other attainments was a musician my affection for him had made him intimate at the parsonagehouse and his aid greatly promoted our musical parties  Finding knowledge thus delightful my zeal to promulgate it was great I had as I imagined so much to communicate that I panted for an opportunity to address myself to multitudes At that time I knew no place so well calculated for this purpose as the pulpit and my inclination to be a preacher was tolerably conformable to the views of the rector Not but he had his doubts  Few men are satisfied with their own profession and though he had great veneration for church authority which he held to be infinitely superior from its very nature to civil government yet his propensity to dabble in the law had practically and theoretically taught him some of the advantages of its professors In rank it was true that the Archbishop of Canterbury was the second man in the kingdom and in the rector's opinion ought to have been indisputably the first In days of yore who so potent But obsolete titles are not equal to actual possessions The Lord High Chancellor in this degenerate age enjoys much more political power Neither does it in general die with him like that of the Archbishop He seldom fails to bequeath an earldom of a barony at least to his heir  On these subjects I had frequent lectures from my grandfather who perceiving the enterprise of my temper and the progress of my studies began to entertain  hopes that from his loins some future noble family might descend that is provided I would follow the advice which he so well knew how to bestow In support of his argument he would give me the history of the origin of various Barons Viscounts and Earls which he could trace to some of the lowest departments of the law  Thus though he was convinced that the sacerdotal character claimed unlimited authority by right divine yet from the perverse and degenerate nature of man it was most lamentably sinking into decay while that of the law was rising on its ruins Had he been a man of the world instead of the rector of a village he would have heard of another profession superior to them both for the attainment of what he most coveted power rank and wealth and would have known that the lawyer only soars to the possession of these supposed blessings by  learning a new trade that is by making himself a politician  The effect his maxims produced on me was a conviction that divinity and law were two superexcellent things But my mind from many circumstances had acquired a moral turn and as I at that time supposed morality and religion to be the same the current of my inclinations was strong in favour of divinity Whoever imagines the youthful mind cannot easily acquire such moral propensities has never observed it except when habit and example have already taught it to be perverse I speak from experience and well know how much the accounts I had read of Aristides Epaminondas Regulus Cato and innumerable other great characters among the ancients inflamed my imagination and gave me a rooted love of virtue so that even the vulgarly supposed dry precepts of Seneca and Epictetus were perused by  me with delight and with an emulous determination to put them in practice  My morality however was far from pure it was such a mixture of truth and error as was communicated to me by conversation books and the incidents of life From the glow of poetry I learnt many noble precepts but from the same source I derived the pernicious supposition that to conquer countries and exterminate men are the acts of heroes Further instances would be superfluous I mean only to remark that while I was gaining numerous truths I was likewise confirming myself in various prejudices many of which it has been the labour of years aided by the lessons of accident to eradicate and many more no doubt still remain undetected  And now the period approached when I was to adventure forth into that world of which I had experienced something had heard so much and with which I was so impatient to become still better  acquainted The weight of age began to press upon the rector and he had an apoplectic fit at which he was very seriously alarmed He then thought it high time to put his temporal affairs into the best order that his own folly would admit for in consequence of his lawsuits they were so much in the hands and power of his friend the lawyer that notwithstanding the plausibility and professions of the latter he trembled when he came to reflect how much they were involved His former parsimony had led him to hope he should leave great wealth behind him but when he came to consult his friend concerning his will he had the mortification to find how much it had been diminished by his litigious avarice  The will however was made but it was under this friend's direction and influence The lawyer was a lawyer and affecting the character of disinterestedness reminded the rector of the folly of  youth and in how short a period money that had taken a life to acquire was frequently squandered by a thoughtless heir His advice therefore was that the property should be left to my mother and that she should have a joint executor This executor ought to be the most honest of men and the dearest of friends or he would never perform so very arduous and unprofitable a task with fidelity and effect a task as thankless as it is laborious and which nothing should prevail on him to undertake but the desire to serve some very dear and much esteemed friend  With respect to my mother and me I was her darling and there was no danger that she should marry again at least infinitely less than that a young man should abuse wealth of which he had not by experience learned the value By making me dependent my assiduity would be increased but that all might be safe it might perhaps be well to set  apart a sum for my maintenance at the university and if I should decide for the church when I quitted it another for the purchase of an advowson or if for the law to place me in the office of some eminent practitioner  This counsel was so much that of a man of foresight and knowledge of the world that my grandfather heard it with pleasure It was literally followed One hundred per annum for four years residence at the university was allotted me and a legacy of a thousand pounds was added which though the purchase of an advowson was recommended was entrusted to my discretion and when I should come of age left to my own disposal The will was then copied and signed and the lawyer at the request of a dear and dying friend was prevailed on to be joint executor with my mother This was the last legal act and deed of the rector for he died within a month and with him died his few friendships his many enmities  and his destructive lawsuits His spiritual flock was right glad that he was gone and his funeral was only attended by my mother myself the lawyer the master and usher of the grammar school and a few visiting friends  When the will was opened I and my mother were necessarily present The rector had detailed the arguments which his friend had suggested he mentioned his fears of youthful folly but spoke of me with affection and hope and seriously warned my mother for my sake to beware of a second marriage with which requisition she very solemny affirmed it was her determination to comply I was young and high in expectation for Hugh the second was scarcely less sanguine of temper than Hugh the first Few people in the world I was persuaded were possessed of such extraordinary abilities as myself I had read in a thousand places of the high rewards bestowed on men of learning wit and genius I was therefore  eager to sally forth convinced that I need only be seen to be admired and known to be employed These ideas were so familiar to my mind that I intreated my mother to lay no restraint upon her inclinations for I well knew how to provide for myself but she was wounded by the request and begged I would not kill her by a supposition so cutting so unaffectionate and so unamiable The energy with which she expressed herself somewhat surprized me a kind of good humoured chearfulness which resembled indifference rather than sentiment was the leading feature in my mother's character She was however on this occasion more sentimental because as I supposed more in earnest than usual  CHAP XIII  PREPARATIONS FOR PARTING A JOURNEY MORE OF EDUCATION OR SOMETHING TO BE LEARNED IN A STAGE COACH  THESE solemn affairs being adjusted and by the lapse of a few weeks we the mourners more reconciled to our loss it began to be necessary for me to prepare for my removal to the university for it was there only according to the wise laws of our wise forefathers and who will dare to suppose that our forefathers were foolish or could make foolish laws that a regular and incontestible induction can be obtained to the holy ministry of which I was ambitious  It was determined I should enter of ****** college Oxford the same at which Hector Mowbray had been admitted and to which all the scholars from the grammar school where I was educated repaired But there was a warm contest  whether I should enter as a commoner or a gentleman commoner My mother was eager for the latter which the lawyer opposed She could not endure that her dear Hugh should as it were publicly confess the superiority of his rival and sworn foe the insolent Hector He contended that to affect to rival him in expence were absurd and might lead to destructive consequences The lawyer had the best of the argument yet I was inclined to take part with my mother Inferiority was what I was little disposed to acknowledge I therefore consulted my friend the usher Fortunately he had more wisdom and alledged some very convincing moral motives which I too much respected to disobey  Previous to my departure I endured much lecturing which I considered as exceedingly useless and consequently little less than impertinent The lawyer reminded me of my youth and warned me against the knavery of mankind who he  affirmed are universally prone to prey upon one another This miracles out of the question must be the creed of a lawyer I had a better opinion of my fellow bipeds of whom I yet knew but little and heard him with something like contempt My mother wearied me with intreaties to write to her at least once a week She should never be easy out of my sight if she did not hear from me frequently The omission of a mail would throw her into the utmost terrors she should conclude I was sick or dying nay perhaps dead and she conjured me to respect her maternal feelings I did respect them and promised all she required She was desirous too that I should continually be with her during the vacations The lawyer on the contrary advised me to remain at college and pursue my studies  It will seem very unnatural to most mothers and highly censurable to many moralists that the person whom I felt  the greatest regret at parting with was my instructor and friend the usher He was no less affectionate He too cautioned me against youthful confidence and hinted that men were not quite so good as they should be I knew him to be a little inclined to melancholy and that he considered himself as a neglected man who had reason to complain of the world's injustice But though the belief that this was true moved my compassion he did not convince me that men were constitutionally inclined to evil My own feelings loudly spoke the contrary I had not yet been initiated I knew but little of those false wants by which the mind of man is perverted The credulity of youth can only be cured by the experience of age the prejudices of age can only be eradicated by appealing to the feelings and facts of youth Man becomes what the mistaken institutions of society inevitably make him his tendency is to promote his own well being and the well  being of the creatures around him these can only be promoted by virtue consequently when he is vicious it is from mistake and his original sin is ignorance  My books clothes and effects were forwarded to the next market town through which the coach that I was to travel in passed That I might meet it in time on Monday morning it was necessary to set out the evening before and sleep at the inn My mind was by no means free from popular prejudices when they were of a moral cast and I was not entirely satisfied at beginning my journey on a Sunday I struggled against the nonsense of ill omens for I had read books in which they were ridiculed but I was not quite certain that the action was in itself right Things however were thus arranged and my friends were assembled to take leave of me The lawyer's reiterated advice teased me my mother's tears gave me pain but the pressure of the usher's  hand and his cordial 'God be with you' went to my heart However the sun shone the month was May the grass was green the birds were singing my hopes were mantling and my cares were soon forgotten I seemed to look back on my past existence as on a kind of imprisonment and my spirits fluttered as if just set free to wander through a world of unknown delights  Fortune was disposed to favour the delusive vision for at the inn on the morrow being roused from a sound sleep to pursue my journey after stepping into the coach I found myself seated opposite to the handsomest sweetest young Lady I had ever beheld I except Olivia but her I had only known as it were a child and I looked back on those as on childish days The lovely creature was clothed in a skyblue ridinghabit with embroidered buttonholes and a green hat and feather with suitable decorations She had a delicate twisted canewhip  in her hand a nosegay in her bosom and a purple cestus round her waist There were beside two gentlemen in the coach genteelly dressed and they all appeared to know each other  The young lady sopke to every body without the least reserve or pride which did but increase the good opinion I had conceived of her The gentlemen likewise were easy and familiar and in spite of my friend the lawyer I already plainly perceived the world was a very good humoured polite and pleasant world The young lady was peculiarly attentive and kind to me and I being but  a raw traveller  insisted that the gentleman next her should change places with me that I might sit with my face toward the horses lest I should be sick by riding backward At this however my manly pride revolted and I obstinately kept my seat notwithstanding her very obliging intreaties The phrase  raw traveller  I did not think quite so politely and happily chosen as the rest  but then it fell from such a pair of modest lips that it was impossible to conceive offence  After a pleasant ride of three hours we arrived at the breakfasting place The coach door was opened and I not waiting for the steps leaped out like a young greyhound The lady seemed half inclined to follow me but was timid I placed myself properly promised to catch her and she sprang into my arms Suddenly recollecting herself she exclaimed 'What a wild creature I am' and ran away hiding her face with her hands I blamed myself for having been too forward and inwardly applauded her quick sense of propriety The gentlemen laughed walked into the breakfastingroom and invited me to follow them  In about ten minutes the young lady entered with apologies and hoping we knew the rules of travelling too well to wait She seemed improved in beauty There was a kind of bloom spread over  her countenance contrasted with a deli+cate pearl white such as I had never seen in the finest cherry cheeks of our village maidens 'It is the blush at the little incident of leaping from the coach said I to myself that has thus improved her complexion' She sat down to the table and with the kindness that seemed native to her poured out my tea sugared and creamed it just to my taste and handed it to me with sweetness that was quite seducing I knew not how to return or to merit her favours and the attempt made me mawkishly sentimental 'It is delightful said I when amiable people live together in happy society' 'It is indeed' said she and her bosom appeared gently to heave  Our feelings seemed to vibrate in unison but they were disturbed by a sudden burst of coughing of one of the gentlemen drinking his tea and were not much harmonized by a fit of laughing with which the other was seized who  told his companion he was  a droll dog  But what the drollery could be of a man choaked with swallowing too hastily was more than I could comprehend The appellation of  droll dog  however was repeated till the two gentlemen could appease their titillation I own I thought it a little rude but they seemed neither of them so wellbred as the lady and I concluded they could be nothing more than travelling acquaintance I even supposed I saw them wink at each other as if there had been something strange or improper in my behaviour  I then thought it quite necessary to let them know who I was Accordingly I took an opportunity of succinctly telling them whence I came where I was going who my relations were and what my expectations I let them understand that I had money in my purse and gave broad hints that I was neither fool nor coward They were quite civil but still their looks to each other seemed very significant  and to have more meaning than I knew how to develope I was a little piqued but comforted myself with the assurance that I should show them their mistake if they conjectured any thing to my disadvantage  Breakfast over we returned to the coach and after handing the young lady I stepped in as lightly as I had stepped out She again insisted I should not ride backward and I for my former reason refused to change my place till one of those abrupt gentlemen exclaimed 'What my young buck are you afraid of a petticoat' 'Oh fie' said the young lady  Rouzed by this insulting supposition and despising every kind of cowardice I immediately crossed over and took my seat by her side 'Men fellows are very rude horsegodmother kind of creatures' said the young ladyThe colour flushed in my face'Men fellows Horsegodmother' It was strange I was  more than half afraid she meant me 'Not all of them I hope' said I as soon as I could recollect myself'No not all of them' answered the young lady with a gentle smile and a glance that I thought had meaning  My flow of spirits being somewhat checked by the behaviour of the gentlemen I sat silent and they fell into conversation by which I learned that one of them was a gentleman of great fortune in Wales and the other a captain in the army and that they were well acquainted with London Dublin Bath Brighthelmstone and all places of fashionable resort The young lady too had not only been at each of them but had visited Paris and mentioned many persons of quality with whom as it appeared from her discourse she was quite familiar It was evident from all she said that she knew how to distinguish the well bred and the polite She was immensely shocked at any thing that was ungenteel  and low  it was prodigiously horrid  The whole discourse indeed convinced me that they were all people of consequence and that my supposition of ill breeding on the part of the gentlemen must have been hasty  One thing however surprised me and particularly drew my attention I valued myself on my knowledge of languages and the quickness of my ear yet though they continually spoke English they introduced occasional words and phrases which to me were wholly unintelligible▪ One especially of these phrases seemed so strange that I repeated it to myself again and again It was  The kinchin will bite the bubble  I pondered and fifty times questioned'Who is  the kinchin  What is  bite the bubble  But in vain it was incomprehensible  We did not stop to dine till between four and five o'clock and then the young lady at alighting was more circumspect She having retired the gentlemen asked me if I would take a  turn to the river side at the back of the inn and I to shew that I now understood their characters better willingly complied As I was following them the landlord who had attended while we were alighting plucked me by the skirt and looking significantly after my companions whispered'Take care of yourself young gentleman' then hastily brushed by The first moment I thought it strange the second I exclaimed to myself'Ah ha I guessed how it was I soon found them out But if they have any tricks to play they shall find I am as cunning as they The landlord need not have cautioned me I am not so easily caught'  Thus fortified I proceeded boldy and we had not walked two hundred yards before one of them who had stepped forward stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he instantly began to read▪ 'S'death' exclaimed he as we approached 'here is a bill at three days sight for  fifteen guineas drawn on Fairlamb and Company bankers at Oxford You are acquainted with country bills captain' said he presenting it to his companion 'do you think it a good one' His companion took it examined it upside and down to the light and from it and replied'As good as the bank But we must share' 'To be sure we must' said the finder 'Why should you doubt it 'Tis a trifle five guineas a piece but it will serve to pay travelling expences'  They laughed and I was staggered at this honourable and generous conduct I have proceeded too hastily thought I and the landlord is own cousin to our lawyer he thinks every man a rogue Their liberality is proof sufficient in their favour'Come give us our five guineas a piece' said the gentleman of Wales to the captain'I have no ready cash' answered he 'I never chuse when I am travelling to have more money in my  pocket than barely enough for expences' 'That is exactly my case' replied the Welsh gentleman 'But perhaps our young friend may be less cautious and may have loose cash sufficient''I had twelve guineas' said I 'when I left home' 'Oh that will just do' answered the captain 'We turn off tomorrow morning for Cirencester you are going to Oxford otherwise our luck would have been lost upon us for we would not have gone a mile out of our road for such a trifle'  My hand was in my pocket and the guineas were between my fingers when my heart smote me The landlord's significant 'Take care of yourself young gentleman' my own sagacious conjectures when he gave me this warning and their strange phrase of  bite the bubble  all rose to my recollection They shall not make a tool and a jest of me said I to myself  The gentleman of Wales seeing me hesitate jogged me by the elbow and said'Come come we must dispatch dinner is on the table by this time and the coach will not wait a minute' 'Those who think me a fool' replied I with something of indignation in my countenance 'will find themselves deceived''What do you mean by that Sir' retorted the captain'Strange language for a gentleman'  I stopped a moment my conscience smote me If I should mistake the character of these gentlemen thought I my behaviour will appear contemptible 'Do you mean to insult us' said the gentleman of WalesThe captain once more saw my hand in my pocket I caught his eye he winked to his companion and said 'No no the young gentleman knows better'Yes' answered I instantly fired 'I know better than to give my money to sharpers''Sharpers' retorted one'Sharpers' reechoed  the other and began mutually to hustle meMy valour was roused I faced about with the first blow laid the gentleman of Wales sprawling and with the second made the captain's eyes strike fire The attack was infinitely more vigorous and powerful than they could have expected The Welsh gentleman shook his ears the captain clapped his white handkerchief to his eyes They swore a few oaths in concert but neither of them seemed desirous to continue the combat Such an attack from a stripling was quite out of all calculation If however I could guess their motives from their manner they were rather those of caution than of cowardice Be that as it will I could better deal out hard blows than utter coarse expressions and I left them with a look of contempt  Entering the dinner room I found the young lady and told her the story She was all astonishment Could not believe her ears Was never so deceived in her  life Was immensely glad that she now knew her company She had seen them at Bath and had imagined them to be as they professed themselves gentlemen but people do not know who and who are together at such public places She was sorry to ride in the same carriage with them but dine with them she would not I asked if I might be permitted that honour and she readily replied 'Certainly Sir you are a gentleman'  Proud to be thus distinguished after dinner I insisted on paying the bill and she still more strenuously insisted I should not She pulled out her purse which seemed well filled and put down her quota which no entreaties could prevail on her to take back It was her rule  The horses being ready we were summoned to our seats which we took in pairs the gentleman of Wales and the captain sitting in sullen silence and the young  lady not deigning to address a word to them  At night we again paired off and I was admitted to be her companion at supper she continuing to treat me since their detection with a marked partiality  Supper being over and the lady unfortunately as she said for her being to travel the Cirencester road with those odious sharpers I was again exceedingly desirous to shew some trifling mark of respect by discharging the bill which she again peremptorily refused to accept Unluckily however going to draw her purse as before she could not find it'It was exceedingly strangeInfinitely distressing What could have become of it Thirty guineas were but a trifle but to lose them at such a moment was very tormenting'She felt again and having no better success her features assumed a very dismal and tragical cast  None but a heart of stone could endure  unmoved the anxiety and distress of so kind so amiable and so lovely a creature I took my eleven guineas my whole store except a few shillings told her it was all I had but intreated she would not put me to the pain of refusing the little supply I had to afford  She thanked me infinitely recollected she had left her purse when she retired after dinner to comb up her dishevelled hair having taken it out with the comb and totally forgotten it repeated that she was proceeding to London for which a single guinea would perhaps be sufficient but unfortunately she was obliged to pass through Cirencester having a poor relation there that was sick and in absolute want and to whom she had promised an immediate relief of ten guineas with an intention of further support However she could not think of accepting my offer it had so strange an appearance And she would rather suffer  any thing than forfeit the good opinion of a gentleman especially after having conversed with those good for nothing men as if acquainted with them but of whom she knew nothing and had therefore supposed no harm  The debate was long and managed on both sides with almost equal ardour At length however I prevailed on her to take ten of the eleven guineas but not till she had given me a draft on her banker Signed Harriet Palmer which she assured me would be honoured the instant it should be presented I took it to satisfy her scruples but I had read the old romances and too well understood the gallantry due from a gentleman to a lady to think of putting it to the use she intended I lingered and knew not how to take leave but the coach would only allow her three hours repose I therefore reluctantly bade her good night and we parted with mutual  admiration hoping for some fortunate opportunity of renewing our acquaintance  CHAP XIV  MORNING THOUGHTS CONJECTURES AND EXPECTATIONS A SPECIMEN OF OXFORD MANNERS BEING ANOTHER NEW LESSON  LEFT by myself on the morrow and revolving in my mind the events of the preceding day I had occasional doubts which had I suffered them to prevail would have been exceedingly mortifying The young lady was certainly a beautiful lady was modest too and well bred I had seen nothing to impeach her virtue on the contrary it had been the principal topic of our discourse 'Tis true I had as became me been too respectful to put her chastity to any proof I was not so discourteous a knight  But then that she should have been so intimate as she appeared to be with those gentlemen sharpers that she should be going the same road that she should lose her purse in so odd a manner and that she should accept my ten guineas were circumstances that dwelt irksomely upon my mind Yet it was totally improbable that so sweet a young creature should be trammeled in vice What be the companion of such men relate a string of falsehoods give a forged draft on a banker and even shed tears at distress which if it were not real was a most base and odious artifice That she could act so cunning and so vile a part and I not detect her was wholly incredible I was very unwilling to imagine I could be so imposed upon so duped  A raw traveller  If so raw indeed Of all suppositions that was the most humiliating I endeavoured but in vain to banish suspicion In fine whatever might be the cause which I could not very  well develope I sound the soliloquies of the morning by no means so fascinating as the visions of the preceding evening  Wearied of this subject I turned my thoughts into a new channel and endeavoured to conjecture what Oxford was and what kind of people were its inhabitants I had heard it described and remembered the leading features its expansive streets aspiring turrets noble buildings and delightful walks The picture rose to magnificence but the wisdom learning and virtue of its sages and their pupils were still more sublime High minded and noble youths thirsting after knowledge assembled under the auspices of philosophers whose science was profound and whose morals were pure The whole fabric rising in beautiful order undergraduates bachelors masters doctors professors presidents heads of colleges high stewards and chancellors each excelling the other in worth as in dignity Their manners engaging  their actions unblemished and their lives spent in the delightful regions of learning and truth It must be the city of angels and I was hastening to reside among the blest A band of seers living in fraternity governed by one universal spirit of benevolence harmonized by one vibrating system of goodness celestial Among such beings evil and foolish men could find no admittance for they could find no society  Theology too would here be seen in all her splendour active energetic and consolatory not disturbed by doubt not disgraced by acrimony not slumbering in sloth not bloated with pride not dogmatical not intolerant not rancorous not persecuting not inquisitorial but diffusing her mild yet clear and penetrating beams through the soul where all could not but be light and life and love Oh Oxford said I thou art the seat of the muses thou art the nurse of  wisdom thou art the mother of virtue I own my expectations were high  My reveries concerning my old companion Hector were in the same tone I had heard that he had often been down at Mowbray Hall during vacation time but the mutual interdiction of our families had prevented our meeting He cannot but be greatly altered said I It is impossible he should have remained so long in this noble seminary and continue the same selfish sensual and halfbrutal Hector Mowbray whom formerly I knew I regretted our quarrel he might now have become an agreeable companion perhaps a friend Olivia too She had a sister's partiality for him before she might now love him infinitely and justly  While I sat ruminating the coach continued rolling onward over hill and dale passing house hedge row and heath till the towers and turrets of Oxford came in view My heart bounded at  the sight and active fancy industriously continued her fictions We entered the city and drove clattering along to one of the principal inns  The moment the coachman pulled up I stepped out of the carriage and into the street It was the eve of a new term the gownsmen were swarming carriages and horsmen post haste were arriving the bells were ringing waiters and footmen were hurrying to and fro and all was dazzle all was life Eager to mingle in the scene I walked up and down the high street saw college after college hall after hall and church after church The arches the pillars the quadrangles rose in incessant and astonishing succession My eyes turned from building to building gazing with avidity adding wonder to wonder and filling the mind with rapture 'It is all that I had imagined' said I 'and much much more Happy city happy people and happy I that am come to be one  among you Now and now only I begin to live'  Fearful of bewildering myself in this fairy land I turned back to the inn but continued gazing with new amazement at every step Just as I came to the gate I heard the galloping of horses behind me looked round and there most unexpectedly saw Hector Mowbray pulling up his horse with two livery servants three greyhounds and a brace of pointers at his heels He had new boots buckskin breeches a buff waistcoat a scarlet coat with a green collar and a gold button and loop tassel and hatband I was within a yard of him when he alighted 'Bless me' said I 'Mr Mowbray''Gdmy blood Trevor Is it you'  The apostrophe startled me  Hector gave three loud cracks with his whip whistled his dogs and with a Stentor voice called after one of his servants 'Why holloa You blind blood of a  w Why Sam G shiver your soul what are you about Uncouple Jerry Sneak and Jowler and give limping Jenny's ear a 'nointingD my body Trevor I'm glad to see you When did you arrive How did you come In stile a chaise and four smoking the road raising a mist'I was ashamed of my stagecoach vehicle and was silent'What my buck are you to be one of us''I am''Dmy b that's rightJack Singleton Jack G blunder your body Why don't you answer you shamble shanked beggar's baby Go to the Bursar and tell him to send supper for six and claret for sixteen served up to a minute Do you hearD my body I'm glad to see you We'll make a night ont What are you come to enter at our college' 'Yes''D my soul I'm glad ont Dn me our college will be the go Dn me we are a rare string already Dn me we shall beat them all hollow Dn me now you're come dn me  we shall dn meHolloa Sam Run you blood of a w yonder's Lord Saddog turning the corner in his phaeton four in hand scamper away and tell him dn me he must sup with me to night Tell him by G he must he and the jolly dog his tutor Tell him we have a new comer a friend a freshman piping hot dn me from our village and that we must make him free of Oxford to night dn me Do you hear'  Astound breathless thunderstruck at this intolerable profaneness I stood like an idiot unable to speak or think Hector took hold of my arm and dragged me along I obeyed for I was insensible soulless and even when the return of thought came it was all confusion Was this Oxford Were these its manners Were such its inhabitants Oaths twenty in a breath unmeaning vulgar oaths ribaldry such as till that hour I had never heard  What could I do I was a stranger Were they all equally depraved and equally contemptibleThat said I to myself is what I wish to know and I suffered him to lead me wherever he pleased  He took me to inns coffeehouses and halls to call on one companion and  beat up  for another I saw the buildings the architecture doubtless was the same but the scene was changed The beauties of Oxford were vanished I was awakened from the most delightful of dreams to a disgusting reality and would have given kingdoms to have once more renewed my trance The friends of Hector though not all of them his equals in turbulence profaneness and folly were of the same school Their language though less coarse was equally insipid Their manners when not so obtrusive were more bald They all cursed blustered and behaved with insolence in proportion to the money they spent or  the time they had been at the university The chief difference was that those who were less rich and less hardened than he had less spirit that is had less noise nonsense and swagger But though the scene was not what I expected it was new and in a certain sense enlivening and my flowing spirits were soon at their accustomed height  The president had been written to and I was expected at college where when we came and my arrival was announced I found an apartment prepared for my reception Passing through the common room I saw a face which I thought I recollected 'Is not that Turl' said I to Hector'Pshaw dn me take no notice of such a  raff  ' replied he and stalked away I was too ignorant of college cant at that time to know that  raff  was the term of contempt for poverty  As we passed through the quadrangle the president entering the gate saw Hector in his scarlet green and gold and  without his gown and cap and beckoned to him Hector to evade as I afterward learned what he expected introduced me The president eyed me for a moment received me graciously and desired me to call on him in the morning He then asked Mowbray why he left his chamber in that dress and without his gown Hector answered he had only arrived the day before had been to take a ride and had mislaid his cap which was not to be found but he had a new one coming home in the morning The president after saying'Well Sir I request I may not meet you in this manner again' passed on The story of the cap mislaid was a direct falsehood the old and new cap were both in his chamber for he had been trying them on and asking me which looked the best Hector winked his eye lolled his tongue and said to me 'That's the way dn me to hum the old ones'  Supper time presently came and Hector and his companions were assembled Beside Lord Saddog and his tutor there was a senior fellow and a master of arts all of our college and all of them the prime bucks of the place My late high expectations of learning and virtue were entirely forgotten There was novelty in every word they uttered and I listened to their conversation with the most attentive ardour Nor did I feel astonishment to hear that dogs horses gluttony drunkenness and debauchery were the grand blessings of life Hector had prepared me to hear any thing with but little surprise The Lord and the Squire gloried in braving and breaking the statutes of the college and the university the tutor fellow and master of arts in eluding them The history they gave of themselves was that the former could ride drive swear kick scoundrels bilk prostitutes commit adultery and breed riots the latter could cant lie act the  hypocrite hum the proctors and protect their companions in debauchery in gluttony drunkenness and libidinous thoughts they were all avowed rivals  Hector descending to trifling vices vaunted of having been five times in one week  imposed  that is reprimanded by set tasks for having neglected lectures and prayers and worn scarlet green and gold while the more heroic Lord Saddog told how he had been twice privately  rusticated  for an amour with the barmaid of a coffeehouse whom he dared the vicechancellor himself to banish the city Fearful of being surpassed they exaggerated their own wickedness and often imputed crimes to themselves which they had neither the opportunity nor the courage to commit  That I might appear worthy of the choice group among whom I was admited Hector by relating in a distorted manner things that had happened but attributing to me such motives as he  imagined he should have been actuated by had he been the agent told various falsehoods of my exploits I had too great a mixture of sheepishness and vanity to contradict him in such honourable society and therefore accepted praise at which I ought to have blushed  During supper while they were all gormandizing and encouraging me to do the same his lordship addressing his tutor asked'Dn me Jack can you tell me why it was I took you into my pay What the dmntn are you good for''Tell you To be sure I can You will not pretend that when you first came under my tuition you were the man you now are Who taught you to laugh at doctors bully proctors stare the vice chancellor out of countenance and parade the streets of a Sunday in sermon time but I''You''Yes I 'Dn my body well said Jack' roared Hector' 'Dn me you are a good one  Go it Keep it up Dn me go it' The tutor continued  'Of whom did you learn to scout the gownsmen cudgel the townsmen kiss their wives frighten their daughters and debauch their maids but I You were a mere tyro when I took you in hand you did not so much as know how to throw in a knock down blow''Why you lying son of a'  I must not repeat his lordship's reply or the continuation of the dialogue it was too gross to be read or written I only intend the above as a short specimen of what lords' private tutors at universities sometimes are and of the learning which their pupils sometimes acquire  While at supper I was continually plied to drink each pledging me in turn their intention being as Hector had declared to make me free that is as drunk as possible I had not the courage to incur  their ridicule by refusing my glass Beside my spirits were raised and my appetite which travelling had increased was good My constitution too was strong for it had been confirmed by exercise and a cheerful mind and never injured by excess For these reasons I stood their attacks far beyond their expectation and my manhood received no little applause  The night advanced and they grew riotous The lord and his tutor were for  sporting the door of a glum  that is breaking into the chamber of a gownsman who loves study Hector vociferously seconded the motion but the fellow and the master of arts cunningly endeavoured to keep them quiet first by persuasion and when that was ineffectual by affirming the students they proposed to attack  sported oak  in plain English barred up their doors Had they been without the walls of the college there  would have been a riot but having no other ventilator for their magnanimity they fell with redoubled fury to drinking and the jolly tutor proposed a rummer round'Dn me' said Hector 'that's a famous thought But you are a famous deep one dn me'  The rummers were seized the wine poured out and his lordship began with 'Dmntn to the flincher' Who should that be I the freshman Oh no For that night I was too far gone in good fellowship  This was the finishing blow to three of us Hector fell on the floor his lordship sunk in his chair and I after a hurrah and a hiccup began to  cast the cat  an Oxford phrase for what usually happens to a man after taking an emetic Happily I had not far to go and the fellow and the master of arts had just sense enough left to help me to my chamber where at day light next morning I found  myself on the hearth with my head resting against the fender the pain of which awakened me  CHAP XV  MORNING REFLECTIONS THE ADVICE OF A YOUTH AND THE CAUTION OF A GRAVE SENIOR ANOTHER RENCONTRE  DISCOVERING myself in this condition recollecting the scene in which I had so lately been an actor and feeling my stomach and head disordered and my whole frame burning with the debauch looking round too and seeing myself in a room where every object reminded me that I was a stranger and that the eyes of many strangers were upon me and my conduct I found but little cause of satisfaction either in myself the acquaintance I had made or the place to which I had come  The more I reflected the more was my mind disturbed I walked about the chamber unable to rid myself either of my sickly qualms the feverish distemper of my blood or the still more fevered distemperature of my mind It was a violent but I suspect it was a useful lesson After a while cold water washing cleaning and shifting my dress gave me a little relief  The air I thought would be refreshing but as I opened the door to descend the stairs Turl was passing and very kindly inquired after my health said he was happy to see me and asked if I were come to ent  r myself at the college Neglecting or rather at that moment despising Hector and his caution I answered in the same tone and invited him into my room  Too much ashamed to avow the debauch of which I had been guilty or the painful feelings that were the result I endeavoured by questions to gain the information  which might best appease my roused curiosity 'I am but just arrived' said I 'will you be kind enough to give me such intelligence as may aid me to regulate my conduct What I have hitherto seen has rather surprized and even disappointed me I hoped for perfection which I begin to doubt I shall not find What are the manners of the place' 'Such as must be expected from a multitude of youths who are ashamed to be thought boys and who do not know how to behave like men''But are there not people appointed to teach them'No' 'What is the office of the proctors heads of houses deans and other superintendants of whom I have heard''To watch and regulate the tufts of caps the tying of bands the stuff and tassels of which gowns are made to reprimand those who wear red or green and to take care that the gownsmen assemble at proper hours to hear prayers gabbled over as fast as tongue can give them utterance  or lectures at which both reader and hearers fall asleep' 'What are the public rewards for proficiency in learning' 'Few or in reality none''Beside numerous offices are not exhibitions fellowships professors chairs and presentations bestowed''Yes on those who have municipal or political influence or who by servility and effrontery can court patronage''Surely you have some men of worth and genius who meet their due reward''Few very few indeed Sloth inanity and bloated pride are here too often the characteristics of office Fastidiousness is virtue and to keep the poor and unprotected in awe a duty The rich indeed are indulged in all the licentious liberties they can desire' 'Why do so many young men of family resort hither''Some to get what is to be given away others are sent by their parents who imagine the place to be the reverse of what it is and a third set intended for the church are obliged to go  to a university before they can be admited into holy orders''That rule I have heard is not absolute''It is supposed here to be little less''Then you would not advise a young person to come to this city to complete his education''If he possess extraordinary fortitude and virtue yes if not I would have him avoid Oxford as he would contagion''What are its advantages to the former' 'Leisure books and learned men and the last benefit would be the greatest were it not publicly discountenanced by the arrogant distance which both the statutes of the university and the practice of the graduates and dignitaries prescribe In my opinion it has another paradoxical kind of advantage to a mind properly prepared the very vice of the place by shewing how hateful it is must be healthful Insolence haughtiness sloth and sensuality daily exhibited if truly seen cannot but excite contempt''You seem to have profited by the lesson'  'Oh there is but little merit in my forbearance I am poor and have not the means I am a servitor and despised or overlooked Those are most exposed to danger who have most money and most credit I have neither' Charmed with his candour our conversation continued he directed me in the college modes and I sent to the Bursar and prevailed on Turl to breakfast with me I understood that he had obtained an exhibition but that having expressed his thoughts too freely on certain speculative points he had incurred the disapprobation of his seniors who considered it as exceedingly impertinent in any man to differ with them in opinion and especially in such a youth  It was now time I should visit the president and we parted This college magistrate had formerly been acquainted with my grandfather and I had strong recommendations to him from my native village he therefore laid aside much of his dignity and questioned me on various  subjects He took but little notice of the reading and knowledge I was ambitious to display but gave me much advice and instruction concerning the college and university discipline necessary to be observed which he very seriously admonished me not to neglect  I endeavoured to find what his opinion concerning Hector Mowbray was and the lord to whom I had been introduced but this he evaded with a caution to me however not to indulge in any imprudent expence  I then mentioned the name of Turl at which he seemed instantly alarmed and replied 'he should be exceedingly sorry if Mr Turl were one of my acquaintance He was a very dangerous young man and had dared not only to entertain but to make known some very heterodox opinions He had even proceeded so far as to declare himself an antitrinitarian and should therefore certainly never receive his countenance neither he nor  any of his connections If he escaped expulsion he would assuredly never obtain his degrees' I was too orthodox myself not to be startled at this intelligence and felt a very severe pang that a young man from whose conversation I had hoped so much should hold such reprobate doctrines I had thought he would prove both an instructive and pleasant companion but I now positively determined to shun his society Of this I informed the president and he highly applauded my resolution  I then proceeded to the ceremony of entering myself of the college and took the oaths that is I subscribed to the thirtynine articles took an oath of allegiance and supremacy an oath to observe the statutes of the university and another to obey every thing that was contained in a certain huge statute book of the college brought out on this occasion which I never saw either before or since To this hour what its contents were is a  thing to me unknown What is still more strange the very persons who oblige you to take these statutebook oaths publickly confess that to obey most of them is impossible They relate to obsolete customs the very means of practising which are wanting Some for example swear to have mass said for the soul of the founder of the college and others though men of good estates swear themselves not worth five pounds per annum Of these particulars however I was ignorant and the whole was hurried over so much in the way of form and without inquiry of any kind that it seemed like the mere dictate of good manners to do what I was bidden  Warned by the information which Turl had communicated and disgusted by what I myself had seen and partaken of I industriously for sometime avoided Hector Mowbray who as it happened was too much engaged in his own pursuits to molest me In about three weeks  however he came to me one morning rallied me in his coarse way asked if I had entered myself of the glums and insisted that I should go with him and take a ride to Abingdon The chaise would be ready in half an hour and he would introduce me to the finest girl in all England Thinking his language equivocal and suspecting his intentions I ventured to ask if she were a modest woman He burst into a loud laugh and exclaimed I shall omit his oaths 'Modest to be sure as modest as any of her sex' This did not satisfy me I continued to interrogate and he to laugh but still swearing there was not a modester woman in all England A strong inclination to take exercise my own active curiosity and the boisterous hawling and obstinacy of Hector at length prevailed and I yielded I walked with him to the inn the chaise was ready and we stepped into it and galloped away  As we were driving on the image of the gentle Olivia rose to my recollection Instantly the thought struck me 'If it should be Why not Who else could it be Oh it must Yes yes' I was soon convinced it could be no other than Olivia the dear the divine Olivia  In less than forty minutes we were at Abingdon and the postillion by Hector's direction drove us on the back of the town till we came to a neat newly painted house at which he was ordered to stop My heart began to beat Hector jumped out and thundered at the door A female threw up the sash looked through the window and instantly drew it down again Alas it was not Olivia  There was some delay the impatient Hector cursed and knocked again and in a little while the door was opened  Hector entered swearing hurried up stairs bad me follow him dashed open the door and a young lady  in a skyblue  ridinghabit with embroidered buttonholes a nosegay in her bosom and a purple cestus round her waistleaped into his arms  I stood in a trance It was she herself That sweet lovely creature who had lost her purse given a draft on her banker and gone to relieve a poor sick relation at Cirencester It was the true and identical Harriet Palmer She that had been so attentive to me had sugared my tea suffered me to sup in her company and been so fearful lest I should be sick by riding backward The innocent soul that had felt her delicacy so much disturbed by the horsegodmother rudeness of the menfellows'Bless me' said I  She had not time to attend to me 'What the dmntn is the matter' said Hector 'Why was not I let in Who have you here''Here' answered the sweet creature 'How can you suppose I have any body here'  There was a watch studded with diamonds lying on the sofa it caught the eye of Mowbray he snatched it up and with a volley of oaths asked'Whose watch is this''Mine' said Harriet Hector looked again 'Yours Set with diamonds A man's gold chain Here's the seal of Lord Saddog His arms engraved on it I thought I saw one of his fellows as we turned the corner'  There was another door to an inner chamber to that Hector with all his force applied his foot A loud laugh was heard within the door opened and out came Lord Saddog in  propria persona  Miss Palmer not knowing what better to do joined his lordship in the forced laugh The surly Hector shewed every propensity to brutal revenge but had only the courage to bully in which art the lord and the lady soon shewed they were as great proficients as himself  As for the feelings of the blooming Harriet and me they were reciprocal we were equally averse to acknowledge each other for acquaintance I did not wish to be proclaimed the dupe of a courtezan nor she to pay back the ten guineas or be sued for a fraud Hector was in no humour to stay and we soon returned to Oxford I ruminating and even laughing now at myself now at him he in high dudgeon and finding his choler and his courage increase in proportion as he was driven farther from danger  CHAP XVI  EDUCATION STILL PROGRESSIVE A WIDOW'S CONTINENCE RELIGIOUS FERVOUR A METHODIST SERMON OLIVIA IN DANGER LOVE DREAMS FANATIC HORRORS PRESENT DISGRACE AND HONOURS DELAYED  DURING the short period of my absence from my native home I had been taught two additional and essential lessons the first that men are not all as good as they might be and the second that I was not quite so wise as I had supposed myself Having once been duped the thought occurred that it was possible I might be duped again and I thus acquired some small degree of what is called worldly caution At once to display one vice and teach another to expose fraud and inspire suspicion is to an unadulterated mind a severe and odious lesson and when repeated too often  is in danger of inculcating a mistake infinitely more pernicious than that of credulity that is a conviction that man is depraved by nature and a total forgetfulness that he is merely the creature of habit and accident  Hitherto I had met disappointment but I had found novelty and though it was not the novelty I expected yet it was invigorating it kept me awake The qualities for which I most valued myself no one indeed seemed to notice But the world was before me I had seen but little of it my own feelings assured me genius and virtue had a real existence and sometime or another I should find them  Among consolatory thoughts the most animating was the recollection of what Turl had said that to the possessor of fortitude and virtue Oxford was a place where study might be most advantageously prosecuted and aided by this cheering  hope I applied myself to books with courage and assiduity  On the subject of reading however my mind had strong contentions with itself poetry and the  belles lettres  Homer Horace Virgil Shakespeare Spenser Milton Dryden Tasso Ariosto Racine Moliere Congreve with a long and countless  et caetera  were continually tempting me to quit the barren pursuits of divinity and law for the study of which I had come to Oxford Yet a sense of duty so far prevailed that I went through a course of the fathers pored over the canonists and made many resolute attacks upon the schoolmen Not only Aristotle but his doctors the irrefragable the angelic or eagleeyed the subtile the illuminated and many more had their peaceful folios vainly disturbed by my researches and my determination to understand what alas in its essence was unintelligible  In the very beginning as it were of these labours an event took place which gave a very serious aspect to my future fortunes though except the first emotions of regret chagrin and surprise at my mother's conduct no present uneasiness to me In despite of his lawsuits my grandfather had left considerable property which it was supposed would descend to me It had indeed the disadvantage of being left under the executorship of a lawyer who represented it to be in a very involved and disorderly state for with respect to my mother though she had immediate possession she declared that agreeably to the intention of the rector her own subsistence excepted she held it only for my use Thus in several of her letters she had affectionately pressed me not to deprive myself of what was necessary to my situation to the appearance of a gentleman or to the support of the family character  For the first two months we punctually wrote to each other once a week 'My dear dear Hugh' was the first phrase in all her letters and 'my kind and good mother' in mine every maternal anxiety was expressed by her and by me every return of filial affection and duty  At length a week came in which I received no letter I was alarmed wrote to express my fears and in a few days was answered by the lawyer that my mother was in good health but was from home on a visit  A month longer passed away in silence at the end of which I wrote to my mother expressing my feelings and fears and requesting an answer under her own hand otherwise I should come myself to see what was the matter  The answer arrived I hastily opened it and began to read It was no longer prefaced with 'my dear dear Hugh' it was what follows  Dear Son  You seem impatient to hear from me and so I sit down to write you an account of something that has happened which perhaps you will think well of I hope you will I am sure you have no reason to think otherwise though when one does things all for the best one is not always best thought of But I dare say you will not think ill of your mother for that would not be dutiful nor at all agreeable to what your poor dear grandfather always taught Nobody can suppose that I am not come to years of discretion and you very well know I have always been a good and tender mother to you and so I always shall be and I am sure you will not think hardly and improperly of my conduct in any way for that would be very unkind and unbecoming and if I have done all for the best to be hardly thought of afterward would be  very improper indeed Mr Thornby the lawyer is a very prudent man and so I have acted by his advice which you may well think cannot be wrong and his nephew Mr Wakefield is a gentleman that nobody need be ashamed of owning and so since you must be told you may as well be told at first as at lastI am married which I hope and expect you will think was a very prudent thing I am sure when you come to know Mr Wakefield you will like him prodigiously He sends his kind blessing to you and so I remain  your ever loving mother JANE WAKEFIELD  Little as I was attached to personal interest or fearful of being left without a provision I own this letter electrified me Was this the tone of affection Had it vanished so instantly After such strong and reiterated professions for my sake never to have a second husband not only to marry  but to cool intirely toward me and to be only anxious in a poor selfish circumlocutory apology for a conduct which she herself felt to be highly reprehensible  The lawyer too His nephew Not satisfied with the executorship he had engulphed the whole in his family the stipend of a hundred a year while I remained at college and a thousand pounds for the purchase of an advowson when I should leave it excepted I wondered on reflection that he should even have advised the rector to this but it was by affecting disinterestedness that he could most effectually secure the remainder  But the pain these thoughts occasioned was neither debilitating nor durable My sanguine selfconfidence though sometimes apalled has all my life prevented me from being subject to fits of permanent chagrin or melancholy The recollection of my mother's passionate promises  the shortness of the time the suddenness of the change the family into which she had married and the instability of a woman that was my mother drew a few sighs from me and in these my gloom evaporated I returned cheerfully to my books and determined to visit home no more but while a student to make Oxford my home and not incur the frequently wellmerited reproach of being  a termtrotter  As for my companion Hector whatever the intentions of the Squire his father might be he considered Oxford only as a place of dissipation and loved it for nothing but because he was here first let entirely loose and here first found comrades that were worthy to be his peers Most of his time was now spent in London or in parties such as himself and his intimates planned I suffered little interruption from him he now and then indeed gave me an indolent call  but as there was no parity of pursuit nor unity of sentiment between us there could be but little intercourse  Little farther remarkable happened during the three years and ten months of my residence in this city except the incident that occasioned my removal By being a constant spectator of the debauchery of the young and the sensuality of the old I conceived an increasing dislike of their manners and sought the company of a few secluded young men who like myself were severe students Toward the close of this period I became acquainted with some who were tinged with methodism and by frequently listening to their conversation my thoughts were turned into the same channel The want of zeal in prayer and every part of religious duty the tedious and dull sermons heard in the churches and what methodists call preaching themselves and not their Saviour  were the frequent topics of our animadversion  This was a doctrine most aptly calculated to inflame an imagination like mine which was ardent and enthusiastic Beside it relieved me from a multitude of labours and cares for as I proceeded Thomas Aquinas and his subtilizing competitors were thrown by in contempt I had learned divinity by inspiration and soon believed myself fit for a reformer The philosopher Aristotle with his dialectics and sophisms were exchanged for those of the philosopher Saint Paul from whom I learnt that he who had saving faith had every thing and that he who wanted it was naked of all excellence as the new born babe This nakedness I had discovered in myself and in the language of the sect was immediately clothed in the righteousness of Christ Jesus I in common with my methodistical brethren was chosen of the elect My name was inscribed in the  book of life never to be erased My sins were washed away Satan had no power over me and to myself and my new fraternity I applied the text that 'the gates of hell could not prevail against us'  To these mysteries which all the initiated allow are suddenly unfolded descending like lightening by the inspiration of the spirit and illuminating the darkened soul to these mysteries no man perhaps was ever a more sudden or a more combustible kind of convert than myself I beamed with gospel light it shone through me I was the beacon of this latter age a comet sent to warn the wicked I mean I was all this in my own imagination which swelled and mounted to the very acme of fanaticism  Under the impulse of these wild dreams in which my soul delighted I was sometimes tempted to rise up a prophet preach salvation to the poor and confound the wise Persecution I must expect  but in that I should glory it was the badge of blessedness the mark of election the signing of the covenant Elevated to these celestial heights with what contempt did I look down on the doctors proctors and preachers of Baal for such were all the unenlightened and on their dignities paraphernalia and many coloured robes What were these but the types of Babylon the ensigns of the scarlet whore the purple tokens of the beast In the most extravagant eccentricities of mind it is remarkable what a mixture there is of truth and falsehood and how nearly and frequently they approach each other  During the height of this paroxysm a famous gospel preacher a divine man on his way from Shropshire to London came to hold forth in the vicinity of Oxford not in churches they were shut upon him but in the fields not to the rich not to the worldly wise not to the self righteous they were deaf but to  the poor in spirit to the polluted the hardened reprobate who wished by faith and repentance though dyed in sin like scarlet to be washed white as wool To hear this teacher of the word who set up his stool near a village on the Witney road I repaired I and many a moaning old woman beside watchful with our chorus of amen and our sobs and groans at every divine ejaculation to aid the heaving motions of the spirit and take heaven by storm  The elect were assembled and with them a greater number of the unconverted heads were uncovered a hymn was sung and a long extempore string of intercessions praying that the Lord would lay bare his arm and strike the guilty with terror that Christ crucified would be among them that they might be washed in the blood of the immaculate lamb and that the holy spirit would breathe the Godman Jesus into all hearts with many more absurdities was uttered  The preacher then took his text and chose for his subject the casting the buyers and sellers out of the temple This was an opportunity not to be lost by me A gospel minister was indeed a  rara avis  at Oxford I therefore took out my utensils and very industriously wrote notes that the divine breathings of the man of God might not be lost upon me'Buyers and sellers' said he 'you must be cast out The tables of the money changers must be overthrown you have defiled the temple of the Saviour In what do you trade In vanity In gold silver iron brass houses corn cattle goods and chattels But gold and silver may be stolen iron will rust brass will break cattle will die corn will mildew houses will burn they will tumble about your ears Repent or you will quickly bring an old house over your heads Your goods and chattels will but kindle the fire in which you are to burn everlastingly What are  your occupations Why to hoard and sell your souls for gain that your heirs may squander and buy a hot place in hell I am not one of your fashionable fine spoken mealy mouthed preachers I tell you the plain truth What are your pastimes Cards and dice fiddling and dancing guzzling and guttling Can you be saved by dice No Will the four knaves give you a passport to heaven No Can you fiddle yourself into a good birth among the sheep No You are goats and goat like you may dance yourselves to damnation You may guzzle wine here but you shall want a drop of water to cool your tongue hereafter You may guttle while righteous Lazarus is lying at your gate But wait a little He shall soon lie in Abraham's bosom while you shall roast on the devil's great gridiron and be seasoned just to his toothWill the prophets say "Come here gamester and teach us the long odds"'Tis odds if they  doWill the martyrs rant and swear and shuffle and cut with you No The martyrs are no shufflers You will be cut so as you little expect you are a field of tares and Lucifer is your head farmer He will come with his reapers and his sickles and his forks and you will be cut down and bound and pitched and carted and housed in hell I will not oil my lips with lies to please you I tell you the plain truth you will go to hell Ammon and Mammon and Moloch are head stoakers they are making Bethhoron hot for you Prophane wretches you daily wrangle and brawl and tell one another"I will see you damned first But I tell you the day will come when you will pray to Beelzebub to let you escape his clutches And what will be his answer"I will see you damned first"  To this rhapsody of strange but impressive vulgar eloquence I listened with rapture for nearly an hour selecting  and noting down the passages that I thought most remarkable many of which were too extravagant if repeated to be believed In the height of these effusions when the divine man was torturing his lungs to be heard by the increasing croud he on his stool I seated uncapped in a cart by his side who should I see approach in a phaeton and pair but Hector Mowbray And by his side YesOlivia The beauteous Olivia no longer a child but tall straight perfectly formed every limb in the most captivating symmetry every feature in the full bloom of youth intelligence in every look grace in every motion sweetness in every smile Attracted by curiosity her brother arrested his course drew up and placed the celestial vision full in view  Oh frailty of the flesh My new made garb of righteousness dropped from my shoulders The old Adam that had been dead in me again revived the  workings of the spirit ceased I gazed on an apparition which was indeed heavenly and forgot the apostles the prophets and the martyrs The preacher himself was heard no more nor more would have been heard had he not with all the effrontery of a fanatic interrupted his discourse to address himself personally to Hector and Olivia by which he excited sensations in me that were wholly unexpected 'Jehu driveth furiously' said he 'but Jezebel was given to the dogs My choler instantly began to rise Sinners drive not so fast The way is broad and Tophet is gaping where is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth You will be there poor lost souls sooner than you expect The way to heaven is narrow much too narrow for your large consciences and though the court is spacious the gate is too little for you to drive in with your coaches and six No not even your vis a vis nor your phaetons neither not so  much as a tumbril or a buggie can get past But perhaps you think to ride up to the gate and there to cry  peccavi  and that then it will open and you will be admitted But no no I tell you no You shall never be able to utter more than  pec pec pec  and while with your mouths open you are stammering and stuttering to get out  cavi  Satan and his blackguards shall come and peck you even as crows peck carrion Yes Jehu and Jezebel Remember I give you warning'  If I one of the preacher's disciples could scarcely refrain from falling upon him for his insolence what must the choleric and brutal Hector feel hearing himself repeatedly laughed at by the delighted unmannerly mob during this impudent harangue He dropped the reins jumped from the phaeton sprang through the croud and began to horsewhip the inspired man in the most furious manner  And now an accident happened which of all others that I can remember gave me the most terror Olivia sat alone in the phaeton the reins were loose and the fighting shouting and uproar of the divided mob occasioned the horses to take fright They snorted kicked and set off full speed with the helpless Olivia screaming for aid The moment Hector left the carriage I saw what was likely to happen leaped from the cart where I sat and flew like lightening after the frantic animals Few men were swifter of foot than I was but they had the start and were on the full gallop The danger was imminent On one side of the road was a gravel pit on the other the river and before them was a bridge the walls of which were not breast high A cart was passing the bridge and the mad horses still on full speed ran on the wrong side dashed the phaeton against the cart overturned it and threw Olivia over the wall into the river  The freshes had lately come down and the stream was both deep and strong I was at the foot of the bridge when she fell and when I reached the place she was still above water and had passed the arch on the other side I instantly stripped off my coat cap and gown sprang into the eddy made a few strokes and as happy fortune would have it just caught her as she was sinking  Loaded with this precious burden I had the strength of twenty men I stemmed the current and presently brought her into shallow water where I could find footing I then bore her into the nearest house and every possible aid was immediately administered  While I was thus employed Hector arrived his rage boiling over anew at his lamed horses and broken phaeton for his inquiries concerning his sister were short as soon as he understood that she was not drowned I paid as little attention to him as he did to her and was  disturbed only by my fears lest the  ig  should be productive of fever or still worse consequences  Olivia had too much sincerity of heart and too great a desire to remove the anxiety of those around her to be guilty of the least affectation She had received no injury for the danger being over her mind was too strong not to dispel her fears and after reposing an hour and finding herself perfectly well she insisted on coming down and joining us at dinner Her thanks to me in words were not profuse but they were emphatical 'She was alive and should never forget that she owed that life to me' This she three times repeated once at table again in the post chaise in which we returned to Oxford and once more when we took leave of each other in the evening  To me this day was indeed a day of tumult Nothing perhaps more aptly prepares the mind for the passion of love than religious enthusiasm The subject  of my conversation with Olivia was chiefly a revival of former times which seemed to be remembered by us mutually with glowing regret as the happiest moments of our existence times which I inwardly dreaded might never return  Fanatical reveries excepted this perhaps was the first desponding thought I had known at least it was the first I can distinctly remember and the pang that accompanied it was severe Olivia was so lovely her form so enchanting her manners so captivating that my eyes were riveted on her my soul absorbed and the faculty of thinking arrested Every look of her beaming eyes penetrated to the heart every motion of her moist coral lips gave exstacy and every variation of her features discovered new ineffable and angelic beauties  Why did the hours sly Why was the day so short She had only passed through Oxford in her way to London and was to depart in the morning I would  gladly have persuaded her to regard her health and not expose herself so soon after the fright but in vain She felt no malady nor would acknowledge any and the selfish Hector was rather inclined to hurry her off than invite her to stay It was years since I had seen her and to be torn thus suddenly from bliss unutterable Never had I felt a pang like this before  In the evening returned to my chamber and left in solitude I sat with my arms folded disconsolate motionless and in a profound but yet a most active trance I remained thus for hours ardently thinking on Olivia recollecting every incident of my past life in which she had had the least part placing all her divine perfections full in view and unable to detach my mind one moment from the beatific vision  At length by accident I cast my eye on two books that lay on the mantlepiece before me Baxter's Call to the Unconverted  and the History of Francis Spira two of the most terrific productions to such a mind at such a moment that ever the ravings of fanaticism sent forth The impulse was irresistible I opened them read and all the horror of hell came upon me I was a backslider Perdition was certain All the torments that Baxter d  scribed were devouring me and my soul was sinking like the so  l of Francis Spira into sulphu  eous flames there to howl and be eternally tormented by the malignant mo  ks and mows of inexorable fiends I have since suffered many evils or what are called evils and have known misfortunes such as are supposed to be of the severest kind but of all the nights of my life not one can equal this I fell on my knees and attempted to pray but imagined the ear of mercy shut and that I beheld the wicked one stand ready to seize and fly away with me My teeth began to gnash as if by irresistible impulse  my hair stood an end and large drops of sweat f  ll from my face The eternal damnation of which I had read and heard so much seemed inevitable till at last in a torrent of phrenzy which I had not the power to controul I began to blaspheme believing myself to be already a fiend  It is by such horrible imagery that so many of the disciples of methodism have become maniacs  My dereliction of intellect fortunately was but of short duration overpowered and exhausted I at length sunk to sleep my head leaning on the bed and I kneeling by its side How long I remained thus I cannot tell but I awoke in a shivering fit from a dream of terror and found myself in the dark I hastily undressed myself got into bed and shrunk beneath the bed clothes as if escaping from Satan whom imagination once more placed at my elbow in forms inexpressibly horrid  The visions of the night had left too deep an impression not to be in part revived in the morning Tho  ghts however that had lately escaped me were now called to recollection I remembered having once believed that God was the God of mercy that for him to delight in the torture of lost souls was impossible and that I had even doubted of the eternity of future torments To this relief a more effectual one was added Olivia could not be forgotten and my thoughts by being continually attracted and fixed on her were relieved from despair which might otherwise have been fatal  A week passed away in such kind of convulsive meditations my attachment to methodism daily declining and at last changing into something like aversion and horror At the end of this period I was sent for in the morning by the president The incident was alarming I had broken no college rules neglected no prayers nor been guilty of any indecorum  I foreboded that he had heard of my methodistical excursion The conjecture was true he told me it was too publicly known to be passed over in silence that the character of the university had greatly suffered by this kind of heresy that the vice chancellor proctors and heads of houses had been consulted and that the gentlest punishment they could inflict was rustication for two terms It would have been much more severe he said but for the respect he bore to the memory of my grandfather who had been a doctor of the university a worthy pillar of the church and his good friend  Though I suspected my opinions I was not so entirely convinced as openly to renounce them and I remained silent when he required me to recant But I requested him to tell me how the event had become public Not a gownsman was present except Hector Mowbray and surely he was above the character of  an informer Especially thought I in this instance The president however was silent I was suffered to suppose what I pleased and I left him with the sentence of rustication confirmed and my long expected academical honours deferred The only favour granted me was that the punishment should not be made public  CHAP XVII  DISAPPOINTMENT MORE MARRIAGE ACCIDENTS PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY  THE delay of two terms was by no means pleasing to me I had nearly waited the stipulated time had read  wall lectures  and had  done juraments  and  generals  Aristotle had been laid upon my head and I had been created  a Soph  In fine I had complied with all the forms of the university forms which once  perhaps might have had a meaning but which are now offensively absurd I expected the next term to have obtained the degree of bachelor of arts after which it was my intention to have gone to London there to have been ordained and to have sought a flock wanting a pastor on whom the stores of my theology and the powers of my elocution might have been well bestowed  Traversed in this design I determined to repair to the great city immediately and return to keep my terms at Oxford when the period of rustication should have elapsed But I had been obliged to furnish myself with books and music and had found the hundred pounds a year allowed me scarcely sufficient and beside the charges of travelling and removal I was informed that London was an expensive place It was therefore necessary I should write to the country for a supply The correspondence with my mother though not pursued with all the  zeal in which it was begun had been occasionally continued At fir  t her letters abounded with eulogiums on her husband but the subject afterward began to cool with her and she had lately forborne even to mention his name In answer to the letters which I wrote to inform her and lawyer Thornby of my plan and to request a supply a part of the truth appeared Her husband was a young man who coming sooner into the possession of money than of good sense had squandered as much of it as he could wrest from his uncle the lawyer who affirmed the whole or nearly the whole was wasted and when he could obtain no more had left her to depend on Thornby's bounty and had gone to London  These disagreeable circumstances were in part communicated by my mother and in part by Thornby who had written to tell me that if a small advance were made it must be deducted from the  thousand pounds bequeathed as before mentioned To this I willingly agreed and giving him all the legal security he required I received fifty pounds after which I made the necessary preparations for my intended journey and obtained letters of recommendation to a clergyman in London and to the Bishop of to whom when I should have taken my bachelor's degree I meant to apply for deacon's orders  END OF VOL I
