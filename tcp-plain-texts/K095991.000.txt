SQUIRE GROOM  LAWYER  SERVANT  CHARLOTTE  LOVE ALAMODE A COMEDY  ACT I SCENE I  Enter  Sir Theodore  and  Charlotte  Sir  Theo  WHAT will the world say of me but that I was a very prudent man  Charl  The World the world will applaud you especially when they know what sort of lovers they are and that the sole motive of their affection is the Ladies fortune No poor girl sure was ever plagued with such a brood as I amThe first upon my list is a high minded Northbritish Knight who sets up for a wit a man of learning and sentiment He bears himself fair while you are present but abuses the whole world when their backs are turn'd and withal has so high a notion of the dignity of his family that he would no doubt think he laid me under a great obligation in honouring me with his handThe second is a downright ideot a fluttering frivolous thing well known in most public places by the name of Beau Mordecai an English Jew The next in Cupid's train is your Nephew whose Irish voice and military aspect make me fancy that he was not only born in a siege but that Belona alone cou'd be his nurse Mars his preceptor and the camp the acadamy where he receiv'd the first rudiments of his education  Sir  Theo  My dear Charlotte you should not be so severe upon my Nephew what can you expect from a mere rough hewn soldier who must needs go from his  friends a volunteer and has lived these several years within the circuit of a camp so that I don't believe he has six ideas distinct from his profession  Charl  Let me see his name is  Sir  Theo  Sir Callogan O'Bralagan  Charl  Sir Callaghan O'Brallagan It is enough to choak meIf I have him I must have an Irish interpreter to make me understand what he says  Sir  Theo  Well I must go and see about your suit the coach waitsThey all dine here I think  Charl  All but Squire Groom and he is to ride a match that I suppose no charms could perswade him to be absent from  Sir  Theo  Well make yourself what sport you please with themI shall certainly be back to dinner Goodmorrow to you my dear  Exit  Theo  Mordecai without  Sir Theodore your servantIs Miss Charlotte this way  Sir  Theo  She is Sir Goodmorrow to you  Mordecai  You'll dine

Charl  Not so fast Mr Mordecai you are very gallant Sir and I protest I never saw you better drest  Mord  It is well enough Madam just as my taylor fancies do you like it  Charl  Oh it is quite elegent but if I mistake not you are so remarkable for a taste in dress that you are known all over the City by the name of the ChangeAlley Beau  Mord  They do distinguish me by that title but I declare I have not the vanity to think I deserve it  Charl  Oh Mr Mordecai well remembred I heard of your amour at the Opera with Miss Sprightly  Mord  Dear Madam how can you be so severe That the lady has designs I stedfastly believe but as for meBut pray Madam who told you so  Charl  Sir Archy Macsarcasm  Mord  Oh what a creature have you nam'd the very abstract of filth and nastiness he takes such a quantity of Scotch snuff that he smells worse than a Tallow Chandlers shop in the dogdays there is not one word of truth out of five that he says and he utters his similies with all the gravity imaginable after the moderate allowance of four bottles of port three ounces of Scotch snuff and twelve pipes of tobacco  Charl  What a character has he drawn of the knight  Mord  Why Madam I vow to Gad he is the daily sport of every coffeehouse in town all his own countrymen of any character constantly avoid him and Oh the devil here he comes  Sir  Archy  without  Sawny bid Donald bring the chariot at aught o'clock exactly  Enter Sir  Archy  Mordecai  My dear knight I am sincerly glad to see you and have the honour at all times and upon all occasions to be your most obedient humble

your ladyship has been entertain'd vera weel by my friend Mordecai before I broke in upon you he's a guid ane at a tale when the stocks is at one end and the lottery at the ither ha ha ha But ye maun

like the monarchs of auld I never travel without my fuil he is as good as a Comedy or a Farce but he has made a Jargon which he stiles asonnet upon his bewitching Charlotte as he calls you madam he is now altering it and ye mann expect sic an epistle as has na' been pen'd sin' the days of Don Qixote You have heard him sing it Mordecai  Mord  I beg your pardon Sir Archy I have heard him roar it Egad we have had him just now madam at a tavern and made him give it us in an Irish bowl that might be heard from here to West Chester  Sir  Archy  Why Mordecai you have a devilish deal of wit man ay that's what ye hae  Mord  Your most obedient Sir Archy I am afraid you flatter me but I must be goingMadam I kiss your hands  Charl  You are not going to leave us Mr Mordecai  Mord  Only to have a slice of Sir Callaghan before dinner by way of a whet that's all madam only by way of a whet  Sir  Archy  Not a word of the sonnet man  Mord  Never fear Sir Archy never fear  Exit  Mordecai  Sir  Archy  What a fantastical Baboon this little Israelite makes of himself  Charl  He is very entertaining Sir Archy  Sir  Archy  The follow's vera ridiculous and therefore vera usefu' in society for wharever he gangs there maun be laughter but now madam a word or twa to our ain mattersMadam I lov√® you and gin I didna I wad scorn to say itconcerning these creatures wha call themselves your lovers there are three of them about your ladyship's person as unfit for you as a wandering Arab and whase sentiments are as wide o' true felicity as the north and south poles Reptiles and beggars wha can boast of naething but a knowledge of sic things as wad mak 'um be kend by aw judicious e'en as the outcasto' the warld And first this Mordecai to be sure the fellow's wealthy yes he's wealthy but then a reptile Madam he's a reptile whase common place notions are o' nae farther extent than Changealley or the Coffeehouses and whase only ideas are cent per cent schemes stocks annuities and south sea bubbles  Charl  Ay Sir Archy you are above such groveling thoughtsYour ambition is to adorn your mind  Sir  Archy  Then madam as to squire Groom to be sure he's a great sportsman but he's a beggarA beggar and nae doubt but your fortune would be very acceptable'Twould enable him to redeem his stead o' horses put him on his legs again and according till his ain phrase he would be bottom madam he would be bottom but in a few years madam your whole fortune the wise scraping of your ancestors would be wantonly squandered away upon cockfighting horseracing grooms jockeys and siclike spendthrift amusements and your ladyship not hae a blanket left to cover you Then as to Sir Callaghan O'Brallaghan the fellow's  well enough to laugh at but ye maun look about you there for your guardian is his uncle and to my certain knowledge there is a design upon your fortune in that quarter depend upon it there is a design upon your fortune  Charl  I believe indeed a lady's fortune is the principal object of every lover  Sir  Archy  I grant ye madam wi' Sir Calloghan O'Bralaghan Squire Groom and siclike fallows but men of honour have ither principles I assure ye madam 'tis not for the pecuniary but for the divine graces o' your mind and the mental perfections of your soul and body which are more to me than all the riches of Peru and Mexico  Charl  O Sir Archy  Sir  Archy  Besides madam gin ye marry me ye will marry a man of sobriety and oeconomyIt is true I am not in the heyday of my bluid yet far frae the vale of years as the poet saysI am nor like the young Whipsters of this age wha are aw spirits at the first onset but gang aff like a squi  or a cracker on a rejoicing night and are never heard o' mairThe young men now adays madam are mere baubles absolute baubles  Charl  Now I think old men Sir Archy are but baubles  Sir  Archy  Besides madam consider the dignity and antiquity of our family Madam in our family there are three Viscounts four barons six earls seven marquisses and two dukes the families of the south arena to be compared to families of the northThere is as muckle difference as between a hound of blood and a mongrel  Charl  And why so sir  Sir  Archy  I'll tell you madam the noblility of Scotland are aw descended frae renowned warriors and heroes of glorious atchievements wha disdain'd to mak alliances or contaminate their bluid wi' ony that were na' as great as their ain But here in the south ye o' the south ye are aw sprung frae naething in the warld  but wool packs hop sacks sugar kists tar barrels and rum puncheons  Charl  Ha ha ha  Sir  Archy  What gars you laugh madam  Charl  The opinion you have of our nobility  Sir  Archy  Guid troth madam its true aw we families of the north are of another kidney than ye o' the south We are of another kidney quite we disdain a mixture of bluid that is na' as pure as our ain Whereas here ye are a strange amphibious breed being a composition of Turks Jews Nabobs and Refugees  Charl  We are indeed a strange mixture Sir Archy  Sir  Archy  Vera true vera true my family is a family of rank and consequence which if ye marry into will purify your blood and refine it frae the lees and draps of trade with which it is contaminated which your money cannot do for you were it as meikle as the bank of Edinburgh  Enter  Mordecai  Mord  Sir Archy he is just without he is coming  Sir  Calloghan  without  Is the lady this way do you say young man  Servant  She is Sir  Sir  Call  Then I'll trouble you with no farther ceremony  Enters  Madam I am your most obedient humble servant  Charl  I am very sorry to hear we shall soon be depriv'd of your company Sir Calloghan I thought the war in Germany had been all over  Sir  Call  Yes madam it was all over but it began again a soldier never lives in quiet till he has nothing to do then he quits the field with more safety  Sir  Archy  The lady was just saying she would be glad if you would favour her with a slight narrative of what happen'd in Germany  Sir  Call  Pray madam don't ax me I am afraid it would look like gasconading in me and I will assure you there is no such thing in nature as giving a description of a fiery battle for there is so much done every where that no body knows what is done any where Then  there is such drumming and trumpeting and such delightful confusion altogether that you can no more give an account of it than you can of the stars in the sky  Sir  Archy  It is a vera good account he gives of it  aside to Mordecai  Let us smoke him and see if we can get a little fun with himTry if he will give you some account of the battle  Mord  Pray Sir Calloghan how many might you kill in any one battle you have been at  Sir  Call  starting  I'll tell you I generally kill more in a battle than a coward would chuse to look upon or than an impertinent fellow would be able to eat Are you answer'd Mr Mordecai  Sir  Archy  You was devilish sharp upon him faith  Mord  Wasn't I  Sir  Archy  Yes but have another cut at himThe Israelite will bring himself intil a damn'd scrap  Aside  Mord  Sir Calloghan give me leave to tell you if I was a general  Sir  Call  A general upon my soul and you would make a fine generalOh madam look upon the generalMr Mordecai do not look upon being a general as so light a matter It is a very difficult trade to learn to be able to rejoice with danger on the one side and death on the other and a great many more things that you know no more of than I do of being high priest to a synagogue so hold your tongue my dear Mr Mordecai about that and go mind your Cent per Cent and your lottery tickets in ChangeAlley  Sir  Archy  A'ha ha By the Lord he has tickled up the Israelite he has given it to the Moabite on baith sides o' the head  Charl  But you have been frequently in danger sir  Sir  Call  Danger madam is the soldiers profession and death his best reward  Mord  A bull a bull pray how do you make that out you say death is the soldiers best reward  Sir  Call  I'll tell you how a general dead in the field of battle is a monument of fame that makes him as much alive as Caeser or Alexander or any dead heroe  of them all and when the History of America comes to be written there is your brave young general that died in the battle before Quebec will be alive to the end of the world  Charl  True Sir Calloghan the actions of that day will be remember'd while Britain or British gratitude have a name  Sir  Archy  Wha was it did the business at Quebec Oh the Highlanders bore the bell that day Had you but seen them with their Andrew Ferraras how they cut them and slash'd them about they did the business and gain'd imortal fame upon the spot  Sir  Call  Sir Archy give me your hand I assure you your countrymen are brave soldiers and so are mine too  Charl  I think I hear Sir Theodore's coach stop  Enter  Servant  Serv  Madam Sir Theodore waits for you and dinner is almost ready  Exit  Mord  Madam will you honour me with the tip of your wedding fingerAdieu Sir CalloghanSir Archy your servantAdieu Sir Calloghan  Exeunt  Charlotte  and  Mordecai  Sir  Call  A very impudent fellow this Mr Mordecai if it had not been for the Lady I would have been a little upon the Cavee with him  Sir  Archy  Because the rascal has been let into our company at Bath he intrudes upon you wherever you go but have you written the letter to the lady  Sir  Call  Faith I have not for I thought it would not be right to make my addresses to the lady till I had made my affections known to her guardian so I have indited the letter to him  Sir  Archy  That's right that's right for so as ye do but write it matters not to whomBut where is it  Sir  Call  Here it is  Sir  Archy  I warrant 'tis a bonny epistle  Sir  Call  Reads  SIR As I have the honour to bear the character of a soldier and to call Sir Theodore Goodchild uncle I do not think it would be consistent  for a man of honour to behave like a scoundrel  Sir  Archy  That's an excellent remark an excellent remark and vera new  Sir  Call  Therefore I thought proper before I proceeded any further for I have done nothing as yet to open my mind to you before I gain the affections of the lady  You see Sir Archy I was for carrying on my approaches like a soldier Alamilitaire as we say abroad  You are sensible my family is as old as any in the three kingdoms and older too I shall therefore come to the point at once  You see I have given him a little rub by way of a hint about our family because Sir Theodore is a bit of a relation by the mother'sside only which is a little upstart family that came in with one strong bow t' other day not above six or seven hundred years ago Now my father's family are all related to the O'Strickesses the O'Cannakans the O'Calloghans and I myself am an O'Bralaghan which is the oldest of them all  Sir  Archy  Yes Sir I beleive ye are of a very ancient family but ye're out in ae point  Sir  Call  What's that Sir Arcy  Sir  Archy  Why sir where ye said ye was as auld as ony family in the three kingdoms  Sir  Call  Why then I said no more than is true Sir Archy  Sir  Archy  Hout awa' man ye dinna consider the families o' the north ye of Hibernia are as low as the bushy bramble wha took refuge frae a' corners in that wild spot where ye liv'd pen'd up like a set of outcasts and as such you remain until this hour  Sir  Call  I beg your pardon Sir Archy that's the Scotch account which never speaks truth because it is partial but the Irish account which must be true because it was written by one of my own family says the Scotch are all Irishmens bastards  Sir  Archy  Bastards what do ye make us illegitimateillegitimate Sir  Sir  Call  Why little Ference Flaerty O'Bralaghan was the man who went over from Carrickfergus and peopled all Scotland with his own hands  Sir  Archy  Sir Calloghan tho' your ignorance and vanity would make ravishers of your ancestors and harlots and sabines of our mothers yet ye shall find in me  Sir  Call  Harkee Sir Archy what was that you said just now about ignorance and vanity  Sir  Archy  Sir I denounce you baith ignorant and vain and mak your maist o'd  Sir  Call  Faith I can make nothing at all of it because they are not words that a gentleman is us'd to therefore you must unsay them again  Sir  Archy  How sir eat my words a North Britain eat his words  Sir  Call  By my soul you must and that immediately  Sir  Archy  Sir you shall eat a piece of my weapon first    Draws    Sir  Call  Put up for shame Sir Archy Consider drawing a sword is a very serious piece of business and should be done in private  Sir  Archy  Defend yourself for by the sacred Cross of St Andrew I'll have satisfaction for making us illegitimate  Sir  Call  Now by the Cross of St Patrick you are a very foolish man but if you have a mind for a little of that sport come away to the right spot  Sir  Archy  No equivocation sir dinna think you have gotten Beaux Mordecai to cope with  Sir  Call  Come on then for the honour the sod Oh you are as welcome as the flowers in May    they fight    Enter  Charlotte  Charl  For heaven's sake what's the matter what is all this about  Sir  Call  It is about Sir Archy's greatgrandmother madam  Carl  Sir Archy's greatgrandmother  Sir  Archy  Madam he has cast an affront upon a hail nation  Sir  Call  I am sure if I did it was more than I intended it was only to prove the antiquity of my family  Charl  Pray let me make peace between you  Sir  Archy  Sir as ye say ye didna intend the affront I am satisfied  Sir  Call  Sir Archy there are two things I am always afraid of the one is of being affronted myself and the other of affronting any man  Charl  A very generous disposition Sir Calloghan but I hope this afair is over  Sir  Archy  I am satisfied madam but let me tell you Sir Calloghan as a friend as a friend man you should never enter into disputes about history literature or antiquity of families for you have got such a cursed wicked jargon upon your tongue  Sir  Call  Oh I beg your pardon Sir Archy 'tis you have got such a damn'd twist of Scotch brogue that you don't understand good English when I speak it  Sir  Archy  Very weel very weel but you are out again for every body kens that I speak the south country dialect sae weel that wharever I gang I am always taken for an Englishmanbut we'll appeal to the lady which of us twa has the brogue  Sir  Call  With all my heartPray madam have I the brogue  Charl  No sir  Sir  Call  I am sure I never could perceive it  Charl  Neither have a brogue neither you both speak very good EnglishBut come dinner waits gentlemen  Sir  Call  We'll follow you madam  Charl  Pray don't be long  Exit  Charl  Sir  Archy  Weel now dinna gie o'er the design of the letter  Sir  Call  Sir Archy never fear me for as the old song goes  You never did hear  Of an Irishman's fear  In love or in battle  In love or in battel  We're always on duty  And ready for beauty  Tho' cannons do rattle  Tho' cannons do rattle  By day and by night  We love and we fight  We're honour's defenders  We're honour's defenders  The foe and the fair  We always take care  To make them surrender  To make them surrender  Exeunt  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  Enter Sir  Archy  and  Charlotte  Sir  Archy  WAUNS madam step intil us for a few minutes you will crack your sides with laughingWe hae gotten anither fool come to divert us unexpectedly

guid that is guid I thought it would come to action ha ha that's clear we sal hae ane o' them pink'd  Mord  O madam the challenge need not terrify you 'tis only in halfpints of claret to your ladyships health  Charl  Lord Mr Mordecai how can you startle one so  Sir  Archy  I am very sorry for that guid troth I was in hopes they had a mind to show their prowess before the lady their mistress or that we should hae a little Irish or Newmarket bloodspilt But what was the cause of the challenge madam  Mord  Why their passion for this lady till the dispute rising high they determined

all at fault is this true Sir Theodore  Zounds I hear that you and the filly both run a wrong side the post  Sir  Theo  Squire this is no time to joke and triffle On so serious and severely affecting a stroke to make an attempt to disguise our feelings However Sir this is a charming girl whose virtues deserve a noble fortune but the loss of it will surely make no abatement in your affections

thought fit to make happy the first of families but by my ill conduct and want of care her fortune is lost abroad which I had ventured in trade and the law suit lost at homeTherefore her virtue not fortune must now be the object of your affections  Sir  Call  I assure you sir Theodore I rejoice at her distressfor when she was rich I approach'd her with fear and trembling because I was not her equal But now she is poor and has nobody to defend her I fell something warm about my heart that tells me I love her better than when I thought she was rich and if my life and fortune will be of any service to her she shall command them for ever and ever  Charl  Generous man  Sir  Theo  And will you take her for life  Sir  Call  Ay and for death too which is a great deal longer than life you know

acceptance take her as a reward for your disinterested affection  Sir  Call  Take herthe devil take me if I don't  Charl  And I yield sir to your disposal with unfeigned pleasure  Sir  Call  By the
