Romans languished under the ignominious tyranny of eunuchs and bishops the praises of Julian were  The jealousy of Constantius against Julian  repeated with transport in every part of the empire except in the palace of Constantius The Barbarians of Germany had felt and still dreaded the arms of the young Caesar his soldiers were the companions of his victory the grateful provincials enjoyed the blessings of his reign but the favourites who had opposed his elevation were offended by his virtues and they justly considered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court As long as the fame  of Julian was doubtful the buffoons of the palace who were skilled in the language of satire tried the efficacy of those arts which they had so often practised with success They easily discovered that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation the ridiculous epithets of an hairy savage of an ape invested with the purple were applied to the dress and person of the philosophic warrior and his modest dispatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious Greek a speculative soldier who had studied the art of war amidst the groves of the academy  Omnes qui plus poterant in palatio adulandi professores jam docti recte consulta prospereque completa vertebant in deridiculum talia sine modo strepentes insulse in odium venit cum victoriis suis capella non homo ut hirsutum Julianum carpentes appellantesque loquacem talpam et purpuratam simiam et litterionem Graecum et his congruentia plurima atque vernacula principi resonantes audire haec taliaque gestienti virtutes ejus obruere verbis impudentibus conabantur ut segnem incessentes et timidum et umbratilem gestaque secus verbis comptioribus exornantem Ammianus xvii  The voice of malicious folly was at length silenced by the shouts of victory the conqueror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longer be painted as an object of contempt and the monarch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing from his lieutenant the honourable reward of his labours In the letters crowned with laurel which according to ancient custom were addressed to the provinces the name of Julian was omitted  Constantius had made his dispositions in person  he  had signalized his valour in the foremost ranks  his  military  conduct had secured the victory and the captive king of the Barbarians was presented to  him  on the field of battle  from which he was at that time distant above forty days journey  Ammian xvi The orator Themistius iv p believed whatever was contained in the Imperial letters which were addressed to the senate of Constantinople Aurelius Victor who published his Abridgment in the last year of Constantius ascribes the German victories to the  wisdom  of the emperor and the  fortune  of the Caesar Yet the historian soon afterwards was indebted to the favour or esteem of Julian for the honour of a brass statue and the important offices of consular of the second Pannonia and praefect of the city Ammian xxi  So extravagant a fable was incapable however of deceiving the public credulity or even of satisfying the pride of the emperor himself Secretly conscious that the applause and favour of the Romans accompanied the rising fortunes of Julian his discontented mind was prepared to receive the subtle poison of those artful sycophants who coloured their mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of truth and candour  Callido nocendi artificio accusatoriam diritatem laudum titulis peragebant Hae voces fuerunt ad inslammanda odia probris omnibus potentiores See Mamertin in Actione Gratiarum in Vet Panegyr xi  Instead of depreciating the merits of Julian they acknowledged and even exaggerated his popular fame superior talents and important services But they darkly insinuated that the virtues of the Caesar might instantly be converted into the most dangerous crimes if the inconstant multitude should prefer their inclinations to their duty or if the general of a victorious army should be tempted  from his allegiance by the hopes of revenge and independent greatness The personal fears of Constantius were interpreted by his council as  Fears and envy of Constantius  a laudable anxiety for the public safety whilst in private and perhaps in his own breast he disguised under the less odious appellation of fear the sentiments of hatred and envy which he had secretly conceived for the inimitable virtues of Julian  The apparent tranquillity of Gaul and the  The legions of Gaul are ordered to march into the East A D April  imminent danger of the eastern provinces offered a specious pretence for the design which was artfully concerted by the Imperial ministers They resolved to disarm the Caesar to recall those faithful troops who guarded his person and dignity and to employ in a distant war against the Persian monarch the hardy veterans who had vanquished on the banks of the Rhine the fiercest nations of Germany While Julian used the laborious hours of his winterquarters at Paris in the administration of power which in his hands was the exercise of virtue he was surprised by the hasty arrival of a tribune and a notary with positive orders from the emperor which  they  were directed to execute and  he  was commanded not to oppose Constantius signified his pleasure that four entire legions the Celtae and Petulants the Heruli and the Batavians should be separated from the standard of Julian under which they had acquired their fame and discipline that in each of the remaining bands three hundred of the bravest youths should be  selected and that this numerous detachment the strength of the Gallic army should instantly begin their march and exert their utmost diligence to arrive before the opening of the campaign on the frontiers of Persia  The minute interval which may be interposed between the  byeme adultâ  and the  primo vere  of Ammianus xx instead of allowing a sufficient space for a march of three thousand miles would render the orders of Constantius as extravagant as they were unjust The troops of Gaul could not have reached Syria till the end of autumn The memory of Ammianus must have been inaccurate and his language incorrect  The Caesar foresaw and lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate Most of the auxiliaries who engaged their voluntary service had stipulated that they should never be obliged to pass the Alps The public faith of Rome and the personal honour of Julian had been pledged for the observance of this condition Such an act of treachery and oppression would destroy the confidence and excite the resentment of the independent warriors of Germany who considered truth as the noblest of their virtues and freedom as the most valuable of their possessions The legionaries who enjoyed the title and privileges of Romans were enlisted for the general defence of the republic but those mercenary troops heard with cold indifference the antiquated names of the republic and of Rome Attached either from birth or long habit to the climate and manners of Gaul they loved and admired Julian they despised and perhaps hated the emperor they dreaded the laborious march the Persian arrows and the burning deserts  of Asia They claimed as their own the country which they had saved and excused their want of spirit by pleading the sacred and more immediate duty of protecting their families and friends The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of the impending and inevitable danger As soon as the provinces were exhausted of their military strength the Germans would violate a treaty which had been imposed on their fears and notwithstanding the abilities and valour of Julian the general of a nominal army to whom the public calamities would be imputed must find himself after a vain resistance either a prisoner in the camp of the Barbarians or a criminal in the palace of Constantius If Julian complied with the orders which he had received he subscribed his own destruction and that of a people who deserved his affection But a positive refusal was an act of rebellion and a declaration of war The inexorable jealousy of the emperor the peremptory and perhaps insidious nature of his commands left not any room for a fair apology or candid interpretation and the dependent station of the Caesar scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate Solitude encreased the perplexity of Julian he could no longer apply to the faithful counsels of Sallust who had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs he could not even enforce his representations by the concurrence of the ministers who would have been afraid or ashamed  to approve the ruin of Gaul The moment had been chosen when Lupicinus  Ammianus xx The valour of Lupicinus and his military skill are acknowledged by the historian who in his affected language accuses the general of exalting the horns of his pride bellowing in a tragic tone and exciting a doubt whether he was more cruel or avaricious The danger from the Scots and Picts was so serious that Julian himself had some thoughts of passing over into the island  the general of the cavalry was dispatched into Britain to repulse the inroads of the Scots and Picts and Florentius was occupied at Vienna by the assessment of the tribute The latter a crafty and corrupt statesman declining to assume a responsible part on this dangerous occasion eluded the pressing and repeated invitations of Julian who represented to him that in every important measure the presence of the praefect was indispensable in the council of the prince In the mean while the Caesar was oppressed by the rude and importunate solicitations of the Imperial messengers who presumed to suggest that if he expected the return of his ministers he would charge himself with the guilt of the delay and reserve for them the merit of the execution Unable to resist unwilling to comply Julian expressed in the most serious terms his wish and even his intention of resigning the purple which he could not preserve with honour but which he could not abdicate with safety  After a painful conflict Julian was compelled  Their discontents  to acknowledge that obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject and that the sovereign  alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare He issued the necessary orders for carrying into execution the commands of Constantius a part of the troops began their march for the Alps and the detachments from the several garrisons moved towards their respective places of assembly They advanced with difficulty through the trembling and affrighted crowds of provincials who attempted to excite their pity by silent despair or loud lamentations while the wives of the soldiers holding their infants in their arms accused the desertion of their husbands in the mixed language of grief of tenderness and of indignation This scene of general distress afflicted the humanity of the Caesar he granted a sufficient number of postwaggons to transport the wives and families of the soldiers  He granted them the permission of the  cursus clavularis  or  clabularis  These postwaggons are often mentioned in the Code and were supposed to carry fifteen hundred pounds weight See Vales d Ammian xx  endeavoured to alleviate the hardships which he was constrained to inflict and encreased by the most laudable arts his own popularity and the discontent of the exiled troops The grief of an armed multitude is soon converted into rage their licentious murmurs which every hour were communicated from tent to tent with more boldness and effect prepared their minds for the most daring acts of sedition and by the connivance of their tribunes a seasonable libel was secretly dispersed which painted  in lively colours the disgrace of the Caesar the oppression of the Gallic army and the feeble vices of the tyrant of Asia The servants of Constantius were astonished and alarmed by the progress of this dangerous spirit They pressed the Caesar to hasten the departure of the troops but they imprudently rejected the honest and judicious advice of Julian who proposed that they should not march through Paris and suggested the danger and temptation of a last interview  As soon as the approach of the troops was  They proclaim Julian emporor  announced the Caesar went out to meet them and ascended his tribunal which had been erected in a plain before the gates of the city After distinguishing the officers and soldiers who by their rank or merit deserved a peculiar attention Julian addressed himself in a studied oration to the surrounding multitude he celebrated their exploits with grateful applause encouraged them to accept with alacrity the honour of serving under the eyes of a powerful and liberal monarch and admonished them that the commands of Augustus required an instant and cheerful obedience The soldiers who were apprehensive of offending their general by an indecent clamour or of belying their sentiments by false and venal acclamations maintained an obstinate silence and after a short pause were dismissed to their quarters The principal officers were entertained by the Caesar who professed in the warmest language of friendship  his desire and his inability to reward according to their deserts the brave companions of his victories They retired from the feast full of grief and perplexity and lamented the hardship of their fate which tore them from their beloved general and their native country The only expedient which could prevent their separation was boldly agitated and approved the popular resentment was insensibly moulded into a regular conspiracy their just reasons of complaint were heightened by passion and their passions were inflamed by wine as on the eve of their departure the troops were indulged in licentious festivity At the hour of midnight the impetuous multitude with swords and bowls and torches in their hands rushed into the suburbs encompassed the palace  Most probably the palace of the baths  Thermarum  of which a solid and lofty hall still subsists in the  rue de la Harpe  The buildings covered a considerable space of the modern quarter of the university and the gardens under the Merovingian kings communicated with the abbey of St Germain des Prez By the injuries of time and the Normans this ancient palace was reduced in the twelfth century to a maze of ruins whose dark recesses were the scene of licentious love  Explicat aula sinus montemque amplectitur alis  Multiplici latebrâ scelerum tersura ruborem  pereuntis saepe pudoris  Celatura nefas Venerisque accommoda  furtis  These lines are quoted from the Architrenius l iv c a poetical work of John de Hauteville or Hanville a Monk of St Albans about the year See Warton's History of English Poetry vol i dissert ii Yet such  thefts  might be less pernicious to mankind than the theological disputes of the Sorbonne which have been since agitated on the same ground Bonamy Mem de l'Academie tom xv p  and  careless of future dangers pronounced the fatal and irrevocable words JULIAN AUGUSTUS The prince whose anxious suspence was interrupted by their disorderly acclamations secured the doors against their intrusion and as long as it was in his power secluded his person and dignity from the accidents of a nocturnal tumult At the dawn of day the soldiers whose zeal was irritated by opposition forcibly entered the palace seized with respectful violence the object of their choice guarded Julian with drawn swords through the streets of Paris placed him on the tribunal and with repeated shouts saluted him as their emperor Prudence as well as loyalty inculcated the propriety of resisting their treasonable designs and of preparing for his oppressed virtue the excuse of violence Addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to individuals he sometimes implored their mercy and sometimes expressed his indignation conjured them not to fully the fame of their immortal victories and ventured to promise that if they would immediately return to their allegiance he would undertake to obtain from the emperor not only a free and gracious pardon but even the revocation of the orders which had excited their resentment But the soldiers who were conscious of their guilt chose rather to depend on the gratitude of Julian than on the clemency of the emperor Their zeal was insensibly turned into impatience and their impatience into rage The inflexible Caesar sustained  till the third hour of the day their prayers their reproaches and their menaces nor did he yield till he had been repeatedly assured that if he wished to live he must consent to reign He was exalted on a shield in the presence and amidst the unanimous acclamations of the troops a rich military collar which was offered by chance supplied the want of a diadem  Even in this tumultuous moment Julian attended to the forms of superstitious ceremony and obstinately refused the inauspicious use of a female necklace or a horsecollar which the impatient soldiers would have employed in the room of a diadem  the ceremony was concluded by the promise of a moderate donative  An equal proportion of gold and silver five pieces of the former one pound of the latter the whole amounting to about five pounds ten shillings of our money  and the new emperor overwhelmed with real or affected grief retired into the most secret recesses of his apartment  For the whole narrative of this revolt we may appeal to authentic and original materials Julian himself ad S P Q Atheniensem p Libanius Orat Parental c in Fabricius Bibliot Graec tom vii p Ammianus xx and Zosimus l iii p who in the reign of Julian appears to follow the more respectable authority of Eunapius With such guides we  might  neglect the abbreviators and ecclesiastical historians    The grief of Julian could proceed only from his innocence but his innocence must appear  His protestations of innocence  extremely doubtful  Eutropius a respectable witness uses a doubtful expression "consensu militum" x Gregory Nazianzen whose ignorance might excuse his fanaticism directly charges the apostate with presumption madness and impious rebellion  Orat iii p  in the eyes of those who have learned to suspect the motives and the professions  of princes His lively and active mind was susceptible of the various impressions of hope and fear of gratitude and revenge of duty and of ambition of the love of fame and of the fear of reproach But it is impossible for us to calculate the respective weight and operation of these sentiments or to ascertain the principles of action which might escape the observation while they guided or rather impelled the steps of Julian himself The discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his enemies their tumult was the natural effect of interest and of passion and if Julian had tried to conceal a deep design under the appearances of chance he must have employed the most consummate artifice without necessity and probably without success He solemnly declares in the presence of Jupiter of the Sun of Mars of Minerva and of all the other deities that till the close of the evening which preceded his elevation he was utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers  Julian ad S P Q Athen p The  devout  Abbé de la Bleterie Vie de Julien p is almost inclined to respect the  devout  protestations of a Pagan  and it may seem ungenerous to distrust the honour of a hero and the truth of a philosopher Yet the superstitious confidence that Constantius was the enemy and that he himself was the favourite of the gods might prompt him to desire to solicit and even to hasten the auspicious moment of his reign which was predestined to restore the ancient religion of  mankind When Julian had received the intelligence of the conspiracy he resigned himself to a short slumber and afterwards related to his friends that he had seen the Genius of the empire waiting with some impatience at his door pressing for admittance and reproaching his want of spirit and ambition  Ammian xx with the note of Lindenbrogius on the Genius of the empire Julian himself in a confidential letter to his friend and physician Oribasius Epist xvii p mentions another dream to which before the event he gave credit of a stately tree thrown to the ground of a small plant striking a deep root into the earth Even in his sleep the mind of the Caesar must have been agitated by the hopes and fears of his fortune Zosimus l iii p relates a subsequent dream  Astonished and perplexed he addressed his prayers to the great Jupiter who immediately signified by a clear and manifest omen that he should submit to the will of heaven and of the army The conduct which disclaims the ordinary maxims of reason excites our suspicion and eludes our enquiry Whenever the spirit of fanaticism at once so credulous and so crafty has insinuated itself into a noble mind it insensibly corrodes the vital principles of virtue and veracity  To moderate the zeal of his party to protect  His embassy to Constantius  the persons of his enemies  The difficult situation of the prince of a rebellious army is finely described by Tacitus Hist But Otho had much more guilt and much less abilities than Julian  to defeat and to despise the secret enterprises which were formed against his life and dignity were the cares which employed the first days of the reign of the new Emperor Although he was firmly resolved to maintain the  station which he had assumed he was still desirous of saving his country from the calamities of civil war of declining a contest with the superior forces of Constantius and of preserving his own character from the reproach of perfidy and ingratitude Adorned with the ensigns of military and Imperial pomp Julian shewed himself in the field of Mars to the soldiers who glowed with ardent enthusiasm in the cause of their pupil their leader and their friend He recapitulated their victories lamented their sufferings applauded their resolution animated their hopes and checked their impetuosity nor did he dismiss the assembly till he had obtained a solemn promise from the troops that if the emperor of the East would subscribe an equitable treaty they would renounce any views of conquest and satisfy themselves with the tranquil possession of the Gallic provinces On this foundation he composed in his own name and in that of the army a specious and moderate epistle  To this ostensible epistle he added says Ammianus private letters objurgatorias et mordaces which the historian had not seen and would not have published Perhaps they never existed  which was delivered to Pentadius his master of the offices and to his chamberlain Eutherius two ambassadors whom he appointed to receive the answer and observe the dispositions of Constantius This epistle is inscribed with the modest appellation of Caesar but Julian solicits in a peremptory though respectful  manner the confirmation of the title of Augustus He acknowledges the irregularity of his own election while he justifies in some measure the resentment and violence of the troops which had extorted his reluctant consent He allows the supremacy of his brother Constantius and engages to send him an annual present of Spanish horses to recruit his army with a select number of Barbarian youths and to accept from his choice a Praetorian praefect of approved discretion and fidelity But he reserves for himself the nomination of his other civil and military officers with the troops the revenue and the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps He admonishes the emperor to consult the dictates of justice to distrust the arts of those venal flatterers who subsist only by the discord of princes and to embrace the offer of a fair and honourable treaty equally advantageous to the republic and to the house of Constantine In this negociation Julian claimed no more than he already possessed The delegated authority which he had long exercised over the provinces of Gaul Spain and Britain was still obeyed under a name more independent and august The soldiers and the people rejoiced in a revolution which was not stained even with the blood of the guilty Florentius was a fugitive Lupicinus a prisoner The persons who were disaffected to the new government were disarmed and secured and the vacant offices were distributed according to the recommendation of merit by a  prince who despised the intrigues of the palace and the clamours of the soldiers  See the first transactions of his reign in Julian ad S P Q Athen p Ammianus xx Liban Orat Parent c p    The negociations of peace were accompanied  His fourth and fifth expeditions beyond the Rhine A D  and supported by the most vigorous preparations for war The army which Julian held in readiness for immediate action was recruited and augmented by the disorders of the times The cruel persecution of the faction of Magnentius had filled Gaul with numerous bands of outlaws and robbers They cheerfully accepted the offer of a general pardon from a prince whom they could trust submitted to the restraints of military discipline and retained only their implacable hatred to the person and government of Constantius  Liban Orat Parent c p A strange disorder since it continued above seven years In the factions of the Greek republics the exiles amounted to persons and Isocrates assures Philip that it would be easier to raise an army from the vagabonds than from the cities See Hume's Essays tom i p  As soon as the season of the year permitted Julian to take the field he appeared at the head of his legions threw a bridge over the Rhine in the neighbourhood of Cleves and prepared to chastise the perfidy of the Attuarii a tribe of Franks who presumed that they might ravage with impunity the frontiers of a divided empire The difficulty as well as glory of this enterprize consisted in a laborious march and Julian had conquered as soon as he could penetrate into a country which former  princes had considered as inaccessible After he had given peace to the Barbarians the emperor carefully visited the fortifications along the Rhine from Cleves to Basil surveyed with peculiar attention the territories which he had recovered from the hands of the Alemanni passed through Besançon  Julian Epist xxxviii p gives a short description of Vesontio or Besançon a rocky peninsula almost encircled by the river Doux once a magnificent city filled with temples c now reduced to a small town emerging however from its ruins  which had severely suffered from their fury and fixed his headquarters at Vienna for the ensuing winter The barrier of Gaul was improved and strengthened with additional fortifications and Julian entertained some hopes that the Germans whom he had so often vanquished might in his absence be restrained by the terror of his name Vadomair  Vadomair entered into the Roman service and was promoted from a Barbarian kingdom to the military rank of duke of Phaenicia He still retained the same artful character Ammian xxi but under the reign of Valens he signalised his valour in the Armenian war xxix  was the only prince of the Alemanni whom he esteemed or feared and while the subtle Barbarian affected to observe the faith of treaties the progress of his arms threatened the state with an unseasonable and dangerous war The policy of Julian condescended to surprise the prince of the Alemanni by his own arts and Vadomair who in the character of a friend had incautiously accepted an invitation from the Roman governors was seized in the midst of the entertainment and sent away prisoner into the heart of Spain  Before the Barbarians were recovered from their amazement the emperor appeared in arms on the banks of the Rhine and once more crossing the river renewed the deep impressions of terror and respect which had been already made by four preceding expeditions  Ammian xx xxi Zosimus l iii p    The ambassadors of Julian had been instructed  Fruitless treaty and declaration of war A D  to execute with the utmost diligence their important commission But in their passage through Italy and Illyricum they were detained by the tedious and affected delays of the provincial governors they were conducted by slow journies from Constantinople to Caesarea in Cappadocia and when at length they were admitted to the presence of Constantius they found that he had already conceived from the dispatches of his own officers the most unfavourable opinion of the conduct of Julian and of the Gallic army The letters were heard with impatience the trembling messengers were dismissed with indignation and contempt and the looks the gestures the furious language of the monarch expressed the disorder of his soul The domestic connection which might have reconciled the brother and the husband of Helena was recently dissolved by the death of that princess whose pregnancy had been several times fruitless and was at last fatal to herself  Her remains were sent to Rome and interred near those of her sister Constantina in the suburb of the  Via Nomentana  Ammian xxi Libanius has composed a very weak apology to justify his hero from a very absurd charge of poisoning his wife and rewarding her physician with his mother's jewels See the seventh of seventeen new orations published at Venice from a MS in St Mark's library p Elpidius the Praetorian praefect of the East to whose evidence the accuser of Julian appeals is arraigned by Libanius as  effeminate  and ungrateful yet the religion of Elpidius is praised by Jerom tom i p and his humanity by Ammianus xxi  The empress Eusebia  had preserved to the last moment of her life the warm and even jealous affection which she had conceived for Julian and her mild influence might have moderated the resentment of a prince who since her death was abandoned to his own passions and to the arts of his eunuchs But the terror of a foreign invasion obliged him to suspend the punishment of a private enemy he continued his march towards the confines of Persia and thought it sufficient to signify the conditions which might entitle Julian and his guilty followers to the clemency of their offended sovereign He required that the presumptuous Caesar should expressly renounce the appellation and rank of Augustus which he had accepted from the rebels that he should descend to his former station of a limited and dependent minister that he should vest the powers of the state and army in the hands of those officers who were appointed by the Imperial court and that he should trust his safety to the assurances of pardon which were announced by Epictetus a Gallic bishop and one of the Arian favourites of Constantius Several months were ineffectually consumed in a treaty which was negociated at the distance of three thousand miles between  Paris and Antioch and as soon as Julian perceived that his moderate and respectful behaviour served only to irritate the pride of an implacable adversary he boldly resolved to commit his life and fortune to the chance of a civil war He gave a public and military audience to the quaestor Leonas the haughty epistle of Constantius was read to the attentive multitude and Julian protested with the most flattering deference that he was ready to resign the title of Augustus if he could obtain the consent of those whom he acknowledged as the authors of his elevation The saint proposal was impetuously silenced and the acclamations of  Julian Augustus continue to reign by the authority of the army of the people of the republic which you have saved  thundred at once from every part of the field and terrified the pale ambassador of Constantius A part of the letter was afterwards read in which the emperor arraigned the ingratitude of Julian whom he had invested with the honours of the purple whom he had educated with so much care and tenderness whom he had preserved in his infancy when he was left a helpless orphan  an orphan  interrupted Julian who justified his cause by indulging his passions  Does the assassin of my family reproach me that I was left an orphan He urges me to revenge those injuries which I have long studied to forget  The assembly was dismissed and Leonas who with some difficulty had been  protected from the popular fury was sent back to his master with an epistle in which Julian expressed in a strain of the most vehement eloquence the sentiments of contempt of hatred and of resentment which had been suppressed and embittered by the dissimulation of twenty years After this message which might be considered as a signal of irreconcilable war Julian who some weeks before had celebrated the Christian festival of the Epiphany  Feriarum die quem celebrantes mense Januario Christiani  Epiphania  dictitant progressus in eorum ecclesiam solemniter numine orato discessit Ammian xxi Zonaras observes that it was on Christmasday and his assertion is not inconsistent since the churches of Egypt Asia and perhaps Gaul celebrated on the same day the sixth of January the nativity and the baptism of their Saviour The Romans as ignorant as their brethren of the real date of his birth fixed the solemn festival to the th of December the  Brumalia  or

declaration that he committed the care of his safety to the IMMORTAL GODS and thus publicly renounced the religion as well as the friendship of Constantius  The public and secret negociations between

intercepted letters that his adversary sacrificing the interest of the state to that of the  monarch had again excited the Barbarians to invade the provinces of the West The position of two magazines one of them collected on the banks of the lake of Constance the other formed at the foot of the Cottian Alps seemed to indicate the march of two armies and the size of those magazines each of which consisted of six hundred thousand quarters of wheat or rather flour  Three hundred myriads or three millions of  medimni  a cornmeasure familiar to the Athenians and which contained six Roman  modii  Julian explains like a soldier and a statesman the danger of his situation and the necessity and advantages of an offensive war ad S P Q Athen p  was a threatening evidence of the strength and numbers of the enemy who prepared to surround him But the Imperial legions were still in their distant quarters of Asia the Danube was feebly guarded and if Julian could occupy by a sudden incursion the important provinces of Illyricum he might expect that a people of soldiers would resort to his standard and that the rich mines of gold and silver would contribute to the expences of the civil war He proposed this bold enterprise to the assembly of the soldiers inspired them with a just confidence in their general and in themselves and exhorted them to maintain their reputation of being terrible to the enemy moderate to their fellowcitizens and obedient to their officers His spirited discourse was received with the loudest acclamations and the same troops which had taken up arms against Constantius when he summoned them to leave Gaul now declared with  alacrity that they would follow Julian to the farthest extremities of Europe or Asia The oath of fidelity was administered and the soldiers clashing their shields and pointing their drawn swords to their throats devoted themselves with horrid imprecations to the service of a leader whom they celebrated as the deliverer of Gaul and the conqueror of the Germans  See his oration and the behaviour of the troops in Ammian xxi  This solemn engagement which seemed to be dictated by affection rather than by duty was singly opposed by Nebridius who had been admitted to the office of Praetorian praefect That faithful minister alone and unassisted asserted the rights of Constantius in the midst of an armed and angry multitude to whose fury he had almost fallen an honourable but useless sacrifice After losing one of his hands by the stroke of a sword he embraced the knees of the prince whom he had offended Julian covered the praefect with his Imperial mantle and protecting him from the zeal of his followers dismissed him to his own house with less respect than was perhaps due to the virtue of an enemy  He sternly refused his hand to the suppliant praefect whom he sent into Tuscany Ammian xxi Libanius with savage fury insults Nebridius applauds the soldiers and almost censures the humanity of Julian Orat Parent c p  The high office of Nebridius was bestowed on Sallust and the provinces of Gaul which were now delivered from the intolerable oppression of taxes enjoyed the mild and equitable administration of the friend of Julian who was permitted to practise those  virtues which he had instilled into the mind of his pupil  Ammian xxi In this promotion Julian obeyed the law which he publicly imposed on himself Neque civilis quisquam judex nec militaris rector alio quodam praeter merita suffragante ad potiorum veniat gradum Ammian xx Absence did not weaken his regard for Sallust with whose name A D he honoured the consulship    The hopes of Julian depended much less on  His march from the Rhine into Illyricum  the number of his troops than on the celerity of his motions In the execution of a daring enterprise he availed himself of every precaution as far as prudence could suggest and where prudence could no longer accompany his steps he trusted the event to valour and to fortune In the neighbourhood of Basil he assembled and divided his army  Ammianus xxi ascribes the same practice and the same motive to Alexander the Groat and other skilful generals  One body which consisted of ten thousand men was directed under the command of Nevitta general of the cavalry to advance through the midland parts of Rhaetia and Noricum A similar division of troops under the orders of Jovius and Jovinus prepared to follow the oblique course of the highways through the Alps and the northern confines of Italy The instructions to the generals were conceived with energy and precision to hasten their march in close and compact columns which according to the disposition of the ground might readily be changed into any order of battle to secure themselves against the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards to prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival to elude  examination by their sudden departure to spread the opinion of their strength and the terror of his name and to join their sovereign under the walls of Sirmium For himself Julian had reserved a more difficult and extraordinary part He selected three thousand brave and active volunteers resolved like their leader to cast behind them every hope of a retreat at the head of this faithful band he fearlessly plunged into the recesses of the Marcian or black forest which conceals the sources of the Danube  This wood was a part of the great Hercynian forest which in the time of Caesar stretched away from the country of the Rauraci Basil into the boundless regions of the North See Cluver Germania Antiqua l iii c  and for many days the fate of Julian was unknown to the world The secrecy of his march his diligence and vigour surmounted every obstacle he forced his way over mountains and morasses occupied the bridges or swam the rivers pursued his direct course  Compare Libanius Orat Parent c p with Gregory Nazianzen Orat iii p Even the saint admires the speed and secrecy of this march A modern divine might apply to the progress of Julian the lines which were originally designed for another apostate  So eagerly the fiend  O'er bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare  With head hands wings or feet pursues his way  And swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies  without reflecting whether he traversed the territory of the Romans or of the Barbarians and at length emerged between Ratisbon and Vienna at the place where he designed to embark his troops on the Danube By a wellconcerted stratagem he seized a fleet  of light brigantines  In that interval the  Notitia  places two or three fleets the Lauriacensis at Lauriacum or Lorch the Arlapensis the Maginensis and mentions five legions or cohorts of Liburnarii who should be a sort of marines Sect lviii edit Labb  as it lay at anchor secured a supply of coarse provisions sufficient to satisfy the indelicate but voracious appetite of a Gallic army and boldly committed himself to the stream of the Danube The labours of his mariners who plied their oars with incessant diligence and the steady continuance of a favourable wind carried his fleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days  Zosimus alone l iii p has specified this interesting circumstance Mamertinus in Panegyr Vet xi who accompanied Julian as count of the sacred largesses describes this voyage in a florid and pictoresque manner challenges Triptolemus and the Argonauts of Greece c  and he had already disembarked his troops at Bononia only nineteen miles from Sirmium before his enemies could receive any certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the Rhine In the course of this long and rapid navigation the mind of Julian was fixed on the object of his enterprise and though he accepted the deputation of some cities which hastened to claim the merit of an early submission he passed before the hostile stations which were placed along the river without indulging the temptation of signalizing an useless and illtimed valour The banks of the Danube were crowded on either side with spectators who gazed on the military pomp anticipated the importance of the event and diffused through the adjacent country the same of a young hero who advanced with more  than mortal speed at the head of the innumerable forces of the West Lucilian who with the rank of general of the cavalry commanded the military powers of Illyricum was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful reports which he could neither reject nor believe He had taken some slow and irresolute measures for the purpose of collecting his troops when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus an active officer whom Julian as soon as he landed at Bononia had pushed forwards with some light infantry The captive general uncertain of his life or death was hastily thrown upon a horse and conducted to the presence of Julian who kindly raised him from the ground and dispelled the terror and amazement which seemed to stupify his faculties But Lucilian had no sooner recovered his spirits than he betrayed his want of discretion by presuming to admonish his conqueror that he had rashly ventured with a handful of men to expose his person in the midst of his enemies  Reserve for your master Constantius these timid remonstrances replied Julian with a smile of contempt when I gave you my purple to kiss I received you not as a counsellor but as a suppliant  Conscious that success alone could justify his attempt and that boldness only could command success he instantly advanced at the head of three thousand soldiers to attack the strongest and most populous city of the Illyrian provinces As he entered the long suburb of Sirmium he was received by the joyful acclamations of the army and people who crowned  with flowers and holding lighted tapers in their hands conducted their acknowledged sovereign to his Imperial residence Two days were devoted to the public joy which was celebrated by the games of the Circus but early on the morning of the third day Julian marched to occupy the narrow pass of Succi in the defiles of Mount Haemus which almost in the midway between Sirmium and Constantinople separates the provinces of Thrace and Dacia by an abrupt descent towards the former and a gentle declivity on the side of the latter  The description of Ammianus which might be supported by collateral evidence ascertains the precise situation of the  Angustiae Succorum  or passes of  Succi  M d'Anville from the trifling resemblance of names has placed them between Sardica and Naissus For my own justification I am obliged to mention the  only  error which I have discovered in the maps or writings of that admirable geographer  The defence of this important post was entrusted to the brave Nevitta who as well as the generals of the Italian division successfully executed the plan of the march and junction which their master had so ably conceived  Whatever circumstances we may borrow elsewhere Ammianus xxi still supplies the series of the narrative    The homage which Julian obtained from the  He justifies his cause  fears or the inclination of the people extended far beyond the immediate effect of his arms  Ammian xxi Libanius Orat Parent c p Zosimus l iii p  The praefectures of Italy and Illyricum were administered by Taurus and Florentius who united that important office with the vain honours of the consulship and as those magistrates had retired  with precipitation to the court of Asia Julian who could not always restrain the levity of his temper stigmatized their flight by adding in all the Acts of the Year the epithet of  fugitive  to the names of the two consuls The provinces which had been deserted by their first magistrates acknowledged the authority of an emperor who conciliating the qualities of a soldier with those of a philosopher was equally admired in the camps of the Danube and in the cities of Greece From his palace or more properly from his headquarters of Sirmium and Naissus he distributed to the principal cities of the empire a laboured apology for his own conduct published the secret dispatches of Constantius and solicited the judgment of mankind between two competitors the one of whom had expelled and the other had invited the Barbarians  Julian ad S P Q Athen p positively asserts that he intercepted the letters of Constantius to the Barbarians and Libanius as positively affirms that he read them on his march to the troops and the cities Yet Ammianus xxi expresses himself with cool and candid hesitation si  famae solius  admittenda est fides He specifies however an intercepted letter from Vadomair to Constantius which supposes an intimate correspondence between them "Caesar tuus disciplinam non habet"  Julian whose mind was deeply wounded by the reproach of ingratitude aspired to maintain by argument as well as by arms the superior merits of his cause and to excel not only in the arts of war but in those of composition His epistle to the senate and people of Athens  Zosimus mentions his epistles to the Athenians the Corinthians and the Lacedaemonians The substance was probably the same though the address was properly varied The epistle to the Athenians is still extant p and has afforded much valuable information It deserves the praises of the Abbé de la Bleterie Pref à l'Histoire de Jovien p and is one of the best manifestoes to be found in any language  seems to have been  dictated by an elegant enthusiasm which prompted him to submit his actions and his motives to the degenerate Athenians of his own times with the same humble deference as if he had been pleading in the days of Aristides before the tribunal of the Areopagus His application to the senate of Rome which was still permitted to bestow the titles of Imperial power was agreeable to the forms of the expiring republic An assembly was summoned by Tertullus praefect of the city the epistle of Julian was read and as he appeared to be master of Italy his claims were admitted without a dissenting voice His oblique censure of the innovations of Constantine and his passionate invective against the vices of Constantius were heard with less satisfaction and the senate as if Julian had been present unanimously exclaimed  Respect we beseech you the author of your own fortune  Auctori tuo reverentiam rogamus  Ammian xxi It is amusing enough to observe the secret conflicts of the senate between flattery and fear See Tacit Hist i    An artful expression which according to the chance of war might be differently explained as a manly reproof of the ingratitude of the usurper or as a flattering confession that a single act of such benefit to the state ought to atone for all the failings of Constantiüs  The intelligence of the march and rapid progress of Julian was speedily transmitted to his rival who by the retreat of Sapor had obtained  Hostile preparations  some respite from the Persian war Disguising the anguish of his soul under the semblance of contempt Constantius professed his intention of returning into Europe and of giving chace to Julian for he never spoke of this military expedition in any other light than that of a hunting party  Tanquam venaticiam praedam caperet hoc enim ad leniendum suorum metum subinde praedicabat Ammian xxi  In the camp of Hierapolis in Syria he communicated this design to his army slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness of the Caesar and ventured to assure them that if the mutineers of Gaul presumed to meet them in the field they would be unable to sustain the fire of their eyes and the irresistible weight of their shout of onset The speech of the emperor was received with military applause and Theodotus the president of the council of Hierapolis requested with tears of adulation that  his  city might be adorned with the head of the vanquished rebel  See the speech and preparations in Ammianus xxi The vile Theodotus afterwards implored and obtained his pardon from the merciful conqueror who signified his wish of diminishing his enemies and increasing the number of his friends xxii  A chosen detachment was dispatched away in postwaggons to secure if it were yet possible the pass of Succi the recruits the horses the arms and the magazines which had been prepared against Sapor were appropriated to the service of the civil war and the domestic  victories of Constantius inspired his partisans with the most sanguine assurances of success The notary Gaudentius had occupied in his name the provinces of Africa the subsistence of Rome was intercepted and the distress of Julian was increased by an unexpected event which might have been productive of fatal consequences Julian had received the submission of two legions and a cohort of archers who were stationed at Sirmium but he suspected with reason the fidelity of those troops which had been distinguished by the emperor and it was thought expedient under the pretence of the exposed state of the Gallic frontier to dismiss them from the most important scene of action They advanced with reluctance as far as the confines of Italy but as they dreaded the length of the way and the savage fierceness of the Germans they resolved by the instigation of one of their tribunes to halt at Aquileia and to erect the banners of Constantius on the walls of that impregnable city The vigilance of Julian perceived at once the extent of the mischief and the necessity of applying an immediate remedy By his order Jovinus led back a part of the army into Italy and the siege of Aquileia was formed with diligence and prosecuted with vigour But the legionaries who seemed to have rejected the yoke of discipline conducted the defence of the place with skill and perseverance invited the rest of Italy to imitate the example of their courage and loyalty and threatened the retreat of  Julian if he should be forced to yield to the superior numbers of the armies of the East  Ammian xxi He seems to describe with superfluous labour the operations of the siege of Aquileia which on this occasion maintained its impregnable fame Gregory Nazianzen Orat iii p ascribes this accidental revolt to the wisdom of Constantius whose assured victory he announces with some appearance of truth Constantio quem credebat proculdubio fore victorem nemo enim omnium tunc ab hac constanti sententia discrepebat Ammian xxi    But the humanity of Julian was preserved from the cruel alternative which he pathetically laments  and death of Constantius A D Nov  of destroying or of being himself destroyed and the seasonable death of Constantius delivered the Roman empire from the calamities of civil war The approach of winter could not detain the monarch at Antioch and his favourites durst not oppose his impatient desire of revenge A slight fever which was perhaps occasioned by the agitation of his spirits was encreased by the fatigues of the journey and Constantius was obliged to halt at the little town of Mopsucrene twelve miles beyond Tarsus where he expired after a short illness in the fortyfifth year of his age and the twentyfourth of his reign  His death and character are faithfully delineated by Ammianus xxi and we are authorised to despise and detest the foolish calumny of Gregory Orat iii p who accuses Julian of contriving the death of his benefactor The private repentance of the emperor that he had spared and promoted Julian p and Orat xxi p is not improbable in itself nor incompatible with the public verbal testament which prudential considerations might dictate in the last moments of his life  His genuine character which was composed of pride and weakness of superstition and cruelty has been fully displayed in  the preceding narrative of civil and ecclesiastical events The long abuse of power rendered him a considerable object in the eyes of his contemporaries but as personal merit can alone deserve the notice of posterity the last of the sons of Constantine may be dismissed from the world with the remark that he inherited the defects without the abilities of his father Before Constantius expired he is said to have named Julian for his successor nor does it seem improbable that his anxious concern for the fate of a young and tender wife whom he left with child may have prevailed in his last moments over the harsher passions of hatred and revenge Eusebius and his guilty associates made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the eunuchs by the election of another emperor but their intrigues were rejected with disdain by an army which now abhorred the thought of civil discord and two officers of rank were instantly dispatched to assure Julian that every sword in the empire would be drawn for his service The military designs of that prince who had formed three different attacks against Thrace were prevented by this fortunate event Without shedding the blood of his fellowcitizens he escaped the dangers of a doubtful conflict and acquired the advantages of a complete victory Impatient to visit the place of his birth and the new capital of the empire he advanced from Naissus through the mountains of Haemus and the cities of Thrace When he reached Heraclea at the  distance of sixty miles all Constantinople was poured forth to receive him and he made his triumphal entry amidst the dutiful acclamations  Julian enters Constantinople Dec  of the soldiers the people and the senate An innumerable multitude pressed around him with eager respect and were perhaps disappointed when they beheld the small stature and simple garb of a hero whose unexperienced youth had vanquished the Barbarians of Germany and who had now traversed in a successful career the whole continent of Europe from the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Bosphorus  In describing the triumph of Julian Ammianus xxii assumes the lofty tone of an orator or poet while Libanius Orat Parent c p sinks to the grave simplicity of an historian  A few days afterwards when the remains of the deceased emperor were landed in the harbour the subjects of Julian applauded the real or affected humanity of their sovereign On foot without his diadem and clothed in a mourning habit he accompanied the funeral as far as the church of the Holy Apostles where the body was deposited and if these marks of respect may be interpreted as a selfish tribute to the birth and dignity of his Imperial kinsman the tears of Julian professed to the world that he had forgot the injuries and remembered only the obligations which he had received from Constantius  The funeral of Constantius is described by Ammianus xxi Gregory Nazianzen Orat iv p Mamertinus in Panegyr Vet xi Libanius Orat Parent c lvi p and Philostorgius l vi c with Godefroy's Dissertations p These writers and their followers Pagans Catholics Arians beheld with very different eyes both the dead and the living emperor  As soon as the  legions of Aquileia were assured of the death of the emperor they opened the gates of the city and by the sacrifice of their guilty leaders obtained an easy pardon from the prudence or lenity of Julian who in the thirtysecond year of his  and is acknowledged by the whole empire  age acquired the undisputed possession of the Roman empire  The day and year of the birth of Julian are not perfectly ascertained The day is probably the sixth of November and the year must be either or Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p Ducange Fam Byzantin p I have preferred the earlier date  Philosophy had instructed Julian to compare  His civil government and private life  the advantages of action and retirement but the elevation of his birth and the accidents of his life never allowed him the freedom of choice He might perhaps sincerely have preferred the groves of the academy and the society of Athens but he was constrained at first by the will and afterwards by the injustice of Constantius to expose his person and fame to the dangers of Imperial greatness and to make himself accountable to the world and to posterity for the happiness of millions  Julian himself p has expressed these philosophical ideas with much eloquence and some affectation in a very elaborate epistle to Themistius The Abbé de la Bleterie tom ii p who has given an elegant translation is inclined to believe that it was the celebrated Themistius whose orations are still extant  Julian recollected with terror the observation of his master Plato  Julian ad Themist p Petavius not p observes that this assage is taken from the fourth book de Legibus but either Julian quoted from memory or his MSS were different from ours Xenophon opens the Cyropaedia with a similar reflection  that the government of our flocks and herds is always  committed to beings of a superior species and that the conduct of nations requires and deserves the celestial powers of the Gods or of the Genii From this principle he justly concluded that the man who presumes to reign should aspire to the perfection of the divine nature that he should purify his soul from her mortal and terrestrial part that he should extinguish his appetites enlighten his understanding regulate his passions and subdue the wild beast which according to the lively metaphor of Aristotle  Aristot ap Julian p The MS of Vossius unsatisfied with a single beast affords the stronger reading of  which the experience of despotism may warrant  seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot The throne of Julian which the death of Constantius fixed on an independent basis was the seat of reason of virtue and perhaps of vanity He despised the honours renounced the pleasures and discharged with incessant diligence the duties of his exalted station and there were few among his subjects who would have consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem had they been obliged to submit their time and their actions to the rigorous laws which their philosophic emperor imposed on himself One of his most intimate friends  Libanius Orat Parentalis c lxxxiv lxxxv p has given this interesting detail of the private life of Julian He himself in Misopogon p mentions his vegetable diet and upbraids the gross and sensual appetite of the people of Antioch  who had often shared the frugal simplicity of his table has remarked that his light and sparing diet which was usually of  the vegetable kind left his mind and body always free and active for the various and important business of an author a pontiff a magistrate a general and a prince In one and the same day he gave audience to several ambassadors and wrote or dictated a great number of letters to his generals his civil magistrates his private friends and the different cities of his dominions He listened to the memorials which had been received considered the subject of the petitions and signified his intentions more rapidly than they could be taken in shorthand by the diligence of his secretaries He possessed such flexibility of thought and such firmness of attention that he could employ his hand to write his ear to listen and his voice to dictate and pursue at once three several trains of ideas without hesitation and without error While his ministers reposed the prince flew with agility from one labour to another and after a hasty dinner retired into his library till the public business which he had appointed for the evening summoned him to interrupt the prosecution of his studies The supper of the emperor was still less substantial than the former meal his sleep was never clouded by the fumes of indigestion and except in the short interval of a marriage which was the effect of policy rather than love the chaste Julian never shared his bed with a female companion  Lectulus Vestalium toris purior is the praise which Mamertinus Panegyr Vet xi addresses to Julian himself Libanius affirms in sober peremptory language that Julian never knew a woman before his marriage or after the death of his wife Orat Parent c lxxxviii p The chastity of Julian is confirmed by the impartial testimony of Ammianus xxv and the partial silence of the Christians Yet Julian ironically urges the reproach of the people of Antioch that he  almost always    in Misopogon p lay alone This suspicious expression is explained by the Abbé de la Bleterie Hist de Jovien tom ii p with candour and ingenuity  He was soon awakened by the  entrance of fresh secretaries who had slept the preceding day and his servants were obliged to wait alternately while their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment than the change of occupations The predecessors of Julian his uncle his brother and his cousin indulged their puerile taste for the games of the circus under the specious pretence of complying with the inclinations of the people and they frequently remained the greatest part of the day as idle spectators and as a part of the splendid spectacle till the ordinary round of twentyfour races  See Salmasius ad Sueton in Claud c xxi A twentyfifth race or  missus  was added to complete the number of one hundred chariots four of which the four colours started each heat  Centum quadrijugos agitabo ad flumina currus  It appears that they ran five or seven times round the  Meta  Sueton in Domitian c and from the measure of the Circus Maximus at Rome the Hippodrome at Constantinople c it might be about a fourmile course  was completely finished On solemn festivals Julian who felt and professed an unfashionable dislike to these frivolous amusements condescended to appear in the circus and after bestowing a careless glance on five or six of the races he hastily withdrew with the impatience of a philosopher who considered every moment  as lost that was not devoted to the advantage of the public or the improvement of his own mind  Julian in Misopogon p Julius Caesar had offended the Roman people by reading his dispatches during the actual race Augustus indulged their taste or his own by his constant attention to the important business of the circus for which he professed the warmest inclination Sueton in August c xlv  By this avarice of time he seemed to protract the short duration of his reign and if the dates were less securely ascertained we should refuse to believe that only sixteen months elapsed between the death of Constantius and the departure  December A D March A D  of his successor for the Persian war The actions of Julian can only be preserved by the care of the historian but the portion of his voluminous writings which is still extant remains as a monument of the application as well as of the genius of the emperor The Misopogon the Caesars several of his orations and his elaborate work against the Christian religion were composed in the long nights of the two winters the former of which he passed at Constantinople and the latter at Antioch  The reformation of the Imperial court was  Reformation of the palace  one of the first and most necessary acts of the government of Julian  The reformation of the palace is described by Ammianus xxii Libanius Orat Parent c lxii p c Mamertinus in Panegyr Vet xi Socrates l iii c and Zonaras tom ii l xiii p  Soon after his entrance into the palace of Constantinople he had occasion for the service of a barber An officer magnificently dressed immediately presented himself  It is a barber exclaimed the prince  with affected surprise that I want and not a receivergeneral of the finances  Ego non  rationalem  jussi sed tonsorem acciri Zonaras uses the less natural image of a  senator  Yet an officer of the finances who was satiated with wealth might desire and obtain the honours of the senate    He questioned the man concerning the profits of his employment and was informed that besides a large salary and some valuable perquisites he enjoyed a daily allowance for twenty servants and as many horses A thousand barbers a thousand cupbearers a thousand cooks were distributed in the several offices of luxury and the number of eunuchs could be compared only with the insects of a summer's day  are the original words of Libanius which I have faithfully quoted lest I should be suspected of magnifying the abuses of the royal household  The monarch who resigned to his subjects the superiority of merit and virtue was distinguished by the oppressive magnificence of his dress his table his buildings and his train The stately palaces erected by Constantine and his sons were decorated with many coloured marbles and ornaments of massy gold The most exquisite dainties were procured to gratify their pride rather than their taste birds of the most distant climates fish from the most remote seas fruits out of their natural season winter roses and summer snows  The expressions of Mamertinus are lively and forcible Quin etiam prandiorum et caenarum laboratas magnitudines Romanus populus sensit cum quaesitissimae dapes non gustu sed difficultatibus aestimarentur miracula avium longinqui maris pisces alieni temporis poma aestivae nives hybernae rosae  The domestic crowd of the palace  surpassed the expence of the legions yet the smallest part of this costly multitude was subservient to the use or even to the splendor of the throne The monarch was disgraced and the people was injured by the creation and sale of an infinite number of obscure and even titular employments and the most worthless of mankind might purchase the privilege of being maintained without the necessity of labour from the public revenue The waste of an enormous household the encrease of fees and perquisites which were soon claimed as a lawful debt and the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their enmity or solicited their favour suddenly enriched these haughty menials They abused their fortune without considering their past or their future condition and their rapine and venality could be equalled only by the extravagance of their dissipations Their silken robes were embroidered with gold their tables were served with delicacy and profusion the houses which they built for their own use would have covered the farm of an ancient consul and the most honourable citizens were obliged to dismount from their horses and respectfully to salute an eunuch whom they met on the public highway The luxury of the palace excited the contempt and indignation of Julian who usually slept on the ground who yielded with reluctance  to the indispensable calls of nature and who placed his vanity not in emulating but in despising the pomp of royalty By the total extirpation of a mischief which was magnified even beyond its real extent he was impatient to relieve the distress and to appease the murmurs of the people who support with less uneasiness the weight of taxes if they are convinced that the fruits of their industry are appropriated to the service of the state But in the execution of this salutary work Julian is accused of proceeding with too much haste and inconsiderate severity By a single edict he reduced the palace of Constantinople to an immense desert and dismissed with ignominy the whole train of slaves and dependents  Yet Julian himself was accused of bestowing whole towns on the eunuchs Orat vii against Polyclet p Libanius contents himself with a cold but positive denial of the fact which seems indeed to belong more properly to Constantius This charge however may allude to some unknown circumstance  without providing any just or at least benevolent exceptions for the age the services or the poverty of the faithful domestics of the Imperial family Such indeed was the temper of Julian who seldom recollected the fundamental maxim of Aristotle that true virtue is placed at an equal distance between the opposite vices The splendid and effeminate dress of the Asiatics the curls and paint the collars and bracelets which had appeared so ridiculous in the person of Constantine were consistently rejected by his philosophic successor  But with the sopperies Julian affected to renounce the decencies of dress and seemed to value himself for his neglect of the laws of cleanliness In a satirical performance which was designed for the public eye the emperor descants with pleasure and even with pride on the length of his nails and the inky blackness of his hands protests that although the greatest part of his body was covered with hair the use of the razor was confined to his head alone and celebrates with visible complacency the shaggy and  populous  In the Misopogon p he draws a very singular picture of himself and the following words are strangely characteristic  The friends of the Abbé de la Bleterie adjured him in the name of the French nation not to translate this passage so offensive to their delicacy Hist de Jovien tom ii p Like him I have contented myself with a transient allusion but the little animal which Julian  names  is a beast samiliar to man and signifies love  beard which he fondly cherished after the example of the philosophers of Greece Had Julian consulted the simple dictates of reason the first magistrate of the Romans would have scorned the affectation of Diogenes as well as that of Darius  But the work of public reformation would  Chamber of justice  have remained imperfect if Julian had only corrected the abuses without punishing the crimes of his predecessor's reign  We are now delivered says he in a familiar letter to one of his intimate friends we are now surprisingly delivered from the voracious jaws of the Hydra  Julian epist xxiii p He uses the words  in writing to his friend Hermogenes who like himself was conversant with the Greek poets    I do not mean to apply that epithet to my brother Constantius He is no more may the earth lie light on his head But his artful and cruel favourites studied to deceive and exasperate a prince whose natural mildness cannot be praised without some efforts of adulation It is not however my intention that even those men should be oppressed they are accused and they shall enjoy the benefit of a fair and impartial trial  To conduct this enquiry Julian named six judges of the highest rank in the state and army and as he wished to escape the reproach of condemning his personal enemies he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus and transferred to the commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final sentence without delay and without appeal The office of president was exercised by the venerable praefect of the East a  second  Sallust  The two Sallusts the praefect of Gaul and the praefect of the East must be carefully distinguished Hist des Empereurs tom iv p I have used the surname of  Secundus  as a convenient epithet The second Sallust

and Praefect on a man of wisdom firmness integrity c like himself Yet Ammianus ranks him xxi among the ministers of Julian quorum merita nôrat et fidem  one of the consuls elect whose merit is loudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence of his own applause But the civil wisdom of two magistrates was overbalanced by the ferocious violence of four generals Nevitta Agilo Jovinus and Arbetio Arbetio whom the public would have seen with less surprise at the bar than on the bench was supposed to possess the secret of the commission the armed and angry leaders of the Jovian and Herculian bands encompassed the tribunal and the judges were alternately swayed by the laws of justice and by the clamours of faction  The proceedings of this chamber of justice are related by Ammianus xxii and praised by Libanius Orat Parent c p    The chamberlain Eusebius who had so long  Punishment of the innocent and the guilty  abused the favour of Constantius expiated by an ignominious death the insolence the corruption and cruelty of his servile reign The executions of Paul and Apodemius the former of whom was burnt alive were accepted as an inadequate atonement by the widows and orphans of so many hundred Romans whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and murdered But Justice herself if we may use the pathetic expression of Ammianus  Ursuli vero necem ipsa mihi videtur flêsse justitia Libanius who imputes his death to the soldiers attempts to criminate the count of the largesses  appeared to weep over the fate  of Ursulus the treasurer of the empire and his blood accused the ingratitude of Julian whose distress had been seasonably relieved by the intrepid liberality of that honest minister The rage of the soldiers whom he had provoked by his indiscretion was the cause and the excuse of his death and the emperor deeply wounded by his own reproaches and those of the public offered some consolation to the family of Ursulus by the restitution of his consiscated fortunes Before the end of the year in which they had been adorned with the ensigns of the prefecture and consulship  Such respect was still entertained for the venerable names of the commonwealth that the public was surprised and scandalized to hear Taurus summoned as a criminal under the consulship of Taurus The summons of his colleague Florentius was probably delayed till the commencement of the ensuing year  Taurus and Florentius were reduced to implore the clemency of the inexorable tribunal of Chalcedon The former was banished to Vercellae in Italy and a sentence of death was pronounced against the latter A wise prince should have rewarded the crime of Taurus the faithful minister when he was no longer able to oppose the progress of a rebel had taken refuge in the court of his benefactor and his lawful sovereign But the guilt of Florentius justified the severity of the judges and his escape served to display the magnanimity of Julian who nobly checked the interested diligence of an informer and refused to learn what place concealed the wretched fugitive from his  just resentment  Ammian xx  Some months after the tribunal of Chalcedon had been dissolved the praetorian vicegerent of Africa the notary Gaudentius and Artemius  For the guilt and punishment of Artemius see Julian Epist x p and Ammianus xxii and Vales ad loc The merit of Artemius who demolished temples and was put to death by an apostate has tempted the Greek and Latin churches to honour him as a martyr But as ecclesiastical history attests that he was not only a tyrant but an Arian it is not altogether easy to justify this indiscreet promotion Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p  duke of Egypt were executed at Antioch Artemius had reigned the cruel and corrupt tyrant of a great province Gaudentius had long practised the arts of calumny against the innocent the virtuous and even the person of Julian himself Yet the circumstances of their trial and condemnation were so unskilfully managed that these wicked men obtained in the public opinion the glory of suffering for the obstinate loyalty with which they had supported the cause of Constantius The rest of his servants were protected by a general act of oblivion and they were left to enjoy with impunity the bribes which they had accepted either to defend the oppressed or to oppress the friendless This measure which on the soundest principles of policy may deserve our approbation was executed in a manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the throne Julian was tormented by the importunities of a multitude particularly of Egyptians who loudly redemanded the gifts which they had imprudently  or illegally bestowed he foresaw the endless prosecution of vexatious suits and he engaged a promise which ought always to have been sacred that if they would repair to Chalcedon he would meet them in person to hear and determine their complaints But as soon as they were landed he issued an absolute order which prohibited the watermen from transporting any Egyptian to Constantinople and thus detained his disappointed clients on the Asiatic shore till their patience and money being utterly exhausted they were obliged to return with indignant murmurs to their native country  See Ammian xxii and Vales ad locum and the Codex Theodosianus l ii tit xxxix leg and Godefroy's Commentary tom i p ad locum    The numerous army of spies of agents and  Clemency of Julian  informers enlisted by Constantius to secure the repose of one man and to interrupt that of millions was immediately disbanded by his generous successor Julian was slow in his suspicions and gentle in his punishments and his contempt of treason was the result of judgment of vanity and of courage Conscious of superior merit he was persuaded that few among his subjects would dare to meet him in the field to attempt his life or even to seat themselves on his vacant throne The philosopher could excuse the hasty sallies of discontent and the hero could despise the ambitious projects which surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the rash conspirators A citizen of Ancyra had prepared for his own use  a purple garment and this indiscreet action which under the reign of Constantius would have been considered as a capital offence  The president Montesquieu Considerations sur la Grandeur c des Romains c xiv in his works tom iii p excuses this minute and absurd tyranny by supposing that actions the most indifferent in our eyes might excite in a Roman mind the idea of guilt and danger This strange apology is supported by a strange misapprehension of the English laws  chez une nation où il est defendû de boire à la santé d'une certaine personne  was reported to Julian by the officious importunity of a private enemy The monarch after making some inquiry into the rank and character of his rival dispatched the informer with a present of a pair of purple slippers to complete the magnificence of his Imperial habit A more dangerous conspiracy was formed by ten of the domestic guards who had resolved to assassinate Julian in the field of exercise near Antioch Their intemperance revealed their guilt and they were conducted in chains to the presence of their injured sovereign who after a lively representation of the wickedness and folly of their enterprise instead of a death of torture which they deserved and expected pronounced a sentence of exile against the two principal offenders The only instance in which Julian seemed to depart from his accustomed clemency was the execution of a rash youth who with a feeble hand had aspired to seize the reins of empire But that youth was the son of Marcellus the general of cavalry who in the first campaign of the  Gallic war had deserted the standard of the Caesar and the republic Without appearing to indulge his personal resentment Julian might easily confound the crime of the son and of the father but he was reconciled by the distress of Marcellus and the liberality of the emperor endeavoured to heal the wound which had been inflicted by the hand of justice  The clemency of Julian and the conspiracy which was formed against his life at Antioch are described by Ammianus xxii and Vales ad loc and Libanius Orat Parent c p    Julian was not insensible of the advantages of  His love of freedom and the republic  freedom  According to some says Aristotle as he is quoted by Julian ad Themist p the form of absolute government the  is contrary to nature Both the prince and the philosopher chuse however to involve this eternal truth in artful and laboured obscurity  From his studies he had imbibed the spirit of ancient sages and heroes his life and fortunes had depended on the caprice of a tyrant and when he ascended the throne his pride was sometimes mortified by the reflection that the slaves who would not dare to censure his defects were not worthy to applaud his virtues  That sentiment is expressed almost in the words of Julian himself Ammian xxii  He sincerely abhorred the system of Oriental despotism which Diocletian Constantine and the patient habits of fourscore years had established in the empire A motive of superstition prevented the execution of the design which Julian had frequently meditated of relieving his head from the weight of a costly diadem  Libanius Orat Parent c p who mentions the wish and design of Julian insinuates in mysterious language  that the emperor was restrained by some particular revelation    but he absolutely refused the title of  Dominus  or  Lord  Julian in Misopogon p As he never abolished by any public law the proud appellations of  Despot  or  Dominus  they are still extant on his medals Ducange Fam Byzantin p and the private displeasure which he affected to express only gave a different tone to the servility of the court The Abbé de la Bleterie Hist de Jovien tom ii p has curiously traced the origin and progress of the word  Dominus  under the Imperial government  a word which was grown so familiar to the ears of the Romans that they no longer remembered its servile and humiliating origin The office or rather the name of consul was cherished by a prince who contemplated with reverence the ruins of the republic and the same behaviour which had been assumed by the prudence of Augustus was adopted by Julian from choice and inclination On the calends of  A D Jan  January at break of day the new consuls Mamertinus and Nevitta hastened to the palace to salute the emperor As soon as he was informed of their approach he leaped from his throne eagerly advanced to meet them and compelled the blushing magistrates to receive the demonstrations of his affected humility From the palace they proceeded to the senate The emperor on foot marched before their litters and the gazing multitude admired the image of ancient times or secretly blamed a conduct which in their eyes degraded the majesty of the purple  Ammian xxii The consul Mamertinus in Panegyr Vet xi celebrates the auspicious day like an eloquent slave astonished and intoxicated by the condescension of his master    But the behaviour of Julian was uniformly supported During the games of the Circus he had imprudently or designedly performed the manumission of a slave in the presence of the consul The moment he was reminded that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of  another  magistrate he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold and embraced this public occasion of declaring to the world that he was subject like the rest of his fellowcitizens to the laws  Personal satire was condemned by the laws of the twelve tables  Si male condiderit in quem quis carmina jus est  Judiciumque  Julian in Misopogon p owns himself subject to the law and the Abbé de la Bleterie Hist de Jovien tom ii p has eagerly embraced a declaration so agreeable to his own system and indeed to the true spirit of the Imperial constitution  and even to the forms of the republic The spirit of his administration and his regard for the place of his nativity induced Julian to confer on the senate of Constantinople the same honours privileges and authority which were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient Rome  Zosimus l iii p  A legal fiction was introduced and gradually established that one half of the national council had migrated into the East and the despotic successors of Julian accepting the title of Senators acknowledged themselves the members of a respectable body which  was permitted to represent the majesty of the Roman name From Constantinople the attention of the monarch was extended to the municipal senates of the provinces He abolished by repeated edicts the unjust and pernicious exemptions which had withdrawn so many idle citizens from the service of their country and by imposing an equal distribution of public duties he restored the strength the splendour or according to the glowing expression of Libanius  See Libanius Orat Parent c p Ammianus xxii and the Theodosian Code l xii tit i leg with Godefroy's Commentary tom iv p Yet the whole subject of the  Curiae  notwithstanding very ample materials still remains the most obscure in the legal history of the empire  the soul of the expiring cities of his empire The venerable age of Greece excited  His care of the Grecian cities  the most tender compassion in the mind of Julian which kindled into rapture when he recollected the gods the heroes and the men superior to heroes and to gods who had bequeathed to the latest posterity the monuments of their genius or the example of their virtues He relieved the distress and restored the beauty of the cities of Epirus and Peloponnesus  Quae paulo ante arida et siti anhelantia visebantur ea nunc perlui mundari madere Fora Deambulacra Gymnasia laetis et gaudentibus populis frequentari dies festos et celebrari veteres et novos in honorem principis consecrari Mamertin xi He particularly restored the city of Nicopolis and the Actiac games which had been instituted by Augustus  Athens acknowledged him for her benefactor Argos for her deliverer The pride of Corinth again rising from her ruins with the honours of a Roman  colony exacted a tribute from the adjacent republics for the purpose of defraying the games of the Isthmus which were celebrated in the amphitheatre with the hunting of bears and panthers From this tribute the cities of Elis of Delphi and of Argos which had inherited from their remote ancestors the sacred office of perpetuating the Olympic the Pythian and the Nemean games claimed a just exemption The immunity of Elis and Delphi was respected by the Corinthians but the poverty of Argos tempted the insolence of oppression and the feeble complaints of its deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial magistrate who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital in which he resided Seven years after this sentence Julian  Julian Epist xxxv p This epistle which illustrates the declining age of Greece is omitted by the Abbé de la Bleterie and strangely disfigured by the Latin translator who by rendering    tributum  and    populus  directly contradicts the sense of the original  allowed the cause to be referred to a superior tribunal and his eloquence was interposed most probably with success in the defence of a city which had been the royal seat of Agamemnon  He reigned in Mycenae at the distance of fifty stadia or six miles from Argos but those cities which alternately flourished are confounded by the Greek poets Strabo l viii p edit Amstel  and had given to Macedonia a race of kings and conquerors  Marsham Canon Chron p This pedigree from Temenus and Hercules may be suspicious yet it was allowed after a strict enquiry by the judges of

Argos should retire T Liv xxxii    The laborious administration of military and civil affairs which were multiplied in proportion to the extent of the empire exercised the abilities  Julian an orator and a judge  of Julian but he frequently assumed the two characters of Orator  His eloquence is celebrated by Libanius Orat Parent c p who distinctly mentions the orators of Homer Socrates l iii c has rashly asserted that Julian was the only prince since Julius Caesar who harangued the senate All the predecessors of Nero Tacit Annal xiii and many of his successors possessed the faculty of speaking in public and it might be proved by various examples that they frequently exercised it in the senate  and of Judge  Ammianus xxii has impartially stated the merits and defects of his judicial proceedings Libanius Orat Parent c p c has seen only the fair side and his picture if it flatters the person expresses at least the duties of the Judge Gregory Nazianzen Orat iv p who suppresses the virtues and exaggerates even the venial faults of the apostate triumphantly asks Whether such a judge was fit to be seated between Minos and Rhadamanthus in the Elysian fields  which are almost unknown to the modern sovereigns of Europe The arts of persuasion so diligently cultivated by the first Caesars were neglected by the military ignorance and Asiatic pride of their successors and if they condescended to harangue the soldiers whom they feared they treated with silent disdain the senators whom they despised The assemblies of the senate which Constantius had avoided were considered by Julian as the place where he could exhibit with the most propriety the maxims of a republican  and the talents of a rhetorician He alternately practised as in a school of declamation the several modes of praise of censure of exhortation and his friend Libanius has remarked that the study of Homer taught him to imitate the simple concise style of Menelaus the copiousness of Nestor whose words descended like the flakes of a winter's snow or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses The functions of a judge which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince were exercised by Julian not only as a duty but as an amusement and although he might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his Praetorian prefects he often placed himself by their side on the seat of judgment The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably occupied in detecting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates who laboured to disguise the truth of facts and to pervert the sense of the laws He sometimes forgot the gravity of his station asked indiscreet or unseasonable questions and betrayed by the loudness of his voice and the agitation of his body the earnest vehemence with which he maintained his opinion against the judges the advocates and their clients But his knowledge of his own temper prompted him to encourage and even to solicit the reproof of his friends and ministers and whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular sallies of his passions the spectators could observe the shame as well as the gratitude of their monarch The decrees of Julian were almost always founded on  the principles of justice and he had the firmness to resist the two most dangerous temptations which assault the tribunal of a sovereign under the specious forms of compassion and equity He decided the merits of the cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties and the poor whom he wished to relieve were condemned to satisfy the just demands of a noble and wealthy adversary He carefully distinguished the judge from the legislator  Of the laws which Julian enacted in a reign of sixteen months fiftyfour have been admitted into the Codes of Theodosius and Justinian Gothofred Chron Legum p The Abbé de la Bleterie tom ii p has chosen one of these laws to give an idea of Julian's Latin style which is forcible and elaborate but less pure than his Greek  and though he meditated a necessary reformation of the Roman jurisprudence he pronounced sentence according to the strict and literal interpretation of those laws which the magistrates were bound to execute and the subjects to obey  The generality of princes if they were stripped  His character  of their purple and cast naked into the world would immediately sink to the lowest rank of society without a hope of emerging from their obscurity But the personal merit of Julian was in some measure independent of his fortune Whatever had been his choice of life by the force of intrepid courage lively wit and intense application he would have obtained or at least  he would have deserved the highest honours of his profession and Julian might have raised himself to the rank of minister or general of the state in which he was born a private citizen If the jealous caprice of power had disappointed his expectations if he had prudently declined the paths of greatness the employment of the same talents in studious solitude would have placed beyond the reach of kings his present happiness and his immortal fame When we inspect with minute or perhaps malevolent attention the portrait of Julian something seems wanting to the grace and perfection of the whole figure His genius was less powerful and sublime than that of Caesar nor did he possess the consummate prudence of Augustus The virtues of Trajan appear more steady and natural and the philosophy of Marcus is more simple and consistent Yet Julian sustained adversity with firmness and prosperity with moderation After an interval of one hundred and twenty years from the death of Alexander Severus the Romans beheld an emperor who made no distinction between his duties and his pleasures who laboured to relieve the distress and to revive the spirit of his subjects and who endeavoured always to connect authority with merit and happiness with virtue Even faction and religious faction was constrained to acknowledge the superiority of his genius in peace as well as in war and to confess with a sigh that the apostate Julian was a  lover of his country and that he deserved the empire of the world  Ductor fortissimus armis  Conditor et legum celeberrimus ore manûque  Consultor patriae sed non consultor habendae  Religionis amans tercentûm millia Divûm  Perfidus ille Deo sed non et perfidus orbi  Prudent Apotheosis c The

which clouded his virtues has exaggerated the  Religion of Julian  real and apparent magnitude of his faults Our partial ignorance may represent him as a philosophic monarch who studied to protect with an equal hand the religious factions of the empire and to allay the theological fever which had inflamed the minds of the people from the edicts of Diocletian to the exile of Athanasius A more accurate view of the character and conduct of Julian will remove this favourable prepossession for a prince who did not escape the general contagion of the times We enjoy the singular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been delineated by his fondest admirers and his implacable enemies The actions of Julian are faithfully related by a judicious and candid historian the impartial spectator of his life and death The unanimous evidence of his contemporaries is confirmed by the public and private declarations of the emperor himself and his  various writings express the uniform tenor of his religious sentiments which policy would have prompted him to dissemble rather than to affect A devout and sincere attachment for the gods of Athens and Rome constituted the ruling passion of Julian  I shall transcribe some of his own expressions from a short religious discourse which the Imperial pontiff composed to censure the bold impiety of a Cynic  Orat vii p The variety and copiousness of the Greek tongue seems inadequate to the fervour of his devotion  the powers of an enlightened understanding were betrayed and corrupted by the influence of superstitious prejudice and the phantoms which existed only in the mind of the emperor had a real and pernicious effect on the government of the empire The vehement zeal of the Christians who despised the worship and overturned the altars of those fabulous deities engaged their votary in a state of irreconcileable hostility with a very numerous party of his subjects and he was sometimes tempted by the desire of victory or the shame of a repulse to violate the laws of prudence and even of justice The triumph of the party which he deserted and opposed has fixed a stain of infamy on the name of Julian and the unsuccessful apostate has been overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives of which the signal was given by the sonorous trumpet  The orator with some eloquence much enthusiasm and more vanity addresses his discourse to heaven and earth to men and angels to the living and the dead and above all to the great Constantius  an odd Pagan expression He concludes with a bold assurance that he has erected a monument not less durable and much more portable than the columns of Hercules See Greg Nazianzen Orat iii p iv p  of Gregory Nazianzen  See this long invective which has been injudiciously divided into two orations in Gregory's Works tom i p Paris It was published by Gregory and his friend Basil iv p about six months after the death of Julian when his remains had been carried to Tarsus iv p but while Jovian was still on the throne iii p iv p I have derived much assistance from a French version and remarks printed at Lyons  The interesting  nature of the events which were crowded into the short reign of this active emperor deserve a just and circumstantial narrative His motives his counsels and his actions as far as they are connected with the history of religion will be the subject of the present chapter  The cause of his strange and fatal apostacy  His education and apostacy  may be derived from the early period of his life when he was left an orphan in the hands of the murderers of his family The names of Christ and of Constantius the ideas of slavery and of religion were soon associated in a youthful imagination which was susceptible of the most lively impressions The care of his infancy was entrusted to Eusebius bishop of Nicomedia  Nicomediae ab Eusebio educatus Episcopo quem genere longius contingebat Ammian xxii Julian never expresses any gratitude towards that Arian prelate but he celebrates his preceptor the eunuch Mardonius and describes his mode of education which inspired his pupil with a passionate admiration for the genius and perhaps the religion of Homer Misopogon p  who was related to him on the side of his mother and till Julian reached the twentieth year of his age he received from his Christian preceptors  the education not of a hero but of a saint The emperor less jealous of a heavenly than of an earthly crown contented himself with the imperfect character of a catechumen while he bestowed the advantages of baptism  Greg Naz iii p He laboured to efface that holy mark in the blood perhaps of a Taurobolium Baron Annal Eccles A D No  on the nephews of Constantine  Julian himself Epist li p assures the Alexandrians that he had been a Christian he must mean a sincere one till the twentieth year of his age  They were even admitted to the inferior offices of the ecclesiastical order and Julian publicly read the Holy Scriptures in the church of Nicomedia The study of religion which they assiduously cultivated appeared to produce the fairest fruits of faith and devotion  See his Christian and even eccleslastical education in Gregory iii p Socrates l iii c and Sozomen l v c He escaped very narrowly from being a bishop and perhaps a saint  They prayed they fasted they distributed alms to the poor gifts to the clergy and oblations to the tombs of the martyrs and the splendid monument of St Mamas at Caesarea was erected or at least was undertaken by the joint labour of Gallus and Julian  The share of the work which had been allotted to Gallus was prosecuted with vigour and success but the earth obstinately rejected and subverted the structures which were imposed by the sacrilegious hand of Julian Greg iii p Such a partial earthquake attested by many living spectators would form one of the clearest miracles in ecclesiastical story  They respectfully conversed with the bishops who were eminent for superior sanctity and solicited the benediction of the monks and hermits who had introduced into Cappadocia the voluntary hardships  of the ascetic life  The  philosopher  Fragment p ridicules the ironchains c of these solitary fanatics see Tillemont Mem Eccles tom ix p who had forgot that man is by nature a gentle and social animal  The  Pagan  supposes that because they had renounced the gods they were possessed and tormented by evil daemons  As the two princes advanced towards the years of manhood they discovered in their religious sentiments the difference of their characters The dull and obstinate understanding of Gallus embraced with implicit zeal the doctrines of Christianity which never influenced his conduct or moderated his passions The mild disposition of the younger brother was less repugnant to the precepts of the Gospel and his active curiosity might have been gratified by a theological system which explains the mysterious essence of the Deity and opens the boundless prospect of invisible and future worlds But the independent spirit of Julian refused to yield the passive and unresisting obedience which was required in the name of religion by the haughty ministers of the church Their speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws and guarded by the terrors of eternal punishments but while they prescribed the rigid formulary of the thoughts the words and the actions of the young prince whilst they silenced his objections and severely checked the freedom of his enquiries they secretly provoked his impatient genius to disclaim the authority of his ecclesiastical guides He was educated in the Lesser Asia amidst the scandals of the Arian  controversy  See Julian apud Cyril l vi p l viii p  You persecute says he those heretics who do not mourn the dead man precisely in the way which you approve  He shews himself a tolerable theologian but he maintains that the Christian Trinity is not derived from the doctrine of Paul of Jesus or of Moses  The fierce contests of the Eastern bishops the incessant alterations of their creeds and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their conduct insensibly strengthened the prejudice of Julian that they neither understood nor believed the religion for which they so fiercely contended Instead of listening to the proofs of Christianity with that favourable attention which adds weight to the most respectable evidence he heard with suspicion and disputed with obstinacy and acuteness the doctrines for which he already entertained an invincible aversion Whenever the young princes were directed to compose declamations on the subject of the prevailing controversies Julian always declared himself the advocare of Paganism under the specious excuse that in the defence of the weaker cause his learning and ingenuity might be more advantageously exercised and displayed  As soon as Gallus was invested with the honours  He em+braces the mythology of Paganism  of the purple Julian was permitted to breathe the air of freedom of literature and of Paganism  Libanius Orat Parentalis c p c Greg Nazianzen Orat iii p Eunap Vit Sophist in Maximo p Edit Commelin  The crowd of sophists who were attracted by the taste and liberality of their royal pupil had formed a strict alliance between the  learning and the religion of Greece and the poems of Homer instead of being admired as the original productions of human genius were seriously ascribed to the heavenly inspiration of Apollo and the muses The deities of Olympus as they are painted by the immortal bard imprint themselves on the minds which are the least addicted to superstitious credulity Our familiar knowledge of their names and characters their forms and attributes  seems  to bestow on those airy beings a real and substantial existence and the pleasing enchantment produces an imperfect and momentary assent of the imagination to those fables which are the most repugnant to our reason and experience In the age of Julian every circumstance contributed to prolong and fortify the illusion the magnificent temples of Greece and Asia the works of those artists who had expressed in painting or in sculpture the divine conceptions of the poet the pomp of festivals and sacrifices the successful arts of divination the popular traditions of oracles and prodigies and the ancient practice of two thousand years The weakness of polytheism was in some measure excused by the moderation of its claims and the devotion of the Pagans was not incompatible with the most licentious scepticism  A modern philosophér has ingeniously compared the different operation of theism and polytheism with regard to the doubt or conviction which they produce in the human mind See Hume's Essays vol ii p in vo edit  Instead of an indivisible and regular system  which occupies the whole extent of the believing mind the mythology of the Greeks was composed of a thousand loose and flexible parts and the servant of the gods was at liberty to define the degree and measure of his religious faith The creed which Julian adopted for his own use was of the largest dimensions and by a strange contradiction he disdained the salutary yoke of the Gospel whilst he made a voluntary offering of his reason on the altars of Jupiter and Apollo One of the orations of Julian is consecrated to the honour of Cybele the mother of the gods who required from her effeminate priests the bloody sacrifice so rashly performed by the madness of the Phrygian boy The pious emperor condescends to relate without a blush and without a smile the voyage of the goddess from the shores of Pergamus to the mouth of the Tyber and the stupendous miracle which convinced the senate and people of Rome that the lump of clay which their ambassadors had transported over the seas was endowed with life and sentiment and divine power  The Idaean mother landed in Italy about the end of the second Punic war The miracle of Claudia either virgin or matron who cleared her fame by disgracing the graver modesty of the Roman ladies is attested by a cloud of witnesses Their evidence is collected by Drakenborch ad Silium Italicum xvii but we may observe that Livy xxix slides over the transaction with discreet ambiguity  For the truth of this prodigy he appeals to the public monuments of the city and censures with some acrimony the sickly and affected taste of those  men who impertinently derided the sacred traditions  The allegories  of their ancestors  I cannot refrain from transcribing the emphatical words of Julian  Orat v p Julian likewise declares his firm belief in the  ancilia  the holy shields which dropt from heaven on the Quirinal hill and pities the strange blindness of the Christians who preferred the  cross  to these celestial trophies Apud Cyril l vi p    But the devout philosopher who sincerely embraced and warmly encouraged the superstition of the people reserved for himself the privilege of a liberal interpretation and silently withdrew from the foot of the altars into the sanctuary of the temple The extravagance of the Grecian mythology proclaimed with a clear and audible voice that the pious enquirer instead of being scandalized or satisfied with the literal sense should diligently explore the occult wisdom which had been disguised by the prudence of antiquity under the mask of folly and of fable  See the principles of allegory in Julian Orat vii p His reasoning is less absurd than that of some modern theologians who assert that an extravagant or contradictory doctrine  must  be divine since no man alive could have thought of inventing it  The philosophers of the Platonic school  Eunapius has made these sophists the subject of a partial and fanatical history and the learned Brucker Hist Philosoph tom ii p has employed much labour to illustrate their obscure lives and incomprehensible doctrines  Plotinus Porphyry and the divine Iamblichus were admired as the most skilful masters of this allegorical science which laboured to soften and harmonize the deformed features of paganism Julian himself who was directed in the mysterious pursuit by Aedesius the venerable successor  of Iamblichus aspired to the possession of a treasure which he esteemed if we may credit his solemn asseverations far above the empire of the world  Julian Orat vii p He swears with the most fervent and enthusiastic devotion and trembles lest he should betray too much of these holy mysteries which the profane might deride with an impious Sardonic laugh  It was indeed a treasure which derived its value only from opinion and every artist who flattered himself that he had extracted the precious ore from the surrounding dross claimed an equal right of stamping the name and figure the most agreeable to his peculiar fancy The fable of Atys and Cybele had been already explained by Porphyry but his labours served only to animate the pious industry of Julian who invented and published his own allegory of that ancient and mystic tale This freedom of interpretation which might gratify the pride of the Platonists exposed the vanity of their art Without a tedious detail the modern reader could not form a just idea of the strange allusions the forced etymologies the solemn trifling and the impenetrable obscurity of these sages who professed to reveal the system of the universe As the traditions of pagan mythology were variously related the sacred interpreters were at liberty to select the most convenient circumstances and as they translated an arbitrary cypher they could extract from  any  fable  any  sense which was adapted to their favourite system of religion and philosophy The lascivious form of a naked Venus was tortured into the discovery  of some moral precept or some physical truth and the castration of Atys explained the revolution of the sun between the tropics or the separation of the human soul from vice and error  See the fifth oration of Julian But all the allegories which ever issued from the Platonic school are not worth the short poem of Catullus on the same extraordinary subject The transition of Atys from the wildest enthusiasm to sober pathetic complaint for his irretrievable loss must inspire a man with pity an eunuch with despair    The theological system of Julian appears to have contained the sublime and important principles  Theological system of Julian  of natural religion But as the faith which is not founded on revelation must remain destitute of any firm assurance the disciple of Plato imprudently relapsed into the habits of vulgar superstition and the popular and philosophic notion of the Deity seems to have been confounded in the practice the writings and even in the mind of Julian  The true religion of Julian may be deduced from the Caesars p with Spanheim's notes and illustrations from the fragments in Cyril l ii p and especially from the theological oration in Solem Regem p addressed in the confidence of friendship to the praefect Sallust  The pious emperor acknowledged and adored the Eternal Cause of the universe to whom he ascribed all the perfections of an infinite nature invisible to the eyes and inaccessible to the understanding of feeble mortals The Supreme God had created or rather in the Platonic language had generated the gradual succession of dependent spirits of gods of daemons of heroes and of men and every being which derived its existence immediately from the First Cause received the inherent  gift of immortality That so precious an advantage might not be lavished upon unworthy objects the Creator had entrusted to the skill and power of the inferior gods the office of forming the human body and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms To the conduct of these divine ministers he delegated the temporal government of this lower world but their imperfect administration is not exempt from discord or error The earth and its inhabitants are divided among them and the characters of Mars or Minerva of Mercury or Venus may be distinctly traced in the laws and manners of their peculiar votaries As long as our immortal souls are confined in a mortal prison it is our interest as well as our duty to solicit the favour and to deprecate the wrath of the powers of heaven whose pride is gratified by the devotion of mankind and whose grosser parts may be supposed to derive some nourishment from the fumes of sacrifice  Julian adopts this gross conception by ascribing it to his favourite Marcus Antoninus Caesares p The Stoics and Platonists hesitated between the analogy of bodies and the purity of spirits yet the gravest philosophers inclined to the whimsical fancy of Aristophanes and Lucian that an unbelieving age might starve the immortal gods See Observations de Spanheim p c  The inferior gods might sometimes condescend to animate the statues and to inhabit the temples which were dedicated to their honour They might occasionally visit the earth but the heavens were the proper throne and symbol of their glory The invariable order of the  sun moon and stars was hastily admitted by Julian as a proof of their  eternal  duration and their eternity was a sufficient evidence that they were the workmanship not of an inferior deity but of the Omnipotent King In the system of the Platonists the visible was a type of the invisible world The celestial bodies as they were informed by a divine spirit might be considered as the objects the most worthy of religious worship The SUN whose genial influence pervades and sustains the universe justly claimed the adoration of mankind as the bright representative of the LOGOS the lively the rational the beneficent image of the intellectual Father  Julian epist xli In another place apud Cyril l ii p he calls the Sun God and the throne of God Julian believed the Platonician Trinity and only blames the Christians for preferring a mortal to an immortal  Logos    In every age the absence of genuine inspiration  Fanaticism of the philosophers  is supplied by the strong illusions of enthusiasm and the mimic arts of imposture If in the time of Julian these arts had been practised only by the pagan priests for the support of an expiring cause some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to the interest and habits of the sacerdotal character But it may appear a subject of surprise and scandal that the philosophers themselves should have contributed to abuse the superstitious credulity of mankind  The sophists of Eunapius perform as many miracles as the saints of the desert and the only circumstance in their favour is that they are of a less gloomy complexion Instead of devils with horns and tails Iamblichus evoked the genii of love Eros and Anteros from two adjacent fountains Two beautiful boys issued from the water fondly embraced him as their father and retired at his command P  and that the  Grecian mysteries should have been supported by the magic or theurgy of the modern Platonists They arrogantly pretended to controul the order of nature to explore the secrets of futurity to command the service of the inferior daemons to enjoy the view and conversation of the superior gods and by disengaging the soul from her material bands to reunite that immortal particle with the Infinite and Divine Spirit  The devout and fearless curiosity of Julian  Initiation and fanaticism of Julian  tempted the philosophers with the hopes of an easy conquest which from the situation of their young proselyte might be productive of the most important consequences  The dexterous management of these sophists who played their credulous pupil into each other's hands is fairly told by Eunapius p with unsuspecting simplicity The Abbé de la Bleterie understands and neatly describes the whole comedy Vie de Julien p  Julian imbibed the first rudiments of the Platonic doctrines from the mouth of Aedesius who had fixed at Pergamus his wandering and persecuted school But as the declining strength of that venerable sage was unequal to the ardour the diligence the rapid conception of his pupil two of his most learned disciples Chrysanthes and Eusebius supplied at his own desire the place of their aged master These philosophers seem to have prepared and distributed their respective parts and they artfully contrived by dark hints and affected  disputes to excite the impatient hopes of the  aspirant  till they delivered him into the hands of their associate Maximus the boldest and most skilful master of the Theurgic science By his hands Julian was secretly initiated at Ephesus in the twentieth year of his age His residence at Athens confirmed this unnatural alliance of philosophy and superstition He obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the mysteries of Eleusis which amidst the general decay of the Grecian worship still retained some vestiges of their primaeval sanctity and such was the zeal of Julian that he afterwards invited the Eleusinian pontiff to the court of Gaul for the sole purpose of consummating by mystic rites and sacrifices the great work of his sanctification As these ceremonies were performed in the depth of caverns and in the silence of the night and as the inviolable secret of the mysteries was preserved by the discretion of the initiated I shall not presume to describe the horrid sounds and fiery apparitions which were presented to the senses or the imagination of the credulous aspirant  When Julian in a momentary panic made the sign of the cross the daemons instantly disappeared Greg Naz Orat iii p Gregory supposes that they were frightened but the priests declared that they were indignant The reader according to the measure of his faith will determine this profound question  till the visions of comfort and knowledge broke upon him in a blaze of celestial light  A dark and distant view of the terrors and joys of initiation is shewn by Dion Chrysostom Themistius Proclus and Stobaeus The learned author of the Divine Legation has exhibited their words vol i p edit which he dexterously or forcibly applies to his own hypothesis  In the caverns of Ephesus and  Eleusis the mind of Julian was penetrated with sincere deep and unalterable enthusiasm though he might sometimes exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy which may be observed or at least suspected in the characters of the most conscientious fanatics From that moment he consecrated his life to the service of the gods and while the occupations of war of government and of study seemed to claim the whole measure of his time a stated portion of the hours of the night was invariably reserved for the exercise of private devotion The temperance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and the philosopher was connected with some strict and frivolous rules of religious abstinence and it was in honour of Pan or Mercury of Hecate or Isis that Julian on particular days denied himself the use of some particular food which might have been offensive to his tutelar deities By these voluntary fasts he prepared his senses and his understanding for the frequent and familiar visits with which he was honoured by the celestial powers Notwithstanding the modest silence of Julian himself we may learn from his faithful friend the orator Libanius that he lived in a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses that they descended upon earth to enjoy the conversation of their favourite hero that they gently interrupted his slumbers by touching his hand or his hair that  they warned him of every impending danger and conducted him by their infallible wisdom in every action of his life and that he had acquired such an intimate knowledge of his heavenly guests as readily to distinguish the voice of Jupiter from that of Minerva and the form of Apollo from the figure of Hercules  Julian's modesty confined him to obscure and occasional hints but Libanius expatiates with pleasure on the fasts and visions of the religious hero Legat ad Julian p and Orat Parental c lxxxiii p  These sleeping or waking visions the ordinary effects of abstinence and fanaticism would almost degrade the emperor to the level of an Egyptian monk But the useless lives of Antony or Pachomius were consumed in these vain occupations Julian could break from the dream of superstition to arm himself for battle and after vanquishing in the field the enemies of Rome he calmly retired into his tent to dictate the wise and salutary laws of an empire or to indulge his genius in the elegant pursuits of literature and philosophy  The important secret of the apostacy of Julian  His religious dissimulation  was entrusted to the fidelity of the  initiated  with whom he was united by the sacred ties of friendship and religion  Libanius Orat Parent c x p Gallus had some reason to suspect the secret apostacy of his brother and in a letter which may be received as genuine he exhorts Julian to adhere to the religion of their  ancestors  an argument which as it should seem was not yet perfectly ripe See Julian Op p and Hist de Jovien tom ii p  The pleasing rumour was cautiously circulated among the adherents of the ancient worship and his future greatness became  the object of the hopes the prayers and the predictions of the pagans in every province of the empire From the zeal and virtues of their royal proselyte they fondly expected the cure of every evil and the restoration of every blessing and instead of disapproving of the ardour of their pious wishes Julian ingenuously confessed that he was ambitious to attain a situation in which he might be useful to his country and to his religion But this religion was viewed with an hostile eye by the successor of Constantine whose capricious passions alternately saved and threatened the life of Julian The arts of magic and divination were strictly prohibited under a despotic government which condescended to fear them and if the pagans were reluctantly indulged in the exercise of their superstition the rank of Julian would have excepted him from the general toleration The apostate soon became the presumptive heir of the monarchy and his death could alone have appeased the just apprehensions of the Christians  Gregory iii p with inhuman zeal censures Constantius for sparing the infant apostate  His French translator p cautiously observes that such expressions must not be prises à la lettre  But the young prince who aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of a martyr consulted his safety by dissembling his religion and the easy temper of polytheism permitted him to join in the public worship of a sect which he inwardly despised Libanius has considered the hypocrisy of his friend as a subject not of censure but of praise  As the statues of the gods says that orator which have been defiled with filth are again placed in a magnificent temple so the beauty of truth was seated in the mind of Julian after it had been purified from the errors and follies of his education His sentiments were changed but as it would have been dangerous to have avowed his sentiments his conduct still continued the same Very different from the ass in Aesop who disguised himself with a lion's hide our lion was obliged to conceal himself under the skin of an ass and while he embraced the dictates of reason to obey the laws of prudence and necessity  Libanius Orat Parental c ix p    The dissimulation of Julian lasted above ten years from his secret initiation at Ephesus to the beginning of the civil war when he declared himself at once the implacable enemy of Christ and of Constantius This state of constraint might contribute to strengthen his devotion and as soon as he had satisfied the obligation of assisting on solemn festivals at the assemblies of the Christians Julian returned with the impatience of a lover to burn his free and voluntary incense on the domestic chapels of Jupiter and Mercury But as every act of dissimulation must be painful to an ingenuous spirit the profession of Christianity encreased the aversion of Julian for a religion which oppressed the freedom of his mind and compelled him to hold a conduct repugnant to the noblest attributes of human nature sincerity and courage  The inclination of Julian might prefer the gods of Homer and of the Scipios to the new faith which his uncle had established in the  He writes against Christianity  Roman empire and in which he himself had been sanctified by the sacrament of baptism But as a philosopher it was incumbent on him to justify his dissent from Christianity which was supported by the number of its converts by the chain of prophecy the splendour of miracles and the weight of evidence The elaborate work  Fabricius Biblioth Graec l v c viii p and Lardner Heathen Testimonies vol iv p have accurately compiled all that can now be discovered of Julian's work against the Christians  which he composed amidst the preparations of the Persian war contained the substance of those arguments which he had long revolved in his mind Some fragments have been transcribed and preserved by his adversary the vehement Cyril of Alexandria  About seventy years after the death of Julian he executed a task which had been feebly attempted by Philip of Side a prolix and contemptible writer Even the work of Cyril has not entirely satisfied the most favourable judges and the Abbé de la Bleterie Preface à l'Hist de Jovien p wishes that some  theologien philosophe  a strange centaur would undertake the refutation of Julian  and they exhibit a very singular mixture of wit and learning of sophistry and fanaticism The elegance of the style and the rank of the author recommended his writings to the public attention  Libanius Orat Parental c lxxxxvii p who has been suspected of assisting his friend prefers this divine vindication Orat ix in necem Julian p edit Morel to the writings of Porphyry His judgment may be arraigned Socrates l iii c but Libanius cannot be accused of flattery to a dead prince  and in the impious list of the enemies of Christianity  the celebrated name of Porphyry was effaced by the superior merit or reputation of Julian The minds of the faithful were either seduced or scandalized or alarmed and the pagans who sometimes presumed to engage in the unequal dispute derived from the popular work of their Imperial missionary an inexhaustible supply of fallacious objections But in the assiduous prosecution of these theological studies the emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of a polemic divine He contracted an irrevocable obligation to maintain and propagate his religious opinions and whilst he secretly applauded the strength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of controversy he was tempted to distrust the sincerity or to despise the understandings of his antagonists who could obstinately resist the force of reason and eloquence  The Christians who beheld with horror and  Universal toleration  indignation the apostacy of Julian had much more to fear from his power than from his arguments The pagans who were conscious of his fervent zeal expected perhaps with impatience that the flames of persecution should be immediately kindled against the enemies of the gods and that the ingenious malice of Julian would invent some cruel refinements of death and torture which had been unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors But the hopes as well as the fears of the religious factions were apparently disappointed by the  prudent humanity of a prince  Libanius Orat Parent c lviii p has eloquently explained the tolerating principles and conduct of his Imperial friend In a very remarkable epistle to the people of Bostra Julian himself epist lii professes his moderation and betrays his zeal which is acknowledged by Ammianus and exposed by Gregory Orat iii p  who was careful of his own fame of the public peace and of the rights of mankind Instructed by history and reflection Julian was persuaded that if the diseases of the body may sometimes be cured by salutary violence neither steel nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of the mind The reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar but the heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the hand Religious obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by oppression and as soon as the persecution subsides those who have yielded are restored as penitents and those who have resisted are honoured as saints and martyrs If Julian adopted the unsuccessful cruelty of Diocletian and his colleagues he was sensible that he should stain his memory with the name of tyrant and add new glories to the Catholic church which had derived strength and encrease from the severity of the pagan magistrates Actuated by these motives and apprehensive of disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign Julian surprised the world by an edict which was not unworthy of a statesman or a philosopher He extended to all the inhabitants of the Roman world the benefits of a free and equal toleration and the only hardship  which he inflicted on the Christians was to deprive them of the power of tormenting their fellowsubjects whom they stigmatised with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics The Pagans received a gracious permission or rather an express order to open ALL their temples  In Greece the temples of Minerva were opened by his express command before the death of Constantius Liban Orat Parent c p and Julian declares himself a pagan in his public manifesto to the Athenians This unquestionable evidence may correct the hasty assertion of Ammianus who seems to suppose Constantinople to be the place where he discovered his attachment to the gods  and they were at once delivered from the oppressive laws and arbitrary vexations which they had sustained under the reign of Constantine and of his sons At the same time the bishops and clergy who had been banished by the Arian monarch were recalled from exile and restored to their respective churches the Donatists the Novatians the Macedonians the Eunomians and those who with a more prosperous fortune adhered to the doctrine of the council of Nice Julian who understood and derided their theological disputes invited to the palace the leaders of the hostile sects that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their furious encounters The clamour of controversy sometimes provoked the emperor to exclaim  Hear me the Franks have heard me and the Alemanni  but he soon discovered that he was now engaged with more obstinate and implacable enemies and though he exerted the powers of oratory to persuade them to live in concord or at least in peace he was perfectly satisfied before he dismissed  them from his presence that he had nothing to dread from the union of the Christians The impartial Ammianus has ascribed this affected clemency to the desire of fomenting the intestine divisions of the church and the insidious design of undermining the foundations of Christianity was inseparably connected with the zeal which Julian professed to restore the ancient religion of the empire  Ammianus xxii Sozomen l v c Bestia moritur tranquillitas redit omnes episcopi qui de propriis sedibus fuerant exterminati per indulgentiam novi principis ad ecclesias redeunt Jerom adversus Luciferianos tom ii p Optatus accuses the Donatists for owing their safety to an apostate l ii c p edit Dupin    As soon as he ascended the throne he assumed  Zeal and devotion of Julian in the restoration of paganism  according to the custom of his predecessors the character of supreme pontiff not only as the most honourable title of Imperial greatness but as a sacred and important office the duties of which he was resolved to execute with pious diligence As the business of the state prevented the emperor from joining every day in the public devotion of his subjects he dedicated a domestic chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun his gardens were filled with statues and altars of the gods and each apartment of the palace displayed the appearance of a magnificent temple Every morning he saluted the parent of light with a sacrifice the blood of another victim was shed at the moment when the Sun sunk below the horizon and the Moon the Stars and the Genii of the night received their  respective and seasonable honours from the indefatigable devotion of Julian On solemn festivals he regularly visited the temple of the god or goddess to whom the day was peculiarly consecrated and endeavoured to excite the religion of the magistrates and people by the example of his own zeal Instead of maintaining the lofty state of a monarch distinguished by the splendor of his purple and encompassed by the golden shields of his guards Julian solicited with respectful eagerness the meanest offices which contributed to the worship of the gods Amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests of inferior ministers and of female dancers who were dedicated to the service of the temple it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood to blow the fire to handle the knife to slaughter the victim and thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal to draw forth the heart or liver and to read with the consummate skill of an haruspex the imaginary signs of future events The wisest of the pagans censured this extravagant superstition which affected to despise the restraints of prudence and decency Under the reign of a prince who practised the rigid maxims of oeconomy the expence of religious worship consumed a very large portion of the revenue a constant supply of the scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from distant climates to bleed on the altars of the gods an hundred oxen were frequently sacrificed by Julian on one and the same day and it soon became a popular jest that if he should return  with conquest from the Persian war the breed of horned cattle must infallibly be extinguished Yet this expence may appear inconsiderable when it is compared with the splendid presents which were offered either by the hand or by order of the emperor to all the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman world and with the sums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient temples which had suffered the silent decay of time or the recent injuries of Christian rapine Encouraged by the example the exhortations the liberality of their pious sovereign the cities and families resumed the practice of their neglected ceremonies  Every part of the world exclaims Libanius with devout transport displayed the triumph of religion and the grateful prospect of flaming altars bleeding victims the smoke of incense and a solemn train of priests and prophets without fear and without danger The sound of prayer and of music was heard on the tops of the highest mountains and the same ox afforded a sacrifice for the gods and a supper for their joyous votaries  The restoration of the Pagan worship is described by Julian Misopogon p Libanius Orat Parent c p and Orat Consular ad Julian p edit Morel Ammianus xxii and Gregory Nazianzen Orat iv p These writers agree in the essential and even minute facts but the different lights in which they view the extreme devotion of Julian are expressive of the gradations of selfapplause passionate admiration mild reproof and partial invective    But the genius and power of Julian were unequal  Reformation of paganism  to the enterprise of restoring a religion  which was destitute of theological principles of moral precepts and of ecclesiastical discipline which rapidly hastened to decay and dissolution and was not susceptible of any solid or consistent reformation The jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff more especially after that office had been united with the Imperial dignity comprehended the whole extent of the Roman empire Julian named for his vicars in the several provinces the priests and philosophers whom he esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution of his great design and his pastoral letters  See Julian Epistol xlix lxii lxiii and a long and curious fragment without beginning or end p The supreme pontiff derides the Mosaic history and the Christian discipline prefers the Greek poets to the Hebrew prophets and palliates with the skill of a Jesuit the  relative  worship of images  if we may use that name still represent a very curious sketch of his wishes and intentions He directs that in every city the sacerdotal order should be composed without any distinction of birth or fortune of those persons who were the most conspicuous for their love of the gods and of men  If they are guilty continues he of any scandalous offence they should be censured or degraded by the superior pontiff but as long as they retain their rank they are entitled to the respect of the magistrates and people Their humility may be shewn in the plainness of their domestic garb their dignity in the pomp of holy vestments When they are summoned in their turn to officiate before the altar they ought not during the  appointed number of days to depart from the precincts of the temple nor should a single day be suffered to elapse without the prayers and the sacrifice which they are obliged to offer for the prosperity of the state and of individuals The exercise of their sacred functions requires an immaculate purity both of mind and body and even when they are dismissed from the temple to the occupations of common life it is incumbent on them to excel in decency and virtue the rest of their fellowcitizens The priest of the gods should never be seen in theatres or taverns His conversation should be chaste his diet temperate his friends of honourable reputation and if he sometimes visits the Forum or the Palace he should appear only as the advocate of those who have vainly solicited either justice or mercy His studies should be suited to the sanctity of his profession Licentious tales or comedies or satires must be banished from his library which ought solely to consist of historical and philosophical writings of history which is founded in truth and of philosophy which is connected with religion The impious opinions of the Epicureans and Sceptics deserve his abhorrence and contempt  The exultation of Julian p that these impious sects and even their writings are extinguished may be consistent enough with the sacerdotal character but it is unworthy of a philosopher to wish that any opinions and arguments the most repugnant to his own should be concealed from the knowledge of mankind  but he should diligently study the  systems of Pythagoras of Plato and of the Stoics which unanimously teach that there  are  gods that the world is governed by their providence that their goodness is the source of every temporal blessing and that they have prepared for the human soul a future state of reward or punishment  The Imperial pontiff inculcates in the most persuasive language the duties of benevolence and hospitality exhorts his inferior clergy to recommend the universal practice of those virtues promises to assist their indigence from the public treasury and declares his resolution of establishing hospitals in every city where the poor should be received without any invidious distinction of country or of religion Julian beheld with envy the wise and humane regulations of the church and he very frankly confesses his intention to deprive the Christians of the applause as well as advantage which they had acquired by the exclusive practice of charity and beneficence  Yet he insinuates that the Christians under the pretence of charity inveigled children from their religion and parents conveyed them on shipboard and devoted those victims to a life of poverty or servitude in a remote country p Had the charge been proved it was his duty not to complain but to punish  The same spirit of imitation might dispose the emperor to adopt several ecclesiastical institutions the use and importance of which were approved by the success of his enemies But if these imaginary plans of reformation had been realized the forced and imperfect copy would have been less beneficial  to Paganism than honourable to Christianity  Gregory Nazianzen is facetious ingenious and argumentative Orat iii p c He ridicules the folly of such vain imitation and amuses himself with inquiring what lessons moral or theological could be extracted from the Grecian fables  The Gentiles who peaceably followed the customs of their ancestors were rather surprised than pleased with the introduction of foreign manners and in the short period of his reign Julian had frequent occasions to complain of the want of fervour of his own party  He accuses one of his pontiffs of a secret confederacy with the Christian bishops and presbyters Epist lxii  and again  c Epist lxiii    The enthusiasm of Julian prompted him to  The philosophers  embrace the friends of Jupiter as his personal friends and brethren and though he partially overlooked the merit of Christian constancy he admired and rewarded the noble perseverance of those Gentiles who had preferred the favour of the gods to that of the emperor  He praises the fidelity of Callixene priestess of Ceres who had been twice as constant as Penelope and rewards her with the priesthood of the Phrygian goddess at Pessinus Julian Epist xxi He applauds the firmness of Sopater of Hierapolis who had been repeatedly pressed by Constantius and Gallus to  apostatize  Epist xxvii p  If they cultivated the literature as well as the religion of the Greeks they acquired an additional claim to the friendship of Julian who ranked the Muses in the number of his tutelar deities In the religion which he had adopted piety and learning were almost synonimous  Orat Parent c p The same sentiment is frequently inculcated by Julian Libanius and the rest of their party  and a crowd of poets  of rhetoricians and of philosophers hastened to the Imperial court to occupy the vacant places of the bishops who had seduced the credulity of Constantius His successor esteemed the ties of common initiation as far more sacred than those of consanguinity he chose his favourites among the sages who were deeply skilled in the occult sciences of magic and divination and every impostor who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity was assured of enjoying the present hour in honour and affluence  The curiosity and credulity of the emperor who tried every mode of divination are fairly exposed by Ammianus xxii  Among the philosophers Maximus obtained the most eminent rank in the friendship of his royal disciple who communicated with unreserved confidence his actions his sentiments and his religious designs during the anxious suspense of the civil war  Julian Epist xxxviii Three other epistles xv xvi xxxix in the same style of friendship and confidence are addressed to the philosopher Maximus  As soon as Julian had taken possession of the palace of Constantinople he dispatched an honourable and pressing invitation to Maximus who then resided at Sardes in Lydia with Chrysanthius the associate of his art and studies The prudent and superstitious Chrysanthius refused to undertake a journey which shewed itself according to the rules of divination with the most threatening and malignant aspect but his companion whose fanaticism was of a bolder cast persisted in his interrogations till he had extorted from the gods a seeming  consent to his own wishes and those of the emperor The journey of Maximus through the cities of Asia displayed the triumph of philosophic vanity and the magistrates vied with each other in the honourable reception which they prepared for the friend of their sovereign Julian was pronouncing an oration before the senate when he was informed of the arrival of Maximus The emperor immediately interrupted his discourse advanced to meet him and after a tender embrace conducted him by the hand into the midst of the assembly where he publicly acknowledged the benefits which he had derived from the instructions of the philosopher Maximus  Eunapius in Maximo p and in Chrysanthio p has minutely related these anecdotes which he conceives to be the most important events of the age Yet he fairly confesses the frailty of Maximus His reception at Constantinople is described by Libanius Orat Parent c p and Ammianus xxii  who soon acquired the confidence and influenced the councils of Julian was insensibly corrupted by the temptations of a court His dress became more splendid his demeanour more lofty and he was exposed under a succeeding reign to a disgraceful inquiry into the means by which the disciple of Plato had accumulated in the short duration of his favour a very scandalous proportion of wealth Of the other philosophers and sophists who were invited to the Imperial residence by the choice of Julian or by the success of Maximus few were able to  preserve their innocence or their reputation  Chrysanthius who had refused to quit Lydia was created highpriest of the province His cautious and temperate use of power secured him after the revolution and he lived in peace while Maximus Priscus c were persecuted by the Christian ministers See the adventures of those fanatic sophists collected by Brucker tom ii p  The liberal gifts of money lands and houses were insufficient to satiate their rapacious avarice and the indignation of the people was justly excited by the remembrance of their abject poverty and disinterested professions The penetration of Julian could not always be deceived but he was unwilling to despise the characters of those men whose talents deserved his esteem he desired to escape the double reproach of imprudence and inconstancy and he was apprehensive of degrading in the eyes of the profane the honour of letters and of religion  See Libanius Orat Parent c p and Eunapius Vit Sophist in Proaeresio p Some students whose expectations perhaps were groundless or extravagant retired in disgust Greg Naz Orat iv p It is strange that we should not be able to contradict the title of one of Tillemont's chapters Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  La Cour de Julien est pleine de philosophes et de gens perdûs    The favour of Julian was almost equally divided  Conversions  between the Pagans who had firmly adhered to the worship of their ancestors and the Christians who prudently embraced the religion of their sovereign The acquisition of new proselytes  Under the reign of Lewis XIV his subjects of every rank aspired to the glorious title of  Convertisscur  expressive of their zeal and success in making proselytes The word and the idea are growing obsolete in France may they never be introduced into England  gratified the ruling passions

should not esteem himself the benefactor of mankind unless at the same time he could reclaim his subjects from their impious revolt against the immortal gods  See the strong expressions of Libanius which were probably those of Julian himself Orat Parent c p  A prince who had studied human nature and who possessed the treasures of the Roman empire could adapt his arguments his promises and his rewards to every order of Christians  When Gregory Nazianzen Orat x p is desirous to magnify the Christian firmness of his brother Caesarius physician to the Imperial court he owns that Caesarius disputed with a formidable adversary  In his invectives he scarcely allows any share of wit or courage to the apostate  and the merit of a seasonable conversion was allowed to supply the defects of a candidate or even to expiate the guilt of a criminal As the army is the most forcible engine of absolute power Julian applied himself with peculiar diligence to corrupt the religion of his troops without whose hearty concurrence every measure must be dangerous and unsuccessful and the natural temper of soldiers made this conquest as easy as it was important The legions of Gaul devoted themselves to the faith as well as to the fortunes of their victorious leader and even before the death of Constantius he had the satisfaction of announcing to his friends that they assisted with  fervent devotion and voracious appetite at the sacrifices which were repeatedly offered in his camp of whole hecatombs of fat oxen  Julian Epist xxxviii Ammianus xxii Adeo ut in dies paene singulos milites carnis distentiore sagina victitantes incultius potusque aviditate correpti humeris impositi transeuntium per plateas ex publicis aedibus ad sua diversoria portarentur The devout prince and the indignant historian describe the same scene and in Illyricum or Antioch similar causes must have produced similar effects  The armies of the East which had been trained under the standard of the cross and of Constantius required a more artful and expensive mode of persuasion On the days of solemn and public festivals the emperor received the homage and rewarded the merit of the troops His throne of state was encircled with the military ensigns of Rome and the republic the holy name of Christ was erazed from the  Labarum  and the symbols of war of majesty and of pagan superstition were so dexterously blended that the faithful subject incurred the guilt of idolatry when he respectfully saluted the person or image of his sovereign The soldiers passed successively in review and each of them before he received from the hand of Julian a liberal donative proportioned to his rank and services was required to cast a few grains of incense into the flame which burnt upon the altar Some Christian confessors might resist and others might repent but the far greater number allured by the prospect of gold and awed by the presence of the emperor contracted the criminal engagement  and their future perseverance in the worship of the gods was enforced by every consideration of duty and of interest By the frequent repetition of these arts and at the expence of sums which would have purchased the service of half the nations of Scythia Julian gradually acquired for his troops the imaginary protection of the gods and for himself the firm and effectual support of the Roman legions  Gregory Orat iii p and Libanius Orat Parent c lxxxi lxxxii p  The sophist owns and justifies the expence of these military conversions  It is indeed more than probable that the restoration and encouragement of Paganism revealed a multitude of pretended Christians who from motives of temporal advantage had acquiesced in the religion of the former reign and who afterwards returned with the same flexibility of conscience to the faith which was professed by the successors of Julian  While the devout monarch incessantly laboured  The Jews  to restore and propagate the religion of his ancestors he embraced the extraordinary design of rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem In a public epistle  Julian's epistle xxv is addressed to the community of the Jews Aldus Venet has branded it with an  but this stigma is justly removed by the subsequent editors Petavius and Spanheim The epistle is mentioned by Sozomen l v c and the purport of it is confirmed by Gregory Orat iv p and by Julian himself Fragment p  to the nation or community of the Jews dispersed through the provinces he pities their misfortunes condemns their oppressors praises their constancy declares himself their

toises  A plan taken on the spot assigns no more than for the modern town The circuit is defined by natural landmarks which cannot be mistaken or removed  Towards the south the upper town and the fortress of David were erected on the lofty ascent of Mount Sion on the north side the buildings of the lower town covered the spacious summit of Mount Acra and a part of the hill distinguished by the name of Moriah and levelled by human industry was crowned with the stately temple of the Jewish nation After the final destruction of the temple  by the arms of Titus and Hadrian a ploughshare was drawn over the consecrated ground as a sign of perpetual interdiction Sion was deserted and the vacant space of the lower city was filled with the public and private edifices of the Aelian colony which spread themselves over the adjacent hill of Calvary The holy places were polluted with monuments of idolatry and either from design or accident a chapel was dedicated to Venus on the spot which

Almost three hundred years after those stupendous events the profane chapel of Venus was demolished by the order of Constantine and the removal of the earth and stones revealed the holy sepulchre to

heroes who have visited the memorable scenes of ancient wisdom or glory have confessed the inspiration of the genius of the place  Cicero de Finibus v has beautifully expressed the common sense of mankind  and the Christian who knelt before the holy sepulchre ascribed his lively faith and his fervent devotion to the more immediate influence of the Divine spirit The zeal perhaps the avarice of the clergy of Jerusalem cherished and multiplied these beneficial visits They fixed by unquestionable tradition the scene of each memorable event They exhibited the instruments which had been used in the passion of Christ the nails and the lance that had pierced his hands his feet and his side the crown of thorns that was planted on his head the pillar at which he was scourged and above all they shewed the cross on which he suffered and which was dug out of the earth in the reign of those princes who inserted the symbol of Christianity in the banners of the Roman legions  Baronius Annal Eccles A D No and Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p are the historians and champions of the miraculous  invention  of the cross under the reign of Constantine Their oldest witnesses are Paulinus Sulpicius Severus Rufinus Ambrose and perhaps Cyril of Jerusalem The silence of Eusebius and the Bourdeaux pilgrim which satisfies those who think perplexes those who believe See Jortin's sensible remarks vol ii p  Such miracles as seemed necessary to  account for its extraordinary preservation and seasonable discovery were gradually propagated without opposition The custody of the  true cross  which on Easter Sunday was solemnly exposed to the people was entrusted to the bishop of Jerusalem and he alone might gratify the curious devotion of the pilgrims by the gift of small pieces which they enchased in gold or gems and carried away in triumph to their respective countries But as this gainful branch of commerce must soon have been annihilated it was found convenient to suppose that the marvellous wood possessed a secret power of vegetation and that its substance though continually diminished still remained entire and unimpaired  This multiplication is asserted by Paulinus epist

Erasmi Opera tom i p Lugd Batav in Colloq de Peregrinat Religionis ergo saints heads c and other relics which were repeated in so many different churches  It might perhaps have been expected that the influence of the place and the belief of a perpetual miracle should have produced some salutary effects on the morals as well as on the faith of the people Yet the most respectable of the ecclesiastical writers have been obliged to confess not only that the streets of Jerusalem  were filled with the incessant tumult of business and pleasure  Jerom tom i p who resided in the neighbouring village of Bethlem describes the vices of Jerusalem from his personal experience  but that every species of vice adultery theft idolatry poisoning murder was familiar to the inhabitants of the holy city  Gregor Nyssen apud Wesseling p The whole epistle which condemns either the use or the abuse of religious pilgrimage is painful to the Catholic divines while it is dear and familiar to our Protestant polemics  The wealth and preeminence of the church of Jerusalem excited the ambition of Arian as well as orthodox candidates and the virtues of Cyril who since his death has been honoured with the title of Saint were displayed in the exercise rather than in the acquisition of his episcopal dignity  He renounced his orthodox ordination officiated as a deacon and was reordained by the hands of the Arians But Cyril afterwards changed with the times and prudently conformed to the Nicene faith Tillemont Mem Eccles tom viii who treats his memory with tenderness and respect has

They  had many temples in each city at Sichem five at Gaza eight at Rome four hundred and twentyfour but the wealth and religion of the Jewish nation was centered in one spot  As the Christians were firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting destruction had been pronounced against the whole fabric of the Mosaic law the Imperial sophist would  have converted the success of his undertaking into a specious argument against the faith of prophecy and the truth of revelation  The secret intentions of Julian are revealed by the late bishop of Gloucester the learned and dogmatic Warburton who with the authority of a theologian prescribes the motives and conduct of the Supreme Being The discourse entitled  Julian  d edition London is strongly marked with all the peculiarities which are imputed to the Warburtonian school  He was displeased with the spiritual worship of the synagogue but he approved the institutions of Moses who had not disdained to adopt many of the rites and ceremonies of Egypt  I shelter myself behind Maimonides Marsham Spencer Le Clerc Warburton c who have fairly derided the fears the folly and the falsehood of some superstitious divines See Divine

Lightfoot the Christian rabbi removes them by a miracle Le Clerc ad loca is bold enough to suspect the fidelity of the numbers  These considerations might influence his designs but the prospect of an immediate and important advantage  would not suffer the impatient monarch to expect the remote and uncertain event of the Persian war He resolved to erect without delay on the commanding eminence of Moriah a stately temple which might eclipse the splendor of the church of the Resurrection on the adjacent hill of Calvary to establish an order of priests whose interested zeal would detect the arts and resist the ambition of their Christian rivals and to invite a numerous colony of Jews whose stern fanaticism would be always prepared to second and even to anticipate the hostile measures of the pagan government Among the friends of the emperor if the names of emperor and of friend are not incompatible the first place was assigned by Julian himself to the virtuous and learned Alypius  Julian epist xxix xxx La Bleterie has neglected to translate the second of these epistles  The humanity of Alypius was tempered by severe justice and manly fortitude and while he exercised his abilities in the civil administration of Britain he imitated in his poetical compositions the harmony and softness of the odes of Sappho This minister to whom Julian communicated without reserve his most careless levities and his most serious counsels received an extraordinary commission to restore in its pristine beauty the temple of Jerusalem and the diligence of Alypius required and obtained the strenuous support of the governor of Palestine At the call of their great deliverer the Jews from all the provinces of the empire assembled on the holy mountain  of their fathers and their insolent triumph alarmed and exasperated the Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem The desire of rebuilding the temple has in every age been the ruling passion of the children of Israel In this propitious moment the men forgot their avarice and the women their delicacy spades and pickaxes of silver were provided by the vanity of the rich and the rubbish was transported in mantles of silk and purple Every purse was opened in liberal contributions every hand claimed a share in the pious labour and the commands of a great monarch were executed by the enthusiasm of a whole people  See the zeal and impatience of the Jews in Gregory Nazianzen Orat iv p and Theodoret l iii c    Yet on this occasion the joint efforts of  The enterprize is defeated  power and enthusiasm were unsuccessful and the ground of the Jewish

emperor and the new maxims of a Christian reign might explain the interruption of an arduous work which was attempted only in the last six months of the life of Julian  Ammianus records the consuls of the year before he proceeds to mention the  thoughts  of Julian Templum instaurare sumptibus  cogitabat  immodicis Warburton has a secret wish to anticipate the design but he must have understood from former examples that the execution of such a work would have demanded many years    But the Christians entertained a natural and pious expectation that in this memorable contest the honour of religion would be vindicated by some signal miracle An earthquake a whirlwind and a fiery eruption which overturned and scattered the new foundations of the temple are attested with some variations by

account of the miracle before the expiration of the same year  perhaps by a praeternatural event  The last of these writers has boldly declared that this praeternatural event was not disputed by the infidels and his assertion strange as it may  seem is confirmed by the unexceptionable testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus  Ammian xxiii Cum itaque rei fortiter instaret Alypius juvaretque provinciae rector metuendi globi flammarum prope fundamenta crebris assultibus erumpentes secere locum exustis aliquoties operantibus inaccessum hocque modo elemento destinatius repellente cessavit inceptum Warburton labours p to extort a confession of the miracle from the mouths of Julian and Libanius and to employ the evidence of a rabbi who lived in the fifteenth century Such witnesses can only be received by a very favourable judge  The philosophic soldier who loved the virtues without adopting the prejudices of his master has recorded in his judicious and candid history of his own times the extraordinary obstacles which interrupted the restoration of the temple of Jerusalem  Whilst Alypius assisted by the governor of the province urged with vigour and diligence the execution of the work horrible balls of fire breaking out near the foundations with frequent and reiterated attacks rendered the place from time to time inaccessible to the scorched and blasted workmen and the victorious element continuing in this manner obstinately and resolutely bent as it were to drive them to a distance the undertaking was abandoned  Such authority should satisfy a believing and must astonish an incredulous mind Yet a philosopher may still require the original evidence of impartial and intelligent spectators At this important crisis any singular accident of nature would assume the appearance and produce the effects of a real prodigy This glorious deliverance would be  speedily improved and magnified by the pious art of the clergy of Jerusalem and the active credulity of the Christian world and at the distance of twenty years a Roman historian careless of theological disputes might adorn his work with the specious and splendid miracle  Dr Lardner perhaps alone of the Christian critics presumes to doubt the truth of this famous miracle Jewish and Heathen Testimonies vol iv p The silence of Jerom would lead to a suspicion that the same story which was celebrated at a distance might be despised on the spot    The restoration of the Jewish temple was secretly  Partiality of Julian  connected with the ruin of the Christian church Julian still continued to maintain the freedom of religious worship without distinguishing whether this universal toleration proceeded from his justice or his clemency He affected to pity the unhappy Christians who were mistaken in the most important object of their lives but his pity was degraded by contempt his contempt was embittered by hatred and the sentiments of Julian were expressed in a style of sarcastic wit which inflicts a deep and deadly wound whenever it issues from the mouth of a sovereign As he was sensible that the Christians gloried in the name of their Redeemer he countenanced and perhaps enjoined the use of the less honourable appellation of GALILAEANS  Greg Naz Orat iii p And this law was confirmed by the invariable practice of Julian himself Warburton has justly observed p that the Platonists believed in the mysterious virtue of words and Julian's dislike for the name of Christ might proceed from superstition as well as from contempt  He declared that by the folly of the Galilaeans  whom he describes as a sect of fanatics contemptible to men and odious to the gods the empire had been reduced to the brink of destruction and he insinuates in a public edict that a frantic patient might sometimes be cured by salutary violence  Fragment Julian p He derides the  Epist vii and so far loses sight of the principles of toleration as to wish epist xlii    An ungenerous distinction was admitted into the mind and counsels of Julian that according to the difference of their religious sentiments one part of his subjects deserved his favour and friendship while the other was entitled only to the common benefits that his justice could not refuse to an obedient people    These two lines which Julian has changed and perverted in the true spirit of a bigot Epist xlix are taken from the speech of Aeolus when he refuses to grant Ulysses a fresh supply of winds Odyss x Libanius Orat Parent c lix p attempts to justify this partial behaviour by an apology in which persecution peeps through the mask of candour  According to a principle pregnant with mischief and oppression the emperor transferred to the pontiffs of his own religion the management of the liberal allowanoes from the public revenue which had been granted to the church by the piety of Constantine and his sons The proud system of clerical honours and immunities which had been constructed with so much art and labour was levelled to the ground the hopes of testamentary donations were intercepted by the rigour of the laws and the priests of the Christian sect were confounded with the last and most  ignominious class of the people Such of these regulations as appeared necessary to check the ambition and avarice of the ecclesiastics were soon afterwards imitated by the wisdom of an orthodox prince The peculiar distinctions which policy has bestowed or superstition has lavished on the sacerdotal order  must  be confined to those priests who profess the religion of the state But the will of the legislator was not exempt from prejudice and passion and it was the object of the insidious policy of Julian to deprive the Christians of all the temporal honours and advantages which rendered them respectable in the eyes of the world  These laws which assected the clergy may be found in the slight hints of Julian himself Epist lii in the vague declamations of Gregory Orat iii p and in the positive assertions of Sozomen l v c    A just and severe censure has been inflicted  He prohibits the Christians from teaching schools  on the law which prohibited the Christians from teaching the arts of grammar and rhetoric  Inclemens perenni obruendum silentio Ammian xxii xxv  The motives alleged by the emperor to justify this partial and oppressive measure might command during his lifetime the silence of slaves and the applause of flatterers Julian abuses the ambiguous meaning of a word which might be indifferently applied to the language and the religion of the GREEKS he contemptuously observes that the men who exalt the merit of implicit faith are unfit to claim or to enjoy the advantages of science and he vainly contends  that if they refuse to adore the gods of Homer and Demosthenes they ought to content themselves with expounding Luke and Matthew in the churches of the Galilaeans  The edict itself which is still extant among the epistles of Julian xlii may be compared with the loose invectives of Gregory Orat iii p Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p has collected the seeming differences of ancients and moderns They may be easily reconciled The Christians were  directly  forbid to teach they were  indirectly  forbid to learn since they would not frequent the schools of the Pagans  In all the cities of the Roman world the education of the youth was entrusted to masters of grammar and rhetoric who were elected by the magistrates maintained at the public expence and distinguished by many lucrative and honourable privileges The edict of Julian appears to have included the physicians and professors of all the liberal arts and the emperor who reserved to himself the approbation of the candidates was authorised by the laws to corrupt or to punish the religious constancy of the most learned of the Christians  Codex Theodos l xiii tit iii de medicis et professoribus leg published the th of June received at Spoleto in Italy the th of July  A D  with Godefroy's Illustrations tom v p  As soon as

Proaeresius a Christian sophist refused to accept the partial favour of the emperor Hieronym in Chron p Edit Scaliger Eunapius in Proaeresio p  teachers had established the unrivalled dominion of the Pagan sophists Julian invited the rising generation to resort with freedom to the public schools in a just confidence  that their tender minds would receive the impressions of literature and idolatry If the greatest part of the Christian youth should be deterred by their own scruples or by those of their parents from accepting this dangerous mode of instruction they must at the same time relinquish the benefits of a liberal education Julian had reason to expect that in the space of a few years the church would relapse into its primaeval simplicity and that the theologians who possessed an adequate share of the learning and eloquence of the age would be succeeded by a generation of blind and ignorant fanatics incapable of defending the truth of their own principles or of exposing the various follies of Polytheism  They had recourse to the expedient of composing books for their own schools Within a few months Apollinaris produced his Christian imitations of Homer a sacred history in xxiv books Pindar Euripides and Menander and Sozomen is satisfied that they equalled or excelled the originals    It was undoubtedly the wish and the design of  Disgrace and oppression of the Christians  Julian to deprive the Christians of the advantages of wealth of knowledge and of power but the injustice of excluding them from all offices of trust and profit seems to have been the result of his general policy rather than the immediate consequence of any positive law  It was the instruction of Julian to his magistrates Epist vii  Sozomen l v c and Socrates l iii c must be reduced to the standard of Gregory Orat iii p not less prone to exaggeration but more restrained by the actual knowledge of his contemporary readers  Superior merit might deserve and obtain some extraordinary  exceptions but the greater part of the Christian officers were gradually removed from their employments in the state the army and the provinces The hopes of future candidates were extinguished by the declared partiality of a prince who maliciously reminded them that it was unlawful for a Christian to use the sword either of justice or of war and who studiously guarded the camp and the tribunals with the ensigns of idolatry The powers of government were entrusted to the Pagans who professed an ardent zeal for the religion of their ancestors and as the choice of the emperor was often directed by the rules of divination the favourites whom he preferred as the most agreeable to the gods did not always obtain the approbation of mankind  Libanius Orat Parent c p  Under the administration of their enemies the Christians had much to suffer and more to apprehend The temper of Julian was averse to cruelty and the care of his reputation which was exposed to the eyes of the universe restrained the philosophic monarch from violating the laws of justice and toleration which he himself had so recently established But the provincial ministers of his authority were placed in a less conspicuous station In the exercise of arbitrary power they consulted the wishes rather than the commands of their sovereign and ventured to exercise a secret and vexatious tyranny against the sectaries on whom they were  not permitted to confer the honours of martyrdom The emperor who dissembled as long as possible his knowledge of the injustice that was exercised in his name expressed his real sense of the conduct of his officers by gentle reproofs and substantial rewards  Greg Naz Orat iii p Socrates l iii c Theodoret l iii c Some drawback may however be allowed for the violence of  their  zeal not less partial than the zeal of Julian    The most effectual instrument of oppression  They are condemned to restore the Pagan temples  with which they were armed was the law that obliged the Christians to make full and ample satisfaction for the temples which they had destroyed under the preceding reign The zeal of the triumphant church had not always expected the sanction of the public authority and the bishops who were secure of impunity had often marched at the head of their congregations to attack and demolish the fortresses of the prince of darkness The consecrated lands which had encreased the patrimony of the sovereign or of the clergy were clearly defined and easily restored But on these lands and on the ruins of Pagan superstition the Christians had frequently erected their own religious edifices and as it was necessary to remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt the justice and piety of the emperor were applauded by one party while the other deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence  If we compare the gentle language of Libanius Orat Parent c p with the passionate exclamations of Gregory Orat iii p we may find it difficult to persuade ourselves that the two orators are really describing the same events  After the ground was cleared the  restitution of those stately structures which had been levelled with the dust and of the precious ornaments which had been converted to Christian uses swelled into a very large account of damages and debt The authors of the injury had neither the ability nor the inclination to discharge this accumulated demand and the impartial wisdom of a legislator would have been displayed in balancing the adverse claims and complaints by an equitable and temperate arbitration But the whole empire and particularly the East was thrown into confusion by the rash edicts of Julian and the Pagan magistrates inflamed by zeal and revenge abused the rigorous privilege of the Roman law which substitutes in the place of his inadequate property the person of the insolvent debtor Under the preceding reign Mark bishop of Arethusa  Restan or Arethusa at the equal distance of sixteen miles between Emesa  Hems  and Epiphania  Hamath  was founded or at feast named by Seleucus Nicator Its peculiar aera dates from the year of Rome according to the medals of the city In the decline of the Seleucides Emesa and Arethusa were usurped by the Arab Sampsiceramus whose posterity the vassals of Rome were not extinguished in the reign of Vespasian See d'Anville's Maps and Geographie Ancienne tom ii p Wesseling Itineraria p and Noris Epoch SyroMacedon p  had laboured in the conversion of his people with arms more effectual than those of persuasion  Sozomen l v c It is surprising that Gregory and Theodoret should suppress a circumstance which in their eyes must have enhanced the religious merit of the confessor  The magistrates required the full value of a temple which had been destroyed by his intolerant zeal but as they were satisfied of his poverty  they desired only to bend his inflexible spirit to the promise of the slightest compensation They apprehended the aged prelate they inhumanly scourged him they tore his beard and his naked body anointed with honey was suspended in a net between heaven and earth and exposed to the stings of insects and the rays of a Syrian Sun  The sufferings and constancy of Mark which Gregory has so tragically painted Orat iii p are confirmed by the unexceptionable and reluctant evidence of Libanius  Epist p Edit Wolf Amstel  From this lofty station Mark still persisted to glory in his crime and to insult the impotent rage of his persecutors He was at length rescued from their hands and dismissed to enjoy the honour of his divine triumph The Arians celebrated the virtue of their pious confessor the catholics ambitiously claimed his alliance  certatim eum sibi Christiani vindicant It is thus that La Croze and Wolfius ad loc have explained a Greek word whose true signification had been mistaken by former interpreters and even by le Clerc Bibliotheque Ancienne et Moderne tom iii p Yet Tillemont is strangely puzzled to understand Mem Eccles tom vii p  how  Gregory and Theodoret could mistake a SemiArian bishop for a saint  and the Pagans who might be susceptible of shame or remorse were deterred from the repetition of such unavailing cruelty  See the probable advice of Sallust Greg Nazianzen Orat iii Libanius intercedes for a similar offender lest they should find many  Marks  yet he allows that if Orion had secreted the consecrated wealth he deserved to suffer the punishment of Marsyas to be flayed alive Epist p  Julian spared his life but if the bishop of Arethusa  had saved the infancy of Julian  Gregory Orat iii p is satisfied that by saving the apostate Mark had deserved still more than he had suffered  posterity will condemn the ingratitude instead of praising the

village of Daphne which emulated the splendor without acquiring the title of a provincial city The temple and the village were deeply bosomed in a thick grove of laurels and cypresses which reached as far as a circumference of ten miles and formed in the most sultry summers a cool and impenetrable shade A thousand streams of the purest water issuing from every hill preserved the verdure of the  earth and the temperature of the air the senses were gratified with harmonious sounds and aromatic odours and the peaceful grove was consecrated to health and joy to luxury and love The vigorous youth pursued like Apollo the object of his desires and the blushing maid was warned by the fate of Daphne to shun the folly of unseasonable coyness The soldier and the philosopher wisely avoided the

virtue But the groves of Daphne continued for many ages to enjoy the veneration of natives and strangers the privileges of the holy ground were enlarged by the munificence of succeeding emperors and

Paganism the church of St Babylas was demolished and new buildings were added to the mouldering edifice which had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings But the first and most serious care of Julian

ground according to the rites which the Athenians formerly practised in the isle of Delos  The scene of infection was purified according to  Removal of the dead bodies and conflagration of the temple  the forms of ancient rituals the bodies were decently removed and the ministers of the church were permitted to convey the remains of St Babylas to their former habitation within the walls of Antioch The modest behaviour which might have assuaged the jealousy of an hostile government was neglected on this occasion by the zeal of the Christians The lofty car that transported the relics of Babylas was followed and accompanied and received by an innumerable multitude who chanted with thundering acclamations the Psalms of David the most expressive of their contempt for idols and idolaters The return of the saint was a triumph and the triumph was an insult on the religion of the emperor who exerted his pride to dissemble his resentment During the night which terminated  this indiscreet procession the temple of Daphne was in flames the statue of Apollo was consumed and the walls of the edifice were left a naked and awful monument of ruin The Christians of Antioch asserted with religious confidence that the powerful intercession of St Babylas had pointed the lightnings of heaven against the devoted roof but as Julian was reduced to the alternative of believing either a crime or a miracle he chose without hesitation without evidence but with some colour of probability to impute the fire of Daphne to the revenge of the Galilaeans  Julian in Misopogon p rather insinuates than affirms their guilt Ammianus xxii treats the imputation as  levissimus rumor  and relates the story with extraordinary candour  Their offence had it been sufficiently proved might have justified the retaliation which was immediately executed by the order of Julian of shutting the doors and confiscating  Julian shuts the cathedral of Antioch  the wealth of the cathedral of Antioch To discover the criminals who were guilty of the tumult of the fire or of secreting the riches of the church several ecclesiastics were tortured  Quo tam atroci casû repente consumpto ad id usque imperatoris ira

circumstances of indignity and profanation and the seasonable death of the principal actor Julian's uncle is related with much superstitious complacency by the Abbé de la Bleterie Vie de Julien p  and a presbyter of the name of Theodoret was beheaded by the sentence of the Count of the East But this hasty act was blamed by  the emperor who lamented with real or affected concern that the imprudent zeal of his ministers would tarnish his reign with the disgrace of persecution  Besides the ecclesiastical historians who are more or less to be suspected we may allege the passion of St Theodore in the Acta Sincera of Ruinart p The complaint of Julian gives it an original and authentic air    The zeal of the ministers of Julian was instantly checked by the frown of their sovereign but when the father of his country declares himself the leader of a faction the licence of popular fury cannot easily be restrained nor consistently punished Julian in a public composition applauds the devotion and loyalty of the holy cities of Syria whose pious inhabitants had destroyed at the first signal the sepulchres of the Galilaeans and faintly complains that they had revenged the injuries of the gods with less moderation than he should have recommended  Julian Misopogon p  This imperfect and reluctant confession may appear to confirm the ecclesiastical narratives that in the cities of Gaza Ascalon Caesarea Heliopolis c the Pagans abused without prudence or remorse the moment of their prosperity That the unhappy objects of their cruelty were released from torture only by death that as their mangled bodies were dragged through the streets they were pierced such was the universal rage by the spits of cooks and the distaffs of enraged women and that the entrails of Christian priests and virgins after they had been tasted by those  bloody fanatics were mixed with barley and contemptuously thrown to the unclean animals of the city  See Gregory Nazianzen Orat iii p Sozomen l v c may be

much credit unless they were confirmed by the testimony of the cool and impartial infidel  from his parents or his education  George of Cappadocia  surnamed the Cappadocian was born at Epiphania in Cilicia in a fuller's shop From this obscure and servile origin he raised himself by the talents of a parasite and the patrons whom he assiduously flattered procured for their worthless dependent a lucrative commission or contract to supply the army with bacon His employment was mean he rendered it infamous He accumulated wealth by the basest arts of fraud and corruption but his malversations were so notorious that George was compelled to escape from the pursuits of justice After this disgrace in which he appears to have saved his  fortune at the expence of his honour he embraced with real or affected zeal the profession of Arianism From the love or the ostentation of learning he collected a valuable library of history rhetoric philosophy and theology  After the massacre of George the emperor Julian repeatedly sent orders to preserve the library for his own use and to torture the slaves who might be suspected of secreting any books He praises the merit of the collection from whence he had borrowed and transcribed several manuscripts while he pursued his studies in Cappadocia He could wish indeed that the works of the Galilaeans might perish but he requires an exact account even of those theological volumes lest other treatises more valuable should be confounded in their loss Julian Epist ix xxxvi  and the choice of the prevailing faction promoted George of Cappadocia to the

arts of an informer The Alexandrians could never forget nor forgive the tax which he suggested on all the houses of  the city under an obsolete claim that the royal founder had conveyed to his successors the Ptolemies and the Caesars the perpetual property of the soil The Pagans who had been flattered with the hopes of freedom and toleration excited his devout avarice and the rich temples of Alexandria were either pillaged or insulted by the haughty prelate who exclaimed in a loud and threatening tone  How long will these sepulchres be permitted to stand  Under the reign of Constantius he was expelled by the fury or rather by the justice of the people and it was not without a violent struggle that the civil and military powers of the state could restore his authority and gratify his

Ammian xxii Epiphanius proves to the Arians that George was not a martyr  The fears of the Pagans were just and their precautions ineffectual The meritorious death of the archbishop obliterated the memory of his life The rival of Athanasius was dear and sacred to the Arians and the seeming conversion of those sectaries introduced his worship into the bosom of the Catholic church  Some Donatists

Act SS Mens April tom iii p His fame and popularity in Europe and especially in England proceeded from the Crusades    About the same time that Julian was informed of the tumult of Alexandria he received intelligence from Edessa that the proud and wealthy faction of the Arians had insulted the weakness of the Valentinians and committed such disorders as ought not to be suffered with impunity in a wellregulated state Without expecting the slow forms of justice the exasperated prince directed his mandate to the magistrates of Edessa  Julian Epist xliii  by which he confiscated the whole property of the church the money was distributed among the soldiers the lands were added to the domain and this act of oppression was aggravated by the most ungenerous irony  I shew myself says Julian the true friend of the Galilaeans Their  admirable  law has promised the kingdom of heaven to the poor and they will advance with more diligence in the paths of virtue and salvation when they are relieved by my assistance from the load of  temporal possessions Take care pursued the monarch in a more serious tone take care how you provoke my patience and humanity If these disorders continue I will revenge on the magistrates the crimes of the people and you will have reason to dread not only confiscation and exile but fire and the sword  The tumults of Alexandria were doubtless of a more bloody and dangerous nature but a Christian bishop had fallen by the hands of the Pagans and the public epistle of Julian affords a very lively proof of the partial spirit of his administration His reproaches to the citizens of Alexandria are mingled with expressions of esteem and tenderness and he laments that on this occasion they should have departed from the gentle and generous manners which attested their Grecian extraction He gravely censures the offence which they had committed against the laws of justice and humanity but he recapitulates with visible complacency the intolerable provocations which they had so long endured from the impious tyranny of George of Cappadocia Julian admits the principle that a wise and vigorous government should chastise the insolence of the people yet in consideration of their founder Alexander and of Serapis their tutelar deity he grants a free and gracious pardon to the guilty city for which he again feels the affection of a brother  Julian Epist x He allowed his friends to assuage his anger Ammian xxii    After the tumult of Alexandria had subsided Athanasius amidst the public acclamations seated himself on the throne from whence his unworthy  Restoration of Athanasius A D Feb  competitor had been precipitated and as the zeal of the archbishop was tempered with discretion the exercise of his authority tended not to inflame but to reconcile the minds of the people His pastoral labours were not confined to the narrow limits of Egypt The state of the Christian world was present to his active and capacious mind and the age the merit the reputation of Athanasius enabled him to assume in a moment of danger the office of Ecclesiastical Dictator  See Athanas ad Rufin tom ii p and Greg Nazlanzen Orat iii p who justly states the temperate zeal of the primate as much more meritorious than his prayers his fasts his persecutions c  Three years were not yet elapsed since the majority of the bishops of the West had ignorantly or reluctantly subscribed the Confession of Rimini They repented they believed but they dreaded the unseasonable rigour of their orthodox brethren and if their pride was stronger than their faith they might throw themselves into the arms of the Arians to escape the indignity of a public penance which must degrade them to the condition of obscure laymen At the same time the domestic differences concerning the union and distinction of the divine persons were agitated with some heat among the Catholic doctors and the progress of this metaphysical controversy seemed to  threaten a public and lasting division of the Greek and Latin churches By the wisdom of a select synod to which the name and presence of Athanasius gave the authority of a general council the bishops who had unwarily deviated into error were admitted to the communion of the church on the easy condition of subscribing the Nicene Creed without any formal acknowledgment of their past fault or any minute definition of their scholastic opinions The advice of the primate of Egypt had already prepared the clergy of Gaul and Spain of Italy and Greece for the reception of this salutary measure and notwithstanding the opposition of some ardent spirits  I have not leisure to follow the blind obstinacy of Lucifer of Cagliari See his adventures in Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p and observe how the colour of the

The skill and diligence of the primate of Egypt had improved the season of tranquillity before  He is persecuted and expelled by Julian A D Oct  it was interrupted by the hostile edicts of the emperor  Tillemont who supposes that George was massacred in August crowds the actions of Athanasius into a narrow space Mem Eccles tom viii p An original fragment published by the marquis Maffei from the old Chapterlibrary of Verona Osservazioni Letterarie tom iii p affords many important dates which are authenticated by the computation of Egyptian months  Julian who despised the Christians  honoured Athanasius with his sincere and peculiar hatred For his sake alone he introduced an arbitrary distinction repugnant at least to the spirit of his former declarations He maintained that the Galilaeans whom he had recalled from exile were not restored by that general indulgence to the possession of their respective churches and he expressed his astonishment that a criminal who had been repeatedly condemned by the judgment of the emperors should dare to insult the majesty of the laws and insolently usurp the archiepiscopal throne of Alexandria without expecting the orders of his sovereign As a punishment for the imaginary offence he again banished Athanasius from the city and he was pleased to suppose that this act of justice would be highly agreeable to his pious subjects The pressing solicitations of the people soon convinced him that the majority of the Alexandrians were Christians and that the greatest part of the Christians were firmly attached to the cause of their oppressed primate But the knowledge of their sentiments instead of persuading him to recall his decree provoked him to extend to all Egypt the term of the exile of Athanasius The zeal of the multitude rendered Julian still more inexorable he was alarmed by the danger of leaving at the head of a tumultuous city a daring and popular leader and the language of his resentment discovers the opinion which he entertained of the courage and abilities of Athanasius The execution of the sentence was still delayed by the caution or  negligence of Ecdicius praefect of Egypt who was at length awakened from his lethargy by a severe reprimand  Though you neglect says Julian to write to me on any other subject at least it is your duty to inform me of your conduct towards Athanasius the enemy of the gods My intentions have been long since communicated to you I swear by the great Serapis that unless on the calends of December Athanasius has departed from Alexandria nay from Egypt the officers of your government shall pay a fine of one hundred pounds of gold You know my temper I am slow to condemn but I am still slower to forgive  This epistle was enforced by a short postscript written with the emperor's own hand  The contempt that is shewn for all the gods fills me with grief and indignation There is nothing that I should see nothing that I should hear with more pleasure than the expulsion of Athanasius from all Egypt The abominable wretch Under my reign the baptism of several Grecian ladies of the highest rank has been the effect of his persecutions  I have preserved the ambiguous sense of the last word the ambiguity of a tyrant who wished to find or to create guilt    The death of Athanasius was not  expressly  commanded but the praefect of Egypt understood that it was safer for him to exceed than to neglect the orders of an irritated master The archbishop prudently retired to the  monasteries of the Desert eluded with his usual dexterity the snares of the enemy and lived to triumph over the ashes of a prince who in words of formidable import had declared his wish that the whole venom of the Galilaean school were contained in the single person of Athanasius  The three Epistles of Julian which explain his intentions and conduct with regard to Athanasius should be disposed in the following chronological order xxvi x vi See likewise Greg Nazianzen xxi p Sozomen l v c Socrates l iii c Theodoret l iii c and Tillemont Mem Eccles tom viii p who has used some materials prepared by the Bollandists    I have endeavoured faithfully to represent the  Zeal and imprudence of the Christians  artful system by which Julian proposed to obtain the effects without incurring the guilt or reproach of persecution But if the deadly spirit of fanaticism perverted the heart and understanding of a virtuous prince it must at the same time be confessed that the  real  sufferings of the Christians were inflamed and magnified by human passions and religious enthusiasm The meekness and resignation which had distinguished the primitive disciples of the gospel was the object of the applause rather than of the imitation of their successors The Christians who had now possessed above forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government of the empire had contracted the insolent vices of prosperity  See the fair confession of Gregory Orat iii p  and the habit of believing that the saints alone were entitled to reign over the earth As soon as the  enmity of Julian deprived the clergy of the privileges which had been conferred by the favour of Constantine they complained of the most cruel oppression and the free toleration of idolaters and heretics was a subject of grief and scandal to the orthodox party  Hear the furious and absurd complaint of Optatus de Schismat Donatist l ii c  The acts of violence which were no longer countenanced by the magistrates were still committed by the zeal of the people At Pessinus the altar of Cybele was overturned almost in the presence of the emperor and in the city of Caesarea in Cappadocia the temple of Fortune the sole place of worship which had been left to the Pagans was destroyed by the rage of a popular tumult On these occasions a prince who felt for the honour of the gods was not disposed to interrupt the course of justice and his mind was still more deeply exasperated when he found that the fanatics who had deserved and suffered the punishment of incendiaries were rewarded with the honours of martyrdom  Greg Nazianzen Orat iii p iv p He praises the rioters of Caesarea  See Sozomen l v Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p owns that their behaviour was not dans l'ordre commun but he is perfectly satisfied as the great St Basil always celebrated the festival of these blessed martyrs  The Christian subjects of Julian were assured of the hostile designs of their sovereign and to their jealous apprehension every circumstance of his government might afford some grounds of discontent  and suspicion In the ordinary administration of the laws the Christians who formed so large a part of the people must frequently be condemned but their indulgent brethren without examining the merits of the cause presumed their innocence allowed their claims and imputed the severity of their judge to the partial malice of religious persecution  Julian determined a lawsuit against the new Christian city at Maiuma the port of Gaza and his sentence though it might be imputed to bigotry was never reversed by his successors Sozomen l v c Reland Palestin tom ii p  These present hardships intolerable as they might appear were represented as a slight prelude of the impending calamities The Christians considered Julian as a cruel and crafty tyrant who suspended the execution of his revenge till he should return victorious from the Persian war They expected that as soon as he had triumphed over the foreign enemies of Rome he would lay aside the irksome mask of dissimulation that the amphitheatres would stream with the blood of hermits and bishops and that the Christians who still persevered in the profession of the faith would be deprived of the common benefits of nature and society  Gregory Orat

boys and girls and positively affirms that the dead bodies were thrown into the Orontes See Theodoret l iii c and the equivocal candour of the Abbé de la Bleterie Vie de Julien p Yet  contemporary  malice could not impute to Julian the troops of martyrs more especially in the West which Baronius so greedily swallows and Tillemont so faintly rejects Mem Eccles tom vii p  that  could wound the reputation of the Apostate was credulously embraced by the fears and hatred of his adversaries and their indiscreet clamours provoked the temper of a sovereign whom it was their duty to respect and their interest to flatter They still protested that prayers and tears were their only weapons against the impious tyrant whose head they devoted to the justice of offended Heaven But they insinuated with sullen resolution that their submission was no longer the effect of weakness and that in the imperfect state of human virtue the patience which is founded on principle may be exhausted by persecution It is impossible to determine how far the zeal of Julian would have prevailed over his good sense and humanity but if we seriously reflect on the strength and spirit of the church we shall be convinced that before the emperor could have extinguished the religion of Christ he must have involved his country in the horrors of a civil war  The resignation of Gregory is truly edifying Orat

Julian are of such an original cast that the critic is perplexed to which class he should ascribe them  During the freedom and equality of the days of the Saturnalia Romulus prepared a feast for the deities of Olympus who had adopted him as a worthy associate and for the Roman princes who had reigned over his martial people and the vanquished nations of the earth The immortals were placed in just order on their thrones of state and the table of the Caesars was spread below the Moon  in the upper region of the air The tyrants who would have disgraced the society of gods and men were thrown headlong by the inexorable Nemesis into the Tartarean abyss The rest of the Caesars successively advanced to their seats and as they passed the vices the defects the blemishes of their respective characters were maliciously noticed by old Silenus a laughing moralist who disguised the wisdom of a philosopher under the mask of a Bacchanal  This mixed character of Silenus is finely painted in the sixth eclogue of Virgil  As soon as the feast was ended the voice of Mercury proclaimed the will of Jupiter that a celestial crown should be the reward of superior merit Julius Caesar Augustus Trajan and Marcus Antoninus were selected as the most illustrious candidates the effeminate Constantine  Every impartial reader must perceive and condemn the partiality of Julian against his uncle

from this honourable competition and the great Alexander was invited to dispute the prize of glory with the Roman heroes Each of the candidates was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits but in the judgment of the gods the modest silence of Marcus pleaded more powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals When the judges of this awful contest proceeded to examine the heart and to scrutinize the springs of action the superiority of the Imperial Stoic appeared still  more decisive and conspicuous  Julian was secretly inclined to prefer a Greek to a Roman But when he seriously compared a hero with a philosopher he was sensible that mankind had much greater obligations to Socrates than to Alexander Orat ad Themistium p  Alexander and Caesar Augustus Trajan and Constantine acknowledged with a blush that fame or power or pleasure had been the important object of  their  labours but the gods themselves beheld with reverence and love a virtuous mortal who had practised on the throne the lessons of philosophy and who in a state of human imperfection had aspired to imitate the moral attributes of the Deity The value of this agreeable composition the Caesars

In the cool moments of reflection Julian preferred  He resolves to march against the Persians A D  the useful and benevolent virtues of Antoninus but his ambitious spirit was inflamed by the glory of Alexander and he solicited with equal ardour the esteem of the wise and the applause of the multitude In the season of life when the powers of the mind and body enjoy the most active vigour the emperor who was instructed by the experience and animated by the success of the German war resolved to signalize his reign by some more splendid and memorable atchievement The ambassadors of  the East

Taprobana Serendib and Ceylon have been successively applied manifests how imperfectly the seas and lands to the east of cape Comorin were known to the Romans Under the reign of Claudius a freedman who farmed the customs of the Red Sea was accidentally driven by the winds upon this strange and undiscovered coast he conversed six months with the natives and the king of Ceylon who heard for the first time of the power and justice of Rome was persuaded to send an embassy to the emperor Plin Hist Nat vi The geographers and even Ptolemy have magnified above fifteen times the real size of this new world which they extended as far as the equator and the neighbourhood of China  had respectfully saluted the Roman purple  These embassies had been sent to Constantius Ammianus who unwarily deviates into gross flattery must have forgotten the length of the way and the short duration of the reign of Julian  The nations of the West esteemed and dreaded the personal virtues of Julian both in peace and war He despised the trophies of a Gothic victory  Gothos saepe fallaces et perfidos hostes quaerere se meliores aiebat illis enim sufficere mercatores Galatas per quos ubique sine conditionis discrimine venumdantur Within less than fifteen years these Gothic slaves threatened and subdued their masters  and was satisfied that the rapacious Barbarians of the Danube would be restrained from any future violation of the faith of treaties by the terror of his name and the additional fortifications with which he strengthened the Thracian and Illyrian frontiers The successor of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the only rival whom he deemed worthy of his arms and he resolved by the final conquest of Persia to chastise the haughty nation which had so long  resisted and insulted the majesty of Rome  Alexander reminds his rival Caesar who depreciated the fame and merit of an Asiatic victory that Crassus and Antony had felt the Persian arrows and that the Romans in a war of three hundred years had not yet subdued the single province of Mesopotamia or Assyria Caesares p  As soon as the Persian monarch was informed that the throne of Constantius was filled by a prince of a very different character he condescended to make some artful or perhaps sincere overtures towards a negociation of peace But the pride of Sapor was astonished by the firmness of Julian who sternly declared that he would never consent to hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of Mesopotamia and who added with a smile of contempt that it was needless to treat by ambassadors as he himself had determined to visit speedily the court of Persia The impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations The generals were named a formidable army was destined for this important service and Julian marching from Constantinople through the provinces of Asia Minor arrived at Antioch about eight months after the death of his predecessor His ardent desire to march into the heart of Persia was checked by the indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire by his zeal to revive the worship of the gods and by the advice of his wisest friends who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary interval of winterquarters to restore the exhausted strength  of the legions of Gaul and the discipline and spirit of the Eastern troops Julian was persuaded to fix till the ensuing spring his residence  Julian proceeds from Constantinople to Antioch August  at Antioch among a people maliciously disposed to deride the haste and to censure the delays of their sovereign  The design of the Persian war is declared by Ammianus xxii Libanius Orat Parent c p Zosimus l iii p and Socrates l iii c    If Julian had flattered himself that his personal connection with the capital of the East  Licentious manners of the people of Antioch  would be productive of mutual satisfaction to the prince and people he made a very false estimate of his own character and of the manners of Antioch  The Satire of Julian and the Homilies of St Chrysostom exhibit the same picture of Antioch The miniature which the Abbé de la Bleterie has copied from thence Vie de Julien p is elegant and correct  The warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and opulence and the lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended with the hereditary softness of the Syrians Fashion was the only law pleasure the only pursuit and the splendour of dress and furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch The arts of luxury were honoured the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule and the contempt for female modesty and reverent age announced the universal corruption of the capital of the East The love of spectacles was the taste or rather passion of the Syrians the most skilful artists were procured  from the adjacent cities  Laodicea furnished charioteers Tyre and Berytus comedians Caesarea pantomimes Hellopolis singers Gaza gladiators Ascalon wrestlers and Castabala ropedancers See the Expositio totius Mundi p in the third tome of Hudson's Minor Geographers  a considerable share of the revenue was devoted to the public amusements and the magnificence of the games of the theatre and circus was considered as the happiness and as the glory of Antioch The rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory and was insensible of such happiness soon disgusted the delicacy of his subjects and the effeminate Orientals could neither imitate nor admire the severe simplicity which Julian always maintained and sometimes affected The days of festivity consecrated by ancient custom to the honour of the gods were the only occasions in which Julian relaxed his philosophic severity and those festivals were the only days in which the Syrians of Antioch could reject the allurements of pleasure The majority of the people supported the glory of the Christian name which had been first invented by their ancestors  The people of Antioch ingeniously professed their attachment to the  Chi  Christ and the  Kappa  Constantius Julian in Misopogon p  they contented themselves with disobeying the moral precepts but they were scrupulously attached to the speculative doctrines of their religion The church of Antioch was distracted by heresy and schism but the Arians and the Athanasians the  followers of Meletius and those of Paulinus  The schism of Antioch which lasted eightyfive years A D was inflamed while Julian resided in that city by the indiscreet ordination of Paulinus See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p of the quarto edition Paris c which henceforward I shall quote  were actuated by the same pious hatred of their common adversary  The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of an apostate the enemy and successor  Their aversion to Julian  of a prince who had engaged the affections of a very numerous sect and the removal of St Babylas excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian His subjects complained with superstitious indignation that famine had pursued the emperor's steps from Constantinople to Antioch and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by the injudicious attempt to relieve their distress The inclemency  Scarcity of corn and public discontent  of the season had affected the harvests of Syria and the price of bread  Julian states three different proportions of five ten or fifteen  modii  of wheat for one piece of gold according to the degrees of plenty and scarcity in Misopogon p From this fact and from some collateral examples I conclude that under the successors of Constantine the moderate price of wheat was about thirtytwo shillings the English quarter which is equal to the average price of the sixtyfour first years of the present century See Arbuthnot's Tables of Coins Weights and Measures p Plin Hist Natur xviii Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xxviii p Smith's Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations vol i p This last I am proud to quote as the work of a sage and a friend  in the markets of Antioch had naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn But the fair and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious  arts of monopoly In this unequal contest in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party as his exclusive property is used by another as a lucrative object of trade and is required by a third for the daily and necessary support of life all the profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the head of the defenceless consumers The hardships of their situation were exaggerated and encreased by their own impatience and anxiety and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the appearances of a famine When the luxurious citizens of Antioch complained of the high price of poultry and fish Julian publicly declared that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine oil and bread but he acknowledged that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his people With this salutary view the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and doubtful step of fixing by legal authority the value of corn He enacted that in a time of scarcity it should be sold at a price which had seldom been known in the most plentiful years and that his own example might strengthen his laws he sent into the market four hundred and twentytwo thousand  modii  or measures which were drawn by his order from the granaries of Hierapolis of Chalcis and even of Egypt The consequences might have been foreseen and were soon felt The Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants the proprietors of land or of corn withheld from  the city the accustomed supply and the small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal price Julian still continued to applaud his own policy treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur and convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy though not the cruelty of his brother Gallus  Nunquam a proposito declinabat Galli similis fratris licet incruentus Ammian xxii The ignorance of the most enlightened princes may claim some excuse but we cannot be satisfied with Julian's own defence in Misopogon p or the elaborate apology of Libanius Orat Parental c xcvii p  The remonstrances of the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind He was persuaded perhaps with truth that the senators of Antioch who possessed lands or were concerned in trade had themselves contributed to the calamities of their country and he imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed to the sense not of public duty but of private interest The whole body consisting of two hundred of the most noble and wealthy citizens were sent under a guard from the palace to the prison and though they were permitted before the close of evening to return to their respective houses  Their short and easy confinement is gently touched by Libanius Orat Parental c xcviii p  the emperor himself could not obtain the forgiveness which he had so easily granted The same grievances were still the subject of the same complaints which were industriously circulated by the wit and levity of the Syrian Greeks  During the licentious days of the Saturnalia the streets of the city resounded with insolent songs which derided the laws the religion the personal conduct and even the  beard  of the emperor and the spirit of Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates and the applause of the multitude  Libanius ad Antiochenos de Imperatoris ira c in Fabricius Bibliot Graec tom vii p like a skilful advocate severely censures the folly of the people who suffered for the crime of a few obscure and drunken wretches  The disciple of Socrates was too deeply affected by these popular insults but the monarch endowed with quick sensibility and possessed of absolute power refused his passions the gratification of revenge A tyrant might have proscribed without distinction the lives and fortunes of the citizens of Antioch and the unwarlike Syrians must have patiently submitted to the lust the rapaciousness and the cruelty of the faithful legions of Gaul A milder sentence might have deprived the capital of the East of its honours and privileges and the courtiers perhaps the subjects of Julian would have applauded an act of justice which asserted the dignity of the supreme magistrate of the republic  Libanius ad Antiochen c vii p reminds Antioch of the recent chastisement of Caesarea and even Julian in Misopogon p insinuates how severely Tarentum had expiated the insult to the Roman ambassadors  But instead of abusing or exerting the authority of the state to revenge his personal injuries Julian contented himself with  Julian composes a satire against Antioch  an inoffensive mode of retaliation which it would  be in the power of few princes to employ He had been insulted by satires and libels in his turn he composed under the title of the  Enemy of the Beard  an ironical confession of his own faults and a severe satire of the licentious and effeminate manners of Antioch This Imperial reply was publicly exposed before the gates of the palace and the MISOPOGON  On the subject of the Misopogon see Ammianus xxii Libanius Orat

the nomination of a governor  Ipse autem Antiochiam egressurus Heliopoliten quendam Alexandrum Syriacae jurisdictioni praefecit turbulentum et saevum dicebatque non illum meruisse sed Antiochensibus

harsh reformer of the manners and religion of Antioch  worthy only of such subjects and the emperor for ever renouncing the ungrateful city proclaimed his resolution to pass the ensuing winter at Tarsus in Cilicia  Julian in Misopogon p Ammian xxiii and Valesius ad loc Libanius in a professed oration invites him to return to his loyal and penitent city of Antioch    Yet Antioch possessed one citizen whose genius and virtues might atone in the opinion of Julian for the vice and solly of his country  The sophist Libanius  The sophist Libanius was born in the capital of the East he publicly professed the arts of  A D c  rhetoric and declamation at Nice Nicomedia Constantinople Athens and during the remainder of his life at Antioch His school was assiduously frequented by the Grecian youth his disciples who sometimes exceeded the number of eighty celebrated their incomparable master and the jealousy of his rivals who persecuted him from one city to another confirmed the favourable opinion which Libanius ostentatiously displayed of his superior merit The praeceptors of Julian had extorted a rash but solemn assurance that he would never attend the lectures of their adversary the curiosity of the royal youth was checked and inflamed he secretly procured the writings of this dangerous sophist and gradually surpassed in the perfect imitation of his style the most laborious of his domestic pupils  Libanius Orat Parent c vii p  When Julian ascended the throne he declared his impatience to embrace and reward the Syrian sophist who had preserved in a degenerate age the Grecian purity of taste of manners and of religion The emperor's prepossession was encreased and justified by the discreet pride of his favourite Instead of pressing with the foremost of the crowd into  the palace of Constantinople Libanius calmly expected his arrival at Antioch withdrew from court on the first symptoms of coldness and indifference required a formal invitation for each visit and taught his sovereign an important lesson that he might command the obedience of a subject but that he must deserve the attachment of a friend The sophists of every age despising or affecting to despise the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune  Eunapius reports that Libanius refused the honorary rank of Praetorian praefect as less illustrious than the title of Sophist in Vit Sophist p The critics have observed a similar sentiment in one of the epistles xviii edit Wolf of Libanius himself  reserve their esteem for the superior qualities of the mind with which they themselves are so plentifully endowed Julian might disdain the acclamations of a venal court who adored the Imperial purple but he was deeply flattered by the praise the admonition the freedom and the envy of an independent philosopher who refused his favours loved his person celebrated his fame and protected his memory The voluminous writings of Libanius still exist for the most part they are the vain and idle compositions of an orator who cultivated the science of words the productions of a recluse student whose mind regardless of his contemporaries was incessantly fixed on the Trojan war and the Athenian commonwealth Yet the sophist of Antioch sometimes descended from this imaginary elevation he entertained a various and elaborate  correspondence  Near two thousand of his letters a mode of composition in which Libanius was thought to excel are still extant and already published The critics may praise their subtle and elegant brevity yet Dr Bentley Dissertation upon Phalaris p might justly though quaintly observe that  you feel by the emptiness and deadness of them that you converse with some dreaming pedant with his elbow on his desk  he praised the virtues of his own times he boldly arraigned the abuses of public and private life and he eloquently pleaded the cause of Antioch against the just resentment of Julian and Theodosius It is the common calamity of old age  His birth is assigned to the year He mentions the seventysixth year of his age A D and seems to allude to some events of a still later date  to lose whatever might have rendered it desirable but Libanius experienced the peculiar misfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences to which he had consecrated his genius The friend of Julian was an indignant spectator of the triumph of Christianity and his bigotry which darkened the prospect of the visible world did not inspire Libanius with any lively hopes of celestial glory and happiness  Libanius has composed the vain prolix but curious

respect the eloquent sermon of the apostle of paganism The son of one of the most illustrious citizens of Beraea who had embraced either from interest or conscience the religion of the emperor was disinherited by his angry parent The father and the son were invited to the Imperial table Julian placing himself between them attempted without success to inculcate the lesson and example of toleration supported with affected calmness the indiscreet zeal of the aged Christian who seemed to forget the sentiments of nature and the duty of a subject and at length turning towards the afflicted youth  Since you have lost a father said he for my sake it is incumbent on me to supply his place  Julian alludes to this incident epist xxvii which is more distinctly related by Theodoret l

his wishes at Batnae a small town pleasantly seated  in a grove of cypresses about twenty miles from the city of Hierapolis The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently prepared by the inhabitants of Batnae who seemed attached to the worship of their tutelar deities Apollo and Jupiter but the serious piety of Julian was offended by the tumult of their applause and he too clearly discerned that the smoke which arose from their altars was the incense of flattery rather than of devotion The ancient and magnificent temple which had sanctified for so many ages the city of Hierapolis  See the curious treatise de Deâ Syriâ inserted among the works of Lucian tom iii p edit Reitz The singular appellation of  Ninus vetus  Ammian xiv might induce a suspicion that Hierapolis had been the royal seat of the Assyrians  no longer subsisted and the consecrated wealth which afforded a liberal maintenance to more than three hundred priests might hasten its downfall Yet Julian enjoyed the satisfaction of embracing a philosopher and a friend whose religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations of Constantius and Gallus as often as those princes lodged at his house in their passage through Hierapolis In the hurry of military preparation and the careless confidence of a familiar correspondence the zeal of Julian appears to have been lively and uniform He had now undertaken an important and difficult war and the anxiety of the event rendered him still more attentive to observe and register the most trifling presages from which according to the rules of divination any knowledge of futurity could be  derived  Julian epist xxviii kept a regular account of all the fortunate omens but he suppresses the inauspicious signs which Ammianus xxiii has

important season of the year in the circus of Samosata or in the churches of Edessa But as the warlike emperor instead of Constantius had chosen Alexander for his model he advanced without delay to Carrhae  Haran or Carrhae was the ancient residence of the Sabaeans and of Abraham See the Index Geographicus of Schultens ad+calcem Vit Saladin a work from which I have obtained much  Oriental  knowledge concerning the ancient and modern geography of Syria and the adjacent countries  a very ancient city of Mesopotamia at the distance of fourscore miles from Hierapolis The temple of the Moon attracted the devotion of Julian but the halt of a few days was principally employed in completing  the immense preparations of the Persian war The secret of the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast but as Carrhae is the point of separation of the two great roads he could no longer conceal whether it was his design to attack the dominions of Sapor on the side of the Tigris or on that of the Euphrates The emperor detached an army of thirty thousand men under the command of his kinsman Procopius and of Sebastian who had been duke of Egypt They were ordered to direct their march towards Nisibis and to secure the frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy before they attempted the passage of the Tigris Their subsequent operations were left to the discretion of the generals but Julian expected that after wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media and Adiabene they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon about the same time that he himself advancing with equal steps along the banks of the Euphrates should besiege the capital of the Persian monarchy The success of this wellconcerted plan depended in  Disaffection of the king of Armenia  a great measure on the powerful and ready assistance of the king of Armenia who without exposing the safety of his own dominions might detach an army of four thousand horse and twenty thousand foot to the assistance of the Romans  See Xenophon Cyropoed l iii p edit Hutchinson Artavasdes might have supplied Marc Antony with horse armed and disciplined after the Parthian manner Plutarch in M Antonio

decent excuses of religion and gratitude He expressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius from whose hands he had received in marriage Olympias the daughter of the praefect Ablavius and

gave his brother's widow  an expression more suitable to a Roman than a Christian  Tiranus professed the Christian religion he reigned over a nation of Christians and he was restrained by every principle of conscience and interest from contributing to the victory which would consummate the ruin of the church The alienated mind of Tiranus was exasperated by the indiscretion of Julian who

The legions appeared to direct their march towards Nisibis and the Tigris On a sudden they wheeled to the right traversed the level and naked plain of Carrhae and reached on the third day the banks of the Euphrates where the strong town of Nicephorium or Callinicum had been founded by the Macedonian kings From thence the emperor pursued his march above ninety miles along the winding stream of the Euphrates till at length about one month after his departure from Antioch he discovered the towers of Circesium the extreme limit of the Roman dominions The army of Julian the most numerous that any of the Caesars had ever led against Persia consisted of sixtyfive thousand effective and welldisciplined soldiers The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry of Romans and Barbarians had been selected from the different provinces and a just preeminence of loyalty and valour was claimed by the hardy Gauls who guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince A formidable body of Scythian auxiliaries had been transported from another climate and almost from another world to invade a distant country of whose name and situation they were  ignorant The love of rapine and war allured to the Imperial standard several tribes of Saracens or roving Arabs whose service Julian had commanded while he sternly refused the payment of the accustomed subsidies The broad channel of the Euphrates

was composed of fifty armed gallies and these were accompanied by an equal number of flatbottomed boats which might occasionally be connected into the form of temporary bridges The rest of the ships partly constructed of timber and partly covered with raw hides were laden with an almost inexhaustible supply of arms and engines of utensils and provisions The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers but he prohibited the indulgence of wine and rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous camels that attempted to

impatient and attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and glorious triumphs of their ancestors He excited their resentment by a lively picture of the insolence of the Persians and he exhorted them to imitate his firm resolution either to extirpate that perfidious nation or to devote his life in the cause of the republic The eloquence of Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty pieces of silver to every soldier and the bridge of the Chaboras was instantly cut away to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of safety in the success of their arms Yet the prudence of the emperor induced him to secure a remote frontier perpetually exposed to the inroads of the hostile Arabs A detachment of four thousand men was left at Circesium which completed to the number of ten thousand the regular garrison of that important fortress  The enterprize and armament of Julian are described by himself Epist xxvii Ammianus Marcellinus xxiii Libanius

masters his valour and fidelity raised him to the military honours of the Roman service and though a Christian he might indulge the secret satisfaction of convincing his ungrateful country that an oppressed subject may prove the most dangerous enemy Such was the disposition of the three principal columns The front and  flanks of the army were covered by Lucillianus with a flying detachment of fifteen hundred lightarmed soldiers whose active vigilance observed the most distant signs and conveyed the earliest notice of any hostile approach Dagalaiphus and Secundinus duke of Osrhoene conducted the troops of the rearguard the baggage securely proceeded in the intervals of the columns and the ranks from a motive either of use or ostentation were formed in such open order that the whole line of march extended almost ten miles The ordinary post of Julian was at the head of the centre column but as he preferred the duties of a general to the state of a monarch he rapidly moved with a small escort of light cavalry to the front the rear the flanks wherever his presence could animate or protect the march of the Roman army The country which they traversed from the Chaboras to the cultivated lands of Assyria may be considered as a part of the desert of Arabia a dry and barren waste which could never be improved by the most powerful arts of human industry Julian marched over the same ground which had been trod above seven hundred years before by the footsteps of the younger Cyrus and which is described by one of the companions of his expedition the sage and heroic Xenophon  See the first book of the Anabasis p This pleasing work is original and authentic Yet Xenophon's memory perhaps many years after the expedition has sometimes betrayed him and the distances which he marks are often larger than either a soldier or a geographer will allow    The country was a plain  throughout as even as the sea and full of wormwood and if any other kind of shrubs or reeds grew there they had all an aromatic smell but no trees could be seen Bustards and ostriches antelopes and wild asses  Mr Spelman the English translator of the Anabasis vol i p confounds the antelope

desert was frequently raised by the wind into clouds of dust and a great number of the soldiers of Julian with their tents were suddenly thrown to the ground by the violence of an unexpected hurricane

honourable exception  the actual residence of an Arabian Emir is composed of two long streets which inclose within a natural fortification a small island in the midst and two fruitful spots on either side of the Euphrates The warlike inhabitants of Anatho shewed a disposition to  stop the march of a Roman emperor till they were diverted from such fatal presumption by the mild exhortations of prince Hormisdas and the approaching terrors of the fleet and army They implored and experienced the clemency of Julian who transplanted the people to an advantageous settlement near Chalcis in Syria and admitted Pusaeus the governor to an honourable rank in his service and friendship But the impregnable fortress of Thilutha could scorn the menace of a siege and the emperor was obliged to content himself with an insulting promise that when he had subdued the interior provinces of Persia Thilutha would no longer refuse to grace the triumph of the conqueror The inhabitants of the open towns unable to resist and unwilling to yield fled with precipitation and their houses filled with spoil and provisions were occupied by the soldiers of Julian who massacred without remorse and without punishment some defenceless women During the march the Surenas or Persian general and Malek Rodosaces the renowned Emir of the tribe of Gassan  Famosi nominis latro says Ammianus an high encomium for

rivers unite at Apamea or Corna one hundred miles from the Persian Gulf into the broad stream of the Pasitigris or ShatulArab The Euphrates formerly reached the sea by a separate channel which was obstructed and diverted by the citizens of Orchoe about twenty miles to the southeast of modern Basra d'Anville in the Memoires de l'Acad des Inscriptions tom xxx p  The whole country  might have claimed the peculiar name of Mesopotamia as the two rivers which are never more distant than fifty approach between Bagdad and Babylon within twentyfive miles of each other A multitude of artificial canals dug without much labour in a soft and yielding soil connected the rivers and intersected the plain of Assyria The uses of these artificial canals were various and important They served to discharge the superfluous waters from one river into the other at the season of their respective inundations Subdividing themselves into smaller and smaller branches they refreshed the dry lands and supplied the deficiency of rain They facilitated the intercourse of peace and commerce and as the dams could be speedily broke down they armed the despair of the Assyrians with the means of opposing a sudden deluge to the progress of an invading army To the soil and climate of Assyria nature had denied some of her choicest gifts the vine the olive and the figtree but the food which supports the life of man and particularly wheat and barley were produced with inexhaustible fertility and the husbandman who committed his seed to the earth was frequently rewarded with an encrease of two or even of three hundred The face of the country was interspersed with groves of innumerable palmtrees  The learned Kaempfer as a botanist an antiquary and a traveller has exhausted Amoenitat Exotieae Fascicul iv p the whole subject of palmtrees  and the diligent natives celebrated either in verse or prose the  three hundred and sixty uses to which the trunk the branches the leaves the juice and the fruit were skilfully applied Several manufactures especially those of leather and linen employed the industry of a numerous people and afforded valuable materials for foreign trade which appears however to have been conducted by the hands of strangers Babylon had been converted into a royal park but near the ruins of the ancient capital new cities had successively arisen and the populousness of the country was displayed in the multitude of towns and villages which were built of bricks dried in the sun and strongly cemented with bitumen the natural and peculiar production of the Babylonian soil While the successors of Cyrus reigned over Asia the province of Assyria alone maintained during a third part of the year the luxurious plenty of the table and household of the Great King Four considerable villages were assigned for the subsistence of his Indian dogs eight hundred stallions and sixteen thousand mares were constantly kept at the expence of the country for the royal stables and as the daily tribute which was paid to the satrap amounted to one English bushel of silver we may compute the annual revenue of Assyria at more than twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling  Assyria yielded to the Persian satrap an  Artaba  of silver each day The wellknown proportion of weights and measures see Bishop Hooper's elaborate Inquiry the specific gravity of water and silver and the value of that metal will afford after a short process the annual revenue which I have stated Yet the Great King received no more than Euboic or Tyrian talents l from Assyria The comparison of two passages in Herodotus l i c l iii c reveals an important difference between the  gross  and the  net  revenue of Persia the sums paid by the province and the gold or silver deposited in the royal treasure The monarch might annually save three millions six hundred thousand pounds of the seventeen or eighteen millions raised upon the people    The fields of Assyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of war and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the acts of rapine  Invasion of Assyria A D May  and cruelty which had been committed by their haughty master in the Roman provinces The trembling Assyrians summoned the rivers to their assistance and completed with their own hands the ruin of their country The roads were rendered impracticable a flood of waters was poured into the camp and during several days the troops of Julian were obliged to contend with the most discouraging hardships But every obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries who were inured to toil as well as to danger and who felt themselves animated by the spirit of their leader The damage was gradually repaired the waters were restored to their proper channels whole groves of palmtrees were cut down and placed along the broken parts of the road and the army passed over the broad and deeper canals on bridges of floating rafts which were supported by the help of bladders Two cities of Assyria presumed to resist the arms of a Roman emperor and they both paid the severe penalty of their rashness At the distance of fifty miles from the royal residence  Siege of Perisabor  of Ctesiphon Perisabor or Anbar held  the second rank in the province a city large populous and well fortified surrounded with a double wall almost encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates and defended by the valour of a numerous garrison The exhortations of Hormisdas were repulsed with contempt and the ears of the Persian prince were wounded by a just reproach that unmindful of his royal birth he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful as well as vigorous defence till the lucky stroke of a batteringram having opened a large breach by shattering one of the angles of the wall they hastily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel The soldiers of Julian rushed impetuously into the town and after the full gratification of every military appetite Perisabor was reduced to ashes and the engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses The contest was continued by an incessant and mutual discharge of missile weapons and the superiority which the Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and catapultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the side of the besieged But as soon as an  Helepolis  had been constructed which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts the tremendous aspect of a moving turret that would leave no hope of resistance or of mercy terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble submission and the place was surrendered only two days after Julian first appeared  under the walls of Perisabor Two thousand five hundred persons of both sexes the feeble remnant of a flourishing people were permitted to retire the plentiful magazines of corn of arms and of splendid furniture were partly distributed among the troops and partly reserved for the public service the useless stores were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the Euphrates and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin of Perisabor  The city or rather fortress of Maogamalcha  of Maogamalcha  which was defended by sixteen large towers a deep ditch and two strong and solid walls of brick and bitumen appears to have been constructed at the distance of eleven miles as the safeguard of the capital of Persia The emperor apprehensive of leaving such an important fortress in his rear immediately formed the siege of Maogamalcha and the Roman army was distributed for that purpose into three divisions Victor at the head of the cavalry and of a detachment of heavyarmed foot was ordered to clear the country as far as the banks of the Tigris and the suburbs of Ctesiphon The conduct of the attack was assumed by Julian himself who seemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which he erected against the walls while he secretly contrived a more efficacious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city Under the direction of Nevitta and

troops a mine was carried under the foundations of the walls and sustained at sufficient intervals by props of timber Three chosen cohorts advancing in a single file silently explored the dark and dangerous passage till their intrepid leader whispered back the intelligence that he was ready to issue from his confinement into the streets of the hostile city Julian checked their ardour that he might ensure their success and immediately diverted the attention of the garrison by the tumult and clamour of a general assault The Persians who from their walls contemptuously beheld the progress of an impotent attack celebrated with songs of triumph the glory of Sapor and ventured to assure the emperor that he might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd before he could hope to take the impregnable city of Maogamalcha The city was already taken History has recorded the name of a private soldier the first who ascended from the mine into a deserted tower The passage was widened by his companions who pressed forwards with impatient valour Fifteen hundred enemies were already in the midst of the city The astonished garrison abandoned the walls and their only hope of safety the gates were instantly burst open and the revenge of the soldier unless it were suspended by lust or avarice was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre The governor who had yielded on a promise of mercy was burnt  alive a few days afterwards on a charge of having uttered some disrespectful words against the honour of Prince Hormisdas The fortifications were razed to the ground and not a vestige was left that the city of Maogamalcha had ever existed The neighbourhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three stately palaces laboriously enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch The pleasant situation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris was improved according to the Persian taste by the symmetry of flowers fountains and shady walks and spacious parks were inclosed for the reception of the bears lions and wild boars which were maintained at a considerable expence for the pleasure of the royal chace The parkwalls were broke down the savage game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers and the palaces of Sapor were reduced to ashes by the command of the Roman emperor Julian on this occasion shewed himself ignorant or careless of the laws of civility which the prudence and refinement of polished ages have established between hostile princes Yet these wanton ravages need not excite in our breasts any vehement emotions of pity or resentment A simple naked statue finished by the hand of a Grecian artist is of more genuine value than all these rude and costly monuments of Barbaric labour and if we are more deeply affected by the ruin of a palace than by the conflagration of a cottage our humanity must have  formed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries of human life  The operations of the Assyrian war are

more conspicuously displayed than in the last and most active period of his life He practised without effort and almost without merit the habitual qualities of temperance and sobriety According to the dictates of that artificial wisdom which assumes an absolute dominion over the mind and body he sternly refused himself the indulgence of the most natural appetites  The famous examples of Cyrus Alexander and Scipio were acts of justice Julian's chastity was voluntary and in his opinion meritorious  In the warm climate of Assyria which solicited a luxurious people to the gratification of every sensual desire  Sallust ap Vet Scholiast Juvenal Satir i observes that nihil corruptius moribus The matrons and virgins of Babylon freely mingled with the men in licentious banquets and as they

resisted the allurements of love he sustained the hardships of war When the Romans marched through the flat and flooded country their sovereign on foot at the head of his legions shared their fatigues and animated their diligence In every useful labour the hand of Julian was prompt and strenuous and the Imperial purple was wet and dirty as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier The two sieges allowed him some remarkable opportunities of signalising his personal valour which in the improved state of the military art can seldom be exerted by a prudent general The emperor stood before the citadel of Perisabor insensible of his extreme danger and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates of iron till he was almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile weapons and huge stones that were directed against his person As he examined the exterior fortifications of Maogamalcha two Persians devoting themselves for their country suddenly rushed upon him with drawn scimitars the emperor dexterously received their blows on his uplifted shield and  with a steady and wellaimed thrust laid one of his adversaries dead at his feet The esteem of a prince who possesses the virtues which he approves is the noblest recompence of a deserving subject and the authority which Julian derived from his personal merit enabled him to revive and enforce the rigour of ancient discipline He punished with death or ignominy the misbehaviour of three troops of horse who in a skirmish with the Surenas had lost their honour and one of their standards and he distinguished with  obsidional

grave and manly language of a Roman  Riches are the object of your desires those riches are in the hands of the Persians and the spoils of this fruitful country are proposed as the prize of your valour and discipline Believe me added Julian the Roman republic which formerly possessed such immense treasures is now reduced to want and wretchedness since our princes have been persuaded by weak and interested ministers to purchase with gold the  tranquillity of the Barbarians The revenue is exhausted the cities are ruined the provinces are dispeopled For myself the only inheritance that I have received from my royal ancestors is a soul incapable of fear and as long as I am convinced that every real advantage is seated in the mind I shall not blush to acknowledge an honourable poverty which in the days of ancient virtue was considered as the glory of Fabricius That glory and that virtue may be your own if you listen to the voice of Heaven and of your leader But if you will rashly persist if you are determined to renew the shameful and mischievous examples of old seditions proceedAs it becomes an emperor who has filled the first rank among men I am prepared to die standing and to despise a precarious life which every hour may depend on an accidental fever If I have been found unworthy of the command there are now among you I speak it with pride and pleasure there are many chiefs whose merit and experience are equal to the conduct of the most important war Such has been the temper of my reign that I can retire without regret and without apprehension to the obscurity of a private station  I give this speech as original and genuine Ammianus might hear could transcribe and was incapable of inventing it I have used some slight freedoms and conclude with the most forcible sentence    The modest resolution of Julian was answered by the unanimous applause and cheerful obedience of the Romans who declared their confidence of  victory while they fought under the banners of their heroic prince Their courage was kindled by his frequent and familiar asseverations for such wishes were the oaths of Julian  So may I reduce the Persians under the yoke  Thus may I restore the strength and splendour of the republic  The love of fame was the ardent passion of his soul but it was not before he trampled on the ruins of Maogamalcha that he allowed himself to say  We have now provided some materials for the sophist of Antioch  Ammian xxiv Libanius Orat Parent c p    The successful valour of Julian had triumphed  He transports his fleet from the Euphrates to the Tigris  over all the obstacles that opposed his march to the gates of Ctesiphon But the reduction or even the siege of the capital of Persia was still at a distance nor can the military conduct of the emperor be clearly apprehended without a knowledge of the country which was the theatre of his bold and skilful operations  M d'Anville Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xxviii p has ascertained the true position and distance of Babylon Seleucia Ctesiphon Bagdad c The Roman traveller Pietro della Valle tom i lett xvii p seems to be the most intelligent spectator of that famous province He is a gentleman and a scholar but intolerably vain and prolix  Twenty miles to the south of Bagdad and on the eastern bank of the Tigris the curiosity of travellers has observed some ruins of the palaces of Ctesiphon which in the time of Julian was a great and populous city The name and glory of the adjacent Seleucia were for ever extinguished and the only remaining quarter of that Greek colony had resumed with the Assyrian language and manners the primitive appellation of Coche  Coche was situate on the western side of the Tigris but it was naturally considered as a suburb of Ctesiphon with which we may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats The united parts contributed to form the common epithet of Al Modain THE CITIES which the Orientals have bestowed on the winter residence of the Sassanides and the whole circumference of the Persian capital was strongly fortified by the waters of the river by lofty walls and by impracticable morasses Near the ruins of Seleucia the camp of Julian was fixed and secured by a ditch and rampart against the sallies of the numerous and enterprising garrison of Coche In this fruitful and pleasant country the Romans were plentifully supplied with water and forage and several forts which might have embarrassed the motions of the army submitted after some resistance to the efforts of their valour The fleet passed from the Euphrates into an artificial derivation of that river which pours a copious and navigable stream into the Tigris at a small distance  below  the great city If they had followed this royal canal which bore the name of NaharMalcha  The royal canal  NaharMalcha  might be successively restored altered divided c Cellarius Geograph Antiq tom ii p and these changes may serve to explain the seeming contradictions of antiquity In the time of Julian it must have fallen into the Euphrates  below  Ctesiphon  the intermediate situation of Coche would have separated the fleet and army of Julian and the rash attempt of steering against the current of the Tigris and  forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital must have been attended with the total destruction of the Roman navy The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger and provided the remedy As he had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in the same country he soon recollected that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal which leaving Coche on the righthand conveyed the waters of the NaharMalcha into the river Tigris at some distance  above  the cities From the information of the peasants Julian ascertained the vestiges of this ancient work which were almost obliterated by design or accident By the indefatigable labour of the soldiers a broad and deep channel was speedily prepared for the reception of the Euphrates A strong dike was constructed to interrupt the ordinary current of the NaharMalcha a flood of waters rushed impetuously into their new bed and the Roman fleet steering their triumphant course into the Tigris derided the vain and ineffectual barriers which the Persians of Ctesiphon had erected to oppose their passage  As it became necessary to transport the Roman  Passage of the Tigris and victory of the Romans  army over the Tigris another labour presented itself of less toil but of more danger than the preceding expedition The stream was broad and rapid the ascent steep and difficult and the intrenchments which had been formed on the ridge of the opposite bank were lined with a numerous army of heavy cuirassiers dextrous  archers and huge elephants who according to the extravagant hyperbole of Libanius could trample with the same ease a field of corn or a legion of Romans  Rien n'est beau que le vrai a maxim which should be inscribed on the desk of every rhetorician  In the presence of such an enemy the construction of a bridge was impracticable and the intrepid prince who instantly seized the only possible expedient concealed his design till the moment of execution from the knowledge of the Barbarians of his own troops and even of his generals themselves Under the specious pretence of examining the state of the magazines fourscore vessels were gradually unladen and a select detachment apparently destined for some secret expedition was ordered to stand to their arms on the first signal Julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own mind with smiles of confidence and joy and amused the hostile nations with the spectacle of military games which he insultingly celebrated under the walls of Coche The day was consecrated to pleasure but as soon as the hour of supper was past the emperor summoned the generals to his tent and acquainted them that he had fixed that night for the passage of the Tigris They stood in silent and respectful astonishment but when the venerable Sallust assumed the privilege of his age and experience the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the weight of his prudent  remonstrances  Libanius alludes to the most powerful of the generals I have ventured to name  Sallust  Ammianus says of all the leaders quòd aeri metû territi duces concordi precatû fieri prohibere tentarent  Julian contented himself with observing that conquest and safety depended on the attempt that instead of diminishing the number of their enemies would be increased by successive reinforcements and that a longer delay would neither contract the breadth of the stream nor level the height of the bank The signal was instantly given and obeyed the most impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest to the bank and as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence they were lost after a few moments in the darkness of the night A flame arose on the opposite side and Julian who too clearly understood that his foremost vessels in attempting to land had been fired by the enemy dexterously converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory  Our fellowsoldiers he eagerly exclaimed are already masters of the bank seethey make the appointed signal let us hasten to emulate and assist their courage  The united and rapid motion of a great fleet broke the violence of the current and they reached the eastern shore of the Tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the flames and rescue their adventurous companions The difficulties of a sleep and lofty ascent were increased by the weight of armour and the darkness of the night A shower of stones darts and fire was incessantly discharged on the heads of the assailants who after an  arduous struggle climbed the bank and stood victorious upon the rampart As soon as they possessed a more equal field Julian who with his lightinfantry had led the attack  Hinc Imperator says Ammianus ipse cum levis armaturae auxiliis per prima postremaque

distributed in the front and rear and all the trumpets of the Imperial army founded to battle The Romans after sending up a military shout advanced in measured steps to the animating notes of martial music launched their formidable javelins and rushed forwards with drawn swords to deprive the Barbarians by a closer onset of the advantage of their missile weapons The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself They were pursued to the gates of Ctesiphon and the conquerors might have entered the dismayed city  Persas terrore subito miscuerunt versisque agminibus totius gentis apertas Ctesiphontis portas victor miles intrâsset ni major praedarum occasio fuisset quam cura victoriae Sextus Rufus de Provinciis c Their avarice might dispose them to hear the advice of Victor  if their general Victor who was dangerously wounded with  an arrow had not conjured them to desist from a rash attempt which must be fatal if it were not successful On  their  side the Romans acknowledged the loss of only seventyfive men while they affirmed that the Barbarians had left on the field of battle two thousand five hundred or even six thousand of their bravest soldiers The spoil was such as might be expected from the riches and luxury of an Oriental camp large quantities of silver and gold splendid arms and trappings and beds and tables of massy silver The victorious emperor distributed as the rewards of valour some honourable gifts civic and mural and naval crowns which he and perhaps he alone esteemed more precious than the wealth of Asia A solemn sacrifice was offered to the god of war but the appearances of the victims threatened the most inauspicious events and Julian soon discovered by less ambiguous signs that he had now reached the term of his prosperity  The labour of the canal the passage of the Tigris and the victory are described by Ammianus xxiv Libanius Orat Parent c p Greg Nazianzen Orat iv p Zosimus l iii p and Sextus Rufus de Provinciis c    On the second day after the battle the domestic guards the

historian Ammianus and the future emperor Jovian actually served some  schools  of the  domestics  and perhaps the Jovians and Herculians who often did duty as guards  While the Persians beheld  from the walls of Ctesiphon the desolation of the adjacent country Julian cast many an anxious look towards the North in full expectation that as he himself had victoriously penetrated to the capital of Sapor the march and junction of his lieutenants Sebastian and Procopius would be executed with the same courage and diligence His expectations were disappointed by the treachery of the Armenian king who permitted and most probably directed the desertion of his auxiliary troops from the camp of the Romans  Moses of Chorene Hist Armen l iii c p supplies us with a national tradition and a spurious letter I have borrowed only the leading circumstance which is consistent with truth probability and Libanius Orat Parent c p  and by the dissentions of the two generals who were incapable of forming or executing any plan for the public service When the emperor had relinquished the hope of this important reinforcement he condescended to hold a council of war and approved after a full debate the sentiment of those generals who dissuaded the siege of Ctesiphon as a fruitless and pernicious undertaking It is not easy for us to conceive by what arts of fortification a city thrice besieged and taken by the predecessors of Julian could be rendered impregnable against an army of sixty thousand Romans commanded by a brave and experienced general and abundantly supplied  with ships provisions battering engines and military stores But we may rest assured from the love of glory and contempt of danger which formed the character of Julian that he was not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obstacles  Civitas inexpugnabilis facinus audax et importunum Ammianus xxiv His fellowsoldier Eutropius turns aside from the difficulty Assyriamque populatus castra apud Ctesiphontem stativa aliquandiu habuit remeansque victor c x Zosimus is artful or ignorant and Socrates inaccurate  At the very time when he declined the siege of Ctesiphon he rejected with obstinacy and disdain the most flattering offers of a negociation of peace Sapor who had been so long accustomed to the tardy ostentation of Constantius was surprised by the intrepid diligence of his successor As far as the confines of India and Scythia the satraps of the distant provinces were ordered to assemble their troops and to march without delay to the assistance of their monarch But their preparations were dilatory their motions slow and before Sapor could lead an army into the field he received the melancholy intelligence of the devastation of Assyria the ruin of his palaces and the slaughter of his bravest troops who defended the passage of the Tigris The pride of royalty was humbled in the dust he took his repasts on the ground and the disorder of his hair expressed the grief and anxiety of his mind Perhaps he would not have refused to purchase with one half of his kingdom the safety of the remainder and he would have gladly subscribed himself in a treaty of peace  the faithful and dependent ally of the Roman conqueror Under the pretence of private business a minister of rank and confidence was secretly dispatched to embrace the knees of Hormisdas and to request in the language of a suppliant that he might be introduced into the presence of the emperor The Sassanian prince whether he listened to the voice of pride or humanity whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth or the duties of his situation was equally inclined to promote a salutary measure which would terminate the calamities of Persia and secure the triumph of Rome He was astonished by the inflexible firmness of a hero who remembered most unfortunately for himself and for his country that Alexander had uniformly rejected the propositions of Darius But as Julian was sensible that the hope of a safe and honourable peace might cool the ardour of his troops he earnestly requested that Hormisdas would privately dismiss the minister of Sapor and conceal this dangerous temptation from the knowledge of the camp  Libanius Orat Parent c p c p Socrates l iii c The ecclesiastical historian imputes the refusal of peace to the advice of Maximus Such advice was unworthy of a philosopher but the philosopher was likewise a magician who flattered the hopes and passions of his master    The honour as well as interest of Julian  He burns his fleet  forbade him to consume his time under the impregnable walls of Ctesiphon and as often as he defied the Barbarians who defended the city to meet him on the open plain they prudently  replied that if he desired to exercise his valour he might seek the army of the Great King He felt the insult and he accepted the advice Instead of confining his servile march to the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris he resolved to imitate the adventurous spirit of Alexander and boldly to advance into the inland provinces till he forced his rival to contend with him perhaps in the plains of Arbela for the empire of Asia The magnanimity of Julian was applauded and betrayed by the arts of a noble Persian who in the cause of his country had generously submitted to act a part full of danger of falsehood and of shame  The arts of this new Zopyrus Greg Nazianzen Orat iv p may derive some credit from the testimony of two abbreviators Sextus Rufus and Victor and the casual hints of Libanius Orat Parent c p and Ammianus xxiv The course of genuine history is interrupted by a most unseasonable chasm in the text of Ammianus  With a train of faithful followers he deserted to the Imperial camp exposed in a specious tale the injuries which he had sustained exaggerated the cruelty of Sapor the discontent of the people and the weakness of the monarchy and confidently offered himself as the hostage and guide of the Roman march The most rational grounds of suspicion were urged without effect by the wisdom and experience of Hormisdas and the credulous Julian receiving the traitor into his bosom was persuaded to issue an hasty order which in the opinion of mankind appeared to arraign his prudence and to endanger his safety He destroyed in a single hour the whole navy which had been  transported above five hundred miles at so great an expence of toil of treasure and of blood Twelve or at the most twentytwo small vessels were saved to accompany on carriages the march of the army and to form occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers A supply of twenty days provisions was reserved for the use of the soldiers and the rest of the magazines with a fleet of eleven hundred vessels which rode at anchor in the Tigris were abandoned to the flames by the absolute command of the emperor The Christian bishops Gregory and Augustin insult the madness of the apostate who executed with his own hands the sentence of divine justice Their authority of less weight perhaps in a military question is confirmed by the cool judgment of an experienced soldier who was himself spectator of the conflagration and who could not disapprove the reluctant murmurs of the troops  See Ammianus xxiv Libanius Orat Parentalis c p Zosimus l iii p Zonaras tom ii l xiii p Gregory Orat iv p Augustin de Civitate Dei l iv c l v c Of these Libanius alone attempts a faint apology for his hero who according to Ammianus pronounced his own condemnation by a tardy and ineffectual attempt to extinguish the flames  Yet there are not wanting some specious and perhaps solid reasons which might justify the resolution of Julian The navigation of the Euphrates never ascended above Babylon nor that of the Tigris above Opis  Consult Herodotus l i c Strabo l xvi p and Tavernier p i l ii p  The distance of the lastmentioned city from the Roman camp was not very considerable  and Julian must soon have renounced the vain and impracticable attempt of forcing upwards a great fleet against the stream of a rapid river  A celeritate Tigris incipit vocari ita appellant Medi sagittam Plin Hist Natur vi  which in several places was embarrassed by natural or artificial cataracts  One of these dykes which produces an artificial cascade or cataract is described by Tavernier part i l ii p and Thevenot part ii l p The Persians or Assyrians laboured to interrupt the navigation of the river Strabo l xv p D'Anville l'Euphrate et le Tigre p  The power of sails or oars was insufficient it became necessary to tow the ships against the current of the river the strength of twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servile labour and if the Romans continued to march along the banks of the Tigris they could only expect to return home without atchieving any enterprize worthy of the genius or fortune of their leader If on the contrary it was adviseable to advance into the inland country the destruction of the fleet and magazines was the only measure which could save that valuable prize from the hands of the numerous and active troops which might suddenly be poured from the gates of Ctesiphon Had the arms of Julian been victorious we should now admire the conduct as well as the courage of a hero who by depriving his soldiers of the hopes of a retreat left them only the alternative of death or conquest  Recollect the successful and applauded rashness of Agathocles and Cortez who burnt their ships on the coasts of Africa and Mexico    The cumbersome train of artillery and waggons which retards the operations of a modern army were in a great measure unknown in the  and marches against Sapor  camps of the Romans  See the judicious reflections of the Author of the Essai sur la Tactique tom ii p and the learned remarks of M Guichardt Nouveaux Memoires Militaires tom i p on the baggage and subsistence of the Roman armies  Yet in every age the subsistence of sixty thousand men must have been one of the most important cares of a prudent general and that subsistence could only be drawn from his own or from the enemy's country Had it been possible for Julian to maintain a bridge of communication on the Tigris and to preserve the conquered places of Assyria a desolated province could not afford any large or regular supplies in a season of the year when the lands were covered by the inundation of the Euphrates  The Tigris rises to the south the Euphrates to the north of the Armenian mountains The former overflows in March the latter in July These circumstances are well explained in the Geographical Dissertation of Foster inserted in Spelman's Expedition of Cyrus vol ii p  and the unwholesome air was darkened with swarms of innumerable insects  Ammianus xxiv describes as he had felt the inconveniency of the flood the heat and the insects The lands of Assyria oppressed by the Turks and ravaged by the Curds or Arabs yield an increase of ten fifteen and twenty fold for the seed which is cast into the ground by the wretched and unskilful husbandman Voyages de Niebuhr tom ii p  The appearance of the hostile country was far more inviting The extensive region that lies between the river Tigris and the mountains of Media was filled with villages and towns and the fertile soil for the most part was in a very improved state of  cultivation Julian might expect that a conqueror who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion steel and gold would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives But on the approach of the Romans this rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted Wherever they moved the inhabitants deserted the open villages and took shelter in the fortified towns the cattle was driven away the grass and ripe corn were consumed with fire and as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of Julian he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert This desperate but effectual method of defence can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their independence to their property or by the rigour of an arbitrary government which consults the public safety without submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice On the present occasion the zeal and obedience of the Persians seconded the commands of Sapor and the emperor was soon reduced to the scanty stock of provisions which continually wasted in his hands Before they were entirely consumed he might still have reached the wealthy and unwarlike cities of Ecbatana or Susa by the effort of a rapid and welldirected march  Isidore of Charax Mansion Parthic p in Hudson Geograph Minor tom ii reckons schaeni from Seleucia and Thevenot part i l i ii p hours of march from Bagdad to Ecbatana or Hamadam These measures cannot exceed an ordinary parasang or three Roman miles  but he was deprived of this last resource by his ignorance of the roads and by  the perfidy of his guides The Romans wandered several days in the country to the eastward of Bagdad the Persian deserter who had artfully led them into the snare escaped from their resentment and his followers as soon as they were put to the torture confessed the secret of the conspiracy The visionary conquests of Hyrcania and India which had so long amused now tormented the mind of Julian Conscious that his own imprudence was the cause of the public distress he anxiously balanced the hopes of safety or success without obtaining a satisfactory answer either from gods or men At length as the only practicable measure he embraced the resolution of directing his steps towards the banks of the Tigris with the design of saving the army by a hasty march to the confines of Corduene a fertile and friendly province which acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome The desponding troops obeyed the signal of the retreat only seventy days after they had passed the Chaboras with the sanguine  June  expectation of subverting the throne of Persia  The march of Julian from Ctesiphon is circumstantially but not clearly described by Ammianus xxiv Libanius Orat Parent c p and Zosimus l iii p The two last seem ignorant that their conqueror was retreating and Libanius absurdly confines him to the banks of the Tigris    As long as the Romans seemed to advance  Retreat and distress of the Roman army  into the country their march was observed and insulted from a distance by several bodies of Persian cavalry who shewing themselves sometimes in loose and sometimes in closer order  faintly skirmished with the advanced guards These detachments were however supported by a much greater force and the heads of the columns were no sooner pointed towards the Tigris than a cloud of dust arose on the plain The Romans who now aspired only to the permission of a safe and speedy retreat endeavoured to persuade themselves that this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop of wild asses or perhaps by the approach of some friendly Arabs They halted pitched their tents fortified their camp passed the whole night in continual alarms and discovered at the dawn of day that they were surrounded by an army of Persians This army which might be considered only as the van of the Barbarians was soon followed by the main body of cuirassiers archers and elephants commanded by Meranes a general of rank and reputation He was accompanied by two of the king's sons and many of the principal satraps and fame and expectation exaggerated the strength of the remaining powers which slowly advanced under the conduct of Sapor himself As the Romans continued their march their long array which was forced to bend or divide according to the varieties of the ground afforded frequent and favourable opportunities to their vigilant enemies The Persians repeatedly charged with fury they were repeatedly repulsed with firmness and the action at Maronga which almost deserved the name of a battle was marked by a considerable loss of satraps and elephants perhaps of equal value in the eyes  of their monarch These splendid advantages were not obtained without an adequate slaughter on the side of the Romans several officers of distinction were either killed or wounded and the emperor himself who on all occasions of danger inspired and guided the valour of his troops was obliged to expose his person and exert his abilities The weight of offensive and defensive arms which still constituted the strength and safety of the Romans disabled them from making any long or effectual pursuit and as the horsemen of the East were trained to dart their javelins and shoot their arrows at full speed and in every possible direction  Chardin the most judicious of modern travellers describes tom iii p c edit in to the education and dexterity of the Persian horsemen Brissonius de Regno Persico p c has collected the testimonies of antiquity  the cavalry of Persia was never more formidable than in the moment of a rapid and disorderly flight But the most certain and irreparable loss of the Romans was that of time The hardy veterans accustomed to the cold climate of Gaul and Germany fainted under the sultry heat of an Assyrian summer their vigour was exhausted by the incessant repetition of march and combat and the progress of the army was suspended by the precautions of a slow and dangerous retreat in the presence of an active enemy Every day every hour as the supply diminished the value and price of subsistence increased in the Roman  camp  In Mark Antony's retreat an attic chaenix sold for fifty drachmae or in other words a pound of flour for twelve or fourteen shillings barleybread was sold for its weight in silver It is impossible to peruse the interesting narrative of Plutarch tom v p without perceiving that Mark Antony and Julian were pursued by the same enemies and involved in the same distress  Julian who always contented himself with such food as a hungry soldier would have disdained distributed for the use of the troops the provisions of the Imperial household and whatever could be spared from the sumpterhorses of the tribunes and generals But this feeble relief served only to aggravate the sense of the public distress and the Romans began to entertain the most gloomy apprehensions that before they could reach the frontiers of the empire they should all perish either by famine or by the sword of the Barbarians  Ammian xxiv xxv Zosimus l iii p Libanius Orat Parent c p The sophist of Antioch appears ignorant that the troops were hungry    While Julian struggled with the almost insuperable  Julian is mortally wounded  difficulties of his situation the silent hours of the night were still devoted to study and contemplation Whenever he closed his eyes in short and interrupted slumbers his mind was agitated with painful anxiety nor can it be thought surprising that the Genius of the empire should once more appear before him covering with a funereal veil his head and his horn of abundance and slowly retiring from the Imperial tent The monarch started from his couch and stepping forth to refresh his wearied spirits with the coolness of the midnight air he beheld a  fiery meteor which shot athwart the sky

Persians Julian led the van with the skill and attention of a consummate general he was alarmed by the intelligence that his rear was suddenly attacked The heat of the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass but he snatched a shield from one of his attendants and hastened with a sufficient reinforcement to the relief of the rearguard A similar danger recalled the intrepid prince to the defence of the front and as he galloped between the columns the centre of the left was attacked and almost overpowered by a furious charge of the Persian cavalry and elephants This huge body was soon defeated by the welltimed  evolution of the light infantry who aimed their weapons with dexterity and effect against the backs of the horsemen and the legs of the elephants The Barbarians fled and Julian who was foremost in every danger animated the pursuit with his voice and gestures His trembling guards scattered and oppressed by the disorderly throng of friends and enemies reminded their fearless sovereign that he was without armour and conjured him to decline the fall of the impending ruin As they exclaimed  Clamabant hinc inde  candidati  see the note of Valesius quos disjecerat terror ut fugientium molem tanquam ruinam male compositi culminis declinaret Ammian xxv  a cloud of darts and arrows was discharged from the flying squadrons and a javelin after razing the skin of his arm transpierced the ribs and fixed in the inferior part of the liver Julian attempted to draw the deadly weapon from his side but his fingers were cut by the sharpness of the steel and he fell senseless from his horse His guards flew to his relief and the wounded emperor was gently raised from the ground and conveyed out of the tumult of the battle into an adjacent tent The report of the melancholy event passed from rank to rank but the grief of the Romans inspired them with invincible valour and the desire of revenge The bloody and obstinate conflict was maintained by the two armies till they were separated by the total darkness of the night The Persians derived some honour from the advantage which they obtained  against the left wing where Anatolius master of the offices was slain and the praefect Sallust very narrowly escaped But the event of the day was adverse to the Barbarians They abandoned the field their two generals Meranes and Nohordates  Sapor himself declared

martial spirit He called for his horse and arms and was impatient to rush into the battle His remaining strength was exhausted by the painful effort and the surgeons who examined his wound discovered the symptoms of approaching death He employed the awful moments with the firm temper of a hero and a sage the philosophers who had accompanied him in this fatal expedition compared the tent of Julian with the prison of Socrates and the spectators whom duty or friendship or curiosity had assembled round his couch listened with respectful grief to the funeral oration of their dying emperor  The character and situation of Julian might countenance the suspicion that he had previously composed the elaborate oration which Ammianus heard and has transcribed The version of the Abbé de la Bleterie is faithful and elegant I have followed him in expressing the Platonic idea of emanations which is darkly insinuated in the original    Friends and fellowsoldiers the  seasonable period of my departure is now arrived and I discharge with the cheerfulness of a ready debtor the demands of nature I have learned from philosophy how much the soul is more excellent than the body and that the separation of the nobler substance should be the subject of joy rather than of affliction I have learned from religion that an early death has often been the reward of piety  Herodotus l i c has displayed that doctrine in an agreeable tale Yet the Jupiter in the th book of the Iliad who laments with tears of blood the death of Sarpedon his son had a very imperfect notion of happiness or glory beyond the grave  and I accept as a favour of the gods the mortal stroke that secures me from the danger of disgracing a character which has hitherto been supported by virtue and fortitude I die without remorse as I have lived without guilt I am pleased to reflect on the innocence of my private life and I can affirm with confidence that the supreme authority that emanation of the Divine Power has been preserved in my hands pure and immaculate Detesting the corrupt and destructive maxims of despotism I have considered the happiness of the people as the end of government Submitting my actions to the laws of prudence of justice and of moderation I have trusted the event to the care of Providence Peace was the object of my counsels as long as peace  was consistent with the public welfare but when the imperious voice of my country summoned me to arms I exposed my person to the dangers of war with the clear foreknowledge which I had acquired from the art of divination that I was destined to fall by the sword I now offer my tribute of gratitude to the Eternal Being who has not suffered me to perish by the cruelty of a tyrant by the secret dagger of conspiracy or by the slow tortures of lingering disease He has given me in the midst of an honourable career a splendid and glorious departure from this world and I hold it equally absurd equally base to solicit or to decline the stroke of fateThus much I have attempted to say but my strength fails me and I feel the approach of deathI shall cautiously refrain from any word that may tend to influence your suffrages in the election of an emperor My choice might be imprudent or injudicious and if it should not be ratified by the consent of the army it might be fatal to the person whom I should recommend I shall only as a good citizen express my hopes that the Romans may be blessed with the government of a virtuous sovereign  After this discourse which Julian pronounced in a firm and gentle tone of voice he distributed

was killed and bewailed with amiable inconsistency the loss of his friend At the same time he reproved the immoderate grief of the spectators and conjured them not to disgrace by unmanly tears the fate of a prince who in a few moments would be united with heaven and with the stars  This union of the human soul with the divine aetherial substance of the universe is the ancient doctrine of Pythagoras and Plato but it seems to exclude any personal or conscious immortality See Warburton's learned and rational observations Divine Legation vol ii p  The spectators were silent and Julian entered into a metaphysical argument with the philosophers Priscus and Maximus on the nature of the soul The efforts which he made of mind as well as body most probably hastened his death His wound began to bleed with fresh violence his respiration was embarrassed by the swelling of the veins he called for a draught of cold water and as soon as he had drank it expired without pain about the hour of midnight Such was the end of that extraordinary man in the thirtysecond year of his age after a reign of one year and about eight months from the death of Constantius In his last moments he displayed perhaps with some ostentation the love of virtue  and of fame which had been the ruling passions of his life  The whole relation of the death of Julian is given by Ammianus xxv an intelligent spectator Libanius who turns with horror from the scene has supplied some circumstances Orat Parental c p The calumnies of Gregory and the legends of more ancient saints may now be  silently  despised    The triumph of Christianity and the calamities  Election of the emperor Jovian A D June  of the empire may in some measure be ascribed to Julian himself who had neglected to secure the future execution of his designs by the timely and judicious nomination of an associate and successor But the royal race of Constantius Chlorus was reduced to his own person and if he entertained any serious thoughts of investing with the purple the most worthy among the Romans he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the choice the jealousy of power the fear of ingratitude and the natural presumption of health of youth and of prosperity His unexpected death left the empire without a master and without an heir in a state of perplexity and danger which in the space of fourscore years had never been experienced since the election of Diocletian In a government which had almost forgotten the distinction of pure and noble blood the superiority of birth was of little moment the claims of official rank were accidental and precarious and the candidates who might aspire to ascend the vacant throne could be supported only by the consciousness of personal merit or by the hopes of popular favour But the situation of a famished army encompassed  on all sides by an host of Barbarians shortened the moments of grief and deliberation In this scene of terror and distress the body of the deceased prince according to his own directions was decently embalmed and at the dawn of day the generals convened a military senate at which the commanders of the legions and the officers both of cavalry and infantry were invited to assist Three or four hours of the night had not passed away without some secret cabals and when the election of an emperor was proposed the spirit of faction began to agitate the assembly Victor and Arinthaeus collected the remains of the court of Constantius the friends of Julian attached themselves to the Gallic chiefs Dagalaiphus and Nevitta and the most fatal consequences might be apprehended from the discord of two factions so opposite in their character and interest in their maxims of government and perhaps in their religious principles The superior virtues of Sallust could alone reconcile their divisions and unite their suffrages and the venerable praefect would immediately have been declared the successor of Julian if he himself with sincere and modest firmness had not alleged his age and infirmities so unequal to the weight of the diadem The generals who were surprised and perplexed by his refusal shewed some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an inferior officer  Honoratior aliquis miles perhaps Ammianus himself The modest and judicious historian describes the scene of the election at which he was undoubtedly present xxv  that they should act as they  would have acted in the absence of the emperor that they should exert their abilities to extricate the army from the present distress and if they were fortunate enough to reach the confines of Mesopotamia they should proceed with united and deliberate counsels in the election of a lawful sovereign While they debated a few voices saluted Jovian who was no more than  first  The  primus  or  primicerius  enjoyed the dignity of a senator and though only a tribune he ranked with the military dukes Cod Theodosian l vi tit xxiv These privileges are perhaps more recent than the time of Jovian  of the domestics with the names of Emperor and Augustus The tumultuary acclamation was instantly repeated by the guards who surrounded the tent and passed in a few minutes to the extremities of the line The new prince astonished with his own fortune was hastily invested with the Imperial ornaments and received an oath of fidelity from the generals whose favour and protection he so lately solicited The strongest recommendation of Jovian was the merit of his father Count Varronian who enjoyed in honourable retirement the fruit of his long services In the obscure freedom of a private station the son indulged his taste for wine and women yet he supported with credit the character of a Christian  The ecclesiastical historians Socrates l iii c Sozomen l vi c and Theodoret l iv c ascribe to Jovian the merit of a confessor under the preceding reign and piously suppose that he refused the purple till the whole army unanimously exclaimed that they were Christians Ammianus calmly pursuing his narrative overthrows the legend by a single sentence Hostiis pro Joviano extisque inspectis pronuntiatum est c xxv  and a soldier Without being conspicuous  for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and envy of mankind the comely person of Jovian his cheerful temper and familiar wit had gained the affection of his fellowsoldiers and the generals of both parties acquiesced in a popular election which had not been conducted by the arts of their enemies The pride of this unexpected elevation was moderated by the just apprehension that the same day might terminate the life and reign of the new emperor The pressing voice of necessity was obeyed without delay and the first orders issued by Jovian a few hours after his predecessor had expired were to prosecute a march which could alone extricate the Romans from their actual distress  Ammianus xxx has drawn from the life an impartial portrait of Jovian to which the younger Victor has added some remarkable strokes The Abbé de la Bleterie Histoire de Jovien tom i p has composed an elaborate history of his short reign a work

the whole weight of his united forces on the rearguard of the Romans The rearguard was thrown into disorder the renowned legions which derived their titles from Diocletian and his warlike colleague were broke and trampled down by the elephants and three tribunes lost their lives in attempting to stop the flight of their soldiers The battle was at length restored by the persevering valour of the Romans the Persians were repulsed with a great slaughter of men and elephants and the army after marching and fighting a long summer's day arrived in the evening at Samara on the banks of the Tigris about one hundred miles above Ctesiphon  The obscure villages of the inland country are irrecoverably lost nor can we name the field of battle where Julian fell but M d'Anville has demonstrated the precise situation of Sumere Carche and Dura along the banks of the Tigris Geographie Ancienne tom ii p l'Euphrate et le Tigre p In the ninth century Sumere or Samara became with a slight change of name the royal residence of the Khalifs of the house of Abbas  On the ensuing day the Barbarians instead of harassing the march attacked the camp of Jovian which had been seated in a deep and sequestered valley From the hills the archers of Persia insulted and annoyed the wearied legionaries and a body of cavalry which had penetrated with desperate courage through the Praetorian gate was cut in pieces after a doubtful conflict near the Imperial tent In the succeeding night the camp of Carche was protected by the lofty dykes of the river and the Roman army though incessantly exposed to the vexatious  pursuit of the Saracens pitched their tents near the city of Dura  Dura was a fortified place in the wars of Antiochus against the rebels of Media and Persia Polybius l v c p edit Casaubon in vo  four days after the death of Julian The Tigris was still on their left their hopes and provisions were almost consumed and the impatient soldiers who had fondly persuaded themselves that the frontiers of the empire were not far distant requested their new sovereign that they might be permitted to hazard the passage of the river With the assistance of his wisest officers Jovian endeavoured to check their rashness by representing that if they possessed sufficient skill and vigour to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream they would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless to the Barbarians who had occupied the opposite banks Yielding at length to their clamorous importunities he consented with reluctance that five hundred Gauls and Germans accustomed from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and Danube should attempt the bold adventure which might serve either as an encouragement or as a warning for the rest of the army In the silence of the night they swam the Tigris surprised an unguarded post of the enemy and displayed at the dawn of day the signal of their resolution and fortune The success of this trial disposed the emperor to listen to the promises of his architects who proposed to construct a floating bridge of the inflated skins of sheep oxen  and goats covered with a floor of earth and fascines  A similar expedient was proposed to the leaders of the ten thousand and wisely rejected Xenophon Anabasis l iii p It appears from our modern travellers that rafts floating on bladders perform the trade and navigation of the Tigris  Two important days were spent in the ineffectual labour and the Romans who already endured the miseries of famine cast a look of despair on the Tigris and upon the Barbarians whose numbers and obstinacy increased with the distress of the Imperial army  The first military acts of the reign of Jovian are related by Ammianus xxv Libanius Orat Parent c p and Zosimus l iii p Though we may distrust the fairness of Libanius the ocular testimony of Eutropius uno a Persis atque altero proelio victus x must incline us to suspect that Ammianus has been too jealous of the honour of the Roman arms    In this hopeless situation the fainting spirits of  Negotiation and treaty of peace July  the Romans were revived by the sound of peace The transient presumption of Sapor had vanished he observed with serious concern that in the repetition of doubtful combats he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles his bravest troops and the greatest part of his train of elephants and the experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair the vicissitudes of fortune and the unexhausted powers of the Roman empire which might soon advance to relieve or to revenge the successor of Julian The Surenas himself accompanied by another satrap appeared in the camp of Jovian  Sextus Rufus de Provinciis c embraces a poor subterfuge of national vanity Tanta reverentia nominis Romani fuit ut a Persis  primus  de pace sermo haberetur  and declared that the clemency of his sovereign was  not averse to signify the conditions on which he would consent to spare and to dismiss the Caesar with the relics of his captive army The hopes of safety subdued the firmness of the Romans the emperor was compelled by the advice of his council and the cries of the soldiers to embrace the offer of peace and the praefect Sallust was immediately sent with the general Arinthaeus to understand the pleasure of the Great King The crafty Persian delayed under various pretences the conclusion of the agreement started difficulties required explanations suggested expedients receded from his concessions encreased his demands and wasted four days in the arts of negociation till he had consumed the stock of provisions which yet remained in the camp of the Romans Had Jovian been capable of executing a bold and prudent measure he would have continued his march with unremitting diligence the progress of the treaty would have suspended the attacks of the Barbarians and before the expiration of the fourth day he might have safely reached the fruitful province of Corduene at the distance only of one hundred miles  It is presumptuous to controvert the opinion of Ammianus a soldier and a spectator Yet it is difficult to understand  how  the mountains of Corduene could extend over the plain of Assyria as low as the conflux of the Tigris and the great Zab or  how  an army of sixty thousand men could march one hundred miles in four days  The irresolute emperor instead of breaking through the toils of the enemy expected his fate with patient resignation and accepted the humiliating conditions of peace which it  was no longer in his power to refuse The five provinces beyond the Tigris which had been ceded by the grandfather of Sapor were restored to the Persian monarchy He acquired by a single article the impregnable city of Nisibis which had sustained in three successive sieges the effort of his arms Singara and the castle of the Moors one of the strongest places of Mesopotamia were likewise dismembered from the empire It was considered as an indulgence that the inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted to retire with their effects but the conqueror rigorously insisted that the Romans should for ever abandon the king and kingdom of Armenia A peace or rather a long truce of thirty years was stipulated between the hostile nations the faith of the treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and religious ceremonies and hostages of distinguished rank were reciprocally delivered to secure the performance of the conditions  The treaty of Dura is recorded with grief or indignation by Ammianus xxv Libanius Orat Parent c p Zosimus l iii p Gregory Nazianzen Orat iv p who imputes the distress to Julian the deliverance to Jovian and Eutropius x The lastmentioned writer who was present in a military station styles this peace necessariam quidem sed ignobilem    The sophist of Antioch who saw with indignation  The weakness and disgrace of Jovian  the sceptre of his hero in the feeble hand of a Christian successor professes to admire the moderation of Sapor in contenting himself with so small a portion of the Roman empire If he had stretched as far as the Euphrates the claims  of his ambition he might have been secure says Libanius of not meeting with a refusal If he had fixed as the boundary of Persia the Orontes the Cydnus the Sangarius or even the Thracian Bosphorus flatterers would not have been wanting in the court of Jovian to convince the timid monarch that his remaining provinces would still afford the most ample gratifications of power and luxury  Libanius Orat Parent c p  Without adopting in its full force this malicious insinuation we must acknowledge that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was facilitated by the private ambition of Jovian The obscure domestic exalted to the throne by fortune rather than by merit was impatient to escape from the hands of the Persians that he might prevent the designs of Procopius who commanded the army of Mesopotamia and establish his doubtful reign over the legions and provinces which were still ignorant of the hasty and tumultuous choice of the camp beyond the Tigris  Conditionibus dispendiosis Romanae reipublicae impositis quibus cupidior regni quam

country to the resentment of a victorious monarch The difference of  their  conduct and success depended much more on their character than on their situation Instead of tamely resigning themselves to the secret deliberations and private views of a single person the united councils of the Greeks were inspired by the generous enthusiasm of a popular assembly where the mind of each citizen is filled with the love of glory the pride of freedom and the contempt of death Conscious of their superiority over the Barbarians in arms and discipline they disdained to yield they refused to capitulate every obstacle was surmounted by their patience courage and military skill and the memorable retreat of the ten thousand exposed and insulted the weakness of the Persian monarchy  The  Cyropaedia  is vague and languid the  Anabasis  circumstantial and animated Such is the eternal difference between fiction and truth    As the price of his disgraceful concessions the  He continues his retreat to Nisibis  emperor might perhaps have stipulated that the camp of the hungry Romans should be plentifully supplied  According to Rufinus an immediate supply of provisions was stipulated by the treaty and Theodoret affirms that the obligation was faithfully discharged by the Persians Such a fact is probable but undoubtedly false See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p  and that they should be permitted to pass the Tigris on the bridge which was constructed by the hands of the Persians But if  Jovian presumed to solicit those equitable terms they were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the East whose clemency had pardoned the invaders of his country The Saracens sometimes intercepted the stragglers of the march but the generals and troops of Sapor respected the cessation of arms and Jovian was suffered to explore the most convenient place for the passage of the river The small vessels which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet performed the most essential service They first conveyed the emperor and his favourites and afterwards transported in many successive voyages a great part of the army But as every man was anxious for his personal safety and apprehensive of being left on the hostile shore the soldiers who were too impatient to wait the slow returns of the boats boldly ventured themselves on light hurdles or inflated skins and drawing after them their horses attempted with various success to swim across the river Many of these daring adventurers were swallowed by the waves many others who were carried along by the violence of the stream fell an easy prey to the avarice or cruelty of the wild Arabs and the loss which the army sustained in the passage of the Tigris was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle As soon as the Romans had landed on the western bank they were delivered from the hostile pursuit of the Barbarians but in a laborious march of two hundred miles over the plains of Mesopotamia they endured the last extremities  of thirst and hunger They were obliged to traverse a sandy desert which in the extent of seventy miles did not afford a single blade of sweet grass nor a single spring of fresh water and the rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either of friends or enemies Whenever a small measure of flour could be discovered in the camp twenty pounds weight were greedily purchased with ten pieces of gold  We may recollect some lines of Lucan Pharsal iv who describes a similar distress of Caesar's army in Spain  Saeva fames aderat  Miles eget toto censû non prodigus

generals of Mesopotamia and the remains of a once flourishing army at length reposed  themselves under the walls of Nisibis The messengers of Jovian had already proclaimed in the language of flattery his election his treaty and his return and the new prince had taken the most effectual measures to secure the allegiance of the armies and provinces of Europe by placing the military command in the hands of those officers who from motives of interest or inclination would firmly support the cause of their benefactor  The retreat of Jovian is described by Ammianus xxv Libanius Orat Parent c p and Zosimus l iii p    The friends of Julian had confidently announced  Universal clamour against the treaty of peace  the success of his expedition They entertained a fond persuasion that the temples of the gods would be enriched with the spoils of the East that Persia would be reduced to the humble state of a tributary province governed by the laws and magistrates of Rome that the Barbarians would adopt the dress and manners and language of their conquerors and that the youth of Ecbatana and Susa would study the art of rhetoric under Grecian masters  Libanius Orat Parent c p Such were the natural hopes and wishes of a rhetorician  The progress of the arms of Julian interrupted his communication with the empire and from the moment that he passed the Tigris his affectionate subjects were ignorant of the fate and fortunes of their prince Their contemplation of fancied triumphs was disturbed by the melancholy rumour of his death and they persisted to doubt after  they could no longer deny the truth of that fatal event  The people of Carrhae a city devoted to Paganism buried the inauspicious messenger under a pile of stones Zosimus l iii p Libanius when he received the fatal intelligence cast his eye on his sword but he recollected that Plato had condemned suicide and that he must live to compose the panegyric of Julian Libanius de Vitâ suâ tom ii p  The messengers of Jovian promulgated the specious tale of a prudent and necessary peace the voice of fame louder and more sincere revealed the disgrace of the emperor and the conditions of the ignominious treaty The minds of the people were filled with astonishment and grief with indignation and terror when they were informed that the unworthy successor of Julian relinquished the five provinces which had been acquired by the victory of Galerius and that he shamefully surrendered to the Barbarians the important city of Nisibis the firmest bulwark of the provinces of the East  Ammianus and Eutropius may be admitted as fair and credible witnesses of the public language and opinions The people of Antioch reviled an ignominious peace which exposed them to the Persians on a naked and defenceless frontier Excerpt Valesiana p ex Johanne Antiocheno  The deep and dangerous question how far the public faith should be observed when it becomes incompatible with the public safety was freely agitated in popular conversation and some hopes were entertained that the emperor would redeem his pusillanimous behaviour by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy The inflexible spirit of the Roman senate had always disclaimed the unequal conditions which were extorted from the distress of her captive armies and if it were necessary  to satisfy the national honour by delivering the guilty general into the hands of the Barbarians the greatest part of the subjects of Jovian would have cheerfully acquiesced in the precedent of ancient times  The Abbé de la Bleterie Hist de Jovien tom i p though a severe casuist has pronounced that Jovian was not bound to execute his promise since he  could not  dismember the empire nor alienate without their consent the allegiance of his people I have never found much delight or instruction in such political metaphysics    But the emperor whatever might be the limits of his constitutional authority was the absolute  Jovian evacuates Nisibis and restores the five provinces to the Persians August  master of the laws and arms of the state and the same motives which had forced him to subscribe now pressed him to execute the treaty of peace He was impatient to secure an empire at the expence of a few provinces and the respectable names of religion and honour concealed the personal fears and the ambition of Jovian Notwithstanding the dutiful solicitations of the inhabitants decency as well as prudence forbade the emperor to lodge in the palace of Nisibis but the next morning after his arrival Bineses the ambassador of Persia entered the place displayed from the citadel the standard of the Great King and proclaimed in his name the cruel alternative of exile or servitude The principal citizens of Nisibis who till that fatal moment had confided in the protection of their sovereign threw themselves at his feet They conjured him not to abandon or at least not to deliver a faithful colony to the rage of a Barbarian tyrant exasperated  by the three successive defeats which he had experienced under the walls of Nisibis They still possessed arms and courage to repel the invaders of their country they requested only the permission of using them in their own defence and as soon as they had asserted their independence they should implore the favour of being again admitted into the rank of his subjects Their arguments their eloquence their tears were ineffectual Jovian alleged with some confusion the sanctity of oaths and as the reluctance with which he accepted the present of a crown of gold convinced the citizens of their hopeless condition the advocate Sylvanus was provoked to exclaim  O Emperor may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your dominions  Jovian who in a few weeks had assumed the habits of a prince  At Nisibis he performed a  royal  act A brave officer his namesake who had been thought worthy of the purple was dragged from supper thrown into a well and stoned to death without any form of trial or evidence of guilt Ammian xxv  was displeased with freedom and offended with truth and as he reasonably supposed that the discontent of the people might incline them to submit to the Persian government he published an edict under pain of death that they should leave the city within the term of three days Ammianus has delineated in lively colours the scene of universal despair which he seems to have viewed with an eye of compassion  See xxv and Zosimus l iii p  The martial youth deserted with indignant grief the walls which they had so gloriously defended the disconsolate  mourner dropt a last tear over the tomb of a son or husband which must soon be profaned by the rude hand of a Barbarian master and the aged citizen kissed the threshold and clung to the doors of the house where he had passed the cheerful and careless hours of infancy The highways were crowded with a trembling multitude the distinctions of rank and sex and age were lost in the general calamity Every one strove to bear away some fragment from the wreck of his fortunes and as they could not command the immediate service of an adequate number of horses or waggons they were obliged to leave behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects The savage insensibility of Jovian appears to have aggravated the hardships of these unhappy fugitives They were seated however in a newbuilt quarter of Amida and that rising city with the reinforcement of a very considerable colony soon recovered its former splendour and became the capital of Mesopotamia  Chron Paschal p The Ecclesiastical Notitiae may be consulted  Similar orders were dispatched by the emperor for the evacuation of Singara and the castle of the Moors and for the restitution of the five provinces beyond the Tigris Sapor enjoyed the glory and the fruits of his victory and this ignominious peace has justly been considered as a memorable aera in the decline and fall of the Roman empire The predecessors of Jovian had sometimes relinquished the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces but since the foundation  of the city the genius of Rome the god Terminus who guarded the boundaries of the republic had never retired before the sword of a victorious enemy  Zosimus l iii p Sextus Rufus de Provinciis c Augustin de Civitat Dei l iv c This general position must be applied and interpreted with some caution    After Jovian had performed those engagements  Reflections on the death  which the voice of his people might have tempted him to violate he hastened away from the scene of his disgrace and proceeded with his

cespititiâ quidem sequlturâ dignus  and Procopius who sincerely bewailed the loss of his kinsman was removed from the command of the army under the decent pretence of conducting the funeral The corpse of Julian was transported from Nisibis to Tarsus in a slow march of fifteen days and as it passed through the cities of the East was saluted by the hostile factions with mournful lamentations and clamorous insults The Pagans already placed their beloved hero in the rank of those gods whose worship he had restored while the invectives of the Christians pursued the soul  of the apostate to hell and his body to the grave  Compare the sophist and the saint Libanius Monod tom ii p and Orat Parent c p c p with Gregory Nazianzen Orat iv p The Christian orator faintly mutters some exhortations to modesty and forgiveness but he is well satisfied that the real sufferings of Julian will far exceed the fabulous torments of Ixion or Tantalus  One party lamented the approaching ruin of their altars the other celebrated the marvellous deliverance of the church The Christians applauded in lofty and ambiguous strains the stroke of divine vengeance which had been so long suspended over the guilty

ascribed the heroic deed to the obscure hand of some mortal or immortal champion of the faith  Sozomen l vi applauds the Greek doctrine of  tyrannicide  but the whole passage which a jesuit might have translated is prudently suppressed by the president Cousin  Such imprudent declarations were eagerly adopted by the malice or credulity of their adversaries  Immediately after the death of Julian an uncertain rumour was scattered telo cecidisse Romano It was carried by some deserters to the Persian camp and the Romans were reproached as the assassins of the emperor by Sapor and his subjects

darted the fatal javelin might be ignorant of its effect or he might be slain in the same action Ammianus neither feels nor inspires a suspicion  who darkly insinuated  or confidently asserted that

clergy Libanius de ulcis Jul nece c p La Bleterie Hist de Jovien tom i p  Above sixteen years after the death of Julian the charge was solemnly and vehemently urged in a public oration addressed by Libanius to the emperor Theodosius His suspicions are unsupported by fact or argument and we can only esteem the generous zeal of the sophist of Antioch for the cold and neglected ashes of his friend  The Orator Fabricius Bibliot Graec tom vii p scatters suspicions demands an inquiry and insinuates that proofs might still be obtained He describes the success of the Huns to the criminal neglect of revenging Julian's death    It was an ancient custom in the funerals as  and funeral of Julian  well as in the triumphs of the Romans that the voice of praise should be corrected by that of satire and ridicule and that in the midst of the splendid pageants which displayed the glory of the living or of the dead their imperfections should not be concealed from the eyes of the world  At the funeral of Vespasian the comedian who personated that frugal emperor anxiously enquired how much it costFourscore thousand pounds centiesGive me the tenth part of the sum and throw my body into the Tyber Sueton in Vespasian c with the notes of Casaubon and Gronovius  This custom was practised in the funeral of Julian The comedians who resented his contempt and aversion for the theatre exhibited with the applause of a Christian audience the lively and exaggerated representation  of the faults and follies of the deceased emperor His various character and singular manners afforded an ample scope for pleasantry and ridicule  Gregory Orat iv p compares this supposed ignominy and ridicule to the funeral honours of Constantius whose body was chaunted over mount Taurus by a choir of angels  In the exercise of his uncommon talents he often descended below the majesty of his rank Alexander was transformed into Diogenes the philosopher was degraded into a priest The purity of his virtue was sullied by excessive vanity his superstition disturbed the peace and endangered the safety of a mighty empire and his irregular sallies were the less intitled to indulgence as they appeared to be the laborious efforts of art or even of affectation The remains of Julian were interred at Tarsus in Cilicia but his stately tomb which arose in that city on the banks of the cold and limpid Cydnus  Quintus Curtius l iii c The luxuriancy of his descriptions has been often censured Yet it was almost the duty of the historian to describe a river whose waters had nearly proved fatal to Alexander

Ducange Famil Byzantin p Flattery is a foolish suicide she destroys herself with her own hands  and the first moments of peace were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore the domestic tranquillity of the church and state The indiscretion of his predecessor instead of reconciling had artfully fomented the religious war and the balance which he affected to preserve between the hostile factions served only to perpetuate the contest by the vicissitudes of hope and fear by the rival claims of ancient possession and actual favour The Christians had forgotten the spirit of the Gospel and the Pagans had imbibed the spirit of the church In private families the sentiments of nature were  extinguished by the blind fury of zeal and revenge the majesty of the laws was violated or abused the cities of the East were stained with blood and the most implacable enemies of the Romans were in the bosom of their country Jovian was educated in the profession of Christianity and as he marched from Nisibis to Antioch the banner of the Cross the LABARUM of Constantine which was again displayed at the head of the legions announced to the people the faith of their new emperor As soon as he ascended the throne he transmitted a circular epistle to all the governors of provinces in which he confessed the divine truth and secured the legal establishment of the Christian religion The insidious edicts of Julian were abolished the ecclesiastical immunities were restored and enlarged and Jovian condescended to lament that the distress of the times obliged him to diminish the measure of charitable distributions  Jovian restored to the church  a forcible and comprehensive expression Philostorgius l viii c with Godefroy's Dissertations p Sozomen l vi c The new law which condemned the rape or marriage of nuns Cod Theod l ix tit xxv leg is exaggerated by Sozomen who supposes that an amorous glance the adultery of the heart was punished with death by the evangelic legislator  The Christians were unanimous in the loud and sincere applause which they bestowed on the pious successor of Julian But they were still ignorant what creed or what synod he would chuse for the standard of orthodoxy and the peace of the church immediately revived those  eager disputes which had been suspended during the season of persecution The episcopal leaders of the contending sects convinced from experience how much their fate would depend on the earliest impressions that were made on the mind of an untutored soldier hastened to the court of Edessa or Antioch The highways of the East were crowded with Homoousian and Arian and SemiArian and Eunomian bishops who struggled to outstrip each other in the holy race the apartments of the palace resounded with their clamours and the ears of the prince were assaulted and perhaps astonished by the singular mixture of metaphysical argument and passionate invective  Compare Socrates l iii c and Philostorgius l viii c with Godefroy's Dissertations p  The moderation of Jovian who recommended concord and charity and referred the disputants to the sentence of a future council was interpreted as a symptom of indifference but his attachment to the Nicene

acclamations of the people seated him once more on the archiepiscopal  throne and he wisely accepted or anticipated the invitation of Jovian The venerable figure of Athanasius his calm courage and

de Jovien tom i p he translates the singular and original conferences of the emperor the primate of Egypt and the Arian deputies The Abbé is not satisfied with the coarse pleasantry of Jovian but his partiality for Athanasius assumes in  his  eyes the character of justice  As soon as he had gained the confidence and secured the faith of the Christian emperor he returned in triumph to his diocese

embrace the religious opinions which were supported by the spirit of the times and the zeal and numbers of the most powerful sect  Athanasius apud Theodoret l iv c magnifies the number of the orthodox who composed the whole world  This assertion was verified in the space of thirty or forty years  Under his reign Christianity obtained an easy and lasting victory and as soon as the smile of royal patronage was withdrawn the genius of paganism which had been fondly raised and cherished by the arts of Julian sunk irrecoverably in the dust In many cities the temples were shut or deserted the philosophers who had abused their transient favour thought it prudent to shave their beards and disguise their profession and the Christians rejoiced that they were now in a condition to forgive or to revenge the injuries which they had suffered under the preceding reign  Socrates l iii c Gregory Nazianzen Orat iv p and Libanius Orat Parentalis c p express the  living  sentiments of their respective factions  The consternation of the Pagan world was dispelled by a wise and gracious edict of toleration in which Jovian explicitly declared that although he should severely punish the sacrilegious rites of magic his subjects might exercise with freedom and safety the ceremonies of the ancient worship The memory of this law has been preserved by the orator Themistius who was deputed by the senate of Constantinople  to express their loyal devotion for the new emperor Themistius expatiates on the clemency of the Divine Nature the facility of human error the rights of conscience and the independence of the mind and with some eloquence inculcates the principles of philosophical toleration whose aid Superstition herself in the hour of her distress is not ashamed to implore He justly observes that in the recent changes both religions had been alternately disgraced by the seeming acquisition of worthless proselytes of those votaries of the reigning purple who could pass without a reason and without a blush from the church to the temple and from the altars of Jupiter to the sacred table of the Christians  Themistius Orat v p edit Harduin Paris The Abbé de la Bleterie judiciously remarks Hist de Jovien tom i p that Sozomen has forgot the general toleration and Themistius the establishment of the Catholic religion Each of them turned away from the object which he

to prevent the ambition of some competitor who might occupy the vacant allegiance of Europe But he soon received the grateful intelligence that his authority was acknowledged from the Thracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic ocean By the first letters which he dispatched from the camp of Mesopotamia he had delegated the military command of Gaul and Illyricum to Malarich a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the Franks and to his fatherinlaw count Lucillian who had formerly distinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of Nisibis Malarich had declined an office to which he thought himself unequal and Lucillian was massacred at Rheims in an accidental mutiny of the Batavian cohorts  Compare Ammianus xxv who omits the name of the Batavians with Zosimus l iii p who removes

the  Death of Jovian Feb  consequences of an indigestion occasioned either by the quantity of the wine or the quality of the mushrooms which he had swallowed in the evening According to others he was suffocated in his sleep by the vapour of charcoal which extracted from the walls of the apartment the unwholesome moisture of the fresh plaister  See Ammianus xxv Eutropius x who might likewise be present Jerom tom i p ad Heliodorum Orosius vii Sozomen l vi c Zosimus l iii p and Zonaras tom ii l xiii p We cannot expect a perfect agreement and we shall not discuss minute differences  But the want of a regular enquiry into the death  of a prince whose reign and person were soon forgotten appears to have been the only circumstance which countenanced the malicious whispers of poison and domestic guilt  Ammianus unmindful of his usual candour and good sense compares the death of the harmless Jovian to that of the second Africanus who had excited the fears and resentment of the popular faction  The body of Jovian was sent to Constantinople to be interred with his predecessors and the sad procession was met on the road by his wife Charito the daughter of count Lucillian who still wept the recent death of her father and was hastening to dry her tears in the embraces of an Imperial husband Her disappointment and grief were embittered by the anxiety of maternal tenderness Six weeks before the death of Jovian his infant son had been placed in the curule chair adorned with the title of  Nobilissimus  and the vain ensigns of the consulship Unconscious of his fortune the royal youth who from his grandfather assumed the name of Varronian was reminded only by the jealousy of the government that he was the son of an emperor Sixteen years afterwards he was still alive but he had already been deprived of an eye and his afflicted mother expected every hour that the innocent victim would be torn from her arms to appease with his blood the suspicions of the reigning prince  Chrysostom tom i p edit Montfaucon The Christian orator attempts to comfort a widow by the examples of illustrious misfortunes and observes that of nine emperors including the Caesar Gallus who had reigned in his time only two Constantine and Constantius died a natural death Such vague consolations have never wiped away a single tear    After the death of Jovian the throne of the Roman world remained ten days  Ten days appear scarcely sufficient for the march and election But it may be observed That the generals might command the expeditious use of the public posts for themselves their attendants and messengers That the troops for the ease of the cities marched in many divisions and that the head of the column might arrive at Nice when the rear halted at Ancyra  without a master The ministers and generals still continued  Vacancy of the throne Feb  to meet in council to exercise their respective functions to maintain the public order and peaceably to conduct the army to the city of Nice in Bithynia which was chosen for the place of the election  Ammianus xxvi Zosimus l iii p Philostorgius l viii c and Godefroy Dissertat p Philostorgius who appears to have obtained some curious and authentic intelligence ascribes the choice of Valentinian to the praefect Sallust the mastergeneral Arintheus Dagalaiphus count of the domestics and the Patrician Datianus whose pressing recommendations from Ancyra had a weighty influence in the election  In a solemn assembly of the civil and military powers of the empire the diadem was again unanimously offered to the praefect Sallust He enjoyed the glory of a second refusal and when the virtues of the father were alleged in favour of his son the praefect with the firmness of a disinterested patriot declared to the electors that the feeble age of the one and the unexperienced youth of the other were equally incapable of the laborious duties of government Several candidates were proposed and after weighing the objections of character or situation they were successively rejected but as soon as the name of Valentinian was pronounced the merit of that officer united the suffrages  of the whole assembly and obtained the sincere approbation of Sallust himself Valentinian  Ammianus xxx and the younger Victor have furnished the portraits of Valentinian which naturally precedes and illustrates the history of his reign  was the son of count Gratian a native of Cibalis  Election and character of Valentinian  in Pannonia who from an obscure condition had raised himself by matchless strength and dexterity to the military commands of Africa and Britain from which he retired with an ample fortune and suspicious integrity The rank and services of Gratian contributed however to smooth the first steps of the promotion of his son and afforded him an early opportunity of displaying those solid and useful qualifications which raised his character above the ordinary level of his fellowsoldiers The person of Valentinian was tall graceful and majestic His manly countenance deeply marked with the impression of sense and spirit inspired his friends with awe and his enemies with fear and to second the efforts of his undaunted courage the son of Gratian had inherited the advantages of a strong and healthy constitution By the habits of chastity and temperance which restrain the appetites and invigorate the faculties Valentinian preserved his own and the public esteem The avocations of a military life had diverted his youth from the elegant pursuits of literature he was ignorant of the Greek language and the arts of rhetoric but as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted by timid perplexity he was able as often as the occasion prompted him  to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready elocution The laws of martial discipline were the only laws that he had studied and he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence and inflexible severity with which he discharged and inforced the duties of the camp In the time of Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace by the contempt which he publicly expressed for the reigning religion  At Antioch where he was obliged to attend the emperor to the temple he struck a priest who had presumed to purify him with lustral water Sozomen l vi c Theodoret l iii c Such public defiance might become Valentinian but it could leave no room for the unworthy delation of the philosopher Maximus which supposes some more private offence Zosimus l iv p  and it should seem from his subsequent conduct that the indiscreet and unseasonable freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military spirit rather than of Christian zeal He was pardoned however and still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit  Socrates l iv A previous exile to Melitene or Thebais the first might be possible is interposed by Sozomen l vi c and Philostorgius l vii c with Godefroy's Dissertations p  and in the various events of the Persian war he improved the reputation which he had already acquired on the banks of the Rhine The celerity and success with which he executed an important commission recommended him to the favour of Jovian and to the honourable command of the second  school  or company of Targetteers of the domestic guards In the march from Antioch he had reached his quarters at Ancyra when he was unexpectedly summoned without guilt and without intrigue to assume  in the fortythird year of his age the absolute government of the Roman empire  The invitation of the ministers and generals  He is acknowledged by the army A D Feb  at Nice was of little moment unless it were confirmed by the voice of the army The aged Sallust who had long observed the irregular fluctuations of popular assemblies proposed under pain of death that none of those persons whose rank in the service might excite a party in their favour should appear in public on the day of the inauguration Yet such was the prevalence of ancient superstition that a whole day was voluntarily added to this dangerous interval because it happened to be the intercalation of the Bissextile  Ammianus in a long because unseasonable digression xxvi and Valesius ad locum rashly supposes that he understands an astronomical question of which his readers are ignorant It is treated with more judgment and propriety by Censorinus de Die Natali c and Macrobius Saturnal l i cap The apellation of  Bissextile  which marks the inauspicious year Augustin ad Januarium Epist is derived from the  repetition  of the  sixth  day of the calends of March  At length when the hour was supposed to be propitious Valentinian shewed himself from a lofty tribunal the judicious choice was applauded and the new prince was solemnly invested with the diadem and the purple amidst the acclamations of the troops who were disposed in martial order round the tribunal But when he stretched forth his hand to address the armed multitude a busy whisper was accidentally started in the ranks and insensibly swelled into a loud and imperious clamour that he should name without delay a colleague in the  empire The intrepid calmness of Valentinian obtained silence and commanded respect and he thus addressed the assembly  A few minutes since it was in  your  power fellowsoldiers to have left me in the obscurity of a private station Judging from the testimony of my past life that I deserved to reign you have placed me on the throne It is now  my  duty to consult the safety and interest of the republic The weight of the universe is undoubtedly too great for the hands of a feeble mortal I am conscious of the limits of my abilities and the uncertainty of my life and far from declining I am anxious to solicit the assistance of a worthy colleague But where discord may be fatal the choice of a faithful friend requires mature and serious deliberation That deliberation shall be  my  care Let  your  conduct be dutiful and consistent Retire to your quarters refresh your minds and bodies and expect the accustomed donative on the accession of a new emperor  Valentinian's first speech is full in Ammianus xxvi concise and sententious in Philostorgius l viii c    The astonished troops with a mixture of pride of satisfaction and of terror confessed the voice of their master Their angry clamours subsided into silent reverence and Valentinian encompassed with the eagles of the legions and the various banners of the cavalry and infantry was conducted in warlike pomp to the palace of Nice As he was sensible however of the importance of preventing some rash  declaration of the soldiers he consulted the assembly of the chiefs and their real sentiments were concisely expressed by the generous freedom of Dagalaiphus  Most excellent prince said that officer if you consider only your family you have a brother if you love the republic look round for the most deserving of the Romans  Si tuos amas Imperator optime habes fratrem si Rempublicam quaere quem vestias Ammian xxvi In

submission Valens was now in the thirtysixth year of his age but his abilities had never been exercised in any employment military or civil and his character had not inspired the world with any sanguine expectations He possessed however one quality which recommended him to Valentinian and preserved the domestic peace of the empire a devout and grateful attachment to his benefactor whose

pressing solicitations that he might be permitted to retire from the business of the state were rejected by Valentinian with the most honourable expressions of friendship and esteem But among the favourites of the late emperor there were many who had abused his credulity or superstition and who could no longer hope to be protected either by favour or justice  Eunapius celebrates and exaggerates the sufferings of Maximus p yet he allows that this sophist or magician the guilty favourite of Julian and the personal enemy of Valentinian was dismissed on the payment of a small fine  The greater part of the ministers of the palace and the governors of the provinces were removed from their respective stations yet the eminent merit of some officers was distinguished from the obnoxious crowd and notwithstanding the opposite clamours of zeal and resentment the whole proceedings of this delicate enquiry appear to have been conducted  with a reasonable share of wisdom and moderation  The loose assertions of a general disgrace Zosimus l iv p are detected and refuted by Tillemont tom v p  The festivity of a new reign received a short and suspicious interruption from the sudden illness of the two princes but as soon as their health was restored they left Constantinople in the beginning of the spring In the castle or palace of Mediana only three miles from Naissus they executed the solemn and final division of the Roman empire  Ammianus xxvi  Valentinian bestowed on his brother the rich praefecture of the  East  from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia whilst he reserved for his immediate government the warlike praefectures of  Illyricum Italy  and  Gaul  from the extremity of Greece to the Caledonian rampart and from the rampart of Caledonia to the foot of Mount Atlas The provincial administration remained on its former basis but a double supply of generals and magistrates was required for two councils and two courts the division was made with a just regard to their peculiar merit and situation and seven mastergenerals were soon created either of the cavalry or infantry When this important business had been amicably transacted Valentinian and Valens embraced for the last time The emperor of the West established his temporary residence at Milan and the emperor of the East returned to Constantinople to assume  the dominion of fifty provinces

named him as the successor of a prince who was destitute of natural heirs and a vain rumour was propagated by his friends or his enemies that Julian before the altar of the Moon at Carrhae had privately invested Procopius with the Imperial purple  Ammian xxiii xxvi He mentions the report with much hesitation susurravit obscurior fama nemo enim dicti auctor exstitit verus It serves however to mark that Procopius was a pagan Yet his religion does not appear to have promoted or obstructed his pretensions  He endeavoured by his dutiful and submissive behaviour to disarm the jealousy of Jovian resigned without a contest his military command and retired with his wife and family to cultivate the ample patrimony which he possessed in the province  of Cappadocia These useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the appearance of an officer with a band of soldiers who in the name of his new sovereigns Valentinian and Valens was dispatched to conduct the unfortunate Procopius either to a perpetual prison or an ignominious death His presence of mind procured him a longer respite and a more splendid fate Without presuming to dispute the royal mandate he requested the indulgence of a few moments to embrace his weeping family and while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful entertainment he dexterously escaped to the seacoast of the Euxine from whence he passed over to the country of Bosphorus In that sequestered region he remained many months exposed to the hardships of exile of solitude and of want his melancholy temper brooding over his misfortunes and his mind agitated by the just apprehension that if any accident should discover his name the faithless Barbarians would violate without much scruple the laws of hospitality In a moment of impatience and despair Procopius embarked in a merchant vessel which made sail for Constantinople and boldly aspired to the rank of a sovereign because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a subject At first he lurked in the villages of Bithynia continually changing his habitation and his disguise  One of his retreats was a countryhouse of Eunomius the heretic The master was absent innocent ignorant yet he narrowly escaped a sentence of death and was banished into the remote parts of Mauritania Philostorg l ix c and Godefroy's Dissert p  By degrees he ventured into the capital  trusted his life and fortune to the fidelity of two friends a senator and an eunuch and conceived some hopes of success from the intelligence which he obtained of the actual state of public affairs The body of the people was infected with a spirit of discontent they regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust who had been imprudently dismissed from the praefecture of the East They despised the character of Valens which was rude without vigour and feeble without mildness They dreaded the influence of his fatherinlaw the Patrician Petronius a cruel and rapacious minister who rigorously exacted all the arrears of tribute that might remain unpaid since the reign of the emperor Aurelian The circumstances were propitious to the designs of an usurper The hostile measures of the Persians required the presence of Valens in Syria from the Danube to the Euphrates the troops were in motion and the capital was occasionally filled with the soldiers who passed or repassed the Thracian Bosphorus Two cohorts of Gauls were persuaded to listen to the secret proposals of the conspirators which were recommended by the promise of a liberal donative and as they still revered the memory of Julian they easily consented to support the hereditary claim of his proscribed kinsman At the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths of Anastasia and Procopius clothed in a purple garment more suitable to a player than to a monarch appeared as if he rose from the  dead in the midst of Constantinople The soldiers who were prepared for his reception saluted their trembling prince with shouts of joy and vows of fidelity Their numbers were soon increased by a sturdy band of peasants collected from the adjacent country and Procopius shielded by the arms of his adherents was successively conducted to the tribunal the senate and the palace During the first moments of his tumultuous reign he was astonished and terrified by the gloomy silence of the people who were either ignorant of the cause or apprehensive of the event But his military strength was superior to any actual resistance the malecontents flocked to the standard of rebellion the poor were excited by the hopes and the rich were intimidated by the fear of a general pillage and the obstinate credulity of the multitude was once more deceived by the promised advantages of a revolution The magistrates were seized the prisons and arsenals broke open the gates and the entrance of the harbour were diligently occupied and in a few hours Procopius became the absolute though precarious master of the Imperial city The usurper improved this unexpected success with some degree of courage and dexterity He artfully propagated the rumours and opinions the most favourable to his interest while he deluded the populace by giving audience to the frequent but imaginary ambassadors of distant nations The large bodies of troops stationed in the cities of Thrace and the fortresses of the Lower Danube were gradually involved in the  guilt of rebellion and the Gothic princes consented to supply the sovereign of Constantinople with the formidable strength of several thousand auxiliaries His generals passed the Bosphorus and subdued without an effort the unarmed but wealthy provinces of Bithynia and Asia After an honourable defence the city and island of Cyzicus yielded to his power the renowned legions of the Jovians and Herculians embraced the cause of the usurper whom they were ordered to crush and as the veterans were continually augmented with new levies he soon appeared at the head of

channel of communication was stopt or corrupted he listened with a doubtful anxiety to the rumours which were industriously spread that the defeat and death of Valens had left Procopius sole master of the eastern provinces Valens was not dead but on the news of the rebellion which he received at Caesarea he basely despaired of his life and fortune proposed to negociate with the usurper and discovered his secret inclination to abdicate the Imperial purple The timid monarch was saved from disgrace and ruin by the firmness of his ministers and their abilities soon decided in his  favour the event of the civil war In a season of tranquillity Sallust had resigned without a murmur but as soon as the public safety was attacked he ambitiously solicited the preeminence of toil and danger and the restoration of that virtuous minister to the praefecture of the East was the first step which indicated the repentance of Valens and satisfied the minds of the people The reign of Procopius was apparently supported by powerful armies and obedient provinces But many of the principal officers military as well as civil had been urged either by motives of duty or interest to withdraw themselves from the guilty scene or to watch the moment of betraying and deserting the cause of the usurper Lupicinus advanced by hasty marches to bring the legions of Syria to the aid of Valens

and the folly of mankind sometimes became the instrument and the mask of the most atrocious crimes As soon as the zeal of informers was encouraged by the ministers of Valens and Valentinian they could not refuse to listen to another charge too frequently mingled in the scenes of domestic guilt a charge of a softer and less malignant nature for which the pious though excessive rigour of Constantine had recently decreed the punishment of death  See Heineccius Antiquitat Juris Roman tom ii p c Cod Theodosian l ix tit with Godefroy's Commentary  This deadly and incoherent mixture of treason  and magic of poison and adultery afforded infinite gradations of guilt and innocence of excuse and aggravation which in these proceedings appear to have been confounded by the angry or corrupt passions of the judges They easily discovered that the degree of their industry and discernment was estimated by the Imperial court according to the number of executions that were furnished from their respective tribunals It was not without extreme reluctance that they pronounced a sentence of acquittal but they eagerly admitted such evidence as was stained with perjury or procured by torture to prove the most improbable charges against the most respectable characters The progress of the enquiry continually opened new subjects of criminal prosecution the audacious informer whose falsehood was detected retired with impunity but the wretched victim who discovered his real or pretended accomplices was seldom permitted to receive the price of his infamy From the extremity of Italy and Asia the young and the aged were dragged in chains to the tribunals of Rome and Antioch Senators matrons and philosophers expired in ignominious and cruel tortures The soldiers who were appointed to guard the prisons declared with a murmur of pity and indignation that their numbers were insufficient to oppose the flight or resistance of the multitude of captives The wealthiest families were ruined by fines and confiscations the most innocent citizens trembled for their safety  and we may form some notion of the magnitude of the evil from the extravagant assertion of an ancient writer that in the obnoxious provinces the prisoners the exiles and the fugitives formed the greatest part of the inhabitants  The cruel persecution of Rome and Antioch is described and most probably exaggerated by

who were sacrificed to the cruelty of the first Caesars the art of the historian or the merit of the sufferers excite in our breasts the most lively sensations of terror of admiration and of pity The coarse and undistinguishing pencil of Ammianus has delineated his bloody figures with tedious and disgusting accuracy But as our attention is no longer engaged by the contrast of freedom and servitude of recent greatness and of actual misery we should turn with horror from the frequent executions which disgraced both at Rome and Antioch the reign of the two brothers  Consult the six last books of Ammianus and more particularly the portraits of the two royal brothers xxx xxxi Tillemont has collected tom v p p from all antiquity their virtues and vices  Valens was of a timid  The younger Victor asserts that he was valde timidus yet he behaved as almost every man would do with decent resolution at the  head  of an army The same historian attempts to prove that his anger was harmless Ammianus observes with more candour and judgment incidentia crimina ad contemptam vel laesam principis amplitudinem trahens in sanguinem saeviebat  and Valentinian of a choleric  disposition  Cum esset ad acerbitatem naturae calore propensior poenas per ignes augebat et gladios Ammian xxx See xxvii  An anxious regard to his personal safety was the ruling principle of the administration of Valens In the condition of a subject he had kissed with trembling awe the hand of the oppressor and when he ascended the throne he reasonably expected that the same fears which had subdued his own mind would secure the patient submission of his people The favourites of Valens obtained by the privilege of rapine and confiscation the wealth which his oeconomy would have refused  I have transferred the reproach of avarice from Valens to his servants Avarice more properly belongs to ministers than to kings in whom that passion is commonly extinguished by absolute possession  They urged with persuasive eloquence  that  in all cases of treason suspicion is equivalent to proof  that  the power supposes the intention of mischief  that  the intention is not less criminal than the act and  that  a subject no longer deserves to live if his life may threaten the safety or disturb the repose of his sovereign The judgment of Valentinian was sometimes deceived and his confidence abused but he would have silenced the informers with a contemptuous smile had they presumed to alarm his fortitude by the sound of danger They praised his inflexible love of justice and in the pursuit of justice the emperor was easily tempted to consider clemency as a weakness and passion as a virtue As long as he wrestled with  his equals in the bold competition of an active and ambitious life Valentinian was seldom injured and never insulted with impunity if his prudence was arraigned his spirit was applauded and the proudest and most powerful generals were apprehensive of provoking the resentment of a fearless soldier After he became master of the world he unfortunately forgot that where no resistance can be made no courage can be exerted and instead of consulting the dictates of reason and magnanimity he indulged the furious emotions of his temper at a time when they were disgraceful to himself and fatal to the defenceless objects of his displeasure In the government of his household or of his empire slight or even imaginary offences a hasty word a casual omission an involuntary delay were chastised by a sentence of immediate death The expressions which issued the most readily from the mouth of the emperor of the West were "Strike off his head" "burn him alive" "let him be beaten with clubs till he expires"  He sometimes expressed a sentence of death with a tone of pleasantry  Abi Comes et muta ei caput qui sibi mutari provinciam cupit  A boy who had slipped too hastily a Spartan hound an armourer who had made a polished cuirass that wanted some grains of the legitimate weight c were the victims of his fury  and his most favoured ministers soon understood that by a rash attempt to dispute or suspend the execution of his sanguinary commands they might involve themselves in the guilt and punishment of disobedience The repeated gratification of this savage  justice hardened the mind of Valentinian against pity and remorse and the sallies of passion were confirmed by the habits of cruelty  The innocents of Milan were an agent and three apparitors whom Valentinian condemned for signifying a legal summons Ammianus xxvii strangely supposes that all who had been unjustly executed were worshipped as martyrs by the Christians His impartial silence does not allow us to believe that the great chamberlain Rhodanus was burnt alive for an act of oppression Chron Paschal p  He could behold with calm satisfaction the convulsive agonies of torture and death he reserved his friendship for those faithful servants whose temper was the most congenial to his own The merit of Maximin who had slaughtered the noblest families of Rome was rewarded with the royal approbation and the praefecture of Gaul Two fierce and enormous bears distinguished by the appellations of  Innocence  and  Mica Aurea  could alone deserve to share the favour of Maximin The cages of those trusty guards were always placed near the bedchamber of Valentinian who frequently amused his eyes with the grateful spectacle of seeing them tear and devour the bleeding limbs of the malefactors who were abandoned to their rage Their diet and exercises were carefully inspected by the Roman emperor and when  Innocence  had earned her discharge by a long course of meritorious service the faithful animal was again restored to the freedom of her native woods  Ut bene meritam in sylvas jussit abire  Innoxiam  Ammian xxix and Valesius ad locum    But in the calmer moments of reflection when the mind of Valens was not agitated by fear or that of Valentinian by rage the tyrant resumed  Their laws and government  the sentiments or at least the conduct of the father of his country The dispassionate judgment of the Western emperor could clearly perceive and accurately pursue his own and the public interest and the sovereign of the East who imitated with equal docility the various examples which he received from his elder brother was sometimes guided by the wisdom and virtue of the praefect Sallust Both princes invariably retained in the purple the chaste and temperate simplicity which had adorned their private life and under their reign the pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh They gradually reformed many of the abuses of the times of Constantius judiciously adopted and improved the designs of Julian and his successor and displayed a style and spirit of legislation which might inspire posterity with the most favourable opinion of their character and government It is not from the master of  Innocence  that we should expect the tender regard for the welfare of his subjects which prompted Valentinian to condemn the exposition of newborn infants  See the Code of Justinian l viii tit lii leg Unusquisque sobolem suam nutriat Quod si exponendam

Code l xiii tit iii  De Professoribus et Medicis  and l xiv tit ix  De Studiis liberalibus Urbis Romae  Besides our usual guide Godefroy we may consult Gianone Istoria di Napoli tom i p who has treated the interesting subject with the zeal and curiosity of a man of letters who studies his domestic history  It was his intention that the arts of rhetoric and grammar should be taught in the Greek and Latin languages in the metropolis of every province and as the size and dignity of the school was usually proportioned to the importance of the city the academies of Rome and Constantinople claimed a just and singular preeminence The fragments of the literary edicts of Valentinian imperfectly represent the school of Constantinople which was gradually improved by subsequent regulations That school consisted of thirtyone professors in different branches of learning One philosopher and two lawyers five sophists and ten grammarians for the Greek and three orators and ten grammarians for the Latin tongue besides seven scribes or as they were then styled antiquarians whose laborious pens supplied the public library with fair and correct copies of the elassic writers The rule of conduct which was prescribed to the students is the more curious as it affords the first outlines of the form and discipline of a modern university It was required that they should bring proper certificates  from the magistrates of their native province Their names professions and places of abode were regularly entered in a public register The studious youth were severely prohibited from wasting their time in feasts or in the theatre and the term of their education was limited to the age of twenty The praefect of the city was empowered to chastise the idle and refractory by stripes or expulsion and he was directed to make an annual report to the master of the offices that the knowledge and abilities of the scholars might be usefully applied to the public service The institutions of Valentinian contributed to secure the benefits of peace and plenty and the cities were guarded by the establishment of the  Defensors  Cod Theodos l i tit xi with Godefroy's  Paratitlon  which diligently gleans from the rest of the code  freely elected as the tribunes and advocates of the people to support their rights and to expose their grievances before the tribunals of the civil magistrates or even at the foot of the Imperial throne The finances were diligently administered by two princes who had been so long accustomed to the rigid oeconomy of a private fortune but in the receipt and application of the revenue a discerning eye might observe some difference between the government of the East and of the West Valens was persuaded that royal liberality can be supplied only by public oppression and his ambition never aspired to secure by their actual distress the future strength and prosperity of his people Instead  of increasing the weight of taxes which in the space of fortyyears had been gradually doubled he reduced in the first years of his reign onefourth of the tribute of the East  Three lines from Ammianus xxxi countenance a whole oration of Themistius viii p full of adulation pedantry and commonplace morality The eloquent M Thomas tom i p has amused himself with celebrating the virtues and genius of Themistius who was not unworthy of the age in which he lived  Valentinian appears to have been less attentive and less anxious to relieve the burthens of his people He might reform the abuses of the fiscal administration but he exacted without scruple a very large share of the private property as he was convinced that the revenues which supported the luxury of individuals would be much more advantageously employed for the defence and improvement of the state The subjects of the East who enjoyed the present benefit applauded the indulgence of their prince The solid but less splendid merit of Valentinian was felt and acknowledged by the subsequent generation  Zosimus l iv p Ammian xxx His reformation of costly abuses might entitle him to the praise of in provinciales admodum parcus tributorum ubique molliens sarcinas By some his frugality was styled ayarice Jerom Chron p    But the most honourable circumstance of the  Valentinian maintains the religious toleration A D  character of Valentinian is the firm and temperate impartiality which he uniformly preserved in an age of religious contention His strong sense unenlightened but uncorrupted by study declined with respectful indifference the subtle questions of theological debate The government  of the  Earth  claimed his vigilance and satisfied his ambition and while he remembered that he was the disciple of the church he never forgot that he was the sovereign of the clergy Under the reign of an apostate he had signalized his zeal for the honour of Christianity he allowed to his subjects the privilege which he had assumed for himself and they might accept with gratitude and confidence the general toleration which was granted by a prince addicted to passion but incapable of fear or of disguise  Testes sunt leges a me in exordio Imperii mei datae quibus unicuique quod animo imbibisset colendi libera facultas tributa est Cod Theodos l ix tit xvi leg To this declaration of Valentinian we may add the various testimonies of Ammianus xxx Zosimus l iv p and Sozomen l vi c Baronius would naturally blame such rational toleration Annal Eccles A D No A D No  The Pagans the Jews and all the various sects which acknowledged the divine authority of Christ were protected by the laws from arbitrary power or popular insult nor was any mode of worship prohibited by Valentinian except those secret and criminal practices which abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and disorder The art of magic as it was more cruelly punished was more strictly proscribed but the emperor admitted a formal distinction to protect the ancient methods of divination which were approved by the senate and exercised by the Tuscan haruspices He had condemned with the consent of the most rational Pagans the licence of nocturnal sacrifices but he immeately admitted the petition of Praetextatus proconsul  of Achaia who represented that the life of the Greeks would become dreary and comfortless if they were deprived of the invaluable blessing of the Eleusinian mysteries Philosophy alone can boast and perhaps it is no more than the boast of philosophy that her gentle hand is able to eradicate from the human mind the latent and deadly principle of fanaticism But this truce of twelve years which was enforced by the wise and vigorous government of Valentinian by suspending the repetition of mutual injuries contributed to soften the manners and abate the prejudices of the religious factions  The friend of toleration was unfortunately  Valens professes Arianism and persecutes the catholics A D  placed at a distance from the scene of the fiercest controversies As soon as the Christians of the West had extricated themselves from the snares of the creed of Rimini they happily relapsed into the slumber of orthodoxy and the small remains of the Arian party that still subsisted at Sirmium or Milan might be considered rather as objects of contempt than of resentment But in the provinces of the East from the Euxine to the extremity of Thebais the strength and numbers of the hostile factions were more equally balanced and this equality instead of recommending the counsels of peace served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious war The monks and bishops supported their arguments by invectives and their invectives were sometimes followed by blows Athanasius still reigned at Alexandria the thrones of Constantinople  and Antioch were occupied by Arian prelates and every episcopal vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult The Homoousians were fortified by the reconciliation of fiftynine Macedonian or SemiArian bishops but their secret reluctance to embrace the divinity of the Holy Ghost clouded the splendour of the triumph and the declaration of Valens who in the first years of his reign had imitated the impartial conduct of his brother was an important victory on the side of Arianism The two brothers had passed their private life in the condition of catechumens but the piety of Valens prompted him to solicit the sacrament of baptism before he exposed his person to the dangers of a Gothic war He naturally addressed himself to Eudoxus  Eudoxus was of a mild and timid disposition When he baptized Valens A D he must have been

Imperial city and if the ignorant monarch was instructed by that Arian pastor in the principles of heterodox theology his misfortune rather than his guilt was the inevitable consequence of his erroneous choice Whatever had been the determination of the emperor he must have offended a numerous party of his Christian subjects as the leaders both of the Homoousians and of the Arians believed that if they were not suffered to reign they were most cruelly injured and oppressed  After he had taken this decisive step it was extremely difficult for him to preserve either the virtue or the reputation of impartiality He never aspired like Constantius to the fame of a profound theologian but as he had received with simplicity and respect the tenets of Eudoxus Valens resigned his conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical guides and promoted by the influence of his authority the reunion of the  Athanasian heretics  to the body of the catholic church At first he pitied their blindness by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object of hatred  Gregory Nazianzen Orat xxv p insults the persecuting spirit of the Arians as an infallible symptom of error and heresy  The feeble mind of Valens was always swayed by the persons with whom he familiarly conversed and the exile or imprisonment of a private citizen are the favours the most readily granted in a despotic court Such punishments were frequently inflicted on the leaders of the Homoousian party and the misfortune of fourscore ecclesiastics of Constantinople who perhaps accidentally were burnt on shipboard was imputed to the cruel and premeditated malice of the emperor and his Arian ministers In every contest the catholics if we may anticipate that name were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults and of those of their adversaries In every election the claims of the Arian candidate obtained the preference and if they were opposed by the majority of the  people he was usually supported by the authority of the civil magistrate or even by the terrors of a military force The enemies of Athanasius attempted to disturb the last years of his venerable age and his temporary retreat to his father's sepulchre has been celebrated as a fifth exile But the zeal of a great people who instantly flew to arms intimidated the praefect and the archbishop was permitted to end his life in peace and in glory after a reign of fortyseven years The death of Athanasius was the signal  Death of Athanasius A D May d  of the persecution of Egypt and the Pagan minister of Valens who forcibly seated the worthless Lucius on the archiepiscopal throne purchased the favour of the reigning party by the blood and sufferings of their Christian brethren The free toleration of the heathen and Jewish worship was bitterly lamented as a circumstance which aggravated the misery of the catholics and the guilt of the impious tyrant of the East  This sketch of the ecclesiastical government of Valens is drawn from Socrates l iv Sozomen l vi Theodoret l iv and the immense compilations of Tillemont particularly tom vi viii and ix    The triumph of the orthodox party has left a  Just idea of his persecution  deep stain of persecution on the memory of Valens and the character of a prince who derived his virtues as well as his vices from a feeble understanding and a pusillanimous temper scarcely deserves the labour of an apology Yet candour may discover some reasons to suspect that the ecclesiastical ministers of Valens often exceeded the orders or even the intentions of  their master and that the real measure of facts has been very liberally magnified by the vehement declamation and easy credulity of his antagonists  Dr Jortin Remarks on Ecclesiastical History vol iv p has already conceived and intimated the same suspicion  The silence of Valentinian may suggest a probable argument that the partial severities which were exercised in the name and provinces of his colleague amounted only to some obscure and inconsiderable deviations from the established system of religious toleration and the judicious historian who has praised the equal temper of the elder brother has not thought himself obliged to contrast the tranquillity of the West with the cruel persecution of the East  This reflexion is so obvious and forcible that Orosius l vii c delays the persecution till after the death of Valentinian Socrates on the other hand supposes l iii c that it was appeased by a philosophical oration which Themistius pronounced in the year Orat xii p in Latin only Such contradictions diminish the evidence and reduce the term of the persecution of Valens  Whatever credit may be allowed to vague and distant reports the character or at least the behaviour of Valens may be most distinctly seen in his personal transactions with the eloquent Basil archbishop of Caesarea who had succeeded Athanasius in the management of the Trinitarian cause  Tillemont whom I follow and abridge has extracted Mem Eccles tom viii p the most authentic circumstances from the Panegyrics of the two Gregories the brother and the friend of Basil The letters of Basil himself Dupin Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique tom ii p do not present the image of a very lively persecution  The circumstantial narrative has been composed by the friends and admirers of Basil  and as soon as we have stripped away a thick coat of rhetoric and miracle we shall be astonished by the unexpected mildness of the Arian tyrant who admired the firmness of his character or was apprehensive if he employed violence of a general revolt in the province of Cappadocia The archbishop who asserted with inflexible pride  Basilius Caesariensis episcopus Cappadociae clarus habetur qui multa continentiae et ingenii bona uno superbiae malo perdidit This irreverent passage is perfectly in the style and character of St Jerom It does not appear in Scaliger's edition of his Chronicle but Isaac Vossius found it in some old MSS which had not been reformed by the monks  the truth of his opinions and the dignity of his rank was left in the free possession of his conscience and his throne The emperor devoutly assisted at the solemn service of the cathedral and instead of a sentence of banishment subscribed the donation of a valuable estate for the use of an hospital which Basil had lately founded in the neighbourhood of Caesarea  This noble and charitable foundation almost a new city surpassed in merit if not in greatness the pyramids or the walls of Babylon It was principally intended for the reception of lepers Greg Nazianzen Orat xx p  I am not able to discover that any law such as Theodosius afterwards enacted against the Arians was published by Valens against the Athanasian sectaries and the edict which excited the most violent clamours may not appear so extremely reprehensible The emperor had observed that several of his subjects gratifying their lazy disposition under the pretence of religion had associated themselves with the monks of Egypt and he directed the count of the East  to drag them from their solitude and to compel those deserters of society to accept the fair alternative of renouncing their temporal possessions or of discharging the public duties of men and citizens  Cod Theodos l xii tit i leg Godefroy tom iv

from the liberality of his spiritual daughter every testament contrary to this edict was declared null and void and the illegal donation was confiscated for the use of the treasury By a subsequent regulation it should seem that the same provisions were extended to nuns and bishops and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were rendered incapable of receiving any testamentary gifts and strictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance As the guardian of domestic happiness and virtue Valentinian applied this severe remedy to the growing evil In the capital of the empire the females of noble and opulent houses possessed a very ample share of independent property and many of those devout females had embraced the doctrines of Christianity not only with the cold assent of the understanding but with the warmth of affection and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion They sacrificed the pleasures of dress and luxury and renounced for the praise of chastity the soft endearments of conjugal society Some ecclesiastic  of real or apparent sanctity was chosen to direct their timorous conscience and to amuse the vacant tenderness of their heart and the unbounded confidence which they hastily bestowed was often abused by knaves and enthusiasts who hastened from the extremities of the East to enjoy on a splendid theatre the privileges of the monastic profession By their contempt of the world they insensibly acquired its most desirable advantages the lively attachment perhaps of a young and beautiful woman the delicate plenty of an opulent household and the respectful homage of the slaves the freedmen and the clients of a senatorial family The immense fortunes of the Roman ladies were gradually consumed in lavish alms and expensive pilgrimages and the artful monk who had assigned himself the first or possibly the sole place in the testament of his spiritual daughter still presumed to declare with the smooth face of hypocrisy that  he  was only the instrument of charity and the steward of the poor The lucrative but disgraceful trade  The expressions which I have used are temperate and feeble if compared with the vehement invectives of Jerom tom

of Valentinian was just and necessary and that the Christian priests had deserved to lose a privilege which was still enjoyed by comedians charioteers and the ministers of idols But the wisdom and authority of the legislator are seldom victorious in a contest with the vigilant dexterity of private interest and Jerom or Ambrose might patiently acquiesce in the justice of an ineffectual or salutary law If the ecclesiastics were checked in the pursuit of personal emolument they would exert a more laudable industry to increase the wealth of the church and dignify their covetousness with

been curiously observed by the historian Ammianus who delivers his impartial sense in  these expressive words  The praefecture of Juventius was accompanied with peace and plenty but the tranquillity of his government was soon disturbed by a bloody sedition of the distracted people The ardour of Damasus and Ursinus to seize the episcopal seat surpassed the ordinary measure of human ambition They contended with the rage of party the quarrel was maintained by the wounds and death of their followers and the praefect unable to resist or to appease the tumult was constrained by superior violence

at such a price  This lively picture of the wealth and luxury of the popes in the fourth century becomes the more curious as it represents the intermediate degree between the humble poverty of the apostolic fisherman and the royal state of a temporal prince whose dominions extend from the confines of Naples to the banks of the Po  When the suffrage of the generals and of the  Foreign wars A D  army committed the sceptre of the Roman empire to the hands of Valentinian his reputation in arms his military skill and experience and his rigid attachment to the forms as well as spirit of ancient discipline were the principal motives of their judicious choice The eagerness of the troops who pressed him to nominate his colleague was justified by the dangerous situation of public affairs and Valentinian himself was conscious that the abilities of the most active  mind were unequal to the defence of the distant frontiers of an invaded monarchy As soon as the death of Julian had relieved the Barbarians from the terror of his name the most sanguine hopes of rapine and conquest excited the nations of the East of the North and of the South Their inroads were often vexatious and sometimes  A D  formidable but during the twelve years of the reign of Valentinian his firmness and vigilance protected his own dominions and his powerful genius seemed to inspire and direct the feeble counsels

desultory narrative A separate view of the five great theatres of war I Germany II Britain III Africa IV The East and V The Danube will impress a more distinct image of the military state of the

which they were entitled either from custom or treaty on the accession of a new emperor They expressed and they communicated to their countrymen their strong sense of the  national affront The irascible minds of the chiefs were exasperated by the suspicion of contempt and the martial youth crowded to their standard Before Valentinian could pass the Alps the villages of Gaul were in flames before his general Dagalaiphus could encounter the Alemanni they had secured the captives and the spoil in the forests of Germany In the beginning  A D January  of the ensuing year the military force of the whole nation in deep and solid columns broke through the barrier of the Rhine during the severity of a northern winter Two Roman counts were defeated and mortally wounded and the standard of the Heruli and Batavians fell into the hands of the conquerors who displayed with insulting shouts and menaces the trophy of their victory The standard was recovered but the Batavians had not redeemed the shame of their disgrace and flight in the eyes of their severe judge It was the opinion of Valentinian that his soldiers must learn to fear their commander before they could cease to fear the enemy The troops were solemnly assembled and the trembling Batavians were inclosed within the circle of the Imperial army Valentinian then ascended his tribunal and as if he disdained to punish cowardice with death he inflicted a stain of indelible ignominy on the officers whose misconduct and pusillanimity were found to be the first occasion of the defeat The Batavians were degraded from their rank stripped of their arms and condemned to be sold for slaves to the  highest bidder At this tremendous sentence the troops fell prostrate on the ground deprecated the indignation of their sovereign and protested that if he would indulge them in another trial they would approve themselves not unworthy of the name of Romans and of his soldiers Valentinian with affected reluctance yielded to their entreaties the Batavians resumed their arms and with their arms the invincible resolution of wiping away their disgrace in the blood of the Alemanni  Ammian xxvii Zosimus l iv p The disgrace of the Batavians is suppressed by the contemporary soldier from a regard for military honour which could not affect a Greek rhetorician of the succeeding age  The principal command was declined by Dagalaiphus and that experienced general who had represented perhaps with too much prudence the extreme difficulties of the undertaking had the mortification before the end of the campaign of seeing his rival Jovinus convert those difficulties into a decisive advantage over the scattered forces of the Barbarians At  Their defeat  the head of a welldisciplined army of cavalry infantry and light troops Jovinus advanced with cautious and rapid steps to Scarponna  See d'Anville Notice de l'ancienne Gaule p The name of the Moselle which is not specified by Ammianus is clearly understood by Mascou Hist of the ancient Germans vii  in the territory of Metz where he surprised a large division of the Alemanni before they had time to run to their arms and flushed his soldiers with the confidence of an easy and bloodless victory Another division or rather army of the  enemy after the cruel and wanton devastation of the adjacent country reposed themselves on the shady banks of the Moselle Jovinus who had viewed the ground with the eye of a general made his silent approach through a deep and woody vale till he could distinctly perceive the indolent security of the Germans Some were bathing their huge limbs in the river others were combing their long and flaxen hair others again were swallowing large draughts of rich and delicious wine On a sudden they heard the sound of the Roman trumpet they saw the enemy in their camp Astonishment produced disorder disorder was followed by flight and dismay and the confused multitude of the bravest warriors was pierced by the swords and javelins of the legionaries and auxiliaries The fugitives escaped to the third and most considerable camp in the Catalaunian plains near Chalons in Champagne the straggling detachments were hastily recalled to their standard and the Barbarian chiefs alarmed and admonished by the fate of their companions prepared to encounter in a decisive battle the victorious forces of the lieutenant of Valentinian The bloody and obstinate conflict lasted a whole summer's day with equal valour and with alternate success The Romans at length prevailed with the loss of about twelve hundred men Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain four thousand were wounded and the brave Jovinus after chacing the flying remnant of their host as far as the banks  of the Rhine returned to Paris to receive the applause of his sovereign and the ensigns of the  July  consulship for the ensuing year  The battles are described by Ammianus xxvii and by Zosimus l iv p who supposes Valentinian to have been present  The triumph of the Romans was indeed sullied by their treatment of the captive king whom they hung on a gibbet without the knowledge of their indignant general This digraceful act of cruelty which might be imputed to the fury of the troops was followed by the deliberate murder of Withicab the son of Vadomair a German prince of a weak and sickly constitution but of a daring and formidable spirit The domestic assassin was instigated and protected by the Romans  Studio solicitante nostrorum occubuit Ammian xxvii  and the violation of the laws of humanity and justice betrayed their secret apprehension of the weakness of the declining empire The use of the dagger is seldom adopted in public councils as long as they retain any confidence in the power of the sword  While the Alemanni appeared to be humbled by  Valentinian passes and fortisies the Rhine A D  their recent calamities the pride of Valentinian was mortified by the unexpected surprisal of Moguntiacum or Mentz the principal city of the Upper Germany In the unsuspicious moment of a Christian festival Rando a bold and artful chieftain who had long meditated his attempt suddenly passed the Rhine entered the defenceless town and retired with a multitude of  captives of either sex Valentinian resolved to execute severe vengeance on the whole body of the nation Count Sebastian with the bands of Italy and Illyricum was ordered to invade their country most probably on the side of Rhaetia The emperor in person accompanied by his son Gratian passed the Rhine at the head of a formidable army which was supported on both flanks by Jovinus and Severus the two mastersgeneral of the cavalry and infantry of the West The Alemanni unable to prevent the devastation of their villages fixed their camp on a lofty and almost inaccessible mountain in the modern duchy of Wirtemberg and resolutely expected the approach of the Romans The life of Valentinian was exposed to imminent danger by the intrepid curiosity with which he persisted to explore some secret and unguarded path A troop of Barbarians suddenly rose from their ambuscade and the emperor who vigorously spurred his horse down a steep and slippery descent was obliged to leave behind him his armourbearer and his helmit magnificently enriched with gold and precious stones At the signal of the general assault the Roman troops encompassed and ascended the mountain of Solicinium on three different sides Every step which they gained increased their ardour and abated the resistance of the enemy and after their united forces had occupied the summit of the hill they impetuously urged the Barbarians down the northern descent where count Sebastian was posted to intercept their retreat After this signal victory  Valentinian returned to his winterquarters at Treves where he indulged the public joy by the exhibition of splendid and triumphal games  The expedition of Valentinian is related by Ammianus xxvii and celebrated by Ausonius Mosell c who foolishly supposes that the Romans were ignorant of the sources of the Danube  But the wise monarch instead of aspiring to the conquest of Germany confined his attention to the important and laborious defence of the Gallic frontier against an enemy whose strength was renewed by a stream of daring volunteers which incessantly flowed from the most distant tribes of the North  Immanis enim natio jam inde ab incunabulis primis varietate casuum imminuta ita saepius adolescit ut fuisse longis saeculis aestimetur intacta Ammian xxviii The Count de Buat Hist des Peuples de l'Europe tom vi p ascribes the fecundity of the Alemanni to their easy adoption of strangers  The banks of the Rhine from its source to the streights of the ocean were closely planted with strong castles and convenient towers new works and new arms were invented by the ingenuity of a prince who was skilled in the mechanical arts and his numerous levies of Roman and Barbarian youth were severely trained in all the exercises of war The progress of the work which was sometimes opposed by modest representations and sometimes by hostile attempts secured the tranquillity of Gaul during the nine subsequent years of the administration of Valentinian  Ammian xxviii Zosimus l iv p The younger Victor mentions the mechanical genius of Valentinian nova arma meditari fingere terrâ seu limo simulacra    That

Bellicosos et pubis immensae viribus assluentes et ideo metuendos sinitimis universis Ammian xxviii  whose obscure name insensibly swelled into a powerful kingdom and has finally settled on a flourishing province The most remarkable circumstance in the ancient manners of the Burgundians appears to have been the difference of their civil and ecclesiastical constitution The appellation of  Hendinos  was given to the king or general and the title of  Sinistus  to the highpriest of the nation The person of the priest was sacred and his dignity perpetual but the temporal government was held by a very precarious tenure If the events of war accused the courage or conduct of the king he was immediately deposed and the injustice of his subjects made him responsible for the fertility of the earth and the regularity of the seasons which seemed to fall more properly within the sacerdotal department  I am always apt to suspect historians and travellers of improving extraordinary facts

emperor and their fabulous descent from the Roman soldiers who had formerly been left to garrison the fortresses of Drusus was admitted with mutual credulity as it was conducive to mutual interest  Jam inde temporibus priscis sobolem se esse Romanam Burgundii sciunt and the vague tradition gradually assumed a more regular form Oros l vii c It is annihilated by the decisive authority of Pliny who composed the history of Drusus and served in Germany Plin Secund Epist iii within sixty years after the death of that hero  Germanorum genera  quinque Vindili quorum pars  Burgundiones  c Hist Natur iv  An army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soon appeared on the banks of the Rhine and impatiently required the support and subsidies which Valentinian had promised but they were amused with excuses and delays till at length after a fruitless expectation they were compelled to retire The arms and fortifications of the Gallic frontier checked the fury of their just resentment and their massacre of the captives served to embitter the hereditary feud of the Burgundians and the Alemanni The inconstancy of a wise prince may perhaps be explained by some alteration of circumstances and perhaps it was the original design of Valentinian to intimidate rather than to destroy as the balance of power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation  of either of the German nations Among the princes of the Alemanni Macrianus who with a Roman name had assumed the arts of a soldier and a statesman deserved his hatred and esteem The emperor himself with a light and unincumbered band condescended to pass the Rhine marched fifty miles into the country and would infallibly have seized the object of his pursuit if his judicious measures had not been defeated by the impatience of the troops Macrianus was afterwards admitted to the honour of a personal conference with the emperor and the favours which he received fixed him till the hour of his death a steady and sincere friend of the republic  The wars and negociations relative to the Burgundians and Alemanni are distinctly related by Ammianus Marcellinus xxviii xxix xxx Orosius l vii c and the Chronicles of Jerom and Cassiodorius fix some dates and add some circumstances    The land was covered by the fortifications of  The Saxons  Valentinian but the sea coast of Gaul and Britain was exposed to the depredations

the  Saxons  and the Cimbri with six obscure tribes who were united as early as the sixth century under the national appellation  anes  See Cluver German Antiq l iii c  This contracted territory the

laws and their colonies and who so long defended the liberty of the North against the arms of Charlemagne  M d'Anville Etablissement des Etats de l'Europe c p has marked the extensive limits of the Saxony of Charlemagne  The solution of this difficulty is easily derived from the similar manners and loose constitution of the tribes of Germany which were blended with each other by the slightest accidents of war or friendship The situation of the native Saxons disposed them to embrace the hazardous professions of fishermen and pirates and the success of their first adventures would naturally excite the emulation of their bravest countrymen who were impatient of the gloomy solitude of their woods and mountains Every tide might float down the Elbe whole fleets of canoes filled with hardy and intrepid associates who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect of the ocean and to taste the wealth and luxury of unknown worlds It should seem probable however that the most numerous auxiliaries of the Saxons were furnished by the nations who dwelt along the shores of the Baltic They possessed arms and ships the art of navigation and the habits of naval war but the difficulty of issuing through the northern columns of Hercules  The fleet of Drusus had failed in their attempt to pass or even to approach the  Sound  styled from an obvious resemblance the columns of Hercules and the naval enterprize was never resumed Tacit de Moribus German c The knowledge which the Romans acquired of the naval powers of the Baltic c was obtained by their land journies in search of amber  which during several months of the year are obstructed with ice confined their skill and courage within the limits of a spacious lake The rumour of the successful armaments which sailed from the mouth of the Elbe would soon provoke them to cross the narrow isthmus of Sleswig and to launch their vessels on the great sea The various troops of pirates and adventurers who fought under the same standard were insensibly united in a permanent society at first of rapine and afterward of government A military confederation was gradually moulded into a national body by the gentle operation of marriage and consanguinity and the adjacent tribes who solicited the alliance accepted the name and laws of the Saxons If the fact were not established by the most unquestionable evidence we should appear to abuse the credulity of our readers by the description of the vessels in which the Saxon pirates ventured to sport in the waves of the German Ocean the British Channel and the Bay of Biscay The keel of their large flatbottomed boats was framed of light timber but the sides and upper works consisted only of wicker with a covering of strong hides  Qum et Aremoricus piratam  Saxona  tractus  Sperabat cui

used by the natives of Britain Comment de Bell Civil i and Guichardt Nouveaux Memoires Militaires tom ii p The British vessels would now astonish the genius of Caesar    In the course of their slow and distant navigations they must always have been exposed to the danger and very frequently to the misfortune of shipwreck and the naval annals of the Saxons were undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the losses which they sustained on the coasts of Britain and Gaul But the daring spirit of the pirates braved the perils both of the sea and of the shore their skill was confirmed by the habits of enterprize the meanest of their mariners was alike capable of handling an oar of rearing a sail or of conducting a vessel and the Saxons rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest which concealed their design and dispersed the fleets of the enemy  The best original account of the Saxon pirates may be found in Sidonius Apollinaris l viii epist p edit Sirmond and the best commentary in the Abbé du Bos Hist Critique de la Monarchie Francoise c tom i l i c p See likewise p  After they had acquired an accurate knowledge of the maritime provinces of the West they extended the scene of their depredations and the most sequestered places had no reason to presume on their security The Saxon boats drew so little water that they could easily proceed fourscore or an hundred miles up the great rivers their weight was so inconsiderable that they were transported on waggons from one river to another and the pirates who had entered the mouth of the Seine or of the  Rhine might descend with the rapid stream of the Rhone into the Mediterranean Under the reign of Valentinian the maritime provinces of Gaul were afflicted by the Saxons a military count was stationed for the defence of the seacoast or Armorican limit and that officer who found his strength or his abilities unequal to the task implored the assistance of Severus mastergeneral of the infantry The Saxons surrounded and outnumbered were forced to relinquish their spoil and to yield a select band of their tall and robust youth to serve in the Imperial armies They stipulated only a safe and honourable retreat and the condition was readily granted by the Roman general who meditated an act of perfidy  Ammian xxviii justifies this breach of faith to pirates and robbers and Orosius l vii c more clearly expresses their real guilt virtute atque agilitate terribiles  imprudent as it was inhuman while a Saxon remained alive and in arms to revenge the fate of his countrymen The premature eagerness of the infantry who were secretly posted in a deep valley betrayed the ambuscade and they would perhaps have fallen the victims of their own treachery if a large body of cuirassiers alarmed by the noise of the combat had not hastily advanced to extricate their companions and to overwhelm the undaunted valour of the Saxons Some of the prisoners were saved from the edge of the sword to shed their blood in the amphitheatre and the orator Symmachus complains that twentynine of those desperate savages by strangling themselves  with their own hands had disappointed the amusement of the public Yet the polite and philosophic citizens of Rome were impressed with the deepest horror when they were informed that the Saxons consecrated to the gods the tythe of their  human  spoil and that they ascertained by

Dissertations on the Origin Antiquities c of the Caledonians by Dr John Macpherson London in to and Introduction to the History of Great Britain and Ireland by James Macpherson  Esq  London in to third edit Dr Macpherson was a minister in the Isle of Sky and it is a circumstance honourable for the present age that a work replete with erudition and criticism should have been composed in the most remote of the Hebrides  who have since experienced a very different fortune The power and almost the memory of the Picts have been extinguished by their successful rivals and the Scots after maintaining for ages the dignity of an independent kingdom have multiplied by an equal and voluntary union the honours of the English name The hand of nature had contributed to mark the ancient distinction of the Scots and Picts The  former were the men of the hills and the latter those of the plain The eastern coast of Caledonia may be considered as a level and fertile country which even in a rude state of tillage was capable of producing a considerable quantity of corn and the epithet of  cruitnich  or wheateaters expressed the contempt or envy of the carnivorous highlander The cultivation of the earth might introduce a more accurate separation of property and the habits of a sedentary life but the love of arms and rapine was still the ruling passion of the Picts and their warriors who stripped themselves for a day of battle were distinguished in the eyes of the Romans by the strange fashion of painting their naked bodies with gaudy colours and fantastic figures The western part of Caledonia irregularly rises into wild and barren hills which scarcely repay the toil of the husbandman and are most profitably used for the pasture of cattle The highlanders were condemned to the occupations of shepherds and hunters and as they seldom were fixed to any permanent habitation they acquired the expressive name of SCOTS which in the Celtic tongue is said to be equivalent to that of  wanderers  or  vagrants  The inhabitants of a barren land were urged to seek a fresh supply of food in the waters The deep lakes and bays which intersect their country are plentifully stored with fish and they gradually ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the ocean The vicinity of the Hebrides so profusely scattered along the  western coast of Scotland tempted their curiosity and improved their skill and they acquired by slow degrees the art or rather the habit of managing their boats in a tempestuous sea and of steering their nocturnal course by the light of the wellknown stars The two bold headlands of Caledonia almost touch the shores of a spacious island which obtained from its luxuriant vegetation the epithet of  Green  and has preserved with a slight alteration the name of Erin or Ierne or Ireland It is  probable  that in some remote period of antiquity the fertile plains of Ulster received a colony of hungry Scots and that the strangers of the North who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions spread their conquests over the savage and unwarlike natives of a solitary island It is  certain  that in the declining age of the Roman empire Caledonia Ireland and the Isle of Man were inhabited by the Scots and that the kindred tribes who were often associated in military enterprize were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual fortunes They long cherished the lively tradition of their common name and origin and the missionaries of the Isle of Saints who diffused the light of Christianity over North Britain established the vain opinion that their Irish countrymen were the natural as well as spiritual fathers of the Scottish race The loose and obscure tradition has been preserved by the venerable Bede who scattered some rays of light over the darkness of the eighth century On this  slight foundation an huge superstructure of fable was gradually reared by the bards and the monks two orders of men who equally abused the privilege of fiction The Scottish nation with mistaken pride adopted their Irish genealogy and the annals of a long line of imaginary kings have been adorned by the fancy of Boethius and the classic elegance of Buchanan  The Irish descent of the Scots has been revived in the last moments of its decay and strenuously supported by the Rev Mr Whitaker Hist of Manchester vol

 Restoration of Britain by Theodosius A D  alarming tidings to the ears of Valentinian and the emperor was soon informed that the two military commanders of the province had been surprised and cut off by the Barbarians Severus  count of the domestics was hastily dispatched and as suddenly recalled by the court of Treves The representations of Jovinus served only to indicate the greatness of the evil and after a long and serious consultation the defence or rather the recovery of Britain was entrusted to the abilities of the brave Theodosius The exploits of that general the father of a line of emperors have been celebrated with peculiar complacency by the writers of the age but his real merit deserved their applause and his nomination was received by the army and province as a sure presage of approaching victory He seized the favourable moment of navigation and securely landed the numerous and veteran bands of the Heruli and Batavians the Jovians and the Victors In his march from Sandwich to London Theodosius defeated several parties of the Barbarians released a multitude of captives and after distributing to his soldiers a small portion of the spoil established the fame of disinterested justice by the restitution of the remainder to the rightful proprietors The citizens of London who had almost despaired of their safety threw open their gates and as soon as Theodosius had obtained from the court of Treves the important aid of a military lieutenant and a civil governor he executed with wisdom and vigour the laborious task of the deliverance of Britain The vagrant soldiers were recalled to their standard an edict of amnesty dispelled the public apprehensions and his cheerful example alleviated the  rigour of martial discipline The scattered and desultory warfare of the Barbarians who infested the land and sea deprived him of the glory of a signal victory but the prudent spirit and consummate art of the Roman general were displayed in the operations of two campaigns  A D and  which successively rescued every part of the province from the hands of a cruel and rapacious enemy The splendour of the cities and the security of the fortifications were diligently restored by the paternal care of Theodosius who with a strong hand confined the trembling Caledonians to the northern angle of the island and perpetuated by the name and settlement of the new province of  Valentia  the glories of the reign of Valentinian  Ammianus has concisely represented xx xxvi xxvii xxviii the whole series of the British war  The voice of poetry and panegyric may add perhaps with some degree of truth that the unknown regions of Thule were stained with the blood of the Picts that the oars of Theodosius dashed the waves of the Hyperborean ocean and that the

The prince who refuses to be the judge  III AFRICA Tyranny of Romanus A D c  instructs his people to consider him as the accomplice of his ministers The military command of Africa had been long exercised by Count Romanus and his abilities were not inadequate to his station but as sordid interest was the sole motive of his conduct he acted on most occasions as if he had been the enemy of the province and the friend of the Barbarians of the desert The three flourishing cities of Oea Leptis and Sabrata which under the name of Tripoli had long constituted a foederal union  Ammianus frequently mentions their concilium annuum legitimum c Leptis and Sabrata are long since ruined but the city of Oea the native country of Apuleius still flourishes under the provincial denomination of

invasion several of their most honourable citizens were surprised and massacred the villages and even the suburbs were pillaged  and the vines and fruittrees of that rich territory were extirpated by the malicious savages of Getulia The unhappy provincials implored the protection of Romanus but they soon found that their military governor was not less cruel and rapacious than the Barbarians As they were incapable of furnishing the four thousand camels and the exorbitant present which he required before he would march to the assistance of Tripoli his demand was equivalent to a refusal and he might justly be accused as the author of the public calamity In the annual assembly of the three cities they nominated two deputies to lay at the feet of Valentinian the customary offering of a gold victory and to accompany this tribute of duty rather than of gratitude with their humble complaint that they were ruined by the enemy and betrayed by their governor If the severity of Valentinian had been rightly directed it would have fallen on the guilty head of Romanus But the Count long exercised in the arts of corruption had dispatched a swift and trusty messenger to secure the venal friendship of Remigius master of the offices The wisdom of the Imperial council was deceived by artifice and their honest indignation was cooled by delay At length when the repetition of complaint had been justified by the repetition of public misfortunes the notary Palladius was sent from the court of Treves to examine the state of Africa and the conduct of Romanus The rigid impartiality of Palladius was easily disarmed he  was tempted to reserve for himself a part of the public treasure which he brought with him for the payment of the troops and from the moment that he was conscious of his own guilt he could no longer refuse to attest the innocence and merit of the Count The charge of the Tripolitans was declared to be false and frivolous and Palladius himself was sent back from Treves to Africa with a special commission to discover and prosecute the authors of this impious conspiracy against the representatives of the sovereign His enquiries were managed with so much dexterity and success that he compelled the citizens of Leptis who had sustained a recent siege of eight days to contradict the truth of their own decrees and to censure the behaviour of their own deputies A bloody sentence was pronounced without hesitation by the rash and headstrong cruelty of Valentinian The president of Tripoli who had presumed to pity the distress of the province was publicly executed at Utica four distinguished citizens were put to death as the accomplices of the imaginary fraud and the tongues of two others were cut out by the express order of the emperor Romanus elated by impunity and irritated by resistance was still continued in the military command till the Africans were provoked by his avarice to join the rebellious standard of Firmus the Moor

Moorish princes who acknowledged the supremacy of Rome But as he  Revolt of Firmus A D  left either by his wives or concubines a very numerous posterity the wealthy inheritance was eagerly disputed and Zamma one of his sons was slain in a domestic quarrel by his brother Firmus The implacable zeal with which Romanus prosecuted the legal revenge of this murder could be ascribed only to a motive of avarice or personal hatred but on this occasion his claims were just his influence was weighty and Firmus clearly understood that he must either present his neck to the executioner or appeal from the sentence of the Imperial consistory to his sword and to the people  The chronology of Ammianus is loose and obscure and Orosius l vii c p edit Havercamp seems to place the revolt of Firmus after the deaths of Valentinian and Valens Tillemont Hist des Emp tom v p endeavours to pick his way The patient and surefooted mule of the Alps may be trusted in the most slippery paths  He was received as the deliverer of his country and as soon as it appeared that Romanus was formidable only to a submissive province the tyrant of Africa became the object of universal contempt The ruin of Caesarea which was plundered and burnt by the licentious Barbarians convinced the refractory cities of the danger of resistance the power of Firmus was established at least in the provinces of Mauritania and Numidia and it seemed to be his only doubt whether he should assume the diadem of a Moorish king or the purple of a Roman emperor But the imprudent  and unhappy Africans soon discovered that in this rash insurrection they had not sufficiently consulted their own strength or the abilities of their leader Before he could procure any certain intelligence that the emperor of the West had fixed the choice of a general or that a fleet of transports was collected at the mouth of the Rhone he was suddenly informed that the great  Theodosius recovers Africa A D  Theodosius with a small band of veterans had landed near Igilgilis or Gigeri on the African coast and the timid usurper sunk under the ascendant of virtue and military genius Though Firmus possessed arms and treasures his despair of victory immediately reduced him to the use of those arts which in the same country and in a similar situation had formerly been practised by the crafty Jugurtha He attempted to deceive by an apparent submission the vigilance of the Roman general to seduce the fidelity of his troops and to protract the duration of the war by successively engaging the independent tribes of Africa to espouse his quarrel or to protect his flight Theodosius imitated the example and obtained the success of his predecessor Metellus When Firmus in the character of a suppliant accused his own rashness and humbly solicited the clemency of the emperor the lieutenant of Valentinian received and dismissed him with a friendly embrace but he diligently required the useful and substantial pledges of a sincere repentance nor could he be persuaded by the assurances of peace to suspend for an  instant the operations of an active war A dark conspiracy was detected by the penetration of Theodosius and he satisfied without much reluctance the public indignation which he had secretly excited Several of the guilty accomplices of Firmus were abandoned according to ancient custom to the tumult of a military execution many more by the amputation of both their hands continued to exhibit an instructive spectacle of horror the hatred of the rebels was accompanied with fear and the fear of the Roman soldiers was mingled with respectful admiration Amidst the boundless plains of Getulia and the innumerable vallies of Mount Atlas it was impossible to prevent the escape of Firmus and if the usurper could have tired the patience of his antagonist he would have secured his person in the depth of some remote solitude and expected the hopes of a future revolution He was subdued by the perseverance of Theodosius who had formed an inflexible determination that the war should end only by the death of the tyrant and that every nation of Africa which presumed to support his cause should be involved in his ruin At the head of a small body of troops which seldom exceeded three thousand five hundred men the Roman general advanced with a steady prudence devoid of rashness or of fear into the heart of a country where he was sometimes attacked by armies of twenty thousand Moors The boldness of his charge dismayed the irregular Barbarians they were disconcerted  by his seasonable and orderly retreats they were continually baffled by the unknown resources of the military art and they felt and confessed the just superiority which was assumed by the leader of a civilised nation When Theodosius entered the extensive dominions of Igmazen king of the Isaflenses the haughty savage required in words of defiance his name and the object of his expedition  I am replied the stern and disdainful count I am the general of Valentinian the lord of the world who has sent me hither to pursue and punish a desperate robber Deliver him instantly into my hands and be assured that if thou dost not obey the commands of my invincible sovereign thou and the people over whom thou reignest shall be utterly extirpated  As soon as Igmazen was satisfied that his enemy had strength and resolution to execute the fatal menace he consented to purchase a necessary peace by the sacrifice of a guilty fugitive The guards that were placed to secure the person of Firmus deprived him of the hopes of escape and the Moorish tyrant after wine had extinguished the sense of danger disappointed the insulting triumph of the Romans by strangling himself in the night His dead body the only present which Igmazen could offer to the conqueror was carelesly thrown upon a camel and Theodosius leading back his victorious troops to Sitisi was saluted by the warmest acclamations of joy and loyalty  Ammian xxix The text of this long chapter fifteen quarto pages is broken and corrupted and the narrative is perplexed by the want of chronological and geographical landmarks    Africa had

encouraged him to challenge his legal judges to obtain repeated delays for the purpose of procuring a crowd of friendly witnesses and finally to cover his guilty conduct by the additional guilt of fraud and forgery About the same time the restorer of Britain and Africa on a vague suspicion that his name and services were superior to the rank of a subject was ignominiously beheaded at Carthage Valentinian no longer reigned and the death of Theodosius as well as the impunity of Romanus may justly be imputed to the arts of the ministers who abused the confidence and deceived the inexperienced

we should have traced with eager  curiosity the distinct and domestic footsteps of his march But the tedious enumeration of the unknown and uninteresting tribes of Africa may be reduced to the general remark that they were all of the swarthy race of the Moors that they inhabited the back settlements of the Mauritanian and Numidian provinces the country as they have since been termed by the Arabs of dates and of locusts  Leo Africanus in the Viaggi di Ramusio tom i fol has traced a curious picture of the people and the country which are more minutely described in the Afrique de Marmol tom iii p  and that as the Roman power declined in Africa the boundary of civilised manners and cultivated land was insensibly contracted Beyond the utmost limits of the Moors the vast and inhospitable desert of the South extends above a thousand miles to the banks of the Niger The ancients who had a very faint and imperfect knowledge of the great peninsula of Africa were sometimes tempted to believe that the torrid zone must ever remain destitute of inhabitants  This uninhabitable zone was gradually reduced by the improvements of ancient geography from fortyfive to twentyfour or even sixteen degrees of latitude See a learned and judicious note of Dr Robertson Hist of America vol i p  and they sometimes amused their fancy by filling the vacant space with headless men or rather monsters  Intra si

original and decisive xxvii Moses of Chorene l iii c p and c p and Procopius de Bell Persico l i c p edit Louvre have been consulted but those historians who confound distinct facts repeat the same events and introduce strange stories must be used with diffidence and caution  Sapor entered the Armenian  territories at the head of a formidable host of cuirassiers of archers and of mercenary foot but it was the invariable practice of Sapor to mix war and negociation and to consider falsehood and perjury as the most powerful instruments of regal policy He affected to praise the prudent and moderate conduct of the king of Armenia and the unsuspicious Tiranus was persuaded by the repeated assurances of insidious friendship to deliver his person into the hands of a faithless and cruel enemy In the midst of a splendid entertainment he was bound in chains of silver as an honour due to the blood of the Arsacides and after a short confinement in the Tower of Oblivion at Ecbatana he was released from the miseries of life either by his own dagger or by that of an assassin The kingdom of Armenia was reduced to the state of a Persian province the administration was shared between a distinguished satrap and a favourite eunuch and Sapor marched without delay to subdue the martial spirit of the Iberians Sauromaces who reigned in that country by the permission of the emperors was expelled by a superior force and as an insult on the majesty of Rome the King of kings placed a diadem on the head of his abject vassal Aspacuras The city of Artogerassa  Perhaps Artagera or Ardis

of Armenia which presumed  to resist the effort of his arms The treasure deposited in that strong fortress tempted the avarice of Sapor but the danger of Olympias the wife or widow of the Armenian king excited the public compassion and animated the desperate valour of her subjects and soldiers The Persians were surprised and repulsed under the walls of Artogerassa by a bold and wellconcerted sally of the besieged But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and increased the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhausted the strength of the walls yielded to the assault and the proud conqueror after wasting the rebellious city with fire and sword led away captive an unfortunate queen who in a more auspicious hour had been the destined bride of the son of Constantine  Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p proves from chronology that Olympias must have been the mother of Para  Yet if Sapor already triumphed in the easy conquest of two dependent kingdoms he soon felt that a country is unsubdued as long as the minds of the people are actuated by an hostile and contumacious spirit The satraps whom he was obliged to trust embraced the first opportunity of regaining the affection of their countrymen and of signalising their immortal hatred to the Persian name Since the conversion of the Armenians and Iberians those nations considered the Christians as the favourites and the Magians as the adversaries of the Supreme Being the influence of the clergy over a superstitious people was uniformly exerted  in the cause of Rome and as long as the successors of Constantine disputed with those of Artaxerxes the sovereignty of the intermediate provinces the religious connexion always threw a decisive advantage into the scale of the empire A numerous and active party acknowledged Para the son of Tiranus as the lawful sovereign of Armenia and his title to the throne was deeply rooted in the hereditary succession of five hundred years By the unanimous consent of the Iberians the country was equally divided between the rival princes and Aspacuras who owed his diadem to the choice of Sapor was obliged to declare that his regard for his children who were detained as hostages by the tyrant was the only consideration which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of Persia The emperor Valens who respected the obligations of the treaty and who was apprehensive of involving the East in a dangerous war ventured with slow and cautious measures to support the Roman party in the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia Twelve legions established the authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus The Euphrates was protected by the valour of Arintheus A powerful army under the command of count Trajan and of Vadomair king of the Alemanni fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia But they were strictly enjoined not to commit the first hostilities which might be understood as a breach of the treaty and such was the implicit obedience of the Roman  general that they retreated with exemplary patience under a shower of Persian arrows till they had clearly acquired a just title to an honourable and legitimate victory Yet these appearances of war insensibly subsided in a vain and tedious negociation The contending parties supported their claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy and ambition and it should seem that the original treaty was expressed in very obscure terms since they were reduced to the necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the partial testimony of the generals of the two nations who had assisted at the negociations  Ammianus xxvii xxix xxx has described the events without the dates of the Persian war Moses of Chorene Hist Armen l iii c p c p c p affords some additional facts but it is extremely difficult to separate truth from fable  The invasion of the Goths and Huns which soon afterwards shook the foundations of the Roman empire exposed the provinces of Asia to the arms of Sapor But the

persuasion of his mother Olympias had escaped through the Persian host that besieged Artogerassa and implored the protection of the emperor of the East By his timid councils Para was alternately supported and recalled and restored and betrayed The hopes of the Armenians were sometimes raised by the presence of their natural sovereign and the ministers of Valens were satisfied that they preserved the integrity of the public saith if their vassal was not suffered to assume the diadem and title of King But they soon repented of their own rashness They were confounded by the reproaches and threats of the Persian monarch They found reason to distrust the cruel and inconstant temper of Para himself who  sacrificed to the slightest suspicions the lives of his most faithful servants and held a secret and disgraceful correspondence with the assassin of his father and the enemy of his country Under the specious pretence of consulting with the emperor on the subject of their common interest Para was persuaded to descend from the mountains of Armenia where his party was in arms and to trust his independence and safety to the discretion of a perfidious court The king of Armenia for such he appeared in his own eyes and in those of his nation was received with due honours by the governors of the provinces through which he passed but when he arrived at Tarsus in Cilicia his progress was stopped under various pretences his motions were watched with respectful vigilance and he gradually discovered that he was a prisoner in the hands of the Romans Para suppressed his indignation dissembled his fears and after secretly preparing his escape mounted on horseback with three hundred of his faithful followers The officer stationed at the door of his apartment immediately communicated his flight to the consular of Cilicia who overtook him in the suburbs and endeavoured without success to dissuade him from prosecuting his rash and dangerous design A legion was ordered to pursue the royal fugitive but the pursuit of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light cavalry and upon the first cloud of arrows that was discharged into the air they retreated with precipitation to  the gates of Tarsus After an incessant march of two days and two nights Para and his Armenians reached the banks of the Euphrates but the passage of the river which they were obliged to swim was attended with some delay and some loss The country was alarmed and the two roads which were only separated by an interval of three miles had been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback under the command of a count and a tribune Para must have yielded to superior force if the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger and the means of escape A dark and almost impervious path securely conveyed the Armenian troop through the thicket and Para had left behind him the count and the tribune while they patiently expected his approach along the public highways They returned to the Imperial court to excuse their want of diligence or success and seriously alleged that the king of Armenia who was a skilful magician had transformed himself and his followers and passed before their eyes under a borrowed shape After his return to his native kingdom Para still continued to profess himself the friend and ally of the Romans but the Romans had injured him too deeply ever to forgive and the secret sentence of his death was signed in the council of Valens The execution of the bloody deed was committed to the subtle prudence of Count Trajan and he had the merit of insinuating himself into the confidence of the credulous prince that he might find an opportunity  of stabbing him to the heart Para was invited to a Roman banquet which had been prepared with all the pomp and sensuality of the East the hall resounded with cheerful music and the company was already heated with wine when the count retired for an instant drew his sword and gave the signal of the murder A robust and desperate Barbarian instantly rushed on the king of Armenia and though he bravely defended his life with the first weapon that chance offered to his hand the table of the Imperial  A D  general was stained with the royal blood of a guest and an ally Such were the weak and wicked maxims of the Roman administration that to attain a doubtful

of the Gothic hero instead of being supported by the vigour of youth was displayed with glory and success in the extreme period of human life between the age of fourscore and one hundred and ten years The independent tribes were persuaded or compelled to acknowledge the king of the Ostrogoths as the sovereign of the Gothic nation the chiefs of the Visigoths or Thervingi renounced the royal title and assumed the more humble appellation of  Judges  and among those judges Athanaric Fritigern and Alavivus were the most illustrious by their personal merit as well as by their vicinity to the Roman provinces These domestic conquests which increased the military power of Hermanric enlarged his ambitious designs He invaded the adjacent countries of the North and twelve considerable nations whose

which the king was slain the remains of that warlike tribe became an useful accession to the camp of Hermanric He then marched against the Venedi unskilled in the use of arms and formidable only by their numbers which filled the wide extent of the plains of modern Poland The victorious Goths who were not inferior in numbers prevailed in the contest by the decisive advantages of exercise and discipline After the submission of the Venedi the conqueror advanced without resistance as far as the confines of the Aestii  The edition of Grotius Jornandes p exhibits the name of  Aestri  But

the scarcity of iron obliged the Aestian warriours to content themselves with wooden clubs and the reduction of that wealthy country is ascribed to the prudence rather than to the arms of Hermanric His dominions which extended from the Danube to the Baltic included the native seats and the recent acquisitions of the Goths and he reigned over the greatest part of Germany and Scythia with the authority of a conqueror and sometimes with the cruelty of a tyrant But he reigned over a  part of the globe incapable of perpetuating and adorning the glory of its heroes The name of Hermanric is

who had been raised to the throne by a popular election inspired the Goths with bolder hopes and while they agitated some design of marching their consederate force under the national standard  Valens docetur relationibus Ducum gentem Gothorum eâ tempestate intactam ideoque saevissimam conspirantem in unum ad pervadendam parari collimitia Thraciarum Ammian xxvi  they were easily tempted to embrace the party of Procopius and to foment by their dangerous aid the civil discord of the Romans The public treaty might stipulate no more than ten thousand auxiliaries but the design was so zealously adopted by the chiefs of the Visigoths that the army which passed the Danube amounted to  the number of thirty thousand men  M de Buat Hist des Peuples de l'Europe tom vi p has curiously ascertained the real number of these auxiliaries The of Ammianus and the of Zosimus were only the first divisions of the Gothic army  They marched with the proud confidence that their invincible valour would decide the fate of the Roman empire and the provinces of Thrace groaned under the weight of the Barbarians who displayed the insolence of masters and the licentiousness of enemies But the intemperance which gratified their appetites retarded their progress and before the Goths could receive any certain intelligence of the defeat and death of Procopius they perceived by the hostile state of the country that the civil and military powers were resumed by his successful rival A chain of posts and fortifications skilfully disposed by Valens or the generals of Valens resisted their march prevented their retreat and intercepted their subsistence The fierceness of the Barbarians was tamed and suspended by hunger they indignantly threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror who offered them food and chains the numerous captives were distributed in all the cities of the East and the provincials who were soon familiarized with their savage appearance ventured by degrees to measure their own strength with these formidable adversaries whose name had so long been the object of their terror The king of Scythia and Hermanric alone could deserve so lofty a title was grieved and exasperated by this national calamity His ambassadors  loudly complained at the court of Valens of the infraction of the ancient and solemn alliance which had so long subsisted between the Romans and the Goths They alleged that they had fulfilled the duty of allies by assisting the kinsman and successor of the emperor Julian they required the immediate restitution of the noble captives and they urged a very singular claim that the Gothic generals marching in arms and in hostile array were entitled to the sacred character and privileges of ambassadors The decent but peremptory refusal of these extravagant demands was signified to the Barbarians by Victor mastergeneral of the cavalry who expressed with force and dignity the just complaints of the Emperor of the East  The march and subsequent negociation are described in the Fragments of Eunapius Excerpt Legat p edit Louvre The provincials who afterwards became familiar with the Barbarians found that their strength was more apparent than real They were tall of stature but their legs were clumsy and their shoulders were narrow  The negociation was interrupted and the manly exhortations of Valentinian encouraged his timid brother to vindicate the insulted majesty of the empire  Valens enim ut consulto placuerat fratri cujus regebatur arbitrio arma concussit in Gothos ratione justâ permotus Ammianus xxvii then proceeds to describe not the country of the Goths but the peaceful and obedient province of Thrace which was not affected by the war    The splendour and magnitude of this Gothic  Hostilities and peace A D  war are celebrated by a contemporary historian  Eunapius in Excerpt Legat p The Greek sophist must have considered as  one  and the  same  war the whole series of Gothic history till the victories and peace of Theodosius    but the events scarcely deserve the attention of posterity except as the preliminary steps of the approaching decline and fall of the empire Instead of leading the nations of Germany and Scythia to the banks of the Danube or even to the gates of Constantinople the aged monarch of the Goths resigned to the brave Athanaric the danger and glory of a defensive war against an enemy who wielded with a feeble hand the powers of a mighty state A bridge of boats was established upon the Danube the presence of Valens animated his troops and his ignorance of the art of war was compensated by personal bravery and a wise deference to the advice of Victor and Arintheus his mastersgeneral of the cavalry and infantry The operations of the campaign were conducted by their skill and experience but they found it impossible to drive the Visigoths from their strong posts in the mountains and the devastation of the plains obliged the Romans themselves to repass the Danube on the approach of winter The incessant rains which swelled the waters of the river produced a tacit suspension of arms and confined the emperor Valens during the whole course of the ensuing summer to his camp of Marcianapolis The third year of the war was more savourable to the Romans and more pernicious to the Goths The interruption of trade deprived  the Barbarians of the objects of luxury which they already confounded with the necessaries of life and the desolation of a very extensive tract of country threatened them with the horrors of famine Athanaric was provoked or compelled to risk a battle which he lost in the plains and the pursuit was rendered more bloody by the cruel precaution of the victorious generals who had promised a large reward for the head of every Goth that was brought into the Imperial camp The submission of the Barbarians appeased the resentment of Valens and his council the emperor listened with satisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remonstrance of the senate of Constantinople which assumed for the first time a share in the public deliberations and the same generals Victor and Arintheus who had successfully directed the conduct of the war were empowered to regulate the conditions of peace The freedom of trade which the Goths had hitherto enjoyed was restricted to two cities on the Danube the rashness of their leaders was severely punished by the suppression of their pensions and subsidies and the exception which was stipulated in favour of Athanaric alone was more advantageous than honourable to the Judge of the Visigoths Athanaric who on this occasion appears to have consulted his private interest without expecting the orders of his sovereign supported his own dignity and that of his tribe in the personal interview which was proposed by the ministers of Valens He persisted in his declaration that it was impossible for him without  incurring the guilt of perjury ever to set his foot on the territory of the empire and it is more than probable that his regard for the sanctity of an oath was confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of Roman treachery The Danube which separated the dominions of the two independent nations was chosen for the scene of the conference The Emperor of the East and the Judge of the Visigoths accompanied by an equal number of armed followers advanced in their respective barges to the middle of the stream After the ratification of the treaty and the delivery of hostages Valens returned in triumph to Constantinople and the Goths remained in a state of tranquillity about six years till they were violently impelled against the Roman empire by an innumerable host of Scythians who appeared to issue from the frozen regions of the North  The Gothic war is described by Ammianus xxvii Zosimus l iv p and Themistius Orat x p The orator Themistius was sent from the senate of Constantinople to congratulate the victorious emperor and his servile eloquence compares Valens  on  the Danube to

the Quadi and Sarmatians A D  to his brother the command of the Lower Danube reserved for his immediate care the defence of the Rhaetian and Illyrian provinces which spread so many hundred miles along the greatest of the European rivers The active policy of Valentinian was continually employed in adding new fortifications to the security of the frontier  but the abuse of this policy provoked the just resentment of the Barbarians The Quadi complained that the ground for an intended fortress had been marked out on their territories and their complaints were urged with so much reason and moderation that Equitius mastergeneral of Illyricum consented to suspend the prosecution of the work till he should be more clearly informed of the will of his sovereign This fair occasion of injuring a rival and of advancing the fortune of his son was eagerly embraced by the inhuman Maximin the praefect or rather tyrant of Gaul The passions of Valentinian were impatient of controul and he credulously listened to the assurances of his favourite that if the government of Valeria and the direction of the work were entrusted to the zeal of his son Marcellinus the emperor should no longer be importuned with the audacious remonstrances of the Barbarians The subjects of Rome and the natives of Germany were insulted by the arrogance of a young and worthless minister who considered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his superior merit He affected however to receive the modest application of Gabinius king of the Quadi with some attention and regard but this artful civility concealed a dark and bloody design and the credulous prince was persuaded to accept the pressing invitation of Marcellinus I am at a loss how to vary the narrative of similar crimes or how to relate that in the course of the same year but in remote parts of the empire the inhospitable table  of two Imperial generals was stained with the royal blood of two guests and allies inhumanly murdered by their order and in their presence The fate of Gabinius and of Para was the same but the cruel death of their sovereign was resented in a very different manner by the servile temper of the Armenians and the free and daring spirit of the Germans The Quadi were much declined from that formidable power which in the time of Marcus Antoninus had spread terror to the gates of Rome But they still possessed arms and courage their courage was animated by despair and they obtained the usual reinforcement of the cavalry of their Sarmatian allies So improvident was the assassin Marcellinus that he chose the moment when the bravest veterans had been drawn away to suppress the revolt of Firmus and the whole province was exposed with a very feeble defence to the rage of the exasperated Barbarians They invaded Pannonia in the season of harvest unmercifully destroyed every object of plunder which they could not easily transport and either disregarded or demolished the empty fortifications The princess Constantia the daughter of the emperor Constantius and the granddaughter of the great Constantine very narrowly escaped That royal maid who had innocently supported the revolt of Procopius was now the destined wife of the heir of the Western empire She traversed the peaceful province with a splendid and unarmed train Her person was saved from  danger and the republic from disgrace by the active zeal of Messala governor of the provinces As soon as he was informed that the village where she stopped only to dine was almost encompassed by the Barbarians he hastily placed her in his own chariot and drove full speed till he reached the gates of Sirmium which were at the distance of six and twenty miles Even Sirmium might not have been secure if the Quadi and Sarmatians had diligently advanced during the general consternation of the magistrates and people Their delay allowed Probus the Praetorian praefect sufficient time to recover his own spirits and to revive the courage of the citizens He skilfully directed their strenuous efforts to repair and strengthen the decayed fortifications and procured the seasonable and effectual assistance of a company of archers to protect the capital of the Illyrian provinces Disappointed in their attempts against the walls of Sirmium the indignant Barbarians turned their arms against the mastergeneral of the frontier to whom they unjustly attributed the murder of their king Equitius could bring into the field no more than two legions but they contained the veteran strength of the Maesian and Pannonian bands The obstinacy with which they disputed the vain honours of rank and precedency was the cause of their destruction and while they acted with separate forces and divided councils they were surprised and slaughtered by the active vigour of the Sarmatian horse The success of this invasion  provoked the emulation of the bordering tribes and the province of Maesia would infallibly have been lost if young Theodosius the duke or military commander of the frontier had not signalised in the defeat of the public enemy an intrepid genius worthy of his illustrious father and of his future greatness  Ammianus xxix and Zosimus l iv p carefully mark the origin and progress of the Quadic and Sarmatian war    The mind of Valentinian who then resided at  The expedition  Treves was deeply affected by the calamities of Illyricum but the lateness of the season suspended the execution of his designs till the ensuing spring He marched in person with a  A D  considerable part of the forces of Gaul from the banks of the Moselle and to the suppliant ambassadors of the Sarmatians who met him on the way he returned a doubtful answer that as soon as he reached the scene of action he should examine and pronounce When he arrived at Sirmium he gave audience to the deputies of the Illyrian provinces who loudly congratulated their own felicity under the auspicious government of Probus his Praetorian praefect  Ammianus xxx who acknowledges the merit has censured with becoming asperity the oppressive administration of Petronius Probus When Jerom translated and continued the Chronicle of Eusebius A D See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xii p he expressed the truth or at least the public opinion of his country in the following words  Probus P P Illyrici iniquissimis tributorum exactionibus

of Count Equitius with less propriety but without much injustice has been substituted in the text  Valentinian  who was flattered by these demonstrations of their loyalty and gratitude imprudently asked the deputy of Epirus a Cynic philosopher of intrepid sincerity  Julian Orat vi p represents his friend Iphicles as a man of virtue and merit who had made himself ridiculous and unhappy by adopting the extravagant dress and manners of the Cynics  whether he was freely sent by the wishes of the province  With tears and groans am I sent replied Iphicles by a reluctant people  The emperor paused but the impunity of his ministers established the pernicious maxim that they might oppress his subjects without injuring his service A strict inquiry into their conduct would have relieved the public discontent The severe condemnation of the murder of Gabinius was the only measure which could restore the confidence of the Germans and vindicate the honour of the Roman name But the haughty monarch was incapable of the magnanimity which dares to acknowledge a fault He forgot the provocation remembered only the injury and advanced into the country of the Quadi with an insatiate thirst of blood and revenge The extreme devastation and promiscuous massacre of a savage war were justified in the eyes of the emperor and perhaps in those of the world by the cruel equity of retaliation  Ammian xxx Jerom who exaggerates the misfortune of Valentinian refuses him even this last consolation of revenge Genitali vastato solo et  inuitam  patriam derelinquens tom i p  and such was the discipline of  the Romans and the consternation of the enemy that Valentinian repassed the Danube without the loss of a single man As he had resolved to complete the destruction of the Quadi by a second campaign he fixed his winterquarters at Bregetio on the Danube near the Hungarian city of Presburgh While the operations of war were suspended by the severity of the weather the Quadi made an humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror and at the earnest persuasion of Equitius their ambassadors were introduced into the Imperial council They approached the throne with bended bodies and dejected countenances and without daring to complain of the murder of their king they affirmed with solemn oaths that the late invasion was the crime of some irregular robbers which the public council of the nation condemned and abhorred The answer of the emperor left them but little to hope from his clemency or compassion He reviled in the most intemperate language their baseness their ingratitude their insolenceHis eyes his voice his colour his gestures expressed the violence of his ungoverned fury and while his whole frame was agitated with convulsive passion a large bloodvessel suddenly burst in his body and Valentinian fell speechless into the arms of his attendants Their pious care immediately concealed his situation from the crowd but in a few minutes the emperor of the West expired in an agony of pain  and death of Valentinian  retaining his senses till the last and struggling  without success to declare his intentions to the generals and ministers who surrounded the royal couch Valentinian was about fiftyfour years of  A D Nov th  age and he wanted only one hundred days to accomplish the twelve years of his reign  See on the death of Valentinian Ammianus xxx Zosimus l iv p Victor in Epitom Socrates l iv c and Jerom in Chron p and tom i p ad Heliodor There is much variety of circumstances among them and Ammianus is so eloquent that he writes nonsense    The polygamy of Valentinian is seriously attested  The emperors Gratian and Valentinian II  by an ecclesiastical historian  Socrates l iv c is the only original witness of this foolish story so repugnant to the laws and manners of the Romans that it scarcely deserves the formal and elaborate dissertation of M Bonamy Mem de l'Academie tom xxx p Yet I would preserve the natural circumstance of the bath instead of following Zosimus who represents Justina as an old woman the widow of Magnentius    The empress Severa I relate the fable admitted into her familiar society the lovely Justina the daughter of an Italian governor her admiration of those naked charms which she had often seen in the bath was expressed with such lavish and imprudent praise that the emperor was tempted to introduce a second wife into his bed and his public edict extended to all the subjects of the empire the same domestic privilege which he had assumed for himself  But we may be assured from the evidence of reason as well as history that the two marriages of Valentinian with Severa and with Justina were  successively  contracted and that he used the ancient permission of divorce which was still allowed by the laws though it  was condemned by the church Severa was the mother of Gratian who seemed to unite every claim which could entitle him to the undoubted succession of the Western empire He was the eldest son of a monarch whose glorious reign had confirmed the free and honourable choice of his fellowsoldiers Before he had attained the ninth year of his age the royal youth received from the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem with the title of Augustus the election was solemnly ratified by the consent and applause of the armies of Gaul  Ammianus xxvii describes the form of this military election and  august  investiture Valentinian does not appear to have consulted or even informed the senate of Rome  and the name of Gratian was added to the names of Valentinian and Valens in all the legal transactions of the Roman government By his marriage with the granddaughter of Constantine the son of Valentinian acquired all the hereditary rights of the Flavian family which in a series of three Imperial generations were sanctified by time religion and the reverence of the people At the death of his father the royal youth was in the seventeenth year of his age and his virtues already justified the favourable opinion of the army and people But Gratian resided without apprehension in the palace of Treves whilst at the distance of many hundred miles Valentinian suddenly expired in the camp of Bregetio The passions which had been so long suppressed by the presence of a master immediately revived in the Imperial council and the ambitious design  of reigning in the name of an infant was artfully executed by Mellobaudes and Equitius who commanded the attachment of the Illyrian and Italian bands They contrived the most honourable pretences to remove the popular leaders and the troops of Gaul who might have asserted the claims of the lawful successor they suggested the necessity of extinguishing the hopes of foreign and domestic enemies by a bold and decisive measure The empress Justina who had been left in a palace about one hundred miles from Bregetio was respectfully invited to appear in the camp with the son of the deceased emperor On the sixth day after the death of Valentinian the infant prince of the same name who was only four years old was shewn in the arms of his mother to the legions and solemnly invested by military acclamation with the titles and ensigns of supreme power The impending dangers of a civil war were seasonably prevented by the wise and moderate conduct of the emperor Gratian He cheerfully accepted the choice of the army declared that he should always consider the son of Justina as a brother not as a rival and advised the empress with her son Valentinian to fix their residence at Milan in the fair and peaceful province of Italy while he assumed the more arduous command of the countries beyond the Alps Gratian dissembled his resentment till he could safely punish or disgrace the authors of the conspiracy and though he uniformly behaved with tenderness and regard to his infant colleague he gradually confounded  in the administration of the Western empire the office of a guardian with the authority of a sovereign The government of the Roman world was exercised in the united names of Valens and his two nephews but the feeble Emperor of the East who succeeded to the rank of his elder brother never obtained any weight or influence in the councils of the West  Ammianus xxx Zosimus l iv p Tillemont has proved Hist des Empereurs tom v p that Gratian

various appearance of vallies and mountains which had never since the formation of the globe been exposed to the sun But the tide soon returned with the weight of an immense and irresistible deluge which was severely felt on the coasts of Sicily of Dalmatia of Greece and of Egypt large boats were transported and lodged on the roofs of houses or  at the distance of two miles from the shore the people with their habitations were swept away by the waters and the city of Alexandria annually commemorated the fatal day on which fifty thousand persons had lost their lives in the inundation This calamity the report of which was magnified from one province to another astonished and terrified the subjects of Rome and their affrighted imagination enlarged the real extent of a momentary evil They recollected the preceding earthquakes which had subverted the cities of Palestine and Bithynia they considered these alarming strokes as the prelude only of still more dreadful calamities and their fearful vanity was disposed to confound the symptoms of a declining empire and a sinking world  The earthquakes and inundations are variously described by Libanius Orat de ulciscendâ Juliani nece c x

remarkable event to the particular will of the Deity the alterations of nature were connected by an invisible chain with the moral and metaphysical opinions of the human mind and the most sagacious divines could distinguish according to the colour of their respective prejudices that the establishment of heresy tended to produce an earthquake or that a deluge was  the inevitable consequence of the progress of sin and error Without presuming to discuss the truth or propriety of these lofty speculations the historian may content himself with an observation which seems to be justified by experience that man has much more to fear from the passions of his fellowcreatures than from the convulsions of the elements  Dicaearchus the Peripatetic composed a formal treatise to prove this obvious truth which is not the most honourable to the human species Cicero de Officiis ii  The mischievous effects of an earthquake or deluge a hurricane or the eruption of a volcano bear a very inconsiderable proportion to the ordinary calamities of war as they are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe who amuse their own leisure and exercise the courage of their subjects in the practice of the military art But the laws and manners of modern nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished soldier and the peaceful citizen had seldom reason to complain that his life or even his fortune is exposed to the rage of war In the disastrous period of the fall of the Roman empire which may justly be dated from the reign of Valens the happiness and security of each individual were personally attacked and the arts and labours of ages were rudely defaced by the Barbarians of Scythia and Germany The invasion of the  The Huns and Goths A D  Huns precipitated on the provinces of the West the Gothic nation which advanced in less than forty years from the Danube to the Atlantic and opened a way by the success of their arms  to the inroads of so many hostile tribes more savage than themselves The original principle of motion was concealed in the remote countries of the North and the curious observation of the pastoral life of the Scythians  The original

Wesseling has marked the gradual progress of the  name  and nation  or Tartars  The  Tatars  or Tartars were a primitive tribe the rivals and at length the subjects of the Moguls In the victorious armies of Zingis Khan and his successors the Tartars formed the vanguard and the name which first reached the ears of foreigners was applied to the whole nation Freret in the Hist de l'Academie tom xviii p In speaking of all or any of the northern shepherds of Europe or Asia I indifferently use the appellations of  Scythians  or  Tartars  will illustrate the latent cause of these destructive emigrations  The different characters that mark the civilised  The pastoral manners of the Scythians or Tartars  nations of the globe may be ascribed to the use and the abuse of reason which so variously shapes and so artificially composes the manners and opinions of an European or a Chinese But the operation of instinct is more sure and simple than that of reason it is much easier to ascertain the appetites of a quadruped than the speculations of a philosopher and the savage tribes of mankind as they approach nearer to the condition of animals preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to each other The uniform stability of their manners is the natural consequence of the imperfection of their faculties Reduced to a similar situation their  wants their desires their enjoyments still continue the same and the influence of food or climate which in a more improved state of society is suspended or subdued by so many moral causes most powerfully contributes to form and to maintain the national character of Barbarians In every age the immense plains of Scythia or Tartary have been inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds whose indolence refuses to cultivate the earth and whose restless spirit disdains the confinement of a sedentary life In every age the Scythians and Tartars have been renowned for their invincible courage and rapid conquests The thrones of Asia have been repeatedly overturned by the shepherds of the North and their arms have spread terror and devastation over the most fertile and warlike countries of Europe  Imperium Asiae  ter  quaesivere ipsi perpetuo ab alieno Imperio aut intacti aut invicti mansere Since the time of Justin ii they have multiplied this account Voltaire in a few words tom x p Hist Generale c has abridged the Tartar conquests  Oft o'er the trembling nations from afar  Has Scythia breath'd the living cloud of war  On this occasion as well as on many others the sober historian is forcibly awakened from a pleasing vision and is compelled with some reluctance to confess that the pastoral manners which have been adorned with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence are much better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life To illustrate this observation I shall now proceed to consider a nation of shepherds and of warriors  in the three important articles of I Their diet II Their habitation and III Their exercises The narratives of antiquity are justified by the experience of modern times  The fourth book of Herodotus affords a curious though imperfect portrait of the Scythians Among the moderns who describe the uniform scene the Khan of Khowaresm Abulghazi Bahadur expresses his native feelings and his Genealogical History of the  Tatars  has been copiously illustrated by the French and English editors Carpin Ascelin and Rubruquis in the Hist des Voyages tom vii represent the Moguls of the fourteenth century To these guides I have added

ordinary and wholesome food of a civilised people can be obtained only by the patient toil of the husbandman Some of the happy savages who dwell between the tropics are plentifully nourished by the liberality of nature but in the climates of the North a nation of shepherds is reduced to their flocks and herds The skilful practitioners of the medical art will determine if they are able to determine how far the temper of the human mind may be affected by the use of animal or of vegetable food and whether the common association of carnivorous and cruel deserves to be considered in any  other light than that of an innocent perhaps a salutary prejudice of humanity  Il est certain que les grands mangeurs de viande sont en general cruels et feroces plus que les autres hommes Cette observation est de touts les lieux et de touts les tems la barbare Angloise est connue c Emile de Rousseau tom i p Whatever we may think of the general observation  we  shall not easily allow the truth of his example The goodnatured complaints of Plutarch and the pathetic lamentations of Ovid seduce our reason by exciting our sensibility  Yet if it be true that the sentiment of compassion is imperceptibly weakened by the sight and practice of domestic cruelty we may observe that the horrid objects which are disguised by the arts of European refinement are exhibited in their naked and most disgusting simplicity in the tent of a Tartarian shepherd The ox or the sheep are slaughtered by the same hand from which they were accustomed to receive their daily food and the bleeding limbs are served with very little preparation on the table of their unfeeling murderer In the military profession and especially in the conduct of a numerous army the exclusive use of animal food appears to be productive of the most solid advantages Corn is a bulky and perishable commodity and the large magazines which are indispensably necessary for the subsistence of our troops must be slowly transported by the labour of men or horses But the flocks and herds which accompany the march of the Tartars afford a sure and encreasing supply of flesh and milk in the far greater part of the uncultivated waste the vegetation of the grass is quick and luxuriant and there are few places  so extremely barren that the hardy cattle of the North cannot find some tolerable pasture The supply is multiplied and prolonged by the undistinguishing appetite and patient abstinence of the Tartars They indifferently feed on the flesh of those animals that have been killed for the table or have died of disease Horseflesh which in every age and country has been proscribed by the civilised nations of Europe and Asia they devour with peculiar greediness and this singular taste facilitates the success of their military operations The active cavalry of Scythia is always followed in their most distant and rapid incursions by an adequate number of spare horses who may be occasionally used either to redouble the speed or to satisfy the hunger of the Barbarians Many are the resources of courage and poverty When the forage round a camp of Tartars is almost consumed they slaughter the greatest part of their cattle and preserve the flesh either smoked or dried in the sun On the sudden emergency of a hasty march they provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of little balls of cheese or rather of hard curd which they occasionally dissolve in water and this unsubstantial diet will support for many days the life and even the spirits of the patient warrior But this extraordinary abstinence which the Stoic would approve and the hermit might envy is commonly succeeded by the most voracious indulgence of appetite The wines of a happier climate are the most grateful present  or the most valuable commodity that can be offered to the Tartars and the only example of their industry seems to consist in the art of extracting from mare's milk a fermented liquor which possesses a very strong power of intoxication Like the animals of prey the savages both of the old and new world experience the alternate vicissitudes of famine and plenty and their stomach is inured to sustain without much inconvenience the opposite extremes of hunger and of intemperance  II In the ages of rustic and martial simplicity  Habitations  a people of soldiers and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an extensive and cultivated country and some time must elapse before the warlike youth of Greece or Italy could be assembled under the same standard either to defend their own confines or to invade the territories of the adjacent tribes The progress of manufactures and commerce insensibly collects a large multitude within the walls of a city but these citizens are no longer soldiers and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil society corrupt the habits of the military life The pastoral manners of the Scythians seem to unite the different advantages of simplicity and refinement The individuals of the same tribe are constantly assembled but they are assembled in a camp and the native spirit of these dauntless shepherds is animated by mutual support and emulation The houses of the Tartars are no more than small tents of an oval form which afford a cold and  dirty habitation for the promiscuous youth of both sexes The palaces of the rich consist of wooden huts of such a size that they may be conveniently fixed on large waggons and drawn by a team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen The flocks and herds after grazing all day in the adjacent pastures retire on the approach of night within the protection of the camp The necessity of preventing the most mischievous confusion in such a perpetual concourse of men and animals must gradually introduce in the distribution the order and the guard of the encampment the rudiments of the military art As soon as the forage of a certain district is consumed the tribe or rather army of shepherds makes a regular march to some fresh pastures and thus acquires in the ordinary occupations of the pastoral lise the practical knowledge of one of the most important and difficult operations of war The choice of stations is regulated by the difference of the seasons in the summer the Tartars advance towards the North and pitch their tents on the banks of a river or at least in the neighbourhood of a running stream But in the winter they return to the South and shelter their camp behind some convenient eminence against the winds which are chilled in their passage over the bleak and icy regions of Siberia These manners are admirably adapted to diffuse among the wandering tribes the spirit of emigration and conquest The connection between the people and their territory is of so frail a texture that it  may be broken by the slightest accident The camp and not the soil is the native country of the genuine Tartar Within the precincts of that camp his family his companions his property are always included and in the most distant marches he is still surrounded by the objects which are dear or valuable or familiar in his eyes The thirst of rapine the fear or the resentment of injury the impatience of servitude have in every age been sufficient causes to urge the tribes of Scythia boldly to advance into some unknown countries where they might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence or a less formidable enemy The revolutions of the North have frequently determined the fate of the South and in the conflict of hostile nations the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove and been driven from the confines of China to those of Germany  These Tartar emigrations have been discovered by M de Guignes Histoire des Huns tom i ii a skilful and laborious interpreter of the Chinese language who has thus laid open new and important scenes in the history of mankind  These great emigrations which have been sometimes executed with almost incredible diligence were rendered more easy by the peculiar nature of the climate It is well known that the cold of Tartary is much more severe than in the midst of the temperate zone might reasonably be expected this uncommon rigour is attributed to the height of the plains which rise especially towards the East more than half a mile above the level of the sea and to the quantity of saltpetre with which the soil is deeply  impregnated  A plain in the Chinese Tartary only eighty leagues from the great wall was found by the missionaries to be three thousand geometrical paces above the level of the sea Montesquieu who has used and abused the relations of travellers deduces the revolutions of Asia from this important circumstance that heat and cold weakness and strength touch each other without any temperate zone Esprit des Loix l xvii c  In the winterseason the broad and rapid rivers that discharge their waters into the Euxine the Caspian or the Icy Sea are strongly frozen the fields are covered with a bed of snow and the fugitive or victorious tribes may securely traverse with their families their waggons and their cattle the smooth and hard surface of an immense plain  III The pastoral life compared with the labours  Exercises  of agriculture and manufactures is undoubtedly a life of idleness and as the most honourable shepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their captives the domestic management of the cattle their own leisure is seldom disturbed by any servile and assiduous cares But this leisure instead of being devoted to the soft enjoyments of love and harmony is usefully spent in the violent and sanguinary exercise of the chace The plains of Tartary are filled with a strong and serviceable breed of horses which are easily trained for the purposes of war and hunting The Scythians of every age have been celebrated as bold and skilful riders and constant practice had seated them so firmly on horseback that they were supposed by strangers to perform the ordinary duties of civil life to eat to drink and even to sleep without dismounting from their  steeds They excel in the dexterous management of the lance the long Tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm and the weighty arrow is directed to its object with unerring aim and irresistible force These arrows are often pointed against the harmless animals of the desert which increase and multiply in the absence of their most formidable enemy the hare the goat the roebuck the fallowdeer the stag the elk and the antelope The vigour and patience both of the men and horses are continually exercised by the fatigues of the chace and the plentiful supply of game contributes to the subsistence and even luxury of a Tartar camp But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are not confined to the destruction of timid or innoxious beasts they boldly encounter the angry wildboar when he turns against his pursuers excite the sluggish courage of the bear and provoke the fury of the tyger as he slumbers in the thicket Where there is danger there may be glory and the mode of hunting which opens the fairest field to the exertions of valour may justly be considered as the image and as the school of war The general huntingmatches the pride and delight of the Tartar princes compose an instructive exercise for their numerous cavalry A circle is drawn of many miles in circumference to encompass the game of an extensive district and the troops that form the circle regularly advance towards a common centre where the captive animals surrounded on every  side are abandoned to the darts of the hunters In this march which frequently continues many days the cavalry are obliged to climb the hills to swim the rivers and to wind through the vallies without interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress They acquire the habit of directing their eye and their steps to a remote object of preserving their intervals of suspending or accelerating their pace according to the motions of the troops on their right and left and of watching and repeating the signals of their leaders Their leaders study in this practical school the most important lesson of the military art the prompt and accurate judgment of ground of distance and of time To employ against a human enemy the same patience and valour the same skill and discipline is the only alteration which is required in real war and the amusements of the chace serve as a prelude to the conquest of an empire  Petit de la Croix Vie de Gengiscan l iii c represents the full glory and extent of the Mogul chace The Jesuits Gerbillon and Verbiest followed the emperor Kamhi when he hunted in Tartary Duhalde Description de la Chine tom iv p c folio edit His grandson Kienlong who unites the Tartar discipline with the laws and learning of China describes Eloge de Moukden p as a poet the pleasures which he had often enjoyed as a sportsman    The political society of the ancient Germans  Government  has the appearance of a voluntary alliance of independent warriors The tribes of Scythia distinguished by the modern appellation of  Hords  assume the form of a numerous and increasing family which in the course of successive generations  has been propagated from the same original stock The meanest and most ignorant of the Tartars preserve with conscious pride the inestimable treasure of their genealogy and whatever distinctions of rank may have been introduced by the unequal distribution of pastoral wealth they mutually respect themselves and each other as the descendants of the first founder of the tribe The custom which still prevails of adopting the bravest and most faithful of the captives may countenance the very probable suspicion that this extensive consanguinity is in a great measure legal and fictitious But the useful prejudice which has obtained the sanction of time and opinion produces the effects of truth the haughty Barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience to the head of their blood and their chief or  mursa  as the representative of their great father exercises the authority of a judge in peace and of a leader in war In the original state of the pastoral world each of the  mursas  if we may continue to use a modern appellation acted as the independent chief of a large and separate family and the limits of their peculiar territories were gradually fixed by superior force or mutual consent But the constant operation of various and permanent causes contributed to unite the vagrant Hords into national communities under the command of a supreme head The weak were desirous of support and the strong were ambitious of dominion the power which is the result of union oppressed and collected the divided forces of the  adjacent tribes and as the vanquished were freely admitted to share the advantages of victory the most valiant chiefs hastened to range themselves and their followers under the formidable standard of a confederate nation The most successful of the Tartar princes assumed the military command to which he was entitled by the superiority either of merit or of power He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his equals and the title of  Khan  expresses in the language of the North of Asia the full extent of the regal dignity The right of hereditary succession was long confined to the blood of the founder of the monarchy and at this moment all the Khans who reign from Crimea to the wall of China are the lineal descendants of the renowned Zingis  See the second volume of the Genealogical History of the Tartars and the lists of the Khans at the end of the life of Gengis or Zingis Under the reign of Timur or Tamerlane one of his subjects a descendant of Zingis still bore the regal appellation of Khan and the conqueror of Asia contented himself with the title of Emir or Sultan Abulghazi part v c D'Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale p  But as it is the indispensable duty of a Tartar sovereign to lead his warlike subjects into the field the claims of an infant ar often disregarded and some royal kinsman distinguished by his age and valour is entrusted with the sword and sceptre of his predecessor Two distinct and regular taxes are levied on the tribes to support the dignity of their national monarch and of their peculiar chief and each of those contributions amounts to the tythe both of their property and of their  spoil A Tartar sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his people and as his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a much larger proportion he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic splendor of his court to reward the most deserving or the most favoured of his followers and to obtain from the gentle influence of corruption the obedience which might be sometimes refused to the stern mandates of authority The manners of his subjects accustomed like himself to blood and rapine might excuse in their eyes such partial acts of tyranny as would excite the horror of a civilised people but the power of a despot has never been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia The immediate jurisdiction of the Khan is confined within the limits of his own tribe and the exercise of his royal prerogative has been moderated by the ancient institution of a national council The Coroultai  See the Diets of the ancient Huns de Guignes tom ii p and a curious description of those of Zingis Vie de Gengiscan l i c l iv c Such assemblies are frequently mentioned in the Persian history of Timur though they served only to countenance the resolutions of their master  or Diet of the Tartars was regularly held in the spring and autumn in the midst of a plain where the princes of the reigning family and the mursas of the respective tribes may conveniently assemble on horseback with their martial and numerous trains and the ambitious monarch who reviewed the strength must consult the inclination of an armed people The rudiments of a feudal government  may be discovered in the constitution of the Scythian or Tartar nations but the perpetual conflict of those hostile nations has sometimes terminated in the establishment of a powerful and despotic empire The victor enriched by the tribute and fortified by the arms of dependent kings has spread his conquests over Europe or Asia the successful shepherds of the North have submitted to the confinement of arts of laws and of cities and the introduction of luxury after destroying the freedom of the people has undermined the foundations of the throne  Montesquieu labours to explain a difference which has not existed between the liberty of the Arabs and the  perpetual  slavery of the Tartars Esprit des Loix l xvii c l xviii c c    The memory of past events cannot long be  Situation and extent of Scythia or Tartary  preserved in the frequent and remote emigrations of illiterate Barbarians The modern Tartars are ignorant of the conquests of their ancestors  Abulghazi Khan in the two first parts of his Genealogical History relates the miserable fables and traditions of the Uzbek Tartars concerning the times which preceded the reign of Zingis  and our knowledge of the history of the Scythians is derived from their intercourse with the learned and civilised nations of the South the Greeks the Persians and the Chinese The Greeks who navigated the Euxine and planted their colonies along the seacoast made the gradual and imperfect discovery of Scythia from the Danube and the confines of Thrace as far as the frozen Maeotis the seat of eternal winter and Mount Caucasus which in the language of poetry was described as the utmost  boundary of the earth They celebrated with simple credulity the virtues of the pastoral life  In the thirteenth book of the Iliad Jupiter turns away his eyes from the bloody fields of Troy to the plains of Thrace

Thucydides l ii c  who contemptuously baffled the immense armament of Darius the son of Hystaspes  See the fourth book of Herodotus When Darius advanced into the Moldavian desert between the Danube and the Niester the king of the Scythians sent him a mouse a frog a bird and five arrows a tremendous allegory  The Persian monarchs had extended their western conquests to the banks of the Danube and the limits of European Scythia The eastern provinces of their empire were exposed to the Scythians of Asia the wild inhabitants of the plains beyond the Oxus and the Jaxartes two mighty rivers which direct their course towards the Caspian sea The long and memorable quarrel of Iran and Touran is still the theme of history or romance the famous perhaps the fabulous valour of the Persian heroes Rustan and Asfendiar was signalised in the defence of their country against the Afrasiabs of the North  These wars and heroes may be found under their respective  titles  in the Bibliotheque Orientale of d'Herbelot They have been celebrated in an epic poem of sixty thousand rhymed couplets by Ferdusi the Homer of Persia See the History of Nader Shah p The public must lament that Mr Jones has suspended the pursuit of Oriental learning  and the invincible spirit of the same  Barbarians resisted on the same ground the victorious arms of Cyrus and Alexander  The Caspian sea with its rivers and adjacent tribes are laboriously illustrated in the Examen Critique des Historiens d'Alexandre which compares the true geography and the errors produced by the vanity or ignorance of the Greeks  In the eyes of the Greeks and Persians the real geography of Scythia was bounded on the East by the mountains of Imaus or Caf and their distant prospect of the extreme and inaccessible parts of Asia was clouded by ignorance or perplexed by fiction But those inaccessible regions are the ancient residence of a powerful and civilised nation  The original seat of the nation appears to have been in the Northwest of China in the provinces of Chensi and Chansi Under the two first dynasties the principal town was still a moveable camp the villages were thinly scattered more land was employed in pasture than in tillage the exercise of hunting was ordained to clear the country from wild beasts Petcheli where Pekin stands was a desert and the southern provinces were peopled with Indian savages The dynasty of the  Han  before Christ gave the empire its actual form and extent  which ascends by a probable tradition above forty centuries  The aera of the Chinese monarchy has been variously fixed from to years before Christ and the year has been chosen for the lawful epoch by the authority of the present emperor The difference arises from the uncertain duration of the two first dynasties and the vacant space that lies beyond them as far as the real or fabulous times of Fohi or Hoangti Sematsien dates his authentic chronology from the year the thirtysix eclipses of Confucius thirtyone of which have been verified were observed between the years and before Christ The  historical period  of China does not ascend above the Greek Olympiads  and which is able to verify a series of near two thousand years by the perpetual testimony of accurate and contemporary  historians  After several ages of anarchy and despotism the dynasty of the Han before Christ was the aera of the revival of learning The fragments of ancient literature were restored the characters were improved and fixed and the future preservation of books was secured by the useful inventions of ink paper and the art of printing Ninetyseven years before Christ Sematsien published the first history of China His labours were illustrated and continued by a series of one hundred and eighty historians The substance of

appellation of Scythians or Tartars the vassals the enemies and sometimes the conquerors of a great empire whose policy has uniformly opposed the blind and impetuous valour of the Barbarians of the North From the mouth of the Danube to the sea of Japan the whole longitude of Scythia is about one hundred and ten degrees which in that parallel are equal to more than five thousand miles The latitude of these extensive deserts cannot be so easily or so accurately measured but from the fortieth degree which touches the wall of China we may securely advance above a thousand  miles to the northward till our progress is stopped by the excessive cold of Siberia In that dreary climate instead of the animated picture of a Tartar camp the smoke which issues from the earth or rather from the snow betrays the subterraneous dwellings of the Tongouses and the Samoiedes the want of horses and oxen is imperfectly supplied by the use of reindeer and of large dogs and the conquerors of the earth

formidable empire Towards the East their victorious arms were stopped only by the ocean and the tribes which are thinly scattered between the Amoor and the extreme peninsula of Corea adhered with reluctance to the standard of the Huns On the West near the head of the Irtish and in the vallies of Imaus they found a more ample space and more numerous enemies One of the lieutenants of the Tanjou

side of the North the ocean was assigned as the limit of the power of the Huns Without enemies to resist their progress or witnesses to contradict their vanity they might securely atchieve a real or

vol ii p Bell's Travels vol i p and Gmelin in the Hist Generale des Voyages tom xviii p They all remark the vulgar opinion that the  holy sea  grows angry and tempestuous if any one presumes to call it a  lake  This grammatical nicety often excites a dispute between the absurd superstition of the mariners and the absurd obstinacy of travellers  and which actually communicates with the seas of the North by the long course of the Angara the Tonguska and the Jenissea The submission of so many distant nations might flatter the pride of the Tanjou but the valour of the Huns could be rewarded only by the enjoyment of the wealth and luxury of the empire of the South In the third century before the Christian aera a wall of fifteen hundred miles in length was constructed to defend the frontiers of China against the inroads of the Huns  The construction of the wall of China is mentioned by Duhalde tom ii p and de Guignes tom ii p  but this stupendous work which holds a conspicuous place in the map of the world has never contributed to the safety of an unwarlike people The cavalry of the Tanjou frequently consisted of two or three hundred thousand men formidable by the matchless dexterity with which they managed their bows and their horses by their hardy patience in supporting the inclemency of the weather and by the incredible speed of their march which was seldom checked by torrents

the luxury of the palace submitted to a more permanent disgrace They too hastily confessed the insufficiency of arms and fortifications They were too easily convinced that while the blazing signals announced on every side the approach of the Huns the Chinese troops who slept with the helmet on their head and the cuirass on their back were destroyed by the incessant labour of ineffectual marches  See a free and ample memorial presented by a Mandarin to the emperor Venti before Christ in Duhalde tom ii p from a collection of State papers marked with the red pencil by Kamhi himself p Another memorial from the minister of war KangMou tom ii p supplies some curious circumstances of the manners of the Huns  A regular payment of money and silk was stipulated as the condition  of a temporary and precarious peace and the wretched expedient of disguising a real tribute under the names of a gift or a subsidy was practised by the emperors of China as well as by those of Rome But there still remained a more disgraceful article of tribute which violated the sacred feelings of humanity and nature The hardships of the savage life which destroy in their infancy the children who are born with a less healthy and robust constitution introduce a remarkable disproportion between the numbers of the two sexes The Tartars are an ugly and even deformed race and while they consider their own women as the instruments of domestic labour their desires or rather their appetites are directed to the enjoyment of more elegant beauty A select band of the fairest maidens of China was annually devoted to the rude embraces of the Huns  A supply of women is mentioned as a customary article of treaty and tribute Hist de la Conquête de la Chine par les Tartares Mantcheoux tom i p with the note of the editor  and the alliance of the haughty Tanjous was secured by their marriage with the genuine or adopted daughters of the Imperial family which vainly attempted to escape the sacrilegious pollution The situation of these unhappy victims is described in the verses of a Chinese princess who laments that she had been condemned by her parents to a distant exile under a Barbarian husband who complains that four milk was her only drink raw flesh her only food a tent her only palace and who expresses in a strain of pathetic simplicity the natural wish  that she were transformed into a bird

pastoral tribes of the North the forces of the Huns were not inferior to those of the Moguls or of the Mantcheoux and their ambition might entertain the most sanguine hopes of success But their pride was humbled and their progress was checked by the arms and policy of Vouti  See the reign of the emperor Vouti in the KangMou tom iii p His various and inconsistent character seems to be impartially drawn  the fifth emperor of the powerful dynasty of the Han In his long reign of fiftyfour  Ant Christ  years the Barbarians of the southern provinces submitted to the laws and manners of China and the ancient limits of the monarchy were enlarged from the great river of Kiang to the port of Canton Instead of confining himself to the timid operations of a defensive war his lieutenants penetrated many hundred miles into the country of the Huns In those boundless deserts where it is impossible to form magazines and difficult to transport a sufficient supply of provisions the armies of Vouti were repeatedly exposed to intolerable hardships and of one hundred and forty thousand soldiers who marched against the Barbarians thirty thousand only returned in safety to the feet of their master These losses however were compensated by splendid and decisive success The Chinese generals  improved the superiority which they derived from the temper of their arms their chariots of war and the service of their Tartar auxiliaries The camp of the Tanjou was surprised in the midst of sleep and intemperance and though the monarch of the Huns bravely cut his way through the ranks of the enemy he left above fifteen thousand of his subjects on the field of battle Yet this signal victory which was preceded and followed by many bloody engagements contributed much less to the destruction of the power of the Huns than the effectual policy which was employed to detach the tributary nations from their obedience Intimidated by  Ant Christ  the arms or allured by the promises of Vouti and his successors the most considerable tribes both of the East and of the West disclaimed the authority of the Tanjou While some acknowledged themselves the allies or vassals of the empire they all became the implacable enemies of the Huns and the numbers of that haughty people as soon as they were reduced to their native strength might perhaps have been contained within the walls of one of the great and populous cities of China  This expression is used in the memorial to the emperor Venti Duhalde tom ii p Without adopting the exaggerations of MarcoPolo and Isaac Vossius we may rationally allow for Pekin two millions of inhabitants The cities of the South which contain the manufactures of China are still more populous  The desertion of his subjects and the perplexity of a civil war at length

above all the princes of the royal family and the patience of the Barbarian king was exhausted by the ceremonies of a banquet which consisted of eight courses of meat and of nine solemn pieces of music But he performed on his knees the duty of a respectful homage to the emperor of China pronounced in his own name and in the name of his successors a perpetual oath of fidelity and gratefully accepted a seal which was bestowed as the emblem of his regal dependance After this humiliating submission the Tanjous sometimes departed from their allegiance and seized the favourable moments of war

and powerful tribes of the Huns maintained in their adverse fortune the undaunted spirit of their ancestors The western world was open to their valour and they resolved under the conduct of their hereditary chieftains to discover and subdue some remote country which was still inaccessible to the arms of the Sienpi and to the laws of China  M de Guignes has skilfully traced the footsteps of the Huns through the vast deserts of Tartary tom ii p c c  The course of their emigration soon carried them beyond the mountains of Imaus and the limits of the Chinese geography but  we  are able to distinguish the two great divisions of these formidable exiles which directed their march towards the Oxus and towards the Volga The first of these colonies  The white Huns of Sogdiana  established their dominion in the fruitful and extensive plains of Sogdiana on the Eastern side of the Caspian where they preserved the name of Huns with the epithet of Euthalites or Nepthalites Their manners were softened and even their features were insensibly improved by the mildness of the climate and their long residence in a flourishing province  Mohammed Sultan of Carizme reigned in Sogdiana when it was invaded A D by Zingis and his moguls The Oriental historians see d'Herbelot Petit de la Croix c celebrate the populous cities which he ruined and the fruitful country which he desolated In the next century the same provinces of Chorasmia and Mawaralnahr were described by Abulfeda Hudson Geograph Minor tom iii Their actual misery may be seen in the Genealogical History of the Tartars p  which might  still retain a faint impression of the arts of Greece  Justin xli has left a short abridgment of the Greek kings of Bactriana To their industry I should ascribe the new and extraordinary trade which transported the merchandizes of India into Europe by the Oxus the Caspian the Cyrus the Phasis and the Euxine The other ways both of the land and sea were possessed by the Seleucides and the Ptolemies See l'Esprit des Loix l xxi  The  white  Huns a name which they derived from the change of their complexions soon abandoned the pastoral life of Scythia Gorgo which under the appellation of Carizme has since enjoyed a temporary splendour was the residence of the king who exercised a legal authority over an obedient people Their luxury was maintained by the labour of the Sogdians and the only vestige of their ancient barbarism was the custom which obliged all the companions perhaps to the number of twenty who had shared the liberality of a wealthy lord to be buried alive in the same grave  Procopius de Bell Persico l i c p  The vicinity of the Huns to the provinces of Persia involved them in frequent and bloody contests with the power of that monarchy But they respected in peace the faith of treaties in war the dictates of humanity and their memorable victory over Peroses or Firuz displayed the moderation as well as the valour of the Barbarians The  second  division of their countrymen  The Huns of the Volga  the Huns who gradually advanced towards the  Northwest were exercised by the hardships of a colder climate and a more laborious march Necessity compelled them to exchange the silks of China for the furs of Siberia the imperfect rudiments of civilised life were obliterated and the native fierceness of the Huns was exasperated by their intercourse with the savage tribes who were compared with some propriety to the wild beasts of the desert Their independent spirit soon rejected the hereditary succession of the Tanjous and while each hord was governed by its peculiar Mursa their tumultuary council directed the public measures of the whole nation As late as the thirteenth century their transient residence on the Eastern banks of the Volga was attested by the name of Great Hungary  In the thirteenth century the monk Rubruquis who traversed the immense plain of Kipzak in his journey to the court of the Great Khan observed the remarkable name of  Hungary  with the traces of a common language and origin Hist des Voyages tom vii p  In the winter they descended with their flocks and herds towards the mouth of that mighty river and their summer excursions reached as high as the latitude of Saratoff or perhaps the conflux of the Kama Such at least were the recent limits of the black Calmucks  Bell vol i p and the editors of the Genealogical History p have described the Calmucks of the Volga in the beginning of the present century  who remained about a century under the protection of Russia and who have since returned to their native seats on the frontiers of the Chinese empire The march and the return of those wandering Tartars  whose united camp consists of fifty thousand tents or families illustrate the distant emigrations of the ancient Huns  This great transmigrarion of Calmucks or Torgouts happened in the year The original narrative of Kien long the reigning emperor of China which was intended for the inscription of a

must have gradually oppressed them by the weight and terror of a formidable neighbourhood and the flight of the tribes of Scythia would inevitably tend to increase the strength or to contract the territories of the Huns The harsh and obscure appellations of those tribes would offend the ear without informing  the understanding of the reader but I cannot suppress the very natural suspicion  that  the Huns of the North derived a considerable reinforcement from the ruin of the dynasty of the South which in the course of the third century submitted to the dominion of China  that  the bravest warriors marched away in search of their free and adventurous countrymen  and  that as they had been divided by prosperity they were easily reunited by the common hardships of their adverse fortune  See the Histoire des Huns tom ii p The subsequent history p of three or four Hunnic dynasties evidently proves that their martial spirit was not impaired by a long residence in China  The Huns with their flocks and herds their wives and children their dependents and allies were transported to the West of the Volga and they boldly advanced to invade the country of the Alani a pastoral people who occupied or wasted an extensive tract of the deserts of Scythia The plains between the Volga and the Tanais were covered with the tents of the Alani but their name and manners were diffused over the wide extent of their conquests and the painted tribes of the Agathyrsi and Geloni were confounded among their vassals Towards the North they penetrated into the frozen regions of Siberia among the savages who were accustomed in their rage or hunger to the taste of human flesh and their Southern inroads were pushed as far as the confines of Persia and India The mixture of Sarmatic and  German blood had contributed to improve the features of the Alani to whiten their swarthy complexions and to tinge their hair with a yellowish cast which is seldom found in the Tartar race They were less deformed in their persons less brutish in their manners than the Huns but they did not yield to those formidable Barbarians in their martial and independent spirit in the love of freedom which rejected even the use of domestic slaves and in the love of arms which considered war and rapine as the pleasure and the glory of mankind A naked scymetar fixed in the ground was the only object of their religious worship the scalps of their enemies formed the costly trappings of their horses and they viewed with pity and contempt the pusillanimous warriors who patiently expected the infirmities of age and the tortures of lingering disease  Utque hominibus quietis et placidis otium est voluptabile ita illos pericula juvant et bella Judicatur ibi beatus qui in proelio profuderit animam

military power of the Huns and the Alani encountered each other with equal valour but with unequal success The Huns prevailed in the bloody contest the king of the Alani was slain and the remains of the vanquished nation were dispersed by the ordinary alternative of flight or submission  On the subject of the Alani see Ammianus xxxi Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c M de Guignes Hist des Huns tom ii p and the Genealogical History of the Tartars tom ii p  A colony of exiles found a secure  refuge in the mountains of Caucasus between the Euxine and the Caspian where they still preserve their name and their independence Another colony advanced with more intrepid courage towards the shores of the Baltic associated themselves with the Northern tribes of Germany and shared the spoil of the Roman provinces of Gaul and Spain But the greatest part of the nation of the Alani embraced the offers of an honourable and advantageous union and the Huns who esteemed the valour of their less fortunate

their foul and deadly practices had been driven from society had copulated in the desert with infernal spirits and that the Huns were the offspring of this execrable conjunction  This execrable origin which Jornandes c describes with the rancour of a Goth might be originally derived from a more pleasing fable of the Greeks Herodot l iv c c  The tale so full of horror and absurdity was greedily embraced by the credulous hatred of the Goths but while it gratified their hatred it encreased their fear since the posterity of daemons and witches might be supposed to inherit some share of the praeternatural  powers as well as of the malignant temper of their parents Against these enemies Hermanric prepared to exert the united forces of the Gothic state but he soon discovered that his vassal tribes provoked by oppression were much more inclined to second than to repel the invasion of the Huns One of the chiefs of the Roxolani  The Roxolani may be the fathers of the  the  Russians

standard of Hermanric and the cruel tyrant had condemned the innocent wife of the traitor to be torn asunder by wild horses The brothers of that unfortunate woman seized the favourable moment of revenge The aged king of the Goths languished some time after the dangerous wound which he received from their daggers but the conduct of the war was retarded by his infirmities and the public councils of the nation were distracted by a spirit of jealousy and discord His death which has been imputed to his own despair left the reins of government in the hands of Withimer who with the doubtful aid of some Scythian mercenaries maintained the unequal contest against the arms of the Huns and the Alani till he was defeated and slain in a decisive battle The Ostrogoths submitted to their fate and the royal race of the Amali will hereafter be found among the subjects of the haughty Attila But the person of Witheric the infant king was saved by  the diligence of Alatheus and Saphrax two warriors of approved valour and fidelity who by cautious marches conducted the independent remains of the nation of the Ostrogoths towards the Danastus or Niester a considerable river which now separates the Turkish dominions from the empire of Russia On the banks of the Niester the prudent Athanaric more attentive to his own than to the general safety had fixed the camp of the Visigoths with the firm resolution of opposing the victorious Barbarians whom he thought it less advisable to provoke The ordinary speed of the Huns was checked by the weight of baggage and the incumbrance of captives but their military skill deceived and almost destroyed the army of Athanaric While the judge of the Visigoths defended the banks of the Niester he was encompassed and attacked by a numerous detachment of cavalry who by the light of the moon had passed the river in a fordable place and it was not without the utmost efforts of courage and conduct that he was able to effect his retreat towards the hilly country The undaunted general had already formed a new and judicious plan of defensive war and the strong lines which he was preparing to construct between the mountains the Pruth and the Danube would have secured the extensive and fertile territory that bears the modern name of Walachia from the destructive inroads of the Huns  The text of Ammianus seems to be imperfect or corrupt but the nature of the ground explains and almost defines the Gothic rampart Memoires de l'Academie c tom xxviii p  But the  hopes and measures of the judge of the Visigoths were soon disappointed by the trembling impatience of his dismayed countrymen who were persuaded by their fears that the interposition of the Danube was the only barrier that could save them from the rapid

country of Caucaland which appears to have been guarded and almost concealed by the impenetrable forests of Transylvania  Ammianus xxxi and Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c describe the subversion of the

arguments more  prevalent than those of reason and eloquence the belief of the Arian theology and to satisfy his anxious suspicions by the promiscuous execution of the innocent and the guilty But the attention of the emperor was most seriously engaged by the important intelligence which he received from the civil and military officers who were entrusted with the defence of the Danube He was informed that the North was agitated by a furious tempest that the irruption of the Huns an unknown and monstrous race of savages had subverted the power of the Goths and that the suppliant multitudes of that warlike nation whose pride was now humbled in the dust covered a space of many miles along the banks of the river With outstretched arms and pathetic lamentations they loudly deplored their past misfortunes and their present danger acknowledged that their only hope of safety was in the clemency of the Roman government and most solemnly protested that if the gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the waste lands of Thrace they should ever hold themselves bound by the strongest obligations of duty and gratitude to obey the laws and to guard the limits of the republic These assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths who impatiently expected from the mouth of Valens an answer that must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen The emperor of the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and authority of his elder brother whose death happened  A D Nov  towards the end of the preceding year  and as the distressful situation of the Goths required an instant and peremptory decision he was deprived of the favourite resource of feeble and timid minds who consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence As long as the same passions and interests subsist among mankind the questions of war and peace of justice and policy which were debated in the councils of antiquity will frequently present themselves as the subject of modern deliberation But the most experienced statesman of Europe has never been summoned to consider the propriety or the danger of admitting or rejecting an innumerable multitude of Barbarians who are driven by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a civilised nation When that important proposition so essentially connected with the public safety was referred to the ministers of Valens they were perplexed and divided but they soon acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most favourable to the pride the indolence and the avarice of their sovereign The slaves who were decorated with the titles of praefects and generals dissembled or disregarded the terrors of this national emigration so extremely different from the partial and accidental colonies which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire But they applauded the liberality of fortune which had conducted from the most distant countries of the globe a numerous and invincible army of strangers to defend the throne of Valens who might now add  to the royal treasures the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their annual proportion of recruits The prayers of the Goths were granted and their service was accepted by the Imperial court and orders were immediately dispatched to the civil and military governors of the Thracian diocese to make the necessary preparations for the passage and subsistence of a great people till a proper and sufficient territory could be allotted for their future residence The liberality of the emperor was accompanied however with two harsh and rigorous conditions which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans but which distress alone could extort from the indignant Goths Before they passed the Danube they were required to deliver their arms and it was insisted that their children should be taken from them and dispersed through the provinces of Asia where they might be civilised by the arts of education and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their parents  During this suspense of a doubtful and distant  They are transported over the Danube into the Roman empire  negociation the impatient Goths made some rash attempts to pass the Danube without the permission of the government whose protection they had implored Their motions were strictly observed by the vigilance of the troops which were stationed along the river and their foremost detachments were defeated with considerable slaughter yet such were the timid councils of the reign of Valens that the brave officers who  had served their country in the execution of their duty were punished by the loss of their employments and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads The Imperial mandate was at length received for transporting over the Danube the whole body of the Gothic nation  The passage of the Danube is exposed by Ammianus xxxi Zosimus l iv p Eunapius in Excerpt Legat p and Jornandes c Ammianus declares c that he means only ipsas rerum digerere  summitates  But he often takes a false measure of their importance and his superfluous prolixity is disagreeably balanced by his unseasonable brevity  but the execution of this order was a task of labour and difficulty The stream of the Danube which in those parts is above a mile broad  Chishull a curious traveller has remarked the breadth of the Danube which he passed to the south of Bucharest near the conflux of the Argish p He admires the beauty and spontaneous plenty of Maesia or Bulgaria  had been swelled by incessant rains and in this tumultuous passage many were swept away and drowned by the rapid violence of the current A large fleet of vessels of boats and of canoes was provided many days and nights they passed and repassed with indefatigable toil and the most strenuous diligence was exerted by the officers of Valens that not a single Barbarian of those who were reserved to subvert the foundations of Rome should be left on the opposite shore It was thought expedient that an accurate account should be taken of their numbers but the persons who were employed soon desisted with amazement and dismay from the prosecution of the endless  and impracticable task  Quem si scire velit Libyci velit aequoris idem  Scire quam multae Zephyro truduntur harenae Ammianus has inserted in his prose these lines of Virgil Georgic l ii originally designed by the poet to express the impossibility of numbering the different sorts of vines See Plin Hist Natur l xiv  and the principal historian of the age most seriously affirms that the prodigious armies of Darius and Xerxes which had so long been considered as the fables of vain and credulous antiquity were now justified in the eyes of mankind by the evidence of fact and experience A probable testimony has fixed the number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred thousand men and if we can venture to add the just proportion of women of children and of slaves the whole mass of people which composed this formidable emigration must have amounted to near a million of persons of both sexes and of all ages The children of the Goths those at least of a distinguished rank were separated from the multitude They were conducted without delay to the distant seats assigned for their residence and education and as the numerous train of hostages or captives passed through the cities their gay and splendid apparel their robust and martial figure excited the surprise and envy of the Provincials But the stipulation the most offensive to the Goths and the most important to the Romans was shamefully eluded The Barbarians who considered their arms as the ensigns of honour and the pledges of safety were disposed to offer a price which the lust or avarice of the Imperial officers was easily tempted to  accept To preserve their arms the haughty warriors consented with some reluctance to prostitute their wives or their daughters the charms of a beauteous maid or a comely boy secured the connivance of the inspectors who sometimes cast an eye of covetousness on the fringed carpets and linen garments of their new allies  Eunapius and Zosimus curiously specify these articles of Gothic wealth and luxury Yet it must be presumed that they were the manufactures of the provinces which the Barbarians had acquired as the spoils of war or as the gifts or merchandise of peace  or who sacrificed their duty to the mean consideration of filling their farms with cattle and their houses with slaves The Goths with arms in their hands were permitted to enter the boats and when their strength was collected on the other side of the river the immense camp which was spread over the plains and the hills of the Lower Maesia assumed a threatening and even hostile aspect The leaders of the Ostrogoths Alatheus and Saphrax the guardians of their infant king appeared soon afterwards on the Northern banks of the Danube and immediately dispatched their ambassadors to the court of Antioch to solicit with the same professions of allegiance and gratitude the same favour which had been granted to the suppliant Visigoths The absolute refusal of Valens suspended their progress and discovered the repentance the suspicions and the fears of the Imperial council  An undisciplined and unsettled nation of Barbarians  Their distress and discontent  required the firmest temper and the most dexterous management The daily subsistence  of near a million of extraordinary subjects could be supplied only by constant and skilful diligence and might continually be interrupted by mistake or accident The insolence or the indignation of the Goths if they conceived themselves to be the objects either of fear or of contempt might urge them to the most desperate extremities and the fortune of the state seemed to depend on the prudence as well as the integrity of the generals of Valens At this important crisis the military government of Thrace was exercised by Lupicinus and Maximus in whose venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument outweighed every consideration of public advantage and whose guilt was only alleviated by their incapacity of discerning the pernicious effects of their rash and criminal administration Instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign and satisfying with decent liberality the demands of the Goths they levied an ungenerous and oppressive tax on the wants of the hungry Barbarians The vilest food was sold at an extravagant price and in the room of wholsome and substantial provisions the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs and of unclean animals who had died of disease To obtain the valuable acquisition of a pound of bread the Goths resigned the possession of an expensive though serviceable slave and a small quantity of meat was greedily purchased with ten pounds of a precious but useless metal  Decem libras  the word  silver  must be understood Jornandes betrays the passions and prejudices of a Goth The servile Greeks Eunapius and Zosimus disguise the Roman oppression and execrate the perfidy of the Barbarians Ammianus a patriot historian flightly and reluctantly touches on the odious subject Jerom who wrote almost on the spot is fair though concise Per avaritiam Maximi ducis ad rebellionem fame  coacti  sunt in Chron  When their  property was exhausted they continued this necessary traffic by the sale of their sons and daughters and notwithstanding the love of freedom which animated every Gothic breast they submitted to the humiliating maxim that it was better for their children to be maintained in a servile condition than to perish in a state of wretched and helpless independence The most lively resentment is excited by the tyranny of pretended benefactors who sternly exact the debt of gratitude which they have cancelled by subsequent injuries a spirit of discontent insensibly arose in the camp of the Barbarians who pleaded without success the merit of their patient and dutiful behaviour and loudly complained of the inhospitable treatment which they had received from their new allies They beheld around them the wealth and plenty of a fertile province in the midst of which they suffered the intolerable hardships of artificial famine But the means of relief and even of revenge were in their hands since the rapaciousness of their tyrants had left to an injured people the possession and the use of arms The clamours of a multitude untaught to disguise their sentiments announced the first symptoms of resistance and alarmed the timid and guilty minds of Lupicinus and Maximus Those crafty ministers who substituted  the cunning of temporary expedients to the wise and salutary counsels of general policy attempted to remove the Goths from their dangerous station on the frontiers of the empire and to disperse them in separate quarters of cantonment through the interior provinces As they were conscious how ill they had deserved the respect or confidence of the Barbarians they diligently collected from every side a military force that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people who had not yet renounced the title or the duties of Roman subjects But the generals of Valens while their attention was solely directed to the discontented Visigoths imprudently disarmed the ships and the fortifications which constituted the defence of the Danube The fatal oversight was observed and improved by Alatheus and Saphrax who anxiously watched the favourable moment of escaping from the pursuit of the Huns By the help of such rafts and vessels as could be hastily procured the leaders of the Ostrogoths transported without opposition their king and their army and boldly fixed an hostile and independent camp on the territories of the empire  Ammianus xxxi    Under the name of judges Alavivus and Fritigern  Revolt of the Goths in Maesia and their first victories  were the leaders of the Visigoths in peace and war and the authority which they derived from their birth was ratified by the free consent of the nation In a season of tranquillity their power might have been equal as well as their  rank but as soon as their countrymen were exasperated by hunger and oppression the superior abilities of Fritigern assumed the military command which he was qualified to exercise for the public welfare He restrained the impatient spirit of the Visigoths till the injuries and the insults of their tyrants should justify their resistance in the opinion of mankind but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid advantages for the empty praise of justice and moderation Sensible of the benefits which would result from the union of the Gothic powers under the same standard he secretly cultivated the friendship of the Ostrogoths and while he professed an implicit obedience to the orders of the Roman generals he proceeded by slow marches towards Marcianopolis the capital of the Lower Maesia about seventy miles from the banks of the Danube On that fatal spot the flames of discord and mutual hatred burst forth into a dreadful conflagration Lupicinus had invited the Gothic chiefs to a splendid entertainment and their martial train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace But the gates of the city were strictly guarded and the Barbarians were sternly excluded from the use of a plentiful market to which they asserted their equal claim of subjects and allies Their humble prayers were rejected with insolence and derision and as their patience was now exhausted the townsmen the soldiers and the Goths were soon involved in a conflict of passionate altercation and angry reproaches  A blow was imprudently given a sword was hastily drawn and the first blood that was spilt in this accidental quarrel became the signal of a long and destructive war In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance Lupicinus was informed by a secret messenger that many of his soldiers were slain and despoiled of their arms and as he was already inflamed by wine and oppressed by sleep he issued a rash command that their death should be revenged by the massacre of the guards of Fritigern and Alavivus The clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern of his extreme danger and as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit of a hero he saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man who had so deeply injured him  A trifling dispute said the Gothic leader with a firm but gentle tone of voice appears to have arisen between the two nations but it may be productive of the most dangerous consequences unless the tumult is immediately pacified by the assurance of our safety and the authority of our presence  At these words Fritigern and his companions drew their swords opened their passage through the unresisting crowd which filled the palace the streets and the gates of Marcianopolis and mounting their horses hastily vanished from the eyes of the astonished Romans The generals of the Goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp war was instantly resolved and the resolution was  executed without delay the banners of the nation were displayed according to the custom of their ancestors and the air resounded with the harsh and mournful music of the Barbarian trumpet  Vexillis de  more  sublatis auditisque  triste sonautibus classicis  Ammian xxxi These are the  rauca cornua  of Claudian in Rufin ii the large horns of the  Uri  or wild bull such as have been more recently used by the Swiss Cantons of

to edition of Philippe de Comines tom iii p  The weak and guilty Lupicinus who had dared to provoke who had neglected to destroy and who still presumed to despise his formidable enemy marched against the Goths at the head of such a military force as could be collected on this sudden emergency The Barbarians expected his approach about nine miles from Marcianopolis and on this occasion the talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing efficacy than the weapons and discipline of the troops The valour of the Goths was so ably directed by the genius of Fritigern that they broke by a close and vigorous attack the ranks of the Roman legions Lupicinus left his arms and standards his tribunes and his bravest soldiers on the field of battle and their useless courage served only to protect the ignominious flight of their leader  That successful day put an end to the distress of the Barbarians and the security of the Romans from that day the Goths renouncing the precarious condition of strangers and exiles assumed the character of citizens and masters claimed an absolute dominion over the possessors of land and held in their own right the northern provinces of the empire which are bounded by the Danube  Such are the  words of the Gothic historian  Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c p edit Grot These  splendidi panni  they are comparatively such are undoubtedly transcribed from the larger histories of Priscus Ablavius or Cassiodorius  who celebrates with rude eloquence the glory of his countrymen But the dominion of the Barbarians was exercised only for the purposes of rapine and destruction As they had been deprived by the ministers of the emperor of the common benefits of nature and the fair intercourse of social life they retaliated the injustice on the subjects of the empire and the crimes of Lupicinus were expiated  They penetrate into Thrace  by the ruin of the peaceful husbandmen of Thrace the conflagration of their villages and the massacre or captivity of their innocent families The report of the Gothic victory was soon diffused over the adjacent country and while it filled the minds of the Romans with terror and dismay their own hasty imprudence contributed to increase the forces of Fritigern and the calamities of the province Some time before the great emigration a numerous body of Goths under the command of Suerid and Colias had been received into the protection and service of  the empire  Cum populis suis longe ante suscepti We are ignorant of the precise date and circumstances of their transmigration  They were encamped under the walls of Hadrianople but the ministers of Valens were anxious to remove them beyond the Hellespont at a distance from the dangerous temptation which might so easily be communicated by the neighbourhood and the success of their countrymen The respectful submission with which they yielded to the order of their march might be considered as a proof of their fidelity and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of provisions and of a delay of only two days was expressed in the most dutiful terms But the first magistrate of Hadrianople incensed by some disorders which had been committed at his countryhouse refused this indulgence and arming against them the inhabitants and manufacturers of a populous city he urged with hostile threats their instant departure The Barbarians stood silent and amazed till they were exasperated by the insulting clamours and missile weapons of the populace but when patience or contempt was fatigued they crushed the undisciplined multitude inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs of their flying enemies and despoiled them of the splendid armour  An Imperial manufacture of shields c was established at Hadrianople and the populace were headed by the  Fabricenses  or workmen Vales ad Ammian xxxi  which they were unworthy to bear The resemblance of their sufferings and their actions soon united this victorious detachment to the nation of the  Visigoths the troops of Colias and Suerid expected the approach of the great Fritigern ranged themselves under his standard and signalised their ardour in the siege of Hadrianople But the resistance of the garrison informed the Barbarians that in the attack of regular fortifications the efforts of unskilful courage are seldom effectual Their general acknowledged his error raised the siege declared that  he was at peace with stone walls  Pacem sibi esse cum parietibus memorans Ammian xxxi    and revenged his disappointment on the adjacent country He accepted with pleasure the useful reinforcement of hardy workmen who laboured in the gold mines of Thrace  These mines were in the country of the Bessi in the ridge of mountains the Rhodope that runs between Philippi and Philippopolis two Macedonian cities which derived their name and origin from the father of Alexander From the mines of Thrace he annually received the value not the weight of a thousand

drag them from their hidingplaces Cod Theodosian l x tit xix leg  and these new associates conducted the Barbarians through the secret paths to the most sequestered places which had been chosen to secure the inhabitants the cattle and the magazines of corn With the assistance of such guides nothing could remain impervious or inaccessible resistance was fatal flight was impracticable and the patient submission  of helpless innocence seldom found mercy from the Barbarian conqueror In the course of these depredations a great number of the children of the Goths who had been sold into captivity were restored to the embraces of their afflicted parents but these tender interviews which might have revived and cherished in their minds some sentiments of humanity tended only to stimulate their native fierceness by the desire of revenge They listened with eager attention to the complaints of their captive children who had suffered the most cruel indignities from the lustful or angry passions of their masters and the same cruelties the same indignities were severely retaliated on the sons and daughters of the Romans  See Ammianus xxxi The historian of the Gothic war loses

of the empire a nation of enemies but the Visigoths might even yet have been reconciled by the manly confession of past errors and the sincere performance of former engagements These healing and temperate measures seemed to concur with the timorous disposition of the sovereign of the East but on this occasion alone Valens was brave and his unseasonable bravery was fatal to himself and to his subjects He declared his intention of marching from Antioch to Constantinople to subdue this dangerous rebellion and as he was not  ignorant of the difficulties of the enterprise he solicited the assistance of his nephew the emperor Gratian who commanded all the forces of the West The veteran troops were hastily recalled from the defence of Armenia that important frontier was abandoned to the discretion of Sapor and the immediate conduct of the Gothic war was entrusted during the absence of Valens to his lieutenants Trajan and Profuturus two generals who indulged themselves in a very false and favourable opinion of their own abilities On their arrival in Thrace they were joined by Richomer count of the domestics and the auxiliaries of the West that marched under his banner were composed of the Gallic legions reduced indeed by a spirit of desertion to the vain appearances of strength and numbers In a council of war which was influenced by pride rather than by reason it was resolved to seek and to encounter the Barbarians who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile meadows near the most southern of the six mouths of the Danube  The Itinerary of Antoninus p edit Wesseling marks the situation of this place about sixty miles north of Tomi Ovid's exile and the name of  Salices  the willows expresses the nature of the soil  Their camp was surrounded by the usual fortification of

Romans He perceived that the numbers of the enemy were continually increasing and as he understood their intention of attacking his rear as soon as the scarcity of forage should oblige him to remove his camp he recalled to their standard his predatory detachments which covered the adjacent country As soon as they descried the flaming beacons  Statim ut accensi malleoli I have used the literal sense of real torches or beacons but I almost suspect that it is only one of those turgid metaphors those false ornaments that perpetually disfigure the style of Ammianus  they obeyed with incredible speed the signal of their leader the camp was filled with the martial crowd of Barbarians their impatient clamours demanded the battle and their tumultuous zeal was approved and animated by the spirit of their chiefs The evening was already far advanced and the two armies prepared themselves for the approaching combat which was deferred only till the dawn of day While the trumpets sounded to arms the undaunted courage of the Goths was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath and as they advanced to meet the enemy the rude songs which celebrated the glory of their forefathers were mingled with their fierce and dissonant outcries and opposed to the artificial harmony of  the Roman shout Some military skill was displayed by Fritigern to gain the advantage of a commanding eminence but the bloody conflict which began and ended with the light was maintained on either side by the personal and obstinate efforts of strength valour and agility The legions of Armenia supported their fame in arms but they were oppressed by the irresistible weight of the hostile multitude the left wing of the Romans was thrown into disorder and the field was strewed with their mangled carcasses This partial defeat was balanced however by partial success and when the two armies at a late hour of the evening retreated to their respective camps neither of them could claim the honours or the effects of a decisive victory The real loss was more severely felt by the Romans in proportion to the smallness of their numbers but the Goths were so deeply confounded and dismayed by this vigorous and perhaps unexpected resistance that they remained seven days within the circle of their fortifications Such funeral rites as the circumstances of time and place would admit were piously discharged to some officers of distinguished rank but the indiscriminate vulgar was left unburied on the plain Their flesh was greedily devoured by the birds of prey who in that age enjoyed very frequent and delicious feasts and several years afterwards the white and naked bones which covered the wide extent of the fields presented  to the eyes of Ammianus a dreadful monument of the battle of Salices

The progress of the Goths had been checked  Union of the Goths with the Huns Alani c  by the doubtful event of that bloody day and the Imperial generals whose army would have been consumed by the repetition of such a contest embraced the more rational plan of destroying the Barbarians by the wants and pressure of their own multitudes They prepared to confine the Visigoths in the narrow angle of land between the Danube the desert of Scythia and the mountains of Haemus till their strength and spirit should be insensibly wasted by the inevitable operation of famine The design was prosecuted with some conduct and success the Barbarians had almost exhausted their own magazines and the harvests of the country and the diligence of Saturninus the mastergeneral of the cavalry was employed to improve the strength and to contract the extent of the Roman fortifications His labours were interrupted by the alarming intelligence that new swarms of Barbarians had passed the unguarded Danube either to support the cause or to imitate the example of Fritigern The just apprehension that he himself might be surrounded and overwhelmed by the arms of hostile and unknown nations  compelled Saturninus to relinquish the siege of the Gothic camp and the indignant Visigoths breaking from their confinement satiated their hunger and revenge by the repeated devastation of the fruitful country which extends above three hundred miles from the banks of the Danube to the streights of the Hellespont  Ammian xxxi  The sagacious Fritigern had successfully appealed to the passions as well as to the interest of his Barbarian allies and the love of rapine and the hatred of Rome seconded or even prevented the eloquence of his ambassadors He cemented a strict and useful alliance with the great body of his countrymen who obeyed Alatheus and Saphrax as the guardians of their infant king the long animosity of rival tribes was suspended by the sense of their common interest the independent part of the nation was associated under one standard and the chiefs of the Ostrogoths appear to have yielded to the superior genius of the general of the Visigoths He obtained the formidable aid of the Taifalae whose military renown was disgraced and polluted by the public infamy of their domestic manners Every youth on his entrance into the world was united by the ties of honourable friendship and brutal love to some warrior of the tribe nor could he hope to be released from this unnatural connection till he had approved his manhood by slaying in single combat a huge bear or a wild boar of the forest  Hanc Taifalorum gentem turpem et obscenae vitae flagitiis ita accipimus mersam ut apud eos nefandi concubitûs foedere copulentur mares puberes aetatis viriditatem in eorum pollutis usibus

bands of friendship were confirmed and sullied by unnatural love    But the most powerful auxiliaries of the Goths were drawn from the camp of those enemies who had expelled them from their native seats The loose subordination and extensive possessions of the Huns and the Alani delayed the conquests and distracted the councils of that victorious people Several of the hords were allured by the liberal promises of Fritigern and the rapid cavalry of Scythia added weight and energy to the steady and strenuous efforts of the Gothic infantry The Sarmatians who could never forgive the successor of Valentinian enjoyed and encreased the general confusion and a seasonable irruption of the Alemanni into the provinces of Gaul engaged the attention and diverted the forces of the emperor of the

most dangerous inconveniencies of  Victory of Gratian over the Alemanni A D May  the introduction of the Barbarians into the army and the palace was sensibly felt in their correspondence with their hostile countrymen to whom they imprudently or maliciously revealed the weakness of the Roman empire A soldier of the lifeguards of Gratian was of the nation  of the Alemanni and of the tribe of the Lentienses who dwelt beyond the lake of Constance Some domestic business obliged him to request a leave of absence In a short visit to his family and friends he was exposed to their curious inquiries and the vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him to display his intimate acquaintance with the secrets of the state and the designs of his master The intelligence that Gratian was preparing to lead the military force of Gaul and of the West to the assistance of his uncle Valens pointed out to the restless spirit of the Alemanni the moment and the mode of a succesful invasion The enterprise of some light detachments who in the month of February passed the Rhine upon the ice was the prelude of a more important war The boldest hopes of rapine perhaps of conquest outweighed the considerations of timid prudence or national faith Every forest and every village poured forth a band of hardy adventurers and the great army of the Alemanni which on their approach was estimated at forty thousand men by the fears of the people was afterwards magnified to the number of seventy thousand by the vain and credulous flattery of the Imperial court The legions which had been ordered to march into Pannonia were immediately recalled or detained for the defence of Gaul the military command was divided between Nanienus and Mellobaudes and the youthful emperor though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom of the former  was much more inclined to admire and to follow the martial ardour of his colleague who was allowed to unite the incompatible characters of count of the domestics and of king of the Franks His rival Priarius king of the Alemanni was guided or rather impelled by the same headstrong valour and as their troops were animated by the spirit of their leaders they met they saw they encountered each other near the town of Argentaria or Colmar  The field of battle  Argentaria  or  Argentovaria  is accurately fixed by M d'Anville Notice de l'Ancienne Gaul p at twentythree Gallic leagues or thirtyfour and a half Roman miles to the south of Strasburgh From its ruins the adjacent town of  Colmar  has arisen  in the plains of Alsace The glory of the day was justly ascribed to the missile weapons and wellpractised evolutions of the Roman soldiers the Alemanni who long maintained their ground were slaughtered with unrelenting fury five thousand only of the Barbarians escaped to the woods and mountains and the glorious death of their king on the field of battle saved him from the reproaches of the people who are always disposed to accuse the justice or policy of an unsuccessful war After this signal victory which secured the peace of Gaul and asserted the honour of the Roman arms the emperor Gratian appeared to proceed without delay on his Eastern expedition but as he approached the confines of the Alemanni he suddenly inclined to the left surprised them by his unexpected passage of the Rhine and boldly advanced into the heart of their country  The Barbarians opposed to his progress the obstacles of nature and of courage and still continued to retreat from one hill to another till they were satisfied by repeated trials of the power and perseverance of their enemies Their submission was accepted as a proof not indeed of their sincere repentance but of their actual distress and a select number of their brave and robust youth was exacted from the faithless nation as the most substantial pledge of their future moderation The subjects of the empire who had so often experienced that the Alemanni could neither be subdued by arms nor restrained by treaties might not promise themselves any solid or lasting tranquillity but they discovered in the virtues of their young sovereign the prospect of a long and auspicious reign When the legions climbed the mountains and scaled the fortifications of the Barbarians the valour of Gratian was distinguished in the foremost ranks and the gilt and variegated armour of his guards was pierced and shattered by the blows which they had received in their constant attachment to the person of their sovereign At the age of nineteen the son of Valentinian seemed to possess the talents of peace and war and his personal success against the Alemanni was interpreted as a sure presage of his Gothic triumphs  The full and impartial narrative of Ammianus xxxi may derive some additional light from the Epitome of Victor the Chronicle of Jerom and the History of Orosius l vii c p edit Havercamp    While Gratian deserved and enjoyed the applause of his subjects the emperor Valens who at length had removed his court and army from  Valens marches against the Goths A D May June  Antioch was received by the people of Constantinople as the author of the public calamity Before he had reposed himself ten days in the capital he was urged by the licentious clamours of the Hippodrome to march against the Barbarians whom he had invited into his dominions and the citizens who are always brave at a distance from any real danger declared with confidence that if they were supplied with arms  they  alone would undertake to deliver the province from the ravages of an insulting foe  Moratus paucissimos dies seditione popularium luvium pulsus Ammian xxxi Socrates l iv c supplies the dates and some circumstances  The vain reproaches of an ignorant multitude hastened the downfal of the Roman empire they provoked the desperate rashness of Valens who did not sind either in his reputation or in his mind any motives to support with firmness the public contempt He was soon persuaded by the successful atchievements of his lieutenants to despise the power of the Goths who by the diligence of Fritigern were now collected in the neighbourhood of Hadrianople The march of the Taifalae had been intercepted by the valiant Frigerid the king of those licentious Barbarians was slain in battle and the suppliant captives were sent into distant exile to cultivate the lands of Italy which were assigned for their settlement in the vacant territories of Modena and  Parma  Vivosque omnes circa Mutinam Regiumque et Parmam Italica oppida rura culturos exterminavit Ammianus xxxi Those cities

hate Sebastian the praise of Zosimus is disgrace Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p His prejudice and ignorance undoubtedly render him a very questionable judge of merit  who was recently engaged in the service of Valens and promoted to the rank of mastergeneral of the infantry were still more honourable to himself and useful to the republic He obtained the permission of selecting three hundred soldiers from each of the legions and this separate detachment soon acquired the spirit of discipline and the exercise of arms which were almost forgotten under the reign of Valens By the vigour and conduct of Sebastian a large body of the Goths was surprised in their camp and the immense spoil which was recovered from their hands filled the city of Hadrianople and the adjacent plain The splendid narratives which the general transmitted of his own exploits alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of superior merit and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the Gothic war his valour was praised his advice was rejected and Valens who listened with pride and pleasure to the flattering suggestions of the eunuchs of the palace was impatient to seize the glory of an easy and  assured conquest His army was strengthened by a numerous reinforcement of veterans and his march from Constantinople to Hadrianople was conducted with so much military skill that he prevented the activity of the Barbarians who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles and to intercept either the troops themselves or their convoys of provisions The camp of Valens which he pitched under the walls of Hadrianople was fortified according to the practice of the Romans with a ditch and rampart and a most important council was summoned to decide the fate of the emperor and of the empire The party of reason and of delay was strenuously maintained by Victor who had corrected by the lessons of experience the native fierceness of the Sarmatian character while Sebastian with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a courtier represented every precaution and every measure that implied a doubt of immediate victory as unworthy of the courage and majesty of their invincible monarch The ruin of Valens was precipitated by the deceitful arts of Fritigern and the prudent admonitions of the emperor of the West The advantages of negociating in the midst of war were perfectly understood by the general of the Barbarians and a Christian ecclesiastic was dispatched as the holy minister of peace to penetrate and to perplex the councils of the enemy The misfortunes as well as the provocations of the Gothic nation were forcibly and truly described by their ambassador who  protested in the name of Fritigern that he was still disposed to lay down his arms or to employ them only in the defence of the empire if he could secure for his wandering countrymen a tranquil settlement on the waste lands of Thrace and a sufficient allowance of corn and cattle But he added in a whisper of confidential friendship that the exasperated Barbarians were averse to these reasonable conditions and that Fritigern was doubtful whether he could accomplish the conclusion of the treaty unless he found himself supported by the presence and terrors of an Imperial army About the same time Count Richomer returned from the West to announce the defeat and submission of the Alemanni to inform Valens that his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran and victorious legions of Gaul and to request in the name of Gratian and of the republic that every dangerous and decisive measure might be suspended till the junction of the two emperors should ensure the success of the Gothic war But the feeble sovereign of the East was actuated only by the fatal illusions of pride and jealousy He disdained the importunate advice he rejected the humiliating aid he secretly compared the ignominious at least the inglorious period of his own reign with the fame of a beardless youth and Valens rushed into the field to erect his imaginary trophy before the diligence of his colleague could usurp any share of the triumphs of the day  On the ninth of August a day which has deserved to be marked among the most inauspicious of the Roman Calendar  Ammianus xxxi almost alone describes the councils and actions which were terminated by the fatal battle of Hadrianople We might censure the vices of his style the disorder and perplexity of his narrative but we must now take leave of this impartial historian and reproach is silenced by our regret for such an irreparable loss  the emperor Valens  Battle of Hadrianople A D Aug th  leaving under a strong guard his baggage and military treasure marched from Hadrianople to attack the Goths who were encamped about twelve miles from the city  The difference of the eight miles of Ammianus and the twelve of Idatius can only embarrass those critics Valesius ad loc who suppose a great army to be a mathematical point without space or dimensions  By some mistake of the orders or some ignorance of the ground the right wing or column of cavalry arrived in sight of the enemy whilst the left was still at a considerable distance the soldiers were compelled in the sultry heat of summer to precipitate their pace and the line of battle was formed with tedious confusion and irregular delay The Gothic cavalry had been detached to forage in the adjacent country and Fritigern still continued to practise his customary arts He dispatched messengers of peace made proposals required hostages and wasted the hours till the Romans exposed without shelter to the burning rays of the sun were exhausted by thirst hunger and intolerable fatigue The emperor was persuaded to send an ambassador to the Gothic camp the zeal of Richomer who alone had courage to accept the dangerous commission  was applauded and the count of the domestics adorned with the splendid ensigns of his dignity had proceeded some way in the space between the two armies when he was suddenly recalled by the alarm of battle The hasty and imprudent attack was made by Bacurius the Iberian who commanded a body of archers and targetteers and as they advanced with rashness they retreated with loss and disgrace In the same moment the flying squadrons of Alatheus and Saphrax whose return was anxiously expected by the general of the Goths descended like a whirlwind from the hills swept across the plain and added new terrors to the tumultuous but irresistible charge of the Barbarian host The event of the battle of Hadrianople so fatal to Valens and to the empire may be described in a few words  The defeat of the Romans  the Roman cavalry fled the infantry was abandoned surrounded and cut in pieces The most skilful evolutions the firmest courage are scarcely sufficient to extricate a body of foot encompassed on an open plain by superior numbers of horse but the troops of Valens oppressed by the weight of the enemy and their own fears were crowded into a narrow space where it was impossible for them to extend their ranks or even to use with effect their swords and javelins In the midst of tumult of slaughter and of dismay the emperor deserted by his guards and wounded as it was supposed with an arrow sought protection among the Lancearii and the Mattiarii who still maintained their  ground with some appearance of order and firmness His faithful generals Trajan and Victor who perceived his danger loudly exclaimed that all was lost unless the person of the emperor could be saved Some troops animated by their exhortation advanced to his relief they found only a bloody spot covered with a heap of broken arms and mangled bodies without being able to discover their unfortunate prince either among the living or the dead Their search could not indeed be successful if there is any truth in the circumstances with which some historians have related the death of the emperor By the care  Death of the emperor Valens  of his attendants Valens was removed from the field of battle to a neighbouring cottage where they attempted to dress his wound and to provide for his future safety But this humble retreat was instantly surrounded by the enemy they tried to force the door they were provoked by a discharge of arrows from the roof till at length impatient of delay they set fire to a pile of dry faggots and consumed the cottage with the Roman emperor and his train Valens perished in the flames and a youth who dropt from the window alone escaped to attest the melancholy tale and to inform the Goths of the inestimable prize which they had lost by their own rashness A great number of brave and distinguished officers perished in the battle of Hadrianople which equalled in the actual loss and far surpassed in the fatal consequences the misfortune which Rome had formerly sustained in the  fields of Cannae  Nec ullâ annalibus praeter Cannensem pugnam ita ad internecionem res legitur gesta Ammian xxxi According to the grave Polybius no more than horse and foot escaped from the field of Cannae were made prisoners and the number of the slain amounted to horse and foot Polyb l iii p edit Casaubon in vo Livy xxii is somewhat less bloody he slaughters only horse and foot The Roman army was supposed to consist of effective men xxii  Two mastergenerals of the cavalry and infantry two great officers of the palace and thirtyfive tribunes were found among the slain and the death of Sebastian might satisfy the world that he was the victim as well as the author of the public calamity Above twothirds of the Roman army were destroyed and the darkness of the night was esteemed a very favourable circumstance as it served to conceal the flight of the multitude and to protect the more orderly retreat of Victor and Richomer who alone amidst the general consternation maintained the advantage of calm courage and regular discipline  We have gained some faint light from Jerom tom i p and in Chron p Victor in Epitome Orosius l vii c p Jornandes c Zosimus l iv p Socrates l iv c Sozomen l vi c Idatius in Chron But their united evidence if weighed against Ammianus alone is light and unsubstantial    While the impressions of grief and terror were  Funeral oration of Valens and his army  still recent in the minds of men the most celebrated rhetorician of the age composed the funeral oration of a vanquished army and of an unpopular prince whose throne was already occupied by a stranger  There are not wanting says the candid Libanius those who arraign  the prudence of the emperor or who impute the public misfortune to the want of courage and discipline in the troops For my own part I reverence the memory of their former exploits I reverence the glorious death which they bravely received standing and fighting in their ranks I reverence the field of battle stained with  their  blood and the blood of the Barbarians Those honourable marks have been already washed away by the rains but the lofty monuments of their bones the bones of generals of centurions and of valiant warriors claim a longer period of duration The king himself fought and fell in the foremost ranks of the battle His attendants presented him with the fleetest horses of the Imperial stable that would soon have carried him beyond the pursuit of the enemy They vainly pressed him to reserve his important life for the future service of the republic He still declared that he was unworthy to survive so many of the bravest and most faithful of his subjects and the monarch was nobly buried under a mountain of the slain Let none therefore presume to ascribe the victory of the Barbarians to the fear the weakness or the imprudence of the Roman troops The chiefs and the soldiers were animated by the virtue of their ancestors whom they equalled in discipline and the arts of war Their generous emulation was supported by the love of glory which prompted them to contend at the same  time with heat and thirst with fire and the sword and cheerfully to embrace an honourable death as their refuge against flight and infamy The indignation of the gods has been the only cause of the success of our enemies  The truth of history may disclaim some parts of this panegyric which cannot strictly be reconciled with the character of Valens or the circumstances of the battle but the fairest commendation is due to the eloquence and still more to the generosity of the sophist of Antioch  Libanius de ulciscend Julian Nece c in Fabricius Bibliot Graec tom vii p    The pride of the Goths was elated by this memorable  The Goths besiege Hadrianople  victory but their avarice was disappointed by the mortifying discovery that the richest part of the Imperial spoil had been within the walls of Hadrianople They hastened to possess the reward of their valour but they were encountered by the remains of a vanquished army with an intrepid resolution which was the effect of their despair and the only hope of their safety The walls of the city and the rainparts of the adjacent camp were lined with military engines that threw stones of an enormous weight and astonished the ignorant Barbarians by the noise and velocity still more than by the real effects of the discharge The soldiers the citizens the provincials the domestics of the palace were united in the danger and in the defence the surious assault of the Goths was repulsed their secret arts of treachery and treason were discovered  and after an obstinate conflict of many hours they retired to their tents convinced by experience that it would be far more adviseable to observe the treaty which their sagacious leader had tacitly stipulated with the fortifications of great and populous cities After the hasty and impolitic massacre of three hundred deserters an act of justice extremely useful to the discipline of the Roman armies the Goths indignantly raised the siege of Hadrianople The scene of war and tumult was instantly converted into a silent solitude the multitude suddenly disappeared the secret paths of the woods and mountains were marked with the footsteps of the trembling fugitives who sought a refuge in the distant cities of Illyricum and Macedonia and the faithful officers of the household and the treasury cautiously proceeded in search of the emperor of whose death they were still ignorant The tide of the Gothic inundation rolled from the walls of Hadrianople to the suburbs of Constantinople The Barbarians were surprised with the splendid appearance of the capital of the East the height and extent of the walls the myriads of wealthy and affrighted citizens who crowded the ramparts and the various prospect of the sea and land While they gazed with hopeless desire on the inaccessible beauties of Constantinople a sally was made from one of the gates by a party of Saracens  Valens had gained or rather purchased the friendship of the Saracens whose vexatious inroads were felt on the borders of Phoenicia Palestine and Egypt The

conflagrations and above all the profanation of the churches that were turned into stables and the contemptuous treatment of the relics of holy martyrs But the Saint is surely transported beyond the limits of nature and history when he affirms  that in those desert countries nothing was left except the sky and the earth that after the destruction of the cities and the extirpation of the human race the land was overgrown with thick forests and inextricable brambles and that the universal desolation announced by the prophet Zephaniah was accomplished in the scarcity of the beasts the birds and even of the fish  These complaints were pronounced about twenty years after the death of Valens and the Illyrian provinces which were constantly exposed to the invasion and passage of the Barbarians still continued after a calamitous period of ten centuries to supply new materials for rapine and destruction Could it even be supposed that a large tract of country had been left without cultivation and without inhabitants the consequences might not have been so fatal to the inferior productions of animated nature The useful and feeble animals which are nourished by the hand of man might suffer and perish if they were deprived of his protection but the beasts  of the forest his enemies or his victims would multiply in the free and undisturbed possession of their solitary domain The various tribes that people the air or the waters are still less connected with the fate of the human species and it is highly probable that the fish of the Danube would have felt more terror and distress from the approach of a voracious pike than from the hostile inroad of a Gothic army  Whatever may have been the just measure of  Massacre of the Gothic youth in Asia A D  the calamities of Europe there was reason to fear that the same calamities would soon extend to the peaceful countries of Asia The sons of the Goths had been judiciously distributed through the cities of the East and the arts of education were employed to polish and subdue the native fierceness of their temper In the space of about twelve years their numbers had continually increased and the children who in the first emigration were sent over the Hellespont had attained with rapid growth the strength and spirit of perfect manhood  Eunapius in Excorpt Legat p foolishly supposes a praeternatural growth of the young Goths that he may introduce Cadmus's armed men who sprung from the dragon's teeth c Such was the Greek eloquence of the times  It was impossible to conceal from their knowledge the events of the Gothic war and as those daring youths had not studied the language of dissimulation they betrayed their wish their desire perhaps their intention to emulate the glorious example of their fathers The danger of the times seemed to justify the jealous suspicions of the provincials  and these suspicions were admitted as unquestionable evidence that the Goths of Asia had formed a secret and dangerous conspiracy against the public safety The death of Valens had left the East without a sovereign and Julius who filled the important station of mastergeneral of the troops with a high reputation of diligence and ability thought it his duty to consult the senate of Constantinople which he considered during the vacancy of the throne as the representative council of the nation As soon as he had obtained the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most expedient for the good of the republic he assembled the principal officers and privately concerted effectual measures for the execution of his bloody design An order was immediately promulgated that on a stated day the Gothic youth should assemble in the capital cities of their respective provinces and as a report was industriously circulated that they were summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands and money the pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment and perhaps suspended the motions of the conspiracy On the appointed day the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth was carefully collected in the square or Forum the streets and avenues were occupied by the Roman troops and the roofs of the houses were covered with archers and slingers At the same hour in all the cities of the East the signal was given of indiscriminate slaughter and the provinces of Asia were delivered by the cruel prudence of  Julius from a domestic enemy who in a few months might have carried fire and sword from the Hellespont to the Euphrates  Ammianus evidently approves this execution efficacia velox et salutaris which concludes his work xxxi Zosimus who is curious and copious l iv p mistakes the date and labours to find the reason why Julius did not consult the emperor Theodosius who had not yet ascended the throne of the East  The urgent consideration of the public safety may undoubtedly authorise the violation of every positive law How far that or any other consideration may operate to dissolve the natural

colleague had been slain in battle and that twothirds of the Roman army were exterminated by the sword of the victorious Goths Whatever resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his uncle might deserve the resentment of a generous mind is easily subdued by the softer emotions of grief and compassion and even the sense of pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration of the state of the republic Gratian was too late to assist he was too weak to revenge his unfortunate colleague and the valiant and modest youth felt himself unequal to the support of a sinking world A formidable tempest of the Barbarians of Germany seemed ready to burst  over the provinces of Gaul and the mind of Gratian was oppressed and distracted by the administration of the Western Empire In this important crisis the government of the East and the conduct of the Gothic war required the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman A subject invested with such ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a distant benefactor and the Imperial council embraced the wise and manly resolution of conferring an obligation rather than of yielding to an insult It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the purple as the reward of virtue but at the age of nineteen it is not easy for a prince educated in the supreme rank to understand the true characters of his ministers and generals He attempted to weigh with an impartial hand their various merits and defects and whilst he checked the rash confidence of ambition he distrusted the cautious wisdom which despaired of the republic As each moment of delay diminished something of the power and resources of the future sovereign of the East the situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate The choice of Gratian was soon declared in favour of an exile whose father only three years before had suffered under the sanction of  his  authority an unjust and ignominious death The great Theodosius a name celebrated in history

Augustin  was summoned  to the Imperial court which had gradually retreated from the confines of Thrace to the more secure station of Sirmium Five months after the death of Valens the emperor Gratian produced before the assembled troops  his  colleague and  their  master who after a modest perhaps a sincere resistance was compelled to accept amidst the general acclamations the diadem the purple

Africa have formed one of the most splendid parts of the annals of Valentinian The son of that general who likewise bore the name of Theodosius was educated by skilful preceptors in the liberal

education of Alexander Hannibal and the second Africanus who like him had served under their fathers xii  Under the standard of such a leader young Theodosius sought glory and knowledge in the most distant scenes of military action inured his constitution to the difference of seasons and climates distinguished his valour by sea and land and observed the various warfare of the Scots the Saxons and the Moors His own merit and the recommendation of the conqueror of Africa soon raised him to a separate command and in the station of Duke of Maesia he vanquished an army of  Sarmatians saved the province deserved the love of the soldiers and provoked the envy of the court  Ammianus xxix mentions this victory of Theodosius Junior Dux Maesiae primâ etiam tum lanugine juvenis princeps postea perspectissimus The same fact is attested by Themistius and Zosimus but Theodoret l v c who adds some curious circumstances strangely applies it to the time of the Interregnum  His rising fortunes were soon blasted by the disgrace and execution of his illustrious father and Theodosius obtained as a favour the permission of retiring to a private life in his native province of Spain He displayed a firm and temperate character in the ease with which he adapted himself to this new situation His time was almost equally divided between the town and country the spirit which had animated his public conduct was shewn in the active and affectionate performance of every social duty and the diligence of the soldier was profitably converted to the improvement of his ample patrimony  Pacatus in Panegyr Vet xii prefers the rustic life of Theodosius to that of Cincinnatus the one was the effect of choice the other of poverty  which lay between Valladolid and Segovia in the midst of a fruitful district still famous for a most exquisite breed of sheep  M d'Anville Geographie Ancienne tom i p has fixed the situation of Caucha or Coca in the old province of Gallicia where Zosimus and Idatius have placed the birth or patrimony of Theodosius  From the innocent but humble labours of his farm Theodosius was transported in less than four months to the throne of the Eastern empire and the whole period of the history of the world will not perhaps afford a  similar example of an elevation at the same time so pure and so honourable The princes who peaceably inherit the sceptre of their fathers claim and enjoy a legal right the more secure as it is absolutely distinct from the merits of their personal characters The subjects who in a monarchy or a popular state acquire the possession of supreme power may have raised themselves by the superiority either of genius or virtue above the heads of their equals but their virtue is seldom exempt from ambition and the cause of the successful candidate is frequently stained by the guilt of conspiracy or civil war Even in those governments which allow the reigning monarch to declare a colleague or a successor his partial choice which may be influenced by the blindest passions is often directed to an unworthy object But the most suspicious malignity cannot ascribe to Theodosius in his obscure solitude of Caucha the arts the desires or even the hopes of an ambitious statesman and the name of the Exile would long since have been forgotten if his genuine and distinguished virtues had not left a deep impression in the Imperial court During the season of prosperity he had been neglected but in the public distress his superior merit was universally felt and acknowledged What confidence must have been reposed in his integrity since Gratian could trust that a pious son would forgive for the sake of the republic the murder of his father What expectations must have been formed of his abilities to encourage the hope that a single man could save and restore  the empire of the East Theodosius was invested with the purple in the thirtythird year of his age The vulgar gazed with admiration on the manly beauty of his face and the graceful majesty of his person which they were pleased to compare with the pictures and medals of the emperor Trajan whilst intelligent observers discovered in the qualities of his heart and understanding a more important resemblance to the best and greatest of the Roman princes  It is not without the most sincere regret that  His prudent and successful conduct of the Gothic war A D  I must now take leave of an accurate and faithful guide who has composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary Ammianus Marcellinus who terminates his useful work with the defeat and death of Valens recommends the more glorious subject of the ensuing reign to the youthful vigour and eloquence of the rising generation  Let us hear Ammianus himself Haec ut miles quondam et Graecus a principatu Caesaris Nervae exorsus adusque Valentis interitum pro virium explicavi mensurâ nunquam ut arbitror sciens silentio ausus corrumpere vel mendacio Scribant reliqua potiores aetate doctrinisque florentes Quos id si libuerit aggressuros procudere linguas ad majores moneo stilos Ammian xxxi The first thirteen books a superficial epitome of two hundred and fiftyseven years are now lost the last eighteen which contain no more than twentyfive years still preserve the copious and authentic history of his own times  The rising generation was not disposed to accept his advice or to imitate his example  Ammianus was the last subject of Rome who composed a profane history in the Latin language The East in the next century produced some rhetorical historians Zosimus Olympiodorus Malchus Candidus c See Vossius de Historicis Graecis l ii c de Historicis Latinis l ii c c  and in the study  of the reign of Theodosius we are reduced to illustrate the partial narrative of Zosimus by the obscure hints of fragments and chronicles by the figurative style of poetry or panegyric and by the precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical writers who in the heat of religious faction are apt to despise the profane virtues of sincerity and moderation Conscious of these disadvantages which will continue to involve a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman empire I shall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps Yet I may boldly pronounce that the battle of Hadrianople was never revenged by any signal or decisive victory of Theodosius over the Barbarians and the expressive silence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the observation of the condition and circumstances of the times The fabric of a mighty state which has been reared by the labours of successive ages could not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the calamity The loss of forty thousand Romans who fell in the plains of Hadrianople might have been soon recruited in the populous provinces of the East which contained so many millions of inhabitants The courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest and most common quality of human nature and sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions If the Barbarians were mounted on the horses  and equipped with the armour of their vanquished enemies the numerous studs of Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons of cavalry the thirtyfour arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with magazines of offensive and defensive arms and the wealth of Asia might still have yielded an ample fund for the expences of the war But the effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians and of the Romans extended the victory of the former and the defeat of the latter far beyond the limits of a single day A Gothic chief was heard to declare with insolent moderation that for his own part he was fatigued with slaughter but that he was astonished how a people who fled before him like a flock of sheep could still presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and provinces  Chrysostom tom i p edit Montfaucon I have verified and examined this passage but I should never without the aid of Tillemont Hist des Emp tom v p have detected an historical anecdote in a strange medley of moral and mystic exhortations addressed by the preacher of Antioch to a young widow  The same terrors which the name of the Huns had spread among the Gothic tribes were inspired by the formidable name of the Goths among the subjects and soldiers of the Roman empire  Eunapius in Excerpt Legation p  If Theodosius hastily collecting his scattered forces had led them into the field to encounter a victorious enemy his army would have been vanquished by their own fears and his rashness could not have been excused by the chance of  success But the  great  Theodosius an epithet which he honourably deserved on this momentous occasion conducted himself as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic He fixed his headquarters at Thessalonica the capital of the Macedonian diocese  See Godefroy's Chronology of the Laws Codex Theodos tom i Prolegomen p xcixciv  from whence he could watch the irregular motions of the Barbarians and direct the operations of his lieutenants from the gates of Constantinople to the shores of the Hadriatic The fortifications and garrisons of the cities were strengthened and the troops among whom a sense of order and discipline was revived were insensibly emboldened by the confidence of their own safety From these secure stations they were encouraged to make frequent sallies on the Barbarians who infested the adjacent country and as they were seldom allowed to engage without some decisive superiority either of ground or of numbers their enterprises were for the most part successful and they were soon convinced by their own experience of the possibility of vanquishing their  invincible  enemies The detachments of these separate garrisons were gradually united into small armies the same cautious measures were pursued according to an extensive and wellconcerted plan of operations the events of each day added strength and spirit to the Roman arms and the artful diligence of the emperor who circulated the most favourable reports of the success of the war  contributed to subdue the pride of the Barbarians and to animate the hopes and courage of his subjects If instead of this faint and imperfect outline we could accurately represent the counsels and actions of Theodosius in four successive campaigns there is reason to believe that his consummate skill would deserve the applause of every military reader The republic had formerly been saved by the delays of Fabius and while the splendid trophies of Scipio in the field of Zama attract the eyes of posterity the camps and marches of the Dictator among the hills of Campania may claim a juster proportion of the solid and independent fame which the general is not compelled to share either with fortune or with his troops Such was likwise the merit of Theodosius and the infirmities of his body which most unseasonably languished under a long and dangerous disease could not oppress the vigour of his mind or divert his attention from the public service  Most writers insist on the illness and long repose of Theodosius at Thessalonica Zosimus to diminish his glory Jornandes to favour the Goths and the ecclesiastical writers to introduce his baptism    The deliverance and peace of the Roman provinces  Divisions

Theodosius was seconded  by fortune and the emperor never failed to seize and to improve every favourable circumstance As long as the superior genius of Fritigern preserved the union and directed the motions of the Barbarians their power was not inadequate to the conquest of a great empire The death of that hero the predecessor and master of the renowned Alaric relieved an impatient multitude from the intolerable yoke of discipline and discretion The Barbarians who had been restrained by his authority abandoned themselves to the dictates of their passions and their passions were seldom uniform or consistent An army of conquerors was broken into many disorderly bands of savage robbers and their blind and irregular fury was not less pernicious to themselves than to their enemies Their mischievous disposition was shewn in the destruction of every object which they wanted strength to remove or taste to enjoy and they often consumed with improvident rage the harvests or the granaries which soon afterwards became necessary for their own subsistence A spirit of discord arose among the independent tribes and nations which had been united only by the bands of a loose and voluntary alliance The troops of the Huns and the Alani would naturally upbraid the flight of the Goths who were not disposed to use with moderation the advantages of their fortune the ancient jealousy of the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths could not long be suspended and the haughty chiefs still remembered  the insults and injuries which they had reciprocally offered or sustained while the nation was seated in the countries beyond the Danube The progress of domestic faction abated the more diffusive sentiment of national animosity and the officers of Theodosius were instructed to purchase with liberal gifts and promises the retreat or service of the discontented party The acquisition of Modar a prince of the royal blood of the Amali gave a bold and faithful champion to the cause of Rome The illustrious deserter soon obtained the rank of mastergeneral with an important command surprised an army of his countrymen who were immersed in wine and sleep and after a cruel slaughter of the astonished Goths returned with an immense spoil and four thousand waggons to the Imperial camp  Zosimus l iv p styles him a Scythian a name which the more recent Greeks seem to have appropriated to the Goths  In the hands of a skilful politician the most different means may be successfully applied to the same ends and the peace of the empire which had been forwarded by the divisions was accomplished by the reunion of the Gothic nation Athanaric who had been a patient  Death and funeral of Athanaric A D Jan  spectator of these extraordinary events was at length driven by the chance of arms from the dark recesses of the woods of Caucaland He no longer hesitated to pass the Danube and a very considerable part of the subjects of Fritigern who already felt the inconveniencies of anarchy were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their  king a Gothic Judge whose birth they respected and whose abilities they had frequently experienced But age had chilled the daring spirit of Athanaric and instead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory he wisely listened to the fair proposal of an honourable and advantageous treaty Theodosius who was acquainted with the merit and power of his new ally condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles from Constantinople and entertained him in the Imperial city with the confidence of a friend and the magnificence of a monarch  The Barbarian prince observed with curious attention the variety of objects which attracted his notice and at last broke out into a sincere and passionate exclamation of wonder I now behold said he what I never could believe the glories of this stupendous capital and as he cast his eyes around he viewed and he admired the commanding situation of the city the strength and beauty of the walls and public edifices the capacious harbour crowded with innumerable vessels the perpetual concourse of distant nations and the arms and discipline of the troops Indeed continued Athanaric the emperor of the Romans is a god upon earth and the presumptuous man who dares to lift his hand against him is guilty of his own blood  The reader will not be displeased to see the original words of Jornandes or the author whom he transcribed Regiam urbem ingressus est miransque En inquit cerno quod saepe incredulus audiebam famam videlicet tantae urbis Et huc illuc oculos volvens nunc situm urbis commeatumque navium nunc moenia clara prospectans miratur populosque diversarum gentium quasi fonte in uno e diversis partibus scaturiente undâ sic quoque militem ordinatum aspiciens Deus inquit est sine dubio terrenus Imperator et quisquis adversus eum manum moverit ipse sui sanguinis reus existit Jornandes c xxviii p proceeds to mention his death and funeral    The  Gothic king did not long enjoy this splendid and honourable reception and as temperance was not the virtue of his nation it may justly be suspected that his mortal disease was contracted amidst the pleasures of the Imperial banquets But the policy of Theodosius derived more solid benefit from the death than he could have expected from the most faithful services of his ally The funeral of Athanaric was performed with solemn rites in the capital of the East a stately monument was erected to his memory and his whole army won by the liberal courtesy and decent grief of Theodosius enlisted under the standard of the Roman empire  Jornandes c xxviii p Even Zosimus l iv p is compelled to approve the generosity of Theodosius so honourable to himself and so beneficial to the public  The submission of so great a body of the Visigoths was productive of the most salutary consequences and the mixed influence of force of reason and of corruption became every day more powerful and more extensive Each independent chieftain hastened to obtain a separate treaty from the apprehension that an obstinate delay might expose  him  alone and unprotected to the revenge or justice of the conqueror The general or rather  the final capitulation of the Goths may be dated four years one month and twentyfive days after the defeat and death of the emperor Valens  The short but authentic

Alatheus and Saphrax whose restless spirit had prompted them to seek new scenes of rapine and glory Their destructive course was pointed towards the West but we must be satisfied with a very obscure and imperfect knowledge of their various adventures The Ostrogoths impelled several of the German tribes on the provinces of Gaul concluded and soon violated a treaty with the emperor Gratian advanced into the unknown countries of the North and after an interval of more than four years returned with accumulated force to the banks of the Lower Danube Their troops were recruited with the fiercest warriors of Germany and Scythia and the soldiers or at least the historians of the empire no longer recognised the name and countenances of their former enemies  Zosimus l iv p  The general who commanded the military and naval powers of the Thracian frontier soon perceived that his superiority would be disadvantageous to the public service and that the Barbarians awed  by the presence of his fleet and legions would probably defer the passage of the river till the approaching winter The dexterity of the spies whom he sent into the Gothic camp allured the Barbarians into a fatal snare They were persuaded that by a bold attempt they might surprise in the silence and darkness of the night the sleeping army of the Romans and the whole multitude was hastily embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes  I am justified by reason and example in applying this Indian name to the  of the Barbarians the single trees hollowed into the shape of a boat  Zosimus l iv p  Ausi Danubium quondam

the remainder of their subjects and soldiers and the women and children securely followed in the rear One of the nights without a moon had been selected for the execution of their design and they had almost reached the southern bank of the Danube in the firm confidence that they should find an easy landing and an unguarded camp But the progress of the Barbarians was suddenly stopped by an unexpected obstacle a triple line of vessels strongly connected with each other and which formed an impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river While they struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict their right flank was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of gallies which  were urged down the stream by the united impulse of oars and of the tide The weight and velocity of those ships of war broke and sunk and dispersed the rude and feeble canoes of the Barbarians their valour was ineffectual and Alatheus the king or general of the Ostrogoths perished with his bravest troops either by the sword of the Romans or in the waves of the Danube The last division of this unfortunate fleet might regain the opposite shore but the distress and disorder of the multitude rendered them alike incapable either of action or counsel and they soon implored the clemency of the victorious enemy On this occasion as well as on many others it is a difficult task to reconcile the passions and prejudices of the writers of the age of Theodosius The partial and malignant historian who misrepresents every action of his reign affirms that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle till the Barbarians had been vanquished by the valour and conduct of his lieutenant Promotus  Zosimus l iv p He too frequently betrays his poverty of judgment by disgracing the most serious narratives with trifling and incredible circumstances  The flattering poet who celebrated in the court of Honorius the glory of the father and of the son ascribes the victory to the personal prowess of Theodosius and almost insinuates that the king of the Ostrogoths was slain by the hand of the emperor  Odothaei Regis  opima  Retulit  Ver The  opima  were the spoils which a Roman general could only win from the king or general of the enemy whom he had slain with his own hands and no more than three such examples are celebrated in the victorious ages of Rome    The truth of history might perhaps be found in a just medium between these extreme and contradictory assertions  The original treaty which fixed the settlement  Settlement of the Goths in Thrace and Asia A D  of the Goths ascertained their privileges and stipulated their obligations would illustrate the history of Theodosius and his successors The series of their history has imperfectly preserved the spirit and substance of this singular agreement  See Themistius Orat xvi p Claudian in Eutrop l ii mentions the Phrygian colony  Ostrogothis colitur mistisque Gruthungis  Phryx ager  and then proceeds to name the rivers of Lydia the Pactolus and Hermus  The ravages of war and tyranny had provided many large tracts of fertile but uncultivated land for the use of those Barbarians who might not disdain the practice of agriculture A numerous colony of the Visigoths was seated in Thrace the remains of the Ostrogoths were planted in Phrygia and Lydia their immediate wants were supplied by a distribution of corn and cattle and their future industry was encouraged by an exemption from tribute during a certain term of years The Barbarians would have deserved to feel the cruel and perfidious policy of the Imperial court if they had suffered themselves to be dispersed through the provinces They required and they obtained the sole possession of the villages and districts assigned for their residence they still cherished and propagated their native manners and language asserted in the bosom of despotism the freedom of  their domestic government and acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperor without submitting to the inferior jurisdiction of the laws and magistrates of Rome The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families were still permitted to command their followers in peace and war but the royal dignity was abolished and the generals of the Goths were appointed and removed at the pleasure of the emperor An army of forty thousand Goths was maintained for the perpetual service of the empire of the East and those haughty troops who assumed the title of  Foederati  or allies were distinguished by their gold collars liberal pay and licentious privileges Their native courage was improved by the use of arms and the knowledge of discipline and while the republic was guarded or threatened by the doubtful sword of the Barbarians the last sparks of the military flame were finally extinguished in the minds of the Romans  Compare Jornandes c xx who marks the condition and number of the Gothic  Foederati  with Zosimus l iv p who mentions their golden collars and Pacatus in Panegyr Vet xii who applauds with false or foolish joy their bravery and discipline  Theodosius had the address to persuade his allies that the conditions of peace which had been extorted from him by prudence and necessity were the voluntary expressions of his sincere friendship for the Gothic nation  Amator pacis generisque Gothorum is the praise bestowed by the Gothic historian c xxix who represents his nation as innocent peaceable men slow to anger and patient of injuries According to Livy the Romans conquered the world in their own defence  A different mode of vindication  or apology was opposed to the complaints of the people who loudly censured these shameful and dangerous concessions  Besides the partial invectives of Zosimus always discontented with the Christian reigns see the grave representations which Synesius addresses to the emperor Arcadius de Regno p edit Petav The philosophic bishop of Cyrene was near enough to judge and he was sufficiently removed from the temptation of fear or flattery  The calamities of the war were painted in the most lively colours and the first symptoms of the return of order of plenty and security were diligently exaggerated The advocates of Theodosius could affirm with some appearance of truth and reason that it was impossible to extirpate so many warlike tribes who were rendered desperate by the loss of their native country and that the exhausted provinces would be revived by a fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen The Barbarians still wore an angry and hostile aspect but the experience of past times might encourage the hope that they would acquire the habits of industry and obedience that their manners would be polished by time education and the influence of Christianity and that their posterity would insensibly blend with the great body of the Roman people  Themistius Orat xvi p composes an elaborate and rational apology which is not however exempt from the puerilities of Greek rhetoric Orpheus could  only  charm the wild beasts of Thrace but Theodosius enchanted the men and women whose predecessors in the same country had torn Orpheus in pieces c    Notwithstanding these specious arguments and  Their hostile sentiments  these sanguine expectations it was apparent to every discerning eye that the Goths would long remain the enemies and might soon become the  conquerors of the Roman empire Their rude and insolent behaviour expressed their contempt of the citizens and provincials whom they insulted with impunity  Constantinople was deprived half a day of the public allowance of bread to expiate the murder of a Gothic soldier  was the guilt of the people Libanius Orat xii p edit Morel  To the zeal and valour of the Barbarians Theodosius was indebted for the success of his arms but their assistance was precarious and they were sometimes seduced by a treacherous and inconstant disposition to abandon his standard at the moment when their service was the most essential During the civil war against Maximus a great number of Gothic deserters retired into the morasses of Macedonia wasted the adjacent provinces and obliged the intrepid monarch to expose his person and exert his power to suppress the rising flame of rebellion  Zosimus l iv p He tells a long and ridiculous story of the adventurous prince who roved the country with only five horsemen of a spy whom they detected whipped and killed in an old woman's cottage c  The public apprehensions were fortified by the strong suspicion that these tumults were not the effect of accidental passion but the result of deep and premeditated design It was generally believed that the Goths had signed the treaty of peace with an hostile and insidious spirit and that their chiefs had previously bound themselves by a solemn and secret oath never to keep faith with the Romans to maintain the fairest shew of loyalty and friendship and to watch the favourable moment of rapine of conquest  and of revenge But as the minds of the Barbarians were not insensible to the power of gratitude several of the Gothic leaders sincerely devoted themselves to the service of the empire or at least of the emperor the whole nation was insensibly divided into two opposite factions and much sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute to compare the obligations of their first and second engagements The Goths who considered themselves as the friends of peace of justice and of Rome were directed by the authority of Fravitta a valiant and honourable youth distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the politeness of his manners the liberality of his sentiments and the mild virtues of social life But the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithless Priulf who inflamed the passions and asserted the independence of his warlike followers On one of the solemn festivals when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the Imperial table they were insensibly heated by wine till they forgot the usual restraints of discretion and respect and betrayed in the presence of Theodosius the fatal secret of their domestic disputes The emperor who had been the reluctant witness of this extraordinary controversy dissembled his fears and resentment and soon dismissed the tumultuous assembly Fravitta alarmed and exasperated by the insolence of his rival whose departure from the palace might have been the signal of a civil war boldly followed him and drawing his  sword laid Priulf dead at his feet Their companions flew to arms and the faithful champion of Rome would have been oppressed by superior numbers if he had not been protected by the seasonable interposition of the Imperial guards  Compare Eunapius in Excerpt Legat p with Zosimus l iv p The difference of
