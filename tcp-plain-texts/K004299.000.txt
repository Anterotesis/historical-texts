Oxford's lasting shame  Whom none but Coxcombs scorn but Fools defame  Eternal war with dulness born to wage  Thou Paracelsus of this wondrous age  BEDDOES the philosophic Chymist's Guide  The Bigot's Scourge of Democrats the Pride  Accept this lay and to thy Brother Friend  Or name more dear a Sans Culotte attend  While in Rhyme's Galligaskins I enclose  The broad posteriors of thy brawny prose  And sing by thee inspir'd in tuneful strain  The blest return of Saturn's golden reign  Oh had I silly swain the force and fire  Of some whom Frenchmen's bloody deeds inspire  Could I ascending on the wing of sound  Pleas'd with the grand the lofty and profound  Rise above mortal ken in rapturous glow  Leaving poor pursy Sense to pant below  Could I for ever studious to refine  Prank with my pearly phrase each pretty line  Or like an empty Bottle deep immers'd  Whence Bubbles after Bubbles bustling burst  Amus'd to view my noisy nothings swell  In the sweet vanity of thought excel  Now bursting o'er the bounds of vulgar Rhyme  Gracefully great and terribly sublime  Trolling in fulltoned melody along  With all the clattering clang of modern song  I'd hail the progress of those blissful days  When fair Philosophy's meridian rays  Shall brighten Nature's face shall drive the Moles  Of blinking Error to their secret holes  Disperse the darkness of primaeval Night  And bid a new Creation rise to light  Proceed great days and bring oh bring to view  Things strange to tell Incredible but true  Behold behold the Golden Age appears  Skip skip ye Mountains Forests lend your Ears  See redcapt Liberty from heaven descend  And real Prodigies her steps attend  Nec  varios  discet  mentiri  lana  colores  Ipse sed in pratis  Aries  jam  suavè rubenti  Murice  jam  croceo  mutabit vellera luto  Sponte suâ  sandyx  pascentes vestiet agnos  VIRGIL  No more immers'd in many a foreign dye  Shall British wool be taught to blush and lie  But all our pastures glow with purple Rams  With scarlet Lambkins and their yellow Dams  The renovation of the world under the benign influence of French Freedom has been long foretold by prophets of every description by some who manufacture verses others who manufacture cotton by maudling Mrs's and mincing Misses by enlightened Lawyers and more enlightened Physicians but by none more fully expected more ardently longed for than by  Dr Beddoes  and  A Gentleman of Pembroke College Oxford to whom Dr Beddoes addresses a late elaborate work  appellation  his "  Dear Giddy  " The great Dr assures us that not only science in general will shortly advance towards perfection but that in particular "a new Medicine will arise from the ashes of the old with healing in its wings" How this revolution is to be effected we are informed in the dedication of his Observations on Calculus c p "We are just beginning to catch a glimpse of the laws of animal Nature  and now when the human mind seems in so many countries  be roused from that torpor by which it has so long been benumbed we may reasonably indulge the expectation of a rapid progress in this the most beneficial of all the sciences  An infinitely small portion of genius has hitherto been exerted to diminish the sum of our painful sensations  and the force of society has been exclusively at the disposal of Despots and Juntos the great Artificers of human Evil Should an entire change in these two respects any where take place every member of society might soon expect to experience in his own person the consequence of so happy an innovation and should the example be generally  there is no improvement in the condition of the World for which we might not  from the bloodless rivalship of Nations  " But we are told that the same influence of Liberty and Genius will not only in other respects effect equal wonders but produce greater blessings "We know" exclaims this egregious Chymist "that vegetables are capable of forming oils either exactly the same as those of Animals or very nearly resembling them Thus we have the suet of the Croton Sebiferum the butter of the Phoenix Dactylifera and of the Butyrum Cacao  When from a more intimate acquaintance with them we shall be better able to apply the Laws of organic bodies to the accommodation as well as preservation of Life may we not by regulating the vegetable functions teach our woods and hedges to supply us with Butter and Tallow  " Observations on Calculus c p  No more the lazy Ox shall gormandize  And swell with fattening grass his monstrous size  No more trot round and round the groaning field  But tons of Beef our loaded Thickets yield  The patient DairyMaid no more shall learn  With tedious toil to whirl the frothy Churn  But from the Hedges shall her Dairy fill  As pounds of Butter in big drops distil  The sottish Jews who in a God believ'd  And sometimes blessings oftener plagues receiv'd  Shouted a Miracle when on the ground  Their boasted bread the greedy grumblers found  By no dry crusts shall Infidels be fed  Our soil producing Butter to our Bread  See reverend Thames who God of Rivers reigns  And winds meand'ring through our richest plains  To treat the Cits that many a sixpence give  Once in a week like Gentlemen to live  Resign his majesty of mud and stream  O'er strawberry beds in deluges of  Cream  See Tallow Candles tip the modest Thorn  Candles of Wax the prouder Elm adorn  See the dull Clown survey with stupid stare  Where Leaves once grew now periwigs of Hair  While fluids which a wondrous change betray  Ooze from the vernal bud the summer spray  Differing from animals alone in name  As Botanists already half exclaim  See plants susceptible of joy and woe  Feel all we feel and know whate'er we know  View them like us inclin'd to watch or sleep  Like us to smile and ah like us to weep  Like us behold them glow with warm desire  And catch from Beauty's glance celestial fire  Then oh ye fair if through the shady grove  Musing on absent Lovers you should rove  And there with tempting step all heedless brush  Too near some wanton metamorphos'd Bush  Or only hear perchance the western breeze  Steal murmuring through the animated Trees  Beware beware lest to your cost you find  The Bushes dangerous dangerous too the Wind  Lest ah too late with shame and grief you feel  What your fictitious Pads would ill conceal  While Plants turn Animals Man happy Man  "If this supposition were just might not some means be discovered to protract the period of Youth and Vigour  indefinitely  Whether true or false and even though we should never be able to restore new excitability to the system there can be no doubt of the immediate practicability of prolonging Life considerably and what is much more desirable of maintaining a firmer state of Health"  Observations on Calculus  c p "Nor however remote Medicine may be at present from such perfection do I see any reason to doubt that by taking advantage of various and continual accessions as they accrue to Science the same power may be acquired over living as is at present exercised over some inanimate bodies and that not only the cure and prevention of diseases but  the art of protracting the fairest season of Life    and rendering Health more vigorous  will one day half realize the dream of Alchemy"  Beddoes's Letter to Darwin  p  To ages shall extend Life's lengthen'd span  Bane to our bliss no more the wrinkled face  Beauty's bewitching circles shall disgrace  But see the reigning Toast half kind half coy  Her Rivals' envy and her Lover's Joy  Skill'd to allure to charm us and beguile  In all the bloom of Eighty sit and smile  Thus shall each Belle a lovely L'ENCLOS prove  Drive Boys of future Cent'ries mad with love  The Marriage Table its degrees extend  And to our great great Grandmother ascend  Poor POPE who griev'd "that Life could scarce supply  "More than to look about him and to die"  Had he but flourish'd in these Halcyon days  Might long have bid Life's little Candle blaze  Have grown strait handsome brisk and debonnair  The Muses' favourite favourite of the Fair  Happy the Poet's lot who can prolong  Till time shall be no more his deathless song  And live himself to see his swelling name  Roll like a Snowball gathering all its fame  Happy thrice happy he who at his will  Can drink of Life's sweet cup his constant fill  Dr Beddoes in a little tract addressed to the Author of this Epistle entertains us with a long history of how he made himself very lean very fair his complexion having been before of an uniform brown very pretty and very consumptive by the use of a certain "Cosmetic" called  Oxygenous Air  and how he afterwards cured himself of the said Leanness and Consumption at his Friend's Quaker Reynolds's in Colnbrook Dale by a diet in which  Butter and Cream  bore the largest proportions See pages and  Who if excess of Oxygene create  Symptoms which lean Consumption indicate  A sure specific can procure with ease  Rich Cream and Butter from his herd of Trees  Or if he find excess of  To prevent our Sailors from growing fat and afterwards falling into the Scurvy of which Obesity we are informed is the first symptom Dr Beddoes proposes that the jolly Tars should eat their food  raw Observations  p  Hydrogene  His body load with fat his mind with spleen  True health and vigour to restore can take  From some regenerate Oak a savoury steak  Sliced off the slaughter'd Monster's quondam stump  Converted now into a real Rump  And blest with an accommodating maw  Devour the luscious bit red recent raw  Now rise my Muse and warm with rapture dart  From Men to Manners "Fancy to the Heart"  Transporting sight to view the Sons of Pride  Their little heads with shame and sorrow hide  Ranks and Distinctions cease all reeking lie  In the mean muck of low Equality  Favourites of freedom Sons of frisky France  Who never learnt like British Bears to dance  And while their Premier's humdrum Bagpipes sound  Led by the nose jog growling round and round  But more like Monkeys airy light and gay  Pleas'd on your Master's head to skip and play  Ye pious Atheists Moralists who deem  The Christian's Heaven and Hell an idle Dream  Delighted to deride all vulgar fears  Of Beelzebub's black Claws cropt Tail and Ears  With manly Scorn and Dignity to tread  On prostrate Superstition's hoary head  Who foes to Power Despotic dare defy  The King of Kings that Bugbear of the sky  Dreading for present crimes no future rod  Selfpraise your worship Vanity your God  Oh how my Eyes with tears ecstatic fill  What new felt transports through my bosom thrill  When I behold you with gigantic blow  The pigmy pride of Royalty lay low  With pikes and guns this moral dogma teach  Virtue consists in nudity of Breech  Soon shall we view no more the glittering Things  Bestarr'd begarter'd and befool'd by Kings  The pretty Twinklers that so sweetly shone  And deem'd their lovely lustre all their own  No more the Despot view whose mighty nods  Shook nature and proclaim'd him God of Gods  Drunk with applause who rais'd his rolling Eyes  And seem'd whene'er he mov'd to tread the skies  Despis'd detested all shall wing their flight  And sink no more to rise in endless night  Arm'd with a bristled End and glittering Awl  Behold a minor Monarch in his Stall  No circling Gold his royal brow surrounds  A Yard of Room his sphere of Action bounds  His sole ambition and his prime pursuit  With skill a Shoe to patch to stitch a Boot  Nor deem his fate severe The time may come  When many a pious King in Christendom  Dash'd from his throne and made Dame Fortune's Fool  Shall envy little Capet's cobbling stool  Mark with the Peer and Prince the * canting Priest  Forbidden on his Country's fat to feast  "It is a law of human Nature the less of ecclesiastical influence the less of deadly animosity among Men""It is reasonable to presume that the majority of French Priests in England partake of the Spirit of their Brethren and to a large portion of the popish Priesthood Christianity is believed  upon good grounds  to be as much  foolishness  as it was to the Greeks Their faith in the advantages of the immense emoluments which those  Reverend Robbers  their predecessors had extorted from superstitious Barbarians never suffered any abatement hence probably that conduct to which their sufferings are to be imputed""Through all the calumny that has been vomited forth against the French the most injured and most enlightened people upon Earth it is easy to discern  some  advantages which the Nation owes to LibertyTythes  the accursed relic of Popery  have been abolishedFrance is purged not only from  Ecclesiastical Drones  which consumed the sweetest honey of the hive but also from the monstrous debauchery of the richer and the beggarly insolence of the poorer Noblesse"Dr Beddoes's admirable  Reasons for believing the friends of Liberty in France not to be the Authors or Abettors of the crimes committed in that Country humbly addressed to those who from time to time constitute themselves Judges and Jury upon affairs public and private and without admitting any testimony but the gross lies of Beldame Rumour damn their Neighbours individually and the rest of the World by the Lump  the celebrated Hand bill circulated in Shropshire which eventually occasioned his resignation of the Chemical Chair in the University of Oxford  While peace looks down sweet smiling on the swains  And untax'd Plenty crowns the fruitful plains  No more that lazy Lubbard shall we pay  With phiz so farcical to preach and pray  No more behold that Harpy of the land  Lay on our largest sheaves his greedy hand  With Bigotry's black banner wide unfurl'd  Fright into Gothic Ignorance the world  But Truth and Light shall come with hostile rage  "To drive the holy Vandal off the stage"  See Tythes expire and ancient Slavery fail  Proud Superstition turn her vanquish'd tail  No zealous Minister the Church befriend  But all her sorceries with the Beldame end  Lo Babylon is fallen That mystic  That Sink of Wickedness is now no more  Great Babylon is fallen Shout shout ye Meads  And oh ye Cornfields wave your happy heads  Ye lovely Lambkins strain your feeble voice  And with your Dams in loudest Baas rejoice  Calves join your notes to swell the gladdening sound  Cows let your lowings from the skies rebound  Prolific Ducks quack mid the mighty noise  Hens more prolific cackle out your joys  And ye oh Swine lift up your little Eyes  With rapture riot round your rotten Styes  Stretch your triumphant throats and strive to make  The frighten'd welkin with your Gruntings shake  FINIS
