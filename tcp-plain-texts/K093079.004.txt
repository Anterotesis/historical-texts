 A COLLECTION of POEMS  VOL IV  A COLLECTION OF POEMS IN FOUR VOLUMES  BY SEVERAL HANDS  LONDON Printed for G PEARCH N  o  CHEAPSIDE MDCCLXX  Isaac Taylor del et sculp  THE VALETUDINARIAN AN ODE  SAID TO BE WRITTEN BY DR MARRIOTT  INHERITANCE of weak but proud Mortality  Hence Disease and pining Pain  With all your pale and ghastly train  Tossings dire heartpiercing Moans  Sighs and Tears and hollow Groans  The harbingers of Death  Whether ye be  The spawn of bloated Luxury  Or of the pestilential breath  Of Eurus bred or from the eastern clime  Hence to your ancient seat  Where ebbing Nilus leaves his putrid slime  To Volga's banks retreat  Or to the Caspian or Bengala's bay  From Britain's happy lands  Haste to Arabian sands  While winds sulphureous burn and urge your way  But Goddess of the dimpled cheek  Whom the wanton Cupids seek  Come fair Health to grace the song  Bring the chearful Muse along  Bring laughing Youth who looks behind  Love on Fancy's breast reclin'd  Wit no poison'd dart who flings  Or but retorts when Envy stings  Come with antic Merriment  And the placid child Content  All with happy steps advance  Join the song and lead the dance  Oft O Goddess let thy feet  Visit this my lone retreat  Where my oak extends its pride  Of twisted arms and fit to ride  Sublime on Neptune's swelling wave  Now the roaring winds doth brave  Where the vine's soft tendrils run  And swell to meet the southern sun  Where Contemplation wont to stray  Winds thro' the wood her easy way  Or marks the lake the field or sky  The silent Angler's stedfast eye  The Gunner's aim or Industry  Who with his loud resounding blow  Lays the nodding forest low  Or teaches where to wind the stream  Or whistles to his labouring team  The meads which suck the dews of morn  Or uplands crown'd with golden corn  Richer than Iberia's mine  The bleating flocks the lowing kine  The smoking cots and pointed spires  The setting sun's reflecting fires  Woods dark waving in the dale  Rays which gleam and clouds which sail  Shades and lights by turns contending  Gradual colours softly blending  All as Nature's pencil clear  Marks the variegated year  These O Goddess these are thine  Offspring of immortal line  Who with mortals deign'st to dwell  In some low and rural cell  To haunt the brink of tinkling rills  The flowery vales or sloping hills  And when the plowman turns the soil  To chear his song and guide his toil  With vest succinct in Dian's train  Oft art thou seen to brush the plain  While thy shrill horns sweet Echo rouse  Slumbering on the mountain's brows  Oft when Winter clouds the air  To the blazing hearth repair  Thy social feet wheree'er the bowl  Of moderate Mirth unlocks the soul  When tales of time and ancient fear  Suspend the young astonish'd ear  Or carrols quaint in longdrawn note  Swell the rustic's ample throat  Or where high lifted steps resound  When the peasant thumps the ground  With aukward heel and gives a fall  To mistress of the rural ball  Or presses with his iron hand  And whirls her thro' the shouting band  Nor art thou wont with these to sport  Alone but where the Loves resort  With all the young and shining train  Of Cytherea's golden reign  More elegant to lead is thine  The dance which waves its easy line  Marks the graceful and the strong  Where speech to which no words belong  Makes love by actions never pain'd  All oppos'd but nought constrain'd  Movements mixing swift and slow  And foot ear eye together go  Thus flush'd with all thy native charms  My Delia spreads her winning arms  Uplisted soft and seems to tread  On yielding air or ocean's bed  And as she grants her modest hand  Damon's happy eyes demand  While mov'd by her he seems to live  The heart which she half seems to gives  If these delights O Goddess wait  Ever on thy happy state  Best of blessings understood  Only source of mortal good  Hither bright Hygeia fly  With rosy cheek and sparkling eye  Such as thou dost oft appear  When thy Heberden is near  Rich with Nature's genuine grace  Come Goddess to my warm embrace  Far from all I fear or hate  From splendid life's delusive state  Smiles that stab or that betray  Gloom of heart with visage gay  Splender canker'd with distress  Grandeur mix'd with littleness  Words of wind and hopes of air  Clouds which threaten dark despair  Craft disloyal to his trust  Here High Birth licking low the dust  There upstart Meanness set astride  The world too narrow for his pride  Far from Trade's too busy seat  Of Loss and Gain the low deceit  Aukward Pomp and Vanity  Who restless drive and mount the sky  Proud of misus'd Liberty  While sordid Cunning Passion blind  Ride on the gilded car behind  From Law's grimace and mean chicane  Which rivets when it seems the chain  To loose receives the golden shower  And offers hecatombs to Power  From language low which vulgars prize  Creeping Arts which mean to rise  Labyrinths which ever wind  In the dark and double mind  From Profession's learned scene  Cant of words which little mean  Physic child of Luxury  Clok'd in shallow mystery  False Religion's forms which bind  The body to enslave the mind  Disputation's rage and trouble  Philosophic system's bubble  From War's parade or Eloquence  In senates big with smooth pretence  Of public good from Envy mean  Who midst the liberal Arts is seen  Corrodes the page which Genius drew  And turns aside her sullen view  Each work of Merit pleas'd to blast  Then feeds upon herself at last  From these immortal Goddess fly  And bless thy humble votary  Give me Reason's lasting pleasure  Ease but not ignoble leisure  Far be wild Ambition's fires  Hopeless Love and fierce Desires  I ask not Fortune's glittering charms  The pride of courts the spoils of arms  By silver stream and haunted grove  O give my peaceful steps to rove  Beneath the shade of pendent hills  I'll listen to the falling rills  That chafe the pebble as they stray  And haste like human life away  Then on the flowery carpet green  I'll sit and trace the rural scene  While by the mimic pencil drawn  The herds shall seem to crop the lawn  The piping swain the distant towers  The mossgrown knotted oaks and bowers  As bending to the whispering breeze  Some thatch'd cot rising 'mong the trees  In rude and artless lines design'd  Shall faintly mark the Master's mind  Or if soft verse delight us more  O grant of verse the wonderous power  Strong ideas to inspire  Words which paint and sounds which fire  Which calls up shades of heroes bold  Whose virtues warm'd the times of old  Dressing the historic page  With Terror Pity Love and Rage  Or gives to Truth the tuneful art  With moral song to mend the heart  Flow it easy soft and free  From illconceiv'd obscurity  Affectation's crowded plumes  All that strains or that assumes  Nature may it e'er pursue  Describing as we feel the true  Her magic glass while Fancy brings  Which shews the fleeting form of things  Each fair assemblage knows to trace  All that Nature hath of Grace  While Reason lends her sacred aid  And in the beautiful display'd  Sees with sound philosophy  The reflected Deity  Thus on thro' Manhood Youth and Age  Nor stain'd with guilt nor rough with rage  In smooth maeanders life shall glide  And roll a clear and peaceful tide  THE ROYAL VOYAGE  BY THE SAME  I  HIGH on the bounding bark the Royal Fair  Mounts o'er the billows of the watery way  Serene as Cynthia thro' the fields of air  Queen of the Night extends her cloudless ray  When all the forests tremble to the gleam  And the transparent seas reflect the silver beam  But see the whitening surge the gathering clouds  Hark the winds whistle thro' the shrowds  They bow the mast they rend the sail  The seaworn mariner is pale  And views the blackening storm and hears th' increasing gale  But not O Royal Maid  Let Fear thy breast invade  Know happy Fair approv'd by heaven  To thee the empire of the Main is given  In vain loud winds the deep deform  Love shall triumphant ride the storm  Peace every roaring child of troubled air  Unmov'd the Queen of seagirt Albion sings  Her flying fingers touch the strings  Around their Queen the trembling train repair  Her courage lifts their own  Her music sooths their care  II  Happy Queen of Albion's isle  On whom the Loves and Graces smile  Haste from Germania's plain and deathdevoted shore  Soon thy weary steps shall try  A happier land a milder sky  Where no din of arms shall roar  Nor winds nor swelling seas assault thee more  Thus 'midst the storms which blow  O'er Thracian hills of snow  Orpheus tun'd the golden lyre  And saw the beasts of death retire  Thus fearless of the night and watery grave  Leander's bosom met the wave  While Love before him flew his way to guide  And thro' the foaming tide  Gave to his nervous arm redoubled power  While Hymen shook the torch bright on the distant tower  Hail happy fires of mutual love unknown  To purchas'd dalliance and tumultuous joy  True Pleasure sits on Virtue's awful throne  There all the Loves their golden shafts employ  Mild and unclouded the eternal flame  Reward of virtuous Love and Heaven's best blessing came  III  Swift the wing'd Hours shall urge their stealing way  Nor oft the waning moon shall know decay  Ere a new race shall rise of scepter'd kings  From thee Strelisian Fair the future hero springs  See the long lines of royal youths extend  To Britain's throne new subjects bend  Where'er her glittering standards rise  In other seas in other skies  Shall spread the godlike fame of mildest victories  Auspicious youths be born  Arise O haste your native soil adorn  Not valorous arms alone  Shall guard the regal throne  But shining arts and holy laws  And ancient Freedom's welldefended cause  Shall lift secure your praise sublime  Thro' all the radiant paths of time  On Dorubernian cliffs the Muse hath told  Prophetic child of Druids old  Whereon she sits and hears from either pole  In every wind victorious thunders roll  ODE ON DEATH WRITTEN IN FRENCH BY HIS MAJESTY THE KING OF PRUSSIA  TRANSLATED BY THE SAME  WHAT does the sad presaging mean  Few days few years perhaps few moments urge  My footsteps to the dreary verge  Where Fate the curtain drops to close the scene  Then farewel Life and Light and thou blest Sun serene  Earth o'er me rolls thy mighty bed  The world recedes I view the grave profound  Of life I touch the utmost bound  And rush to mix a victim with the dead  Where Fate embraces all and none can backward tread  While yet I wake or sleep there stand  Ten thousand Deaths in arms before behind  They press me round and every wind  Wafts the contagion from each distant land  And all the Elements conspire to arm the dreadful band  Within without above below  By turns they sink or rend my feeble frame  Now chill now urge the vital flame  Till Nature's tortur'd stream forgets to flow  And Art itself but proves a still more dangerous foe  Dust to its Dust will soon return  This mortal part proud Tyrant of the Mind  Nor leave of all its pomp behind  But horrid lessons human Pride should learn  Foul Worms and Blood and Stench that sill the Royal Urn  Recede ye base and servile train  I cannot be the mighty thing ye say  The wretched object of a day  Which slatter'd Fancy would exalt in vain  I know what I must be and what I am disdain  But warm'd with Heaven's eternal flame  Shall that which lives which thinks the Mind  Be fleeting as the empty wind  Or say can Death its active efforts tame  O God who first inspir'd this animated frame  No for the Mind above the grave  Unfetter'd springs and searching Nature's stores  It knows itself and thee adores  Secure O God whose word its being gave  That what created first has certain power to save  While thus of Death dispels the cloud  Can sensual joy life's narrow view confine  True Virtue feels the hope divine  Of bliss sincere not so the guilty crowd  Thy arm for ever blasts the wicked and the proud  Great God and is eternal pain  Or joy of Heaven reserv'd for me in store  Thy breath but wafts to either shore  Scarce can the tortur'd mind the thought sustain  I fly forbidden joys the sensual and the vain  Yet fast to earth is Nature bound  Back on its wonted objects turns the Mind  And lags the slave of life behind  While Reason's efforts are too painful found  To rend the rooted oak that loves its native ground  Objects of every jealous eye  Ye dreams of mortal good that swift decay  How do ye stop my destin'd way  And force me back the paths of sense to try  Ye point the sting of Death and more than once I die  Scenes of astonishment the world how blind  Is Death depriv'd of all his mighty power  Do none expect the fatal hour  Is there a wish to Nature's bounds confin'd  Is there a scheme forgot or toil for this resign'd  See Mortals still acquire assume  As if more vigilant they Death could shun  To honours fly to combats run  And he whose footsteps tremble o'er the tomb  Builds up new plans of life and sudden meets his doom  Rush on ye madding train  A thousand rocks a thousand storms despise  To reach the good ye idolize  Go of accumulated wealth be vain  Go ravage other worlds if other worlds remain  Let neither law nor power divine  Nor Nature's anxious Monitor within  Repress each greatly daring Sin  Go bid with want the plunder'd Orphan pine  And with polluted hands disturb each sacred Shrine  Proceed but soon your views are past  Accurst at once ye droop and are no more  Who would not think to see your store  That all the projects your Ambition cast  Beyond the grave were stretch'd and would for ever last  Ye mighty Leaders mighty Kings  With flames and blood whose battles mark your way  Do Monarchs hope eternal sway  In vain each distant clime its tribute brings  Sprung from the dust ye mix with longforgotten things  Himself the Victor cannot save  If but to die is yours how short is Glory's sum  In vain ye fought and overcome  Nor aught avail the spoils Ambition gave  To hang with conquer'd crowns the putrid Monarch's grave  On Nature's theatre display'd  All is the sport of Death the change I fear  New objects rise then disappear  Around my brows the cypress casts a shade  I scorn the sweets of life and all its roses fade  Yet 'midst this sage but painful lore  While awful truths their sacred light reveal  What means this latent wish I feel  Is then my bosom's Lord itself no more  Wretch that I drag new chains more ponderous than before  Rules then the mind this Lord supreme  Which every weak and vain allurement draws  To Pleasure's throne and tyrant laws  Quick we return in life from what we seem  To what we are and wake from calm Reflection's dream  As wandering Fancy leads we go  By turns we reason or submit to sense  And incoherent parts commence  That fill the stage of Folly Shame and Woe  Nor from the hook escap'd again the bait we know  Voltaire in this eternal round  How swift our active spirits urge their way  By both extremes deceiv'd we stray  Now caught by sense now lost in thought profound  And in the mutual change our happiness is found  INSCRIPTION UPON A MONUMENT  BY THE SAME  HOW soon with nimble wings our pleasures haste  And clouds involve the sunshine of the day  The wintry storms howl o'er the dreary waste  And fairest things tend swiftest to decay  In dark oblivion all our glory ends  This morn we flourish and the next we fade  Time lifts his sweeping scythe the pile descends  Where vain Ambition all her toils display'd  The work of nations and the pomp of power  Sink the once lofty spire the dome's proud state  The dust receives them at the destin'd hour  And mighty kingdoms feel the force of Fate  Fall vain Ambition's pile and lofty spires  But spare stern Fate the youthful and the gay  Soft pity sure such innocence requires  And so much beauty well might Death delay  TO A LADY SITTING FOR HER PICTURE  BY THE SAME  THE weary look desponding air  Ill suits my Dear a face so fair  Resume your smiles again supply  The Graces caught by Fancy's eye  While Wilson sketches out the piece  We'll talk to pass the time of Greece  Of Greece as you have often heard  For warriors and for wits rever'd  The seat of Learning and the Graces  Fam'd for fine arts but finer faces  Where Painters Poets not as since  Were greater held than any Prince  In temples palaces carest  None more the Ladies smiles possest  For they were rich as well as clever  And riches were successful ever  Priests Senates Nations Kings desir'd  The works their heaventaught art inspir'd  And if a pencil chanc'd to drop  An Alexander pick'd it up  Beauties would run to be sketch'd over  The haughty Prince tho' much a lover  Once for the copy payment small  Resign'd up the original  The fair Campaspé's matchless charms  More conquering than the Monarch's arms  To one Apelles one who drew  The Queen of Love as Wilson you  Each lovely maid of Greece the toast  Such as our British isle can boast  In all their native beauty gay  As Hebé young and sweet as May  Before him sate from one he chose  The eye which Love half seem'd to close  This lent a face divinely fair  A mild and yet majestic air  That gave what art in vain would seek  The spirits mantling in the cheek  And lips that softness seem'd to speak  Thus from their various charms combin'd  One perfect Whole imprest his mind  But had Apelles painted now  He might my Dear have copied you  And as in truth I think was done  He would have from the picture run  And left the Venus but begun  To sacrifice the pride of art  To the bright Goddess of his heart  And given up an immortal claim  For beauty's prize the prize of fame  ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY  BY THE SAME  YES it is past the fatal stroke is given  Our pious sorrows own the hand of heaven  How short our joys incumber'd life how vain  Still vex'd with evil's neverceasing train  While roll the hours which lead each fleeting year  Each asks a sigh and each demands a tear  O'er pleasing scenes the mind with rapture roves  Grasps in idea all its hopes or loves  Snatch'd from its view the pleasing scenes decay  And the fair vision melts in shades away  Of youth of beauty and of wit the boast  O lov'd for ever and too early lost  Sweet maid for thee now mingling with the dead  Her sacred griefs the tuneful Muse shall shed  The soft remembrance of thy charms to save  She plants with all her bays thy hallow'd grave  Ye too companions of her happier days  Heirs of her charms and rivals of her praise  Amid the circles of the young and gay  Your years unheeded urge their stealing way  While mixt with pleasure's eversmiling train  Ye know no sorrows and ye feel no pain  Yet when no more the pulse tumultuous beats  Nor the pleas'd sense each flattering tale repeats  Let calm reflection the sad moral teach  That bliss below evades our eager reach  That virtue only grants the real charm  Gives wit to win and beauty power to warm  And tho' like hers whose recent fate we mourn  And ask your pity for a sister's urn  Your beauties shine in all their bloom confest  'Mid gazing slaves contending to be blest  Yet think like hers may soon those beauties fade  Like hers your glories in the dust be laid  Time's hardy steps in silence swift advance  Dim the bright ray that darts the fiery glance  And Age dread herald of Death's awful reign  Blasts every grace and freezes every vein  When with a mother's joy a mother's fear  The thoughtful parent dropt the silent tear  Gaz'd on her child and saw new beauties rise  Glow in her cheeks and sparkle in her eyes  In expectation plann'd each hope of life  The sister daughter mother friend and wife  Ah fleeting joys how soon those hopes were o'er  We doom'd to mourn and she to charm no more  The waning moon shall fill her wasted horn  And nature's radiance gild the orient morn  The smiling spring with charms renew'd appear  The sleeping blossoms haste to deck the year  But bloom no more this fair departed flower  Nor wak'd by genial sun nor vernal shower  How vain alas was all thy father's art  Vain were the sighs which swell'd thy mother's heart  Again I see thee just expiring lie  Pale thy cold lip half clos'd thy languid eye  Thy guardian Innocence beside thee stands  And patient Faith uplifts her holy hands  Teach thee with smiles to meet the stroke of Death  Calm all thy pangs and ease thy struggling breath  Resign'd dear maid to earth's maternal breast  May sister Seraphs chant thy soul to rest  There shall the constant Amaranthus bloom  And wings of Zephyrs shed the morn's perfume  O'er thy sad hearse fair emblems of the dead  By virgin hands are dying lilies shed  The weeping Graces shall thy tomb surround  The Loves with broken darts shall strew the ground  In vain for thee they wak'd the fond desires  Wove myrtle wreaths and fann'd their purer fires  The youthful God who joins the nuptial bands  In vain expecting near his altar stands  Fate spread the cloud his torch extinct he flies  And veils with saffron robe his streaming eyes  Yet O while crown'd with neverfading flowers  Thy spirit wanders thro' Elysian bowers  If plaintive sounds of mortal grief below  Reach the blest seats and waft our tender woe  Hear happy shade while thus our mortal lays  This monument of soft affection raise  By gentle ties of kindred birth allied  The Muse that sports on Camus' willow'd side  In Memory's lofty dome inscribes thy name  And with thy beauties strives to mix her fame  THE ACADEMIC  WRITTEN APRIL MDCCLV  At the time of the establishment of Classical Prizes and building the new Public Library    BY THE SAME  I  WHILE silent streams the mossgrown turrets lave  Cam on thy banks with pensive steps I tread  The dipping osiers kiss thy passing wave  And evening shadows o'er the plains are spread  From restless eye of painful Care  To thy secluded grot I fly  Where Fancy's sweetest forms repair  To soothe her darling Poesy  Reclin'd the lovely Visionary lies  In yonder vale and laurelvested bower  Where the gay turf is deck'd with various dies  And breathes the mingling scents of every flower  While holy dreams prolong her calm repose  Her pipe is cast the whispering reeds among  High on the boughs her waving harp is hung  Murmuring to every wind that o'er it blows  II  Oft' have I seen her bathe at dewy morn  Her wanton bosom in thy silver spring  And while her hands her flowing locks adorn  With busy elegance have heard her sing  But say what long recorded theme  Thro' all the lofty tale of time  More worthy can the Goddess deem  Of sounding chords and song sublime  Than whose parental hand to vigour bred  Each infant art the Noble and the Wise  Whose bounty gave yon' arching shades to spread  Yon' pointed spires in holy pomp to rise  Shall War alone loudechoing numbers claim  And shall the deeds of smiling Peace be drown'd  Amid the Hero's shouts and trumpet's sound  These too shall flourish in immortal fame  III  When Science sled from Latium's polish'd coasts  And Grecian groves her long and lov'd abode  Far from the din of fierce conflicting hosts  Thro' barbarous realms the weary wanderer trod  But to what more indulgent sky  To what more hospitable shade  Could trembling bleeding fainting fly  The helpless and devoted Maid  Timehonour'd Founders ye the virgin woo'd  'Twas yours with souls to native grandeur born  To bid her radiant beauties shine renew'd  With wealth to heap with honours to adorn  In Granta's happier paths she wept no more  Heal'd were the wounds that scarr'd her gentle breast  Here still she smiles with Freedom's sons to rest  Nor mourns her Attic towers nor Tuscan shore  IV  Fathers of Genius whom the Muse adores  For sure to you her noblest strains belong  Beneath whose venerable roofs she pours  The grateful notes of sweetly flowing song  Th' increase of swift revolving years  With conscious pride exulting view  How all ye plann'd complete appears  How all your Virtues bloom anew  The generous zeal which erst ye felt remains  Its bounteous beams still ardent to dispense  While unexhausted to your learned plains  Rolls the rich stream of wide munificence  Joy to your shades the great career is run  Reserv'd by Fate for some superior hand  Confest the last th' auspicious work shall stand  And Statesman Monarch end what ye begun  V  Ye too once Inmates of these walls renown'd  Whose spirits mingling with th' ethereal ray  Of universal Nature trac'd the bound  Or rais'd in majesty of thought the lay  See your lov'd Arts this clime to grace  Their rival radiance brighter shed  While Holles smiles the wreath to place  Upon the youthful Victor's head  Where Spencer sits among your thrones sublime  To the soft music of his mournful lays  Listening ye weep for his ungrateful time  And point the better hope of happier days  If with the dead dishonour's memory dies  Forget much injur'd Name th' unworthy woe  In strains like thine so may our accents flow  In nobler numbers yon' fair domes arise  VI  When Faction's storms or some fell Tyrant's hate  Arts join'd with Freedom to one grave shall doom  Then tho' these structures to the hand of Fate  Bend their proud height like thine imperial Rome  Know vainly Time thy rapid rage  Shall point its wide destroying aim  Since what defies the force of age  Thus consecrates the pile to Fame  Some future eye the ruin'd heap shall trace  The name of Holles on the stone behold  Shall point a Brunswic to a distant race  Benign and awful on the swelling gold  Th' historic page the poet's tuneful toil  With these compar'd their mutual aid shall raise  To build the records of eternal praise  And deck with endless wreaths their honour'd soil  VII  Sweeter than warbled sounds that win the sense  Flows the glad music of a grateful heart  Beyond the pomp of wordy eloquence  Or strains too cold highwrought with labour'd art  Tho' weakly sounds the jarring string  Tho' vainly would the Muse explore  The heights to which with eagle wing  Alone can heaventaught Genius soar  Yet shall her hand ingenious strive to twine  The blooming chaplet for her Leader's brow  While with new verdure grac'd in Glory's shrine  The ampler Palms of civic Honours grow  When he these favour'd shades appears to bless  Whose guardian counsels guide a nation's fate  And with superior toils for Europe's state  Mixes the thought of Granta's happiness  VIII  Hail seats rever'd where thoughtful pleasures dwell  And hovering Peace extends her downy wings  Where musing Knowledge holds her humble cell  And Truth divine unlocks her secret springs  This verse with mild acceptance deign  To hear this verse yourselves inspire  Ere yet within your sacred fane  The Muse suspends her votive lyre  Thee Granta thus with filial thanks I greet  With smiles maternal thou those thanks receive  For Learning's humble wealth for friendship sweet  For every calmer joy thy scenes could give  While thus I sport upon thy peaceful strand  The storms of life at awful distance roar  And still I dread still lingering on the shore  To launch my little bark and quit the land  AMABELLA  The subject of this poem is founded on a circumstance that happended during the late warA young lady not meeting with the concurrence of her relations in favour of an officer for whom she expressed her regard was prevailed upon by his solicitations to consent to a clandestine marriage which took place on the day he sat out to join his regiment abroad where he was unfortunately killed in an engagement    WRITTEN BY THE DESIRE OF MRS MONTAGU  BY MR JERNINGHAM  HARMODIUS breath'd the rural air nor found  His ruddy health with length of years decrease  By duty prompted Amabella crown'd  His silver forehead with the wreath of peace  By partial nature fram'd in beauty's mould  Adorn'd with every grace unspoil'd by art  To friendship's circle still did she unfold  The lovelier beauties of a feeling heart  Endear'd to all she met each welcome day  By fortune's hand with various blessings fraught  When lo her gaiety's accustom'd ray  Was quench'd untimely with the gloom of thought  What fix'd the bosomthorn affliction knows  Where peace sat brooding as the gentle dove  What blasted on her cheek the summer rose  Or slow disease or unsuccessful love  Remain'd unknown'Twas by the many guess'd  That love to her soft vows had prov'd unkind  Beyond the power of her weak frame oppress'd  Infanity o'erthrew her lovely mind  At length recovering yet to grief devote  To solitude she gave th' unsocial day  Like a pale vot'ry from the world remote  Unchear'd unvisited of pleasure's ray  Oft did Harmodius at her state dismay'd  Solicit from his child her secret pain  Her vague reply still from his question stray'd  And each repeated effort prov'd in vain  To speed the moments of the loitering hour  And by their plaintive strains perchance allur'd  Within a spacious myrtlewoven bower  Two turtle doves the pensive fair secur'd  " Ye little captives would she often say  " Tho' here secluded from the fields of air  " Thro' yonder vernal grove forbid to stray  " And join the kindred train that wanton there  " 'Gainst you the gunner never lifts his arm  " Nor o'er this mansion does the falcon sail  " You live unconscious of the storm's alarm  " The rain impetuous and the beating hail  " Nor here by kind compassion unimpress'd  " The schoolboy ever rears his impious hand  " To fill with agony the feather'd breast  " And raze the little domes that love had plann'd"  Their harmless joys disease too soon effac'd  One fatal morn her Turturella's mate  She found with flagging wing subdued oppress'd  And just just sinking at the blow of fate  While down her cheek compassion's shower distill'd  She gently rais'd it to her anxious breast  But death's cold blast life's crimson current chill'd  And thus the fair her breathless bird address'd  " Illfated turtle round whose peaceful bower  " The jocund loves so lately wont to play  " How sunk alas in youth's exulting hour  " To fell disease to death th' untimely prey  " How silent is the voice which void of art  " Along the tender day was heard to coo  " How still how frozen is the constant heart  " Which to its dear companion beat so true  " That dear companion that now widow'd dove  " To screen from every harm be mine the care  " And while she mourns her ne'erreviving love  " Her grief to me the mourner will endear  " Like thee a widow too condemn'd to mourn  " No more to me does life unfold its charms  " Death death forbids him ever to return"  She saidand sunk into th' attendant's arms  Her swift relapsing to her former state  With boding fears approach'd the serving train  This scene's dread period tremblingly they wait  Nor were their boding fears indulg'd in vain  Awakening from her trance around she threw  Distressful fair her much disorder'd eyes  And wildering said"repeat that kind adieu  " Ah no from love to war to death he flies  " Did ye not hear the clash of hostile spears  " Ah mark ye not that breastplate stain'd with gore  " What groan was that which pierc'd these fearful ears  " He falls he fallsmy warrior is no more  " Nor was O Heaven his Amabella near  " To soothe his pain and echo sigh to sigh  " Drop on the gaping ground a balmy tear  " Kiss his cold lip and close his fading eye"  Of her distress th' alarm'd Harmodius taught  With trembling steps approach'd th' unconscious fair  " Give me he cried with grief paternal fraught  " Give me O Amabel' to soothe thy care  " Say what affliction has thy soul imprest  " Reveal what storm thy bosom'd calmness breaks  " Revealand thus relieve this anguish'd breast  " The tender father to his daughter speaks"  AMABELLA  " Ah what avails the praise the brave obtain  " Thro' his white bosom rush'd the hostile steel  " 'Twas his to swell the number of the slain  " And mine affliction's keenest point to feel"  HARMODIUS  " Her roving thought no trace of reason bears  " To her rack'd mind O Heaven thy peace impart  " A loving parent bathes thy cheek with tears  " Harmodius holds thee to his breaking heart"  AMABELLA  " To thee I grateful kneel O generous seer  " Who dost to one unknown thy care extend  " Along thy path may Peace her olives rear  " And Heaven in battle shield thy dearest friend  " For me who droop beneath misfortune's shower  " I had a fathernow alas a foe  " Thou'lt blush to hearin sorrow's darkest hour  " He leaves his child abandon'd to her woe  " But to thy heart that's fram'd of softer mould  " What can to thee a wretch like me endear  " The spring the motive of thy love unfold  " Say say for me why flows that friendly tear  " Yet soft awhilemethinks that hoary brow  " That plaintive voiceAh bear with my distress  " Or much remembrance is effac'd or now  " A tender father's teardew'd cheek I press"  HARMODIUS  " On knees of gratitude I bless the skies  " That Amabella to herself restore"  AMABELLA  " Ah wherefore dost thou joy thy daughter dies  " Support me to yon couchI can no more  " I feel I feel the pulse of life retire  " Ah deign to hear thy dying child reveal  " What in rebellion to thy just desire  " Lock'd in her breast she dar'd so long conceal  " By thee unsanction'd did I plight my love  " And all to

See vol  M A FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE  AS when diffus'd in solemn trance  Her dear delight the Latmian shepherd lay  Fond Cynthia came with lightningglance  And o'er his bosom stream'd her virgin ray  So come O gentle Muse if e'er aright  I paid my vows if e'er implor'd  One scanty beam of thy celestial light  Proof to the muckworm miser's golden hoard  Nor envious of the statesman's fair renown  The warrior's deathbought wreath and monarch's thorny crown  Come Guardian of my natal hour  That bad'st me chuse the still sequester'd grove  The pathless mead and woodbine bower  Where placid Cares and pensive Pleasures rove  Where oft by moonlight's silent solemn glade  Pale Passion musing loves to stray  And hand in hand by Melancholy led  In thoughtful loneness wears herself away  O come in all thy radiant charms confest  And fire with glowing zeal my fond devoted breast  I ask not flowrets fresh and gay  From Pindus cull'd to please the vainly great  No silken strain no tinsel lay  To cloke some public Knave from public hate  No Virgin noFair Freedom's vestal flame  Pervades my soul for Her I twine  The votive wreath for Her thy hallow'd name  Invoke O make thy choicest treasures mine  Breathe Inspiration thro' each glowing line  Thy genuine form impress and stamp the work divine  Then shalt thou George the song approve  O Britishborn O Freedom's sacred heir  O thou whom all the Graces love  Religion's boast and Virtue's darling care  Fain would the Muse attempt thy various praise  But ah in vainthro'  Theocr    Ida's bowers  With dubious foot th' astonish'd woodman strays  Where shall his work beginYe sylvan Powers  Direct the blow here oaks aspiring rise  There Monarchs of the grove tall cedars prop the skies  Say shall the Muse thy patriot Sire  Recall to view Tell how with conscious state  She saw the godlike Prince retire  To glorious exile like Timoleon great  Glad heard the voice "Avaunt ye wretched Train  " Shall I my Country's cause betray  " Betray my soul my God for sordid gain  " Perish the thoughtYe Slaves of gold away  " In venal courts tho' base corruption reigns  " Know Liberty shall breathe thro' Kew's indignant plains"  He spoke and lo the reptile crew  Struck dumb with wonder fledHail sacred source  Whence George his patriot morals drew  Prosper ye heavenly Powers their genial course  O bid them branch into a thousand rills  A thousand streamsWheree'er they flow  Whether all glift'ring down the loftier hills  Or thro' the still and humbler vales below  Let Health pursue no noxious weeds be found  But flowers immortal rise freshbreathing sweets around  Prophetic wishSee Discord flies  With all her rebel rout her hellborn train  See Faction falls and Party dies  They die fell serpents in his dawning reign  Thus sure presage of many a glorious deed  Blest omen of immortal fame  The Son of Jove when near his infant head  Devouring snakes in poisonous volumes came  Grasp'd in his brawny arms the scaly foes  Smil'd on the danger past and sunk to soft repose  And now again with careful hand  Her goodly plants fair Science joys to rear  And now again all blooming stand  The beauteous Progeny of Art they fear  No killing frosts no thick unkindly dews  Such as from Belgian plains arise  The genial clouds their pearly drops diffuse  And shower increase of sweetness from the skies  The youthful Sun in his meridian throne  Beams with indulgent ray his fostering influence down  Hail favour'd Isle blest seat of Fame  For conquering arms and peerless arts renown'd  Hail mighty George thy darling name  Oft shall the Muse with honest joy refound  Not that abstemious prudent just and wise  Thy every deed fair Virtue guides  Nor that thy thoughts with holy ardor rise  From Earth's low base where Vice and Passion bides  To Heaven's bright mansions there their sweets dispense  Grateful as hallow'd fumes from breathing frankincense  Ay me so great so bold a flight  Beseems not shepherdswain in lowly Mead  Far from Preferment's giddy height  Condemn'd alas an hireling flock to feed  Yet will I sing how thy discerning eye  The boisterous sea of life surveys  Where toiling fore the Sons of

bid the hills and dales the Song repeat  Your Patron your Augustus reigns  But hark with undulation soft and sweet  What melting music steals upon the ear  Am I deceiv'd or doth a Choir  Of winged Cupids fan the buxom air  Till Silence smiles while from their silver lyre  Harmonious numbers flow whose dulcet breath  Would recreate a soul beneath the pangs of death  I did not err a Choir of

me forth the crowded Town  To Turrick and the lonely Country down  To breathe from Chiltern Hills a purer air  For thousand's sakes may Heaven indulgent spare  Long long thy useful life and blessings crown  Thy healing arts while welldeserv'd renown  With wealth unenvied waits thy toil and care  And when this grateful heart shall beat no more  Nor long I ween can last my tottering frame  But soon

JOSEPH the worthy Son of worthy Sire  Who well repay'st thy pious parents care  To train thee in the ways of Virtue fair  And early with the love of Truth inspire  What farther can my closing eyes desire  To see but that by wedlock thou repair  The waste of death and raise a virtuous heir  To build our House e'er I in peace retire  Youth is the time for Love Then choose a Wife  With prudence

tender heart is wrung  With sad remembrance of her fickleness  Yet let not grief and heartconsuming care  Prey on your soul but let your constant mind  Bear up with strength and manly hardiness  Your

Aegyptians hid their wit  In hierolyphic dress  To give men pains in search of it  And please themselves with guess  Moderns to hit the selfsame path  And exercise their parts  Place figures in a room at Bath  Forgive them God of arts  Newton if I can judge aright  All Wisdom does express  His knowledge gives mankind delight  Adds to their happiness  Pope is the emblem of true Wit  The sunshine of the mind  Read o'er his works in search of it  You'll endless pleasure find  Nash represents man in the mass  Made up of Wrong and Right  Sometimes a K sometimes an A  Now blunt and now polite  The picture plac'd the bust between  Adds to the thought much strength  Wisdom and Wit are little seen  But Folly's at full length  ON THE DSS OF RD  BY THE SAME  WHAT do scholars and bards and astronomers wise  Mean by stuffing our heads with nonsense and lies  By telling us Venus must always appear  In a car or a shell or a twinkling star  Drawn by sparrows or swans or dolphins or doves  Attended in form by the graces and loves  That ambrosia and nectar is all she will taste  And her passport to hearts on a belt round her waist  Without all this bustle I saw the bright dame  To supper last night to Py's she came  In a good warm sedan no fine open car  Two chairmen her doves and a flambeau her star  No nectar she drank no ambrosia she eat  Her cup was plain claret a chicken her meat  Nor wanted a cestus her bosom to grace  For Rd that night had lent her her face  ARNO's VALE A SONG  BY THE DUKE OF DORSET  WHEN here Lucinda first we came  Where Arno rolls his silver stream  How brisk the nymphs the swains how gay  Content inspir'd each rural lay  The birds in livelier concert sung  The grapes in thicker clusters hung  All look'd as joy could never fail  Among the sweets of Arno's vale  But since the good Palemon died  The chief of shepherds and the pride  You read distress in every face  And joy to sorrow now gives place  The taste of pleasure now is o'er  Thy notes Lucinda please no more  The Muses droop and tears prevail  Adieu the sweets of Arno's vale  BRITAIN'S ISLE  ON THE DEATH OF FREDERIC PRINCE OF WALES  BY THE SAME  WHO but remembers yesterday  Remembers Britain happy gay  Each bard inspir'd with sprightlier lays  Already sung Saturnian days  Already Science hand in hand  With Art had Freedom's temple plann'd  All wore an universal smile  Such were the hopes of Britain's Isle  But now since Fate has wrapt in night  The nation's and mankind's delight  Since Frederic now for ever sleeps  Art droops again and Science weeps  Corruption who had spread her wing  To fly before the patriot King  Her flight now doubtful stops a while  Adieu the hopes of Britain's Isle  ODE TO MORNING  BY  THE sprightly messenger of day  To Heaven ascending tunes the lay  That wakes the blushing morn  Chear'd with th' inspiring notes I rise  And hail the power whose glad supplies  Th' enliven'd plains adorn  Far hence retire O Night thy praise  Majestic Queen in nobler lays  Already has been sung  When thine own spheres expire thy name  Secure from time shall rise in fame  Immortaliz'd by Young  See while I speak Aurora sheds  Her early honours o'er the meads  The springing valley's smile  With chearful heart the villageswain  Renews the labours of the plain  And meets the accustom'd toil  Day's monarch comes to bless the year  Wing'd Zephyrs wanton round his car  Along th' aethereal road  Plenty and Health attend his beams  And Truth divinely bright proclaims  The visit of the God  Aw'd by the view my soul reveres  The Great FIRST CAUSE that bade the spheres  In tuneful order move  Thine is the sablemantled Night  Unseen Almighty and the Light  The radiance of thy love  Hark the awaken'd grove repays  With melody the genial rays  And Echo spreads the strain  The streams in grateful murmurs run  The bleating flocks salute the sun  And music glads the plain  While Nature thus her charms displays  Let me enjoy the fragrant breeze  The opening flowers diffuse  Temp'rance and Innocence attend  These are your haunts your influence lend  Associates of the Muse  Riot and Guilt and wasting Care  And fell Revenge and black Despair  Avoid the Morning's light  Nor beams the sun nor blooms the rose  Their restless passions to compose  Who Virtue's dictates slight  Along the mead and in the wood  And on the margin of the flood  The Goddess walks confest  She gives the landscape power to charm  The sun his genial heat to warm  The wife and generous breast  Happy the man whose tranquil mind  Sees Nature in her changes kind  And pleas'd the whole surveys  For him the morn benignly smiles  And evening shades reward the toils  That measure out his days  The varying year may shift the scene  The sounding tempest lash the main  And Heaven's own thunders roll  Calmly he views the bursting storm  Tempests nor thunder can deform  The morning of his soul  TO A LADY WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES ON VALENTINE'S DAY  BY VILLIERS DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM  BRIMFUL of anger not of love  The champion sends his foe one glove  But I who have a double share  Of softer passion send a pair  Nor think it dearest Celia cruel  That I invite you to a duel  Ready to meet you face to face  At any time in any place  Nor will I leave you in the lurch  Tho' you should dare to name the church  There come equipp'd with all your charms  The ring and

Invite my song Ye Sylvans haunt your bowers  Waft round your sweets and open all your flowers  And thou who shut'st not to the suppliant's prayer  Nor to the aidimploring voice thine ear  Do thou O MANCHESTER protect the song  The Muse's care does to the learn'd belong  Grateful alike Muse Subject Author bow  And hail the source whence all their pleasures flow  These plains that annual pour their sweets for thee  Thanks to thy bounty yield a part to me  And Ease fair Virtue's and the Poet's friend  Thro' your indulgence on my steps attend  Impervious to the sun's most potent ray  Yon lofty elms their arched heads display  From far the traveller sees their summit rise  Scarce half distinguish'd from the neighbouring skies  But oft surveying as he onward goes  Greener and fairer still the object grows  Till underneath their shade at ease reclin'd  He leaves the labour of the day behind  Soft breezes cool him from surrounding bowers  And Nature bland her gay profusion pours  So they who dauntless plow the dangerous main  What will not daring man attempt for gain  At early dawn from topmasthead espy  A rising vapour in the bordering sky  Ere day's mid course that vapour oft they find  A royal navy hovering in the wind  Yards sails and streamers crowd the whispering air  And all the glories of the deep appear  Nor less impervious that extended shade  By reverend oaks the growth of ages made  Save where wide avenues that shade divide  And shew the woodland in its utmost pride  Here let the huntsman wind the echoing horn  Cheer his swift steed and wake the rosy morn  Let dogs and men in noisy concert join  And sportsmen call the harmony divine  The Muse delights not fond of pensive ease  In dissipation or pursuits like these  And thou sweet Thrush prolong thy amorous tale  Let thy loveburthen'd song delight the vale  No leaden death I bring no toils for thee  Sing on and soothe thy feather'd progeny  Come peaceful Precepts of the Samian Sage  Unbend the bow and curb an iron age  Whatever laws shortsighted man may make  Who cannot give can have no power to take  He and he only who could life bestow  May call his blessing from the realms below  Let shaggy bears that prowl Moscovia's shore  Stain their fierce claws or dip their tongue in gore  This does not equal human beasts of prey  What they for hunger we for pleasure slay  Nor is this thirst of blood to man confin'd  See S a savage of the fairer kind  Pardon me You whose nobler tears can flow  For aught that suffers misery below  Who shrink to rob the insect of its hour  Or bruise its offspring in the opening flower  Your form your fears were by great Heaven design'd  At once to charm and humanize mankind  When Nature fair from her Creator sprung  And wondering angels hallelujahs sung  The sylvan scene blest seat to man was given  The richest bounty of indulgent Heaven  To Peace then sacred be the shady grove  Be there no murmurs heardbut those of love  Love fled from noise and cities haunts the glade  The falling fountains and the silent shade  Inspires each warbling songster in the bower  Breathes in each gale and blossoms in each flower  When every object thus their charms combine  What bosom can resist the power divine  Too feeble that which now the Muse inspires  And with her own admits still warmer fires  Here here I felt the soft infection rise  Pant at the breast and languish in the eyes  When Mira to my humble cot was led  Love's willing victim to an husband's bed  And now still feel in smoother channels run  Those streams that rapid passion first begun  Esteem affection friendship ne'er decline  Nor are her virtues less for being mine  Let Rome her fetter'd monks to cells withdraw  And force her own against great Nature's law  Drag blooming virgins useless from mankind  And give to lust what was for love design'd  'Tis mine to tread on Albion's blissful shore  Where sinful celibacy binds no more  Now sultry Phoebus far from Thetis' bed  Darts his fierce rays resistless o'er my head  Slow thro' you walk oftwinding let me rove  And wander deep within the silent grove  Or if too potent there his beams invade  O let me tread those limes more cooling shade  That shade which shall your kind protection gain  And Brown himself provoke the axe in vain  In milder climes and blest with cloudless skies  Let slender domes on hills unshelter'd rise  Where constant seasons glad the neighbouring plains  And Phoebus holds not Phaëton the reins  But where loud waves oft vex the seagirt shore  And sudden tempests unexpected roar  Where rough December envious of her power  From gentle May oft plucks the tender flower  Where clearest morn to cloudy noon gives way  And stormy eve excludes the hopeful day  Where o'er the vast Atlantic vapours roll  Or frozen sogs dark issue from the pole  There the firm building asks the planter's aid  " From storms a shelter and from heat a shade"  In gardening great th' improvement of the age  Clipt yews cut out in Magogs quit the stage  Half murder'd hollies meet with one wound more  And clasping ivy leaves the loaded door  But yet the axe may drive the edge too far  Brown not with Nature yet with climes may war  Use or convenience oft put in their claim  " And rise to faults good judges dare not blame"  Nor can true taste and elegance reside  Where order and gradation are deny'd  By walls immur'd or lost within a wood  The cloister'd mansions of our fathers stood  They sought protection from the dogstar's heat  And heard tho' felt not the rude tempest beat  But damps pervaded oft the gloomy hall  And greengrown mould defac'd the 'scutcheon'd wall  Fond of extremes and wiser sure than they  We drive walls trees damps arms and all away  Yield still too far to every thing that's new  Nor dare to keep the golden mean in view  But see the sun the steep of heaven descends  And yon kind cloud her golden curtain lends  Let me ye Walks your flowery maze pursue  And on one plain the world's whole tribute view  That tribute Commerce which we owe to thee  As thou we owe to godlike Liberty  Here spicy shrubs the growth of Afric bloom  And ancient Asia breathes her sweet perfume  Columbean wilds their later treasures yield  And British roses crown the flowery field  AUTHOR OF GOOD how are thy blessings shed  On man's on thereby man's much honour'd head  From glowing India to

part partakes thy more peculiar care  Yon spreading fig that first from India came  Stretch'd broad her leaves to cool the sunburnt dame  Soft cypress rises on the Paphian plain  To soothe the grief

violets spread  And yellow cowslips rear their bended head  Brisk thro' the thicket trips the spotted fawn  And sportive lambs bound wanton on the lawn  Those oaks the future sovereigns of the sea  Stretch wide their boughs and clothe their heads for thee  Bloom fresh ye sacred Guardians of our isle  War's rage is o'er and Peace now deigns to smile  Here stand the graceful monarchs of the wood  Nor unprovok'd attempt the swelling flood  Remain secure as erst when Druids made  Their songs divine beneath your reverend shade  But soon as jarring nations faithless grown  Enrich'd with trade and commerce not their own  Shall basely strive those honours to obtain  By meanest arts which courage sought in vain  Then then indignant quit the fertile shore  And bid the deep assist your thunder's roar  When hapless England felt a tyrant's sway  And that fierce tyrant fell to lust a prey  Here fill'd with grief an injur'd princess  Catherine of Spain during the latter part of the time of the divorce retired to Kimbolton Castle where she died it is supposed of grief for the cruel treatment she received from Henry VIII  fled  From shortliv'd grandeur and divided bed  Oppression spread her horrors o'er the plain  And all thy sweets Kimbolton bloom'd in vain  For not the fragrant breath of rosy morn  Nor tuneful lark on rising pinions borne  Nor all the verdure of the blooming spiring  Can to the broken heart lost pleasure bring  In England then the sons of Freedom slept  And drooping Virtue o'er their ashes wept  In vain for right the royal stranger cry'd  That right his slaves enjoy'd her lord deny'd  Yon inmost grove oft heard her mournful tale  Her sorrows spread along this silent vale  Till Fate in pity call'd her to the shore  Where lust and tyranny oppress no more  Thrice happy change where royal virtue griev'd  The aged and the orphan are reliev'd  And thankful widows crowd the open'd door  Where weeping majesty complain'd before  O Britons if to pagan powers ye bow  Be smiling Liberty ador'd by you  Where mad Oppression waves her iron wand  There Truth and Justice quit the wasted land  But where the people feel a father's sway  As Rome felt once and Britain feels today  There Justice equal with the Sovereign reigns  And peace and plenty glads the smiling plains  When they who govern with the govern'd join  And without faction all their force combine  Not the loud cannon nor the ocean's roar  That beats with angry waves the sounding shore  Can crush contending hosts or awe them more  Those laurels Granby that adorn thy brow  Far from the muddy fount of faction grew  Fair Union gently rear'd the parent tree  That stretch'd so wide her boughs for Hawke and thee  And thus united subject of my lays  Thy sons Kimbolton claim'd the patriot's praise  Who left their fields to guard the the threat'ned shore  Ere Eliot fought and Thurot was no more  And tho' no annals to their race shall tell  What numbers vanquish'd by their valour fell  The soul resolv'd that waited firm the foe  And in his bosom brav'd th' impending blow  Or conquer'd for his native fields or bled  Tho' no green laurels shade his honour'd head  But lo my Muse the humid drops descend  And parting shepherds to the hamlets tend  O quit the task those beauties to display  That fairer spring with each returning day  So Reynolds thus presuming on his art  To trace those charms my Lord that win your heart  Sees softer smiles whene'er he lifts his eye  That bid him throw his baffled pencil by  RETIREMENT AN ODE  BY MR BEATIE  SHOOK from the purple wings of Even  When dews impearl the grove  And from the darkening verge of Heaven  Beams the sweet star of Love  Laid on a daisysprinkled green  Beside a plaintive stream  A meekey'd Youth of serious mien  Indulg'd this solemn theme  Ye cliffs in hoary grandeur pil'd  High o'er the glimmering dale  Ye groves along whose windings wild  Soft sighs the saddening gale  Where oft lone Melancholy strays  By wilder'd Fancy sway'd  What time the wan moon's yellow rays  Gleam thro' the chequer'd shade  To you ye wastes whose artless charms  Ne'er drew Ambition's eye  'Scap'd a tumultuous world's alarms  To your retreats I fly  Deep in your most sequester'd bower  Let me my woes resign  Where Solitude mild modest power  Leans on her ivy'd shrine  How shall I woo thee matchless Fair  Thy heavenly smile how win  Thy smile that smooths the brow of Care  And stills each storm within  O wilt thou to thy favourite grove  Thine ardent votary bring  And bless his hours and bid them move  Serene on silent wing  Oft let Remembrance soothe his mind  With dreams of former days  When soft on Leisure's lap reclin'd  He caroll'd sprightly lays  Blest days when Fancy smil'd at Care  When Pleasure toy'd with Truth  Nor Envy with malignant glare  Had harm'd his simple Youth  'Twas then O Solitude to thee  His early vows were paid  From heart sincere and warm and free  Devoted to the shade  Ah why did Fate his steps decoy  In thorny paths to roam  Remote from all congenial joy  O take thy wanderer home  Henceforth thy awful haunts be mine  The longabandon'd hill  The hollow cliff whose waving pine  O'erhangs the darksome rill  Whence the scar'd owl on pinions grey  Breaks from the rustling boughs  And down the lone vale sails away  To shades of deep repose  O while to thee the woodland pours  Its wildly warbling song  And fragrant from the waste of flowers  The zephyr breathes along  Let no rude sound invade from far  No vagrant foot be nigh  No ray from Grandeur's gilded car  Flash on the startled eye  Yet if some pilgrim 'mid the glade  Thy hallow'd bowers explore  O guard from harm his hoary head  And listen to his lore  For he of joys divine shall tell  That wean from earthly woe  And triumph o'er the mighty spell  That chains this heart below  For me no more the path invites  Ambition loves to tread  No more I climb those toilsome heights  By guileful Hope misled  Leaps my fond fluttering heart no more  To Mirth's enlivening strain  For present pleasure soon is o'er  And all the past is vain  THE TRIUMPH OF MELANCHOLY  BY THE SAME  MEMORY be still why throng upon the thought  These scenes so deeply stain'd with Sorrow's die  Is there in all thy stores no chearful draught  To brighten yet once more in Fancy's eye  Yesfrom afar a landscape seems to rise  Embellish'd by the lavish hand of Spring  Thin gilded clouds float lightly o'er the skies  And laughing Loves disport on fluttering wing  How blest the youth in yonder valley laid  What smiles in every conscious feature play  While to the murmurs of the breezy glade  His merry pipe attunes the rural lay  Hail Innocence whose bosom all serene  Feels not as yet th' internal tempest roll  O ne'er may Care distract that placid mien  Ne'er may the shades of Doubt o'erwhelm thy soul  Vain wish for lo in gay attire conceal'd  Yonder she comes the heartenflaming fiend  Will no kind power the helpless stripling shield  Swift to her destin'd prey see Passion bend  O smile accurst to hide the worst designs  Now with blithe eye she wooes him to be blest  While round her arm unseen a serpent twines  And lo she hurls it hissing at his breast  And instant lo his dizzy eyeball swims  Ghastly and reddening darts a frantic glare  Pain with strong grasp distorts his writhing limbs  And Fear's cold hand erects his frozen hair  Is this O Life is this thy boasted prime  And does thy spring no happier prospect yield  Why should the sunbeam pain thy glittering clime  When the keen mildew desolates the field  How Memory pains Let some gay theme beguile  The musing mind and soothe to soft delight  Ye images of Woe no more recoil  Be life's past scenes wrapt in oblivious night  Now when fierce Winter arm'd with wasteful power  Heaves the wild deep that thunders from afar  How sweet to sit in the sequester'd bower  To hear and but to hear the mingling war  Ambition here displays no gilded toy  That tempts on desperate wing the soul to rise  Nor Pleasure's paths to wilds of Woe decoy  Nor Anguish lurks in Grandeur's proud disguise  Oft has Contentment chear'd this lone abode  With the mild languish of her smiling eye  Here Health in rosy bloom has often glow'd  While looserob'd Quiet stood enamour'd by  Even the storm lulls to more profound repose  The storm these humble walls assails in vain  The shrub is shelter'd when the whirlwind blows  While the oak's mighty ruin strows the plain  Blow on ye winds thine Winter be the skies  And toss th' infuriate surge and vales lay waste  Nature thy temporary rage defies  To her relief the gentler Seasons haste  Thron'd in her emerald car see Spring appear  As Fancy wills the landscape starts to view  Her emerald car the youthful Zephyrs bear  Fanning her bosom with their pinions blue  Around the jocund Hours are fluttering seen  And lo her rod the roselip'd Power extends  And lo the lawns are deck'd in living green  And Beauty's brightey'd train from Heaven descends  Haste happy days and make all Nature glad  But will all Nature joy at your return  O can ye chear pale Sickness' gloomy bed  Or dry the tears that bathe th' untimely urn  Will ye one transient ray of gladness dart  Where groans the dungeon to the captive's wail  To ease tir'd Disappointment's bleeding heart  Will all your stores of softening balm avail  When stern Oppression in his harpyfangs  From Want's weak grasp the last sad morsel bears  Can ye allay the dying parent's pangs  Whose infant craves relief with fruitless tears  For ah thy reign Oppression is not past  Who from the shivering limbs the vestment rends  Who lays the once rejoicing village waste  Bursting the ties of lovers and of friends  But hope not Muse vainglorious as thou art  With the weak impulse of thy humble strain  Hope not to soften Pride's obdurate heart  When ERROLL's bright example shines in vain  Then cease the theme Turn Fancy turn thine eye  Thy weeping eye nor further urge thy flight  Thy haunts alas no gleams of joy supply  Or transient gleams that flash and sink in night  Yet fain the mind its anguish would forego  Spread then historic Muse thy pictur'd scroll  Bid thy great scenes in all their splendor glow  And rouse to thought sublime th' exulting soul  What mingling pomps rush on th' enraptur'd gaze  Lo where the gallant navy rides the deep  Here glittering towns their spiry turrets raise  There bulwarks overhang the shaggy steep  Bristling with spears and bright with burnish'd shields  Th' embattled legions stretch their long array  Discord's red torch as fierce she scours the fields  With bloody tincture stains the face of day  And now the hosts in silence wait the sign  Keen are their looks whom Liberty inspires  Quick as the Goddess darts along the line  Each breast impatient burns with noble fires  Her form how graceful in her lofty mien  The smiles of Love stern Wisdom's frown controul  Her fearless eye determin'd tho' serene  Speaks the great purpose and th' unconquer'd soul  Mark where Ambition leads the adverse band  Each feature fierce and haggard as with pain  With menace loud he cries while from his hand  He vainly strives to wipe the crimson stain  Lo at his call impetuous as the storms  Headlong to deeds of death the hosts are driven  Hatred to madness wrought each face deforms  Mounts the black whirlwind and involves the heaven  Now Virtue now thy powerful succour lend  Shield them for Liberty who dare to die  Ah Liberty will none thy cause befriend  Are those thy sons thy generous sons that fly  Not Virtue's self when Heaven its aid denies  Can brace the loosen'd nerves or warm the heart  Not Virtue's self can still the bursts of sighs  When festers in the soul Misfortune's dart  See where by Terror and Despair dismay'd  The scattering legions pour along the plain  Ambition's car in bloody spoils array'd  Hews its broad way as Vengeance guides the rein  But who is he that by yon lonely brook  Such according to Plutarch was the scene of Brutus's death    With woods o'erhung and precipices rude  Lies all abandon'd yet with dauntless look  Sees streaming from his breast the purple flood  Ah Brutus ever thine be Virtue's tear  Lo his dim eyes to Liberty he turns  As scarce supported on her broken spear  O'er her expiring son the Goddess mourns  Loose to the wind her azure mantle flies  From her dishevell'd locks she rends the plume  No lustre lightens in her weeping eyes  And on her tearstain'd cheek no roses bloom  Meanwhile the world Ambition owns thy sway  Fame's loudest trumpet labours with thy name  For thee the Muse awakes her sweetest lay  And Flattery bids for thee her altars flame  Nor in life's lofty bustling sphere alone  The sphere where monarchs and where heroes toil  Sink Virtue's sons beneath Misfortune's frown  While Guilt's thrill'd bosom leaps at Pleasure's smile  Full oft where Solitude and Silence dwell  Far far remote amid the lowly plain  Resounds the voice of Woe from Virtue's cell  Such is Man's doom and Pity weeps in vain  Still Grief recoilsHow vainly have I strove  Thy power O Melancholy to withstand  Tir'd I submit but yet O yet remove  Or ease the pressure of thy heavy hand  Yet for a while let the bewilder'd soul  Find in society relief from woe  O yield a while to Friendship's soft controul  Some respite Friendship wilt thou not bestow  Come then Philander whose exalted mind  Looks down from far on all that charms the great  For thou canst bear unshaken and resign'd  The brightest smiles the blackest frowns of Fate  Come thou whose love unlimited sincere  Nor Faction cools nor Injury destroys  Who lend'st to Misery's moan a pitying ear  And feel'st with ecstasy another's joys  Who know'st man's frailty with a favouring eye  And melting heart behold'st a brother's fall  Who unenslav'd by Fashion's narrow tye  With manly freedom follow'st Nature's call  And bring thy Delia sweetlysmiling fair  Whose spotless soul no rankling thoughts deform  Her gentle accents calm each throbbing care  And harmonize the thunder of the storm  Tho' blest with wisdom and with wit refin'd  She courts no homage nor desires to shine  In her each sentiment sublime is join'd  To female softness and a form divine  Come and disperse th' involving shadows drear  Let chasten'd Mirth the social hours employ  O catch the swiftwing'd moment while 'tis near  On swiftest wing the moment flies of joy  Even while the careless disencumber'd soul  Sinks all dissolving into Pleasure's dream  Even then to time's tremendous verge we roll  With headlong haste along life's surgy stream  Can Gaiety the vanish'd years restore  Or on the withering limbs fresh beauty shed  Or soothe the sad inevitable Hour  Or Chear the dark dark mansions of the Dead  Still sounds the solemn knell in Fancy's ear  That call'd Eliza to the silent tomb  With her how jocund roll'd the sprightly year  How shone the nymph in Beauty's brightest bloom  Ah Beauty's bloom avails not in the grave  Youth's lofty mien nor Age's awful grace  Moulder alike unknown the Prince and Slave  Whelm'd in th' enormous wreck of human race  The thoughtfix'd portraiture the breathing bust  The arch with proud memorials array'd  The longliv'd pyramid shall sink in dust  To dumb Oblivion's everdesart shade  Fancy from Joy still wanders far astray  Ah Melancholy how I feel thy power  Long have I labour'd to elude thy sway  But 'tis enough for I resist no more  The traveller thus that o'er the midnight waste  Thro' many a lonesome path is doom'd to roam  'Wilder'd and weary sits him down at last  For the long night and distant far his home  ELEGY OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF A LADY  BY THE SAME  STILL shall unthinking Man substantial

real scenes rush dismal on the eye  And from the bowers of Beauty torn  The startled soul awakes to thinkand mourn  O Ye whose hours in jocund train advance  Whose spirits to the song of gladness dance  Who flowery scenes in endless view survey  Glittering in beams of visionary day  O yet while Fate delays th' impending woe  Be rous'd to thought anticipate the blow  Lest like the light'ning's glance the sudden ill  Flash to confound and penetrate to kill  Lest thus encompass'd with funereal gloom  Like me ye bend o'er some untimely tomb  Pour your wild ravings in night's frighted ear  And half pronounce Heaven's sacred doom severe  Wise Beauteous GoodO every grace combin'd  That charms the eye that captivates the mind  Fair as the flowret opening on the morn  Whose leaves bright drops of liquid pearl adorn  Sweet as the downypinion'd gale that roves  To gather fragrance in Arabian groves  Mild as the strains that at the close of day  Warbling remote along the vales decay  Yet why

care beguile  Gaze on that cheek where all the Graces smile  That soulexpressing eye benignly bright  Where Meekness beams ineffable delight  That brow where Wisdom sits enthron'd serene  Each feature forms and dignifies the mien  Still let me listen while her words impart  The sweet effusions of the blameless heart  Till all my soul each tumult charm'd away  Yields gently led to Virtue's easy sway  By thee inspir'd O Virtue Age is young  And music warbles from the faultering tongue  Thy ray creative chears the clouded brow  And decks the faded cheek with rosy glow  Brightens the joyless aspect and supplies  Pure heavenly lustre to the languid eyes  Each look each action while it awes invites  And Age with every youthful grace delights  But when Youth's living bloom reflects thy beams  Resistless on the view the glory streams  Th' ecstatic breast triumphant Virtue warms  And Beauty dazzles with angelic charms  Ah whither fledye dear illusions stay  Lo pale and silent lies the lovely clay  How are the roses on that lip decay'd  Which Health in all the pride of bloom array'd  Health on her form each sprightly grace bestow'd  With active life each speaking feature glow'd  Fair was the flower and soft the vernal sky  Elate with hope we deem'd no tempest nigh  When lo a whirlwind's instantaneous gust  Left all its beauties withering in the dust  All cold the hand that sooth'd

spare the weed yet lop the lovely flower  Why fly thy shafts in lawless error driven  To Virtue then no more the care of Heaven  But peace bold thought be still my bursting heart  We not ELIZA felt the fatal dart  Scap'd the dark dungeon does the slave complain  Nor bless the hand that broke the galling chain  Say pines not Virtue for the lingering morn  On this dark wild condemn'd to roam forlorn  Where Reason's meteorrays with sickly glow  O'er the dun gloom a dreadful glimmering throw  Disclosing dubious to th' affrighted eye  O'erwhelming mountains tottering from on high  Black billowy seas in storms perpetual tost  And weary ways in wildering labyrinths lost  O happy stroke that bursts the bonds of clay  Darts thro' the rending gloom the blaze of day  And wings the soul with boundless flight to soar  When dangers threat and fears alarm no more  Transporting thought here let me wipe away  The falling tear and wake a bolder lay  But ah afresh the swimming eye o'erflows

and this only can Absence employ  Can ease my fond heart and beguile my soft pain  Till I see with delight my dear charmer again  Ah who ever knew such full transports as I  While with her the swift minutes unheeded pass'd by  Alas with the sweet recollection I burn  Bring back your delights ye dear moments return  Ah me what delights in my bosom would rise  While with eager attention I've hung on her eyes  And watch'd the kind beams of Compassion and Love  While she pitied my passion and seem'd to approve  Ah me with what raptur'd attention I've hung  To catch the sweet accents that flow'd from her tongue  When tenderness bade the dear maiden impart  The pleasing sensations that glow'd in her heart  O how does my Fair one consume the long day  Is the Charmer quite easy while I am away  Indeed if our thoughts like our hearts should agree  The dear lovely maiden is thinking on me  Ah did she but think with such fondness as I  How much would she grieve and how oft would she sigh  Yet with so much fond Love may her bosom ne'er burn  If she fighs as I sigh if she mourns as I mourn  But why do I wander why sigh thus alone  Alas 'tis the loss of my Fair that I moan  Why thus every hour does my sorrow increase  Alas it is Absence that ruins my peace  Why swells my sad bosom with fear and with grief  Ah nought but her presence can bring me relief  Why thus down my cheek trickles fast the big tear  Alas can I help itmy Fair is not here  Till I nourish'd this passion I all unconcern'd  Saw Peace my companion wherever I turn'd  Till now with my heart all at ease I could rest  And a sigh was a stranger unknown to my breast  What then is this Love and why do I endure  These griefs in my mind nor endeavour to cure  When thus my fond heart is o'erwhelm'd with Despair  And I know no delight when away from my Fair  Yet Colin these pains spite of all thou hast said  By one hour of her presence are far overpaid  These sorrows from Absence which now you deplore  Then vanish are lost and are thought of no more  Recall those rash words and forbear to complain  Since the next tender meeting rewards all your pain  Let sweet Expectation then lessen your care  Let Hope soften Absence and keep off Despair  Sure sure those dear pleasures once more will return  How long in this Absence distrest must I mourn  How long must I wish while my lot I deplore  That dear angelfacecould I see it once more  That dear angelvoiceTime how swift didst thou seem  While I listen'd enchanted as Love was her theme  O come those dear hours and to soothe my fond pain  Love again be her theme and I listen again  How dull and how slow do the moments retreat  Time was when they flewnow there's lead on their feet  Ye Loiterers be gone why so long do ye stay  Ye fly when I'm with her ye creep when away  Ah Colin how foolish Time's progress to blame  His paces are equal his motions the same  'Twas the joy of her Presence made Time appear fleet  'Tis the pain of her Absence adds lead to his feet  ODE TO HEALTH  BY MRS BROOKE  THE Lesbian lute no more can charm  Nor my oncepanting bosom warm  No more I breathe the tender sigh  Nor when my beauteous swain appears  With downcast look and starting tears  Confess the lustre of his eye  With Freedom blest at early dawn  I wander o'er the verdant lawn  And hail the sweet returning Spring  The fragrant breeze the feather'd choir  To raise my vernal joys conspire  While Peace and Health their treasures bring  Come lovely Health divinest maid  And lead me thro' the rural shade  To thee the rural shades belong  'Tis thine to bless the simple swain  And while he tries the tuneful strain  To raise the raptur'd Poet's song  Behold the patient villagehind  No cares disturb his tranquil mind  By thee and sweet Contentment blest  All day he turns the stubborn plain  And meets at eve his infant train  While guiltless pleasure fills his breast  O ever good and bounteous still  By fountain fresh or murmuring rill  Let me thy blissful presence find  Thee Goddess thee my steps pursue  When careless of the morning dew  I leave the lessening vales behind  ODE  BY THE SAME  O Far remov'd from my retreat  Be Avarice and Ambition's feet  Give me unconscious of their power  To taste the peaceful social hour  Give me beneath the branching vine  The woodbine sweet or eglantine  While evening sheds its balmy dews  To court the chaste inspiring Muse  Or with the partner of my soul  To mix the heartexpanding bowl  Yes dear Sabina when with thee  I hail the Goddess Liberty  When joyous thro' the leafy grove  Or o'er the flowery mead we rove  When thy dear tender bosom shares  Thy faithful Delia's joys and cares  Nor Pomp nor Wealth my wishes move  Nor the more soft deceiver Love  ODE TO FRIENDSHIP  BY THE SAME  NO more fond Love shall wound my breast  In all his smiles deceitful drest  I scorn his coward sway  And now with pleasure can explore  The galling chains I felt before  Since I am free today  Today with Friendship I'll rejoice  Whilst dear Lucinda's gentle voice  Shall soften every care  O Goddess of the joy sincere  The social sigh the pleasing tear  Thy noble bonds I'll wear  When first illfated hapless hour  My soul confest Amintor's power  Lucinda shar'd my grief  And leaning on her faithful breast  The fatal passion I confest  And found a soft relief  My steps she oft was wont to lead  Along the fair enamell'd mead  To soothe my raging pain  And oft with tender converse strove  To draw the sting of hopeless Love  And make me smile again  O muchlov'd Maid whilst life remains  To thee I'll consecrate my strains  For thee I'll tune my lyre  And echoing with my sweetest lays  The vocal hills shall speak the praise  Of Friendship's sacred fire  TO THE MOON  BY MR ROBERT LLOYD  ALL hail majestic Queen of Night  Bright Cynthia sweetest Nymph whose presence brings  The pensive pleasures calm delight  While Contemplation smooths her ruffled wings  Which Folly's vain tumultuous joys  Or business care and buzz of lusty day  Have all too ruffledHence away  Stale Jest and flippant Mirth and Strifeengendering Noise  When Evening dons her mantle grey  I'll wind my solitary way  And hie me to some lonely grove  The haunt of Fancy and of Love  Whose social branches far outspread  Possess the mind with pleasing dread  While Cynthia quivers thro' the trees  That wanton with the summer breeze  And the clear brook or dimpled stream  Reflects oblique her dancing beam  How often by thy silver light  Have lovers tongues beguil'd the Night  When forth the happy pair have stray'd  The amorous swain and tender maid  And as they walk'd the groves along  Chear'd the still eve with various song  While every artful strain confest  The mutual passion in their breast  To lovers hours fly swift away  And Night reluctant yields to Day  Thrice happy Nymph thrice happy Youth  When Beauty is the meed of Truth  Yet not the happy Loves alone  Has thy celestial presence known  To thee complains the Nymph forlorn  Of broken faith and vows forsworn  And the dull Swain with folded arms  Still musing on his false one's charms  Frames many a sonnet to her name  As lovers use to express their flame  Or pining wan with thoughtful care  In downcast silence feeds Despair  Or when the air dead stillness keeps  And Cynthia on the water sleeps  Charms the dull ear of sober night  With loveborn Music's sweet delight  Oft as thy orb performs its round  Thou listenest to the various sound  Of Shepherds hopes and Maidens fears  Those conscious Cynthia silent hears  While Echo which still loves to mock  Bears them about from rock to rock  But shift we now the pensive scene  Where Cynthia silvers o'er the green  Mark yonder spot whose equal rim  Forms the green circle quaint and trim  Hither the Fairies blithe advance  And lightly trip in mazy dance  Beating the pansiepaven ground  In frolic measures round and round  These Cynthia's Revels gaily keep  While lazy mortals snore asleep  Whom oft they visit in the night  Not visible to human sight  And as old prattling Wives relate  Tho' now the fashion's out of date  Drop sixpence in the Housewife's shoe  And pinch the Slattern black and blue  They fill the mind with airy schemes  And bring the Ladies pleasant dreams  Who knows not Mab whose chariot glides  And athwart men's noses rides  While Oberon blithe Fairy trips  And hovers o'er the ladies lips  And when he steals ambrosial bliss  And soft imprints the charming kiss  In Dreams the nymph her swain pursues  Nor thinks 'tis Oberon that wooes  Ye sportive Youth and lovely Fair  From hence my lesson read beware  While Innocence and Mirth preside  We care not where the Fairies glide  And Oberon will never miss  To greet his favourites with a kiss  Nor ever more ambrosia sips  Than when he visits's lips  When all things else in silence sleep  The blithsome Elfs their vigils keep  And always hover round about  To find our worth or frailties out  Receive with joy these Elfin sparks  Their kisses leave no telltale marks  But breathe fresh beauty o'er the face  Where all is virtue all is grace  Not only elfin fays delight  To hail the sober Queen of Night  But that sweet bird whose gurgling throat  Warbles the thick melodious note  Duly as evening shades prevail  Renews her soothing lovelorn tale  And as the Lover pensive goes  Chaunts out her symphony of woes  Which in boon Nature's wilder tone  Beggar all sounds which Art has known  But histthe melancholy bird  Among the groves no more is heard  And Cynthia pales her silver ray  Before th' approach of golden Day  Which on yon mountain's misty height  Stands tiptoe with his gladsome light  Now the shrill lark in aether floats  And carols wide her liquid notes  While Phoebus in his lusty pride  His flaming beams flings far and wide  Cynthia farewellthe pensive Muse  No more her feeble flight pursues  But all unwilling takes her way  And mixes with the buzz of Day  A BALLAD  BY THE SAME  YE shepherds so careless and gay  Who sport with the nymphs of the plain  Take heed lest you frolic away  The peace you can never regain  Let not Folly your bosoms annoy  And of Love the dear mischief beware  You may think 'tis all sunshine and joy  I know 'its o'ershadow'd with care  Love's morning how blithsome it shines  With an aspect deceitfully fair  Its day oft in sorrow declines  And it sets in the night of despair  Hope paints the gay scene to the sight  While Fancy her visions bestows  And gilds every dream with delight  But to wake us to sensible woes  How hard is my lot to complain  Of a nymph whom I yet must adore  Tho' she love not her shepherd again  Her Damon must love her the more  For it was not the pride of her sex  That treated his vows with disdain  For it was not the pleasure to vex  That made her delude her fond swain  'Twas His the fair nymph to behold  He hop'dand he rashly believ'd  'Twas Hers to be fatally cold  He lov'dand was fondly deceiv'd  For such is of lovers the doom  While passions their reason beguile  'Tis warrant enough to presume  If they catch but a look or a smile  Yet surely my Phillis would seem  To prize me most shepherds above  But that might be only esteem  While I foolishly construed it love  Yet others like Damon believ'd  The nymph might have favour'd her swain  And others like Him were deceiv'd  Like Him tho' they cannot complain  Of Phyllis was always my song  For she was my pride and my care  And the folks as we wander'd along  Would call us the conjugal pair  They mark'd how I walk'd at her side  How her hand to my bosom I prest  Each tender endearment I try'd  And I thought none was ever so blest  But now the delusion is o'er  These daydreams of pleasure are fled  Now Her Damon is pleasing no more  And the hopes of her shepherd are dead  May he that my fair shall obtain  May He as thy Damon be true  Or haply thou'lt think of that swain  Who bids thee dear maiden adieu  A BALLAD  BY THE SAME  HARK hark 'tis a voice from the tomb  Come Lucy it cries come away  The grave of thy Colin has room  To rest thee beside his cold clay  I come my dear shepherd I come  Ye friends and companions adieu  I haste to my Colin's dark home  To die on his bosom so true  All mournful the midnight bell rung  When Lucy sad Lucy arose  And forth to the green turf she sprung  Where Colin's pale ashes repose  All wet with the night's chilling dew  Her bosom embrac'd the cold ground  While stormy winds over her blew  And nightravens croak'd all around  How long my lov'd Colin she cry'd  How long must thy Lucy complain  How long shall the grave my love hide  How long ere it join us again  For thee thy fond shepherdess liv'd  With thee o'er the world would she fly  For thee has she sorrow'd and griev'd  For thee would she lie down and die  Alas what avails it how dear  Thy Lucy was once to her swain  Her face like the lily so fair  And eyes that gave light to the plain  The shepherd that lov'd her is gone  That face and those eyes charm no more  And Lucy forgot and alone  To death shall her Colin deplore  While thus she lay sunk in despair  And mourn'd to the echoes around  Inflam'd all at once grew the air  And thunder shook dreadful the ground  I hear the kind call and obey  O Colin receive me she cried  Then breathing a groan o'er his clay  She hung on his tombstone and died  LOVEELEGIES  BY MR HAMMOND  ELEGY I  WHILE calm you sit beneath your secret shade  And lose in pleasing thought the summerday  Or tempt the wish of some unpractis'd maid  Whose

much Love is all thy suppliant's fault  No virgin's easy faith I e'er betray'd  My tongue ne'er boasted of a feign'd embrace  No poisons in the cup have I convey'd  Nor veil'd destruction with a friendly face  No secret horrors gnaw this quiet breast  This pious hand ne'er robb'd the sacred fane  I ne'er disturb'd the Gods eternal rest  With curses loudbut oft have pray'd in vain  No stealth of Time has thinn'd my flowing hair  Nor Age yet bent me with his iron hand  Ah why so soon the tender blossom tear  E'er Autumn yet the ripen'd fruit demand  Ye Gods whoe'er in gloomy shades below  Now slowly tread your melancholy round  Now wandering view the paleful rivers flow  And musing hearken to their solemn sound  O let me still enjoy the chearful day  Till many years unheeded o'er me roll'd  Pleas'd in my age I trifle life away  And tell how much we lov'd e'er I grew old  But you who now with festive garlands crown'd  In chace of Pleasure the gay moments spend  By quick enjoyment heal Love's pleasing wound  And grieve for nothing but your absent Friend  ELEGY II  BY THE SAME  NOW Delia breathes in woods the fragrant air  Dull are the hearts that still in town remain  Venus herself attends on Delia there  And Cupid sports amid the sylvan train  O with what joy my Delia to behold  I'd press the spade or wield the weighty prong  Guide the slow ploughshare thro' the stubborn mold  And patient goad the loitering ox along  The scorching heats I'd carelessly despise  Nor heed the blisters on my tender hand  The great Apollo wore the same disguise  Like me subdued to Love's supreme command  No healing herbs could soothe their master's pain  The art of physic lost and useless lay  To Peneus' stream and Tempe's shady plain  He drove his herds beneath the noontide ray  Oft with a bleating lamb in either arm  His blushing Sister  The Goddess Diana  saw him pace along  Oft would his voice the silent valley charm  Till lowing oxen broke the tender song  Where are his triumphs where his warlike toil  Where by his darts the crested Python slain  Where are his Delphi his delightful isle  The God himself is grown a cottage swain  O Ceres in your golden fields no more  With Harvest's chearful pomp my fair detain  Think what for lost Proserpina  The daughter of Ceres taken from her by Pluto  you bore  And in a mother's anguish feel my pain  Our wiser fathers left their fields unsown  Their food was acorns Love their sole employ  They met they lik'd they stay'd but till alone  And in each valley snatch'd the honest joy  No wakeful guard no doors to stop desire  Thrice happy timesbut O I fondly rave  Lead me to Delia all her eyes inspire  I'll doI'll plough or dig as Delia's slave  ELEGY III  BY THE SAME  LET others boast their heaps of shining gold  And view their fields with waving plenty crown'd  Whom neighbouring foes in constant terror hold  And trumpets break their slumbers never sound  While calmly poor I trifle life away  Enjoy sweet leisure by my chearful fire  No wanton hope my quiet shall betray  But cheaply blest I'll scorn each vain desire  With timely care I'll sow my little field  And plant my orchard with its master's hand  Nor blush to spread the hay the hook to wield  Or range my sheaves along the sunny land  If late at dusk while carelessly I roam  I meet a strolling kid or bleating lamb  Under my arm I'll bring the wanderer home  And not a little chide its thoughtless dam  What joy to hear the tempest howl in vain  And clasp a fearful mistress to my breast  Or lull'd to slumber by the beating rain  Secure and happy sink at last to rest  Or if the sun in flaming Leo ride  By shady rivers indolently stray  And with my Delia walking side by side  Hear how they murmur as they glide away  What joy to wind along the cool retreat  To stop and gaze on Delia as I go  To mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet  And teach my lovely scholar all I know  Thus pleas'd at heart and not with Fancy's dream  In silent happiness I rest unknown  Content with what I am not what I seem  I live for Delia and myself alone  Ah foolish man who thus of her possest  Could float and wander with Ambition's wind  And if his outward trappings spoke him blest  Not heed the sickness of his conscious mind  With her I scorn the idle breath of praise  Nor trust to happiness that's not our own  The smile of Fortune might suspicion raise  But here I know that I am lov'd alone  Stanhope in wisdom as in wit divine  May rise and plead Britannia's glorious cause  With steady rein his eager wit confine  While manly Sense the deep attention draws  Let Stanhope speak his listening country's wrong  My humble voice shall please onepartial maid  For her alone I pen my tender song  Securely sitting in his friendly shade

 And half her swarthy sons sad Ethiopia mourn'd  But since thy flagging piety decay'd  And barter'd God's defence for human aid  See their fair laurels wither on thy brow  Nor herbs nor healthful arts

good Josiah's name  Blest happy prince o'er whose lamented urn  In plaintive song all Judah's daughters mourn  For whom sad Sion's softest Sorrow flows  And Jeremiah pours his sweet melodious woes  But now fall'n Sion once the fair and great  Sits deep in dust abandon'd desolate  Bleeds her sad heart and ever stream her eyes  And anguish tears her with convulsive sighs  The mournful captive

with all her joys  And bids her envy'd walls securely rise  And thou great hallow'd dome in ruin spread  Again shall lift sublime thy sacred head  But ah with weeping eyes the ancients view  A faint resemblance of the old in you  No more th' effulgent glory of thy God  Speaks awful answers from the mystic cloud  No more thine altars blaze with fire divine  And Heaven has left thy solitary shrine  Yet in thy courts hereafter shalt thou see  Presence immediate of the Deity  The light himself reveal'd the God confest in thee  And now at length the fated term of years  The world's desire have brought and lo the God appears  The Heavenly Babe the Virgin Mother bears  And her fond looks confess the parent's cares  The pleasing burden on her breast she lays  Hangs o'er his charms and with a smile surveys  The Infant smiles to her fond bosom prest  And wantons sportive on the mother's breast  A radiant glory speaks him all Divine  And in the Child the beams of Godhead shine  But now alas far other views disclose  The blackest comprehensive scene of woes  See where man's voluntary sacrifice  Bows his meek head and God Eternal dies  Fixt to the Cross his healing arms are bound  While copious Mercy streams from every wound  Mark the blooddrops that life exhausting roll  And the strong pang that rends the stubborn soul  As all death's tortures with severe delay  Exult and riot in the noblest prey  And can'st thou stupid man those sorrows see  Nor share the anguish which He bears for Thee  Thy sin for which his sacred Flesh is torn  Points every nail and sharpens every thorn  Canst thouwhile Nature smarts in every wound  And each pang cleaves the sympathetic ground  Lo the black sun his chariot backward driven  Blots out the day and perishes from Heaven  Earth trembling from her entrails bear a part  And the rent rock upbraids man's stubborn heart  The yawning grave reveals his gloomy reign  And the cold clayclad dead start into life again  And thou O tomb once more shalt wide display  Thy satiate jaws and give up all thy prey  Thou groaning earth shalt heave absorpt in flame  As the last pangs convulse thy labouring frame  When the same God unshrouded thou shalt see  Wrapt in full blaze of Power and Majesty  Ride on the clouds whilst as his chariot flies  The bright effusion streams thro' all the skies  Then shall the proud dissolving mountains glow  And yielding rocks in fiery rivers flow  The molten doluge round the globe shall roar  And all man's arts and labour be no more  Then shall the splendors of th' enliven'd glass  Sink undistinguish'd in the burning mass  And O till earth and seas and Heaven decay  Ne'er may that fair creation fade away  May winds and storms those beauteous colours spare  Still may they bloom as permanent as fair  All the vain rage of wasting time repell  And his Tribunal see whose Cross they paint so well  WINTER PROSPECTS IN THE COUNTRY AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND IN LONDON  BY J S  WHile Learning's pleasing cares my friend detain  By Thames's banks on London's smoaky plain  Where spacious streets their peopled length extend  And pompous domes and lofty spires ascend  Far different views the lonely country yields  Deserted roads and unfrequented fields  Bleak scenes where hoary Winter holds command  And from his throne of clouds o'erlooks the land  He frownsthe power of Vegetation dies  Frosts bind the earth and Tempests rend the skies  Or driving Snows descend or pouring Rains  Or chilling Vapours hover o'er the plains  Sometimes awhile the hoary Tyrant sleeps  Hid in his cave beneath the watery deeps  The distant sun extends a chearing ray  Bright smile the skies and soft the breezes play  Then airy lawns the morning walk invite  And rural landscapes charm the roving sight  Mix'd with brown stubble leafless woods are seen  And neatplough'd furrows clad in scanty green  While turbid waters edg'd with yellow reeds  Wind thro' the russet herdforsaken meads  And groves that Winter's fiercest rage disdain  In fair plantations deck the shelter'd plain  There painted hollies with red berries glow  And their broad leaves the shining laurels show  And pines and firs their varied verdure blend  And cedars spread and cypresses ascend  Pleas'd with the scene I range from field to field  Till loftier lands remoter prospects yield  And there the curious optic tube apply  Till a new world approaches on the eye  Till where dark wood the hills slope surface shrouds  Or the blue summit mingles with the clouds  There fair inclosures lie of varied hue  And trees and houses rise distinct to view  But this too oft th' inclement clime denies  Involv'd in misty or in watery skies  And yet ev'n then with books engag'd I find  A sweet employment for th' exploring mind  There fair Description shews each absent scene  The cornclad mountain and the daisied green  There over distant lands my fancy roves  Thro' India's cany isles and palmy groves  Where clear streams wander thro' luxuriant vales  Midst cloudless skies and evertepid gales  While Spring sits smiling in her brightest bloom  And calls around her every rich perfume  HYMN FROM PSALM LXV  BY THE SAME  PRAISE to th' Almighty Lord of Heaven

roll  By thee Spring Summer Autumn Winter rise  Thou giv'st the frowning Thou the smiling skies  By thy command the softening shower distils  Till genial warmth the teeming furrow fills  Then favouring sunshine o'er the clime extends  And blest by thee the verdant blade ascends  Next Spring's gay products clothe the flowery hills  And joy the wood and joy the valley fills  Then soon thy bounty swells the golden ear  And bids the harvest crown the fruitful year  Thus all thy works conspicuous worship raise  And Nature's face proclaims her Maker's praise  SONNET APOLOGY FOR RETIREMENT

thou little prisoner sing  Hast thou not cause to grieve  That man unpitying man has rent  From thee the boon which Nature meant  Thou should'st as well as he receive  The power to woo thy partner in the grove  To build where instinct points where chance directs to rove  Perchance unconscious of thy fate  And to the woes of bondage blind  Thou never long'st to join thy mate  Nor wishest to be unconfin'd  Then how relentless he  And fit for every foul offence  Who could bereave such innocence  Of life's best blessing Liberty  Who lur'd thee guileful to his treacherous snare  To live a tuneful slave and dissipate his care  But why for thee this fond complaint  Above thy master thou art blest  Art thou not freeYes calm Content  With olive sceptre sways thy breast  Then deign with me to live  The falcon with insatiate maw  With hooked bill and griping claw  Shall ne'er thy destiny contrive  And every tabby foe shall mew in vain  While pensively demure she hears thy melting strain  Nor shall the fiend fell Famine dare  Thy wiry tenement assail  These these shall be my constant care  The limpid fount and temperate meal  And when the blooming Spring  In checquer'd livery robes the fields  The fairest flowrets Nature yields  To thee officious will I bring  A garland rich thy dwelling shall entwine  And Flora's freshest gifts thrice happy bird be thine  From drear Oblivion's gloomy cave  The powerful Muse shall wrest thy name  And bid thee live beyond the grave  This meed she knows thy merits claim  She knows thy liberal heart  Is ever ready to dispense  The tide of bland Benevolence  And Melody's soft aid impart  Is ready still to prompt the magiclay  Which hushes all our griefs and charms our pains away  Erewhile when brooding o'er my soul  Frown'd the black daemons of Despair  Did not thy voice that power controul  And oft suppress the rising tear  If Fortune should be kind  If e'er with affluence I'm blest  I'll often seek some friend distrest  And when the weeping wretch I find  Then tuneful moralist I'll copy thee  And solace all his woes with social sympathy  ELEGY ON A HUMMINGBIRD  WRITTEN IN A FLOWERGARDEN  BY  A HummingBird by Nature led  On Nature's bounteous honey fed  In every flower beheld a feast  And every sip her charms increas'd  Her plumage various gaudy bright  Surpass'd Aurora's radiant light  Tho' burnish'd o'er with golden rays  As drest in Ariosto's lays  O had you seen her glowing breast  Which every tint by turns exprest  Succeeding tints the past renewing  You had wish'd to be for ever viewing  But sweet inconstant she would fly  From flower to flower and foil the eye  Each motion giving something new  No sooner seen than vanish'd too  One morn on murmuring wing suspended  She to those wellknown pinks descended  Here hung a moment sipt the dew  And elsewhere gaily wanton flew  Her little crimson pinions play'd  As thro' th' enamell'd plain she stray'd  By every fragrant flower invited  Which to delight her seem'd delighted  I saw her in an evilhour  Approach a deepmouth trumpetflower  Within whose fatal tube O me  With mortal dagger lurk'd a bee  Deceitful weed for ever may  Your silthy flower avoid the day  Your nauseous odours taint the morn  Yourself the dire  Thorny Apple of Peru call'd in Virginia The JamesTown Weed  Peruvian Thorn  May you compell'd pernicious bees  Supply your murmuring hives from these  By day restrain your busy flight  Condemn'd to labour in the night  Within her breast secure of harm  The feather'd Venus rais'd alarm  Enrag'd the little jealous thing  And in her neck he plung'd his sting  Say hast thou seen a courser start  An arrow flythe lightning dart  Far swifter wrung with raging pain  The Beauty cleft the airy plain  Her course unsteady high and low  Too well explain'd her inward woe  Her strength decreasing and her speed  Her feeble wings refusing aid  Her tender frame with fevers burn'd  Her little brain to frenzy turn'd  The charm of Nature and the pride  In many circles sunk and died  Her purest nectar erst she drew  From hence here lie her beauties too  Where never flower the wandering eye  Hath since rejoic'd All bards will lie  " The ways of Pleasure promise fair  " But Mischief oft conceal'd lies there"  A MORNING SOLILOQUY ON DEAFNESS  BY  NATURE thy genial call I hear  Which wakes the morn and me  And seems to strike upon my ear  Tho' deaf to all but thee  To me the hours in silence roll away  No music greets the dawn or mourns the close of day  To me the skylarks pois'd aloft  In silence seem to play  And hail no more in warblings soft  The rising dawn of day  For me in vain they swell their liquid throats  Contemplative I muse nor hear the jocund notes  To me the shepherd pipes in vain  In vain the milkmaid sings  Lost are the bleatings of the plain  The gurgling of the springs  No more I hear the nightingale complain  When to the moon she chaunts her sad lovelabour'd strain  And when with me Lucinda strays  Along the breezy grove  In transport on her charms I gaze  And think she talks of love  Ah cease dear maid to talk of love in vain  For smiles alone to me the voice of love explain  Pygmalion thus when he survey'd  The work his hand had form'd  Enamour'd wish'd to see the maid  With mutual passion warm'd  And as he woo'd his ear he oft inclin'd  Whilst yet no voice of love reliev'd his anxious mind  Cease thy complaints methinks ev'n now  The voice of Reason cries  Dispel the gloom that clouds thy brow  Suppress the heaving sighs  What Fate decrees 'tis folly to bewail  Weigh then the good and ill in Wisdom's equal scale  No more in Friendship's thin disguise  Shall Flattery soothe thine ear  Experienc'd kindness makes thee wise  To know thy friend sincere  No more shalt thou attend to Faction's cries  The taunts of jealous Pride or Envy's blasting lyes  No more shall now thy mind be tost  By every breath of praise  No more thy reason shall be lost  In controversy's maze  Thou safe thro' life's sequester'd vale shalt go  And learn from Nature's works her wise decrees to know  THE HERMIT  BY DR GOLDSMITH  " TURN gentle Hermit of the dale  " And guide my lonely way  " To where yon taper chears the vale  " With hospitable ray  " For here forlorn and lost I tread  " With fainting steps and slow  " Where wilds immeasurably spread  " Seem lengthening as I go"  " Forbear my son" the Hermit cries  " To tempt the dangerous gloom  " For yonder faithless phantom flies  " To lure thee to thy doom  " Here to the houseless child of Want  " My door is open still  " And tho' my portion is but scant  " I give it with good will  " Then turn tonight and freely share  " Whate'er my cell bestows  " My rushy couch and frugal fare  " My blessing and repose  " No flocks that range the valley free  " To slaughter I condemn  " Taught by that Power that pities me  " I learn to pity them  " But from the mountain's grassy side  " A guiltless feast I bring  " A scrip with herbs and fruits supply'd  " And water from the spring  " Then pilgrim turn thy cares forego  " All earthborn cares are wrong  " Man wants but little here below  " Nor wants that little long"  Soft as the dew from Heaven descends  His gentle accents fell  The modest stranger lowly bends  And follows to the cell  Far in a wilderness obscure  The lonely mansion lay  A refuge to the neighbouring poor  And strangers led astray  No stores beneath its humble thatch  Requir'd a master's care  The wicket opening with a latch  Receiv'd the harmless pair  And now when busy crowds retire  To take their evening rest  The Hermit trimm'd his little fire  And chear'd his pensive guest  And spread his vegetable store  And gaily prest and smil'd  And skill'd in legendary lore  The lingering hours beguil'd  Around in sympathetic mirth  Its tricks the kitten tries  The cricket chirrups in the hearth  The crackling faggot flies  But nothing could a charm impart  To soothe the stranger's woe  For grief was heavy at his heart  And tears began to flow  His rising cares the Hermit spy'd  With answering care opprest  " And whence unhappy youth" he cry'd  " The sorrows of thy breast  " From better habitations spurn'd  " Reluctant dost thou rove  " Or grieve for friendship unreturn'd  " Or unregarded love  " Alas the joys that fortune brings  " Are trifling and decay  " And those who prize the paltry thing  " More trifling still than they  " And what is Friendship but a name  " A charm that lulls to sleep  " A shade that follows wealth or fame  " And leaves the wretch to weep  " And Love is still an emptier sound  " The modern sairone's jest  " On earth unseen or only found  " To warm the turtles nest  " For shame fond youth thy sorrows hush  " And spurn the sex" he said  But while he spoke a rising blush  His lovelorn guest betray'd  Surpriz'd he sees new beauties rise  Swift mantling to the view  Like colours o'er the morning skies  As bright as transient too  The bashful look the rising breast  Alternate spread alarms  The lovely stranger stands confest  A maid in all her charms  " And ah forgive a stranger rude  " A wretch forlorn" she cry'd  " Whose feet unhallow'd thus intrude  " Where Heaven and you reside  " But let a maid thy pity share  " Whom Love has taught to stray  " Who seeks for rest but finds despair  " Companion of her way  " My father liv'd beside the Tyne  " A wealthy Lord was he  " And all his wealth was mark'd as mine  " He had but only me  " To win me from his tender arms  " Unnumber'd suitors came  " Who prais'd me for imputed charms  " And felt or feign'd a flame  " Each hour a mercenary crowd  " With richest proffers strove  " Among the rest young Edwin bow'd  " But never talk'd of love  " In humble simplest habit clad  " No wealth or power had he  " Wisdom and worth were all he had  " But these were all to me  " The blossom opening to the day  " The dews of heaven refin'd  " Could nought of purity display  " To emulate his mind  " The dew the blossoms of the tree  " With charms inconstant shine  " Their charms were his but woe to me  " Their constancy was mine  " For still I try'd each fickle art  " Importunate and vain  " And while his passion touch'd my heart  " I triumph'd in his pain  " Till quite dejected with my scorn  " He left me to my pride  " And sought a solitude forlorn  " In secret where he died  " But mine the sorrow mine the fault  " And well my life shall pay  " I'll seek the solitude he sought  " And stretch me where he lay  " And there forlorn despairing hid  " I'll lay me down and die  " 'Twas so for me that Edwin did  " And so for him will I"  " Forbid it Heaven" the Hermit cry'd  And clasp'd her to his breast  The wondering fair one turn'd to chide  'Twas Edwin's self that prest  " Turn Angelina ever dear  " My charmer turn to see  " Thy own thy longlost Edwin here  " Restor'd to love and thee  " Thus let me hold thee to my heart  " And every care resign  " And shall we never never part  " My lifemy all that's mine  " No never from this hour to part  " We'll live and love so true  " The sigh that rends thy constant heart  " Shall break thy Edwin's too"  THE BELDAMES  BY  HAIL happy Beldames yours those joys  Which time nor accident destroys  Sickness and cares your bliss dilate  And pain but whets your lust of hate  The flower of Youth will soon decay  Health Beauty Pleasure fade away  Sharp sorrows sting the breast humane  And hopes are false and wishes vain  But hence your joys eternal flow  Their source exhaustless human woe  For you fierce War highpiles his dead  Disease thickstrews her squalid bed  Famine and Plagues their myriads sweep  And Tempests lash th' allwhelming deep  The fiery meteors hear your call  And houses blaze and temples fall  But far remote from Britain's eye  The vaster scenes of ruin lie  The cities in Vulcanos lost  The scatter'd realms in whirlwinds tost  Or feller scourge a Tyrant's brand  Wideflaming o'er a blasted land  Imperfect joy the wretch unknown  Unmark'd the pang unheard the groan  Here mighty Horror scarce appears  One plague perhaps in ninety years  And Faction long depriv'd of food  Sits pining over public good  Or feeds with selftormenting spleen  In present bliss on ills foreseen  But here more exquisite delight  From private woes soothes ranc'rous Spight  In pride of youth our Frederic dies  And Anguish seals my Lonsdale's eyes  Richmond his generous soul resign'd  And Ca'ndish friend to human kind  Ev'n thoughtless  Upon Mr Pelham's death the places of public diversion were for a time deserted  Pleasure droop'd her head  While Britain wept o'er Pelham's bed  Yet such your joys as when the bell  First toll'd unhappy S's knell  When by that hand which thousands sed  The best the bravest Briton bled  And clos'd a lise in virtue past  With one wrong deed his first and last  Whether impure and hard of soul  The Daughter mix'd the deadly bowl  Or if seducing Love betray'd  To crimes unknown the yielding maid  Whether in weakness or in guilt  One joy is sure her blood is spilt  And still to raise the transport higher  Believe her innocent expire  By no degree no sex defin'd  Their Virtues stamp the Beldamekind  Who cringe and slander sting and fawn  In rags or lace or fur or lawn  Whether in perriwigs or pinners  If Whitefield's saints or Arthur's sinners  If now the scold at Wapping flames  Or flaunts a Dutchess at St James'  Alike if they revile or flatter  Who lie in praise will lie in satire  All the foul sisterhood compose  All those and all resembling those  But some in hoary Age's train  By sixty winters chill'd in vain  With hearts that melt and nerves that feel  Display a breast unarm'd with steel  How few are these and of these few  Good Heaven hath seiz'd on Montagu  Germain yet lives not half reveal'd  Her bounties more than half conceal'd  And should I add another name  Blushing she flies pursuing Fame  For such is Virtue's aukward pride  Scarce more intent to give than hide  Peace to all such in silent state  So few scarce worth the Beldame's hate  'Tis not enough that Nature's plan  To Cares to Death predestines Man  That ev'n those few we happy call  Bend to the general doom of all  While bliss a scanty portion flows  Mixt in the stream of bitter woes  Not one escapes the Beldame's hate  Great leveller to one estate  As in the Sun's meridian blaze  A cloud obscene of insects plays  Or with invenom'd sting invades  The quiet of sequester'd shades  Now swarms on filth and now pollutes  The nectar of the fairest fruits  So thro' each rank thro' every stage  Wantons the ceaseless Beldame's rage  Sublimely rapt in patriot heat  Furious she shakes the Monarch's seat  Now stooping spurns the lowly cell  Where calm Content and Concord dwell  Well pleas'd degraded Worth to see  Or Felons load the groaning tree  Yet shall the tear of Pity flow  Yet shall her hand exalt the low  Shall pull aspiring Merit down  And deck the base with Honor's crown  Intent to lower not fond to raise  Hatred her friendship spite her praise  Or when some allrespected name  Highborne upon the tide of Fame  In Glory's pomp resistless draws  A nation breathless in applause  The Beldame loud exalts her voice  And bids a gladden'd world rejoice  Yet then dissembling Art will blend  Th' unwilling censure of a Friend  Lavish in praise she pours her soul  But one Exception damns the whole  Behold the Fiend all pallid stand  A pencil trembling in her hand  See Malice mix the various dies  Of fainter truths and bolder lies  The deepening gloom thick spreads around  And lowering shades the dusky ground  There Sickness blights the cheek of Health  And Beggary soils the robe of Wealth  Here Columns moulder in decay  There Virtue sets with dubious ray  Now heavenly Beauty fades and now  The laurel droops on Valour's brow  Around the Daemon throngs her race  The weak the busy and the base  Eager to copy and disperse  Hence slanderous Prose and ribald Verse  The heaps that crowd Suiila's board  And swell wise Paulo's precious hoard  There Scandal all its store unloads  Ballads and Epigrams and Odes  Stern Party whets her blunted knife  And stabs the Husband thro' the Wife  While Notes historically sage  Fill the broad margin of each Page  Initials dashes well supply'd  And all that fear or shame would hide  Faithful record for future times  To harden by their fathers' crimes  No Beldam Bard with phrenzy sir'd  No prophetess by hell inspir'd  Creative boasts so rich a vein  As swells the Beldame's teeming brain  And mocking study wit and sense  Flows in unletter'd eloquence  Thus beyond Truth's contracted line  Invention's Universe is thine  Thine every tale that Fiction brings  Whether she soars with painted wings  Or plunges in the depths of night  For horrid deeds unknown to light  There should she mark some real blot  Tho' long forgiv'n tho' long forgot  God's cancell'd Grace her rage resumes  The crime rejudg'd the man she dooms  In deeper dyes she spreads the stain  And pitying Heaven relents in vain  Fitly o'er Libya's horrid sand  The javelin arms the Huntsman's hand  Lo where the mangled traveller lies  Drawn by the false Hyaena's cries  And dreadful stalking o'er the plain  The Lion shakes his brindled main  But why shall barbarous Rage invade  The tenant of yon peaceful shade  While issuing with the morning's dawn  Playful she prints the dewy lawn  O why that hostile pomp prepare  To vex the timorous harmless hare  As if some monster yet untam'd  Single a host of Heroes claim'd  While Echo o'er the hills resounds  Horsemen and steeds and horns and hounds  Such nor less eager in their chace  Forth springs the clamorous Beldame race  Harsh Chorus of discordant notes  From yelping tongues and timecrack'd throats  Where lewder Youth outstrips the wind  And limping Eighty lags behind  Yet faithful to the beaten track  The slowpac'd sluggard hunts the pack  Meek Virtue to the covert flies  With panting heart and clouded eyes  Ah spare the gentle coward's fears  Who only answers with her tears  And trembles at imputed sin  Tho' all be innocence within  But Lions to their shaggy breast  Shall fostering press the fearless guest  The sooth'd Hyaena shed a tear  O'er prostrate man with soul sincere  The Priest with hesitating hand  Awhile suspend th' uplifted brand  Ere Pity melts the Beldame's eyes  Glutted with human sacrifice  With liquid fire the goblet crown'd  The livid tapers gleaming round  While Wisdom Valour Beauty sleep  The midnight hags their sabbath keep  And recent from impure delights  Fell Hecat' leads th' infernal rites  O'er her wan cheek diffusely spread  Fierce glares the bright vermillion's red  The borrow'd hair in ringlets flows  Adown her neck of artform'd snows  While baleful drugs in vain renew  Departing Beauty's faded hue  Some spotless name their rage demands  The name rebellowing thro' the bands  Some holy Sage of sainted life  A Virgin pure a faithful Wife  And you who dauntless dar'd to brave  The ruthless foe and threatening wave  Vainly you 'scap'd th' unequal fight  Deep yawns the gulph of deadlier spight  There plung'dth' insatiate Beldames roar  And the wide ruin gapes sor more  Where trees their mantling foliage spread  And roses bend their blooming head  Ye Virgins tread with cautious feet  And cautious pluck the tempting sweet  There lurks the snake with speckled crest  There broods the toad with bloated breast  With poisons dire the reptiles fill'd  From Heaven's transparent dews distill'd  But O more wary trace the maze  Where Youth in frolic pastime plays  There dread the spightswoln Beldame's wrath  Glancing thro' Pleasure's flowery path  And subtle drawing foul offence  From the chaste breath of innocence  Or should the tender bosom yield  Transpierc'd thro' Honor's frailer shield  O Virtue smooth thy brow austere  Accept the penitential tear  Raise the fall'n mourner from the ground  And pour sweet mercy o'er the wound  Nor join these furies in their chace  Nor drive her 'midst that hellish race  Angels shall hear the suppliant's voice  And Beldames howl and Heaven rejoice  Let the obdurate Stoic's pride  Climb the steep mountain's craggy side  Where far remote from mortal ken  Virtue usurps the Tyger's den  And scowling on the crowd below  Nor feels nor pities human woe▪  Let holy zeal with frantic mien  And haggard look and garb obscene  Spurn every gift the Heavens dispense  And pine in sullen abstinence  Yet drink with eager ears and eyes  The tortur'd wretches agonies  Hence hellborn Fiends nor dare bely  The Seraph with indulgent eye  Whence Science beams eternal day  Enlightening millions with her ray  Whence Arts their genial influence spread  O'er smiling Nature's teeming bed  Whence Bounty with extended hand  Scatters her blessings o'er the land  And Love the universal soul  Pervades unites inspires the whole  So Virtue dwelt celestial guest  O Lonsdale in thy spotless breast  Tho' pure as Heaven from moral stain  Tho' torn with unrelenting pain  'Twas thine for others woes to melt  And pardon frailties never felt  While Youth thy gayer converse sought  And Age instructed heard and thought  And thou my Friend for such my claim  And such my best my dearest Fame  Tho' Time with shrivel'd fingers throws  Thick o'er thy head unmingled snows  Still in that eye the spark divine  Shall with unfading lustre shine  Still flow the stream of copious sense  Clear as in Attic eloquence  So thro' the meadow's silver bed  With lilies and with snowdrops spread  Farhonour'd Thames our Britain's pride  Majestic rolls his crystal tide  Where many an ancient brook distils  Its wealth in tributary rills  And in the happy social hour  Well sav'd from state and cares and power  Long may I come a welcome guest  To share the treasures of that breast  Where Spleen ne'er rankled at the heart  Nor Malice lodg'd her rusty dart  ODE TO THE RIVER EDEN  BY DR J LANGHORNE  DElightful Eden parent stream  Yet shall the maids of Memory say  When led by Fancy's fairy dream  My young steps trac'd thy winding way  How oft along thy mazy shore  Where slowly wav'd the willows hoar  In pensive thought their poet stray'd  Or dozing near thy meadow'd side  Beheld thy dimply waters glide  Bright thro' trembling shade  Yet shall they paint those scenes again  Where once with infantjoy he play'd  And bending o'er thy liquid plain  The azure worlds below survey'd  Led by the rosyhanded hours  When Time tript o'er that bank of flowers  Which in thy crystal bosom smil'd  Tho' old the God yet light and gay  He flung his glass his scythe away  And seem'd himself a child  The poplar tall that waving near  Would whisper to thy murmurs free  Yet rustling seems to soothe mine ear  And trembles when I sigh for thee  Yet seated on thy shelving brim  Can Fancy see the Naiads trim  Burnish their green locks in the sun  Or at the last lone hour of day  To chace the lighty glancing jay  In airy circles run  But Fancy can thy mimic power  Again those happy moments bring  Canst thou restore that golden hour  When young Joy wav'd his laughing wing  When first in Eden's rosy vale  My full heart pour'd the lover's tale  The vow sincere devoid of guile  While Delia in her panting breast  With sighs the tender thought supprest  And look'd as angels smile  O Goddess of the crystal brow  That dwell'st the golden meads among  Whose streams still fair in memory flow  Whose murmurs melodize my song  O yet those gleams of joy display  Which brightening glow'd in Fancy's ray  When near thy lucid urn reclin'd  The Dryad Nature bar'd her breast  And left in naked charms imprest  Her image on my mind  In vainthe maids of Memory fair  No more in golden visions play  No friendship smooths the brow of care  No Delia's smile approves my lay  Yet love and friendship lost to me  'Tis yet some joy to think of thee  And in thy breast this moral find  That life tho' stain'd with sorrow's showers  Shall flow serene while Virtue pours  Her sunshine on the mind  ON THE DUTCHESS OF MAZARIN's RETIRING INTO A CONVENT  BY THE SAME  YE holy cares that haunt these lonely cells  These scenes where salutary sadness dwells  Ye sighs that minute the slow wasting day  Ye pale regrets that wear my life away  O bid these passions for the world depart  These wild desires and vanities of heart  Hide every trace of vice of follies past  And yield to Heaven the victory at last  To that the poor remains of life are due  'Tis Heaven that calls and I the call pursue  Lord of my life my future cares are thine  My love my duty greet thy holy shrine  No more my heart to vainer hopes I give  But live for thee whose bounty bids me live  The power that gave these little charms their grace  His favours bounded and confin'd their space  Spite of those charms shall time with rude essay  Tear from the cheek the transient rose away  But the free Mind ten thousand ages past  Its maker's form shall with its maker last  Uncertain objects still our hopes employ  Uncertain all that bears the name of joy  Of all that feels the injuries of fate  Uncertain is the search and short the date  Yet ev'n that boonwhat thousands wish to gain  That boon of Death the sad resource of pain  Once on my path all fortune's glory fell  Her vain magnificence and courtly swell  Love touch'd my soul at least with soft desires  And Vanity there fed her meteor fires  This truth at last the mighty scenes let fall  An hour of Innocence was worth them all  Lord of my life O let thy sacred ray  Shine o'er my heart and break its clouds away  Deluding flattering faithless world adieu  Long hast thou taught me GOD IS ONLY TRUE  That God alone I trust alone adore  No more deluded and misled no more  Come sacred hour when wavering doubts shall cease  Come holy scenes of long repose and peace  Yet shall my heart to other interests true  A moment balance 'twixt the world and you  Of pensive nights of longreflecting days  Be yours at last the triumph and the praise  Great gracious Master whose unbounded sway  Felt thro' ten thousand worlds those worlds obey  Wilt thou for once thy awful glories shade  And deign t' espouse the creature thou hast made  All other ties indignant I disclaim  Dishonour'd those and infamous to name  O fatal ties for which such tears I've shed  For which the pleasures of the world lay dead  That world's soft pleasures you alone disarm  That world without you still might have its charm  But now those scenes of tempting hope I close  And seek the peaceful studies of Repose  Look on the past as time that stole away  And beg the blessings of a happier day  Ye gay saloons ye goldenvested halls  Scenes of high treats and heartbewitching balls  Dress figure splendor charms of play farewel  And all the toilet's science to excel  Ev'n Love that ambush'd in this beauteous hair  No more shall lie like Indian archers there  Go erring Love for nobler objects given  Go beauteous hair a sacrifice to Heaven  Soon shall the veil these glowing features hide  At once the period of their power and pride  The hapless lover shall no more complain  Of vows unheard or unrewarded pain  While calmly sleep in each untortur'd breast  My secret sorrow and his sighs profest  Go fiattering train and slaves to me no more  With the same sighs some happier fair adore  Your alter'd faith I blame not nor bewail  And haply yet what woman is not frail  Yet haply might I calmer minutes prove  If he that lov'd me knew no other love  Yet were that ardor which his breast inspir'd  By charms of more than mortal beauty fir'd  What nobler pride could I to Heaven resign  The zeal the service that I boasted mine  O change your false desires ye flattering train  And love me pious whom ye love profane  These long adieus with lovers doom'd to go  Or prove their merit or my weakness shew  But Heaven to such soft frailties less severe  May spare the tribute of a female tear  May yield one tender moment to deplore  Those gentle hearts that I must hold no more  THE TULIP AND MYRTLE  BY THE SAME  TWAS on the border of a stream  A gailypainted Tulip stood  And gilded by the morning beam  Survey'd her beauties in the flood  And sure more lovely to behold  Might nothing meet the wistful eye  Than crimson fading into gold  In streaks of fairest symmetry  The beauteous flower with pride elate  Ah me that Pride with Beauty dwells  Vainly affects superior state  And thus in empty fancy swells  " O lustre of unrivall'd bloom  " Fair painting of a hand divine  " Superior far to mortal doom  " The hues of Heaven alone are mine  " Away ye worthless formless race  " Ye weeds that boast the name of flowers  " No more my native bed disgrace  " Unmeet for tribes so mean as yours  " Shall the bright daughter of the sun  " Associate with the shrubs of earth  " Ye slaves your sovereign's presence shun  " Respect her beauties and her birth  " And thou dull sullen evergreen  " Shalt thou my shining sphere invade  " My noonday beauties beam unseen  " Obscur'd beneath thy dusky shade"  " Deluded flower" the Myrtle cries  " Shall we thy moment's bloom adore  " The meanest shrub that you despise  " The meanest flower has merit more  " That daisy in its simple bloom  " Shall last along the changing year  " Blush on the snow of winter's gloom  And bid the smiling spring appear  " The violet that those banks beneath  " Hides from thy scorn its modest head  " Shall fill the air with fragrant breath  " When thou art in thy dusty bed  " Ev'n I who boast no golden shade  " Am of no shining tints possest  " When low thy lucld form is laid  " Shall bloom on many a lovely breast  " And he whose kind and fostering care  " To thee to me our beings gave  " Shall near his breast my flowrets wear  " And walk regardless o'er thy grave  " Deluded flower the friendly screen  " That hides thee from the noontide ray  " And mocks thy passion to be seen  " Prolongs thy transitory day  " But kindly deeds with scorn repaid  " No more by Virtue need be done  " I now withdraw my dusky shade  " And yield thee to thy darling sun"  Fierce on the flower the scorching beam  With all its weight of glory fell  The flower exulting caught the gleam  And lent its leaves a bolder swell  Expanded by the searching fire  The curling leaves the breast disclos'd  The mantling bloom was painted higher  And every latent charm expos'd  But when the sun was sliding low  And evening came with dews so cold  The wanton beauty ceas'd to blow  And sought her bending leaves to fold  Those leaves alas no more will close  Relax'd exhausted sickening pale  They left her to a parent's woes  And fled before the rising gale  RURAL SIMPLICITY AN ODE  BY THE SAME  O Thou whom Love and Fancy lead  To wander near this woodland hill  If ever music sooth'd thy quill  Or pity wak'd thy gentle reed  Repose beneath my humble tree  If thou lov'st Simplicity  Stranger if thy lot has laid  In toilsome scenes of busy life  Full sorely may'st thou see the strife  Of weary passions ill repaid  In a garden live like me  If thou lov'st Simplicity  Flowers have sprung for many a year  O'er the villagemaiden's grave  That one memorialsprig to save  Bore it from a sister's bier  And homeward walking wept o'er me  The true tears of Simplicity  And soon her cottagewindow near  With care my slender stem she plac'd  And fondly thus her Grief embrac'd  And cherish'd sad Remembrance dear  For Love sincere and Friendship free  Are children of Simplicity  When past was many a painful day  Slowpacing o'er the villagegreen  In white were all its maidens seen  And bore my guardian friend away  Ah Death what sacrifice to thee  The ruins of Simplicity  One generous swain her heart approv'd  A youth whose fond and faithful breast  With many an artless sigh confest  In Nature's language that he lov'd  But Stranger 'tis no tale for thee  Unless thou lov'st Simplicity  He diedand soon her lip was cold  And soon her rosy lip was pale  The village wept to hear the tale  When for both the slow bell toll'd  Beneath yon flowery turf they lie  The lovers of Simplicity  Yet one boon have I to crave  Stranger if thy pity bleed  Wilt thou do one tender deed  And  ew my pale flowers o'er their grave  So lightly lie the turf on thee  Because thou lov'st Simplicity  WRITTEN ON A CHINESE TEMPLE IN MR SCOTT'S GARDEN AT AMWELL  BY THE SAME  TO scenes where Taste and Genius dwell  Unwillingly we bid farewell  For these of more than mortal birth  Strangers and sojourners on earth  Have far from

melodious lyre  To strains divine the British Petrarch strung  Wilt thou thy long revolted bard inspire  And wake lost memory to the lays he sung  Ah no no more with sighs of pensive love  No more with sorrow fill his melting strain  Else other woes my passive heart would prove  My eyes would weep with Lytleton again  But should he now by nobler motives fir'd  Unfold the riper treasures of his

more to female merit blind  Admire the person but adore the mind  To these weak strains O thou the sex's friend  And constant patron  The author of those three celebrated works Pamela Clarissa and Sir Charles Grandison  Richardson attend  Thou who so oft with pleas'd but anxious care  Hast watch'd the dawning genius of the fair  With wonted smiles wilt hear thy friend display  The various graces of the female lay  Studious from Folly's yoke their minds to free  And aid the generous cause espous'd by thee  Long o'er the world did Prejudice maintain  By sounds like these her undisputed reign  " Woman she cried to thee indulgent Heaven  " Has all the charms of outward beauty given  " Be thine the boast unrival'd to enslave  " The great the wise the witty and the brave  " Deck'd with the Paphian rose's damask glow  " And the valelily's vegetable snow  " Be thine to move majestic in the dance  " To roll the eye and aim the tender glance  " Or touch the strings and breathe the melting song  " Content to emulate that airy throng  " Who to the sun their painted plumes display  " And gaily glitter on the hawthorn spray  " Or wildly warble in the beechen grove  " Careless of aught but music joy and love"  Heavens could such artful slavish sounds beguile  The freeborn sons of Britain's polish'd isle  Could they like fam'd Ulysses' dastard crew  Attentive listen and enamour'd view  Nor drive the Syren to that dreary plain  In loathsome pomp where eastern tyrants reign  Where each fair neck the yoke of slavery galls  Clos'd in a proud seraglio's gloomy walls  And taught that

Since oft that heir with prudence has been known  To dread a genius that transcends his own  The wise themselves should with discretion chuse  Since letter'd nymphs their knowledge may abuse  And husbands oft experience to their cost  The prudent housewife in the scholar lost  But those incur deserv'd contempt who prize  Their own high talents and their sex despise  With haughty mien each social bliss defeat  And sully all their learning with conceit  Of such the parent justly warns his son  And such the muse herself will bid him shun  But lives there one whose unassuming mind  Tho' grac'd by nature and by art refin'd  Pleas'd with domestic excellence can spare  Some hours from studious ease to social care  And with her pen that time alone employs  Which others waste in visits

keep your bright example still in view  " These lasting beauties will in youth engage  " And smooth the wrinkles of deelining age  " Secure to bloom unconscious of decay  " When all Corinna's roses fade away  " For ev'n when love's short triumph shall be o'er  " When youth shall please and beauty charm no more  " When man shall cease to slatter when the eye  " Shall cease to sparkle and the heart to sigh  " In that dread hour when parent dust shall claim  " The lifeless tribute of each kindred frame  " Ev'n then shall wisdom for her chosen fair  " The fragrant wreaths of virtuous fame prepare  " Those wreaths which flourish in a happier clime  " Beyond the reach of envy and of time  " While here th' immortalizing muse shall save  " Your darling names from dark Oblivion's grave  " Those names the praise and wonder shall engage  " Of every polish'd wise and virtuous age  " To latest times our annals shall adorn  " And save from folly thousands yet unborn"  ODE TO THE HON JOHN

Where the elm expands the shade  And each rising beauty blows  There I'll say in peace of mind  " Empty greatness fall behind"  Teach thy votary all the powers  Of each plant and every tree  Tell how shortliv'd are the flowers  Bring the moral home to me  Bid me fleeting life despise  Make me humble make me wise  Pride within my lowly cell  Never yet uprear'd her head  Solitude with thee I'll

bounteous to bestow  A mind that melted at another's woe  Studious to act the selfapproving part  That midnight music of the honest heart  These silent joys th' illustrious youth possest  This cloudless sunshine of th' unsullied breast  From pride of peerage and from folly free  Life's early morn fair Virtue gave to thee  The tear no longer stole from Sorrow's eye  And Poverty rejoic'd when he was nigh  Like Titus knew the value of a day  And Want went smiling from his gates away  Titles and rank are borrow'd from the throne  These honours Egerton were all thy own  THE AFRICAN PRINCE NOW IN ENGLAND TO ZARA AT HIS FATHER'S COURT WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCXLIX  BY DR DODD  PRINCES my fair unfortunately great  Born to the pompous vassalage of state  Whene'er the public calls are doom'd to sly  Domestic bliss and break the private tie  Fame pays with empty breath the toils they bear  And love's soft joys are chang'd for glorious care  Yet conscious virtue in the silent hour  Rewards the hero with a noble dower  For this alone I dar'd the roaring sea  Yet more for this I dar'd to part with thee  But while my bosom feels the nobler flame  Still unreprov'd it owns thy gentler claim  Tho' virtue's awful form my soul approves  'Tis thine thine only Zara that it loves  A private lot had made the claim but one  The prince alone must love for virtue shun  Ah why distinguish'd from the happier crowd  To me the bliss of millions disallow'd  Why was I singled for imperial sway  Since love and duty point a different way  Fix'd the dread voyage and the day decreed  When duty's victim love was doom'd to bleed  Too well my memory can these scenes renew  We met to sigh to weep our last adieu  That conscious palm beneath whose towering shade  So oft our vows of mutual love were made  Where hope so oft anticipated joy  And plann'd of future years the best employ  That palm was witness to the tears we shed  When that fond hope and all those joys were fled  Thy trembling lips with trembling lips I prest  And held thee panting to my panting breast  Our sorrow grown too mighty to sustain  Now snatch'd us fainting from the sense of pain  Together sinking in the trance divine  I caught thy fleeting soul and gave thee mine  O blest oblivion of tormenting care  O why recall'd to life and to despair  The dreadful summons came to partand why  Why not the kinder summons but to die  To die together were to part no more  To land in safety on some peaceful shore  Where love's the business of immortal life  And happy spirits only guess at strife  " If in some distant land my prince should find  " Some nymph more fair you cried as Zara kind"  Mysterious doubt which could at once impart  Relief to mine and anguish to thy heart  Still let me triumph in the fear exprest  The voice of love that whisper'd in thy breast  Nor call me cruel for my truth shall prove  'Twas but the vain anxiety of love  Torn from thy fond embrace the strand I gain  Where mourning friends inflict superfluous pain  My father there his struggling sighs supprest  And in dumb anguish clasp'd me to his breast  Then sought conceal'd the conflict of his mind  To give the sortitude he could not find  Each lifetaught precept kindly he renew'd  " Thy country's good said he be still pursued  " If when the gracious gods my son restore  " These eyes shall sleep in death to wake no more  " If then these limbs that now in age decay  " Shall mouldering mix with earth's parental clay  " Round my green tomb perform the sacred rite  " Assume my throne and let thy yoke be light  " From lands of freedom glorious precepts bring  " And reign at once a father and a king"  How vainly proud the arrogantly great  Presume to boast a monarch's godlike state  Subject alike the peasant and the king  To life's dark ills and care's corroding sting  From guilt and fraud that strikes in silence sure  No shield can guard us and no arms secure  By these my fair subdued thy prince was lost  A naked captive on a barbarous coast  Nurtur'd in ease a thousand servants round  My wants prevented and my wishes crown'd  No painful labours stretch'd the tedious day  On downy feet my moments danc'd away  Wheree'er I look'd officious courtiers bow'd  Wheree'er I pass'd a shouting people crowd  No fears intruded on the joys I knew  Each man my friend my lovely mistress you  What dreadful change abandon'd and alone  The shouted prince is now a slave unknown  To watch his eye no bending courtiers wait  No hailing crowds proclaim his regal state  A slave condemn'd with unrewarded toil  To turn from morn to eve a burning soil  Fainting beneath the sun's meridian heat  Rouz'd by the scourge the taunting jest I meet  " Thanks to thy friends they cry whose care recalls  " A prince to life in whom a nation falls"  Unwholesome scraps my strength but half sustain'd  From corners glean'd and ev'n by dogs disdain'd  At night I mingled with a wretched crew  Who by long use with woe familiar grew  Of manners brutish merciless and rude  They mock'd my sufferings and my pangs renew'd  In groans not sleep I pass'd the weary night  And rose to labour with the morning light  Yet thus of dignity and ease beguil'd  Thus scorn'd and scourg'd insulted and revil'd  If Heaven with thee my faithful arms had blest  And fill'd with love my intervals of rest  Short tho' they were my soul had never known  One secret wish to glitter on a throne  The toilsome day had heard no sigh of mine  Nor stripes nor scorn had urg'd me to repine  A monarch still beyond a monarch blest  Thy love my diadem my throne thy breast  My courtiers watchful of my looks thy eyes  Should shine persuade and flatter and advise  Thy voice my music and thy arms should be  Ah not the prison of a slave in me  Could I with infamy content remain  And wish thy lovely form to share my chain  Could this bring ease forgive th' unworthy thought  And let the love that sinn'd atone the fault  Could I a slave and hopeless to be free  Crawl tamely recent from the scourge to thee  Thy blooming beauties could these arms embrace  My gullty joys enslave an infant race  No rather blast me lightnings whirlwind tear  And drive these limbs in atoms thro' the air  Rather than this O curse me still with life  And let my Zara smile a rival's wife  Be mine alone th' accumulated woe  Nor let me propagate my curse below  But from this dreadful scene with joy I turn  To trust in Heaven of me let Zara learn  The wretch the sordid hypocrite who sold  His charge an unsuspecting prince for gold  That Justice mark'd whose eyes can never sleep  And death commission'd smote him on the deep  The generous crew their port in safety gain  And tell my mournful tale nor tell in vain  The king with horror of th' atrocious deed  In haste commanded and the slave was freed  No more Britannia's cheek the blush of shame  Burns for my wrongs her king restores her fame  Propitious gales to Freedom's happy shore  Waft me triumphant and the prince restore  Whate'er is great and gay around me shine  And all the splendor of a court is mine  Here knowledge too by piety refin'd  Sheds a blest radiance o'er my brightening mind  From earth I travel upward to the sky  I learn to live to reign yet more to die  O I have tales to tell of love divine  Such blissful tidings they shall soon be thine  I long to tell thee what amaz'd I see  What habits buildings trades and polity  How art and nature vie to entertain  In public shows and mix delight with pain  O Zara  He alludes to the Play of Oroonoko at which he was present and so affected as to be unable to continue during its performance in the house  here a story like my own  With mimic skill in borrow'd names was shown  An Indian chief like me by fraud betray'd  And partner in his woes an Indian maid  I can't recal the scenes 'tis pain too great  And if recall'd should shudder to relate  To write the wonders here I strive in vain  Each word would ask a thousand to explain  The time shall come O speed the lingering hour  When Zara's charms shall lend description power  When plac'd beside thee in the cool alcove  Or thro' the green Savannahs as we rove  The frequent kiss shall interrupt the tale  And looks shall speak my sense tho' language fail  Then shall the prodigies that round me rise  Fill thy dear bosom with a sweet surprize  Then all my knowledge to thy faithful heart  With danger gain'd securely I'll impart  Methinks I see thy changing looks express  Th' alternate sense of pleasure and distress  As all the windings of my fate I trace  And wing thy fancy swift from place to place  Yet where alas has flattering thoughts convey'd  The ravish'd lover with his darling maid  Between us still unmeasur'd oceans roll  Which hostile barks infest and storms controul  Be calm my bosom since th' unmeasur'd main  And hostile barks and storms are God's domain  He rules resistless and his power shall guide  My life in safety o'er the roaring tide  Shall bless the love that's built on virtue's base  And spare me to evangelize my race  Farewell thy prince still lives and still is free  Farewell hope all things and remember me  ZARA AT THE COURT OF ANAMABOE TO THE AFRICAN

the glowing line  Would not my prince with nobler warmth disdain  That love as languid which could stoop to feign  Let guilt dissemblein my faithful breast  Love reigns unblam'd and be that love confest  I give my bosom naked to thy view  For what has shame with innocence to do  In fancy now I clasp thee to my heart  Exchange my vows and all my joys impart  I catch new transport from thy speaking eye  But whence this sad involuntary sigh  Why pants my bosom with intruding fears  Why from my eyes distil unbidden tears  Why do my hands thus tremble as I write  Why fades thy lov'd idea from my sight  O art thou safe on Britain's happy shore  From winds that bellow and from seas that roar  And has my princeOh more than mortal pain  Betray'd by ruffians felt the captive's chain  Bound were those limbs ordain'd alone to prove  The toils of empire and the sweets of love  Hold hold Barbarians of the fiercest kind  Fear Heaven's red lightning'tis a prince ye bind  A prince whom no indignities could hide  They knew presumptuous and the gods defied  Wheree'er he moves let lovejoin'd reverence rise  And all mankind behold with Zara's eyes  Thy breast alone when bounding o'er the waves  To Freedom's climes from slavery and slaves  Thy breast alone the pleasing thought could frame  Of what I felt when thy dear letters came  A thousand times I held them to my breast  A thousand times my lips the paper prest  My full heart panted with a joy too strong  And "Oh my prince" died faultering on my tongue  Fainting I sunk unequal to the strife  And milder joys sustain'd returning life  Hope sweet enchantress round my lovesick head  Delightful scenes of blest delusion spread  " Come come my prince my charmer haste away  " Come come I cried thy Zara blames thy stay  " For thee the shrubs their richest sweets retain  " For thee new colours wait to paint the plain  " For thee cool breezes linger in the grove  " The birds expect thee in the green alcove  " Till thy return the rills sorget to fall  " Till thy return the sun the soul of all  " He comes my maids in his meridian charms  " He comes refulgent to his Zara's arms  " With jocund songs proclaim my love's return  " With jocund hearts his nuptial bed adorn  " Bright as the sun yet gentle as the dove  " He comes uniting majesty and love"  Too soon alas the blest delusion flies  Care swells my breast and sorrow fills my eyes  Ah why do thy fond words suggest a fear  Too vast too numerous those already here  Ah why with doubts torment my bleeding breast  Of seas which storms controul and foes insest  My heart in all this tedious absence knows  No thoughts but those of seas and storms and foes  Each joyless morning with the rising sun  Quick to the strand my feet spontaneous run  " Where where's my prince what tidings have ye brought"  Of each I met with pleading tears I sought  In vain I sought some conscious of my pain  With horrid silence pointed to the main  Some with a sneer the brutal thought exprest  And plung'd the dagger of a barbarous jest  Day follow'd day and still I wish'd the next  New hopes still flatter'd and new doubts perplex'd  Day follow'd day the wish'd tomorrow came  My hopes doubts fears anxieties the same  At length"O Power Supreme whoe'er thou art  " Thy shrine the sky the sea the earth or heart  " Since every clime and all th' unbounded main  " And hostile barks and storms are thy domain  " If faithful passion can thy bounty move  " And goodness sure must be the friend of love  " Safe to these arms my lovely prince restore  " Safe to his Zara's arms to part no more  " O grant to virtue thy protecting care  " And grant thy love to love's availing prayer  " Together then and emulous to praise  " A flowery altar to thy name we'll raise  " There first and last on each returning day  " To thee our vows of gratitude we'll pay"  Fool that I was to all my comfort blind  Why when thou went'st did Zara stay behind  How could I fondly hope one joy to prove  'Midst all the wild anxieties of love  Had fate in other mold thy Zara form'd  And my bold breast in manly friendship warm'd  How had I glow'd exulting at thy side  How all the shafts of adverse fate defied  Or yet a woman and not nerv'd for toil  With thee O had I turn'd a burning soil  In the cold prison had I lain with thee  In love still happy we had still been free  Then fortune brav'd had own'd superior might  And pin'd with envy while we forc'd delight  Why shouldst thou bid thy love remember thee  Thine all my thoughts have been and still shall be  Each night the cool Savannahs have I sought  And breath'd the fondness of enamour'd thought  The curling breezes murmur'd as I sigh'd  And hoarse at distance roar'd my soe the tide  My breast still haunted by a motly train  Now doubts now hopes prevail'd now joy now pain  Now fix'd I stand my spirit fled to thine  Nor note the time nor see the sun decline  Now rouz'd I start and wing'd with fear I run  In vain alas for 'tis myself I shun  When kindly sleep its lenient balm supplied  And gave that comfort waking thought denied  Last nightbut why ah Zara why impart  The fond fond fancies of a lovesick heart  Yet true delights on fancy's wings are brought  And love's soft raptures realiz'd in thought  Last night I saw methinks I see it now  Heaven's awful concave round thy Zara bow  When sudden thence a flaming chariot flew  Which earth receiv'd and six white coursers drew  Thenquick transitiondid thy Zara ride  Borne to the chariotwonderousby thy side  All glorious both from clime to clime we flew  Each happy clime with sweet surprize we view  A thousand voices sung"All bliss betide  " The prince of Lybia and his faithful bride"  " 'Tis done 'tis done" resounded thro' the skies  And quick aloft the car began to rise  Ten thousand beauties crowded on my sight  Ten thousand glories beam'd a dazzling light  My thoughts could bear no more the vision fled  And wretched Zara view'd her lonely bed  Come sweet interpreter and ease my soul  Come to my bosom and explain the whole  Alas my princeyet hold my struggling breast  Sure we shall meet again again be blest  " Hope all thou say'st I live and still am free"  O then prevent those hopes and haste to me  Ease all the doubts thy Zara's bosom knows  And kindly stop the torrent of her woes  But that I know too well thy generous heart  One doubt than all more torment would impart  'Tis this in Britain's happy courts to shine  Amidst a thousand blooming maids is thine  But thou a thousand blooming maids among  Art still thyself incapable of wrong  No outward charm can captivate thy mind  Thy love is friendship heighten'd and refin'd  'Tis what my soul and not my form inspires  And burns with spotless and immortal fires  Thy joys like mine from conscious truth arise  And known these joys what others canst thou prize  Be jealous doubts the curse of sordid minds  Hence jealous doubts I give ye to the winds  Once more O come and snatch me to thy arms  Come shield my beating heart from vain alarms  Come let me hang enamour'd on thy breast  Weep pleasing tears and be with joy distrest  Let me still hear and still demand thy tale  And oft renew'd still let my suit prevail  Much still remains to tell and to enquire  My hand still writes and writing prompts desire  My pen denies my last farewell to write  Still still "return" my wishful thoughts indite  O hear my prince thy love thy mistress call  Think o'er each tender name and hear by all  O pleasing intercourse of soul with soul  Thus while I write I see I clasp thee whole  And these kind letters trembling Zara drew  In every line shall bring her to thy view  Return return in love and truth excell  Return I write I cannot addFarewell  HYMN TO HOPE  BY THE SAME  ALL hail bright Hope Thou when the fatal box  Replete with ills was sent by angry Jove  In punishment of Japhet's  Prometheus  daring son  When every woe of fearful name flew forth  To vex the human race thou kindly deign'dst  To stay behind man's gentle comforter  Life's balm and blessing or without the aid  Of truthassimilated fiction thou  Wast given by God himself a chearing light  To guide man's feet driv'n from fair Eden's groves  Across the untrack'd wilderness of life  To Heaven's blest mansions where and where alone  Thy office friendly Hope shall sweetly cease  To full fruition yielded But on earth  Nay not perchance ev'n in fair Eden's groves  Are thy assuasive consolations vain  For what is life or what its highest scenes  Of boasted happiness if present bliss  Bounds the horizon of our views nor Hope  With eagle eye kens aught beyond on which  To fix the future ardent heart's desire  To fill the soul and make the rapid wish  Run o'er with plentitude of joyVain vain  To man's felicity in youth or age  The present draught of pleasure tho' once wish'd  With all the eagerness of panting thirst  Deep deep he drinks and longs for more From hope  To hope he springs he views and still extends  His view o'er cloudcapt Alps new Alps arise  He gains the summit still the prospect wide  Enlarges to his eye forward he fares  Nor ceases to ascend till high in heaven  He rides at anchor and then Hope's no more  But O thou general blessing smiling Hope  Thy lucid ray not only leads us on  From view to view not only dost thou chear  With expectation sweet of future good  But with serenity of present bliss  Thou fill'st the heart expectant Hope can give  Habitual goodhumour To the soul  A vital heat she quickens the still parts  Nay ev'n in motion keeps the springs of life  And when most indolent and most remiss  Or rouzes or preserves the mind awake  See too how fewand ev'n those few how short  Are actual enjoyments But thro' thee  Blest Hope we gain a taste delicious taste  Of pleasures possible Taste not less sweet  Perchance than real for kind Hope bestows  A bliss in expectation not less full  And fuller oft than ripe fruition brings  Fruition haughty nymph she never deigns  To walk with humble Hope who at her sight  Retires abash'd unnotic'd and unthank'd  But O blest comforter ingrate to thee  Let me not ever prove should wish'd success  Crown my heart's hope let me not e'er forget  The dear indulgences thy soothing views  Have to my soul presented Yet O yet  Thy promis'd consummation too too long  Delay'd the heart in deep despondence sighs  And sickens sad with care O then indulge  Thy votary's prayer nor ever let me lose  Thy chearing aspect never let the night  Of black despondence with its dismal veil  My little prospects in thick darkness wrap  Nor yet too long delay to grant my wish  Accomplishment if worthy So my soul  Invigorated still shall onward press  To more and more improvement nor grow faint  Till the big buds of Hope terrestrial burst  To blossoms full and fair in better climes  But say bright Hope what numbers shall be found  Worthy to sing thy praise for that thy hand  Not only to the happiest life imparts  Its zest its relish but with tender care  Is stretch'd forth to assuage the wretch's woe  To soothe the anguish of disease and pain  And soften sad adversity's rough bed  Thou only cheap and universal cure  Of human illsof human sorrow thou  Best comforter and oft full oft alas  The only comforter the wretched find  Ah see from that unfortunate o'erwhelm'd  In the deep gulph of sorrow with what speed  What cruel speed as from contagion all  With one consent are flyingand will none  For gentle pity's sake remain behind  To comfort the diftrest Yes faithful Hope  Benevolently stays and flatterer kind  Her farforeseeing tube applies thro' which  The eye tho' dim with mourning oft discerns  Future and happier days thro' the black gloom  Of melancholy prospects shining bright  Ah honest flattereryes for once the muse  Commends what most the worthy mind abhors  And calls thee honest flatterer for while all  Assiduous join to adulate the blest  Hope tender Hope alone with soft concern  Flatters th' unhappy and when every friend  Flies from the shipwreck'd naked ruin'd wretch  When every woe in dire array crowds round  Ev'n then in that sad hour Hope still remains  As loth to leave divine philanthrophist  Her labour of disinterested love  Seewith those anxious sailors  This refers to a real event which happened two winters past These mariners when their vessel was sunk continued two days and nights on the mast where they found an accidental keg of brandy which under God preserved their lives till a vessel from Margate came with great hazard to their preservation the person who first saw the vessel immediately fainted away  see her watch  Her eye almost exhausted on the mast  The topmast of yon high Admiral  Just peeping from those waves that have ingulph'd  The gallant vessel with its hapless crew  Save those who sit as if for bitterer fate  Reserv'd long wakeful nights and anxious days  High on the topmast fearing instant death  From each insulting wave yet yet not yet  Will Hope desert them See she strains her eye  Far o'er the trackless occan see she looks  With eager expectation looks around  Wild winds alone are heard green waves alone  Foaming with fury are beheld O Hope  Blest Hope forsake them not should'st thou forsake  And from the top mast fly they fall they sink  Irrevocably lostShe will not go  Still will she watch nor watch in vain she spies  A white sail rising from the waves it comes  Behold it comes and in its bosom bears  Thriceprecious life They faint for joy their feet  Scarce bear them trembling to the welcome bark  Where safely boardedHope her golden wings  Plumes and exulting shoots across the deep  Quick as in winter's skies the radiant star  But whither thus precipitate her flight  Urges the general comforter Behold  Where stretch'd upon the bed of sore disease  Worn out with pain the sick man languid lies  She comes blest Hope and lo her kindly arm  Rears from the pillow his enfeebled head  And lenient sooths his melancholy heart  Now pointing to fair Health with roseate bloom  Rekindling vigour in the mantling cheek  Now to the robe of white and crown of gold  Reserv'd for Christ's true servants in the realms  Of everlasting dayThrice faithful Hope  Thou like the heart liv'st first and diest last  Nor ev'n in death's extremest pangs wilt leave  The fluttering soulbut when earth's fears and joys  Sink into darkness all thy beaming light  Unvelopes prospects new and better far  Prospects which make man man and cause the soul  In death to triumph and defy the grave  Nor ceases with the man of sorrow stretch'd  On bed of sickness Hore's indulgent aid  The balm of comfort see how she presents  To the dear tender partner of his heart  The wife with weeping love beside the couch  Watching solicitous with sleepless eye  Hope shews her the fond husband to her arms  Once more restor'd Hope to her aching heart  The valued parent represents once more  Smiling amidst his children and endear'd  As thus endanger'd tenfold more endear'd  Look thro' the varied scenes of hapless life  Hope allbeneficent is ever found  Wheree'er is found affliction None so low  Can sink but Hope will to their wretchedness  Descend and point out consolation's star  Bright'ning in better skies not ev'n the slave  Loaden with cruel chains deep in the mines  Of rich Potosi toiling though from light  Ever sequester'd of allcheering day  Can from her light be hid See through his soul  It shoots illuminating and affords  Bright blessing glances of his native land  Recover'd freedom and rejoicing friends  All hail bright Hope O thro' the weary ways  Of this bad world be thou the pilgrim's staff  On which my hands may lean and find support  'Gainst all despondency yet Goddess say  While on thy altars all of human race  Devoutly sacrifice while to thy shrine  All mortals bend the knee whence doth it hap  That oft the mournful tongue proclaims thee false  And dares to desecrate thy hallow'd name  Deceitful calling thee and apt to slide  Full oft from the embrace ev'n in the hour  Of highest expectation often found  To promise what thou never dost bestow  " Vain mortalsyes with serious solemn heed  I mark thy words celestial"Mortals know  " 'Tis not in Hope 'tis in yourselves deceiv'd  " And still deceiving that the error lies  " Shortliv'd and of a span ye stretch your hopes  " Proud hopes of sublunary happiness  " Far into time as if of time secure  " As if on earth immortal or those hopes  " On objects fix incapable to bless  " When granted to your wishes or more vain  " By selfdelusion blinded fancyled  " Ye idly hope where reason's self recoils  " Thus rendering your existence dream at best  " Still more a dreamLess credulous and fond  " Mortals bewise either as mortals hope  " Or still more wise hope as immortals" Yes  With sacred awe thy counsel I receive  Blest teacher O assist me to obey  Its dictates far above this waning moon  Teach me to rise o'er momentary bliss  Triumphant and to soar on thy bright wings  Beyond the lessen'd clouds beyond all time  Deep into vast immensity where thou  Tho' born of immortality and proof  Of thy high parent's glorywhere ev'n thou  Earth's blessingnever never shalt be known  Then farewell Hope for everthen adieu  Sweet expectation when each ravish'd sense  Lives in the plenitude of God's own joy  But till that hour O deign allcheering Hope  To smile before me gild my prospects round  With thy reviving splendor full in view  Present the vast realities which wait  Th' immortal stranger travelling from this world  To his eternal home his rest his haven  So shall my heart ne'er with impatient throbs  Pant for th' uncertain sublunary gifts  Of this e'erchanging life So Reason's hand  With Fortitude attending on shall lead  To the neat cottage of retir'd Content  Where dwells man's truest happiness there lodg'd  Like Caesar with a generous disdain  Present possessions nobly I'll despise  And from them frankly part in the full hope  Hope which can ne'er deceive nor mount too high  Hope of possessions future better far  Boundless duration bliss immutable  Hail then bright Hope of immortality  True genuine daughter hail man's chiefest good  And his best portion while no mor than man  Smile o'er the human race and still vouchsafe  To gild to gladden all their joys to soothe  With gentle blandishment their woes to fill  With just contempt of transitory life  Still realizing to their raptur'd view  Heaven's high felicities O while strong Faith  With steady finger points us to our home  Do thou invigorate our active feet  Along the rugged way full sull in sight  Place that home's glories while thy sister Love  Charms us the while the weary journey through  And when it ends receive us from the arms  Of Faith and thee to take up our abode  In realms where GOD and LOVE are all in all  VERSES OCCASIONED BY A PRESENT OF A MOSS ROSEBUD FROM MISS JACKSON OF SOUTHGATE  BY THE SAME  THE slightest of favours bestow'd by the fair  With rapture we take and with transport we wear  But a MOSSWOVEN ROSEBUD Eliza from thee  A wellpleasing gift to a monarch would be  Ah that illness too cruel forbidding should stand  And refuse me the gift from thine own lovely hand  With joy I receive it with pleasure will view  Reminded of thee by its odour and hue  " Sweet rose let me tell thee tho' charming thy bloom  " Tho' thy fragrance exceeds Saba's richest perfume  " Thy breath to Eliza's hath no fragrance in't  " And thy bloom is but dull to her cheeks blushing tint  " Yet alas my fair flower that bloom will decay  " And all thy fine beauties soon wither away  " Tho' pluck'd by her hand to whose touch thou must own  " Harsh and rough is the cygnet's most delicate down  " Thou too snowy handnay I mean not to preach  " But the Rose lovely moralist suffer to teach"  " Extol not fond maiden thy beauties o'er mine  " They too are shortliv'd and they too must decline  " And small in conclusion the difference appears  " In the bloom of few days or the bloom of few years  " But remember a virtue the Rose hath to boast  " Its Fragrance remains when its Beauties are lost"  THE EQUALITY OF MANKIND  BY MR WODHULL  THERE was a time when from those hapless schools  Where Science droops and pension'd Litchfield rules  Inhaling faction with the Tory race  On Right Divine Hereditary Grace  Much did I waver much did I unite  The names of Patriot and of Jacobite  Thanks to my friendly stars those days are o'er  And now not meanly pinion'd as before  Untaught to bend the pliant knee and join  The slaves who flock to Grandeur's tinsel shrine  Kindling at thy perpetual flame the brand  Of honest Satire with officious hand  To thee O Truth I consecrate the blaze  Receive exalt invigorate my lays  The studious Pilgrim as his bare feet tread  O'er holy Carmel with religious dread  If sunk in mouldering rubbish he descries  Where some old fane or massive altar lies  Kneeling adores it with a stedfast gaze  And ruminates the works of mightier days  Feasts his rapt soul on pure devotion's fires  And slowly from the muchlov'd spot retires  Led by dark Legend on from clime to clime  Amid th' historic ravages of Time  Thus the bold Muse asserts her liberal plan  To mark the genuine privilege of man  To prove how Fiction and how Fact agree  That God was just and all Mankind were free  From Jura's mount from those inclement skies  Where pale and wan Helvetia's Genius lies  His arms revers'd his shield thrown idly by  To note the sad decays of Liberty  Come stern Philosophythat garb of woe  Befits thee most majestically slow  Thy gait while rais'd aloof thy red right hand  Waves in the gale Resentment's flaming brand  Such as from Seine's proud banks when Rosseau fled  Thy Vengeance hurl'd at mitred Beaumont's head  Beneath thy auspices in Albion's plain  While Justice triumphs in a George's reign  Alone yet scorning Caution's coward mask  Will I encounter this adventurous task  Tho' far too sanguine to conceal their rage  My Foes already curse each opening page  And Friends half shrinking at so rude a test  Glance o'er my title and forswear the rest  Back to Creation's infancy when Earth  Few revolutions dated from its birth  My theme invitespoor Exile doom'd to rove  Far from the sweets of Eden's happy grove  Behold our first Progenitorhis race  Plung'd in a lineal series of disgrace  Become a prey from that illfated hour  To pain disease and death's remorseless power  Some evils soon attain'd their utmost prime  To perfect others was a work of time  Perhaps in those rude ages when no law  Kept the warm passions of mankind in awe  Rapine was frequent from his neighbour's fold  Some proud Oppressor of gigantic mold  His fleecy charge his only treasure bore  And left the shepherd weltering in his gore  Yet then no dire necessity had made  Murder a system war a needful trade  No Frederick foe to nature and to man  Justice his pretext tyranny his plan  Born every right of nations to betray  O'er Leipzick's walls had forc'd his desperate way  Coarse was their food their sordid dwelling small  Such was the lot of one the lot of all  In some deep vale their shapeless altar stood  Rais'd with the casual turf or unhewn wood  Thither by grateful adoration taught  On some choice festival the Rustic brought  A decent offering from his little stock  Fruits of the ground or firstlings of his flock  No temple rear'd its fretted roof on high  No golden censer's blaze persum'd the sky  No vain HighPriest with surly grandeur trod  As if to shame the meanness of his God  When like the Titans earth's rebellious crew  To Heaven's high bulwarks rais'd their hostile view  In vain their boastful arrogance to quell  Their leaders were dispers'd their turret fell  On Shinar's plains Despotic Power unfurl'd  Her banner and to vex the groaning world  From shore to shore the strange contagion ran  Fraternal concord ceas'd and Monarchy began  Thus while the storms in hollow caverns sleep  And scarce a zephyr fans the quiet deep  Suddenly from the rock's impending brow  A cumbrous fragment on the tide below  Comes rushing downwards boils the vast profound  Waves upon waves dash'd on the beach resound  Detested Hunter Nimrod led the way  War was his savage pastime man his prey  For brutal strength by trembling vassals fear'd  The walls of ancient Babylon he rear'd  In his high dome with crayons rude portray'd  The warrior's dread atchievements were display'd  Here pierc'd with darts th' expiring tyger lay  There rush'd embattled hosts in firm array  There in his car the thickest ranks he broke  And nations yielded to his galling yoke  Such empire's originwith horrid yell  From the black confines of his native hell  Emerg'd the Demon of tyrannic pride  And Vice came onward with a larger stride  Ungrateful were the task and endless toil  To trace its progress thro' each distant soil  Fertile of Tyrants Craft with Prowess join'd  Soon tam'd the generous fierceness of mankind  Dominion first was gain'd by lawless might  The claim of long Hereditary Right  Succeeded when to varnish o'er each flaw  And bow the world with superstitious awe  The Priests dress'd up some bugbear of their own  Call'd him a King and plac'd him on a throne  Then caught the weakness of those darker times  And dragg'd in Heaven to sanctify his crimes  Search well its inmost source and tell whence springs  This sacred claim of Israel's vaunted Kings  When that audacious crew renounc'd their God  Despis'd his mercies brav'd his heaviest rod  And for his Patronage too mighty grown  Set up a little Idol of their own  Say did their Prophet urge Saul's Right Divine  His incense blaz'd not at so vile a shrine  Or did some ill in mystic leaves foretold  And chronicled by gravest seers of old  While on delusive hopes they fondly built  O'erwhelm them with involuntary guilt  No 'twas their baffled pride whose last resource  Dragg'd this perdition on their heads by sorce  From that black period each intenser crime  That brands with infamy its parent clime  Assail'd the palace overspread the land  And in their temple took its guilty stand  The seat of Chemosh by the purple vine  Was planted and at Moloch's brazen shrine  As with inhuman zeal the trembling sire  Consign'd his shrieking infants to the fire  While with loud din their hideous cymbals rung  His Worshippers obscene their uncouth orgies sung  Belief in various senses understood  Is man's severest curse or surest good  Thus in the meads where hallow'd Jordan glides  Enriching Palestine with copious tides  Where springs the branching palm where streams the oil  Where fruitful vineyards bless the peasant's toil  Deep in the heart of Siddim's odious vale  Impregnating with death each tainted gale  The black Asphaltes from its slimy bed  Sees pitchy clouds sulphureous vapours spread  Let Mecca tell big with aspiring schemes  Seraphic trances counterfeited dreams  How subtle Mahomet of servile birth  Diffus'd his tenets thro' th' astonish'd earth  By fire and sword the Nations undeceiv'd  Confess'd their former errors and believ'd  In Judah's soil the tree of knowledge grew  Whose fruit unsound yet specious to the view  Entrusted to the treacherous Levite's care  Fell ere it ripen'd in that baleful air  Relentless Cowards with a brutal hand  Urging their fraudful progress thro' the land  O'er Nature's parting agonies they trod  And slaughter'd millions in the name of God  Each right of arms infringing nor forbore  To dip their reeking blades in infant gore  Till mighty conscience whose prevailing call  Opes the dread volume of her laws to all  Bewail'd them darken'd by so strong a taint  That none discern'd the villain from the saint  Far other fame the Christian doctrine gain'd  From Heaven transmitted and by Heaven maintain'd  With scepter'd arrogance to vex the earth  Yet most those realms which gave his grandeur birth  To make divided Faith and Virtue foes  On its firm base no second David rose  Yet from this pure and unpolluted source  Ere long the streams in a perverted course  Ran foul Fanatics soon began to call  Merit a sound Religion all in all  Infuriate Priests the bonds of nature tore  And Persecution drench'd the world with gore  Arm'd with the Cross o'er Asia's ravag'd lands  See sainted Champions pour their desperate bands  A dreaming Hermit leads them and aloud  Preaches salvation to the frantic crowd  Zeal whets the poniard and with ruthless joy  They come they sack they ravish they destroy  The Muse rejecting this historic draught  With bitter truths strict testimonies fraught  Its civil discords and religious strife  O'erlooks to take a fairer view of life  Borne on the rapid wings of Thought she flies  Opes new creations seeks for other skies  Revolving all that sportive Ovid told  Of cloudless suns of ages wing'd with gold  Those ages when in Peneus' chearful grove  Man knew no sorrows no disease but Love  When Nature's self was unconstrain'd and young  And Bards rang'd lawless as the Gods they sung  Ye happier times of innocence and truth  Pleasing instructors of my thoughtless youth  When none the image of his God belied  No Minions crouch'd beneath a Sultan's pride  No wealth ensnar'd no poverty distress'd  No ruffians plunder'd and no kings oppress'd  Tho' doom'd to grovel in a baser age  Will I from Memory's enchanting page  Retrace your scatter'd annalsWhen of old  Arcadia's peaceful shepherds uncontroul'd  Their ranging flocks thro' boundless pastures drove  Or tun'd their pipes beneath the myrtle grove  Their laws on brazen tablets unimprest  Were deeply grav'd on each ingenuous breast  No proud Vicegerent of Astrea reign'd  Astrea's self her own decrees maintain'd  Books useless lumber yet in embryo slept  No Damon rav'd in rhime no Delia wept  Nor had nor needed they the casuist's page  Plain were the duties of that simpler age  For Nature best of mothers pleas'd to teach  Virtues no modern theorist can reach  With characters indelible on high  Blazon'd her system of Equality  Alas how gladly would Illusion's beam  For ever vibrate on this glittering theme  Here let me finish nor my soul to wring  From Fable's sweets proceed to Fable's sting  I mustthese fairy dreams have had their space  And now the dreadful sequel claims a place  Like the presumptuous Mariner whose sails  Wasted from port with soft Etesian gales  Urge his o'erweening eagerness to brave  Without a Pilot the persidious wave  Soon o'er whose bark th' impetuous tempests sweep  And bury all his fortunes in the deep  Seduc'd by Fancy's charms amidst a grove  Of pleasing errors have I dar'd to rove  Till half desponding comfortless aghast  I but survey bright Freedom's form at last  To see her perish by as sure a wound  Mid these enchantments as on vulgar ground  Fond Epimetheus when thy luckless hand  Scatter'd Pandora's curses o'er the land  Forth from the casket glittering to the view  Scepters and crowns delusive trumpery flew  Man ey'd the bait and with an ideot joy  Eagerly rush'd to snatch the gilded toy  Freedom thenceforth and Peace and Justice fled  Infernal Discord rear'd her snaky head  From blackest Erebus whose scorpions hurl'd  By dread Oppression curb'd a wretched world  Too late remorse congeal'd each guilty soul  And forky lightnings flash'd from pole to pole  Wheree'er we search the vast instructive page  Of Fact or Fiction we in every age  See Saints impal'd and tortur'd at the stake  Thro' fervent zeal and for Religion's sake  Murders and sorceries and Men whose heart  Ne'er prompted one humane one generous part  While some vain Mortal arbiter os ill  Govern'd the rest at whose imperious will  Millions of slaughter'd Heroes bit the dust  To soothe a Tyrant's pride a Strumpet's lust  Till loathing both the present and the past  We learn this melancholy truth at last  " On Life's rough sea by stormy passions tost  " Freedom and Virtue were together lost"  Shame on our vaunted reason when we find  No creature else so senseless and so blind  The Brutes indeed to force superior yield  And leave the strongest master of the field  Yet this imperial claim to none descends  With the possessor's strength his title ends  Nor if their enterprizing Leader calls  Do they forsake their wellreplenish'd stalls  And with heroic frenzy risk their life  Fomenting some unnecessary strife  Unfall'n and uncorrupted they fulfil  Their Nature's end their mighty Maker's will  Stoop then ye sons of Reason stoop and own  The veriest beast more worthy of a throne  The Chain whose two Extremities unite  Presenting still a middle to our sight  Where link by link in fruitless search we tend  Yet find not a beginning or an end  Talk as we please dissemble how we can  Presents a just similitude of Man  Who in each state of life constrain'd to own  A strict dependance useless when alone  Cleaves tho' a Monarch to his native dung  And venerates the soil from whence he sprung  View first the Slave whom his unhappy fate  In galling fetters to some foreign state  Tears from his dearest home there basely sold  By those who truck humanity for gold  Abus'd neglected sinking with distress  When all is dark and Hope alone can bless  Ev'n then thro' Life's dim curtain he descries  Some happier regions and serener skies  Where Commerce never rears her impious head  No Fiends approach no Missionaries tread  Next him the Peasant whose incessant toil  Harsly requited tills the rugged soil  Press'd by the barbarous insults of the great  The foolish prodigality of state  Yet his low couch no thorny cares molest  His even spirits yield unbroken rest  Those restless Beings next in order place  Whose motley stations wear a doubtful face  Who dragg'd by Fortune into Middle Life  That vortex of malevolence and strife  Envying the great and scossing at the mean  Or swol'n with pride or wasted with chagrin  Like Mahomet's unsettled ashes dwell  Midway suspended between Heaven and Hell  Clad with those Titles antient Justice gave  To grace the wise the generous and the brave  O'er these ascend the Sycophants of Power  Their master's tools the minions of an hour  Last of the Group to close this irksome scene  Childishly great and eminently mean  Behold the Monarch whose exalted throne  Dupes to their fear his Eastern Vassals own  When by the toil which earns the Hind's hard bread  His splendor is maintain'd his lux'ry fed  Is not a wretch like this to either side  Of Life's perverse extremities allied  Here to its source the line revolving tends  Here close the points and here the circle ends  When lust when rapine when ungovern'd rage  Strongly characteris'd the iron age  Law soon became a necessary ill  Vice edg'd the sword and gave it force to kill  Monarchs we see were then at first design'd  A general good a blessing unconfin'd  For public welfare not for private ends  From sire to son the regal crown descends  When Kings support afflicted Virtue's cause  Curb potent Vice and vindicate the laws  Our high respect deservedly they share  Not for themselves but for the trust they bear  As on the slippery pinnacle they stand  Of brittle grandeur with rapacious hand  If they assume unlimited domain  And madly govern with perverted rein  The vast Machine of Empire to the skies  Ascend the widow's tears the orphan's cries  A Cato's spirit or a Cicero's tongue  With keen resentment animates the throng  Some Hampden hears his gasping country's groan  And in just vengeance shakes a guilty throne  Should inauspicious Fortune tear away  From Virtue's grasp the triumphs of a day  Should Tyranny by long success grown great  Crush the defenceless victims of her hate  Grim Superstition with an haggard eye  Points to the spoils and rears her torch on high  From regal conquest her own inference draws  And blends with that of Heaven its dearer cause  Blind to the treacherous snare when Fate decreed  That Troy should perish by the wooden steed  The rest stood fix'd with hesitating fear  While bold Laocoon hurl'd his forcesul spear  Against the monster from whose knotty side  Resounding arms and Grecian shrieks replied  Stung by a snake the pious Priest expir'd  While Folly gaz'd and Ignorance

prayer his closing life  Can we unmov'd with indignation bear  To see grave Clarendon whose stile whose air  'Twixt tortur'd facts and scripturephrases quaint  Shews half the royalist and half the saint  Stamp on his ashes with a dotard's pride  And execrate the cause for which he died  Ye fields of Naseby where the thundering hand  Of Freedom greatly prosper'd where that band  Of hardy Patriots resolutely bore  Thro' storms of horror and thro' seas of gore  Their country's charter snatch'd in happiest hour  From Sacerdotal wrath and Kingly power  Oft as your towers on which dread Vengeance wrote  Strong characters and blasted where she smote  In youth's gay season fix'd my roving eye  How did I hail that scene of victory  Ev'n now methinks I see brave Fairfax tread  Th'

precincts of Ambition's throne  To crown some proud Infringer of the laws  But due to vengeance due to Britain's cause  Nor tho' the Muse forlorn and helpless stray  O'er thy bare coast nor glean one fragrant bay  Bleak Caledonia shalt thou pass unsung  For Freedom on thy hills her arm newstrung  When thy firm sons who lov'd the public weal  Or inly burn'd to see tyrannic Zeal  Against their altars lift an impious hand  And threat th' accustom'd worship of the land  From their huge cliffs descending like a flood  Stood forth prepar'd to seal their faith with blood  At their approach while perjur'd Holland fled  False to his Master's cause his Master's bed  And Hierarchy that fiend whom Scripture paints  Drunk with the blood of Martyrs and of Sai n ts  Consign'd by Fate in penal chains

plain  Darkness extends her ebon ray  While wide along the gloomy scene  Deep Silence holds her solemn sway  Throughout the earth no chearful beam  The melancholic eye surveys  Save where the worm's fantastic gleam  The 'nighted traveller betrays  The savage race so Heaven decrees  No longer thro' the forest rove  All nature rests and not a breeze  Disturbs the stillness of the grove  All nature rests in Sleep's soft arms  The village swain forgets his care  Sleep that the sting of Sorrow charms  And heals all sadness but Despair  Despair alone her power denies  And when the sun withdraws his rays  To the wild beach distracted flies  Or chearless thro' the desart strays  Or to the churchyard's horrors led  While fearful echoes burst around  On some cold stone he leans his head  Or throws his body on the ground  To some such drear and solemn scene  Some friendly power direct my way  Where pale Misfortune's haggard train  Sad luxury delight to stray  Wrapp'd in the solitary gloom  Retir'd from life's fantastic crew  Resign'd I'll wait my final doom  And bid the busy world adieu  The world has now no joy for me  Nor can life now one pleasure boast  Since all my eyes desir'd to see  My wish my hope my all is lost  Since she so form'd to please and bless  So wise so innocent so fair  Whose converse sweet made sorrow less  And brighten'd all the gloom of care  Since she is

began  The glittering prospect charm'd my eyes  I saw along th' extended plan  Joy after joy successive rise  And Fame her golden trumpet blew  And Power display'd her gorgeous charms  And Wealth engag'd my wandering view  And Pleasure woo'd me to her arms  To each by turns my vows I paid  As Folly led me to admire  While Fancy magnified each shade  And Hope increas'd each fond desire  But soon I found 'twas all a dream  And learn'd the fond pursuit to shun  Where few can reach their purpos'd aim  And thousands daily are undone  And Fame I found was empty air  And Wealth had Terror for her guest  And Pleasure's path was strewn with care  And Power was vanity at best  Tir'd of the chace I gave it o'er  And in a far sequester'd shade  To Contemplation's sober power  My youth's next services I paid  There Health and Peace adorn'd the scene  And oft indulgent to my prayer  With mirthful eye and frolic mien  The Muse would deign to visit there  There would she oft delighted rove  The slowerenamell'd vale along  Or wander with me thro' the grove  And listen to the woodlark's song  Or 'mid the forest's awful gloom  Whilst wild amazement fill'd my eyes  Recal past ages from the tomb  And bid ideal worlds arise  Thus in the Muse's favour blest  One wish alone my soul could frame  And Heaven bestow'd to crown the rest  A friend and Thyrsis was his name  For manly constancy and truth  And worth unconscious of a stain  He bloom'd the flower of Britain's youth  The boast and wonder of the plain  Still with our years our friendship grew  No cares did then my peace destroy  Time brought new blessings as he flew  And every hour was wing'd with joy  But soon the blissful scene was lost  Soon did the sad reverse appear  Love came like an untimely frost  To blast the promise of my year  I saw young Daphne's angelform  Fool that I was I bless'd the smart  And while I gaz'd nor thought of harm  The dear infection seiz'd my heart  She wasat least in Damon's eyes  Made up of loveliness and grace  Her heart a stranger to disguise  Her mind as perfect as her face  To hear her speak to see her move  Unhappy I alas the while  Her voice was joy her look was love  And Heaven was open'd in her smile  She heard me breathe my amorous prayers  She listen'd to the tender strain  She heard my sighs she saw my tears  And seem'd at length to share my pain  She said she lov'dand I poor youth  How soon alas can Hope persuade  Thought all she said no more than truth  And all my love was well repaid  In joys unknown to courts or kings  With her I sate the livelong day  And said and look'd such tender things  As none beside could look or say  How soon can Fortune shift the scene  And all our earthly bliss destroy  Care hovers round and Grief's fell train  Still treads upon the heels of Joy  My age's hope my youth's best boast  My soul's chief blessing and my pride  In one sad moment all were lost  And Daphne chang'd and Thyrsis died  O who that heard her vows erewhile  Could dream these vows were insincere  Or who could think that saw her smile  That fraud could find admittance there  Yet she was falsemy heart will break  Her frauds her perjuries were such  Some other tongue than mine must speak  I have not power to say how much  Ye swains hence warn'd avoid the bait  O shun her paths the traitress shun  Her voice is death her smile is fate  Who hears or sees her is undone  And when Death's hand shall close my eye  For soon I know the day will come  O chear my spirit with a sigh  And grave these lines upon my tomb  THE EPITAPH  Consign'd to dust beneath this stone  In manhood's prime is Damon laid  Joyless he liv'd and dy'd unknown  In bleak misfortune's barren shade  Lov'd by the Muse but lov'd in vain  'Twas beauty drew his ruin on  He saw young Daphne on the plain  He lov'd believ'd and was undone  His heart then sunk beneath the storm  Sad meed of unexampled truth  And sorrow like an cnvious worm  Devour'd the blossom of his youth  Beneath this stone the youth is laid  O greet his ashes with a tear  May Heaven with blessings crown his shade  And grant that peace he wanted here  AN INSCRIPTION WRITTEN UPON ONE OF THE  Two seats in Hamwalks called Tubs from their form which resembles an hogshead split in two  TUBS IN HAMWALKS SEPTEMBER  BY THE SAME  DARK was the sky with many a cloud  The fearful lightnings flash'd around  Low to the blast the forest bow'd  And bellowing thunders rock'd the ground  Fast fell the rains upon my head  And weak and weary were my feet  When lo this hospitable shed  At length supply'd a kind retreat  That in fair memory's faithful page  The bard's escape may flourish long  Yet shuddering from the tempest's rage  He dedicates the votive song  For ever sacred be the earth  From whence the tree its vigour drew  The hour that gave the seedling birth  The forest where the scyon grew  Long honour'd may his ashes rest  Who first the tender shoot did rear  Blest be his nameBut doubly blest  The friendly hand that plac'd it here  O ne'er may war or wind or wave  This pleasurable scene deform  But time still spare the seat which gave  The poet shelter from the storm  VERSES WRITTEN UPON A PEDESTAL BENEATH A ROW OF ELMS IN A MEADOW NEAR RICHMOND FERRY BELONGING TO RICHARD OWEN CAMBRIDGE ESQ SEPTEMBER  BY THE SAME  The first line of this little piece is borrowed from an Ode of Mr Mason's published in Dodsley's Miscellanies  YE greenhair'd Nymphs whom Pan allows  To guard from harm these favour'd boughs  Ye blueey'd Naiads of the stream  That soothe the warm poetic dream  Ye elves and sprights that thronging round  When midnight darkens all the ground  In antic measures uncontroul'd  Your fairy sports and revels hold  And up and down wheree'er ye pass  With many a ringlet print the grass  If e'er the bard hath hail'd your power  At morn's grey dawn or evening hour  If e'er by moonlight on the plain  Your ears have caught th' enraptur'd strain  From every flow'ret's velvet head  From reverend Thames's oozy bed  From these moss'd elms where prison'd deep  Conceal'd from human eyes ye sleep  If these your haunts be worth your care  Awake arise and hear my prayer  O banish from this peaceful plain  The perjur'd nymph the faithless swain  The stubborn heart that scorns to bow  And harsh rejects the honest vow  The fop who wounds the virgin's ear  With aught that sense would blush to hear  Or false to honour mean and vain  Defames the worth he cannot stain  The light conquet with various art  Who casts her net for every heart  And smiling slatters to the chace  Alike the worthy and the base  The dame who proud of virtue's praise  Is happy if a sister strays  And conscious of unclouded fame  Delighted spreads the tale of shame  But far O banish'd far be they  Who hear unmov'd the orphan's cry  Who see nor wish to wipe away  The tear that swells the widow's eye  The unloving man whose narrow mind  Disdains to feel for humankind  At others' bliss whose cheek ne'er glows  Whose breast ne'er throbs with others' woes  Whose hoarded sum of private joys  His private care alone destroys  Ye fairies cast your spells around  And guard from such this hallow'd ground  But welcome all who sigh with truth  Each constant maid and faithful youth  Whom mutual love alone hath join'd  Sweet union of the willing mind  Hearts pair'd in Heaven not meanly sold  Lawlicens'd prostitutes for gold  And welcome thrice and thrice again  The chosen few the worthy train  Whose steady feet untaught to stray  Still tread where virtue marks the way  Whose souls no thought whose hands have known  No deed which honour might not own  Who torn with pain or stung with care  In others' bliss can claim a part  And in life's brightest hour can share  Each pang that wrings another's heart  Ye guardian spirits when such ye see  Sweet peace be theirs and welcome free  Clear be the sky from clouds or showers  Green be the turf and fresh the flowers  And that the youth whose pious care  Lays on your shrine this honest prayer  May with the rest admittance gain  And visit oft this pleasant scene  Let all who love the Muse attend  Who loves the Muse is Virtue's friend  Such then alone may venture here  Who free from guilt are free from fear  Whose wide affections can embrace  The whole extent of human race  Whom Virtue and her friends approve  Whom Cambridge and the Muses love  THE RECANTATION AN ODE  BY  BY Love too long depriv'd of rest  Fell tyrant of the human breast  His vassal long and worn with pain  Indignant late I spurn'd the chain  In verse in prose I sung and swore  No charms should e'er enslave me more  Nor neck nor hair nor lip nor eye  Again should force one tender sigh  As taught by Heaven's informing power  From every fruit and every flower  That nature opens to the view  The bee extracts the nectardew  A vagrant thus and free to change  From fair to fair I vow'd to range  And part from each without regret  As pleas'd and happy as I met  Then Freedom's praise inspir'd my tongue  With Freedom's praise the vallies rung  And every night and every day  My heart thus pour'd th' enraptur'd lay  " My cares are gone my sorrows cease  " My breast regains its wonted peace  " And joy and hope returning prove  " That Reason is too strong for Love"  Such was my boastbut ah how vain  How short was Reason's vaunted reign  The firm resolve I form'd erewhile  How weak oppos'd to Clara's smile  Chang'd is the strainThe vallies round  With Freedom's praise no more refound  But every night and every day  My full heart pour'd the alter'd lay  Offended deity whose power  My rebel tongue but now forswore  Accept my penitence sincere  My crime forgive and grant my prayer  Let not thy slave condemn'd to mourn  With unrequited passion burn  With Love's soft thoughts her breast inspire  And kindle there an equal fire  It is not beauty's gaudy flower  The empty triumph of an hour  Nor practis'd wiles of female art  That now subdue my destin'd heart  O no'Tis Heaven whose wondrous hand  A transcript of itself hath plann'd  And to each outward grace hath join'd  Each lovelier feature of the mind  These charms shall last when others fly  When roses fade and lilies die  When that dear eye's declining beam  Its living fire no more shall stream  Blest then and happy in my chain  The fong of Freedom flows in vain  Nor Reason's harsh reproof I fear  For Reason's self is Passion here  O dearer far than wealth or fame  My daily thought my nightly dream  If yet no youth's successful art  Sweet Hope hath touch'd thy gentle heart  If yet no swain hath blest thy choice  Indulgent hear thy Damon's voice  From doubts from fears his bosom free  And bid him livefor Love and Thee  ODE TO HORROR  IN THE ALLEGORIC DESCRIPTIVE ALLITERATIVE

Druiddreams dissolv'd and dead  VERSES ON THE EXPECTED ARRIVAL OF QUEEN CHARLOTTE IN AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND  BY  YESevery hopeful son of rhyme  Will surely seize this happy time  Vault upon Pegasus's back  Now grown an academic hack  And sing the beauties of a Queen  Whom by the by he has not seen  Will swear her eyes are black as jet  Her teeth in pearls as coral set  Will tell us that the rose has lent  Her cheek its bloom her lips its scent  That Philomel breaks off her song  And listens to her sweeter tongue  That Venus and the Graces join'd  To form this Phoenix of her kind  And Pallas undertook to store  Her mind with Wisdom's chiefest lore  Thus form'd Jove issues a decree  That George's consort she shall be  Then Cupid for what match is made  By poets without Cupid's aid  Picks out the swiftest of his darts  And pierces instant both their hearts  Your fearful Prosemen here might doubt  How best to bring this match about  For winds and waves are illbred things  And little care for Queens and Kings  But as the Gods assembled stand  And wait each youthful bard's command  All fancy'd dangers they deride  Of boisterous winds and swelling tide  Neptune is call'd to wait upon her  And seanymphs are her maids of honour  Whilst we instead of eastern gales  With vows and praises fill the sails  And when with due poetic care  They safely land the Royal Fair  They catch the happy simile  Of Venus rising from the sea  Soon as she moves the hill and vale  Responsive tell the joyful tale  And wonder holds th' enraptur'd throng  To see the Goddess pass along  The bowing forests all adore her  And flowers spontaneous spring before her  Where you and I all day might travel  And meet with nought but sand and gravel  But poets have a piercing eye  And many pretty things can spy  Which neither you nor I can see  But then the fault's in you and me  The King astonish'd must appear  And find that Fame has wrong'd his dear  Then Hymen like a bishop stands  To join the lovers' plighted hands  Apollo and the Muses wait  The nuptial song to celebrate  But I who rarely spend my time  In paying court or spinning rhyme  Who cannot from the high abodes  Call down at will a troop of Gods  Must in the plain prosaic way  The wishes of my soul convey  May Heaven our Monarch's choice approve  May he be blest with mutual love  And be as happy with his Queen  As with my Chloe I have been  When wandering thro' the beechen grove  She sweetly smil'd and talk'd of love  And O that he may live to see  A son as wise and good as he  And may his consort grace the throne  With virtues equal to his own  Our courtly bards will needs be telling  That she's like Venus or like Helen  I wish that she may prove as fair  As Egremont and Pembroke are  For tho' by sages 'tis confest  That beauty's but a toy at best  Yet 'tis methinks in married life  A pretty douceur with a wife  And may the minutes as they fly  Strengthen still the nuptial tye  While hand in hand thro' life they go  Till love shall into friendship grow  For tho' these blessings rarely wait  On regal pomp and tinsel'd state  Yet happiness is virtue's lot  Alike in palace and in cot  'Tis true the grave affairs of state  With little folks have little weight  Yet I confess my patriot heart  In Britain's welfare bears its part  With transport glows at George's name  And triumphs in its country's fame  With hourly pleasure I can sit  And talk of Granby Hawke and Pitt  And whilst I praise the good and brave  Disdain the coward and the knave  At growth of taxes others fret  And shudder at the nation's debt  I ne'er the fancied ills bemoan  No debts disturb me but my own  What tho' our coffers sink our trade  Repairs the breach which war has made  And if expences now run high  Our minds must with our means comply  Thus far my politics extend  And here my warmest wishes end  May Merit flourish Faction cease  And I and Europe live in Peace  AMINTA AN ELEGY  BY MR GERRARD  AN o'ergrown wood my wandering steps invade  With surface mantled in untrodden snow  Dire haunt for none but savage monsters made  Where frosts descend and howling tempests blow  Here from the search of busy mortals stray'd  My woeworn soul shall hug her galling chain  For sure no forest boasts too deep a shade  No haunt too wild for misery to remain  O my Aminta dear distracting name  Late all my comfort all my fond delight  Still writhes my soul beneath its torturing flame  Still thy pale image fills my aching sight  When shall vain memory slumber o'er her woes  When to oblivion be her tale resign'd  When shall this fatal form in death repose  Like thine fair victim to the dust consign'd  Again the accents faulter on my tongue  Again to tear the conscious tear succeeds  From sharp reflection is the dagger sprung  And Nature wounded to the center bleeds  Ye bitter skies upon the tale descend  Ye blasts tho' rude your visits lend an ear  Around ye gentler oaks your branches bend  And as ye listen drop an icy tear  'Twas when the step with conscious pleasure roves  Where round the shades the circling woodbines throng  When Flora wantons o'er th' enamell'd groves  And feather'd choirs indulge the amorous song  Inspir'd by duteous love I fondly stray'd  Two milkwhite doves officious to ensnare  Beneath a silent thicket as they play'd  A grateful present for my softer fair  But ah in smiles no more they met my sight  Their ruffled heads lay gasping on the ground  Where my dire emblem a rapacious Kite  Tore their soft limbs and strew'd their plumes around  The tear of pity stole into my eye  While ruder passions in their turn succeed  Forbid the victims unreveng'd to die  And doom the author of their wrongs to bleed  With hasty step enrag'd I homewards ran  Curse on my speed th' unerring tube I brought  That fatal hour my date of woe began  Too sharp to telltoo horrible for thought  Disastrous deedirrevocable ill  How shall I tell the anguish of my Fate  Teach me remorseless monsters not to feel  Instruct me fiends and furies to relate  Wrathful behind the guilty shade I stole  I rais'd the tubethe clamorous woods resound  Too late I saw the idol of my soul  Struck by my aim fall shrieking to the ground  No other bliss her soul allow'd but me  Hapless the pair that thus indulgent prove  She sought concealment from a shady tree  In amorous silence to observe her love  I ranbut O too soon I found it true  From her stain'd breast life's crimson stream'd apace  From her wan eyes the sparkling lustres flew  The shortliv'd roses faded from her face  Godscould I bear that fond reproachful look  That strove her peerless innocence to plead  But partial death awhile her tongue forsook  To save a wretch that doom'd himself to bleed  While I distracted press'd her in my arms  And fondly strove t' imbibe her latest breath  " O spare rash love she cry'd thy fatal charms  " Nor seek cold shelter in the arms of death  " Content beneath thy erring hand I die  " Our fates grew envious of a bliss so true  " Then urge not thy distress when low I lie  " But in this breath receive my last adieu"  No more she spake but droop'd her lily head  In death she sicken'dbreathlesshaggardpale  While all my inmost soul with horror bled  And ask'd kind vengeance from the passing gale  Where slept your bolts ye lingering lightnings say  Why riv'd ye not this selfcondemned breast  Or why too passive earth didst thou delay  To stretch thy jaws and crush me into rest  Low in the dust the beauteous corse I plac'd  Bedew'd and soft with many a falling tear  With sable yew the rising turf I grac'd  And bade the cypress mourn in silence near  Oft as bright morn's allsearching eye returns  Full to my view the fatal spot is brought  Thro' sleepless night my haunted spirit mourns  No gloom can hide me from distracting thought  When spotless victim shall my form decay  This guilty load say when shall I resign  When shall my spirit wing her chearless way  And my cold corse lie treasur'd up with thine  PETHERTONBRIDGE AN ELEGY  Tradition holds that the catastrophe alluded to in this elegy happened about two centuries ago of which the sculpture is yet to be seen at the abovementioned bridge near SouthPetherton Somerset  INSCRIBED TO THE REV MR BEAN OF STOKESUBHAMDON SOMERSET  BY THE SAME  O Bean whose fond connubial days  A beauteous infantrace attend  Say wilt thou once more aid my lays  And join the patron to the friend  But not o'er bright Aonian plains  Enraptur'd as we us'd to roam  The Muse each joyous thought restrains  And calls her wing'd ideas home  The wedded pair for children pray  They comefair blessings from the skies  What raptures gild the haleyon day  What joys in distant azure rise  But ah enamour'd as they view  The smiling hopeful infanttrain  Unseen misfortune marks his due  Unheard he threats the heart with pain  Had sad disaster ne'er ensnar'd  The soft the innocent and young  The tender Muse had gladly spar'd  The little heroes of her song  See'st thou the limpid current glide  Beneath yon bridge my hapless theme  Where brambles fringe its verdant side  And willows tremble o'er the stream  From Petherton it takes its name  From whence two smiling infants stray'd  Led by the stream they hither came  And on the flowery margin play'd  Sweet victims must your shortliv'd day  So soon extinguish in the wave  And point the setting sun his way  That glimmer'd o'er your watry grave  As each by childish fancy led  Cropt the broad daisies as they sprung  Lay stretch'd along the verdant bed  And sweetly ply'd the lisping tongue  Lo from the spraydeserted steep  Where either way the twigs divide  The one roll'd headlong to the deep  And plung'd beneath the closing tide  The other saw and from the land  While nature imag'd strange distress  Stretch'd o'er the brink his little hand  The fruitless signal of redress  The offer'd pledge without delay  The struggling victim rose and caught  But ah in vaintheir fatal way  They both descended swift as thought  Short was the waveoppressing space  Convuls'd with pains too sharp to bear  Their lives dissolv'd in one embrace  Their mingled souls flew up in air  Lo there yon timeworn sculpture shews  The sad the melancholy truth  What pangs the tortur'd parent knows  What snares await defenceless youth  Here not to sympathy unknown  Full oft the sad Muse wandering near  Bends silent o'er the mossy stone  And wets it with a willing tear  AN EPISTLE FROM AN UNFORTUNATE GENTLEMAN TO A YOUNG LADY  Occasioned by a catastrophe well known in the West    BY THE SAME  THESE the last lines my trembling hands can write  These words the last my dying lips recite  Read and repent that your unkindness gave  A wretched lover an untimely grave  Sunk by despair from life's enchanting view  Lost ever lost to happiness and you  No more these eyelids shower incessant tears  No more my spirit sinks with boding fears  No more your frowns my suing passion meet  No more I fall submissive at your feet  With fruitless love this heart shall cease to burn  Life's empty dream shall nevermore return  Think not that labouring to subdue your hate  My artful soul forebodes a fancied fate  For e'er yon sun descends his western way  Cold shall I lie a lifeless lump of clay  Tir'd of my long encounters with disdain  Peaceful my pulse and ebbing from its pain  Each vital movement sinking to decay  And my spent soul just languishing away  E'er my last breath yet hovers to depart  I prompt my hand to pour out all my heart  The hand oft rais'd compassion to implore  The heart that burns with slighted fires no more  Relentless nymph of nature's fairest frame  Unpitying soul and woman but in name  Angelic bloom the coldest heart to win  Without allurement but disdain within  Regard the sounds which seal my parting breath  E'er the vain murmurs shall be hush'd in death  Let pity view what love disdain'd to save  And mourn a wretch sent headlong to the grave  Profuse of all an anxious lover's care  To urge his suit and win the listening fair  Try'd every purpose to relieve my woe  My soul chides not for innocent I go  Save when soft pity bids my gentler mind  Shrink at your fate and drop a tear behind  How oft and fruitless have I strove to move  Unfeeling beauty with the pangs of love  As rose your breast with captivating grace  And heighten'd charms flew blushing to your face  Insulting charms that gave a fiercer wound  Fond as I lay and prostrate on the ground  Heavens with what scorn you strove my suit to meet  Frown'd with your eyes and spurn'd me with your feet  To bleeding love such hard returns you gave  As barbarous rocks that dash the pressing wave  O could your looks have turn'd my hapless fate  And frown'd my shortliv'd passion into hate  Then had no scattering breeze my sorrows known  Nor vale responsive had prolong'd the moan  Then had those lips ne'er learnt their woeful tale  Nor death yet cloath'd them in eternal pale  Oft to the woods in frantic rage I slew  To cool my bosom with the falling dew  Oft in sad accents sigh'd each prompting ill  And taught wild oaks to pity and to feel  Till with despair my heart rekindled burns  And all the anguish of my soul returns  Then restless to the fragrant meads I hie  Death in my face distraction in my eye  There as reclin'd along the verdant plain  My grief renews her heartwrung strains again  Lo pitying Phoebus sinks with sorrow pale  And mournful night descends upon the tale  When tir'd at length my wrongs no more complain  And sighs are stifled in obtuser pain  When the deep fountains of my eyes are spent  And fiercer anguish sinks to discontent  Slow I return and prostrate on my bed  Bid the soft pillow lull my heavy head  But O when downy sleep its court renews  And shades the soul with visionary views  Illusive dreams to fan my slumbering fire  And wake the fever of intense desire  Present your softer image to my sight  All warm with smiles and glowing with delight  Gods with what bliss I view thy darling charms  And strive to clasp thee melting in my arms  But ah the shade my empty grasp deceives  And as it flits and my fond soul bereaves  The transient slumbers slip their airy chain  And give me back to all my woes again  There wrapt in floods of grief I sigh forlorn  The constant greetings of unwelcome morn  But should oblivion reassume her sway  And slumbers once more steal my woes away  When the short flights of fancy intervene  Your muchlov'd image fills out every scene  But now no more soft smiles your face adorn  Lo o'er each feature broods destructive scorn  Suppliant in tears I urge my suit again  Sullen you stand and view me with disdain  Your ears exclude the story of my smart  Your baleful eyes dart anguish to my heart  I wakeglad nature hails returning day  And the wild songsters chaunt their mattinlay  The sun in glory mounts the crystal sky  And all creation is in smiles but I  Then sink in death my sensesfor in vain  You strive to quench the phrenzy of your pain  Break break fond hearther hate thou can'st not tame  Then take this certain triumph o'er thy flame  'Tis donethe dread of future wrongs is past  Lo brittle passion verges to its last  'Tis donevain life's illusive scenes are o'er  Disdainful beauty shakes her chains no more  Come peaceful gloom expand thy downy breast  And soothe O soothe me to eternal rest  There hush my plaints and gently lull my woes  Where one still stream of dull oblivion flows  No labouring breast there heaves with torture's throws  No heart consumes her daily hoard of woes  No dreams of former pain the soul invade  Calmly she sleeps a sad unthinking shade  But e'er from thought my struggling soul is free  One latest tear she dedicates to thee  She views thee on the brink of vain despair  Beat thy big breast and rend thy flowing hair  Feels torturing love her sable deluge roll  Weigh down thy senses and o'erbear thy soul  In vain your heart relents in vain you weep  No lover wakes from his eternal sleep  Alas I see thy frantic spirit rave  And thy last breath expiring on my grave  Is this the fortune of those highpriz'd charms  Ah spare them for some worthier lover's arms  And may these bodings ne'er with truth agree  May grief and anguish be unknown to thee  May bitter memory ne'er recount with pain  That e'er you frown'd or I admir'd in vain  No moremy spirit is prepar'd to fly  Supprest my voice and stiffen'd is my eye  Death's swimming shadows intercept my view  Vain world and thou relentless nymph adieu  A SONG  BY THE SAME  YE scenes that engag'd my gay youth  Say whither so fast do ye fly  If the lesson you told me was truth  Ah why do ye fade from my eye  That meadow where often I stray'd  That bank and yon shadowy tree  Those streams with such fondness survey'd  Have hid all their sweetness from me  Yon hill that uprears his smooth head  Where the wildthyme its fragrance bestows  Whose verdures have rose from my bed  And whose breezes have sigh'd my repose  What tho' from his summit so high  Flock cottage and woodland are seen  Yet no more I with fondness descry  For indifference rises between  Ah whither ye sweets do ye fly  For fancy your absence must mourn  Ah say will ye fade from my eye  And yet will ye never return  That valley whose mantle so gay  Is with primrose and cowslip o'erspread  No longer invites me to stray  And rifle the sweets of their bed  Not odious at present they look  I discern that their colours are bright  But their charms have my fancy forsook  And their fragrance forgot to delight  To my cooler attention how dear  The soothing complaint of the dove  I have left my companions to hear  The woodlinnet warble her love  Nor these can my footsteps retard  Or if round me they carelessly fly  From mine eyes they attract no regard  And my ears their soft warblings deny  Ah sure 'tis the bus'ness of life  That bids those endearments depart  To involve us in cares and in strife  That estrange and entangle the heart  With destiny all must comply  Yet cannot my fancy but mourn  For the season that fades from my eye  And the sweets that must never return  ON THE ETERNITY OF THE SUPREME BEING  BY CHRISTOPHER SMART M A  HAIL wond'rous Being who in power supreme  Exists from everlasting whose great name  Deep in the human heart and

colour of your lives  Whatever portion of itself his Wisdom  Shall deign t' allow still patiently abide  And praise him more and more nor cease to chaunt  ALL GLORY TO TH' OMNISCIENT AND PRAISE  AND POWER AND DOMINATION IN THE HEIGHT  And thou cherubic Gratitude whose voice  To pious ears sounds silverly so sweet  Come with thy precious incense bring thy gifts  And with thy choicest stores the altar crown  ΤΟ ΘΕΩ ΔΟΞΑ  ON THE POWER OF THE SUPREME BEING  BY THE SAME  " TREMBLE thou Earth th' anointed poet said  " At God's bright presence tremble all ye mountains  " And all ye hillocks on the surface bound"  Then once again ye glorious thunders roll  The Muse with transport hears ye once again  Convulse the solid continent and shake  Grand music of Omnipotence the isles  'Tis thy terrific voice thou God of Power  'Tis thy terrific voice all Nature hears it  Awaken'd and alarm'd she feels its force  In every spring she feels it every wheel  And every movement of her vast machine  Behold quakes Apennine behold recoils  Athos and all the hoaryheaded Alps  Leap from their bases at the godlike sound  But what is this celestial tho' the note  And proclamation of the reign supreme  Compar'd with such as for a mortal ear  Too great amaze the incorporeal worlds  Should ocean to his congregated waves  Call in each river cataract and lake  And with the watry world down an huge rock  Fall headlong in one horrible cascade  'Twere but the echo of the parting breeze  When Zephyr faints upon the lily's breast  'Twere but the ceasing of some instrument  When the last lingering undulation  Dies on the doubting ear if nam'd with sounds  So mighty so stupendous so divine  But not alone in the aërial vault  Does he the dread theocracy maintain  For oft enrag'd with his intestine thunders  He harrows up the bowels of the earth  And shocks the central magnetCities then  Totter on their foundations stately columns  Magnific walls and heavenassaulting spires  What tho' in haughty eminence erect  Stands the strong citadel and frowns defiance  On adverse hosts tho' many a bastion jut  Forth from the ramparts elevated mound  Vain the poor providence of human art  And mortal strength how vain while underneath  Triumphs his mining vengeance in th' uproar  Of shatter'd towers riven rocks and mountains  With clamour inconceivable uptorn  And hurl'd adown th' abyss Sulphureous pyrites  Bursting abrupt from darkness into day  With din outrageous and destructive ire  Augment the hideous tumult while it wounds  Th' afflicted ear and terrifies the eye  And rends the heart in twain Twice have we felt  Within Augusta's walls twice have we felt  Thy threaten'd indignation but ev'n Thou  Incens'd Omnipotent art gracious ever  Thy goodness infinite but mildly warn'd us  With mercyblended wrath O spare us still  Nor send more dire conviction we confess  That thou art He th' Almighty we believe  For at thy righteous power whole systems quake  For at thy nod tremble ten thousand worlds  Hark on the winged whirlwind's rapid rage  Which is and is not in a momenthark  On th' hurricane's tempestuous sweep he rides  Invincible and oaks and pines and cedars  And forests are no more For conflict dreadful  The West encounters East and Notus meets  In his caree  the Hyperborean blast  The lordly lions shuddering seek their dens  And fly like timorous deer the king of birds  Who dar'd the solar ray is weak of wing  And faints and falls and dieswhile He supreme  Stands stedfast in the center of the storm  Wherefore ye objects terrible and great  Ye thunders earthquakes and ye firefraught wombs  Of  ell volcanos whirlwinds hurricanes  And boiling billows hail in chorus join  To celebrate and magnify your Maker  Who yet in works of a minuter mould  Is not less manifest is not less mighty  Survey the magnet's sympathetic love  That wooes the yielding needle contemplate  Th' attractive amber's power invisible  Ev'n to the mental eye or when the blow  Sent from th' electric sphere assaults thy frame  Shew me the hand that dealt itbaffled here  By his Omnipotence Philosophy  Slowly her thoughts inadequate revolves  And stands with all his circling wonders round her  Like heavy Saturn in th' etherial space  Begirt with an inexplicable ring  If such the operations of his power  Which at all seasons and in every place  Rul'd by establish'd laws and current nature  Arrest th' attention Who O Who shall tell  His acts miraculous when his own decrees  Repeals he or suspends when by the hand  Of Moses or of Joshua or the mouths  Of his prophetic seers such deeds he wrought  Before th' astonish'd Sun's allseeing eye  That Faith was scarce a virtue Need I sing  The fate of Pharaoh and his numerous band  Lost in the reflux of the watry walls  That melted to their fluid state again  Need I recount how Sampson's warlike arm  With more than mortal nerves was strung t' o'erthrow  Idolatrous Philistia shall I tell  How David triumph'd and what Job sustain'd  But O supreme unutterable mercy  O love unequall'd mystery immense  Which angels long t' unfold 'tis man's redemption  That crowns thy glory and thy power confirms  Confirms the great th' uncontroverted claim  When from the Virgin's unpolluted womb  Shone forth the Sun of Righteousness reveal'd  And on benighted reason pour'd the day  Let there be peace he said and all was calm  Amongst the warring worldcalm as the sea  When O be still ye boisterous Winds he cried  And not a breath was blown nor murmur heard  His was a life of miracles and might  And charity and love e'er yet he taste  The bitter draught of death e'er yet he rise  Victorious o'er the universal foe  And Death and Sin and Hell in triumph lead  His by the right of conquest is mankind  And in sweet servitude and golden bonds  Were ty'd to him for everO how easy  Is his ungalling yoke and all his burdens  'Tis ecstacy to bear Him blessed Shepherd  His flocks shall follow thro' the maze of life  And shades that tend to Dayspring from on high  And as the radiant roses after fading  In fuller foliage and more fragrant breath  Revive in smiling spring so shall it fare  With those that love himfor sweet is their favour  And all eternity shall be their spring  Then shall the gates and everlasting doors  At which the KING OF GLORY enters in  Be to the Saints unbarr'd and there where pleasure  Boasts an undying bloom where dubious hope  Is certainty and griefattended love  Is freed from passionthere we'll celebrate  With worthier numbers Him who is and was  And in immortal prowess King of Kings  Shall be the Monarch of all worlds for ever  ON THE GOODNESS OF THE SUPREME BEING  BY THE SAME  ORPHEUS for  See this conjecture strongly supported by Delany in his Life of David  so the Gentiles call'd thy name  Israel's sweet Psalmist who alone could'st wake  Th' inanimate to motion who alone  The joyful hillocks the applauding rocks  And floods with musical persuasion drew  Thou who to hail and snow gav'st voice and sound  And mad'st the mute melodiousgreater yet  Was thy divinest skill and rul'd o'er more  Than art and nature for thy tuneful touch  Drove trembling Satan from the heart of Saul  And quell'd the evil Angelin this breast  Some portion of thy genuine spirit breathe  And lift me from myself each thought impure  Banish each low idea raise refine  Enlarge and sanctifyso shall the muse  Above the stars aspire and aim to praise  Her God on earth as he is prais'd in heaven  Immense Creator whose allpowerful hand  Fram'd universal Being and whose eye  Saw like thyself that all things form'd were good  Where shall the timorous bard thy praise begin  Where end the purest sacrifice of song  And just thanksgivingThe thoughtkindling light  Thy prime production darts upon my mind  Its vivifying beams my heart illumines  And fills my soul with gratitude and Thee  Hail to the chearful rays of ruddy morn  That paint the streaky East and blithsome rouse  The birds the cattle and mankind from rest  Hail to the freshness of the early breeze  And Iris dancing on the newfall'n dew  Without the aid of yonder golden globe  Lost were the garnet's lustre lost the lily  The tulip and auricula's spotted pride  Lost were the peacock's plumage to the sight  So pleasing in its pomp and glossy glow  O thriceillustrious were it not for Thee  Those pansies that reclining from the bank  View thro' th' immaculate pellucid stream  Their portraiture in the inverted heaven  Might as well change their tripled boast the white  The purple and the gold that far outvie  The Eastern monarch's garb ev'n with the dock  Ev'n with the baneful hemlock's irksome green  Without thy aid without thy gladsome beams  The tribes of woodland warblers would remain  Mute on the bending branches nor recite  The praise of him who e'er he form'd their lord  Their voices tun'd to transport wing'd their flight  And bade them call for nurture and receive  And lo they call the blackbird and the thrush  The woodlark and the redbreast jointly call  He hears and feeds their feather'd families  He feeds his sweet musiciansnor neglects  Th' invoking ravens in the greenwood wide  And tho' their throats coarse ruttling hurt the ear  They mean it all for music thanks and praise  They mean and leave ingratitude to man  But not to allfor hark the organs blow  Their swelling notes round the cathedral's dome  And grace th' harmonious choir celestial feast  To pious ears and med'cine of the mind  The thrilling trebles and the manly base  Join in accordance meet and with one voice  All to the sacred subject suit their song  While in each breast sweet melancholy reigns  Angelically pensive till the joy  Improves and purifiesthe solemn scene  The Sun thro' storied panes surveys with awe  And bashfully withholds each bolder beam  Here as her home from morn to eve frequents  The cherub Gratitudebehold her eyes  With love and gladness weepingly they shed  Ecstatic smiles the incense that her hands  Uprear is sweeter than the breath of May  Caught from the nectarine's blossom and her voice  Is more than voice can tell to him she sings  To him who feeds who clothes and who adorns  Who made and who preserves whatever dwells  In air in stedfast earth or sickle sea  O He is good he is immensely good  Who all things form'd and form'd them all for man  Who mark'd the climates varied every zone  Dispensing all his blessings for the best  In order and in beautyrise attend  Attest and praise ye quarters of the world  Bow down ye elephants submissive bow  To Him who made the mite tho' Asia's pride  Ye carry armies on your towercrown'd backs  And grace the turban'd tyrants bow to Him  Who is as great as perfect and as good  In his less striking wonders till at length  The eye's at fault and seeks th' assisting glass  Approach and bring from Araby the blest  The fragrant cassia frankincense and myrrh  And meekly kneeling at the altar's foot  Lay all the tributary incense down  Stoop sable Africa with reverence stoop  And from thy brow take off the painted plume  With golden ingots all thy camels load  T' adorn his temples hasten with thy spear  Reverted and thy trusty bow unstrung  While unpursued thy lions roam and roar  And ruin'd towers rude rocks and caverns wide  Remurmur to the glorious surly sound  And thou fair Indian whose immense domain  To counterpoise the Hemisphere extends  Haste from the West and with thy fruits and flowers  Thy mines and med'cines wealthy maid attend  More than the plenteousness so fam'd to flow  By fabling bards from Amalthea's horn  Is thine thine therefore be a portion due  Of thanks and praise come with thy brilliant crown  And vest of furr and from thy fragrant lap  Pomegranates and the rich  Ananas the Indian name for pineapples  ananas pour  But chiefly thou Europa seat of Grace  And Christian excellence his Goodness own  Forth from ten thousand temples pour his praise  Clad in the armour of the living God  Approach unsheath the Spirit's flaming sword  Faith's shield Salvation's glorycompass'd helm  With fortitude assume and o'er your heart  Fair truth's invulnerable breastplate spread  Then join the general chorus of all worlds  And let the song of charity begin  In strains seraphic and melodious prayer  " O allsufficient allbeneficent  " Thou God of Goodness and of Glory hear  " Thou who to lowliest minds dost condescend  " Assuming passions to enforce thy laws  " Adopting jealousy to prove thy love  " Thou who resign'd humility uphold  " Ev'n as the slorist props the drooping rose  " But quell tyrannic pride with peerless power  " Ev'n as the tempest rives the stubborn oak  " O allsufficient allbeneficent  " Thou God of Goodness and of Glory hear  " Bless all mankind and bring them in the end  " To heaven to immortality and THEE"  FINIS  INDEX TO THE FOURTH VOLUME  THE Valetudinarian an Ode  By Dr Marriott Page  The Royal Voyage  By the same  Ode on Death translated from
