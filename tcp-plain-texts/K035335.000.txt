Disquisition on Government and Civil Liberty it gave me much concern to find that you had not written it in verse Such images and such sentiments such wit and such arguments were surely too good to be wasted on prose And you who have written verse so long and with so much facility are highly inexcusable for not having employed that talent on so important an occasion as the present when you had taken upon you to confute  "so many absurd principles concerning government and liberty which have of  late  been disseminated with unusual industry"  principles let me add which were still more industriously disseminated at the Revolution by Locke at the Accession by Hoadly and a hundred years before either by Hooker  "principles which you say are as false as mischievous as inconsistent with common sense as with all human society and which require nothing more than to be fairly stated to be refuted"  The pious poet Herbert I think tells us that  "A verse may catch him who a sermon flies"  Why then should you discard verse when you intended to catch such careless readers as would be apt to fly a sermon Why by dividing your discourse into five methodical heads should you make it appear as formal as the gravest pulpitlecture ever delivered by old bishop Beveridge or young Bishop Bagot I protest Mr Jenyns I cannot account for this strange proceeding  However that such sort of readers may read you I have attempted to do that for your benefit and theirs which you would not do for them or for yourself and unequal as I am to the task have drest up your two first and as I think principal topics in as easy and fashionable metre as I was capable of writing I know you would have done this much better But as my work is but a fragment I am not without my hopes that what I have done may be a spur to your indolence and that you may be tempted not only to correct but complete it  But when I say that I have versified you I take a pride in boasting that I am not your mere versifier I take a pleasure too in owning that you yourself led me to attempt a nobler species of composition I had read some years ago your very delectable Eclogue of the 'Squire and the Parson written on occasion of that glorious peace the honour of making which is to be inscribed one day may it be a late one on the mausoleum of the Earl of Bute This Sir led me to think of giving my present performance a dramatic cast so far as an eclogue can  possess that title On this idea having resolved to make you my TITYRUS I had not far to seek for a MELIBAEUS A brother writer who has of late endeavoured to disseminate principles similar to some of yours with unusual though abortive industry immediately occurred to my imagination And as immediately I resolved to read his more elaborate treatise in order to enable me to execute my plan with greater exactitude and better preservation of sentiment and character  Although I must own that this exercitation of my patience cost me many a yawn yet I found to my great satisfaction that this writer allowed for true what you hold to be false those two first principles of Mr Locke that men are equal and that men are free  See  Tucker on Government  ch st  I concluded therefore that he was a very proper person to dispute those points with you Accordingly without farther ceremonial I set you both down not indeed sub tegmine fagi but for the sake of the  costum√©  in a snug town coffeehouse and there entered you fairly into debate  If on your part Sir I have ever done more than elucidated any of those assertions which you call arguments I humbly ask your pardon and on the Dean's if  I have made him a little too lively and spiritual  I as humbly ask his I know nothing does so much harm to an ecclesiastic in the road of perferment as the bare suspicion of being witty But as the Divine in question has long been a dean and has sworn that he will never be a bishop I hope no great harm is done  That you may long remain on the illustrious List of Pensioners even after the useful Board from which you derive that right shall be no more that having changed from Tory to Whig in the ministry of the Duke of Newcastle from Whig to Tory under those or rather  that  of Lords Bute and North you may now again change from Tory to Whig under the New Administrationand since we have it on very eloquent evidence that it is now the fashion for persons of the greatest consequence to be  no longer in shackles  that you may soon cease to be encumbered with your present slavish principles is the sincere and fervent wish of  SIR  Your most obsequious servant MALCOLM MACGREGGOR  Knightsbridge  May st  THE DEAN and the 'SQUIRE  IN Coffeehouse of good account  Not far from Bondstreet call'd  The Mount  Soame Jenyns met the Dean of Gloucester  And as they sate in lounging posture  Each on his bench and face to face  The Dean began in tone of bass  While Jenyns in his treble key  Replied with much alacrity  Repeat my Muse th' alternate strains  That flow'd from these Arcadian swains  Who both were equally alert  Or to deny or to assert  Arcades ambo  Et cantare pares respondere parati  VIRG  DEAN  'Squire Jenyns since with like intent  We both have writ on Government  And both stand stubborn as a rock  Against the principles of Locke  Let us like brother meeting brother  Compare our notes with one another  'Tis true I've not had time to look  Tho' much I wish'd it in your book  'SQUIRE  Doctor my book is quickly read  DEAN  I'd other crotchets in my head  The Dean had been employed in writing his  Cui Bono  to Mons Neckar which is said by persons who have read it to contain many curious crotchets  Cui Bono  But you I guess have studied mine  'SQUIRE  No to my shame not ev'n a line  DEAN  That's something strangeyet fortunate  For now on par we shall debate  'SQUIRE  True Who to play at whist regards  When he that deals has seen the cards  DEAN  Well put First then 'tis fit I deem  You tell me how you treat your theme  'SQUIRE  I controvert those five positions  Which Whigs pretend are the conditions  Of civil rule and liberty  That men are equal bornand free  That kings derive their lawful sway  All from the people's yea and nay  That compact is the only ground  On which a Prince his rights can found  Lastly I scout that idle notion  That government is put in motion  And stopt again like clock or chime  Just as we want them to keep time  DEAN  'Sblood do you controvert them all  'SQUIRE  Indeed I do Sir great and small  DEAN  You're a bold man my master Jenyns  And have good right to count your winnings  If you succeedBut I who dare  As much as most to go so far  Had not the courage I assure ye  Tho' I suborned a tory jury  Before the Dean published his elaborate treatise he printed it first only for the perusal of certain friends who were either Tories from principle or discre  ion It may therefore reasonably be supposed that in Milton's phrase it  numbered  many  choice intellects  among our great churchmen The mitred author of the Letter to the CocoaTree written at the commencement of Lord Bute's administration from which I have taken my motto was amongst these personages and it is not to be doubted but it would receive many improvements from his adroit and masterly hand  'SQUIRE  That men were equal born at first  I hold of all whig lies the worst  But yet if only this they mean  That you and I good Mr Dean  Were equally produced 'tis true  For I was born as much as you  But now comparing size and strength  Our body's bulk our nose's length  The periwigs that grace our pate  My little wit your learning great  We find we are unequal quite  DEAN  My honest friend you're too polite  Your wit Lord Hardwicke deigns to own  Surpasses every wit's in town  And none e'er doubted Hardwicke's taste  Who e'er were bid to Hardwicke's feast  But yet I fear at this arch quibble  The Lockians will do more than nibble  They say and with them I agree  That as to men's equality  It rests on native rights they have  Not to become another's slave  Or tamely bear a tyrant's yoke  The passage in Mr Locke's treatise which the Dean here alludes to seems to be this  "Though I said  that all men are by nature equal  I cannot be supposed to understand all sorts of equality age or virtue may give men a just precedency excellency of parts and merit may place others above the common level birth may subject some and alliance or benefits others to pay an observance to those to whom nature gratitude or other respects may have made it due and yet all this consists with the  equality  which all men are in in respect of jurisdiction or dominion one over another which was the equality I there ch d spoke of as proper to the business in hand being that  equal right  that every man hath  to his natural freedom  without being subjected to the will or authority of any other man"  Ch sec  To this the Dean accedes in his first chapter  "First then I agree with Mr Locke and his disciples that there is a sense in which it may be said that no man is born the political subject of another"  This truth you parry with a joke  'SQUIRE  Jokes Mr Dean I'd have you know  Have parried many a stouter blow  A joke like this as I conceive  Is reason's representative  Who vested with his rights is sent  To disputation's parliament  DEAN  Yet scorns like some they patriots call  To vote as he  instructs  at all  'SQUIRE  Sometimes he maybut to proceed  All men at birth it is agreed  Have equal learning wit and power  Tho' at Lucina's squalling hour  The newborn babes in nurse's lap  Have only power to suck her pap  Good heavens to talk of wit and learning  In infants void of all discerning  Is just as if these whigs disputed  As most fools do to be confuted  Whether their teeth in breadth and length  Had equal size and equal strength  When bless each little slobbering mouth  It had not cut a single tooth  DEAN  Your instance I confess is pretty  I wish it were as apt as witty  'SQUIRE  But let us give them all they ask  Their equal birth a harder task  I think remains behind to prove  That men thro' life must equal move  None e'er assume a jot of power  More than he had at natal hour  Strange doctrine this ye whigs shall none  Be long and lank as Jenkinson  None grow to full six feet or more  Because some only measure four  Or because Hunter cannot treat us  With different size of sameaged faetus  Thus Mr Dean the point I've prov'd  And if your Reverence is so mov'd  You'll find with like facility  I prove they all are not born free  DEAN  My sprightly 'Squire if this be proving  Then billing is the whole of loving  Dame Logic knows whene'er I meet her  With more substantial sport I treat her  These whigs will answer your demand  With saying all they understand  By power is "That alone is just  "Which to a few the rest entrust  "And to assume without assent  "Is force not legal government"  So Locke  "Government into whatsoever hands it is put being  intrusted  with this condition and for this end that men might have and secure their properties the prince or senate however it may have power to make laws for the regulating of property between the subjects one amongst another yet can never have a power to take to themselves the whole or any part of the subjects property without their own  consent  for this would be in effect to leave them no property at all"  Ch xi sec  As to your simile of size  They'll say your brains are in your eyes  But now go on  'SQUIRE  Their next assertion  You'll find affords me more diversion  For how should men be e'er born free  When to be born is slavery  An imposition in itself  Do parents ask the little elf  Ere they beget him his good leave  Or to beget or to conceive  Or does he approbation give  By self or representative  DEAN  Yet when begot in my opinion  He's then the heir to selfdominion  Has right both to be born and bred  To suck the breast  'SQUIRE  And phis bed  DEAN  He has Nay more I'd have you know  Protection while in embrio  Is his e'er you can justly date  His  quasicompact  with the state  "Children are entitled to protection  whilst in embrio  though they neither did nor could enter into any compact with the state for that purpose"  Tucker on Civil Government p  I have taken the liberty to add the term  quasi  in my version of this passage to make it more analogous to the learned writer's general sentiments who allows of no compact but what he is pleased to term  quasi  Once Sir I knew a pious lady  Who just as she was getting ready  For church one EasterSunday morn  With labourpains was sorely torn  The church good soul she lov'd so dearly  That with her spouse she chose to parley  Nor would she let the midwife lay her  Till she had been at morning prayer  When lo in midst of all this fray  Before mama had time to pray  Her heir a freeborn British boy  Bolted to light and liberty  'SQUIRE  Your story Mr Dean is pleasant  And wrapt withal in terms right decent  Yet vainly sure such proof you bring  One swallow does not make a spring  I say in spite of your strange tale  For full nine months he lies in jail  And what a jail so little roomy  So dank so sultry and so gloomy  Howard who ev'ry prison knows  Ne'er ventur'd there to thrust his nose  Yet there he lies unlucky wight  Depriv'd of sunshine and of sight  Floating in brine like a young porpus  Till by obstetric Habeas Corpus  The brat is pluck'd to liberty  But tell me is such freedom free  In swaddling cloaths he now is bound  Like Styx  Tho' Fate had fast bound her  With Styx nine times round her  Pope's Ode on St Caecilia's Day  that gird him nine times round  They squeeze his navel press his head  Feed him with water and with bread  Thus nine months more he lies in chains  And when his freedom he regains  He puts it to so bad a use  'Tis found he must not yet go loose  Tyrannic nurse then claims her right  To plague him both by day and night  Then grave as Pope and gruff as Turk  Prelatic schoolmaster like York  Thrashes the wretch with grammar's flail  To mend his head corrects his tail  And this with most despotic fury  Heedless of mercy law and jury  DEAN  Sir you've a happy vein for satire  And touch it with a  main du maitre  Yet why Sir treat mild M*****m thus  His Grace you know is one of us  'SQUIRE  I ask his pardon At the time  He chanc'd to hitch into my rhyme  Had not this unlucky bolt been shot by the 'Squire it is probable the Dean would not have been thrown off his scent but would have answered all that had been asserted in some such manner as Mr Locke does  "Children I confess are not born in this full state of  equality  though they are born to it Their parents have a sort of rule and jurisdiction over them when they come into the world and for some time after but it is but a temporary one The bonds of this subjection are like the swaddling cloths they are wrapt up in and supported by in the weakness of their infancy age and reason as they grow up loosen them till at length they drop quite off and leave a man at his own free disposal"  Ch sec  This passage and the other two already quoted seem to be a sufficient answer to Mr Jenyns on his two first heads All his objections turn on the term  born  whereas Locke's propositions are  "Men are by nature equal and by nature free"  that is have equal natural rights in their persons and liberty  But to our pointthus far I've stated  The boy is born and educated  And now he walks the world at large  Yet has he got a free discharge  No  volens nolens  as at school  He still must yield to civil rule  A subject born he's subject still  Not govern'd by his mere selfwill  But if he breaks the laws in force  Or kills his man or steals a horse  Howe'er he may dispute their right  And Coke with Burgersdicius fight  Must make at Tyburn his confession  DEAN  I fear Sir here you beg the question  A subject born in any state  May if he please depatriate  And go for reasons weak or weighty  To ZealandNew or Otaheite  'SQUIRE  Yet there what freedom will he have  When made Queen Oberea's slave  Her majesty may lay a tax  I fear would weaken stronger backs  Than ev'n was your's my doughty Dean  When nerv'd with youth and stout eighteen  DEAN  Perhaps she might Then let's suppose  To some unpeopled isle he goes  And takes a mistress in his sleeve  To live as Adam did with Eve  Or say that he had luck to find  A hundred more of the same mind  To migrate with their mates by dozens  And there to live like catercousins  We will not call them sirs and madams  But a cool hundred Eves and Adams  I think they would or soon or late  By  quasicompact  found a state  Here the Dean turns aside to his own ingenious hypothesis which he makes the true basis of civil government and which the more to disseminate it I shall here briefly explain He supposes that a hundred Adams and Eves should all be produced full grown and in  conjugal pairs  and then concludes that they would naturally herd together and form a civil society from their instinctive love of living together as gregarious animals But as some might object that another instinctive appetite would speedily disturb the peace of this society and that Horace's  tetrrima belli causa  might make it a state of war he sagely provides against this by noting  "that the appetite between the sexes can have no place in the question because it is not of that sort which renders mankind gregarious"  Yet as he also owns  "that the most solitary animals at certain seasons  converse  in pairs"  it is necessary for the support of his hypothesis that all his Adams and Eves should be as chaste as turtles and therefore I have called them a  cool  hundred an epithet which the reader sees is here far from being an expletive but highly emphatical for if the Dean's hundred Adams and Eves were not more  cool  than an hundred pairs of people of fashion whom I could mention it is to be feared that many of the males in his civil society would not only be  gregarious animals  but absolutely  horned cattle  See Tucker on Government p  What think you 'Squire of that Scotch peer  The late Lord Fairfax usually distinguished by the name of  Lord Fairfax of Virginia  Who wenching held so very dear  I don't aver his taste was right  In liking black girls more than white  Not that I rashly would decide  They know the best who both have tried  That to indulge and take his fill  He fenc'd an Apalachian hill  And holding there supreme command  "Scatter'd his image o'er the land"  Dryden  Till soon he got so large a race  Of little tawny babes of grace  And these so soon begot a second  And those a third that quick he reckon'd  Subjects enough of his own blood  To reign their sovereign great and good  If such a man was not born free  I know not what is liberty  'SQUIRE  Dear Dean you interrupt my theme  I want to preach but you to dream  Of negro girls and patriarch kings  Pray clip your fancy's wayward wings  My two points prov'd I draw from hence  This truly Christian inference  That all whom we the factious call  Who 'gainst court influence hourly bawl  Who from their seats would dash contractors  And be themselves the nation's factors  Are all of the old roundhead leaven  And therefore ne'er will get to heaven  DEAN  Right This would give my mind much ease  If drawn from sounder premises  Locke and his crew I know right well  Have sent full many a fool to hell  But not from what you've prov'd but I  Hold Muse nor give the 'Squire's reply  You've run two heats to start a third  Would now I think be quite absurd  'Tis much beyond an Eclogue's length  Come breath a while and gather strength  You shall not tax should it be willing  The town beyond a single shilling  Though the Author chooses to be so very moderate in his mode of taxation I his bookseller in strict conformity to our rule of trade have ventured to lay on the other sixpence DEBRETT  Stop then in time your tinkling rill  The reader's ears have drank their fill  Claudite jam rivos pueri sat prata biberunt  VIRG  THE END  CERTIFICATE  WHEREAS a late ingenious and anonymous production entitled  An Archaeological Epistle  has been attributed to my pen I think proper to declare that however I may approve the political sentiments therein contained I am above wearing any man's laurels and that I conceive those who do not discriminate between my style and that author's have as little critical acumen as he seems to allow to his reverend correspondent  Signed MALCOLM
